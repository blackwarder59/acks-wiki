# Chapter 3: Monster Rules

## Attributes for Monsters

In *ACKS,* human and demi-human characters are assigned ability scores between 3 and 18 in Strength, Intelligence, Wisdom, Dexterity, Constitution, and Charisma, representing their ability in these areas relative to the human average of 10.

Monsters can also be assigned ability scores. For simplicity, we assume most monsters are average specimens of their species, with ability scores of 9 in all characteristics. Note that a monster’s ability scores are *not* measured against the human average. A horse with INT 18 is smart *for a horse*,but is not capable of tool use or mathematics*.* A giant with STR 7 is quite weak *for a giant*, but is still considerably stronger than a man!

As with human and demi-human characters, a monstrous ability score of less than 9 or greater than 12 will provide a bonus or penalty on rolls and throws related to the ability score. Except as noted below, the bonus or penalty is identical to that for human and demi-human characters.

### Strength

The bonus or penalty to attack throws and damage rolls is adjusted by how damaging the monster’s natural attacks are. Cross-reference the monster’s STR score with its average damage from each natural attack on the table below to find the bonus or penalty to the attack throws and damage rolls.

|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Ability Score** | **2 or less** | **3 – 6** | **7-12** | **13-24** | **25 or more** |
| 3 | -2 | -3 | -6 | -8 | -12 |
| 4 | -1 | -2 | -5 | -7 | -10 |
| 5 | -1 | -2 | -4 | -6 | -8 |
| 6 | 0 | -1 | -3 | -4 | -6 |
| 7 | 0 | -1 | -2 | -3 | -4 |
| 8 | 0 | -1 | -1 | -2 | -3 |
| 9 | 0 | 0 | 0 | -1 | -2 |
| 10 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 11 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 12 | 0 | 0 | 0 | +1 | +2 |
| 13 | 0 | +1 | +1 | +2 | +3 |
| 14 | 0 | +1 | +2 | +3 | +4 |
| 15 | 0 | +1 | +3 | +4 | +6 |
| 16 | +1 | +2 | +4 | +6 | +8 |
| 17 | +1 | +2 | +5 | +7 | +10 |
| 18 | +2 | +3 | +6 | +8 | +12 |

EXAMPLE #1: A dragon turtle deals 1d8 points of damage (4.5 average) with its claws and 1d6x10 (35 average) with its bite. A dragon turtle with STR 18 gets +3 to hit and damage with its claws and +12 to hit and damage with its bite.

EXAMPLE #2: A medium raptor deals 1d2 points of damage (1.5 average) with its talons. A medium raptor with STR 4 has -1 to hit and damage with its talons. A medium raptor with STR 18 has +2 to hit and damage.

A creature’s maximum load is adjusted by its STR modifier x (normal load/10). (Most creatures have a maximum load equal to twice their normal load, see p. XX). A humanoid creature’s maximum load is adjusted by its STR modifier x (normal load/5), rounded to the nearest stone. Round 0.5 up if negative, down if positive.

EXAMPLE #1: A dragon turtle has a normal load of 2,300 stone. Therefore, it has a maximum load of 4,600 stone. A dragon turtle with STR 18 has its maximum load increased by [3 x (2,300/10)] 414 stone to 5,014 stone.

### Intelligence

Monsters can be mindless, bestial, semi-sapient, or sapient. Sapient monsters, such as giants, humanoids, most undead (except skeletons and zombies), and some monstrosities, can gain bonus proficiencies and languages from an Intelligence bonus just as a human or demi-human character does. A sapient monster that casts arcane spells (such as dragons) can increase the number of spells of each level in its repertoire by its Intelligence bonus.

EXAMPLE: A mature adult dragon capable of speech has a repertoire of 2 1st, 2 2nd, and 2 3rd level spells. A mature adult dragon with INT 16 has its repertoire increased to 4 1st, 4 2nd, and 4 3rd level spells.

Semi-sapient and bestial monsters do not gain proficiencies, languages, or spells from their INT bonus. The monster’s Intelligence instead determines how easy the monster is to train. The number of tricks such a monster may be taught by an animal trainer is equal to 5 plus the INT bonus or penalty. The number of tricks therefore ranges from 2 to 8. Some monsters are innately more or less trainable and have a **trainability modifier** applied to their maximum number of tricks. See **Taming and Training Monsters**, below, for more details.

*“Tim is In Trouble” Memorial Rule:* If a creature of bestial intelligence has a combined INT modifier plus trainability modifierof 3 or more, it can (at your discretion) be considered semi-sapient and capable of learning primitive communication, simple math, and basic tool use.

EXAMPLE: Tim, an enchanter, is the proud owner of Lacey, a hunting dog (trainability modifier +2) of unusual intelligence for her kind (INT 18). Because Lacey’s combined INT and trainability modifiers combine to 5, she is semi-sapient. Thus, when Tim falls down a 10’ pit, Lacey is able to rush to his companions and alert them that Tim is in trouble with sharp barks, even though she hasn’t been taught a trick to do this.

Mindless monsters, such as most constructs (except gargoyles) and all oozes, do not have Intelligence scores or trainability modifiers.

### Dexterity

Non-humanoid monsters have their speed adjusted by their DEX modifier. The creature’s encounter speed is adjusted by 10’ x DEX bonus x (Speed/120’). Its combat speed is adjusted by one-third the encounter speed adjustment. A creature’s ability to travel long distances quickly is limited by its stamina as well as its speed, so its expedition speed is adjusted by the lower of DEX or CON bonus x 2 miles x (Speed/120’).

EXAMPLE: A light horse has an encounter speed of 240’, combat speed of 80’, and wilderness rate of 48 miles per day. A light horse with DEX 18 (+3 bonus) and CON 14 (+1) has its encounter speed adjusted by (10’ x 3 x 240’ / 120’) = 60’, yielding an adjusted encounter speed of 300’. Its combat speed is increased from 80’ by (60’/3) to 100’. Its expedition speed is limited by its CON bonus of +1, so it is increased by just (1 x 2 x 240’/120’) 2 miles, to 50 miles per day.

### Constitution

For monsters other than constructs and undead, the CON score represents general health and vitality. For constructs, the CON score represents the sturdiness of construction. For undead, the CON score represents the negative animus which sustains its baneful existence. In all cases, the bonus or penalty from Constitution is added as a modifier to each Hit Die roll. (Monsters who have advanced in HD beyond the maximum permitted for their size may not apply their CON modifier towards those HD; see p. XX.)

EXAMPLE: A storm giant has 15 HD, so it rolls 15d8 for its hit points. If the storm giant has CON 16, it will roll 15d8+30 for its hit points.

### Charisma

Add the monster’s Charisma bonus or penalty to its morale score and to the morale score of any monsters it leads. Mindless monsters (such as skeletons) do not have Charisma scores.

## Proficiencies for Monsters

Like human and demi-human characters, some monsters also possess proficiencies. However, most monsters do not spend their lives training for dungeon encounters with adventurers, and their proficiency choices tend to favor everyday skills such as Animal Husbandry, Endurance, Labor, Navigation, Survival, or Trapping. For the most part, these will have little impact on play, and for simplicity can be ignored. If a monster is exceptionally intelligent, dangerous, or well-trained, though, you can use the rules below to assign proficiencies to it.

A sapient monster begins with the Monster proficiency as well as one class proficiency and one general proficiency.

**Monster:** The monster is well-equipped for life as a creature of its kind. The specific tasks which are covered by this proficiency are determined by the type of creature, but will generally include knowing how to find food, secure shelter, easily open stuck dungeon doors, wait patiently for prey, collect treasure for barter, etc. This is the equivalent of the Adventuring proficiency for monsters.

In addition, a monster with an Intelligence bonus will gain additional general proficiencies equal to this bonus. If a monster has more HD than normal for its species (such as an orc chieftain with 4 HD), it earns additional class and general proficiencies; treat each HD gained as a class level of fighter. A monster also gains an additional general proficiency when it reaches the middle aged, old, and ancient age categories for its species.

EXAMPLE: Bailshar is a middle aged orc chieftain (4 HD) of exceptional intelligence (INT 16, +2). Having seen a prior chief slain by adventurers while he was but a whelp, he has ruthlessly trained himself to be ready for the next band of “heroes” who attacks his village. Bailshar begins play with Monster (orc) proficiency, plus one class and one general proficiency. Having gained 3 HD more than the average orc, he counts as having gained three fighter levels for proficiency purposes, so this adds one additional class proficiency (for a total of two). His high INT earns him two more general proficiencies, and middle age provides one more (for a total of four). The Judge selects Combat Reflexes and Command as Bailshar’s class proficiencies. He chooses Animal Training, Leadership, Manual of Arms, and Military Strategy as Bailshar’s general proficiencies. When the Judge designs the dungeon where Bailshar rules, he stocks it with trained animals and notes that the orcs are trained in small-unit tactics and have exceptional morale (from Bailshar’s Command proficiency).

### Ageless Monsters

Creatures who lack some or all age categories will gain fewer or no proficiencies with age. For instance, elves remain at the Adult age category until death, so they do not gain general proficiencies for reaching an Old or Ancient age category.

### Transformed Monsters

Sometimes a sapient monster may be transformed from one type of creature to another type with a different set of age categories, or no age categories at all. For instance, a dwarf might be transformed into a vampire. When this occurs, the creature continues to gain proficiencies based on its original age categories. Once it reaches its original ancient age category, it ceases gaining proficiencies from age, even if it lives for millennia thereafter. (Sorry, liches.)

EXAMPLE: As a reward for his loyal service to the local dark lord, Bailshar the orc chieftain is transformed into a vampire. He is 37 years old (Middle Aged for an orc) when this occurs. As a vampire, he ceases aging. Nevertheless, when he reaches 45 years of age (Old for an orc), Bailshar gains an additional general proficiency. He gains an additional general proficiency when he turns 60 (Ancient for an orc). He then endures centuries of apathy without gaining any proficiencies, eventually taking a walk at dawn at age 1,040 out of boredom.

## Monstrous Henchmen

The monstrous henchman – be it the white wolf at the side of a black-clad ranger, the draconic mount of a young champion, the noble steed of a gleaming knight, or the beastman chief at the side of the evil overlord – is a staple of fantasy literature. The rules below allow adventurers to recruit monsters as henchmen and advance them in power over time.

### Recruiting Monstrous Henchmen

Adventurers with Beast Friendship proficiency or Friends of Birds and Beasts class power can recruit animals (including giant and prehistoric animals) as henchmen. All adventurers can recruit sapient monsters of the beastman, giant, humanoid, monstrosity, and undead types. Monsters (of whatever type) count against the total number of henchmen the character can lead.

Before being recruited, monsters must first be found. Normal animals, such as hunting dogs or warhorses, can of course be found and purchased in markets using the standard rules for Equipment Availability by Market Class (***ACKS II RR****,* p. 39). Small numbers of sapient monsters might be available for hire in large towns and cities. Otherwise, monstrous henchmen must be recruited from those encountered on dungeon delves, wilderness expeditions, and sea journeys.

To be recruited, monstrous henchmen must have fewer HD than their employer has levels. A 1st level character can recruit monsters with 1-1 HD or less. A 14th level character could recruit monsters of less than 14 HD. Monsters with 14 HD or more (such as giant rocs) can only be recruited as henchmen by other, more powerful monsters.

A monster can only be offered employment at the start of an encounter if the monster’s reactions are Neutral, Indifferent, or Friendly (see *ACKS,* p. 99). Alternatively, a monster can be offered employment at the close of combat if it is defeated and captured. In either case, the adventurer must be able to intelligibly communicate with the monster.

When an adventurer attempts to recruit a monster, you should determine the monster’s response to an employment offer with a reaction roll of 2d6. If the monster was found in a market or peacefully encountered on an adventure, you should make the reaction roll on the Reaction to Hiring Offer table (*ACKS,* p. 49) to determine the result. If the monster was defeated and captured, you should use the Irrefusable Offer table, below. The adventurer’s CHA modifier is applied as a die roll modifier, along with any bonuses for Diplomacy, Intimidation, or other proficiencies. If the adventurer and the monster are of opposite alignments, apply a -2 penalty. If the monster is independent, apply its morale modifier (if any) as a negative modifier to the recruitment roll. If the monster was part of a group (warband or tribe) defeated in battle, apply its previous leader’s morale modifier (if any) instead. You can apply any other adjustments you feel are appropriate.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Irrefusable Offer** | |
| **Adjusted Die Roll (2d6)** | **Result** |
| 2- | Betrayal |
| 3-5 | Escape |
| 6-8 | Hesitate |
| 9-11 | Accept |
| 12+ | Accept with élan |

**Betray** means that the monster will pretend to accept the offer in order to betray the adventurer when the opportunity presents itself. The monster secretly hates and loathes its “employer” and will actively work against the adventurer’s interests.

**Escape** means that the monster will pretend to accept the offer in order to save its own life. It will desert from the adventurer’s service if an opportunity to safely do so presents itself. The monster might attempt to harm the adventurer during the course of its desertion if able to do so, but escape rather than betrayal will be its objective.

**Hesitate** means that the monster will accept the offer, but it feels uncertain loyalties. It begins its service with a loyalty score of -2 instead of 0. **Accept** means that the monster becomes loyal to the character, with a loyalty score of 0. **Accept with élan** means the offer is accepted with very good spirit, and the henchmen’s loyalty score begins at +1.

### Paying Monstrous Henchmen

Sapient monstrous henchmen are typically hired for a half-share of treasure and a monthly fee for food, lodging, and expenses. The monstrous henchmen’s monthly fee is determined using the Henchmen Monthly Fee table (*ACKS,* p. 51), substituting Hit Dice for level.

An animal henchman need not be paid a share of the adventurer’s income, but its care and training is nevertheless quite expensive. These costs are equal to the animal’s supply cost (p. XX) plus additional costs equal to the wages of a henchmen of its Hit Dice (*ACKS,* p. 51).

### Advancing Monstrous Henchmen

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Monster Size and Hit Dice** | |
| **Size** | **Maximum Hit Dice** |
| Man-Sized or less | 9 |
| Large | 13 |
| Huge | 17 |
| Gigantic | 25 |
| Colossal | 40 |

A monstrous henchman may advance its characteristics through adventuring. It requires 3,000 XP plus 500 XP per special ability (\*) for a 1 HD monster to advance to 2 HD. The amount of XP required doubles with each HD (round values greater than 20,000 XP to the nearest 1,000).

Monsters have a maximum Hit Dice determined by their size, as shown on the Monster Size and Hit Dice table. Sapient monsters may advance past this limit by up to an additional 5 Hit Dice, but gain a fixed 2 hp per HD with no Constitution bonus while doing so. Enchanted creatures (of any type) and undead may advance in Hit Dice without limit.

EXAMPLE: A leopard is a man-sized animal with 4 HD. It requires 24,000 XP for the leopard to advance to 5 HD; 48,000 XP to advance to 6 HD; 96,000 XP to advance to 7HD; 192,000 XP to 8HD, and 384,000 XP to advance to 9 HD. It cannot advance further because 9 HD is the maximum for a man-sized animal. If the leopard were an orc, it could continue to advance an additional 5 HD (up to 14) but would only gain 2 hp per each of the last 5 HD, with no CON modifier. If the leopard were an enchanted creature, it could continue to advance in HD without limit.

As a monster advances in Hit Dice, apply the following improvements to its characteristics:

* The monster’s attack throws improve by one per Hit Die.
* The monster’s saving throws improve based on its save progression relative to its HD (see p. XX).
* The monster’s AC improves by ½ (1 per 2 HD), to a maximum of its own starting HD.
* The monster deals an average of 2 hp more damage divided among all its attacks. You should decide how this is manifested. The Monster Attack Table (p. XX) can be used to calculate new damage dice if desired.
* If sapient, the monster may gain proficiencies as if it had advanced as a fighter (see p. XX). If of animal intelligence, the monster gains the ability to learn one additional trick.

EXAMPLE: A leopard has advanced from 4 HD to 5 HD, so it gains 1d8 hit points, its attack throw improves from 7+ to 6+, and it may learn one additional trick. Its AC was already 5, so it cannot improve. Its average damage increases by 2 points. A 4 HD panther deals an average of 9.5 points of damage across all of its attacks (1d4 from each claw and 1d8 from its bite). To increase average damage to 11.5, the Judge decides that the leopard’s claw damage improves from 1d4 to 1d6. This yields an average of 11.5 points of damage, as 3.5 (1d6 claw) + 3.5 (1d6 claw) + 4.5 (1d8 bite) = 11.5.

## Noncombatant Monsters

Some species of monster are differentiated into combatants and noncombatants. This differentiation typically occurs when the species has substantial sexual dimorphism (where one sex is much larger and more aggressive than the other) and/or when the species is sapient and not all of its members are equally trained for combat. Beastmen are an example of both, so their monster listings in *ACKS* show sharp differentiation in the characteristics for combatants and noncombatants.

Depending on how much they differ in size, aggression, and training, noncombatant monsters may have anywhere from 25% to 75% of the HD and average hit points of combatants of the same species. A noncombatant monster’s AC, damage, and morale are also typically adjusted to reflect that of a similar creature of reduced HD. Noncombatants with fewer than ¼ HD have 1 hp and ML -4. If attacked, they must make a morale roll every round, and if defeated, they do not provide XP.

EXAMPLE: A bugbear has 3+1 HD (13.5 average hp). A noncombatant bugbear has 1+1 HD (5.5 average hp, or 40% of 13.5), and have their damage and morale adjusted to reflect that of a 1+1 HD hobgoblin.

### Noncombatant Monsters and Experience Points

Noncombatant monsters that earn XP can become combatants. For noncombatant monsters of 1 HD or less to become a combatant, it must earn 100 XP plus 15 XP per hit point bonus or special ability (\*). The amount of XP required doubles with each HD (round values greater than 20,000 XP to the nearest 1,000). Noncombatants that become combatants immediately get +1 hit point per full Hit Die; each 4 hit points gained in this manner equals 1 Hit Die. The new combatant may thereafter gain HD or levels following the normal rules (see *ACKS,* p. XX, XX, and XX).

EXAMPLE: A noncombatant troll (4+1 HD, one special ability) requires [(100+15+15) x 2x2x2] 1,040 XP to become a combatant. Upon becoming a combatant, it immediately gets +4 hp; since every full +4 hp equals 1 HD, the troll becomes a 5+1 HD monster.

## Young and Old Monsters

Some lairs may include cubs, foals, fledglings, and other young monsters; others may include middle aged, old, or ancient monsters. Except as otherwise noted in the monster listing, monster characteristics should be adjusted as shown on the Monster Age Adjustment table, below. Armor Class is reduced by 1 or more points, while movement, Hit Dice, normal load, and damage should be reduced to a fraction of normal value, depending on age. The following additional rules apply:

* Baby monsters are two size categories smaller than adults, while juvenile monsters are one size category smaller. Adolescent and older monsters are a full size (more or less).
* When calculating HD, treat each +/-1 as +/-0.25. Round the result to the nearest 0.25 and convert it back into +/-. Monsters reduced to fewer than ¼ HD have 1 hp and do not fight at all.
* When calculating Speed, multiply the adjustment by the creature’s speed/120’. Round to the nearest 30’. Monsters do not gain the ability to fly until they reach adolescent age except where otherwise noted.
* When calculating normal load, round to the nearest stone. Round 0.5 up if negative, down if positive.
* When calculating damage, the Monster Age Damage calculator table can be used to find new damage values for each of the monster’s attacks. Find the damage from the monster’s attack and cross-reference it with the age to find the new damage. A value of “-” means the monster of that age is too weak to deal damage with that attack.
* Monsters do not gain any special abilities until they reach adolescent age except where otherwise noted.
* Young or old monsters with fewer than ¼ HD are noncombatants with 1 hp and ML -4. If attacked, they must make a morale roll every round, and if defeated, they do not provide XP.

| \*Per 120’ of encounter speed, non-humanoid monsters only. | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |

EXAMPLE: An adult lion has AC 3, HD 5, hp 22, MV 150’, and maximum load 50. It has an attack throw of 6+ and deals 1d4+1 points of damage with its claws and 1d10 with its bite. An ancient lion has AC 0, HD 1+2, hp 7, MV 115’, and normal load 21. As a 1+2 HD creature, it has an attack throw of 9+ and deals 1 point of damage with its claws and 1d2 damage with its bite.

### Aging for Monsters with Ability Scores

The age adjustments above were actually developed by applying the normal effects of aging (*ACKS,* p. 248XX) to a monster with default ability scores of 9 in each characteristic.

|  |
| --- |
| In the example below, the ancient lion’s characteristics when calculated with ability score adjustments were nearly identical to those of an ancient lion’s characteristics calculated using the Monster Age Adjustment table. This will not always be the case. Sometimes the results will differ between different ability score breakpoints and Hit Die ranges. In-world, this can be considered the normal variability of the effects of aging. The Judge may use whichever method he prefers for any given monster. |

If you are using ability scores for the monster (p. XX), then the aging effects for AC, speed, HD, and damage can be calculated by applying the appropriate penalty (-6, -4, or -2) for the age category (Baby/Ancient, Child/Old, and Adolescent/Middle-Aged) respectively.

Adjustments for size and maximum load should still be applied using the Monster Age Adjustment table.

EXAMPLE: An adult lion with 9 STR, DEX, and CON has AC 3, HD 5, MV 150’, and maximum load 50. It has an attack throw of 6+ and deals 1d4+1 points of damage with its claws and 1d10 with its bite. Years later, it has become ancient, leaving it with 3 STR, DEX, and CON. This reduces its AC to 0 and its MV by 35’ to 115’ [150’ – (30’ x 150’/120’)], and maximum load to 50 – [3 x 25/10] 42. As a 5 HD creature with a -3 STR penalty, it has an attack throw of 9+. It deals 1d4-3 points of damage with its claws and 1d10-3 damage with its bite. Its HD are reduced by 3 points per die, from 22 down to 7.

## Taming and Training Monsters

Characters who capture monsters might be able to tame and train them, or sell them to NPCs interested in doing so. The following rules expand on the mechanics for Animal Training presented in the *ACKS* core rules.

### Overview of Taming and Training

**Taming** a monster teaches it submit to being handled without threatening or injuring its handler or the handler’s companions. **Training** a monster teaches it one or more **tricks**, such as responding to verbal commands. Taming and training monsters is performed by Animal Trainer specialists.

Animals, vermin, and bestial or semi-sapient monstrosities must be tamed before they can be trained. Giants, humanoids, and sapient monstrosities cannot be tamed. They can voluntarily accept training, however. Usually sapient monsters would only need to be trained if they were to serve as mounts or war mounts. Constructs, incarnations, oozes, and undead can be neither tamed nor trained. The Taming and Training Monsters table lists all monsters which can be tamed and trained.

Each monster has a **training period**. The training period for most monsters is one to three months, but exceptionally stupid or willful monsters may have a much longer training period. Ittakes one training period to initially tame a monster. It then takes one additional training period to teach a tame monster its first trick. (Sapient monsters which have voluntarily accepted training can proceed to learning tricks without needing to be tamed.). After a monster has learned its first trick, additional tricks can be taught in half a training period each. The training period for each creature is listed on the Taming and Training Monsters table.

EXAMPLE: A war dog has a training period of one month. A juvenile war dog can be tamed in one month, taught its first trick in another month, and then learn another trick every two weeks thereafter. In contrast, a tiger has a training period of six months. It takes six months to tame a juvenile tiger, another six months to teach the juvenile tiger its first trick, and another three months for each subsequent trick.

The training period assumes that the taming and training process begins when the monster is a baby or child. If the taming and training process begins when the monster is already an adult or adolescent, then the training period is increased. For adult domestic animals, the period is increased 4x for taming and 2x for each trick. For other adult monsters, the training period is increased to 12x taming and 6x for each trick.

EXAMPLE: One day while out hunting in his forests, Marcus captures a grizzled old hunting dog, untrained and feral. He hands it off to the kennel master to be tamed and trained. A hunting dog has a training period of 1 month, so it will take (1 x 4) 4 months for the grizzled old cur to be tamed, and then (1 x 2) 2 months for it to learn its first trick. Each subsequent trick will take (1/2 x 1 x 2) 1 month to learn. You can, in fact, teach an old dog new tricks, it just takes longer!

Normally, a monster can be taught a maximum of 2d4 different tricks (or 5 tricks +/- its INT modifier, if the optional **Ability Scores for Monsters** rules are being used). Some monsters are innately more or less trainable and have a **trainability modifier** applied to their maximum number of tricks. These are listed on the Taming and Training Monsters table. (The table shows that animals specifically bred for war are more alert and trainable than less well-bred specimens.) An animal trainer will learn the creature’s limit when he tames the creature.

EXAMPLE: An elephant has a trainability modifier of +3. Even the dumbest elephant can learn 5 tricks, the average elephant can learn 8 tricks, and a very smart elephant can learn 11 tricks. In contrast, a giant centipede has a trainability modifier of -3. Even the smartest giant centipede can learn 5 tricks at most, putting it on par with the dumbest of elephants. An average giant centipede can only learn 2 tricks, and a truly stupid giant centipede couldn’t learn any tricks at all.

### Animal Trainers

Taming and training monsters requires an animal trainer specialist or other character with the appropriate type of Animal Training proficiency. With one rank of Animal Training, the character can train domestic animals such as dogs, falcons, and horses. With two ranks, he can train wild animals such as bears and lions. With three ranks, he can train dire, giant or prehistoric animals such as cave bears or giant hawks. With four ranks, he can train monstrosities of bestial intelligence, such as griffons or owlbeasts, as well as vermin such as carrion horrors or giant black worms.

A single trainer can train and manage up to six creatures at once as a dedicated activity. However, if a trainer works one-on-one with a particular creature for its entire course of training (a process sometimes called **monster whispering**), the creature’s maximum number of tricks is increased by two. Once a creature is tamed and trained, a trainer can control up to one mount or warmount, 6 workbeasts, 6 droving creatures, or 20 guard creatures at once. The trainer gains a +1 bonus to reaction rolls when approaching tame but uncontrolled animals of any type he can train.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Trainer Type | Wage |
| Domestic animal (Dog, hawk, horse, etc.) | 25gp/month |
| Wild animal (Bear, cat, etc.) | 75gp/month |
| Dire, giant, or prehistoric animal (any) | 150gp/month |
| Monstrosity or vermin (any) | 250gp/month |

Animal trainers cost between 25gp/month and 250gp/month to hire. Those able to train wild animals, giant animals, or monsters increasingly more expensive to hire. The Animal Trainer Wages table shows the average cost to hire different types of trainers. If a creature is of gigantic size or larger, its trainers cost a minimum of 150gp/month.

In order to train mounts for combat (e.g., warhorses), a trainer must also be a marshal of the appropriate type. The character earns either his wages as an animal trainer or wages as a marshal, whichever is higher. In general, light cavalry marshals earn 60gp/month while heavy cavalry marshals earn 120gp/month. See *Domains at War: Campaigns* for more information on marshals.

Flying creatures trained as adults require monster whispering, e.g., one trainer per creature. (Certain other particularly willful monsters also require monster whispering.)

### Tricks

Tricks are tasks or activities that a monster has been trained to perform on command. Possible tricks include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following:

* **Attack:** The creature attacks apparent enemies. Its handler may point to a particular creature that he wishes the creature to attack, and it will comply if able.
* **Carry:** The creature allows its handler to ride on its back.
* **Come:** The creature comes to its handler, even if it normally would not do so.
* **Defend:** The creature defends its handler (or is ready to defend its master if no threat is present), even without any command being given. Alternatively, its master can command the creature to defend a specific other character.
* **Down:** The creature breaks off from combat or otherwise backs down. A creature that doesn’t know this trick continues to fight until it must flee (due to injury, a fear effect, or the like) or its opponent is defeated.
* **Fetch:** The creature goes and gets something. If its handler does not point out a specific item, the creature fetches some random object.
* **Guard:** The creature stays in place and prevents others from approaching.
* **Heel:** The creature follows its handler closely, even to places where it normally wouldn’t go.
* **Perform:** The creature performs a variety of simple tricks, such as sitting up, rolling over, roaring or barking, and so on.
* **Seek:** The creature moves into an area and looks around for anything that is obviously alive or animate.
* **Stay:** The creature stays in place, waiting for its handler to return. It does not challenge other creatures that come by, though it still defends itself if it needs to.
* **Track:** The creature tracks the scent presented to it.
* **Work:** The creature carries, pulls, or pushes more than its normal load.

A tamed and trained monster will perform its tricks for its trainer and for any additional **handlers** the trainer introduces to it. Handlers do not need to be proficient in the appropriate Animal Training proficiency, but if they are not they can only safely control one monster at a time. (Monsters trained to particular roles may be more easily handled, as described below).

### Roles

Rather than teaching a monster individual tricks, its trainer can train it for a particular **role**. Essentially, a monster’s role represents a preselected set of known tricks that fit into a common scheme, such as guarding, hunting, or working. Each role counts as one or more tricks. A monster can be trained for only one role, and only for roles for which it can learn the required number of tricks. If the creature is capable of learning additional tricks (above and beyond those included in its role), it may do so when training for its role is completed.

**Drovers (D):** Drovers are trained to bring livestock together into a herd and move the herd from place to place. A proficient character (e.g., one with the appropriate Animal Training proficiency) can safely control up to six droving creatures, and an unproficient character can control only one. Drover training is exceptionally demanding, and counts as **seven tricks**.

**Guards (G):** Guards are trained to attack designated targets and defend designated characters or locations. Guards will accompany their handlers when requested, but loyally stay in place when their handlers are not present. A proficient character can safely control up to 20 guard creatures. An unproficient character can safely control up to 6 guard creatures, if an animal trainer has taught him the appropriate commands. Guard training increases a creature’s morale score (ML) by 2, to a maximum of +2, but it is highly demanding, equivalent to learning **seven tricks** from an animal trainer. Many creatures lack the intelligence or temperament to be guards – these are usually trained as hunters instead. (Some races have an affinity with certain creatures, and can train them as guards more easily. See p. XX for more details.).

**Hunters (H):** Hunters are trained to accompany their handlers on hunts, where they will track and kill designated targets. Unlike guard creatures, hunters require constant monitoring and discipline to ensure they stay under control. Therefore, a proficient character can safely control only six hunter creatures, and an unproficient character can control only one. Hunter training counts as learning only **two tricks**, so most animals of a carnivorous nature can be trained as hunters even if they are not suitable as guards.

**Livestock (L):** Livestock is trained to be easily herded by a shepherd, sheepdog, or similar. A proficient character or drover animal can safely control any number of livestock, provided they are part of the same social group (pack, herd, etc.). An unproficient character can safely control only one livestock. Livestock will not accept riders, pull loads, or carry burdens, and in battle or other stressful situations will tend to react according to their natural instincts (fleeing if a prey animal, or attacking if a predator). Domesticated herd animals can serve as livestock without taming or training. Otherwise, livestock training counts as learning **one trick**.

**Mounts (M):** Mounts are trained to carry a rider on their back and accept his directions. Mounts will not wear barding, and will not charge into melee unless facing natural predators. They will not attack with their natural weapons while carrying a rider. A proficient character (one with Adventuring, Animal Training, Beast Friendship, or Riding proficiency) can safely control a ridden mount outside of battle. If the character has Riding proficiency, he can control a ridden mount in battle; and outside of battle, he can control up to six mounts, one ridden and the others ponied on lead ropes. An unproficient character can safely control a mount on a lead rope, but cannot ride one without grave risk to himself (save versus Paralysis each round or fall off). Mount training counts as **five tricks**, so when dealing with less-intelligent beasts, suitable specimens might be rare and expensive. Note that even sapient creatures which are to carry riders must be trained as mounts, because the subtleties of communication between rider and mount, and of movement while laden with a rider, do not come naturally. A flying creature cannot be trained as a mount until it reaches adolescent age.

**War Mounts (WM):** War mounts are trained to carry a rider into battle and accept his directions despite the chaos around it. War mounts will wear barding, and will charge into melee, even if not naturally willing to do so. In melee, war mounts will attack their masters’ targets using their natural weapons. War mounts are subject to the same limits on control as mounts (see above). As with guard training, war mount training increases a creature’s morale score by 2, to a maximum of +2, and war mounts without riders can function as guard creatures. Training as a war mount is even more demanding than guard or mount training, counting as **eight tricks**. Very few animals have the intelligence and temperament to serve as war mounts, so they tend to be very expensive. Sapient creatures which are to carry troops into battle must receive war mount training. Unlike creatures of animal intelligence, their morale score is not increased by war mount training, however. A flying creature cannot be trained as a war mount until it reaches adolescent age.

**Work Beast (WB):** Work beasts are trained to pull heavy loads or carry burdens. Work beasts are not trained to accept a rider, and in battle or other stressful situations will tend to react according to their natural instincts (fleeing if a prey animal, or attacking if a predator). Teaching an animal to be a work beast counts as **two tricks**. A proficient character can safely control six work beasts, and an unproficient character can control only one.

### Magic and Monster Training

When available, magic can be a powerful aid to monster training.

###### Animal Friendship

Whenever elves build fastnesses, all ordinary animals within 5 miles of the stronghold become kind and helpful to the elves. Such animals are always considered tame for the purposes of training by the elves who reside in the fastness.

###### Beast Friendship/Friend of Birds and Beasts

All animal henchman recruited with Beast Friendship are automatically considered tame towards the character for the purposes of training. Animal henchmen can be trained by the character, via monster whispering, for any role for which they possess sufficient intelligence (tricks); the character does not have to separately possess Animal Training to train his animal henchman. Because of his innate understanding of the language of beasts, a character with Beast Friendship always counts as proficient for purposes of handling trained animals in their roles.

###### Bewitch

The various **bewitch** spells are a great boon to animal trainers. As soon as a creature is **bewitched** it is immediately considered tame for the purposes of training by the spellcaster. An appropriate Animal Training proficiency is still required to train a **bewitched** creature, but such training will occur at child rates, even if the creature is already an adolescent or older. However, if the **bewitchment’s** duration ever expires (whether from **dispel** or a successful saving throw), the creature will revert to being wild until it is **bewitched** again. As always, a creature’s behavior when the spell ends will depend on how it was treated while **bewitched**.

EXAMPLE: Llewyn, an elven animal trainer with Animal Training (bears), has captured an adult grizzly bear. He decides to train it as a hunter (2 tricks). Grizzly bears have a base training time of 3 months. Therefore, it will take Llewyn (1 x 3 x 6) 18 months to tame the adult bear, and another (1 x 3 x 2) + (1 x 3 x 2 x ½) 9 months train it, 27 months total. Although ageless, Llewyn is quite impatient, so he casts *bewitch beast*on the bear instead. It is immediately tamed, and he can now train it as if it were a child. Now it will take only (1 x 3) + (1 x ½ x 3) 4.5 months to train it! The downside, however, is that Llewyn will lose control of his bear if the bewitch ever expires.

###### Speak with Beasts

A character under the effects of *speak with beasts*always counts as proficient for the purposes of handling trained animals in their roles. He may handle a friendly but untrained animal in any role it is capable of fulfilling as if it were trained for the role. The character does not count as proficient in this case (unless he actually does possess the appropriate proficiency). He automatically counts as monster whispering when training animals he can speak with.

EXAMPLE: Llewyn has stumbled upon an enormous stash of ivory hidden in a jungle temple. After bagging the ivory, Llewyn discovers it weighs 100 stone, well more than he can carry. Llewyn casts *bewitch beast*on a nearby rhinoceros (rendering it friendly), then *speak with beasts*.While the spells last, Llewyn can handle the rhinoceros as if he were an unproficient handler of a trained workbeast. This allows him to benefit from its 100-stone carrying capacity.

### Encounters with Tamed Monsters

Normally, a tamed and trained monster is introduced to a new handler by a character that already controls it. Sometimes this process breaks down – a trainer might be killed or quit before control is handed over, or a monster might be encountered “off the leash.”

To determine how a tame but uncontrolled monster responds, make a reaction roll. Apply a +2 bonus if the character approaching it has the appropriate Animal Training proficiency. (Remember that characters with Beast Friendship or under the effects of *speak with beasts*always count as proficient for the purposes of handling trained animals*.*) If the reaction roll is 9 or higher, the character immediately becomes the animal’s handler.

### Monster Taming and Training by Other Races

Mankind is not the only race to tame and train beasts to serve it. Dwarves, elves, giants, and beastmen of various sorts all rely on trained monsters. Just as each race has its own distinct physical and mental characteristics, so too does each race have certain monsters with which it has affinity, or lacks affinity, for training.

The Monster Taming and Training by Race table lists the races and the creatures they have an affinity, or lack of an affinity, with. Feel free to add or subtract races and affinities to reflect your campaign setting.

When a trainer has an affinity with a monster he is training, training it as a guard or war mount only counts as teaching it two tricks. This reflects the mutual bond that forms between the trainer and trainee.

EXAMPLE: Kurk has just tamed a brown bear cub that he wants to train as a guard. He rolls 2d4 to see how many tricks the cub can learn, and scores a 5. A brown bear has a trainability modifier of +1, meaning the cub can only learn (5+1) 6 tricks. Guard training counts as seven tricks, so most trainers would not be able to train the cub. However, Kurk is a dwarf, so he has an affinity with brown bears. That means training the cub to be a guard will only count as teaching it two tricks. Kurk’s affinity for brown bears will also speed up the training time. Grizzly bears have a training period of 3 months, so, normally, training a tamed cub to be a guard would take [(3 months x 1 trick) + (3 months x 6/2 tricks)] 12 months. But Kurk will be able to train the cub to be a guard in [(3 months x 1 trick) + (3 months x ½ tricks)] 4.5 months.

When a trainer has no affinity with a monster he is training, its base training period is doubled for all purposes. The morale of a trained monster is reduced by 2 points while handled by a creature with no affinity with it. Mounts will not accept riders who have no affinity for them (treat the rider as unproficient if he attempts to ride anyway). War mounts will accept riders who have no affinity for them, but function only as (non-war) mounts when doing so.

EXAMPLE: Mulik, an orc chieftain, captures a baby mastiff (war dog) during a caravan raid. Mulik decides he would like to tame and train the puppy to be a guard dog. Normally it would take [(1 month) + (1 month x 1 trick) + (1 month x 6/2 tricks)] 5 months to tame and train the puppy, but it will take Mulik 10 months because orcs have no affinity with dogs. A war dog, when trained as a guard, normally has a morale score of +2, but Mulik’s war dog only has a morale score of 0. The puppy grows up into a mangy cur that has little love for its brutish master.

### Monster Taming and Training Characteristics

###### Diminutive

The name given to the creature’s young, e.g., pup for dire wolf or maggot for giant fly.

###### Weight

The average weight of the creature when full grown, in lbs. Adolescents weigh 75% of adult weight. Children weigh 25% to 75% of adult weight (50% on average). Babies weigh 5% to 25% of adult weight (15% on average). A clutch of eggs weigh 2.5% of adult weight in total (i.e. creatures that lay more eggs lay smaller eggs).

###### Size Category

The relative size of the creature – man-size (M), large (L), huge (H), gigantic (G), or colossal (C). A creature’s size category is determined by its length or height and its weight, as shown on the table below. If a creature’s height and weight place it in two different categories, weight is generally determinative. Flying creatures with particularly large wing spans on light frames are sometimes placed in one size category larger than their weight would indicate.

|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | **Man-Sized** | **Large** | **Huge** | **Gigantic** | **Colossal** |
| **Length/Height** | Less than 8’ long/tall | 8’ to 12’ long/tall | 12’ to 20’ long/tall | 20’ to 32’ long/tall | 32’ or more long/tall |
| **Weight** | Up to 400 lbs | 401 to 2,000 lbs | 2,001 to 8,000 lbs | 8,001 to 32,000 lbs | More than 32,000 lbs |

###### Normal Load

Some creatures are valued primarily for their ability to carry equipment, supplies, or treasure. The figure listed is the **normal load** the creature can carry in stone. Most creatures can carry a maximum of twice their normal load. When carrying more than their normal load, their speed is reduced to half.

EXAMPLE: A giant tiger beetle can carry its normal load of 250 stone at its full speed of 150’ per turn. It can carry up to 500 stone at 75’ per turn.

Humanoids can endure heavier loads relative to their own size. Humanoids may carry their normal load at full movement. They may carry up to half again of their normal load at three-quarters movement. They may carry up to twice their normal load at half movement. They may carry up to four times their normal load at one-quarter movement.

EXAMPLE: A cyclops can carry 90 stone at its full speed of 90’ per turn. It can carry up to 135 stone at 67’ per turn. It can carry up to 180 stone at 45’ per turn. It can carry up to 360 stone at 22’ per turn.

###### Lifespan

Lifespan indicates the ages at which a creature enters each age category, in the order Baby/Juvenile/Adolescent/Adult/Middle Aged/Old/Ancient/Maximum. All creatures enter the baby category at age 0, but the baby categories of oviparous creatures are designated with an E instead of 0 to indicate that the creature begins its life as an egg. Creatures with short lifespans tend to be more valuable as babies and juveniles, while creatures with long lifespans tend to be more valuable as adults.

EXAMPLE: A griffin’s lifespan is designated E/0.25/0.5/3.3/22/33/44/55. A griffin begins as an egg when born; at 3 months (0.25 years) old it hatches into a child; at 6 months (0.5 years) it becomes an adolescent; at 3.3 years it becomes an adult; at 22 years it becomes middle aged; at 33 years it becomes old; at 44 years it becomes ancient; and at 55 years it reaches its maximum lifespan.

###### Role

Role indicates the type of training the creature would typically receive, including Drover (D), Guard (G), Hunter (H), livestock (L), mount (M), war mount (WM), or work beast (WB). Training is not applicable (N/A) to sapient creatures, unless they are typically used as mounts.

###### Trained Value

This column shows the typical market price in gold pieces at which a trained and tamed adolescent or adult creature could be bought or sold. Note that trained value varies by training. Guards and war mounts, being rare specimens, often command a premium.

In most cases, trained creatures sell for much more than untrained creatures. However, some creatures’ trained value will simply be equal to their untrained adult value. This occurs when the creature is very difficult to manage, such that the cost of the creature handlers required to field the creatures simply does not justify training or using them. Such creature are essentially valuable only for their monster parts (p. XX – XX).

Animals, constructs, oozes, vermin, and other creatures of less than sapient intelligence can be bought and sold as property in most realms. Creatures of sapient intelligence are generally only be bought and sold as property (slaves) in chaotic realms where slavery is permitted. Some Lawful realms permit criminals or prisoners of war to be sold into indentured servitude until they pay off their debt to society.

Trained value also determines the wage that a creature can command as a mercenary, or that a controller can charge for controlling the creature on behalf of an employer. The wage equals the trained value/33. If the creature’s weekly supply cost is more than 0.5gp per month, reduce its wage by 4 x excess supply cost.

EXAMPLE: A demonic attercop is a sapient monstrosity with a trained value of 93,500gp and a weekly supply cost of 48gp per month. A dark lord that wishes to hire a demonic attercop to undertake his evil schemes would have to pay (93,500 / 33) – (48 x 4) = 2,641gp per month.

**Limits of Availability:** For all transactions, apply the limits of the Equipment Availability by Market Class table. You can impose further limits depending on your setting. Just because a price is listed doesn’t mean the monster is available in every market everywhere.

**Attributes:** Monsters with high attributes are worth more. Each attribute of 13-15 adds 25% to the monster’s cost. Each attribute of 16-17 adds 100% to the monster’s cost. Each attribute of 18 adds 400% to the monster’s cost.

EXAMPLE: Bucephalus is a medium warhorse fit for a world conqueror, with STR 18, INT 18, WIS 18, DEX 18, CON 18, and CHA 18. A typical medium warhorse costs 250gp. Bucephalus costs 250gp + (400% x 250gp) + (400% x 250gp) + (400% x 250gp) + (400% x 250gp) + (400% x 250gp) + (400% x 250gp) = 6,250gp. The historical Bucephalus cost 13 silver talents, which equates to 7,800gp, so ACKS is giving Alexander the Great a discount.

Monsters with low attributes are worth less. Reduce the monster’s price by 15% for each ability score of 3, 10% for each ability score of 4-5, and 5% for each ability score of 6-8.

EXAMPLE: Encephalitus is a medium warhorse fit for not much at all, with STR 3, INT 3, WIS 3, DEX 3, CON 3, and CHA 3. A typical medium warhorse costs 250gp. Encephalitus costs 250gp – [6 x (15% x 250gp)], or 25gp.

###### Adult/Juvenile/Baby Value

This column shows the typical market price in gold pieces at which an untamed, untrained creature of that age could be bought or sold. Adolescent creatures are priced as adults. Eggs are priced as babies.

Untrained adults are usually worth much less than trained adults. Untrained sapient adults are essentially worthless except as slave labor or monster parts. Untrained adults of less-than-sapient intelligence can sometimes be valuable if they are readily trained and quite powerful.

Juveniles and babies usually are worth more than untrained adults, but less than trained adults. Creatures that mature quickly are generally most valuable as juveniles or babies. At that age, they can be readily trained and then quickly put into service, owing to their short age-to-maturity. Creatures that mature slowly and/or are expensive to maintain are often captured as adults. The additional time and cost of training an adult (or of magically bewitching it) can be worthwhile if it will take a juvenile creature years to mature, during which it must be fed and cared for. Elephants, which take years to mature, were captured and trained as adults for this reason in our real world.

Adult, juvenile, and baby value can be adjusted by high and low ability scores, as above. Availability is limited by market and setting, as with trained monsters.

Note that dragons of each age category are purchased as adult creatures. There is no such thing as a “baby venerable dragon”; it’s a dragon spawn.

###### Supply Cost

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Size | Herbivore/Omnivore | Carnivore |
| Small or Man-Sized | 0.5 | 2 |
| Large | 4 | 16 |
| Huge | 12 | 48 |
| Gigantic | 48 | 192 |
| Colossal | 240 | 960 |

The cost per week in gold pieces to supply an adult creature with adequate provisions. Carnivorous creatures cost more to supply than herbivorous ones, and big creatures cost more to supply than small ones, as shown on the adjoining table. Where creatures have been assigned a size category larger than their weight would otherwise indicate (due to, e.g. long frame, wings, etc.) supply cost is halved.

EXAMPLE: With its 200’ wingspan, a giant roc is a colossal carnivore. However, based on its weight (15,000 lbs), it is merely gigantic. Therefore it is assigned a supply cost of 480gp, one-half that of a colossal carnivore by weight.

Eggs, herbivorous creatures grazing on a pasture, and carnivorous creatures hunting on a range need not be supplied. Baby, juvenile, and adolescent creatures require less food; multiply the supply cost by the creature’s age as a percentage of its age upon entering adulthood. Round to the nearest 0.5gp. (This usually matters only if the adventurers have set up a program of monster breeding.)

EXAMPLE: An adult griffin has a supply cost of 16gp per week. A griffin enters adulthood at 3.3 years old. Therefore a 1-year-old griffin has a supply cost of (1/3.3) x (16) = 4.84gp per week, rounded to 5gp per week.

Any time small or man-sized creatures are mounted on creatures of large size or more, just use mount’s supply cost rather than the total. This allows a unit of 60 ogres and a unit of 60 cavalry to maintain the same supply cost (4gp each) without fractional gp values.

###### Training Period

The number of months it takes to tame the creature, or teach the creature its first trick. Training period is determined by a creature’s sapience and temperament. If the value listed is “-“, then the creature cannot be trained.

###### Trainability Modifier (TM)

A modifier applied to the number of tricks the creature can learn, representing differences due to the species’ sapience and temperament. If the modifier listed is “S”, then the creature is sapient. Sapient creatures do not need to be trained unless they want to serve as mounts or war mounts, and are not limited to a number of tricks. If the value listed is “+3”, then the creature is semi-sapient. If the value listed is “-“, then the creature is mindless or otherwise cannot be trained.

## Monster Parts (Mundane)

Several entries on Merchandise tables and Special Treasure tables describe the gp value of meats, hides, furs, and other monster parts. The rules in this section explain how monsters slain in the course of play can be harvested for parts to sell or use. The subsequent section details using monster parts as special components in magic research (see ***ACKS II RR***, p. XX).

Adventurers can identify the value of a monster’s parts with a Naturalism proficiency throw or a Loremastery throw. Adventurers will require certain proficiencies to be able to efficiently harvest a monster’s parts for sale or use; these are noted in each section.

Once harvested, monster parts may be sold at their market value, subject to the limitations of Equipment Availability in Markets (***ACKS II RR****,* p. 39). Alternatively, monster parts may be sold as trade goods following the rules for Mercantile Ventures (***ACKS II RR****,* p. 142). Adventurers may gain XP from mercantile ventures selling monster parts. Treat the base market value of the monster parts as their cost of the goods sold for the purposes of calculating their mercantile income.

#### Antlers, Horns, and Tusks

Some monsters have antlers, horns, or tusks with decorative, instrumental, or medicinal value (hereafter just called horns, for simplicity). Common animal horns are worth 10gp per stone of weight, while exotic horns are worth 40gp – 100gp per stone of encumbrance.

The Antler, Horn, and Tusk table catalogs which monsters have notably valuable antlers, horns, and tusks, along with their respective number, weights, and values. Since the size and stature of a creature’s horns can vary widely based on its age, health, and physical condition, the table provides a set of random ranges as well as average values. Only male mammals should have antlers.

EXAMPLE: The Judge is building a lair with an old dragon. The Judge decides to roll randomly for the value of the dragon’s horns. The roll of 1d10x50 yields a result of 450gp for the left horn and 500gp for the right horn, 950gp total. Since an old dragon typically has horns worth around 560gp, this is clearly a large, healthy specimen with a proud crown.

Horns can be sold or used as raw materials by a weaponsmith. Horns can also be used as precious materials when enchanting magical weapons.

Horns must be captured intact or they will be worthless. Horns will be intact provided the monster was not damaged with an area-of-effect attack. A character equipped with an axe or other cutting tool can remove a dead or helpless monster’s horns in one round per stone of encumbrance. Before a horn can be sold, it must be properly cleansed, trimmed, and polished. Properly preparing a horn requires Animal Husbandry or Trapping proficiency, and requires 1 turn (10 rounds) per stone encumbrance.

Monsters in the baby, juvenile, and adolescent age categories never have antlers, horns, or tusks.

EXAMPLE: The Zaharan ruinguard Moruvai has slain a unicorn with a 1,500gp horn (1 3/6 stone). It takes him (6 x 9/6) 9 rounds of hacking with his axe to cleave off the precious horn. He departs the site of his atrocity before any do-gooders can punish him. Cleaning, trimming, and polishing the horn will take (60 x 9/6) 90 more rounds (15 minutes), but this he can do later in the comfort of his evil lair.

#### Claws, Fangs, Stingers, Tails, and Talons

While most claws, fangs, stingers, tails, and talons are of little interest, a few monsters have particularly fierce natural weapons. These are often prized as museum pieces, trophies, or fetishes.

A prized natural weapon is worth a number of gp equal to the maximum damage it can deal. For exceptional monsters with STR of 13 or more, include the damage bonus from high STR into the weapons’ damage when calculating its value. Natural weapons have an encumbrance of 1/6 stone per 10gp.

###### Claws/Talons

Claws/talons are prized if the monster’s claw/talon attack can:

* break bone, eviscerate, or maim targets; or
* grab and carry man-sized or larger targets

###### Fangs

Fangs are prized if the monster’s bite attack can:

* break bones, eviscerate, or maim targets
* inject acid or poison; or
* swallow man-sized or larger targets

For game purposes “fangs” collectively encompasses all of the creature’s mouthparts, such as beaks, cuspids, incisors, mandibles, maxillae, molars, etc. Note that particularly impressive teeth are handled as tusks under Antlers, Horns, and Tusks, above.

###### Stinger

Stingers are prized if the monster’s sting attack can inject acid or poison into a target.

#### Feathers and Plumage

Some monsters and animals may have large, colorful feathers that command a high value – typically 1gp to 6gp in value each, with an encumbrance of 1 stone per 25 feathers. Feathers of some particularly impressive monsters can be even larger and more valuable. The feathers of a giant roc can be up to 20’ long and worth 120gp each!

Feathers can be sold or used as raw materials by a fletcher. Feathers can also be used to pay the material cost of magical arrows or cloaks.

As with fur pelts, feathers must be captured intact to maintain their value. Feathers will be intact provided the monster was not damaged with an area-of-effect attack. Damaged feathers are worthless. Plucking feathers takes 1 turn per stone of feathers.

The Feathers and Plumage table catalogs which monsters have valuable feathers. Although feathered creatures have anywhere from 1,000 to 25,000 feathers, only a small percentage have notable market value: the 10 primary and 14 secondary flight feathers of each wing, and the 12 flight feathers of the tail (60 total). Crossbreeds have fewer feathers, depending on their body form. Some feathers may be damaged by age, weather, illness, or battle, so the table provides a set of random ranges as well as typical value for a monster’s plumage.

Baby, juvenile, and adolescent monsters have feathers worth 25%, 50%, and 75% of the value of an adult monster.

#### Pelts and Meats

Adventurers may skin, flesh, and butcher slain monsters in order to harvest their pelts and meat. The time required for this labor, and the weight and value of the resulting product, is based on the monster’s weight, as shown on the Skinning, Fleshing, and Butchering table, below. Adventurers must have one of the following proficiencies in order to properly prepare animal products: Animal Husbandry, Labor (butchery), Labor (farming), or Trapping. If not, the time required for each process is doubled, and the amount yielded is halved. If desired, adventurers may collaborate in butchering monsters, dividing its weight amongst themselves. All participating characters must have the appropriate craftsman’s tools (even if they are unproficient).

|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Process** | **Time Required (turns)** | **Product** | **Amount Yielded (st)** | **Value (gp)** |
| Skinning and Fleshing | Monster Weight in lbs. / 10 | Pelt | 0.00265 x Monster Weight in lbs. | 1 x Pelt Encumbrance |
| Butchering | Monster Weight in lbs. / 5 | Meat | 0.0265 x Monster Weight in lbs. | 0.3 x Meat Encumbrance |

EXAMPLE: Sorcha, a ranger with Trapping proficiency, kills a 600-pound dire wolf. It will take her (600/10) 60 turns to skin the animal, or about 10 hours. The dire wolf’s pelt will weigh (0.00265 x 600) 1.59 stone and be worth (1 x 1.59) 1.59gp. She can then butcher the dire wolf’s carcass, which will take her (600/5) 120 turns, about 20 hours. Butchering the dire wolf yields (0.0265 x 600) 15.9 stone of wolf meat, worth (0.3 x 15.9) 4.8gp. Her total profit on 30 hours of labor is 6.39gp. If Sorcha did not have Trapping proficiency, these tasks would take twice as long and yield half the value.

Adventurers can hire laborers at a rate of 1sp per 8 hours to skin, flesh, and butcher their kills for them. The labor cost will work out to 0.000625gp x Monster Weight, and the net profit for the adventurers will work out to 0.01gp x Monster Weight.

EXAMPLE: Sorcha hires a laborer to skin, flesh, and butcher the slain dire wolf. Since the wolf weighs 600 lbs, the laborer charges (600 x .000625) 0.38gp. That is, her laborer charges 1sp every 8 hours; 30 hours of his labor costs (1sp/8 hours x 30 hours) 3.8sp or 0.38gp. Sorcha’s net profit is (6.39gp – 0.38gp) or 6.01gp. Sorcha has tediously determined that she is, indeed, earning 0.1gp per pound of monster.

Decimal stone weights should be converted to items for encumbrance purposes by rounding to the nearest 1/6.

#### Rugs, Capes, Coats, and Trophies

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Good** | **Value (gp)** | **Enc. (st)** | **# of Pelts Required** |
| Rug | 2d4 x Pelt Value | Pelt Weight(s) | 1 / Pelt Weight (rounded up) |
| Cape | 4d6 x Pelt Value | 1 | 2 / Pelt Weight (rounded up) |
| Coat | 1d6 x 10 x Pelt Value | 1 | 3 / Pelt Weight (rounded up) |
| Trophy | 3d4 x Pelt Value | Pelt Weight x 7 | 1 |

Pelts can be cut and sewn into rugs, capes, and coats, or stuffed and mounted as trophies. The value and encumbrance of rugs, capes, coats, and trophies is based on the pelt used. Sewing or stuffing is a construction project with a labor cost equal to the final value less the value of the pelts used (see ***ACKS II RR****,* XX).

EXAMPLE: Sorcha’s dire wolf pelt weighs 1.6 stone and is worth 159cp. She could have it made into a rug worth 318cp to 1,272cp and weighing 1.6 stone; or stuffed as a trophy mount worth 477cp to 1,908cp and weighing 11.2st. She would need 2 pelts to make a cape and 3 to make a coat. She hires a master furrier to sew the pelt into a rug worth 1,159cp. The furrier’s construction rate is 1gp per day, equaling 100cp per day. It takes the furrier [1,159cp – 159cp) / 100cp per day] 10 days.

| Hyena, Giant | 2 5/6 | 105 | Yali | 2 2/6 | 135 |

**Fur Pelts:** Monster pelts with particularly rare, durable, warm, or striking fur are more valuable than the common pelts above. In general, such **fur pelts** are worth 5gp per stone of encumbrance or more. Particularly rare fur pelts are worth as much as 100gp per stone of encumbrance.

The Foe Fur table catalogs which monsters have notably valuable pelts, along with their respective values and encumbrance.

Adventurers who want a fur pelt must take great care when killing the monster. A monster’s carcass will yield an intact fur pelt only if:

* The monster was slain with just one attack; or
* The monster was slain entirely with blunt weapons; or
* The monster was slain by cold, death magic, electricity, or poison, and lost less than half its hit points to other attacks.

Damaged fur pelts are worth just 1gp per stone. Like normal pelts, fur pelts must be skinned and fleshed before they can be sold. Fur pelts can be used to make valuable rugs, capes, coats, and trophies.

EXAMPLE: If Sorcha had slain the dire wolf entirely with blunt weapons, its pelt would have been worth 50gp instead of 1.59gp.

###### Armored Hides

Some monster pelts are so thick, durable, or hard that they can be used to forge armor. These **armored hides** can be sold or used as raw materials by an armorer. (Raw materials reduce the labor cost of a construction project by their value, to a maximum 25% of the total cost of the construction project; see *D@W: Campaigns,* p. 51). Armored hides can be used to pay material costs when enchanting magical armor and shields.

The Monster Armored Hide table catalogs which monsters have armored hides, along with their respective values and encumbrance. Like all pelts, armored hides must be skinned and fleshed (see p. XX).

As with fur pelts, armored hides must be captured intact to maintain their value. A monster’s armored hide will only be intact if:

* The monster was slain with just one attack; or
* The monster was slain by cold, death magic, electricity, or poison and lost half its hit points or less to other attacks.

Damaged armored pelts are worth just 1gp per stone. Like all pelts, armored hides must be skinned and fleshed (see p. XX).

###### Baby, Juvenile, and Adolescent Pelts and Meats

Cruel-hearted adventurers might club baby seals. Unless otherwise noted, baby, juvenile, and adolescent monsters have pelts and meat worth 25%, 50%, and 75% of the value of an adult monster.

###### Extraordinary Pelts

Monsters with high STR, CON, or CHA will have more valuable pelts than normal creatures of their type. If STR, CON, or CHA are 13-15, add 25% to the value of the monster’s pelt. If STR, CON, or CHA are 16-17, add 100% to the value. If STR, CON, or CHA are 18, add 400% to the value. The bonus from ability scores stacks.

EXAMPLE: The adventurers have slain a particularly large and impressive mammoth (STR 16, CHA 14). A normal mammoth’s hide is worth 350gp. This mammoth’s hide is worth 350gp + (25% x 350gp) + (100% x 350gp), or 787gp.

Monsters with low STR, CON, or CHA will have less valuable pelts. If STR, CON, or CHA are 3, reduce the value of the monster’s pelt by 75%. If STR, CON, or CHA are 4-5, reduce the value by 50%. If STR, CON, or CHA are 6-8, reduce the value by 25%. The penalty from ability scores stacks. If the penalty reduces the value to 0 or less, the pelt is simply worthless.

#### Venoms

Characters with Naturalism proficiency can identify venomous monsters and distinguish their different poisons with a successful proficiency throw of 11+. Extracting venom from a slain monster requires 1 hour of ancillary activity and a successful Animal Husbandry proficiency throw of 18+. The character gains a +4 bonus to the throw per additional rank of Animal Husbandry. If the throw fails, the character can try again. If the character’s proficiency throw to extract venom is an unmodified 1, he has accidentally gotten scratched by a fang or stinger. The character must immediately save versus Poison, as if hit by the monster.

Once extracted, monster venoms can be applied to weapons. Each monster yields one dose of its venom. A dose is enough venom to treat twenty missiles (arrows, bolts, or darts) or one melee weapon. Note that venoms applied to missiles and melee weapons are not as effective as they are when coming from the monster itself. Venomous monsters penetrate their prey’s skin with hollow fangs or tubular stingers, then use muscles attached to their venom reservoirs to forcibly squirt venom deep within the target’s body tissue. In comparison, a sword or arrow is simply a less effective mechanism for delivering poison.

The Monster Venoms table shows the market cost, onset time, save modifier, and effects of monster venoms when applied to missiles and melee weapons. An onset time of instant means the poison takes effect at the end of the attacker’s initiative. An onset time of “one round” means the poison takes effect at the end of the round following the target’s next initiative (e.g. the target gets to act once before the poison affects him).

Note that baby and juvenile monsters do not have sufficient venom to extract. Adolescent monsters have a full dose of venom.

## Monster Parts (Special)

When a monster dies, a residue of its soul will linger in some its body parts, such as organs and bodily fluids. These body parts are known as **special components** and can be tapped by spellcasters to power the creation of magic items or the casting of ritual spells. Powerful mages and clerics often send parties of adventurers on quests to slay certain monsters and return with the monsters’ special components.

#### Identifying Special Components

Each species of monster has one or more body parts that typically house its spiritual residue after its death. Adventurers with Alchemy, Collegiate Wizardry, Magical Engineering, or Naturalism proficiency can identify which part(s) of a monster are typically special components. A proficiency throw of 14+ is required; the target value is reduced by 4 for each additional proficiency rank the character possesses in any of the appropriate proficiencies, to a minimum of 2+. If the throw fails, the adventurer is ignorant of the typical special component for that species. Adventurers with Loremastery can use it in addition to or in lieu of these proficiencies at the character’s unmodified target value.

EXAMPLE: The great sage Phimon has the following proficiencies: Alchemy 2, Collegiate Wizardry, and Magical Engineering. He therefore has three additional ranks in the proficiencies used to identify special components. He can identify which parts of a monster are usually special component on a proficiency throw of 2+.

Sometimes a monster’s spiritual residue might reside in an unusual organ or fluid due to the manner of the creature’s death, the alignment of the spheres, or other arcane factors. Roll 1d20; on a natural 20, the creature has an unusual special component or components of your choice.

Spellcasters with the ability to discern magic (through a proficiency, class power, or spell) can determine the exact special component(s) of a particularslain monster. Such spellcasters can also inspect monster parts presented to them to assess whether they are, indeed, special components. The presence of spiritual residue is subtle, so the determination takes one turn and requires a magic research throw. If the throw fails, the spellcaster has not been able to glean any information. The spellcaster can try again every turn, if desired, for as long as he can discern magic.

EXAMPLE: One of Moruvai’s minions presents him with the stomach of a polar bear, claiming it is rich with residual energies. Moruvai casts discern magic and inspects the hide for one turn (10 minutes). His magic research throw succeeds, and the ruinguard learns that the stomach has no value as a special component whatsoever. Was his minion negligent in storing the stomach, or was this attempted deceit? Moruvai has ways of making him talk…

| Internal organ (heart, kidney, etc.) | *disintegration*; poison |
| Remnant (ectoplasm, slag, residue, etc.) | *disintegration* |

Special components can only be harvested if they are captured intact. Components will be intact provided the monster was not damaged by an effect that ruins that type of component, as shown on the accompanying table.

###### Permanent Wounds and Harvesting (Optional Rule)

Roll on the Mortal Wounds table when a monster is slain to assess whether the monster’s special components are intact. Select the Timing modifier based on when the adventurers harvest the monster’s component (typically after the fight). Apply the treatment modifier if the adventurer harvesting the component has the prerequisite proficiency to harvest it (see below). If the special component is damaged or destroyed by a permanent wound, it cannot be harvested. An “instant kill” result (0 or less on the d20) means that all the monster’s special components were destroyed.

EXAMPLE: The Claws of the Lioness are hunting giant hawks in order to harvest their eyes*.* They have just reduced a giant hawk to -8 hp from its maximum of 12 hp. As soon as the fight ends, a hireling with Animal Husbandry approaches the fallen hawk to harvest its eyes. The Judge rolls on the appropriate Mortal Wounds table for the giant hawk. He rolls a 10 on 1d20 and a 2 on 1d6. The d20 modifier is -5 (negative hp value of ½ max or more), +2 (Animal Husbandry), -3 (immediately after the fight), for -6 total, reducing the d20 roll to 4.

Cross-referencing 4 and 2 on the Mortal Wounds table, the Judge sees that the giant hawk has been blinded, so its eyes cannot be harvested. Its other special component (flight feathers) are intact and can still be harvested, however. If the modified d20 roll had been 0 or less, none of the hawk’s components would be intact.

###### Harvesting with Proficiencies

Appendages, external organs, and remnants can be harvested by any adventurer. It requires one turn and no special proficiency to do so.

Bones, coverings, internal organs, and more exotic special components can only be harvested by characters with the prerequisite proficiencies shown on the adjoining table. Characters must have the appropriate craftsman’s tools for the proficiency used and spend one turn per 100gp value of the component (minimum one turn).

EXAMPLE: Yrsa has slain a harpy and wishes to harvest its vocal cords (65gp value). Vocal cords are an internal organ, so there is a proficiency prerequisite. Harpies are monstrosities, so Yrsa must have a combination of three ranks in Animal Husbandry or Healing proficiency to perform the delicate extraction. Yrsa has three ranks of Healing proficiency, so she qualifies. It takes her one turn to harvest the vocal cords.

#### Storing Special Components

Special components are fragile, as the residual energies are prone to dissolving once disturbed. If a corpse is moved before its special components are extracted, its special components have a cumulative 10% chance per 100’ the corpse is moved of losing their value. Once a special component has been extracted, it will lose its value in one turn unless placed inside a special alchemical jar known as a **metamphora**. Special components inside metamphora can be moved and stored safely. Note that special components generally weigh very little; the encumbrance from special components is from the metamphora needed to preserve them.

**Metamphora:** Designed to store special components, metamphora are ceramic jars inscribed with alchemical sigils and stoppered with copper seals. Metamphora come in an array of different sizes and shapes, as more valuable special components require sturdier, stronger metamphora to prevent leakage. Metamphora cost 5gp and weigh 1 stone for every 60gp of value they store.

#### Value and Encumbrance of Special Components

The Monster Special Components tables on the following pages catalog the special components of frequently-hunted monsters, along with each entry’s associated encumbrance and value, and the suggested spell effects the special components might correlate with. Unlisted monsters are left to your discretion.

With rare exceptions, a monster’s special components have an aggregate gp value equal to the monster’s XP value. The encumbrance of special components is assumed to be equal to that of the metamphora required to transport them, 1 stone per 60gp value.

Some entries represent groups of monsters of varying Hit Dice or abilities. The spell effects associated with such entries might be subjected to restrictions that limit them to particular sub-sets of the entry. Any such restrictions are called out with brackets.

EXAMPLE: The entry “animals, ordinary” covers all ordinary animals – bears, dogs, horses, etc. The associated spell effects for “animals, ordinary” are “*bewitch beast* [2HD+], *summon animal* [4 HD+]*,* and *predict weather.”* The restriction “[2 HD+]” means that an ordinary animal’s special component is only associated with *bewitch beast* if the animal has at least 2 HD or more.

###### Default Effects

Each monster type (animal, beastman, etc.) has one or more default spell effects associated with it. Each and every special component harvested from a monster can be used for magical research relating to the default spell effects for its type.

###### Great-Souled Creatures

Lawful monsters with innate divine magic (such as herald angels, lammasu, or unicorns) are exceptionally valuable sources of power. Their special components are worth 10 times their XP value. Killing such a great-souled creature is, of course, a horribly Chaotic act.

###### Ordinary Animals

Most animals are so embedded in the cycle of life that their spiritual residue disperses almost immediately. They cannot be harvested for special components. Only animals of unusual size, stature, or other characteristics can be harvested. In game terms, this includes dire animals, giant animals, and prehistoric animals, as well as any animals with total ability modifiers of +3 or more. The latter are often found as pack leaders, herd “alphas,” and so on.

EXAMPLE**:** While visiting the fortress of Türos Tem, Yrsa notices that the legate’s medium war horse, Unconquered Sun, is quite exceptional, with the equine equivalent of DEX 15 and CON 16. While an ordinary war horse could not be harvested for special components, Unconquered Sun could be.

###### Summoned Creatures

Creatures summoned temporarily with spells or scrolls can never be harvested for special components. Creatures which have voluntarily entered this sphere of existence, become permanently bound to this sphere of existence, or been slain in their own sphere of existence can always be fully harvested. Casters who have studied this phenomenon believe there may be some balancing force built into the Logos that maintains spiritual flows across the spheres.

###### Mundane Market Value

In some cases, a monster part has value both as a non-magical trade good and as a special component. If the special component value is only a fraction of the mundane value, then only that fraction of the monster part is needed for the special component. The remainder of the part may be sold for a sum equal to its mundane value less its special component value. However, if the special component value is equal or greater than the mundane value, then all of the part is needed as a component.

###### Young and Weak Monsters

The spiritual residue of young and/or weak monsters quickly dissipates. Baby, juvenile, and adolescent monsters cannot be harvested for special components except in special circumstances (Judge’s discretion). Monsters that do not fight (such as goblin dredges) also cannot be harvested for special components, nor can monsters with less than ½ HD.

#### Expanding and Modifying Special Component Lists

The Monster Special Component lists are intended to be suggestive, not restrictive. Not every spell or effect in *ACKS* is included, nor is every monster. You should freely expand and modify the list to accommodate your own campaign setting. The following guidelines are intended to assist, not straightjacket, you in this regard.

###### Number of Special Components

Monsters with a broad array of special abilities tend to have their spiritual residue spread across a number of different special components. Each creature should be assigned a minimum of one special component. If the monster is capable of carrying a man-sized rider in flight, it should be assigned an additional special component. If the monster has at least 4 HD and three or more attacks per round, it should be assigned an additional special component. Finally, for each asterisk (special ability), the monster should assigned an additional special component. However, creatures whose substance is purely artificial, elemental, incorporeal, or ooze should always be assigned just one special component (usually some variation of blood or residue).

###### Selection of Associated Effects

In selecting the particular associations between monsters and spells, we were inspired by the historical laws of magic. The “law of correspondence” suggested that creatures should be associated with their own special abilities. Thus, invisible stalkers are associated with *invisibility,* while basilisks are associated with *petrification.*

The “law of similarity” suggested that creatures be associated with spells that imitate or resemble their own behaviors or abilities. Purple worms are associated with *earth’s movement* and *passwall* because they burrow through the earth. Basilisks are associated with *hypnotic sigil* because in both cases gazing results in helplessness for the victim.

The similarities are sometimes tied to folklore about the creature. Thus animals are associated with *predict weather* because folklore claims animals can do just that. (In-world, of course, the causality might run the other way: Folklore might claim animals can predict the weather becausemages use them as components to do that.)

The “law of polarity” suggested that creatures could be associated with spells that oppose their own behaviors or abilities. Bats, which rely on echolocation, are thus associated with *noiselessness.*

The “law of contagion” suggested that creatures be associated with spells that control, contact, or summon their type. Thus all undead are associated with *control undead*.

More powerful spell effects include lesser effects of the same name (e.g. *bewitch monster* includes *bewitch humanoid*).

###### Limitation on Common Effects

Because certain special abilities are exceptionally common, such as flight, infravision, and water breathing, use the following rules-of-thumb to further limit the number of associations. In most cases, creatures should be associated with *winged flight* only if their wings are unnatural additions to their body form, and with *flight* only if they are capable of carrying a man-sized rider. Creatures should be associated with *lightless vision* only if they have exceptional range of sight (90’+). Creatures should be associated with *water breathing* only if it is unnatural to the body form.

###### Number of Associated Effects

The total number of associated spell effects per monster should be capped at the greater of Hit Dice or number of special components. If necessary, the number of special components determined above can be adjusted one or two in either direction if that helps accommodate your desired assortment of associated effects. +1 weapon and armor bonuses count as one effect, +2 weapon and armor bonuses count as three effects, and +3 weapon and armor bonuses count as six effects.

**Note:** The rules for special components elaborated here were developed around the assumptions of its implied setting. The summary below should provide sufficient context for Judges to make sense of the mechanics and expand them for their own use.

In the Auran Empire, every living creature hosts within itself a shard of divine power called a soul. The ability of physical matter to host a soul is dependent on its configuration and properties - its *form* in classical parlance. Death results when the physical form becomes so damaged or decrepit that it can no longer contain a complete soul. When this occurs, the soul transmigrates to a new form which can contain it. This process is called reincarnation or *metempsychosis*.Complete reincarnation does not occur immediately, however. When a living creature dies, a residue of its soul may remain coagulate within the body for a time, only gradually dissipating from its corpse.

It is this residue of the soul that a spellcaster speaks with when using *speak with dead*. And it is this residue of the soul that makes the organs and blood of creatures valuable as special components. How much of a residual soul remains depends on many factors. How intact is the body? The more intact the body, the more residue of the soul will remain. How powerful was the deceased? More powerful souls tend to linger longer. What is the alignment of the spheres of existence? The more distant the outer spheres, the longer a soul will linger. How long has the creature been dead? The more time has elapsed, the less divine power will remain.

In game terms, the total amount of divine power possessed by a creature is equal to ten times its XP value. When a creature dies, about 90% of this value typically transmigrates very rapidly; the other 10% remains as a residue within the creature’s blood or organs, which can be harvested as special components for magical research. When a creature is sacrificed, 80% of its divine power passes to the entity worshipped, 10% is retained by the sacrificier for his own ends, and 10% remains residual within its blood and organs. This is why XP value = special component value = sacrifice value.

A living creature bleeds off divine power each day equal to 6% of its XP value. Casters use some of this to fuel their spells, but the rest is dissipated or bequeathed to a god through worship. A cleric that leads a congregant in worship collects about 10% while the god collects the rest – which is why 50 0-level congregants (worth 5xp each) generate (5 x 50 x 6% x 10% x 7) 10gp worth of divine power for their cleric.

Sages theorize that living creatures recover the power they bleed off biologically, by means of ingesting food, and that the reason undead “feed” is similar. In any case, a truly dead creature’s divine power simply bleeds off without means of recovery. To prevent this, monster parts containing divine power must be stored in special containers.

# Chapter 4: Monster Creation

The monsters that appear in *Adventurer Conqueror King System* run the gamut from ordinary animals and normal men to titanic dragons and awe-inspiring rocs. Despite the vast difference in scale and power these monsters can demonstrate, the mathematics behind them remains the same. The following steps will enable you to generate monsters that fall within the typical ranges of creatures in *ACKS.*

## Monster Creation Steps

1. Begin with a **concept** for the monster. A concept can be as general or specific as you wish. Useful sources of concepts include myth and legend; ancient and medieval bestiaries; fantasy and science fiction; comic books; and other games.
2. Choose your monster’s **type**. The monster types are animal, beastmen, construct, enchanted creature, giant, incarnation, humanoid, ooze, plant, undead, and vermin (see *ACKS*,p. 151). A monster can belong to multiple types. Monster type established the number and type of special abilities the creature may have. It determines the effectiveness of various *bewitch*, *discern, halt,* *holy circle*, and *slumber* spells against the creature. Monster type also interacts with the creature’s HD to determine its **saving throws**. See the **Monster Type** table, below.
3. Choose your monster’s **hit dice**. The weakest creatures have less than 1 HD, while the most powerful have 36 HD or more. HD is an abstract measure of a creature’s fighting ability and toughness, roughly paralleling a character’s class level. A monster’s HD will influence the monster’s **mass** and **normal load**, and determine its **armor class** and **damage**. HD also determines the monster’s base **XP value**, which in turn influences its **treasure type**.
4. Determine the monster’s **saving throws** by cross-referencing its Hit Dice with its type on the Monster Type table and rolling or choosing an appropriate value.
5. Select an appropriate **body form** for the monster based on your concept and its type. For instance, a monster might have a *canine* body form (like a dire wolf or hellhound), a *formic* body form (like a giant ant), or a *serpentine* body form (like a giant python or sea serpent). The choice of body form will interact with the monster’s HD to determine its mass and normal load, and determines its natural attacks. See the **Monster Body Form** table, below, for further details.
6. Determine the monster’s **weight** in pounds. The formula for weight is (HD x 10)BME. **BME** is the monster’s **body mass exponent**, a value that varies between 0 and 3 depending on the monster’s body form. BME values are found on the Monster Body Form table. The lower a creature’s BME, the more ferocious and dangerous it is for its size. Thus a tiger (BME 1.52) is far more dangerous pound-for-pound than a light horse (BME 2.31).
7. Determine the monster’s **size category** by finding its weight on the **Monster Size Category** table, below. Size category modifies AC, and also has an impact on many ancillary characteristics.
8. Determine the monster’s **normal load** in stone. The formula for normal load is (weight x carrying capacity factor). **Carrying capacity factor (CCF)** is a value which ranges from 0.01 to 1.0, depending on the monster’s body form. Carrying capacity factors are found on the Monster Body Form table.
9. Determine the monster’s **armor class**. The formula for monster AC is 0.8 x HD for up to 9 HD. HD after 9 do not increase AC. Round to the nearest whole number, rounding 0.5 up if odd and down if even. Body form may provide a bonus or penalty to AC, as shown on the Monster Body Form table. Size category may provide a bonus or penalty to AC, as shown on the Monster Size Category table. Draconine body form follows slightly different rules (see footnote on p. XX).
10. Choose the monster’s **natural attacks**. The recommended natural attacks for each body form are listed on the Monster Body Form table. You can add, remove, or modify these natural attacks as appropriate for the type of monster you are creating. Monster attack throws are determined based on Hit Dice (as per *ACKS*,p. 102).
11. Determine the monster’s **damage** from its attacks. The monster’s attacks should inflict an average of 2 hp of damage per HD the monster possesses. This damage may be divided among all their attacks as desired. For instance, a monster with 5 HD should inflict an average of (5 x 2) hp of damage per round. If the monster has two attacks, it might deal 2d4 damage with each. The **Monster Natural Attack** table offers recommended monster damage by natural attack at various HD ranges.
12. Decide the monster’s **speed**.The recommended speeds for each body form are listed on the **Monster Body Form** table.
13. Assign **special senses** and **special abilities** to the monster. A monster can have from zero to five special abilities. (You can create monsters with more than five special abilities if you want, but they’ll be very powerful.) You can choose the number based on your concept, or may randomly determine the number by rolling the dice listed for its type on the **Monster Type** table. For each special ability, you should roll or choose one selection from the **Monster Special Abilities** table. Note which, if any, special abilities count towards the monster’s XP value, and record these as asterisks next to its HD. Note that some special abilities may change the monster’s natural attacks, damage, armor class, or speed. Update those characteristics where appropriate.
14. Decide the monster’s **morale** score, from -4 to +4. Mindless monsters have no morale score and never check morale.
15. Calculate the monster’s **XP value**. To calculate a monster’s XP, begin with the base XP value for its Hit Dice on the **Monster Experience Table**. Add the value for the XP bonus per \*, multiplied by the number of special abilities the monster has.
16. Choose the monster’s **typical dungeon encounter** and **typical wilderness encounter.** Each typical encounter entry should be listed as: [Collective Noun] (Number Encountered) / [Collective Noun] (Number Encountered). The first collective noun (e.g., “gang”) and subsequent number encountered (“2d4”) describes encounters outside of the creature’s lair. The second collective noun (“lair”) and subsequent number encountered (“1 warband”) describes encounters inside the creature’s lair. The number encountered in the lair is usually a distinct number of monsters (such as “2d6”), but sometimes is based on the ranges encountered outside the lair (e.g., “1 warband”). The latter is common for monsters that have a clan or tribal structure. If the monster does not make a lair, then list only one collective noun and range. If the monster is not found in one of the two settings (dungeon or wilderness), list “none.” The **Monster Organization** table offers recommendations for typical encounters.
17. Determine the monster’s **degree of intelligence**. Monsters can possess sapient intelligence; animal intelligence; or mindless. The **Monster Intelligence by Type** table shows the options available for each type of monster and the **Animal Intelligence by Body Form** shows trainability modifier and base training time.
18. Choose the monster’s **alignment** from the available options on the **Monster Alignment** table.
19. Determine the nature and value of the **monster’s spoils,** including special components as well as mundane antlers, claws, horns, feathers, pelts, etc.
20. Calculate the monster’s taming and training characteristics including calculating its **lifespan**, **battle rating**, **trained value**, and **untrained values**.
21. Determine the monster’s **treasure type**. First, determine the monster’s **average treasure value** by multiplying the XP value of one monster by 4 times the average number of monsters encountered in its lair. Then decide whether the monster accumulates treasure by hoarding, by raiding, or by accident. Consult the **Monster Treasure Type** table, cross-referencing its average treasure value with its method of treasure accumulation to find its treasure type.
22. Review your monster and make any adjustments desired. If you’re happy, tabulate your design in a monster listing and write up a short summary of its appearance, behavior, and habitat. Your monster is complete!

## Monster Type

Monster types are groups of creatures with similar characteristics. The monster types are **animal**, **beastman**, **construct**, **enchanted creature**, **giant humanoid**, **humanoid**, **incarnation**, **monstrosity**, **ooze**, **plant**, **undead**, and **vermin**. A creature can belong to multiple types. For instance, skeletons are undead constructs. Monster type determines the effectiveness of various enchantment spells against the creature, the creature’s immunities and saving throws, and the number of special abilities it can possess. The **Monster Type** table summarizes these characteristics. See **Monster Types** (p. XX) in Chapter 1 for full descriptions of each type.

|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Monster Type** | **Susceptibilities** | **Immunities** | **Saving Throws** | **No. Special Abilities** |
| Animal | *Bewitch/halt beast* | Usually none | Fighter (HD/2) | 1d4-2 |
| Beastman | *Bewitch/halt humanoid* | Usually none | Fighter (HD) | 1d4-2 |
| Construct | *Dispel/holy circle* | Enchantment, necrotic, poison, various | Fighter (HD/2 x 1d2) | 2d6-7 |
| Enchanted Creature | *Dispel/holy circle* | Various | Fighter (HD/2 x 2d2) | 1d10-5 |
| Giant Humanoid | *Bewitch/halt monster* | Various | Fighter (HD) | 1d4-2 |
| Humanoid | *Bewitch/halt person* | Usually none | Fighter (HD) | 1d4-2 |
| Incarnation | *Dispel/holy circle* | Poison, various | Fighter (HD/2 x 2d2) | 1d10-5 |
| Monstrosity | *Bewitch/halt monster* | Various | Fighter (HD/4 x 1d8) | 2d6-7 |
| Ooze | *Bewitch/halt monster* | Enchantment, various | Fighter (HD/2) | 1d4 |
| Plant | *Dominate plant* | Various | Fighter (HD/2) | 1d4 |
| Undead | *Dispel/holy circle*  Control undead  Rebuke undead | Enchantment, necrotic, poison | Fighter (HD) | 2d6-7 |
| Vermin | Bewitch/halt monster | Usually none | Fighter (HD/2) | 1d4-2 |

## Monster Hit Dice

Hit Dice are an abstract measure of a monster’s fighting ability and toughness. The weakest monsters have less than 1 HD, while the most powerful have 36 HD or more. Hit Dice affect a monster’s hit points, size category, armor class, attack throws, saving throws, damage, experience point value, treasure type.

**Bonus Hit Points:** Some monsters may have a bonus of one or more hit points applied to their Hit Dice. These monsters have a Hit Die listing such as “1+1” or “4+2”. Each bonus point counts as 0.25 Hit Dice for purposes such as calculating monster weight, armor class, carrying capacity, and damage.

## Monster Saving Throws

Most monsters save as fighters. At your discretion, a monster can be assigned a saving throw progression of a crusader, dwarven craftpriest, dwarven vaultguard, elven nightblade, elven spellsword, mage, or thief in lieu of fighter. Crusader saving throws are appropriate for monsters with divine spellcasting or spell-like abilities. Mage saving throws are appropriate for monsters with arcane spellcasting or spell-like abilities. Thief saving throws are unusual, but might be appropriate for monsters with thief class abilities or a general focus on ambush and stealth. Dwarf and elf saving throws should only be assigned to monsters that have some close kinship with those races.

## Monster Body Form

Select an appropriate **body form** for the monster from the table below. The choice of body form will interact with the monster’s HD to determine its AC, weight, and normal load, and determines its natural attacks and movement. It also impacts the monster’s organization (p. XX) and intelligence (p. XX), discussed separately.

### Hybrid Body Forms

If desired, a monster may have a hybrid body form. You can assign the hybrid the movement capabilities of either or both body forms. If it has the movement of both, this counts as a special ability. The hybrid will have the AC modifier of the body form from which it was assigned its movement capabilities. If it has the movement of both, it will have whichever AC is better. A hybrid may be assigned the attacks of either or both body forms. If it has the attacks of both, this counts as a special ability. A hybrid may have the BME and CCF values of either body form or a mid-range value between the two.

## Monster Weight, Size Category and Armor Class

A monster’s weight is determined by its HD and its body mass exponent, according to the formula *weight = (HD x 10)BME*. The monster’s mass then determines its size category, as shown on the table below. A creature’s size category usually determines its height and length. Wingspans of flying creatures will typically be three times length. Creatures with light bones or long frames can be assigned a higher size category than their weight warrants; those made of heavy materials such as iron can be assigned a smaller size category than their weight (Judge’s discretion).

EXAMPLE: The Judge is creating a 20 HD monster inspired by Shelob of Middle Earth fame. It has an arachnine body form with BME 1.68, so the monster weighs ((20\*10)1.68) 7,340 lbs. That classifies the arachnine as huge size. The Judge notes the high CCF of 0.125. The monster’s carrying capacity is therefore (7,340 x 0.125) 918 stone – enough to wrap up and carry off an entire clan of meddlesome halflings.

### Square-Cube Law (Optional)

In real life, animals are proportionately weaker the heavier they are, because strength increases with area (square) while weight increases with volume (cube). The ratio which governs strength and weight is known as the square-cube law. If you want to take into account the square-cube law’s effects on carrying capacity, find a creature of the same body form with a known weight to use as a baseline. Your new monster’s carrying capacity will be (baseline monster’s [CCF) x (new monster’s weight)] x [(new monster’s weight / baseline monster’s weight)2/3 / (new monster’s weight / baseline monster’s weight)]. This rule dramatically reduces the carrying capacity of larger monsters.

We only recommend using this rule when creating new monsters that are one or more size categories larger than is typical for that body form. It’s not worth worrying about the square-cube law when dealing with weight variances like those of a panther and a lion, or an elephant and mammoth, but it will make a difference if you are creating a 20 HD 3,000 lb giant cat or 65-ton 36 HD elephant. In this book, we have generally used the square-cube law for real-world animals and giant humanoids. We have ignored it for other magical or imaginary monsters.

EXAMPLE: The ersatz Shelob weighs 7,340 lbs. A giant tarantula weighs 500 lbs. Since the spider is in a larger size category than other monsters of its body form, the Judge decides to use the square-cube law. The huge new spider’s carrying capacity is therefore [(0.125) x (7,340)] x [(7,340/500)2/3 / (7,340/500)] = 375 stone.

### AC Modifier

Armor class starts at 0 and increases with Hit Dice at a rate of 0.8 AC per HD for the first 9 HD. (Round the result to the nearest whole number, rounding 0.5 up if odd and down if even.) Additional HD thereafter do not increase AC. More massive monsters are, by virtue of size and bulk, easier to hit than smaller monsters. This is reflected with a modifier to armor class on the Monster Size Category table, above. Body forms may also provide a bonus or penalty to AC, as shown on the Monster Body Form table. AC may also vary by one point in either direction due to minor differences in agility, natural armor, etc. between species. Roll 1d6 or choose. 1-2: -1 AC; 3-4: +0 AC; 5-6: +1 AC.

EXAMPLE**:** The ersatz Shelob has 20 HD, but only the first 9 count for AC purposes, so it has a base AC of (0.8 x 9) 7.2, rounded to 7. As an arachnine, it has an AC modifier of +1. As a huge monster, the arachnine has an AC modifier of -2. Its final AC is (7 + 1 - 2) 6. The Judge decides his arachnine has a thick, spiky carapace, so he adjusts its AC by +1 to 7.

### Unnaturally Tough Monsters

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Monster Size and Hit Dice** | |
| **Size** | **Maximum Hit Dice** |
| Man-Sized or less | 9 |
| Large | 13 |
| Huge | 17 |
| Gigantic | 25 |
| Colossal | 40 |

The rules for Hit Dice, body mass exponent, and weight assume a naturalistic progression of size, durability, and fighting power. Ogres are bigger than orcs, so they have more HD; elephants are bigger than horses, so they have more HD. But some monsters are unnaturally tough – they possess HD that are disproportionate to their size and weight, whether due to combat skill, innate power, or magical enhancement.

To create an unnaturally tough monster, just calculate the creature’s weight, carrying capacity, and size category using some arbitrarily low HD value that yields the desired results. Then calculate its hit points, attack throws, Armor Class, damage, saving throws, experience point value, and treasure type using another, higher HD value. (This process can be used in reverse to create unnaturally weak monsters.)

In the absence of magic, there is a limit to how unnaturally tough a monster can be. The Monster Size and Hit Dice table, above, shows the maximum HD permitted for monsters of various size categories. Enchanted creatures, incarnations, and undead can ignore these restrictions. See Advancing Monstrous Henchmen, p. XX, for additional rules for advancing monsters past the usual limits.

EXAMPLE: The Judge is creating a monstrosity with a humanoid body form (BME 1.88). He wants the creature to be man-sized, about 250 lbs, but to have fighting ability superior to that of a hill giant (8 HD). Normally, an 8 HD humanoid with BME 1.88 would weigh (8\*10)1.88 = 3,782 lbs, so he must create an unnaturally tough monster. For the purposes of weight and size, he sets its HD at 1+2, yielding a 162-pound man-sized monster. For all other purposes its HD is 8. The Judge cannot make its HD 10 or more, because man-sized monstrosities cannot exceed 9 HD, even if unnaturally tough. (If the monster were an enchanted creature or undead it could possess 10, 15, or even 40 HD while still being man-sized.)

## Monster Natural Attack Table

In most cases, the monster’s attack sequence should inflict an average of 2 hp of damage per HD the monster possesses divided among all their attacks. But how much should each of those attacks do? The **Monster Natural Attack** table offers recommended monster damage for some common natural attacks at various HD ranges. These values are extrapolated from those that appear in *ACKS* and can be used to help determine a new monster’s damage from its attacks. These values are guidelines only, however, and you should feel free to diverge from them as necessary to balance the monster. Damage type will depend on the natural weapon, the monster type, and the monster HD and special abilities.

EXAMPLE #1: The Judge is creating an 8 HD animal with an ursine body form called the koalatau*r*. An ursine’s natural attacks are 2 claws and 1 bite. Its average damage per attack sequence should be around (8 x 2) 16 points. The Judge chooses 2 small claws (at 8 HD, these deal 1d6 points of damage each) and 1 small bite (at 8 HD, this deals 2d8 points of damage). The koalataur’s average damage per attack sequence is (3.5 + 3.5 + 9) 16 points.

EXAMPLE: #2: The Judge is creating a 10 HD monstrosity with a scolopendrine body form called the chittering crawler. A scolopendrine’s natural attacks are 1 bite and 0-8 tentacles. Its average damage per attack sequence should be around (10 x 2) 20 points. The Judge first chooses 1 medium bite dealing 2d10 points of damage. That equates to an average of 11 points of damage per round, so the Judge must distribute another 9 points of average damage across the monster’s other attacks. He opts for 6 tentacles dealing 1d2 points of damage each. The chittering crawler’s average damage per attack sequence is [11 + 6 x (1.5)] 20 points.

### Monsters with Weapons

Some monsters may use weapons in lieu of or in addition to natural attacks. Monsters using a normal weapon such as a sword, battle axe, or mace inflict an average of 2.5 hp of damage plus 1 hp of damage per HD the monster possesses. The amount should be increased or decreased if the weapon is tiny or large. Extra damage dice can be granted in lieu of a damage bonus (e.g., grant +1d6 instead of +4 damage). Monsters using weapons can be given a fighter damage bonus based on their HD when using weapons.

EXAMPLE: Orcs are 1 HD beastmen, so they do an average of (2.5 + 1) = 3.5 or 1d6 damage with weapons. Hobgoblins are 1+1 HD, but gain an additional fighter damage bonus of +1, so they deal 4.5 or 1d6+1 damage with weapons.

## Monster Special Senses

All monsters come equipped with sensory abilities that enable them to perceive their environment. By default:

* Animals with land or flying speed have Night Vision and either Acute Hearing, Olfaction, or Vision.
* Monsters of any type with swim speed have either Echolocation or Aquatic Mechanoreception.
* Monsters other than Animals have Lightless Vision (60’).

Additional senses can be gained as special abilities. At your discretion, some monsters might lack one or more of their default senses. Missing senses can be considered special disabilities (described below).

## Monster Special Abilities

A monster may have from zero to five special abilities, in addition to any immunities from its monster type. You can choose the number based on your concept, or randomly determine the number by rolling the dice listed for its type on the Monster Type table.

For each special ability, you should roll or choose one selection from the Monster Special Abilities table, below. When rolling on the Monster Special Abilities table, re-roll any results that duplicate abilities the monster already possesses, except where otherwise noted. At your discretion, particular special abilities may be chosen based on existing powers, or adjusted to match earlier results. For example, if the first ability a monster gains is a fire aura, and a later roll indicates an immunity, it would make sense for the immunity to be versus fire damage. All results are cumulative. Note that some special abilities may change the monster’s natural attacks, damage, armor class, or speed. Update those characteristics where appropriate.

You should always feel free to modify the text of the special abilities, whether to tweak their balance, create new mechanics, or simply be whimsical. An Aura doesn’t haveto extend 2’ per HD; a breath weapon doesn’t have to do 1d6 points of damage per HD. Strictly following these rules will result in monsters whose capabilities are well-aligned with those already existing monsters of the *ACKS* canon, but sometimes the most interesting monsters are the ones that are totally different from the canon.

### Major and Minor Special Abilities

On the table, special abilities are divided into **major abilities,** marked with one or more asterisks (\*), and **minor abilities**, marked with one or more hashtags (#). These classifications are important for calculating a monster’s XP value – minor abilities are worth approximately one-eighth as much per hashtag.

After all special abilities have been assigned, add up the number of # from all minor abilities and divide by 8. Add this number to the number of \* from major abilities. Round the total to the nearest whole number, rounding .5 down if even, up if odd. Now record the total next to the monster’s HD; this will be used to calculate the monster’s XP value in the next step.

EXAMPLE #1: The koalataur is an animal, so it has 1d4-2 special abilities. The die roll is a 3, so it has one special ability. The Judge rolls 1d100 and gets an 83, so it has a Swallow Attack. This is a major ability (\*). The Judge notes that the koalataur is an 8\* HD monster.

EXAMPLE: #2: The chittering crawler is a monstrosity, so it has 2d6-7 special abilities. The dice yield a 11, so it has 4 special abilities. The Judge rolls 1d100 four times and gets Grab, Invisibility, Stealth, and Swiftness. Invisibility does not fit with his concept for the monster, so the Judge disregards that result and instead selects Ongoing Damage, which works nicely with Grab. He decides that a successful hit with a tentacle triggers the Grab, and that grabbed victims are then gnawed on, suffering 2d10 points of Ongoing Damage per round (equal to the chittering crawler’s primary attack) until they free themselves. Grab is a major ability worth \*, while Ongoing Damage is worth #### while Stealth and Swiftness are each worth #. The chittering crawler has 1 + [(4+2)/8] = 1.75 major abilities, which rounds to 2. The Judge notes that the chittering crawler is a 10\*\* HD monster.

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Usage | Usage Factor | Usage | Usage Factor |
| At will | 1 | 1/day | 0.4 |
| 1/turn | 0.8 | 1/week | 0.3 |
| 1/3 turns | 0.7 | 1/month | 0.2 |
| 1/hour | 0.6 | 1/season | 0.1 |
| 3/day | 0.5 | 1/year | 0.05 |

Spell-like special abilities count as one or more minor abilities (#) each. Multiply 2 x the level of the spell-like ability by the usage factor shown on the adjoining table.

However, because monsters often don’t survive more than 3 to 5 rounds of combat, a monster that has a large number of spell-like abilities can seem more powerful on paper than it is during actual game play. When a creature has more than four spell-like abilities, only count the four most powerful effects (by spell level and usage factor).

EXAMPLE #3: A lamia can cast *perpetual figment* at will (6th level, usage 1), *word of command* at will (1st level, usage 1), *illusory duplicates* once per day (2nd level, usage 0.4), and *bewitch humanoid* once per day (1st level, usage 0.4). Its spell-like abilities count as [ (2 x 4 x 1) + (2 x 1 x 1) + (2 x 2 x 0.4) + (2 x 1 x 0.4) ] 12.4 minor abilities. 12.4 minor abilities equals 1.55 major abilities, rounded to 2. A lamia also has the ability to enslave creatures with its touch, an unusual major ability (\*). A lamia therefore has 3 major abilities, and is recorded as a 9\*\*\* HD monster.

What if the lamia also had the ability to cast *arcane armor* once per day (1st level, usage 0.4) and *discern magic* once per day (1st level usage, 0.4)? These would not increase its number of \* because only the four most powerful spell-like abilities get counted.

### Special Disabilities

A monster may also be assigned special disabilities. For each special disability assigned to a monster, it may be assigned one additional special ability, up to the maximum number permitted for a monster of that type. Disabilities can also reduce the number of \* recorded next to the monster’s HD, if you assesses it is likely to meaningfully weaken the creature in play, or if it entirely offsets an otherwise-potent special ability. A list of sample disabilities appears below:

* Can be rebuked -###;
* Hateful towards particular creature type; attacks on sight regardless of circumstances -##
* Instantly killed by ordinary spell effect (such as cure disease) or condition (such as daylight) -\*\*
* Rendered dormant by otherwise ordinary condition (such as daylight) -\*
* Sensitive to common environmental condition; suffers -1d3 attack penalty -##
* Substantial reduction in speed or loss of the special movement capability typical for its body type; -by type
* Susceptible to particular type of attack; suffers double damage or loses normal immunity or resistance; -by susceptibility
* Susceptible to particular type of attack; paralyzed for one round per die of damage the attack deals

EXAMPLE: A monster has immunity to mundane physical damage. This counts as a special ability (\*) for XP purposes. However, the monster suffers double damage against extraordinary physical damage. The Judge decides that this more than offsets the creature’s immunity to normal weapons since in actual play it will tend to take double damage. He removes the \* from its immunity.

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Roll** | | **Special Ability** |
| 01-02 | | **Acid (\*):** The monster’s attacks destroy non-magical armor or clothing on a successful hit. A non-magical weapon that strikes the monster dissolves immediately after dealing damage. Magical weapons and armor are allowed a saving throw using the wearer’s Death save, adding any magical bonus to the roll if applicable. |
| 03-04 | | **Aura (\*):** The monster is surrounded by a damaging aura that deals damage to susceptible creatures each round. The aura has a radius of 1’ per HD, (minimum 5’) and deals 1d8 damage per round. Roll 1d8 for the type of aura: 1, arcane; 2, acidic; 3, cold; 4, electrical; 5, fire; 6, luminous or necrotic; 7, poisonous; 8, seismic. |
| 05 | | **Berserk (##):** The monster gains a +2 bonus to attack rolls and is immune to fear. Its morale score is raised to +4. |
| 06-07 | | **Bonus Attack (varies):** The monster gains one or more bonus attacks. Roll 1d6: 1-3, one bonus attack dealing damage equal to its primary attack; 4-6, two bonus attacks each dealing damage equal to its secondary attack (or half its primary attack). If the bonus attack can be used with a special ability worth \* or if it increases the monster’s average damage to more than 4 points per HD, it counts as a special ability (\*) for XP purposes. Otherwise it is a minor ability (##). |
| 08-09 | | **Breath Weapon (\*):** The monster gains a dragon-like breath weapon usable 3/day. The breath weapon deals 1d6 extraordinary damage per HD of the monster, with a successful Blast save reducing damage by half. Roll 1d8 for the type of breath weapon or choose: 1, flame (fire); 2, lightning (electric); 3, freezing vapors (cold); 4, poison vapor (poisonous); 5, sonic blast (seismic); 6, blistering corrosive (acidic); 7, magical force (arcane); 8, fetid gas (necrotic) or holy fire (luminous). Area of effect and special properties are as per a dragon. |
| 10-12 | | **Charge (##):** The monster is capable of making charge attacks that deal double damage dice. Choose one natural attack type for the charge. |
| 13-14 | | **Class Powers/Proficiencies (varies):** The monster gains 1d4 class powers or proficiencies, selected based on the monster’s overall design (Judge’s choice), excluding spellcasting. Each class power counts as one #. General proficiencies are ignored for these purposes. |
| 15-16 | | **Dreadful (\*):** Creatures that start their initiative or move within 60’ of the monster must succeed on Paralysis saving throws or **falter.** If the character is already **cowering** or **faltering**, he is frightened instead. Creatures with class level or HD equal to or greater than ½ the monster’s HD are immune to the dread. |
| 17-18 | | **Enervation(\*\*):** A character damaged by the monster’s primary attack reduces his maximum hp by the amount of damage dealt and becomes **enervated**. |
| 19-20 | | **Enslave (\*):** The monster can enslave victims to its will 3/day or by gaze. The target must succeed on a Spells save or be **enslaved** to the monster. If the monster has 3 HD or less, the save is at +2. If the monster has 9 HD or more, the save is at -2. |
| 21-23 | | **Flying (####):** The monster is capable of flying at an exploration speed equal to twice its land speed. If it already flies, it becomes capable of making dive attacks that deal double damage. If a dive hits a victim smaller than itself, it grabs and carries him off, unless the victim makes a successful size-adjusted Paralysis save. If it already has a dive attack, re-roll. |
| 24-25 | | **Grab/Restrain (\*):** The monster gains the ability to grab or restrain its targets. Roll 1d20: 1-14, it gains a constriction attack that deals damage equal to its primary attack and restrains any creature struck that is smaller than the monster; 15-17, If it hits a creature smaller than itself with at least two of its secondary attacks, the creature struck must make a successful size-adjusted Paralysis save or be grabbed; 18-20, if it hits a creature smaller than itself with its primary attack, the creature struck must make a successful size-adjusted Paralysis save or be grabbed. |
| 26-27 | | **Horrific (\*):** Creatures encountering the monster must make a successful Paralysis save at the start of the first round or be **cowering** until the start of the second round. |
| 26-31 | | **Hug (##):** If the monster hits with more than half its attacks during its attack sequence, it deals additional {B} or {B!} damage: 2d6 if man-sized, 2d8 if large, 2d10 if huge, 2d12 if gigantic, and 2d20 if colossal. |
| 32-37 | | **Immunity (varies)**: The monster gains immunity. Roll 1d12: 1, all mundane damage \*; 2, all extraordinary damage \*; 3, all physical damage\*; 4, all energy damage\*; 5, any 6 damage types \*; 6, any 3 damage types ####; 7, any mundane physical damage ####; 8, any 3 mundane damage types ##; 9, all enchantment effects ####; 10, all death effects ####; 11, all transmogrification effects ####; 12, roll 1d8+4 twice. Re-roll if the monster is already immune to the effect. |
| 38 | | **Incorporeal (\*):** The monster is formless, weightless, and unable to interact with physical objects except through its attacks or special abilities. It becomes immune to mundane damage. However, if an incorporeal monster has 4 HD or less, it considers damage dealt by silver weapons to be extraordinary damage. It can select enervation and flying as special abilities. |
| 39 | | **Infectious (##):** The monster is able to transform its victims into others of its kind or a lesser kind. Creatures slain by the monster might rise as monsters of its type unless appropriate measures are taken; or victims suffering loss of half or more of their hit points to the monster’s natural attacks might become a monster of its type after 2d6 days. |
| 40-41 | | **Invisibility (\*):** The monster is naturally invisible. It may act freely, including attacking, without becoming visible. |
| 42-43 | | **Lightning Reflexes (##):** The monster is extremely fast, and gains a +2 bonus to initiative. |
| 44 | | **Magic Resistance (\*):** The monster gains magic resistance with a throw modifier equal to its HD – 7. |
| 45-48 | | **Ongoing Damage (####):** Once the monster has hit its victim, it can use its combat action to automatically deal ongoing damage each round equal to its most damaging attack. It does not grab or restrain the target, but it does count as encumbrance equal to its weight. |
| 49-51 | | **Paralysis (\*):** Victims of the monster’s primary attack(s) must succeed on Paralysis saves or be **paralyzed**. Roll 1d6: 1-2, paralysis lasts for 1d10 rounds; 3-6, paralysis lasts for 2d4 turns. |
| 52-53 | | **Petrification (\*\*):** Any victim that either (1-3) meets the monster’s gaze or (4-6) is struck by the monster’s attack(s) is required to make a Paralysis saving throw or be turned to stone. |
| 54-61 | | **Poison (\*):** Creatures damaged by the monster’s primary attack(s) must make successful Death save or be poisoned. Roll 1d20 to determine onset time: 1-12, instant (at the end of the monster’s initiative); 13-14, 1 turn; 15, 1d4 turns; 16-19 1d4+2 turns; 20, 1 d10 turns. Roll 1d20 to determine effect 1-16, death; 17-19: paralysis 2d4 turns + 1d6 damage per HD; 20: incapacitation. If the monster has 3 HD or less, the save is at +2. If the monster has 9 HD or more, the save is at -2. |
| 62-63 | | **Regeneration (\*):** The monster regenerates hit points each round, with the ability to re-attach lost limbs, unless the damage is of two particular types (usually fire and acid). The amount regenerated will be HD/2 per round. |
| 64-67 | | **Resistance (varies):** The monster gains resistances. Roll 1d12 twice: 1, all mundane damage ####; 2, all extraordinary damage ####; 3, all physical damage ####; 4, all energy damage ####; 5, any 6 damage types ####; 6, any 3 damage types ##; 7, all mundane physical damage types ##; 8, any 3 mundane damage types #; 9, all enchantment effects ##; 10, all death effects ##; 11, all transmogrification effects ##; 12, roll 1d8+4 twice. If the same effect is rolled twice, the monster becomes immune (as above). Re-roll if the monster is already immune to the effect. |
| 68-69 | | **Special Senses (varies):** The monster has a special sensory capacity. Roll 1d6: 1, Acute Hearing (#); 2, Acute Olfaction (#); 3, Acute Vision (#); 4, Night Vision (#); 5, Echolocation (##); 6, Mechanoreception (#). Choose type of mechanoreception based on the monster’s other capabilities. Aerial mechanoreception and echolocation range is equal to the monster’s best encounter speed. Aquatic mechanoreception is equal to the monster’s swimming encounter speed. |
| 70-71 | | **Spellcasting (varies)**: The monster can cast spells as if it were a classed character with a level equal to its HD (maximum 14th level). Roll 1d10: 1 bladedancer\*, 2-3 crusader\*, 4-6 mage\*\*, 7 shaman\*, 8 priestess\*\*, 9 warlock\*\*, 10 wonderworker\*\*\*. |
| 72-75 | | **Spell-like Abilities (varies):** The monster gains 1d4 spell-like abilities. Generate the abilities as if rolling for spell scrolls or select appropriate abilities based on the monster’s other powers (Judge’s choice). Each spell-like ability counts as one or more minor abilities (#). Multiply 2 x spell level x the usage factor. |
| 76-80 | | **Stealth (#):** The monster is difficult to notice. Characters encountering the monster in its natural habitat suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls. |
| 81-83 | | **Swallow Attack (\*):** The monster can swallow whole victims two size categories smaller than itself on an unmodified attack throw of 20. A victim that is swallowed whole takes damage equal to the monster’s HD each round until the monster is killed or the victim dies. If the monster is of gigantic size, it can swallow on 19-20; if of colossal size, on 18-20. If the monster is not at least huge size, re-roll. |
| 84-86 | | **Swift (##):** The monster moves rapidly. Its speed is increased by 30’ for every 120’ of base encounter movement |
| 87-88 | **Terrifying (\*):** The monster can cause panic and terror by taking a combat action. The area of effect is 100 square feet per HD. Each affected creature must succeed on a Paralysis save or become **frightened**. Creatures with class level or HD of ½ the monster’s HD or less **falter** even if the save succeeds. | |
| 89-91 | | **Topple and Fling (####):** When the monster hits with its primary attack, it can topple and fling creatures that are at least two size classes smaller than itself. The creature struck must make a size-adjusted Paralysis saving throw. If the save fails, the creature is knocked prone and forced back a number of feet equal to the damage dealt. If this would push the creature into a wall or other obstacle, the creature takes 1d6 {B} damage per 10’ he has traveled. If the monster is not at least huge sized, re-roll. |
| 92-94 | | **Tough (varies)**: The monster is unusually tough or hardy. Its AC is increased by 1d4 points. If this increases its AC to more than its HD x 1.5, this counts as an \*. Otherwise it counts as ##. |
| 95-97 | | **Trample (##):** The monster gains a trample attack which it may use in lieu of its normal attack sequence. The trample attack should inflict an average of 2 hp of {B} damage per HD the monster possesses. The monster gains a +4 bonus to attack targets at least two sizes smaller than itself and can force back such creatures. If the monster is not at least large sized, re-roll. |
| 98-99 | | **Vicious Attack (####):** The monster has a vicious attack. On an unmodified attack throw of 20, the creature struck by the attack must make a Death save. If the save succeeds, the creature suffers double damage. If the save fails, the creature suffers triple damage and has a limb broken. If the monster is of gigantic size, it can dismember on 19-20; if of colossal size, on 18-20. If the monster is not at least large sized, re-roll. |
| 100 | | **Unusual (\* or more):** The monster has a rare, unique, or special power determined by the Judge. |

## Monster Organization

Choose the monster’s **typical dungeon encounter** and **typical wilderness encounter.** Each typical encounter entry should be listed as: [Collective Noun] (Number Encountered) / [Collective Noun] (Number Encountered). The first collective noun (e.g., “gang”) and subsequent number encountered (“2d4”) describes encounters outside of the creature’s lair. The second collective noun (“lair”) and subsequent number encountered (“1 warband”) describes encounters inside the creature’s lair.

The number encountered in the lair is usually a distinct number of monsters (such as “2d6”), but sometimes is based on the ranges encountered outside the lair (e.g., “1 warband”). The latter is common for monsters that have a clan or tribal structure. If the monster does not make a lair, then list only one collective noun and range. If the monster is not found in one of the two settings (dungeon or wilderness), list “none.”

At this time, you also select the monster’s **Lair** score. This can range from None, for nomadic monsters that maintain no den or nest of any sort, to 100%, for purely sedentary monsters that never leave their lair. The average Lair score is 25%, although this varies widely by body form and even within body forms depending on the monster’s diet and metabolism.

The **Monster Organization** table, below, offers recommendations for typical encounter and % In Lair by body form. These are presented as an average number of Hit Dice for each type of encounter (wandering dungeon, lair dungeon, wandering wilderness, lair wilderness). Monsters with HD which exceed the recommended HD are usually solitary (1).

EXAMPLE #1: The koalataur is an 8 HD ursine. An ursine’s recommended monster organization is sloth (10 HD) for wandering dungeon or wandering wilderness and den (10 HD) for lair dungeon or lair wilderness. 10 HD divided by 8 HD yields 1.25, so there should be 1.25 monsters in a typical encounter. A roll of 1d2 yields an average of 1.5, which is both close to the recommended number and seems like it could represent individuals and/or mated pairs. The Judge records the koalataur’s typical dungeon encounter as sloth (1d2)/den (1d2) and typical wilderness encounter as sloth (1d2)/den (1d2). He selects the default % In Lair of 25%.

EXAMPLE: #2: The chittering crawler is a 10 HD scolopendrine. A scolopendrine’s recommended monster organization is claw (7 HD) for wandering dungeon or wandering wilderness. Since 10 HD exceeds 7 HD, the Judge records his monster’s typical dungeon encounter as solitary (1) and typical wilderness encounter as solitary (1). Since his critter is so large, he decides it is less nomadic than other scolopendrines, and sets % In Lair to 30% instead of the default 10%.

## Monster Intelligence

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Monster Type** | **Intelligence** |
| Animal | Bestial or Semi-Sapient |
| Beastman | Sapient |
| Construct | Mindless or Sapient |
| Enchanted Creature | Any |
| Giant Humanoid | Sapient |
| Humanoid | Sapient |
| Incarnation | Any |
| Monstrosity | Bestial, Semi-Sapient or Sapient |
| Ooze | Mindless |
| Undead | Sapient or Mindless |
| Vermin | Bestial |

Monsters can be mindless, bestial, semi-sapient, or sapient. Mindless creatures function purely on instinct. Bestial monsters are aware of their environment, can remember past events, and can engage in limited problem-solving, but are not self-aware. Semi-sapient monsters are self-aware but lack one or more of the capabilities of sapient creatures, such as abstract reasoning, grammatical language, or tool use. Sapient creatures are self-aware and capable of abstract reasoning, grammatical language, and tool use. Most constructs and oozes are mindless, while most animals and vermin are bestial. Some animals, such as apes, elephants, parrots, and ravens, are semi-sapient. Monstrosities can be bestial, semi-sapient, or sapient. Giants and humanoids are always sapient. A creature’s sapiency determines the opportunity and frequency for it to make saving throws against certain spells.

You should select whatever is appropriate given your creative vision for the monster. Monsters of bestial intelligence will have a trainability modifier and training period determined by their body form. The **Monster Intelligence by Body Form** table has recommended trainability modifiers and training periods for the various body forms. You can modify these as desired to represent the temperament and intelligence of different species.

EXAMPLE: The chittering crawler is a monstrosity. Consulting the Monster Intelligence by Type table, the Judge sees a monstrosity can have either animal or sapient intelligence. He envisions his monster as brutish and instinctual, so he gives it animal intelligence. Reviewing the Animal Intelligence by Body Form table, he sees that a scolopendrine form has trainability modifier -3 and base training period 4.5 months. The Judge decides that his monster is more cunning but more vicious than a typical scolopendrine; he improves the trainability modifier to -1, but worsens the creature’s base training period to 6 months.

## Monster Alignment

A monster’s alignment is restricted by its type:

1. Animals, being typically concerned with mere survival, are generally Neutral. Some animals, blessed by gods or powerfully symbolic of virtue and order, may be Lawful. The Narwhal is an example of a Lawful animal. Animals, as part of the natural world, are never Chaotic.
2. Beastmen, as the product of ancient sorcery that crossed humans with animals and monsters, are typically Chaotic. Some, such as centaurs, have escaped the taint of Chaos, but being unnatural and monstrous they are almost never Lawful.
3. Enchanted creatures and monstrosities may be of any alignment. If sapient, their alignment will vary based on their ethical beliefs and innate dispositions. If of bestial or mindless intelligence, they are typically Neutral, but it is not uncommon for them to be Lawful or Chaotic. The magical nature and sorcerous origin of enchanted and monstrosities might cause them to serve Law or Chaos in a brute manner. Wyverns are an example of Chaotic monstrosities of animal intelligence.
4. Humanoids and giant humanoids may be of any alignment, depending on their ethical beliefs and innate disposition. Thus, Dwarves are Lawful, Elves are Neutral, and Morlocks are Chaotic. Individual members of these species may, of course, vary from the typical alignment of their kind.
5. Oozes and vermin, though disgusting and destructive, are nevertheless typically Neutral. Particularly horrific monsters of these types, created with dark sorcery, might be Chaotic. Giant scorpions, which are said to have been born from the blood of a Chaotic demigod, are an example of Chaotic vermin.
6. Incarnations may be either Lawful, Neutral or Chaotic, depending on their disposition. Herald Angels are an example of Lawful incarnations, while Efreeti are Chaotic incarnations.
7. Undead are always Chaotic.

These alignment restrictions by type and intelligence are summarized on the Monster Alignment table. As always, you are the final arbiter of your monster’s characteristics and can overrule these restrictions if desired.

## Monster Parts (Spoils)

Most monsters should be assigned special components with a total gp value equal to their XP value. The Monster Parts (Special) section explains how to determine the nature and value of special components.

It’s up to you if you want your monster to have mundane monster parts of value, such as feathers, horns, or pelts. If so, use the values in the Monster Parts (Mundane) section as benchmarks and assign something reasonable to your monster.

## Monster Taming and Training Characteristics

The Monster Taming and Training Characteristics table (p. XX) introduces several new characteristics for monsters, including lifespan, supply cost, trained value, untrained adult value, child value, and baby value. While not strictly necessary, these characteristics can be useful to know in campaign play.

### Monster Lifespan

The age categories that constitute a monster’s lifespan are calculated by working backwards from the monster’s maximum age. Three methods are available to compute maximum lifespan for a new monster:

First, there is a known correlation between a creature’s full-grown weight and its maximum lifespan. Starting with the new monster’s weight in pounds (calculated on p. XX), its maximum lifespan in years will approximate 10.14 x (Monster Weight/2.2)0.18. This formula is most accurate for common mammals. Monsters with high brain mass (intelligence) will tend to live longer than this formula indicates, as will birds and reptiles.

Second, if the new monster is very similar to an existing creature with a known lifespan and weight, the new monster’s lifespan in years can be calculated as a ratio of that baseline. The formula is New Monster Maximum Lifespan = Baseline Monster Lifespan x (New Monster Weight/Baseline Monster Weight)0.25

Third, if the new monster is based on a real-world creature, or a creature from myth and legend, that has a known or reputed lifespan, that value can simply be used. Powerful monsters with many special abilities should usually be given a very long life span, as this helps rationalize in-world why they are not bred in captivity at a wide scale.

Once the monster’s maximum lifespan is known, its other age categories can be calculated using the table below. These percentages are based on averages across all monsters in the ***ACKS II MM***so many monsters vary from these proportions. If desired, you can set the monster’s age categories by hand, or model them on a similar monster’s age categories.

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Baby | Juvenile | Adolescent | Adult | Middle-Aged | Old | Ancient |
| 0% Of Maximum | 1% Maximum | 5% Maximum | 10% Maximum | 40% Maximum | 60% Maximum | 80% Maximum |

EXAMPLE: The crawling horror is a 10 HD monster with the scolopendrine body form, weighing 1,100 lbs. The Judge calculates that his monster has a weight-based maximum lifespan of [10.14 x (1,100/2.2)0.18] = 31 years. Since Scolopendrine monsters are essentially giant centipedes, he looks up the maximum lifespan and weight of a centipede on the internet. He finds that centipedes live a surprisingly-long 5 years despite weighing just 140 milligrams (0.0003 lbs). Using that as a baseline, he determines that the maximum lifespan of his 10 HD monster will be (5 years) x (1,100 lbs / 0.0003 lbs)0.25 = 219 years. He chooses to use the latter value, rounded to 220 years. From there, he calculates the monster’s lifespan as 0/2/11/22/88/132/176/220.

### Trained Value and Battle Rating

The trained value is, in most cases, calculated from its battle rating (BR), with various adjustments applied if the monster requires expensive supplies or handlers. ***Domains at War: Battles***, available separately,includes detailed rules on how to calculate a monster’s BR, monthly wage, and value. Judges without access to ***Domains at War: Battles****,* or who simply prefer to avoid the complex calculations therein, can use the following simplified formulas to estimate trained value and BR:

* Trained Value = (Creature’s AC/2+1) x (Creature’s HD) x (Creature’s average damage/2) x (1 + Creature’s # of special abilities) x 24
* BR = Trained Value / 24,000

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Characteristic | Special Multiplier |
| Monster is bestial or mindless and not a mount | x0.5 |
| Monster can fly at speed of 240’ or less | x2 |
| Monster can fly at speed more than 240’ | x4 |
| Monster can carry riders weighing 20 st. or more | x2\* |
| \*Bonus does not increase BR | |

Only special abilities that warrant an asterisk (\*) count for these purposes. Before calculating BR, apply any applicable special multipliers from the adjoining table. Round calculated values of 10,000gp or less to the nearest 100gp, and larger values to the nearest 250gp.

EXAMPLE #1: A giant acanthaspis has AC 8, 5 HD, deals an average of 10 damage, and has 2 special abilities. It’s of bestial intelligence. Therefore the trained value is (8/2 +1) x (5) x (10/2) x (1 + 2) x 24 = 9,000gp. Because it’s of bestial intelligence, its estimated trained value is halved to 4,500gp. Its estimated BR is 4,500 / 24,000 = 0.1875. In comparison, the official values for a giant acanthaspis are 4,235gp and 0.236 respectively.

EXAMPLE #2: A small roc has AC 5, HD 6, deals an average of 14 damage, and has 1 special ability. It’s of sapient intelligence. It can fly at 480’ carrying a rider weighing 20 st. or more. Therefore the trained value is (5/2 +1) x (6) x (14/2) x (1 +1) x 24 = 7,056gp. Because it can fly at 480’ carrying a rider, its estimated value is then multiplied by x8 to 56,448, rounded to 56,500gp. However, its BR is calculated as [ (56,500 / 2) / 24,000] = 1.177. In comparison, the official values are 65,000gp and 1.288 respectively.

Trained values estimated using the formula above will not always be so close to the value derived using *Domains at War: Battles.* Monsters with exceptional HD, special abilities, spellcasting, or other characteristics can vary greatly, so use common sense when making the estimate. In addition, some monsters have such unusual abilities that their value is driven by other factors.

### Untrained Values

The untrained adult, juvenile, and child values in the ***ACKS II MM*** were calculated with a robust spreadsheet that takes into account the net present value of money based on the monster’s ages, the changing cost of food as the monster grows, the cost to train the monster, and more. (If there is interest within the *ACKS* community we may work to develop an online calculator for our Judges.) The following paragraphs offer suggestions on how to estimate these values.

To estimate the untrained adult values of a monster, start by checking if it is sapient or not. If the monster is sapient, its untrained adult value will be the greater of the monster’s normal load x 8gp or the value of the monster’s spoils. If the monster is not sapient, its untrained value will be the greater of its trained value less the cost to train it, its normal load x 4gp, or its spoils value. Across all monsters in the ***ACKS II MM***, the untrained value of monsters averages around 10% its trained value.

To estimate the untrained juvenile and baby values of a monster, benchmark it against a creature with a similar diet, size, and lifecycle. If all else fails, go with an average -- across all monsters in the ***ACKS II MM***, the juvenile and baby values of a monster average around 40% and 20% of its untrained value or 4% and 2% of its trained value, respectively.

## Monster Treasure Type

Determine the monster’s **average treasure value** by multiplying 4 times the XP value of one monster times the average number of monsters encountered in its dungeon lair. (If the monster has no dungeon lair, use its wilderness lair.)

Average Treasure Value = 4 x Monster XP Value x Average Number Encountered

Next decide whether the monster accumulates treasure by hoarding, by raiding, by accident, or not at all. Consult the **Monster Treasure Type** table, below, cross referencing its average treasure value with its method of treasure accumulation to find its treasure type(s). Adjust the treasure value up or down by one or more rows if the monster should have more or less treasure than usual for its HD.

| --- | --- | --- | --- |

### Treasure Accumulation by Monster Type

In designing the monsters presented in this book, each monster’s type was used to guide the treasure type allocated to it.

* Animals generally do not accumulate treasure at all, and are assigned a treasure type of “none.” However, animals that are semi-sapient, swallow creatures whole, or so formidable that they are on par with monstrosities have been assigned incidental treasure types.
* Beastmen accumulate treasure by raiding.
* Constructs accumulate treasure by accident (from slain creatures that have disturbed them) or unwittingly (it having been placed there by their creator). Constructs have been assigned incidental treasure types.
* Dragons accumulate treasure by hoarding.
* Monstrosities of bestial intelligence and vermin generally accumulate treasure by accident, and have been assigned incidental treasure types. Semi-sapient bestial monstrosities might have any treasure type depending on their behaviors.
* Monstrosities and undead of sapient intelligence, as well as all giants and humanoids, accumulate treasure by either hoarding or raiding.
* Oozes generally do not accumulate treasure and are assigned a treasure type of “none.” Occasionally a particular ooze (such as a gelatinous mass) might end up carrying treasure with it, and be given an incidental treasure type.

### Treasure from Spoils and Offspring

Some monsters have very valuable spoils, such as valuable antlers, hides, horns, or eggs. The fact that adventurers can transport these spoils back to civilization to earn XP suggests the spoils should be counted against each monster’s treasure. However, transporting spoils over long distances is difficult, and the spoils themselves are often expensive to store and hard to sell. These facts suggest that spoils should not be counted against each monster’s treasure. In designing the monsters presented in this book, we have generally treated spoils as being treasure worth half their value.

## Sample Monster Creation

The following example walks through the creation of a monster from scratch, following each step in order:

1. Perusing the *ACKS* rulebook, the Judge has noticed that many of the monsters, such as the griffon and wyvern, were commonly used in medieval heraldry. But one of his favorite heraldic creatures, the double-headed imperial eagle of the Byzantine Empire and Holy Roman Empire, is missing! The Judge decides to create a double-headed eagle, sacred bird of a powerful empire in his campaign.
2. The double-headed eagle, being an animal with an impossible combination of body parts, is clearly a monstrosity.
3. The griffon and wyvern are both 7 HD creatures. Since the double-headed eagle is rarer than those monsters, and used as a symbol of empire, he makes it a slightly more powerful 8 HD monster.
4. As an 8 HD monstrosity, the double-headed eagle saves as a Fighter of level (HD/4 x 1d8). The Judge rolls a 4, so the double-headed eagle will save as an 8th level Fighter.
5. Because his monster is modeled after an eagle, the Judge chooses the aquiline body form.
6. As an aquiline, the double-headed eagle can have a body mass exponent (BME) of 1.63 to 1.67. The Judge wants his eagle to look powerful but not oversized, so he selects a mid-range value of 1.65. The double-headed eagle’s weight, according to the formula (HD x 10)BME, is 1,380 lbs.
7. With a weight of 1,380 lbs, the double-headed eagle falls within the Large size category. The Judge decides it will be 10’ long with a 40’ wingspan. It has a -1 penalty to AC because of its size.
8. Now it’s time to calculate the double-headed eagle’s normal load. The formula for normal load is (weight x carrying capacity factor). As an aquiline, the double-headed eagle can have a carrying capacity factor (CCF) of 0.050. The double-headed eagle has a normal load of (1,380 x 0.050) 69 stone. This seems reasonable, as it is between the normal load of a 6 HD roc (40 stone) and a 12 HD roc (150 stone).
9. Next the Judge calculates the double-headed eagle’s AC. The formula for monster AC is (0.8 x HD), rounding to the nearest whole number. Therefore the double-headed eagle has an AC of (8 x 0.8) 6.4, rounded to 6. As an aquiline, it gains a +1 bonus to AC. As a large monster, it suffers a -1 penalty to AC. Its final AC is (6 +1 – 1) 6.
10. An aquiline’s natural attacks are 2 talons and 1 bite. The Judge knows he wants the double-headed eagle to be able to bite with both its heads, but the second bite will be added later, during special abilities.
11. The average damage dealt by each of the double-headed eagle’s attack sequences should be around (8 x 2) 16 points. Looking at the monster attack table, he notes that an 8 HD talon attack has a recommended damage of 2d8 points. If the eagle’s attack sequence included those two talons, its average damage would be (9 + 9) 18 points per round – already over the recommended 16 points, and leaving nothing for the bite attack. Since his concept called for the eagle to have a bite attack, the Judge opts for 2 talons dealing 2d4 points of damage each and 1 bite dealing 2d6 points of damage.
12. As an aquiline, the double-headed eagle can have a flying speed of 450’ to 480’. The Judge chooses the slower speed, 450’, since he envisions the eagle as big and burly rather than sleek and fast.
13. It’s time to assign special abilities to the double-headed eagle. Since the double-headed eagle is a monstrosity, the Judge rolls 2d6-7 for its special abilities. The result is a 10, so the monster has 3 special abilities. The Judge has already picked two special abilities he wants the double-headed eagle to have, so there’s no need to make a random roll for them. The first ability he chooses is bonus attack, giving the eagle an additional bite dealing 2d6 points of damage. The second ability he chooses is flying. Since the double-headed eagle can already fly, it becomes capable of dive attacks instead. The Judge decides to roll for the third special ability. The d100 roll yields a 15, Dreadful. Dreadful is a major ability (\*) while bonus attack and flying are both minor abilities (## and ####, respectively). Adding the number of # from all minor abilities divided by 8 yields 0.75; adding 0.75 to the number of \* from major abilities results in a total of 1.75, which rounds to 2. Therefore the Judge notes that the double-headed eagle is an 8\*\* HD creature.
14. The Judge has to choose the double-headed eagle’s morale score. Since the eagle is famous for its regal pride and nobility, he decides the double-headed eagle has a morale score of +2.
15. Now the Judge calculates the double-headed eagle’s XP value. On the Monster Experience table, the base XP value for its Hit Dice is 600, while the value per XP bonus is 500. The double-headed eagle is therefore worth [600 + (2 x 500)] 1,600 XP. It will have special components worth 1,600gp, as well.
16. After reviewing the Monster Organization table for aquiline body forms, the Judge decides that the double-headed eagle is only encountered in the wilderness. Its organization is flight (1d8) when encountered away from its lair, and aerie (1d10) in its wilderness lair.
17. As a monstrosity, the double-headed eagle can possess either animal or sapient intelligence. Since he’s already determined that the double-headed eagle collects treasure, the Judge decides it’s of sapient intelligence.
18. A sapient monstrosity can be of any alignment. Since the double-headed eagle is the sacred bird of a powerful empire in his campaign, the Judge decides it should be of Lawful alignment. Lawful creatures represent the forces of civilization and order.
19. Since it is worth 1,600 XP, the double-headed eagle has special components with a 1,600gp value. The Judge also decides it has 6d10 flight feathers that each fetch 7d6gp and weigh 1/4 st. The average value of its spoils is (1,600gp) + (6 x 5.5 x 7 x 3.5gp) = 2,408gp.
20. The Judge decides to calculate the double-headed eagle’s taming and training characteristics. These include its lifespan, trained value, untrained adult value, child value, and baby value.
    1. The Judge decides to calculate the double-headed eagle’s lifespan using the real-world golden eagle as a baseline. A golden eagle has a maximum lifespan of 30 years and a weight of 11 lbs. The double-headed eagle therefore has a maximum lifespan of 30 years x (1,380 lbs/11 lbs)0.25 = 100 years. This gives it lifespan age categories of 0/1/5/10/40/60/80/100.
    2. The double-headed eagle’s trained value is equal to (AC/2+1) x (HD) x (average damage) x (1 + # of Special Abilities) x 24. Its trained value is (7/2+1) x (8) x (16) x (1 + 2) x 24 = 41,472. This is increased by eightfold because of its flight speed and carrying capacity, to 331,776gp, rounding to 332,000gp. In comparison, a large roc is worth 400,000gp.
    3. The double-headed eagle’s battle rating is equal to (332,000gp / 2 ) / 24,000 = 6.91. That is about 1 point higher than the BR of a large roc (6.108).
    4. The double-headed eagle’s untrained adult value is the greater of its normal load x 8gp or its spoils of 2,408gp. Therefore its untrained adult value is 2,408gp. This is again comparable to, but less valuable than, the large roc (2,900gp).
    5. The Judge calculates the double-headed eagle’s juvenile value as 4% of its trained value, or 13,280gp. He calculates the double-headed eagle’s baby value as 2% of its trained value, or 6,640gp.
21. The Judge decides that, like dragons, double-headed eagles collect treasure. That makes it a hoarder. There will be an average of 5.5 double-headed eagles in a lair, so their average treasure value is (1,600 XP) x (4 x 5.5) 35,200. Cross-referencing the average treasure value (35,200) with the hoarder type on the Monster Treasure table, the Judge sees that the double-headed eagle has treasure type Q, N, H, D.
22. At this point, all of the calculations to create the double-headed eagle are finished! The Judge reviews its characteristics and turns to crafting a write-up of the monster.
