# Introduction

*It is an age when empires totter on the brink of war, and terrible monsters tear at the fragile borderlands of men; when decaying cities teem with chaos and corruption, where nubile maidens are sacrificed to chthonic cults and nobles live in decadent pleasure on the toil of slaves; when heroes, wizards, and rogues risk everything in pursuit of glory, fortune, and power. These are days when adventurers can become conquerors… and conquerors can become kings!*

## About the Game

The ***Adventurer Conqueror King System*** (***ACKS***)is a set of rules for role-playing in a world of swords, sorcery, and strongholds, where you take on the role of an adventurer in an imaginary land drawn from the epics and legends of the past. The core rules for ***ACKS***were first published in 2012. This book, the ***Adventurer Conqueror King System Imperial Imprint***(***ACKS II***)***Revised Rulebook***, is a revised and expanded edition of the original core rules. The ***ACKS II Revised Rulebook***provides a complete toolkit for enjoying a wide variety of heroic fantasy settings. It covers character creation, proficiencies, spells, adventures, encounters, and combat, and all the associated game mechanics necessary for swords-and-sorcery adventure.

For those who prefer a pre-generated world for their gaming, the ***ACKS II Revised Rulebook***also provides the default setting of the **Auran Empire**, an ancient and opulent land drowning in a torrent of violence from all sides. Primeval wars and wild magic have left behind terrible monsters that, in this declining age, can no longer easily be held in check. Confronted by the imminent collapse of the once-great empire, you may be a scavenger and vagabond feasting off its corpse, a hero fighting to save what you can, or a would-be conqueror intent on forging a new kingdom from the ashes of the old.

Whatever setting your adventures inhabit, with ***ACKS II***you can seek fame, wealth, and power by conquering foes, gathering treasure, and accumulating land and followers. If you are skilled and lucky, you may rise to become a mighty overlord, wizard-king, or theocrat, holding the destiny of thousands in your hands. If not, the wages of your adventures will be merely death…

## The Basics of The Game

Read this section carefully! These terms will be used throughout the rules of the ***Adventurer Conqueror King System***.

When a group of people sit down to play ***ACKS****,* the participants are called **players**, and they each take on the role of a **character** (or, sometimes, more than one character). Characters played by players are referred to as **player characters** or **adventurers**. The players act in the role of their characters in the world designed and presented by a special game participant referred to as the **Game** **Judge** (or **Judge** for short)**.** It’s the Judge’s responsibility to prepare ahead of time to give the players opportunities for adventure, and to judge the results of their choices during adventures fairly and wisely. The Judge is the referee of the game, and the final arbitrator of rules and rules decisions. He also narrates the action of the game, and plays the roles of all the various **monsters** in the world. A special type of monster is the **non-player character (NPC)**. NPCs share many similarities with the characters played by the players, but the Judge determines their actions, personalities, and motivations. PCs, NPCs, and other monsters are collectively called **creatures.**

Characters have **attributes**,which determine how strong, smart, and otherwise talented they are. Based on their attributes, characters each will select a **class**, such as fighter or mage, which might be thought of as a profession, and which dictates what sorts of training and capabilities characters can develop, including their unique **class powers** and trained **proficiencies**. Characters have levels of experience, or **class levels**, which measure how well-developed and powerful they are. Player characters begin at 1st level in a particular class. Normal people, lacking the call to adventure, are generally 0th level characters. Spellcasters have **caster levels** that determine how effective their magic is. Caster level is usually, but not always, equal to class level.

**Experience points (XP)** are used to measure the advancement of characters through their class levels. These points are earned based partly on how powerful defeated monsters are, but mostly on how much treasure is found and returned to civilization by the player characters. As characters accumulate experience points through fighting monsters and gaining wealth, they will reach higher levels (2nd level, 3rd level, and so on). Gaining a level incrementally marks your character’s advancement. As a character gains levels, he becomes ever more powerful.

Monsters also have levels, called **monster levels**,whichare a direct measure of how challenging an opponent the monster is. Likewise, **spell levels** measure how powerful a spell is. Monster and spell levels do not directly correspond to class levels; they are only a relative measure of power.

When a character advances in level, he gains additional **hit points** **(hp),** which allow him to endure more damage and survive. Characters most often take damage from monsters while engaged in an **encounter**. An encounter is a situation in which the PCs and monsters are interacting. Time and movement are measured in detail during encounters, with actions resolved in a precise order known as **initiative**.

A series of encounters connected by time, location, and player choices is called an **adventure**. An adventure is often used to describe one play session, but it might also indicate a complete **scenario** that is played out over several sessions. A series of adventures in the same game world is referred to as a **campaign**.

Early in their career, adventurers will delve into **dungeons**,underground complexes that are stocked with many monsters, treasures, and treacherous secrets. Dungeons can be as small as a monster den or as large as an underground city. While the Judge may design these areas, published pre-made dungeons might also be used. Dungeons are divided into **dungeon levels**. A dungeon level could be thought of as a floor of a building. When characters travel into the top-most level of a dungeon, they are in the level closest to the surface of the earth. If the dungeon has multiple levels, the next level down is the second level, then the third, and so on. The deeper the dungeon level, the greater the dangers that await the characters.

If an adventurer is not slain or otherwise removed from play, he will eventually reach a high level. At this time, adventurers often begin to buy, construct, or conquer **strongholds**, such as castles or towers. Strongholds enable a character to attract **followers** and open up new campaign activities and new avenues of gameplay. Some types of strongholds enable adventurers to establish criminal syndicates, monster-filled dungeons, or hidden fastnesses. Other types enable adventurers to establish **domains** over which they exert sovereign control. With careful play, an adventurer may establish or conquer multiple domains and ultimately establish himself as ruler of a **realm**.Becoming the ruler of a vast realm is the ultimate goal of many adventurers in ***Adventurer Conqueror King*** campaigns.

## Dice

The ***Adventurer Conqueror King System*** relies on six different polyhedral dice to add randomness to the results of the choices the players make in the game. The six types of dice are described below.

The 20-sided die, or d20, is one of the most important dice in the game: it is used to resolve all attack and saving throws. As explained later, when making a throw, the die is rolled, and modifiers are then added or subtracted. If the total result equals or exceeds an assigned value, the roll is a success; otherwise it has failed.

The 10-sided die, or d10, is used to generate numbers from 1 to 10; it is numbered 0 to 9, but a roll of 0 is counted as 10. A pair of d10s are also used together to generate numbers from 1 to 100, where a roll of 00 is counted as 100. The two dice should be different colors, and the player must declare which die is the tens digit and which die is the ones digit before rolling them! Rolling two d10s this way is called a percentile roll, or d100.

The 4-sided die, or d4, is a special case. It is not so much rolled as “flipped,” and the number which is upright (or for some d4s, lies along the bottom edge of the die) is the result of the roll.

The other dice normally used have 6, 8, and 12 sides, and are called d6, d8, and d12. A d6 may be made with either numbers or pips; it makes no difference which sort you choose.

When multiple dice are to be rolled and added together, it is noted in the text like this: 2d6 (roll two d6 dice and add them together), or 3d4 (roll three d4 dice and add them together). A modifier may be noted as a “plus” value, such as 2d8+2 (roll two d8 dice and add them together, then add two to the total).

Sometimes an exclamation point is appended, as in 1d10! or similar. The “!” in this expression indicates that this is an exploding roll. On any exploding roll, any die that rolls its maximum value should be rolled again, with the new result added to the total. Repeat the process if the maximum value is subsequently rolled.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Notation** | **Meaning** |
| d2 | Two-sided die, implicitly rolled with 1d6, treating 1 – 3 as 1 and 4 – 6 as 2. |
| d3 | Three-sided die, implicitly rolled with 1d6, treating 1 – 2 as 1, 3 – 4 as 2, and 5 – 6 as 3. |
| d4 | Four-sided die. |
| d6 | Six-sided die. |
| d8 | Eight-sided die. |
| d10 | Ten-sided die, where “0” indicates a 10. |
| d12 | Twelve-sided die. |
| d20 | Twenty-sided die. |
| d100 | Percentile dice, where a number between 1 and 100 is generated by rolling two different ten-sided dice. One, designated before rolling, is the tens digit. The other is the ones digit. A roll of 00 indicates the maximum result of 100. |

## Rolling and Throwing the Dice

The ***Adventurer Conqueror King System***has a variety of different systems and sub-systems that determine how situations are resolved. All of these various sub-systems rely on generating a randomized outcome by using dice.

###### Rolling the Dice

During the course of play, many situations will arise in which there are a range of possible outcomes. The players or Judge will make a **roll of the dice** to see which of the possible outcomes occurs. Thus, when a character meets a monster during an encounter, the Judge will make a **surprise roll** to see if either or both sides are caught off guard and a **reaction roll** to see how the monster reacts to the character, with results ranging from friendly to hostile.

Likewise, when a character is in combat, the player will make an **initiative roll** to determine when he gets to act, with results ranging from last to first. When a character hits an opponent, the player will make a **damage roll** to determine how many hit points his target loses. When monsters begin to lose a battle, they will make a **morale roll** to determine if they flee, surrender, or stay and fight.

To make a roll of the dice, you follow these steps:

* Roll the appropriate die for the given situation.
* Add any relevant modifiers to the number generated by the die.
* Apply the total as required by the given situation.

Sometimes a roll may automatically succeed or fail if the minimum or maximum value is rolled on the die. Sometimes a roll will be applied for an absolute result. For example, a damage roll is applied directly against the hit points of the target hit. Other rolls are relative to each other. For example, a character’s initiative roll is compared against the initiative rolls of other characters to determine who goes first during combat. An initiative roll of 6 has no absolute meaning other than being faster than an initiative roll of 5. Other rolls are compared to a table.

###### Throwing the Dice

One very common type of die roll is called a **throw.** A throw occurs whenever a character or monster is taking an action that will **succeed or fail**.For instance, when a character attempts to strike an opponent in combat, his player makes an **attack throw.** When a character tries to avoid a catastrophic event, his player makes a **saving throw.** When a character attempts to open a lock or bash down a door, his player makes a **proficiency throw.** Most throws are resolved with 1d20.

To make a throw of the dice, you follow these steps:

* Throw the appropriate die for the action chosen.
* Add any relevant modifiers to the number generated by the die.
* Compare the total to a **target value** for the action, usually expressed as #+ (such as 11+).

If the total equals or exceeds the target value, the outcome is favorable to the character. If the result is lower than the target value, the outcome is unfavorable to the character. The value required to succeed at different throws is usually based on the character’s class and level. For instance, fighters have easier attack throws than other characters, while thieves have easier proficiency throws to sneak around.

EXAMPLE: Marcus has an attack throw value of 6+. When he makes an attack throw, he will roll 1d20, add any relevant modifiers to the die, and compare the total to his attack throw value. If it equals or exceeds 6, he will hit.

If a particular throw is subject to a modifier that will always apply, it is often easier to record this modifier as an adjustment to the target value for the throw. Bonuses reduce the target value required, while penalties increase the target value required.

EXAMPLE: Viktir has a Lockpicking proficiency throw of 16+. However, he has a Lockpicking Expertise proficiency that gives him a +2 bonus to picking locks. For ease of play, Viktir can record his Lockpicking proficiency throw as 14+, applying the +2 bonus as a 2-point reduction in the target value instead of modifying the die roll. Throwing the die and aiming for 14+ is mathematically identical to throwing the die with a +2 bonus and aiming for 16+.

**Automatic Success and Failure:** Unless otherwise noted, a roll of 1 on a throw automatically fails. (Some throws may have a wider range of automatic failure.) A roll of 20 on a throw automatically succeeds if the character making the throw is proficient in the task at hand. Non-proficient characters who just “roll the die and pray” do not automatically succeed on a 20.

**Botches and Crits:** Some throws may allow for special effects to occur if particular results are rolled on the die. For instance, a thief who rolls a 1 when attempting a proficiency throw to disarm a trap not only automatically fails, he triggers the trap as well. These rules are provided on a case-by-case basis for each throw. A low roll that triggers a special effect is called a **botch** and a high roll that triggers a special effect is called a **crit**.

###### What Kind of Die Should You Use?

The kind of die used for the various rolls depends on the riskiness and randomness of the situation a character is facing. The rules will detail which die is used in each situation; below is a general explanation that will help frame the rules to come.

In general, situations where the outcome is strongly influenced by both skill and fortune are resolved by using a twenty-sided die (1d20). Most throws use 1d20, with the usual target value for the throw being in the range of 10 to 20. When throwing 1d20, a modifier such as +2 or -3 has a significant but not overpowering impact on the outcome.

Sometimes, the outcome of a situation will be heavily influenced by factors of skill or innate ability, with less scope for random chance. These situations are usually resolved by throwing or rolling a six-sided die (1d6). Surprise rolls, initiative rolls and many damage rolls use d6s. With a range of numbers of just 1 – 6, a modifier such as +2 or -3 makes a very big difference.

Where a wide range of outcomes is possible, but some are much more probable than others, a roll of two six-sided dice (2d6) is used. A roll of 2d6 will generate a bell curve with common results centered on 6 – 8, and rare outcomes at 2 – 3 and 11 – 12. Reaction rolls and morale rolls both use 2d6. Monsters will generally react cautiously to adventurers, and generally stay and fight with moderate resolve, but might occasionally be very friendly or very hostile, fight to the death or flee in terror.

# Chapter 1: Characters

## Creating a Character

You’ve taken the first step on your adventure, but you are still a 0th level human. Don’t despair, because you become 1st level when you create your first character, and progress from there! To create a character, follow the eleven steps below:

1. Break out a new character sheet. You can use the one provided in this book, download and print one of the many fan-made character sheets, or reproduce an existing sheet by hand on a piece of paper. If all else fails, just scribble down notes on scratch paper!
2. Roll for your character’s **attributes**, as described below in **Character Attributes**. Write the results after the names of the abilities and record the attribute bonus or penalty for each score. (Some campaigns might use optional rules that change how attributes are rolled. Your Judge will let you know if so.)
3. Choose a **character** **class** which suits your character’s abilities from this chapter in the **Character Classes** section. All classes have key attributes (requiring a minimum score of 9), and some classes require that the character have minimum scores for other attributes. Write down the combat characteristics and class powers of your class. Note that, unlike some games, in ***ACKS***a character’s race is part of his class; you do not separately choose a race.
4. Note on your character sheet that your character has zero (0) **experience points** (or **XP**); you might also want to note the number needed to advance to second level, as shown in the table for your class. Gaining experience points is explained in the **Adventures** and **Campaigns** chapters.
5. Roll **hit points** (**hp**)using the designated die for your class. If you roll 4 or less, treat the result as a 4. Add your Constitution bonus or penalty to the roll and note the result as your hit points on your character sheet. (Some campaigns might use optional rules that change starting hp. Your Judge will let you know if so.)
6. Find the appropriate template table for your character’s class,and roll 3d6 on the table to determine your character’s starting **template**. If you don’t like the template you rolled, you can choose a template from a lower roll, but not from a higher roll. Write down the name of the template you settle on.
7. Write down your character’s starting **proficiencies** as listed for your template. All characters always begin with the Adventuring proficiency in addition to those listed. Apply any modifiers to your attributes, hit points, attack throws, or saving throws from proficiencies. Write down your character’s proficiency throws.
8. If you have chosen to play a caster, write down your repertoire of starting **spells** from your template. If you aren’t playing a spellcaster, skip this step.
9. Write your character’s **starting equipment** and gold pieces as listed for your template. Since you now know what armor your character is wearing, what your Dexterity modifier is, and what powers and proficiencies modify your defenses, you can calculate and note your **Armor Class** (**AC**) on the character sheet. Calculate your character’s **encumbrance** based on how much weight he is carrying and use that to determine his four **speeds** (p. XX).
10. Decide your character’s **homeland** and whether your character is male or female. (In the Auran Empire campaign setting, some classes are restricted to certain sexes.) Roll for your character’s **starting age** and write down your character’s starting **languages** based on your race. Record your character’s size (**man-sized**) and weight (usually **15 stone**).
11. Give your character a name, and create a brief summary of your character’s appearance, background, and personality based on his attributes, class, template, age, and other characteristics. Choose an appropriate **alignment** for your character. Your Judge will have information on the setting of your character’s world that can be helpful in naming your new character and developing his background. He can also advise you on how the characters are coming together to form an **adventuring party**.

### Optional Rules for Character Creation

Depending on the Judge’s preferences, either or both of the following optional rules might apply.

###### Generating Characters without Templates (Optional)

Instead of rolling 3d6 to determine a template, roll 3d6 x 10 to determine your character’s starting gold pieces. Use the gold to select any weapons, armor, and equipment that the Judge says are available. Select your starting proficiencies and (if a caster) starting spells, subject to the Judge’s discretion. This rule is only recommended for experienced players.

###### Generating Multiple Characters (Optional)

At the start of play, each player generates five characters and selects one primary and two back-up characters. The remaining two characters are given to the Judge to use as NPCs to populate the campaign setting. If the primary and back-ups are all killed, the player generates five additional characters, again picking three and giving the Judge two**.** This ensures that the player always has a variety of characters to choose from to find one he likes, and gives the Judge some additional NPCs to populate the world.

The ***ACKS II Judges Journal*** has other optional rules for character creation. Be sure to ask your Judge what rules he’s using!

## Character Attributes

Character attributes are determined by rolling randomly. Pick one attribute and roll 5d6; drop the lowest 2 dice and tally the rest. If less than 13, increase to 13. Pick a second and third attribute and roll 4d6 for each; drop the lowest die and tally the rest. If less than 9, increase to 9. Roll 3d6 for each of the remaining three attributes.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Attribute Modifiers** | |
| **Attribute** | **Bonus/Penalty** |
| 3 | -3 |
| 4 – 5 | -2 |
| 6 – 8 | -1 |
| 9 – 12 | 0 |
| 13 – 15 | +1 |
| 16 – 17 | +2 |
| 18 | +3 |

When complete, your character will have a score ranging from 3 to 18 in each of the following abilities. A bonus or penalty is associated with each score, as shown on the table below. Add up those bonuses and penalties; if the sum is less than 0, you can discard the character and re-roll.

**Strength (STR):** As the name implies, this attribute measures the character’s raw physical power. Strength is a key attribute for assassins, barbarians, dwarven vaultguards, elven spellswords, and fighters. Apply the attribute bonus or penalty for Strength to all attack throws and damage rolls in melee combat as well as to damage rolls with thrown weapons (excluding certain splash weapons such as burning oil). Note that a penalty here will not reduce damage from a successful attack below one point, unless the target is otherwise invulnerable to the attack (see the **Adventures** chapter for details). Strength also aids in opening doors, smashing crates, and so on; apply 4x the bonus or penalty to all Dungeonbashing throws, i.e. ±4/8/12.

**Intellect (INT):** This attribute measures learning ability and critical thinking. Intellect is a key attribute for elven nightblades, elven spellswords, mages, Nobiran wonderworkers, and Zaharan ruinguards. The attribute bonus for Intellect is added to the number of general proficiencies the character begins play with (see the **Proficiencies** chapter for details) and the number of languages the character is able to learn to read and write (described below). Studious spellcasters increase the number of spells of each level in their repertoire by their Intellect bonus (see the **Spells** chapter for details).

**Will (WIL):** This attribute measures mental fortitude, whether due to inherent wisdom or faith in a higher power. Will is a key attribute for bladedancers, crusaders, dwarven craftpriests, Nobiran wonderworkers, priestesses, and shamans, who must have the self-discipline to uphold their clerical codes of behavior. The Will bonus or penalty applies to all saving throws.

**Dexterity (DEX):** This attribute measures the character’s agility and reflexes. Dexterity is a key attribute for assassins, bards, bladedancers, elven nightblades, and thieves. A character’s Dexterity bonus or penalty is applied to his attack throws with missile weapons, armor class value, and initiative die rolls.

**Constitution (CON):** Constitution is a combination of general health and vitality. Constitution is a key attribute for barbarians and explorers. Apply the Constitution bonus or penalty to each Hit Die rolled by the character to determine hit points. Note that a penalty here cannot reduce any Hit Die roll to less than 1 point.

**Charisma (CHA):** This attribute measures how well a character can influence or even lead people; those with high Charisma are well-liked, or at least highly respected. Charisma is a key attribute for bards, priestesses, and venturers. Apply the Charisma bonus or penalty to the character’s reaction rolls. Charisma also determines the maximum number of henchmen the character can employ, and modifies their morale and loyalty. The number of henchmen a character can hire is equal to 4 plus the Charisma bonus or penalty (and therefore ranges from 1 to 7); the average morale of any such henchmen will vary with their equipment and experience; the average loyalty of any such henchmen will be 0, modified by the character’s Charisma bonus or penalty.

### Classes and Attributes

Once abilities have been determined, each player must choose a class. Classes are a gestalt of background, profession, and race, which dictates what sorts of training and capabilities characters can develop. All player characters begin at 1st level in a particular class. Normal people, lacking the call to adventure, are generally 0th level characters.

Each class has one or more **key attributes**. A character must have an attribute of at least 9 in a class’s key attribute(s) in order to choose a particular class. Some classes have additional minimum attribute requirements. If so, a character must meet the minimum attribute requirements in order to choose a particular class.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Key Attribute** | |
| **Score** | **Experience Adjustment** |
| 9 – 12 | 0 |
| 13 – 15 | +5% |
| 16 – 18 | +10% |

If a character’s key attribute is high enough, the character will receive a bonus to experience points earned during play. The Key Attribute table details the effect a score in a key attribute has on experience points earned by characters. If a class has two key attributes, calculate the character’s experience adjustment based on whichever key attribute is lower.

## Combat Characteristics

Combat characteristics determine how effective a class is in battle. There are two distinct combat characteristics, **Combat Proficiencies** and **Combat Progression**.

### Combat Proficiencies

Each class has a set of combat proficiencies that determine which weapons it can fight with, in what manner, while wearing which armor.

###### Armor

A class can be proficient in all, heavy, medium, light, or very light armor. Some classes are not proficient in any armor at all. Note that very light armor weighs 1 stone or less; light armor weighs 2 stone; medium armor weighs 3 – 4 stone; and heavy armor weighs 5 stone or more. (Some masterwork or magical armor might actually be less encumbering, but that doesn’t change its type for purposes of armor proficiency.) The **Equipment** chapter on p. XX lists the available types of armor.

###### Weapons

A class can be proficient in all weapons. Most classes, however, are limited in their proficiency with weapons to specific categories, types, and sizes of weapons.

* A class can be proficient in all missile weapons; all tiny, small, and medium melee weapons; and/or all large melee weapons.
* A class can be proficient in all types of axes, all types of bludgeons, all types of bows and crossbows, all types of spears and polearms, and/or all types of swords and daggers.
* A class can be proficient in a list of specific weapons, often those which are traditional to its class or race.

For melee weapons capable of being thrown (such as daggers, hand axes, or spears), weapon proficiency includes the ability to use it as a missile weapon. Note that tiny and small weapons are wielded with just one hand, medium weapons can be wielded with either one or two hands, and large weapons can only be wielded with two hands. The **Equipment** chapter lists the available weapons and their characteristics and costs.

Regardless of class, all characters are considered proficient when throwing bottles, flasks, rocks, sticks, and torches.

###### Fighting Styles

There are five styles of fighting.

* *Missile Weapon:* Fighting while wielding a missile weapon in one, both, or each hand (depending on the weapon).
* *Single Weapon:* Fighting while wielding a single tiny, small, or medium melee weapon.
* *Dual Weapon:* Fighting while wielding a tiny, small, or medium melee weapon in each hand.
* *Two-Handed Weapon:* Fighting while wielding a medium or large melee weapon in both hands.
* *Weapon and Shield:* Fighting while wielding a small, tiny, or medium weapon or missile weapon in one hand and a shield in the other. Classes which lack this style do not gain any benefit from shields.

All classes are proficient in the single weapon and missile weapon styles, which are mandatory when creating a class using the ***ACKS***class building rules. The other three fighting styles are optional. Some classes have proficiency in one or more, and some do not, as noted in their class entries. Note that fighting style proficiency is distinct from weapon proficiency and both are required to avoid the non-proficiency penalty. For instance, the thief class is proficient in the two-handed weapon style, but does not have proficiency in any large melee weapons. Therefore a thief would be proficient fighting two-handed with a sword (a medium weapon) but not with a great axe (a large weapon).

###### Non-Proficient Use of Weapons and Armor

Nothing stops a panicked thief from picking up a great axe in a moment of desperation and swinging it at his foe. Regardless of class limitations, characters of any class can purchase, carry, and use any weapons or armor desired. However, characters of 1st level or higher who equip themselves with weapons and armor unusable by their class attack as 0th level fighters while so equipped. 0th level characters such as mercenaries or militia equipped with weapons and armor with which they are not proficient still fight as 0th level characters, but suffer an additional -1 penalty. Regardless of level, the characters will receive no bonus on their attack throws or armor class from attributes, cannot use any of their class powers, and do not gain XP from adventures in which they were so equipped.

### Combat Progression

As classes advance in level, they become better at fighting and surviving the perils of adventure. A class’s combat progression determines the rate at which its **attack throws** and **saving throws** progress. Fighters improve the most rapidly, while mages improve the least rapidly, with other classes falling in between.

In addition to gaining better attack throws and saving throws, some classes gain **damage bonuses** by level, either with all or some weapons. In addition, some classes gain the ability to **cleave** after killing a foe. The mechanics of cleaving are explained in the **Adventures** chapter (p. XX).

## Class Powers

Class powers are the special abilities that make classes effective within their niche. Some class powers are simply bonus proficiencies that are automatically assigned to every member of the class (such as the fighter’s Manual of Arms class power), but most class powers are unique to the class.

Each class has a mix of Starting and Additional Class Powers. Starting Class Powers are available at 1st level and should be recorded on your character sheet at the start of play. Additional Class Powers will become available as your character ascends to higher levels.

## Hit Points

Hit points (hp) are a measure of a character’s ability to survive in combat. When a character is brought down to 0 or fewer hit points, he is incapacitated and possibly dead. Hit points are not a direct representation of the character’s capacity to receive physical injury. Rather, they represent a holistic combination of fighting skill, stamina, luck, and the favor of the gods, all of which contribute to helping the character roll with blows and survive attacks that would have killed a lesser combatant.

At 1st level, you roll your character’s hit points with one hit die (HD). Each character class rolls a different type of hit die to determine hit points, based on their toughness in battle, as explained in the **Character Classes** section. If you roll 4 or less, treat the result as a 4. Add your Constitution bonus or penalty to the roll and note the result as your hit points on your character sheet.

Thereafter, each time the character gains an additional hit die from leveling, you reroll his hit points using your character’s new number of hit dice, adding his Constitution bonus or penalty to each die rolled. You note the result as your new hit points on your character sheet. If, due to ill luck, your new hit points would be less than or equal to your hit points at your prior level of experience, you just gain 1 hit point. Once you reach 10th level, you no longer gain hit dice or add your Constitution bonus or penalty, you simply gain additional hit points (making 9th level the last level at which you gain a new hit die). Even at 10th level and higher, however, you reroll all hit dice gained up to that point when determining your new hit point total.

### Optional Rules for Determining Hit Points

At the Judge’s discretion, any of the following optional rules can be used to make characters hardier. The Judge can even apply different rules for different classes if desired. For instance, if he wants to encourage players to roll up human characters, he could allow all human classes to start with maximum hit points, but not demi-human classes.

###### Blessed by the Gods (Optional)

Do not roll for your character’s hit points at 1st level. Instead, give your character the maximum hit points he could have rolled, e.g. 8 for fighters, 6 for explorers and crusaders, and 4 for thieves, mages, and venturers, modified by his Constitution.

###### Cursed by the Gods (Optional)

Roll your character’s hit points with one Hit Die. Do not apply any minimums. If you roll a 1, well, good luck.

###### From Ordinary to Extraordinary (Optional)

Before he became an adventurer, your character was just an ordinary 0th-level member of his race. Roll 1d6 hit points to determine his hit points at 0th level. When your character earned his 1st level of experience (prior to play), he might have gained more hit points. Roll the appropriate Hit Die for your class. If the result of the roll is greater than your 0th level hit points, record the new roll. If the roll is less than or equal to your 0th level hit points, you begin play with your 0th level hit points +1.

EXAMPLE: Zach has rolled up Norden, a 1st level dwarven vaultguard. Before Norden became a 1st level dwarven vaultguard, he was just an ordinary 0th-level dwarf. To find out how many hit points he had at that level, Zach rolls 1d6. The result is a 4. Zach now rolls 1d8 for Norden’s hit points at first level. If the result is 1, 2, 3, or 4, Norden starts with his 0th level hit points +1, or 5 hit points. If the result is 5 or more, Norden starts with hit points equal to the result.

## Armor Class

Armor class (AC) is a measure of how challenging it is to damage your character. An unarmored character of average attributes has an AC of 0. AC is determined by what kind of armor the character is wearing and whether he has a shield equipped. AC can be modified by the character’s DEX modifier and certain class powers, proficiencies, conditions, magic items, and spells. After you buy your equipment, calculate your character’s AC and record it on your character sheet.

## Proficiencies

Proficiencies represent particular areas of expertise that your character has developed due to his background, homeland, and training. Each class has a **class** **list** of proficiencies, representing training that is particularly useful to the specific profession. In addition, there is a **general list** of proficiencies, which represent trade skills and knowledge that is widely available to all.

All characters begin with the Adventuring proficiency as well as one proficiency chosen from their class list and one proficiency chosen from the general list. Characters with an Intellect bonus may choose to begin the game knowing one or more additional proficiencies from the general list. During play, characters will learn proficiencies from both lists over time as they advance in level. Each class gains proficiencies at a different rate. See the **Proficiencies** chapter (p. XX) for more details.

### Adventuring Proficiency

The Adventuring proficiency grants your character the ability to do the following defined activities:

* Bash down stuck doors as a combat action by succeeding on a Dungeonbashing proficiency throw of 18+.
* Climb easy-to-scale obstacles such as ropes or branchy trees by succeeding on a Climbing proficiency throw of 8+.
* Methodically search for concealed traps, secret doors, buried treasure, and other hidden features by spending one turn (10 minutes) and succeeding on a Searching proficiency throw of 18+.
* Methodically disarm traps by spending one turn (10 minutes) and succeeding on a Trapbreaking proficiency throw of 18+.
* Pause and listen for noises by spending one round and succeeding on a Listening proficiency throw of 18+.

Write these target values down on your character sheet. Remember to apply 4x your character’s STR bonus or penalty to Dungeon Bashing throws, e.g. you adjust the target value by ±4/8/12. For more information on the Adventuring proficiency, see p. XX.

## Speed and Encumbrance

Characters can move at one of four basic speeds: exploration speed, combat speed, running speed, and expedition speed. (Special types of movement, including climbing, crawling, rappelling, sneaking, swimming, and traversing, are discussed later.)

* **Exploration speed** is measured in feet per turn and represents a pace appropriate to cautious exploration and careful mapping in an area of treacherous ground, shadowy obscurity, and dangerous pitfalls. An unencumbered human has an exploration speed of 120 feet per turn.
* **Combat speed** is measured in feet per round and represents a brief hustle in conditions of danger and distraction. Combat speed is generally used only during encounters or other circumstances where time is tracked in rounds. An unencumbered human has a combat speed of 40 feet per round.
* **Running speed** is measured in feet per round and represents the fastest pace an adventurer can maintain in combat. Characters can only run for brief periods of time before needing rest. An unencumbered human has a running speed of 120 feet per round.
* **Expedition speed** is measured in miles per day and represents the distance which a character travels for each day spent traveling as the party’s dedicated activity. An unencumbered human has an expedition speed of 24 miles per day.

The relationship between the four speeds is shown on the table below.

|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Exploration Speed | Combat Speed | Running Speed | Expedition Speed |  |
| 120 feet per turn | 40 feet per round | 120 feet per round | 24 miles per day |  |
| (Speed) feet per turn | (Speed / 3) feet per round | (Speed) feet per round | (Speed / 5) miles per day |  |

Speed is modified by **encumbrance**. Encumbrance indicates how much equipment and treasure characters are carrying. Encumbrance is important because characters can only carry so much, and if they are heavily weighed down with equipment they cannot carry as much treasure, nor move as fast.

Encumbrance is measured in **stones**. Stonesare an abstract unit of weight for creatures, objects, and other things in the game world. Historically a stone varied from 8 to 14 lbs depending on what was being measured. ***ACKS II***assumes a stone weighs around 10 lbs, but it is left purposefully abstract to represent an amalgam of weight, bulk, and general portability. A typical item like a sword weighs 1/6 stone. A typical man-sized creature weighs 15 stone (abstractly representing anywhere from 120 and 210 lbs). The maximum encumbrance any man-sized character can carry is 20 stone, plus his Strength modifier.

### Calculating Encumbrance

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Item | Encumbrance in Stone |
| Worn clothing | 0 stone |
| Armor | 1 stone per point of AC |
| Shield | 1 stone per shield |
| Typical Item | 1 stone per 6 items |
| Heavy Item | 1 stone or more |
| Treasure | 1 stone per 1,000 coins or gems |

If your character is built using a template, your template will indicate your character’s starting encumbrance. If you are purchasing equipment for your character, you will need to calculate your character’s encumbrance. The Equipment tables will list the amount of encumbrance per item. You can also use the adjoining table to determine the number of stone encumbering your character.

When counting items, each weapon, scroll, potion, vial, wand, magic item, or other object counts as an item. Multiple small items sold as a bundle (such as 12 spikes, 6 torches, 20 arrows, etc.) count as one item for this purpose. Very small single items (such as 1 silver arrow) can be ignored for encumbrance purposes, but if carried in number should be counted as 1 item. (No, a character can’t carry 20 silver arrows and have no encumbrance.)

Heavy items generally include any large melee weapon; any item that is more than two-thirds as tall as the carrying character (including composite bows, long bows, spears, staffs, and 10’ poles); any item that weighs 8 lbs or more; and any item that requires two hands to carry (such as chairs or chests). Items weighing more than 14 lbs will weigh more than 1 stone. Armor weighs 1 stone per point of AC it offers, while simple clothing weighs 0 st.

For purposes of encumbrance, 1,000 coins are considered 1 stone. When a carrying device, such as a backpack, lists the weight it can carry in stone, this weight can be converted at 1:1000 from stone to coins to determine how many coins it can carry.

### Calculating Speed

Once your character’s encumbrance is known, it’s time to calculate his speed. A character’s speed will be affected based on encumbrance, as shown on the Character Speed and Encumbrance table, below. For additional information on movement, see the **Time and Movement** section in the **Adventures** chapter.

|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Character Speed and Encumbrance** | | | |  |
| **Encumbrance** | **Exploration**  **Speed** | **Combat**  **Speed** | **Running**  **Speed** | **Expedition**  **Speed** |
| Up to 5 stone | 120’ per turn | 40’ per round | 120’ per round | 24 miles |
| Up to 7 stone | 90’ per turn | 30’ per round | 90’ per round | 18 miles |
| Up to 10 stone | 60’ per turn | 20’ per round | 60’ per round | 12 miles |
| Up to 20 stone + STR mod | 30’ per turn | 10’ per round | 30’ per round | 6 miles |

EXAMPLE: Marcus is carrying a two-handed sword (1 heavy item), a crossbow (1 item), a mace (1 item), 2 daggers (1 item each), a backpack (1 item), 1 week’s iron rations (1 heavy item), a tinderbox (1 item), 2 flasks of oil (1 item each), a small mirror (1 item), a pound of wolfsbane (1 item), a pound of garlic (1 item), and a case with 20 bolts (1 item). He is carrying 12 items, which counts as 2 stone. His two-handed sword and iron rations, together count as heavy items, add another 2 stone. Finally, he is wearing plate armor (AC 6), which counts as 6 stone. His total encumbrance is 10 stone, so his exploration movement is 60’ per turn. Later, he picks up 8,000 silver pieces. This increases his encumbrance to 18 stone, and reduces his exploration movement to 30’ per turn. His combat speed, running speed, and expedition speed all change when his exploration speed changes.

## Homeland

Every adventurer comes from somewhere*.* A character’s homeland can (but doesn’t have to) be used to inform your choice of name, height, weight, appearance, and other factors. If your Judge is running ***ACKS***using the Auran Empire campaign setting, head to Appendix A (p. XX) and check out the available homelands to pick yours. If your Judge is running ***ACKS***in another campaign setting, check with him to find out his plans.

EXAMPLE: Norden is a vaultguard in the Auran Empire campaign setting. Reading Appendix A, Zach sees that dwarves can hail from either the Jutting Mountains or Meniri Mountains. Zach chooses to make Norden’s homeland the Meniri Mountains. Based on the information found in Appendix A, he describes Norden as having grey-brown eyes, medium brown skin, and wavy chestnut hair and beard.

## Languages

All characters begin the game knowing their native language as well as at least one additional language. Humans in the Auran Empire each know the language of their homeland as well as the vulgarized version of the Classical Auran tongue that is often called “Common.” The demi-human races in and around the Empire each have their own languages, and members of these races normally begin play knowing their racial language, Common (or the local human language if it isn’t called Common), and certain other languages based on the race.

Characters with an Intellect penalty are illiterate and cannot read more than a word or two. Characters with at least average Intellect (9 – 12) will be literate in any languages they can speak. Characters with an Intellect bonus can begin the game knowing one or more languages other than those given above; the number of additional languages that can be learned is equal to the Intellect bonus (+1, +2, or +3). The player can also choose to leave one or more bonus language slots open, to be filled during play.

The languages available to characters include the regional languages (such as Krysean or Somirean in the Auran Empire), demi-human languages (Elven, Dwarven, Gnomish, and Halfling) and the various beastmen dialects (e.g. Orc, Goblin). At the Judge’s discretion, player characters can also begin play knowing ancient or archaic tongues, or exotic languages such as Draconic (the language of dragons). The specific languages available will depend on the campaign setting. In the Auran Empire setting, two important archaic languages are Classical Auran (the predecessor to Common, used for ceremonial, religious, and magical purposes within the empire) and Zaharan (a predecessor to the various beastmen dialects, once used by the fallen Kingdom of Zahar and now remembered by black magicians and necromancers). See Appendix A for an Auran language tree (p. XX).

## Starting Age

Roll on the **Character Starting Age** table to determine the age of your 1st level character. Starting age has no immediate effect on the character, but an ***ACKS***campaign can span many game years of time, during which adventurers can grow old and die. In addition, some monsters and magic can cause premature aging and death.

|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Character Starting Age** | |  |  |  |  |
| **Class** | **Starting Age** | **Class** | **Starting Age** | **Class** | **Starting Age** |
| Assassin | 17 + 1d6 | Elven Nightblade | 75 + 5d4 | Priestess | 17 + 1d6 |
| Barbarian | 17 + 1d6 | Elven Spellsword | 75 + 5d4 | Shaman | 17 + 1d6 |
| Bard | 17 + 1d6 | Explorer | 17 + 1d6 | Thief | 17 + 1d6 |
| Bladedancer | 17 + 1d6 | Fighter | 17 + 1d6 | Venturer | 17 + 2d4 |
| Crusader | 17 + 1d6 | Mage | 17 + 3d6 | Warlock | 17 + 2d6 |
| Dwarven Craftpriest | 25 + 2d8 | Nobiran Wonderworker | 17 + 3d6 | Witch | 17 + 1d6 |
| Dwarven Vaultguard | 23 + 3d4 | Paladin | 17 + 1d6 | Zaharan Ruinguard | 17 + 2d6 |

The **Character Aging** table shows the lifespan of the human, demi-human, and humanoid races, broken into five age categories (Youth, Adult, Middle Aged, Old, and Ancient). Elves and Nobir, being ageless, never progress past adult.

|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Character Aging** | | | | | |
| **Race** | **Youth** | **Adult** | **Middle Aged** | **Old** | **Ancient** |
| Beastman | 12 – 15 | 16 – 30 | 31 – 45 | 46 – 60 | 61 – 75 |
| Dwarf | 15 – 25 | 26 – 50 | 51 – 75 | 76 – 115 | 116 – 150 |
| Elf | 15 – 50 | 51 – 200 | - | - | - |
| Human | 13 – 17 | 18 – 35 | 36 – 55 | 56 – 75 | 76 – 95 |
| Nobiran | 13 – 17 | 18 – 200 | - | - | - |
| Zaharan | 13 – 17 | 18 – 35 | 36 – 55 | 56 – 75 | 76 – 95 |

At each stage, progressively adjust the character’s ability scores as noted on the **Ability Score Adjustments by Age** table. For characters generated at an already advanced age, the cumulative ability score adjustments appropriate to the character’s age can be used. Ability score adjustments from aging cannot reduce an ability score below a class minimum, and in no case lower than 3.

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Ability Score Adjustments by Age** | |  |
| **Age**  **Category** | **Progressive Ability**  **Score Adjustments** | **Cumulative Ability**  **Score Adjustments** |
| Youth | -2 STR, -2 INT, -2 WIL | -2 STR, -2 INT, -2 WIL |
| Adult | +2 STR, +2 INT, +2 WIL | No adjustments |
| Middle Aged | -2 STR, -2 DEX, -2 CON | -2 STR, -2 DEX, -2 CON |
| Old | -2 STR, -2 DEX, -2 CON, -2 CHA | -4 STR, -4 DEX, -4 CON, -2 CHA |
| Ancient | -2 STR, -2 DEX, -2 CON, -2 CHA | -6 STR, -6 DEX, -6 CON, -4 CHA |

### Death from Old Age

Characters can die of old age, though this is a rare fate for adventurers! The chance of death from old age is resolved witha Death saving throw. Characters must make a Death saving throw within 1d12 months of reaching the following ages:

* Racial minimum Old age + character’s Constitution
* Racial minimum Ancient age + character’s Constitution
* Racial maximum listed age, and each year thereafter

EXAMPLE: Marcus has CON 18 as an adult. By the time he reaches the Old age category (56), his CON is reduced to 14. He must save versus Death when he reaches (56 + 14) age 70. He succeeds, so he will not perish due to natural causes just yet. When he reaches the Ancient age category (76), his CON is down to 12. He must save versus Death when he reaches (76 + 12) age 88. He succeeds again. When Marcus reaches age 95, and each year thereafter, he will have to save versus Death again.

Neither **restore life and limb** nor **resurrection** can raise characters who have died from old age. However, a **miracle** or **wish** can do so, bringing the character back to life as an adult.

## Size and Weight

**Size categories** are an abstract measure of a creature’s or object’s overall mass and bulk. In order from smallest to largest: small, man-sized, large, huge, gigantic, colossal. The table below shows the typical range of heights and weights for each size category. All of the playable races in this book are **man-sized**. On your character sheet, you should record your size as man-sized and weight as 15 stone.

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Weight** | **3 stone or less** | **4 to 40 stone** | **41 to 200 stone** | **201 to 800 stone** | **801 to 3200 stone** | **More than 3200 st** |
| **Size Category** | Small | Man-Sized | Large | Huge | Gigantic | Colossal |
| **Length/Height** | Less than 2’ long/tall | 2’ to 8’ long/tall | 8’ to 12’ long/tall | 12’ to 20’ long/tall | 20’ to 32’ long/tall | 32’ or more long/tall |

## Alignment

In the ***Adventurer Conqueror King System***, your character will enter a world of ceaseless violent struggle, where civilization is ever-assailed by forces intent on its destruction. In this perilous realm, he will be called to choose a side: Will he pledge to defend civilization and its allies against those who seek to destroy it? Will he sell his sword to any who can offer fame or fortune? Or will he become an agent of entropy and destruction undermining peace and order? This choice is called **Alignment**, and the three choices are Lawful, Neutral, and Chaotic.

**Law:** Lawful beings believe that civilization is worth fighting for. Despite its vices and villainies, civilization must be defended against those who would destroy it. Lawful beings tend to see wars among civilizations as aiding the cause of Chaos, and so they seek peace among Lawful civilizations where possible. However, Lawful characters are not pacifists, nor are they necessarily altruists. Indeed, most would think something was wrong with a hero who turned down fame and fortune; chests of gold, magnificent weapons, comely consorts, and grants of land are, after all, the rightful rewards for great deeds of valor on behalf of Law.

**Neutrality:** Neutral beings generally enjoy the benefits of law and civilization, but it is not something they directly fight for. They tend to focus on their own ends, whether those are family, fame, fortune, pleasure, or power. A Neutral mercenary might be found fighting on behalf of Law or Chaos; a neutral farmer tends his crops and pays his taxes, whether to the Patriarch or the Lich-King.

**Chaos:** Chaotic beings actively seek to destroy civil society. Chaotic characters are often madmen or cultists of forgotten, chthonic gods. To the extent they have any order at all, societies of Chaotic characters are ruled by force and fear, and are often characterized by all manner of corruption and vice. Even decadent Lawful civilizations at least pay homage to civilizing virtue, but chaotic civilizations embrace their corruption.

Note that a character’s choice of Alignment doesn’t determine whether or not he takes care of his children, cheats on his wife, or steals from the merchant’s guild. It is concerned only with the weighty issue of where his allegiance lies in the grand struggles of existence. To have an alignment of Lawful or Chaotic is to have chosen a side in this perpetual struggle. Many people, choosing no side, are Neutral, although it is important to remember that most Neutrals still want the protection of Law even though they are not willing to die for it. (To paraphrase George Orwell, Neutral humans sleep peaceably in their beds at night only because Lawful heroes stand ready to do violence on their behalf.)

Human vices, such as greed, lust, and vanity, are widespread and common even in Lawful societies. But Chaotic societies are characterized by their monstrous vices: Genocide, human sacrifice, wanton destruction, cannibalism, and so on. Evil is all too human in every civilization, but Chaos is something both less and more than human.

## Adventuring Parties

The worlds of ***Adventurer Conqueror King***are dangerous and hostile. For the sake of survival, characters team up to undertake adventures because any number or type of monsters could lie in wait. Such groups, known as **adventuring** **parties**, are generally composed of a diverse array of classes, so that different characters are able to contribute their specific talents for any given situation. Thieves can search for traps, for instance, and fighters can slay monsters or defend allies. Crusaders have spells for healing and divination, while mages are capable of powerful offensive and defensive magic. Occasionally, there are not enough party members to take on the challenges of an adventure. The party can hire NPCs, such as **henchmen** or **mercenaries**, for extra hands. The rules for hiring henchmen and mercenaries are discussed in Chapter 4, **Equipment**.

## Activities

Throughout the course of playing ***ACKS****,* characters will have the opportunity to undertake many activities, ranging from going on adventures to constructing buildings to running domains to performing magical research.

Activities are divided into **dedicated activities**, **ancillary activities**, and **incidental activities**. Dedicated activities are laborious tasks requiring eight hours to perform. A character who undertakes a dedicated activity is sometimes said to “dedicate the day to that activity.” For instance, “Balbus dedicated the day to magic research” or “the party dedicated the day to travel.”

Ancillary activities are errands or pastimes requiring about one hour (6 turns) to perform. Incidental activities require virtually no time at all. Each game day, an adventurer can undertake one dedicated activity and four ancillary activities or perform up to 12 ancillary activities. A character can perform any reasonable number of incidental activities.

Most campaign activities are **singular** **activities** that take place within a single game day, and can be repeated as often as desired within the limits of available activity.A **restricted activity** takes place within a single day, but cannot be repeated until a certain time period elapses. An **ongoing activity** requires more than one game day to complete, such that the character will have to perform the activity throughout the given time period. Both dedicated and ancillary activities can be ongoing. A **dedicated ongoing activity** represents a period of full-time labor in order to complete a complex project or task. Magical research, for instance, is a dedicated ongoing activity typically requiring days, weeks, or even months. An **ancillary ongoing activity** represents an intermittent effort occurring in short bursts that must be sustained over a lengthy period of time. Managing a subordinate, for instance, typically requires a short period of time every day for as long as the subordinate is employed.

Most campaign activities are **unstrenuous**, but some are **strenuous.** For every six game days of strenuous activity, a character must dedicate one day to **rest**. Characters who do not get the appropriate rest after six game days of strenuous activity become **fatigued** until they have caught up on required rest. (This is why wilderness travel requires rest and recuperation!) Unstrenuous activities do not require rest.

Sometimes adventurers might wish to completely dedicate to an activity, that is, to use both their dedicated activity and some of their ancillary activities that day on the task. This is known as **working overtime** (for most activities) or **force marching** (for travel). A character who is force marching completely dedicates his day to travel and cannot take any ancillary activities, but he increases time spent and distance traveled by up to 50%. Working overtime on an unstrenuous activity makes the activity count as a strenuous activity. Force marching or working overtime on a strenuous activity counts as six days of strenuous activity, immediately requiring rest.

In desperate circumstances, characters might want to work all day and through the night. Each additional four ancillary activities (four hours) after working overtime or force marching increases the fatigue penalty by 1 point (rounded up).

Most campaign activities are open to any character. Others can only be undertaken if the character meets particular requirements of class, level, location, proficiency, or equipment. The requirements are noted in the activity’s description.

The activities rules are implicitly present in all aspects of play. For instance, delving a dungeon requires an ancillary activity for every 6 turns of exploration. Traveling at expedition speed requires making travel the party’s dedicated activity. Foraging for food is an ancillary activity, so it can be done on the same day dedicated to wilderness travel, but hunting is a dedicated activity so it cannot. A more expansive list of activities is provided in Chapter 8, **Campaigns**.

# Chapter 2: Classes

In the ***Adventurer Conqueror King System****,* there are two major types of classes: human classes and racial or demi-human classes.

Humans are the most widespread of all races. Their ambition, cunning, and courage have led them to settle most of the known world, so most characters in the game will belong to one of the human classes. The core human classes described in these rules are the **fighter**, **explorer**, **thief**, **mage**, **crusader**,and **venturer**. Each of the core classes specializes in a particular aspect of gameplay — combat, wilderness exploration, dungeon delving, arcane casting, divine casting, and mercantile ventures. The core classes are presented in order of complexity, in order to aid you in learning the game. It is much easier for a new player to be a fighter than a venturer, for instance. After the core classes, nine additional human classes, the **assassin**, **barbarian**, **bard**, **bladedancer**, **paladin, priestess**, **shaman, warlock,** and **witch** are provided to show how the core classes can be customized for specific cultures or niches within a campaign setting. Many other human classes can be found in ***ACKS***supplements such as ***Axioms***,***Barbarian Conquerors of Kanahu***, ***Heroic Fantasy Handbook***, and the***Player’s Companion***.

Compared to humans, demi-humans are rare, and generally more specialized. Demi-human classes are defined by their race, with different classes available for dwarves, elves, and other demi-humans. The six demi-human classes described in these rules are the **dwarven craftpriest**, **dwarven vaultguard**, **elven nightblade, elven spellsword**, **Nobiran wonderworker**, and **Zaharan ruinguard**. Additional demi-human classes can be found in ***ACKS***supplements such as ***Aryxymaraki’s Almanac of Unusual Magic***, ***Axioms***, ***Barbarian Conquerors of Kanahu***, ***By This Axe***, ***Heroic Fantasy Handbook***, ***Player’s Companion***, and ***Secrets of the Nethercity****.*

Each class in this book is presented with eight pre-generated **templates**, with weapons, armor, equipment, proficiencies, and spells ready for play. You determine your character’s template randomly with a roll of 3d6. If you don’t like the template you rolled, you can choose a template from a lower roll, but not from a higher roll.

Selecting equipment and proficiencies can be time-consuming, especially for new players. Even experienced players might want a faster alternative, particularly in campaigns that tend to be highly lethal for low level characters. However, if the players and Judge are all familiar with ***ACKS***or have time to invest*,* the Judge can opt to have the players roll 3d6 x 10 for starting gold and then assign them or have them pick proficiencies, spells, and equipment as desired.

For a campaign with a highly specific setting, the Judge might offer a default to a different template that is more appropriate to his campaign. For example, a maritime or “saltbox” campaign might allow fighters to default to the corsair template, thieves to the buccaneer template, and explorers to the mariner template. A campaign filled with Renaissance era intrigue might allow bards to default to the spy template, bladedancers to the veiled assassin template, and mages to the noble magist template. The ultimate decision of whether templates are used during character creation, and if so under what conditions, is always in the Judge’s hands.

## Character Templates and Intellect Scores

In building the character class templates, we assumed that the character had an Intellect score of 12 or less. If your character has an INT score of 13 – 15, you should select one additional general proficiency on top of those listed for the template. If your character has an INT of 16 – 17, you should select two additional general proficiencies. If your character has an INT of 18, you should select three additional general proficiencies. It’s helpful to select proficiencies that complement the template, but you are free to choose any general proficiency you’d like (unless the Judge rules otherwise).

EXAMPLE: Jim has created an assassin with INT 16. The assassin’s template is Infiltrator, so he begins with the Skulking and Disguise proficiencies. Since the assassin has an INT of 16, Jim gets to select an additional two general proficiencies. Reviewing the list of general proficiencies, he decides on Mimicry and Performance (Acting).

### Intellect Scores of Studious Spellcasters

Dwarven craftpriests, elven nightblades, elven spellswords, mages, Nobiran wonderworkers, witches, and Zaharan ruinguards are a type of character known as **studious spellcasters.** Studious spellcasters tend to have higher than average Intellect scores. Therefore, the templates for these classes assume that the character has an INT attribute of between 13 and 15, qualifying him for one bonus proficiency and one bonus spell known in his repertoire. The bonus proficiency that each arcane spellcasting template begins with is noted in bold, while the bonus spell is listed second in the description of the caster’s spellbook.

If a studious spellcaster is created with an INT of 12 or less, then the template actually has more proficiencies and spells than the character is eligible to possess. In this case, you must delete the third listed proficiency and the second listed spell from the template.

EXAMPLE: Jim creates a mage with an INT of 11. The mage’s template is warmage. The listed proficiencies for the warmage are Battle Magic, Military Strategy, and Siege Engineering, while the listed spells are *slicing**blow*and *arcane**armor*. Because Jim’s mage only has INT 11, he loses the Siege Engineering proficiency and the *arcane**armor*spell.

On the other hand, if you create a studious spellcaster has an INT of 16 – 17, you should select one additional general proficiency and one additional spell. If you roll up a studious spellcaster with an INT of 18, you should select two additional general proficiencies and two additional spells. Additional spells should be selected according to the rules for **Starting Spell Repertoires** (p. XX).

## Core Classes

### Fighter

Key Attribute: STR

Requirements: None

Hit Dice: 1d8

Maximum Level: 14

Fighters are experts in the arts of combat and war. In the Auran Empire, fighters might have learned their arts as legionaries or cataphracts in the Imperial Army, gladiators battling for glory in the arena, raiders off the Jutland coast, or sell-swords in the games of the noble houses.

###### Combat Characteristics

As their name suggests, fighters are exceptionally skilled combatants. No other class is as broadly trained in the arts of combat.

**Combat Proficiencies:** Fighters have weapon proficiency with all weapons, armor proficiency with all armor, and fighting style proficiency with all three optional styles (i.e. the dual weapon, two-handed weapon, and weaponand shield styles).

**Combat Progression:** Fighters advance in attack throws and saving throws by two points every three levels of experience. They increase their base damage roll from successful missile and melee attacks by +1 at 1st level, and by an additional +1 at 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th level. They can cleave after killing a foe a maximum of once per round per class level.

| 14 | 4+ | 5+ | 6+ | 7+ | 8+ | 1+ |

###### Starting Class Powers

At the start of play, fighters have the following class power:

**Manual of Arms:** The fighter is highly experienced in military discipline, physical fitness, and weapon drill. He can automatically identify the battle standards, equipment, great captains, military slang, and rank insignia of his homeland. He can identify those of other realms with a proficiency throw of 11+. He can fight as a regular (rather than irregular) in formed and loose units. He can begin play as a member of a legion, mercenary’s guild, or other military organization (Judge’s discretion). (This class power is equivalent to one rank of Manual of Arms proficiency.)

###### Additional Class Powers

When they advance in level, fighters gain the following additional class powers:

**Battlefield Prowess (5th level):** The fighter’s presence inspires troops he leads. Any henchmen and mercenaries hired by the fighter gain a +1 bonus to their morale score whenever he personally leads them. This bonus stacks with any modifiers from the fighter’s Charisma or proficiencies.

**Castle (9th level):** By acquiring a **castle** or fort worth at least 15,000gp, the fighter can attract followers to his service. 5d6 x 10 0th level troops and 1d6 fighters of 1st – 3rd level arrive to serve him within 1d3 months of him acquiring the castle. If the fighter already has a castle, the followers arrive to serve him within 1d3 months of him reaching 9th level. The fighter must pay his followers the ordinary rates for mercenaries and henchmen or they leave his service. In time, the fighter might become a great lord, commanding armies to conquer vast realms. Additional rules for castles are detailed in the **Campaigns** chapter (p. XX).

###### Class Proficiencies

**Proficiency Progression:** At 1st level, fighters select one class proficiency from their class proficiency list and one general proficiency from the general proficiency list. They select an additional class proficiency at 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th level. They select an additional general proficiency at 5th, 9th, and 13th level.

**Fighter Proficiency List:** Acrobatics, Alertness, Berserkergang, Blind Fighting, Combat Ferocity, Combat Reflexes, Combat Trickery (disarm, force back, knock down, overrun, sunder), Command, Dungeonbashing Expertise, Fighting Style Specialization, Intimidation, Leadership, Manual of Arms, Military Strategy, Mounted Combat, Precise Shooting, Riding, Running, Siege Engineering, Skirmishing, Swashbuckling, Unarmed Fighting, Weapon Finesse, Weapon Focus

### Explorer

Key Attribute: CON

Requirements: None

Hit Dice: 1d6

Maximum Level: 14

Explorers are scouts, settlers, and surveyors hardened to the challenges of the wild. Few adventuring parties would dare the wilderness without an experienced explorer to guide them. Within the Auran Empire, an explorer might be an Imperial scout from the Legions, a barbarian hunter from the northern forests of Jutland, or a settler pushing past the borders of the Empire.

| 850,000 | Lord Warden | 14 | 9d6 + 10\* | +5 |
| \*No adjustment from Constitution applies to this flat bonus. | | | | |

###### Combat Characteristics

Because weapons and armor are cumbersome and exhausting on long journeys, explorers tend to stay lightly equipped and prefer to evade foes where possible. That said, many fighters have underestimated explorers to their peril, for they are skilled archers and warriors when they need to be.

**Combat Proficiencies:** Explorers have weapon proficiency with all missile weapons and with all tiny, small, and medium melee weapons. They have armor proficiency with medium, light, and very light armor. They have fighting style proficiency with all three optional styles (i.e. the dual weapon, two-handed weapon, and weapon and shield styles).

**Combat Progression:** Like fighters, explorers advance in attack throws and saving throws by two points every three levels of experience. They increase their base damage roll from successful missile and melee attacks by +1 at 1st level, and by an additional +1 at 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th level. They can cleave after killing a foe a maximum of once per round per class level.

| 13 | 5+ | 6+ | 7+ | 8+ | 9+ | 2+ |
| 14 | 4+ | 5+ | 6+ | 7+ | 8+ | 1+ |

###### Starting Class Powers

At the start of play, explorers have the following class powers. Some of the explorer’s powers require him to be in familiar territory. At 1st level, an explorer is considered familiar with the settled territory of his starting region as well as unsettled territory within one 24-mile hex radius of settled territories. With each additional level of experience, the radius increases one 24-mile hex further from settled territory.

**Alertness:** Explorers are always alert to danger.An explorer gains a +1 bonus to avoid surprise. When using Adventuring proficiency to search or listen, he succeeds on a proficiency throw of 14+ (instead of the usual 18+). If separately proficient in Searching or Listening, he gains a +2 bonus to his throw instead.

**Ambushing:** Explorers are skilled at ambushing unprepared enemies. An explorer can ambush any **vulnerable** opponent. Ambushes can be made in melee or with missile weapons at short range, but cannot be made with missile weapons at medium or longer range. When ambushing, an explorer gets a +4 bonus on his attack throws and deals an extra die of damage on the attack. (This class power is the equivalent of Ambushing proficiency.)

**Animal Reflexes:** Explorers react to danger as fast as a deer to a wolf. An explorer gains a +1 bonus to initiative and a +1 bonus to avoid surprise. (This bonus stacks with the bonus from Alertness, so in most cases explorers have a +2 bonus to avoid surprise.)

**Endurance**: Explorers are inured to the hardship and fatigue of travel. When exploring, an explorer does not need to rest every 6 turns. An explorer can force march for one day without penalty, plus one additional day for each point of Constitution bonus. (This class power is equivalent to Endurance proficiency.)

**Evasion:** Explorers learn to avoid the wild beasts of the wilderness. When the explorer guides the party in familiar territory, the party gains a +5 bonus to proficiency throws to evade wilderness encounters. The explorer’s party can evade wilderness encounters even when **surprised** provided the explorer is not surprised. See **Evasion** (p. xx) for more details on evading encounters.

**Pathfinding:** Explorers rarely lose their bearings, even in trackless wilderness. When the explorer guides a party in familiar territory, the party gains a +4 bonus on proficiency throws to avoid getting lost. See **Wilderness Expeditions** section of Chapter 6 (p. XX) for more details on getting lost.

**Natural Stealth:** As hunters and wilderness scouts, explorers are naturally sneaky. Opponents suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls when encountering an explorer approaching from outside line of sight or lying in wait in cover or darkness.

###### Additional Class Powers

When they advance in level, explorers gain the following additional class powers:

**Experience and Hardiness (5th level):** When an explorer reaches 5th level (Guide), his experience and hardiness reassure those who follow him into the wild. Hirelings on a wilderness adventure led by the explorer gain a +1 bonus to their morale score. This bonus stacks with any modifiers from Charisma or proficiencies.

**Border Fort (9th level):** By acquiring a **border fort** worth at least 15,000gp, the explorer can attract followers to his service. 5d6 x 10 0th level troops and 1d6 explorers of 1st – 3rd level arrive to serve him within 1d3 months of him acquiring the border fort. If the explorer already has a border fort, the followers arrive to serve him within 1d3 months of him reaching 9th level. The explorer must pay his followers the ordinary rates for mercenaries and henchmen or they leave his service. In time, the explorer might become the warden of a flourishing colony. In order for a stronghold to count as a border fort, it must be constructed in outlands or unsettled territory. An explorer within 24 miles of a domain secured by his border fort never becomes lost and gains an additional +4 bonus to evade encounters because of his familiarity with the region. Additional rules for border forts are detailed in the **Campaigns** chapter (p. XX).

###### Class Proficiencies

**Proficiency Progression:** At 1st level, explorers select one class proficiency from their class proficiency list and one general proficiency from the general proficiency list. They select an additional class proficiency at 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th level. They select an additional general proficiency at 5th, 9th, and 13th level.

**Explorer Proficiency List:** Beast Friendship, Climbing, Combat Ferocity, Combat Reflexes, Combat Trickery (disarm, knock down), Driving, Eavesdropping, Elven Bloodline, Fighting Style Specialization, Illusion Resistance, Land Surveying, Mapping, Mountaineering, Mounted Combat, Naturalism, Navigation, Passing Without Trace, Precise Shooting, Prospecting, Riding, Running, Seafaring, Skirmishing, Sniping, Swashbuckling, Trapping, Weapon Finesse, Weapon Focus

**Notes:** The mariner’s and outrider’s scimitar is a type of short sword.

### Thief

Key Attribute: DEX

Requirements: None

Hit Dice: 1d4

Maximum Level: 14

Where other classes rely on their valor in battle or power with magic, thieves rely on cunning, stealth, and subterfuge. Sometimes a thief will belong to an organized criminal syndicate from the character’s local town, where he can seek shelter and information between adventures. However, many adventuring thieves are independent of any guild, and some even refuse to call themselves thieves at all — preferring terms such as expert treasure hunter, gentleman adventurer, or dungeoneer. In the Auran Empire, thieves are everywhere, from the slums of the ports of Kushtu to the highest halls of the Senate in Aura.

| 680,000 | Prince of Thieves | 14 | 9d4 + 10\* | +4d |
| \*No adjustment from Constitution applies to this flat bonus. | | | | |

###### Combat Characteristics

Thieves are trained combatants, although not as skilled as fighters. Because of their need of stealth and free movement, they tend to be lightly equipped and not sufficiently armored to endure a stand-up fight.

**Combat Proficiencies:** Thieves have weapon proficiency with all missile weapons and with all tiny, small, and medium melee weapons. They have armor proficiency with light and very light armor. They have fighting style proficiency with the dual weapon and two-handed weapon styles, but not with the weapon and shield style.

**Combat Progression:** Thieves advance in attack throws and saving throws by two points every four levels of experience. They do not gain any bonus to damage as they advance in level. They can cleave after killing a foe a maximum of once per round per every two class levels (rounded down).

###### Starting Class Powers

Certain of the thief’s class powers, known as his **thief skills**, improve like attack throws and saving throws as the thief gains levels. The progression for each thief skill is shown on the Thief Skills table below. Each thief skill has special rules that apply to it, described in the entry for that class power.

| 14 | -7+ | -2+ | 1+ | -3+ | -4+ | -3+ | -4+ | 1+ |

**Backstabbing:** Thieves are skilled at treacherously attacking unprepared enemies. A thief can backstab any **vulnerable** opponent. Backstabs can be made in melee or with missile weapons at short range, but cannot be made with missile weapons at medium or longer range. When backstabbing, a thief gains a +4 bonus to hit and if the attack succeeds, the thief deals an additional die of damage at 1st level, and another additional die at 5th, 9th, and 13th level.

**Climbing:** Thieves are adept at scaling sheer surfaces, including smooth walls or steep cliffs. The thief must make a Climbing proficiency throw for each 100’ climbed (with a minimum of one check required). If the throw succeeds, the thief can safely ascend or descend the distance. If the throw fails, the thief falls a distance equal to half the attempted distance, plus the distance covered by any previous throws, taking 1d6 bludgeoning damage per 10 feet. A thief can climb at his exploration speed or one-third his combat speed without penalty. If he moves at one-half combat speed, he takes a -5 penalty to the proficiency throw, and if he moves at full combat speed, he takes a -10 penalty. For further rules on climbing, see p. XX.

**Hiding:** Thieves are trained to skulk unseen in the cover of darkness. A thief can begin hiding as a combat action anytime he is in cover, dim light, or darkness. When the thief begins hiding, the Judge must make a Hiding proficiency throw on behalf of the thief. A thief will always think he is successful in this skill, and will not know otherwise until others react to his presence. Regardless of whether the throw succeeds, opponents encountering the thief suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls as long as he remains stationary in cover, dim light, or darkness.

If the throw succeeds, the thief is **hidden**. If the throw fails, the thief is not hidden. No creature can claim line of sight on a thief that is hidden from it. If a hidden thief engages an unengaged opponent, the opponent cannot make a free facing change (p. XX). If an opponent knows the hidden thief’s general location, the opponent can attack him in melee at a -4 penalty, but it cannot even blindly attack the thief if it doesn’t knows his general location. The hidden condition expires at the end of the thief’s initiative if he moves or attacks. It also terminates if the cover, dim light, or darkness no longer conceals the thief from his opponents.

**Listening:** Thieves at doors, passageways, or intersections can listen for sounds coming from the other side of the door or passage. The Judge makes a Listening proficiency throw in secret on behalf of the thief. If the throw succeeds, he hears any noises in earshot. If the throw fails, or if there aren’t any noises in earshot, he doesn’t hear anything. The thief must be quiet and must be the closest creature in the party relative to the location of the sound or suspected sound. Listening only requires one round but can only be undertaken once per turn if the party is moving at all, because it takes time for people to settle down into quiet.

**Lockpicking:** With the aid of thieves’ tools, a thief can pick mechanical locks. A thief can pick locks either hastily or methodically.

* Attempting to hastily pick a lock requires one round and a Lockpicking proficiency throw. If the throw succeeds, the lock is opened. If it fails on a natural roll of 1 – 3, the thief breaks his pick in the lock, jamming it. The lock cannot thereafter be picked. If it fails on any other result, the thief cannot figure out how to quickly open the lock. He can still attempt to open it methodically, but cannot make another attempt to hastily pick the same lock again until he reaches a higher experience level.
* Attempting to methodically pick a lock requires one turn (10 minutes) and a Lockpicking proficiency throw with a +4 bonus. If the throw succeeds, the lock is opened. If it fails on a natural roll of 1, the thief breaks his pick in the lock, jamming it. The lock cannot thereafter be picked. If it fails on any other result, the thief fails to pick the lock, but can make another methodical attempt if desired.

Other bonuses or penalties might apply to the throw, depending on the thief’s tools, the complexity of the lock, and other factors.

**Pickpocketing:** The thief is practiced in the art of picking pockets and cutting purses. To use this skill, the thief must move within 5’ of his target and make a Pickpocketing proficiency throw. If the target is unaware of the thief, the thief gains a +4 bonus to the throw. If the throw succeeds, the target can be robbed of the contents of one pocket, or any one item or tiny or small weapon hung on his person (but not a held item or weapon). If the throw fails, the thief fails to pickpocket the target. If the throw fails, and the roll is a natural roll of 1 or less than half the target value, the intended target notices the thieving attempt. The Judge will then make a reaction roll with a -3 penalty to determine the intended victim’s reaction.

**Searching:** Through careful inspection and probing of his surroundings, a thief can find concealed traps, secret doors, obscured objects, buried treasure, and other hidden features. A thief can attempt to search for hidden features either hastily or methodically.

* Attempting to hastily search requires one round and a Searching proficiency throw. The Judge makes the throw in secret on behalf of the thief. If the throw succeeds, the thief notices any hidden features within 5’ of his location. If it fails, or there is nothing hidden, the thief finds nothing. The thief cannot make another attempt to hastily search the same area again until he reaches a higher experience level, but he can attempt to methodically search the location.
* Attempting to methodically search requires one turn (10 minutes) and a Searching proficiency throw with a +4 bonus. The Judge makes the throw in secret on behalf of the thief. If the throw succeeds, the thief notices any hidden features within 5’ of his location. If the throw fails, or there is nothing hidden, the thief finds nothing. The thief can make repeated attempts to methodically search a location if desired.

When a thief is moving at exploration speed, he can choose to attempt to hastily search as he moves. If so, then anytime the thief moves within 5’ of a hidden feature, the Judge secretly makes a proficiency throw on his behalf. If the throw succeeds, the thief notices it (and if it’s a trap, he notices it before triggering it). If the throw fails, the thief does not notice anything (and, if it’s a trap, he or another character in the party might trigger it as they move). Note that this counts as a failure to hastily search for hidden features.

If the thief is equipped with a long pole or similar implement, he can search a 5’ radius area within 10’ of his location. This can be advantageous because if a trap gets set off, he might be far enough to avoid being harmed. Other rules, bonuses or penalties might apply to the attempt, depending on the thief’s tools, the degree of concealment, and other factors.

**Shadowy Senses:** Since the bright light of torches will reveal their positions, thieves learn to rely on superior night-vision, keen hearing and smell, and echolocation to slowly scout through dark alleys, lightless dungeons, and star-lit rooftops. When moving at combat speed or exploration speed, a thief can “see” as if he were carrying a light source that sheds dim light in a 30’ radius. Shadowy senses can be used to fight, probe for traps, and so on. However, shadowy senses cannot be used to discern colors, faces, markings, or flat images (such as frescoes and murals), or to read books, maps, or scrolls. Shadowy senses does not function if the thief is charging or running, if deafened, or if in an area of bright light, magical darkness, or magical silence. Because it counts as dim light, an opponent can hide from shadowy senses.

**Sneaking:** Thieves learn to prowl with great stealth. A thief can begin sneaking as a movement action. He can sneak at his encounter speed or one-half combat speed without penalty. If he moves greater than one-half combat speed, he takes a -5 penalty to the Sneaking proficiency throw. If he runs, he takes a -10 penalty.

When the thief begins sneaking, the Judge must make a Sneaking proficiency throw on behalf of the thief. A thief will always think he is successful in this skill, and will not know otherwise until others react to his presence. Regardless of whether the throw succeeds, opponents encountering the thief suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls if the thief is outside their line of sight.

If the throw succeeds, the thief is also **sneaking**. If the throw fails, the thief is not sneaking. When sneaking, the thief makes no noise when he moves — none whatsoever. Even alert creatures that make a successful Listening proficiency throw will not hear a sound. When a sneaking thief engages an unengaged opponent from the rear, the opponent cannot make a free facing change.

**Streetwise:** The thief has learned the hard lessons taught by life as a criminal. He might begin play as a member of a thieves’ guild or other criminal syndicate (Judge’s discretion). He can engage in hijinks if he has the necessary proficiencies or thief skills. He can automatically identify gestures, signs, slang, and territory of criminal organizations in his home settlement. He can identify those of other urban settlements with a proficiency throw of 11+. Secret organizations or organizations in far-off cities might be harder to recognize. (This class power is equivalent to one rank of Streetwise proficiency.)

**Trapbreaking:** With the aid of thieves’ tools, a thief can attempt to disable or discharge a trap harmlessly. A thief can crack traps either hastily or methodically.

* Attempting to hastily disarm a trap requires one round and a Trapbreaking proficiency throw. If the throw succeeds, the trap is disarmed or discharged harmlessly (thief’s choice). If it fails on a natural roll of 1 – 3, the thief accidentally triggers the trap. If it fails on any other result, the thief cannot figure out how to quickly disable the trap. He can still attempt to disable it methodically, but cannot make another attempt to hastily remove the same trap again until he reaches a higher experience level.
* Attempting to methodically disarm a trap requires one turn (10 minutes) and a Trapbreaking proficiency throw with a +4 bonus. If the throw succeeds, the trap is disarmed or discharged harmlessly. If it fails on a natural roll of 1, the thief accidentally triggers the trap. If it fails on any other result, the thief is unable to disable the trap. The thief can make repeated attempts to methodically remove the same trap if desired.

Other bonuses or penalties might apply to the proficiency throw, depending on the thief’s tools, the complexity of the trap, and other factors.

###### Additional Class Powers

When they advance in level, thieves gain the following additional class powers:

**Deciphering (4th level):** The thief gains the ability to decipher text(including ciphers, treasure maps, and dead languages, but not magical writings). Deciphering a page of text requires one turn (10 minutes) and a successful proficiency throw of 4+ on 1d20. If the roll does not succeed, the thief cannot try to decipher that particular page of text until he reaches a higher level of experience.

**Hideout (9th level):** By acquiring a **hideout** worth at least 5,000gp, the thief can attract followers to his service. 2d6 1st level thieves will arrive to serve him as followers within 1d4 weeks of him acquiring the hideout. If the thief already has a hideout, the followers arrive to serve him within 1d4 weeks of him reaching 9th level. If hired, the followers must be paid standard rates for ruffians. These followers will serve the character with some loyalty, though at least one will be an infiltrator working for the thief’s local rivals, sent to keep an eye on the character. A cunning and resourceful thief can use these followers to start a criminal syndicate. Additional rules for hideouts and syndicates are detailed in the **Campaigns** chapter (p. XX).

**Scrollreading (10th):** The thief gains the ability to read and cast magic from arcane and divine scrolls. The thief does not have to be able to read the language in which the scroll is written provided he has successfully deciphered it before. Reading a magical scroll requires one round and a successful proficiency throw of 4+ on 1d20. However, a failed throw means the spell does not function as expected, and can create a horrible effect at the Judge’s discretion.

###### Class Proficiencies

**Proficiency Progression:** At 1st level, thieves select one class proficiency from their class proficiency list and one general proficiency from the general proficiency list. They select an additional class proficiency at 4th, 8th, and 12th level. They select an additional general proficiency at 5th, 9th, and 13th level.

**Thief Proficiency List:** Acrobatics, Alertness, Arcane Dabbling, Bribery, Cat Burglary, Combat Reflexes, Combat Trickery (disarm, incapacitate), Contortionism, Fighting Style Specialization, Gambling, Intimidation, Lip Reading, Lockpicking Expertise, Mapping, Poisoning, Precise Shooting, Riding, Running, Seafaring, Skirmishing, Skulking, Sniping, Swashbuckling, Trapfinding, Unarmed Fighting, Weapon Finesse, Weapon Focus

### Mage

Key Attribute: INT

Requirements: None

Hit Dice: 1d4

Maximum Level: 14

Sometimes called wizards, sorcerers, or magicians, mages study arcane secrets and cast spells. While early in their career mages have only limited power, experienced mages are able to cast a great number of powerful spells. In the Auran Empire, a mage might be a wizard steeped in the lore of the Tower of Knowledge, a sinister sorcerer of Kemesh or the Sunset Kingdoms, or a hedge wizard with strange charms and hodge-podge traditions.

###### Combat Characteristics

Because of their devotion to arcane study, mages receive limited combat training. They are quite vulnerable to physical danger, and in an adventuring group they should be protected.

**Combat Proficiencies:** Mages have weapon proficiency with clubs, daggers, darts, and staffs. They have no armor proficiency. They have fighting style proficiency with the two-handed weapon style (allowing them to use a staff with both hands), but not with the dual weapon or weaponand shield styles.

**Combat Progression:** Mages advance in attack throws and saving throws by only two points every six levels of experience (i.e., half as fast as fighters). They do not gain any bonus to damage as they advance in level. They cannot cleave, regardless of their level.

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Mage Attack and Saving Throws** | | | | | |  |
| **Level** | **Paralysis** | **Death** | **Blast** | **Implements** | **Spells** | **Attack Throw** |
| 1 – 3 | 13+ | 13+ | 15+ | 11+ | 12+ | 10+ |

| 13 – 14 | 9+ | 9+ | 11+ | 7+ | 8+ | 6+ |

###### Starting Class Powers

At the start of play, mages have the following class powers.

**Arcane Magic:** Mages can learn and cast powerful arcane spells. The number and levels of spells the mage can cast in a single day are listed on the Mage Spell Progression table. A mage’s spell selection is limited to the spells in his **repertoire**. A mage’s repertoire can include a number of spells up to the number and level of spells listed for his level, increased by his Intellect bonus. For instance, Quintus, a 3rd level mage, is able to cast 2 1st level spells and 1 2nd level spell per day. If he has 16 INT (+2 modifier) he can have up to 4 1st level and 3 2nd level spells in his repertoire (though the number of spells he can cast each day is unaffected). More information on casting spells and individual spell descriptions can be found in the **Spells** chapter.

**Collegiate Wizardry**: The mage has received arcane instruction as an apprentice to a mage, pupil at a magical academy, or member of an arcane organization. He can begin play as a member of a wizard’s guild or similar order (Judge’s discretion). He can automatically identify arcane symbols, spell signatures, trappings, and grimoires of his own order or tradition, and can recognize those of other orders or traditions with a proficiency throw of 11+. Rare or esoteric traditions might be harder to recognize. (This class power is the equivalent of one rank of Collegiate Wizardry proficiency).

###### Additional Class Powers

When they advance in level, mages gain the following additional class powers:

**Minor Magical Research (5th level):** The mage can research spells, scribe magical scrolls, and brew potions. Rules for magic research can be found in the **Campaigns** chapter (p. XX).

**Major Magical Research (9th level):** The mage can create more powerful magic items such as weapons, rings, and staffs.

**Sanctum (9th level):** By acquiring a **sanctum** (often a great tower) worth at least 15,000gp, the mage can attract followers to his service. 1d6 apprentices of 1st – 3rd level plus 2d6 apprentices of 0th level arrive to serve him as followers within 1d3 months of him acquiring the sanctum. If the mage already has a sanctum, the followers arrive to serve him within 1d3 months of him reaching 9th level. The apprentices function as assistants in magical research (see p. XXX). If performing magic research, the apprentices must be provided food and lodging, but need not be paid wages. (If asked to accompany the mage on an adventure, the apprentices must be paid wages as henchmen.) If the mage builds a **dungeon** beneath or near his sanctum, monsters will start to arrive to dwell within, often followed by adventurers seeking to fight them. Additional rules for mages’ **sanctums** are detailed in the **Campaigns** chapter (p. XX).

**Supreme Magical Research (11th level):** The mage can learn and cast ritual arcane spells of great power (7th, 8th, and 9th level), craft magical constructs, and create magical crossbreeds. If chaotic, the mage can create necromantic servants and become undead.

###### Class Proficiencies

**Proficiency Progression:** At 1st level, mages select one class proficiency from their class proficiency list and one general proficiency from the general proficiency list. They select an additional class proficiency at 6th and 12th level. They select an additional general proficiency at 5th, 9th, and 13th level.

**Mage Proficiency List**: Alchemy, Battle Magic, Beast Friendship, Black Lore of Zahar, Bright Lore of Aura, Counterspelling, Diplomacy, Elementalism, Elven Bloodline, Engineering, Expanded Repertoire, Experimenting, Familiar, Healing, Illusion Resistance, Knowledge, Language, Loremastery, Magical Engineering, Mastery of Enchantments & Illusions, Mastery of Conjuration & Summoning, Mystic Aura, Quiet Magic, Prestidigitation, Sensing Power, Soothsaying, Transmogrification, Unflappable Casting

**Notes:** Most characters of this class have above average Intellect, and the templates above reflect that. Each template assumes that the character has an INT attribute of between 13 and 15, qualifying him for one bonus proficiency and one bonus spell. The bonus proficiency and bonus spell that each template begins with are noted last. For characters with INT of less than 13 or greater than 15, see the **Intellect Scores of Studious Spellcasters** section earlier in this Chapter.

The Elementalist can choose to replace the fire spells with one of three alternative spell selections available, one for each element:

Air: *thunderclap*,*weave**smoke*

Earth: *earth’s**excrescence*, *sling**stone*

Water: *desiccate*, *slickness*

### Crusader

Key Attribute: WIL

Requirements: None

Hit Dice: 1d6

Maximum Level: 14

Crusaders are holy warriors, trained to fight to further the ends of their faith. Humans who become crusaders have pledged their lives to serve a particular deity or religion. To this end, they conduct their lives in a way that furthers the desires and will of their gods or goddesses. In the Auran Empire, a crusader might be a priest-militant of Ammonar, bearing the light of the Winged Sun against evil, a warrior-monk sworn to the chthonic powers of the Nether Darkness, or anything in between.

###### Combat Characteristics

Crusaders are skilled combatants, albeit not as good as fighters. Though they lack the killer instincts of a trained warrior, their armored conviction can hold the line as well as any.

**Combat Proficiencies:** As they are holy warriors, the particular weapons and armor that crusaders are trained to fight with are determined by the strictures of their religious order. If your Judge has not specified particular religious orders in his campaign, the default crusader is assumed to be a worshipper of Ammonar, God of Law and Light.

The crusaders of Ammonar have weapon proficiency with bolas, cestus, clubs, flails, hammers, maces, morning stars, nets, rocks, slings, saps, staffs, staff-slings, and whips. They have armor proficiency with all armor. They have fighting style proficiency with the weaponand shield and two-handed weapon styles, but not with the dual weapon style. (See the bladedancercampaign class for an example of a crusader variant with a different feel).

**Combat Progression:** Crusaders advance in attack throws and saving throws by two points every four levels of experience (a progression mid-way between fighters and mages). They do not gain any bonus to damage as they advance in level. They can cleave after killing a foe a maximum of once per round per every two class levels (rounded down).

###### Starting Class Powers

At the start of play, crusaders have the following class powers.

**Divine Magic:** By invoking or praying to their deities, crusaders can manifest their power in the form of divine spells. The number and levels of spells the crusader can cast in a single day are listed on the Crusader Spell Progression table. The crusader’s spell selection is limited to the spells in his order’s **repertoire**. See the **Spells** chapter for a list of all available spells.

**Theology:** The crusader has received religious instruction at a seminary, monastery, or temple. He can begin play as a member of a religious hierarchy (Judge’s discretion). He can acquire congregants through proselytizing. He can automatically identify religious symbols, spell signatures, trappings, and holy days of his own faith, and can recognize those of other faiths with a proficiency throw of 11+. Rare or occult cults might be harder to recognize. (This class power is the equivalent of one rank of Theology proficiency.)

**Rebuke Undead:** Most crusaders have the ability to rebuke the undead, invoking the name and power of their deity to turn away, and even destroy, dark powers. When a crusader attempts to rebuke undead, the result is determined by consulting the Crusader Rebuking Undead table, cross-referencing the type of undead with the crusader’s level.

| \*Lawful crusaders can rebuke demons, while chaotic crusaders can control demons and rebuke angels. | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |

A dash means that the crusader does not yet have the piety and power to rebuke that type of undead. An “R” indicates that the crusader automatically rebukes that type of undead, while a “D” means that the crusader automatically destroys that type of undead. A number indicates the target value for a Rebuking proficiency throw. If this roll is successful, or there is an “R” or a “D” in the chart, the crusader immediately rolls 2d6 to see the effect. The number rolled is the number of total Hit Dice of undead monsters that are rebuked or destroyed. No matter what the dice roll result, at least one undead monster will always be rebuked or destroyed, as appropriate, on a successful rebuking. Undead with lower HD are always rebuked before undead with higher HD.

Rebuked undead flee the area for 10 rounds (1 turn) by the best and fastest means available to them. If they cannot flee, they cower in terror, taking no actions and suffering a -2 penalty to AC. If the crusader attacks rebuked undead in melee combat, the rebuking effect is broken, but he can use spells or missile weapons against them, and other characters can attack them in any fashion, without breaking the rebuking effect. Destroyed undead are immediately turned to ash.

There is no limit to how often a crusader can attempt to rebuke undead each day, but if an attempt to rebuke undead completely fails during an encounter, the crusader cannot attempt to rebuke undead again for the remainder of that encounter.

EXAMPLE: Balbus the Blessed, a 5th level crusader, has encountered three 2HD ghouls and two 4HD wights. On his initiative, he decides to rebuke them. Consulting the Rebuking Undead table, Balbus’s player sees he needs to throw 7+ to rebuke the ghouls and 10+ to rebuke the wights. He rolls a 13, meaning he might have rebuked both. Now Balbus rolls 2d6 to determine how many HD of undead he rebukes. His roll is a 6. Balbus rebukes three ghouls (2HD x 3 = 6HD) but not any wights.

Had Balbus rolled a 10 on 2d6, he’d have rebuked three ghouls and one wight. Had Balbus rolled an 8 on 1d20, he’d have only been able to rebuke the ghouls, no matter how many HD he scored.

Some chaotic sects teach their crusaders to **control undead** rather than rebuke them. The undead are controlled for 1 turn per level of the crusader. If the undead would have been destroyed, the undead are controlled for 1 day per level of the crusader instead. Controlled undead behave as if **bewitched***,* obeying the crusader as if they were friends. However, if the controlled undead are rebuked by a crusader during the duration of the control, the control is dispelled immediately. If the duration of the control ends without incident, the undead will flee as if rebuked.

###### Additional Class Powers

When they advance in level, crusaders gain the following additional class powers:

**Minor Magical Research (5th level):** The crusader can scribe scrolls and brew potions.

**Major Magical Research (9th level):** The crusader can create permanent magic items, such as weapons, rings, and staffs.

**Fortified Church (9th level):** By acquiring a **fortified church** worth at least 15,000gp, the crusader can attract followers to his service. Provided the crusader has kept to his code of behavior, he can build a fortified church at half price due to the assistance of his deity and order. 5d6 x 10 0th level troops and 1d6 crusaders of 1st level of the same religion arrive to serve him within 1d3 months of him acquiring the fortified church. If the crusader has already acquired a fortified church, the followers arrive to serve him within 1d3 months of him reaching 9th level. The followers are fanatically brave and completely loyal (loyalty +4 and morale +4). Despite their loyalty, the followers must be paid a fair wage or they might eventually leave his service. Additional rules for fortified churches are detailed in the **Campaigns** chapter (p. XX).

**Supreme Magical Research (11th level):** The crusader can learn and cast ritual divine spells of great power (7th, 8th, and 9th level), and craft magical constructs such as golems and animated statues. If chaotic, the crusader can create necromantic servants and even become undead himself. Rules for magic research can be found in the **Campaigns** chapter (p. XX).

###### Code of Behavior

In order to use spells and rebuke undead, a crusader must uphold the strictures of his faith. If the Judge has not specified particular religious orders in his campaign, the default crusader is assumed to be from the Temple of the Winged Sun, the order devoted to Ammonar, God of Light and Law. Crusaders of Ammonar must obey the following strictures.

* The crusader must always display the holy symbol of his order, the winged sun, somewhere on his person when in public.
* The crusader must offer prayers to Ammonar at dawn. Offering prayers requires one hour (6 turns).
* The crusader must not use any weapons designed to shed blood, such as swords, axes, and arrows.
* The crusader must obey the just laws of the Auran Empire and the lawful orders of its rightful authorities.
* The crusader must not use his divine magic for unlawful or chaotic purposes.

If a crusader ever violates the strictures of his faith, the god might impose penalties upon the crusader. These penalties are entirely up to the Judge. The usual penalty is **disfavor** (p. XX), but might include penalties to turning throws, a reduction in spells available, or even a loss of all crusader powers entirely. To remove the penalties, the crusader will have to atone for his violation by, e.g., sacrificing treasure, undertaking quests, or even receiving an **atonement** spell from a powerful caster of his order (Judge’s discretion).

Sometimes a crusader might grossly violate his strictures and yet seemingly suffer no punishment at all. However, in this case, what has actually occurred is that the crusader has unknowingly become aligned with a new god that is better suited to his actions. After 1d4 weeks, the crusader will learn (through dreams and omens) the identity of his new deity and their new strictures. It is up to the crusader to decide at that time whether to seek atonement with his prior god, or to accept his new faith (which might require, among other things, an alignment change). Because it is impossible to tell the source of a crusader’s divine power, a religious order must pay close attention to the actual behavior of its crusaders to be certain that they are not apostates, heretics, or false prophets. Some religious orders might have special clergy (inquisitors) to root out such characters.

###### Class Proficiencies

**Proficiency Progression:** At 1st level, crusaders select one class proficiency from their class proficiency list and one general proficiency from the general proficiency list. They select an additional class proficiency at 4th, 8th, and 12th level. They select an additional general proficiency at 5th, 9th, and 13th level.

### Venturer

Key Attribute: CHA

Requirements: None

Hit Dice: 1d6

Maximum Level: 14

Commerce is the great wheel upon which the world turns. From the fleshy fingers of slave traders to jewel-clad guild masters, the coin and commodities of the empire are controlled by merchants. But if the stereotypical merchant is a pot-bellied financier profiting from the work of others, the venturer is his opposite: An adventurous world traveler, he personally leads caravans into unknown lands, seeking out exotic goods and new markets. Every venturer is, by definition, an adventurer, and interested in any expedition that promises riches and reward.

###### Combat Characteristics

Venturers are trained combatants, although not as skilled as fighters. They prefer to stay mobile and rely on ranged attacks while their comrades do the close-quarters combat.

**Combat Proficiencies:** Venturers have weapon proficiency with arbalests, composite bows, crossbows, daggers, long bows, short bows, and short swords. They have armor proficiency with medium, light, and very light armor. They have fighting style proficiency with the weapon and shield style, but not with the two-handed weapon or dual weapon styles.

**Combat Progression**: Venturers advance in attack throws and saving throws by two points every four levels of experience (i.e. the same as thieves). They do not gain any bonus to damage as they advance in level. They can cleave after killing a foe a maximum of once per round per every two class levels (rounded down).

###### Starting Class Powers

The business of venturers is business, and their devotion to trade and profit yields them many special abilities. At the start of play, venturers have the following class powers:

**Bribery:** Not every market obeys the rule of law, so a venturer also becomes exceptionally skilled at the art of bribery. He receives a +1 bonus to reaction rolls if he offers one day’s pay for the target; a +2 bonus for a week’s pay; and a +3 bonus for a month’s pay. His bribery is so subtle that the attempt is politely deniable by both parties. The character is only blatant enough to be charged with the crime of bribery if he rolls an unmodified 2 on 2d6.See Offering Bribes (p. XX).

**Diplomacy:** In order to open new markets and establish trade with unknown tribes, venturers studythe art of protocol and parley. They receive a +1 bonus on all reaction rolls when they attempt to parley with intelligent creatures. (This class power is equivalent to Diplomacy proficiency.)

**Expert Bargaining:** Venturers can get the best deals available for goods, services, and information. Any items the venturer purchases cost 10% less than the listed price and any items he sells go for 10% more than the listed price (as per the Bargaining proficiency). If trading with another venturer, or a character with the Bargaining proficiency,the opposed bargainers should make reaction rolls. Whichever character scores the higher result gets the discount. (Special rules apply when using Bargaining for mercantile ventures, see p. XX.) A venturer can select Bargaining proficiency to improve his skills. Each time the proficiency is selected, the character receives a +2 bonus on his reaction roll when negotiating with other bargainers. (This class power is equivalent to one rank of Bargaining proficiency.)

**Expert Traveling:** While most merchants consider risk a financial term, venturers lead their own caravans or fleets, and do so with considerable skill. Venturers begin play with their choice of either Driving or Seafaring proficiency.

**Mercantile Network:** As they travel, venturers build connections with buyers, fences, and peddlers in each area they visit. Whenever venturersbuy or sell equipment, hire retainers, and/or engage in mercantile ventures in a market they have previously entered, they can treat the market as if it were one market class larger than its actual size (Class I markets remain Class I markets) or they can take a +1 bonus to market impact, whichever is more useful. A venturer’s mercantile network does not change market class for purposes of passive investments (p. XX), however.

Cain, a 5th level venturer, is in Siadanos (a Class IV market). He wishes to purchase a heavy warhorse (700gp). According to the Equipment Availability by Market Class table, there is only a 25% chance for 1 heavy warhorse to be available in a Class IV market. However, Cain has visited Siadanos before, so he can treat it as a Class III market. There is a 100% chance for 1 heavy warhorse available in a Class III market, so Cain is able to purchase the heavy warhorse. His party members shake their heads in amazement that he’s found such a fine steed in an outpost town. “I know people,” he explains.

**Multilingual:** As world travelers, venturers become conversant in a wide variety of tongues of their trading partners, thereby gaining three bonus languages. The venturer can select some or all of these languages immediately from among those in common use in the campaign’s starting region or select them later from among those he encounters in play.

**Pathfinding:** When the venturer guides a party in familiar territory, the party gains a +4 bonus on proficiency throws to avoid getting lost. (At 1st level, a venturer is considered familiar with the civilized areas of his starting region as well as all territory within one 24-mile hex radius of civilized areas. With each additional level of experience, the radius increases one 24-mile hex further from civilization.) See the **Wilderness Expeditions** section of Chapter 6 (p. XX) for more details on getting lost.

**Treachery:** Despite the venturer’s agreeable disposition and generous fiscal offerings, sometimes business might get ugly. It is for this reason that every venturer learns the art of treachery. Anytime a venturer uses his Diplomacy or Bribery to gain a Friendly reaction roll, he can force every creature (allied or enemy) within 30’ to make surprise rolls at a -3 penalty by treacherously attacking. Any creature that fails the roll is **surprised** for the first round of combat. If the venturer has some way of secretly signaling to his party (such as Signaling proficiency) or has planned the treachery to occur in advance, then his party does not have to make the surprise roll. The art of treachery cannot be used if the NPC opposition also has a character with this power handling negotiation, due to professional courtesy and mutual paranoia.

Cain and his party members are parleying with representatives of the Argollëan Brotherhood in the sewers of the Undercity below Cyfaraun. Ownership of the elven artifacts found in the Nethercity is a point of contention but after a few minutes of discussion and a few bribes, Cain achieves Friendly reactions with the Brotherhood. With a deal seemingly at hand, Cain uses the art of treachery. He and his party gain a +3 bonus to surprise the Brotherhood thieves by immediately initiating combat.

However, if Liber Faunus were present, this bonus would not apply, because the leader of the Brotherhood is a venturer and hence also comprehends the art of treachery.

###### Additional Class Powers

**Steady Trade Route (2nd level):** Through long-term business dealings, the venturer establishes a steady trade route for transactions in any two types of merchandise between any two of the markets that he has visited. The trade route’s markets, and the specific type of merchandise that is bought and sold at each market, is chosen by the venturer when he establishes the trade route.

Thereafter, anytime the venturer personally enters one of the trade route’s markets, he can add one-half his class level (rounded up) to his market impact when determining the amount of merchandise of that type available for purchase or sale. If that results in his market impact exceeding the market maximum, reduce the market impact by 4 but shift to the next highest market class.

A venturer can also manage an additional passive investment per steady trade route he establishes (p. XX).

**Rumormongering (4th level):** The venturer has learned that business empires rise and fall on information. Through his rumormongering, he can automatically learn 1d4 interesting rumors from old contacts and commercial associates any time he re-visits an urban settlement he has previously done business in. Rumormongering requires one day of dedicated activity in an urban settlement. A venturer can rumormonger in any given urban settlement only once per month.

**Steady Trade Route (6th level):** The venturer establishes a second steady trade route for transactions in any two types of merchandise between any two of the markets that he has visited. The trade route can be for the same merchandise in a new market or markets, for different merchandise in the same market as his current route, or for different merchandise in different markets, as desired. As noted above, the venturer can also manage one additional passive investment when he establishes this trade route.

| IV | 5,000gp |
| V | 2,000gp |
| VI | 1,000gp |
| \*Per 20,000 families | |

**Access to Capital (8th level):** The venturer’s reputation for money-making aids him in securing financing. He can borrow money from the merchant guild at an interest rate of 3% per month without collateral or at an interest rate of 1% per month with collateral. There is no limit to how much he can borrow in total, but each market only has a limited pool of capital for use each month, shown on the adjoining table. If the venturer fails to pay interest each month, he becomes disreputable in that market. While disreputable, he cannot use his mercantile network or friendly merchant connections. If the venturer allows interest payments to build up such that he owes more in gp than his total XP, then his former business partners will begin to send rival adventurers after him, with wages by level that total the monthly interest payment. A henchman will notuse this ability on behalf of his employer, but a player character can do so on behalf of his fellow party members.

Cain has advanced to 8th level, and gains access to capital. While visiting Aura (a huge Class I market with 100,000 families), he borrows 500,000gp without collateral, which he uses to help his fellow adventurers begin building strongholds. However, each month he owes 3% on the outstanding balance in interest, i.e. 15,000gp. If he fails to meet his interest payments, he will become disreputable in Aura, losing use of many of his class powers. In addition, because he owes more than his XP total, if he fails to pay then the merchant guild will send bounty hunters after him. With a debt payment of 15,000gp, he might face a 12th and 8th level bounty hunter team (12,000gp and 3,000gp wage respectively), a party of 5 8th-level bounty hunters (3,000gp wage each), etc.

**Guildhouse (9th level):** By acquiring a **guildhouse** worth at least 5,000gp, the venturer can attract followers to his service. 2d6 1st level venturers will arrive to serve him as followers within 1d4 weeks of him acquiring the guildhouse. If the venturer already has a guildhouse, the followers arrive to serve him within 1d4 weeks of him reaching 9th level. If hired, the followers must be paid standard rates for henchmen. These followers will serve the character with some loyalty, though at least one will be an infiltrator working for the venturer’s local rivals, sent to keep an eye on the character.

Some venturers use their guildhouse to start a criminal syndicate, expanding their wealth through illegitimate channels. When a venturer operates a criminal syndicate, his guildhouse counts as a hideout of one-half its value. The venturer otherwise follows all of the rules for hideouts and hijinks detailed in the **Campaigns** chapter (p. XX).

All venturers, of course, use their guildhouse to coordinate their legitimate investments. The venturer can make a number of additional passive investment of any type equal to the value of his guildhouse divided by the maximum investment in the market class where his guildhouse is located. Rules for passive investments can be found in the **Campaigns** chapter (p. XX).

**Steady Trade Route (10th level):** The venturer establishes a third steady trade route for transactions in any two types of merchandise between any two of the markets that he has visited. The trade route can be for the same merchandise in a new market or markets, for different merchandise in the same market as his current route, or for different merchandise in different markets, as desired. As noted above, the venturer can also manage one additional passive investment when he establishes this trade route.

**Monopoly Power (12th level):** If the venturer has established a guildhouse in a settlement, he canuse it to seize **monopoly power** in that settlement. Thereafter, he earns 1gp per month in monopoly revenue per urban family in the urban settlement. He does not need to be the domain’s ruler to earn this revenue; if he is the domain’s ruler, the monopoly revenue is in addition to his domain revenue. Only one venturer in each urban settlement can earn monopoly revenue from each urban family. If there is more than one venturer with this class power operating in the settlement, then either the character must eliminate his rival(s) or he must come to a deal to distribute the monopoly revenue between the various venturers.

Cain has now become a 12th level merchant prince with a merchant guildhouse in Aura. Aura has 100,000 families, so Cain could earn as much as 100,000gp per month in monopoly revenue if he were the sole venturer in the city. However, the ancient and opulent capital has three other high-level venturers living there, including Armento Drakomir, Tullius Valens, and Varian Lazar. Cain partners with Armento Drakomir to eliminate Tullius Valens and Varian Lazar and the two then split the families between them, each earning 50,000gp in monopoly revenue per month.

## Campaign Classes

### Assassin

Key Attribute: STR and DEX

Requirements: None

Hit Dice: 1d6

Maximum Level: 14

Assassins are humans who train to kill by ambush and treachery. Assassins might be back-alley brawlers, violent thugs, or members of an organized guild. Within the Auran Empire, some assassins are members of the Order of the Eclipse, a religious brotherhood of trained killers, but others are simply murders-for-hire or rogues with a taste for violence.

###### Combat Characteristics

Though lacking somewhat in toughness, assassins are expert combatants with broad training in arms and armor. Although assassins generally prefer fast, concealable, or quiet weapons, killing can occur under many circumstances. And though they favor stealth over steel for protection, sometimes their work requires them to infiltrate or impersonate bodies of troops.

**Combat Proficiencies:** Assassins have weapon proficiency with all weapons. They have armor proficiency with medium, light, and very light armor. They have fighting style proficiency with all three optional styles (i.e. the dual weapon, two-handed weapon, and weaponand shield styles).

**Combat Progression:** Assassins advance in attack throws and saving throws as fighters, by two points every threelevels of experience. Assassins increase their base damage roll from successful missile and melee attacks by +1 at 1st level and by an additional +1 at 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th level. They can cleave after killing a foe a maximum of once per round per class level.

| 14 | 4+ | 5+ | 6+ | 7+ | 8+ | 1+ |

###### Starting Class Powers

At the start of play, assassins have the class powers below. As with thieves, most of the assassin’s skills improve as the assassin gains levels according to the progression on the Assassin Level Progression table. While assassins can wear medium armor, they cannot use their backstabbing, hiding, or sneaking powers unless wearing light armor or less.

**Backstabbing**: Assassins are skilled at treacherously attacking unprepared enemies. An assassin can backstab any **vulnerable** opponent. Backstabs can be made in melee or with missile weapons at short range, but cannot be made with missile weapons at medium or longer range. When backstabbing, an assassin gains a +4 bonus to hit and if the attack succeeds, the assassin deals an additional die of damage at 1st level, and another additional die at 5th, 9th, and 13th level.

**Hiding:** Assassins are trained to skulk unseen in the cover of darkness. An assassin can begin hiding as a combat action anytime he is in cover, dim light, or darkness. When the assassin begins hiding, the Judge must make a Hiding proficiency throw on behalf of the assassin. An assassin will always think he is successful in this skill, and will not know otherwise until others react to his presence. Regardless of whether the throw succeeds, opponents encountering the assassin suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls as long as he remains stationary in cover, dim light, or darkness.

If the throw succeeds, the assassin is **hidden**. If the throw fails, the assassin is not hidden. No creature can claim line of sight on an assassin that is hidden from it. If a hidden assassin engages an unengaged opponent, the opponent cannot make a free facing change (p. XX). If an opponent knows the hidden assassin’s general location, the opponent can attack him in melee at a -4 penalty, but it cannot even blindly attack the assassin if it doesn’t knows his general location. The hidden condition expires at the end of the assassin’s initiative if he moves or attacks. It also terminates if the cover, dim light, or darkness no longer conceals the assassin from his opponents.

**Shadowy Senses:** Since the bright light of torches will reveal their positions, assassins learn to rely on superior night-vision, keen hearing and smell, and echolocation to slowly scout through dark alleys, lightless dungeons, and star-lit rooftops. When moving at combat speed or exploration speed, an assassin can “see” as if he were carrying a light source that sheds dim light in a 30’ radius. Shadowy senses can be used to fight, probe for traps, and so on. However, shadowy senses cannot be used to discern colors, faces, markings, or flat images (such as frescoes and murals) or to read books, maps, or scrolls. Shadowy senses does not function if the assassin is charging or running, if deafened, or if in an area of magical darkness or magical silence. Because it counts as dim light, an opponent can hide from shadowy senses.

**Sneaking:** Assassins learn to prowl with great stealth. An assassin can begin sneaking as a movement action. He can sneak at his encounter speed or one-half combat speed without penalty. If he moves greater than half his combat speed, he takes a -5 penalty to the Sneaking proficiency throw. If he runs, he takes a -10 penalty.

When the assassin begins sneaking, the Judge must make a Sneaking proficiency throw on behalf of the assassin. An assassin will always think he is successful in this skill, and will not know otherwise until others react to his presence. Regardless of whether the throw succeeds, opponents encountering the assassin suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls if the assassin is outside their line of sight.

If the throw succeeds, the assassin is also **sneaking**. If the throw fails, the assassin is not sneaking. When sneaking, the assassin makes no noise when he moves — none whatsoever. Even alert creatures that make a successful Listening proficiency throw will not hear a sound. When a sneaking assassin engages an unengaged opponent from the rear, the opponent cannot make a free facing change.

**Streetwise:** The assassin has learned the hard lessons taught by life as a criminal. He might begin play as a member of an assassin’s guild or other criminal syndicate (Judge’s discretion). He can engage in hijinks if he has the necessary proficiencies or thief skills. He can automatically identify gestures, signs, slang, and territory of criminal organizations in his home settlement. He can identify those of other urban settlements with a proficiency throw of 11+. Secret organizations or organizations in far-off cities might be harder to recognize. (This class power is equivalent to one rank of Streetwise proficiency.)

###### Additional Class Powers

When they advance in level, assassins gain the following additional class powers:

**Hideout (9th level):** By acquiring a **hideout** worth at least 5,000gp, the assassin can attract followers to his service. 2d6 1st level assassins will arrive to serve him as followers within 1d4 weeks of him acquiring the hideout. If the assassin already has a hideout, the followers arrive to serve him within 1d4 weeks of him reaching 9th level. If hired, the followers must be paid standard rates for henchmen. These followers will serve the character with some loyalty, though at least one will be an infiltrator working for the assassin’s local rivals, sent to keep an eye on the character. A cunning and resourceful assassin can use these followers to start a criminal syndicate. Additional rules for hideouts and syndicates are detailed in the **Campaigns** chapter.

###### Class Proficiencies

**Proficiency Progression:** At 1st level, assassins select one class proficiency from their class proficiency list and one general proficiency from the general proficiency list. They select an additional class proficiency at 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th level. They select an additional general proficiency at 5th, 9th, and 13th level.

**Assassin Proficiency List:** Acrobatics, Alchemy, Alertness, Arcane Dabbling, Armor Training, Bribery, Cat Burglary, Climbing, Combat Reflexes, Combat Trickery (disarm, incapacitate), Contortionism, Disguise, Eavesdropping, Fighting Style Specialization, Gambling, Intimidation, Kin-Slaying, Mimicry, Poisoning, Precise Shooting, Running, Skirmishing, Skulking, Sniping, Swashbuckling, Weapon Finesse, Weapon Focus

### Barbarian

Key Attribute: STR and CON

Requirements: None

Hit Dice: 1d8

Maximum Level: 14

Barbarians are tough, hardy warriors from cultures outside of the civilized world. Some barbarians live on the edge of true savagery, while others hail from rich cultures with epic poetry and weapons of steel, but all share an outlander’s mix of contempt and awe for the grand tapestry of civilization. In the Auran Empire, barbarians might be reavers from the bleak wastes of northern Jutland, fierce horse archers from Skysostan, or tribesmen from the Ivory Kingdom jungles of Keita, Munde, and Kushtu.

| \*No adjustment from Constitution applies to this flat bonus. | | | | |

###### Combat Characteristics

Barbarians are fierce and deadly combatants feared throughout the civilized world. Though they lack the broad professional training of the fighter, they more than compensate with their animal reflexes and savage fury.

**Combat Proficiencies:** Barbarians are limited to a range of weapon, armor, and fighting style proficiencies that are traditional to their people, as shown on the Barbarian Combat Proficiencies table below.

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Region** | **Armor Proficiencies** | **Weapon Proficiencies** | **Fighting Style Proficiencies** |
| Jutland | Medium  Light  Very Light | Battle axe, dagger, great axe, hand axe, javelin, short bow, spear, sword, two-handed sword, warhammer | Weapon and shield  Two-handed weapon |
| Skysostan | Medium  Light  Very Light | Composite bow, dagger, hand axe, javelin, lance, short bow, short sword (scimitar), sling, spear, whip | Dual weapon  Weapon and shield |
| Ivory Kingdoms | Medium  Light  Very Light | Bola, club, dart, dagger, hand axe, javelin, net, short bow, short sword, spear | Dual weapon  Weapon and shield |

**Combat Progression:** Barbarians advance in attack throws and saving throws by two points every three levels of experience (i.e. the same progression as fighters). They increase their base damage roll from their choice of either missile or melee attacks by +1 at 1st level and by an additional +1 at 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th level. The barbarian must choose which type of attack will receive the damage bonus at 1st level, and cannot change the choice as he advances (i.e. they can choose to be either melee or missile specialists). They can cleave after killing a foe a maximum of once per round per class level.

| 14 | 4+ | 5+ | 6+ | 7+ | 8+ | 1+ |

###### Starting Class Powers

At the start of play, barbarians have the following class powers.

**Animal Reflexes:** Barbarians react to danger as fast as a deer to a wolf. A barbarian gains a +1 bonus to initiative and a +1 bonus to avoid surprise.

**Natural Proficiency:** Depending on his region of origin, every barbarian possesses natural proficiencies in a particular area. These are bonus proficiencies that do not count against the barbarian’s normal selections.

* Barbarians from Jutland gain Climbing and Seafaring proficiencies.
* Barbarians from Skysostan gain Precise Shooting and Riding proficiencies.
* Barbarians from the Ivory Kingdoms gain Running and Endurance proficiencies.

The Judge might devise other natural proficiencies for other barbarian regions in his own setting.

**Natural Stealth:** As hunters and raiders by trade, barbarians are naturally sneaky. Opponents suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls when encountering a barbarian approaching from outside line of sight or lying in wait in cover or darkness.

**Savage Resilience:** The healers and priests of civilized lands are foreign to barbarians, who rely on their **savage resilience** to survive. When a barbarian is required to consult the Mortal Woundstable, the player can roll twice and choose the preferred result to apply. Barbarians also subtract their class level from the number of days of bed rest required to recover.

EXAMPLE: Sigwulf, a 4th level Barbarian with 16 CON and 24 hp, is reduced to -7 hp. When a friend treats his wounds, Sigwulf rolls on the Mortal Wounds table. He rolls 1d20 and 1d6 twice, and scores a modified 17/2 and an 11/6. An 11/6 results in the loss of 1d6 teeth, while 17/2 results in loss of genitals; the players opts for the 11/6 result and consigns 1d6 of Sigwulf’s teeth to oblivion. Although normally 1 week’s bed rest is required to recover from a result of 11 (critically wounded), this is reduced to just 3 days because of Sigwulf’s class level.

###### Additional Class Powers

When they advance in level, barbarians gain the following additional class powers:

**Animal Magnetism (5th level)**: The barbarian has become a formidable presence who inspires those who follow him. Any henchmen and mercenaries hired by the barbarian gain a +1 bonus to their morale score whenever he personally leads them. This bonus stacks with any modifiers from the barbarian’s Charisma or proficiencies.

**Chieftain’s Hall (9th level):** By acquiring a **chieftain’s hall** worth at least 15,000gp, the barbarian can attract followers to his service. 5d6 x 10 0th level troops and 1d6 barbarians of 1st – 3rd level arrive to serve him within 1d3 months of him acquiring the chieftain’s hall. If the barbarian already has a chieftain’s hall, the followers arrive to serve him within 1d3 months of him reaching 9th level. The barbarian must pay his followers the ordinary rates for mercenaries and henchmen or they leave his service. Additional rules for chieftain’s halls are detailed in the **Campaigns** chapter.

###### Class Proficiencies

### Bard

Key Attribute: DEX and CHA

Requirements: None

Hit Dice: 1d4

Maximum Level: 14

Successful adventurers live forever in the sagas and songs about their deeds. Remembering and recounting these sagas is the profession of bards. Most bards are content to recite the deeds of others, but some bold few participate in the dangers themselves and become inspiring heroes in their own right. In the Auran Empire, such a bard might be an adventuring minstrel with a sword in his hand and a song at his lips, a warrior-skald of the Jutland kingdoms, or a haughty Kemeshi aristocrat.

###### Combat Characteristics

**Combat Proficiencies:** Bards have weapon proficiency with all missile weapons and with all tiny, small, and medium melee weapons. They have armor proficiency with medium, light, and very light armor. They have fighting style proficiency with all three optional styles (i.e. the dual weapon, two-handed weapon, and weaponand shield styles).

**Combat Progression:** Bards advance in attack throws and saving throws by two points every three levels of experience. They increase their base damage roll from successful missile and melee attacks by +1 at 1st level, and by an additional +1 at 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th level. They can cleave after killing a foe a maximum of once per round per class level.

###### Starting Class Powers

At the start of play, bards have the following class powers. As with thieves, some of the bard’s throws improve as he gains levels according to the progression shown on the Bard Level Progression table.

**Arcane Dabbling:** Bards are prone to dabble in the arcane. They can attempt to use wands, staffs, and other magic items only usable by arcane casters. The bard does not need to know the command word for the item, but he must make a proficiency throw of 4+ on 1d20 or the attempt backfires in some desultory way (Judge’s discretion).

**Inspire Courage:** By reciting heroic lays and epic poems, bards can improve the effectiveness of their allies. Inspiring courage requires a few moments of oration before a battle (one round), and makes up to 30 of the bard’s allies within a 50’ radius **inspired**. An inspired creature gains a +1 bonus to attack throws, armor class, morale rolls (for monsters or NPCs allied with the caster), and saving throws against magical **fear**. The bonus lasts for 10 minutes (1 turn). A bard can inspire courage once per day per class level. (Even the most inspired epic gets stale if you hear it twice in the same day.) A bard cannot inspire courage on characters who are already **engaged** in combat.

**Jack of All Trades:** Being habitually curious jacks-of-all-trades, bards pick up an array of skills that vary widely. The bard can learn a class proficiency from any class; a thief skill (excluding backstab); a venturer class power (excluding mercantile network); or other class power approved by the Judge, excluding spellcasting powers. The bard cannot select a class power when the bard’s class level is lower than the class level at which that power becomes available to its default class. For instance, he could not select Rumormongering at 1st level because it doesn’t become available to venturers until 4th level. Note that some selections might not be useful; e.g. the bard has no spells to regain with Contemplation, so that proficiency isn’t ever a good choice.

**Listening:** Bards have sharp ears that permit them to hear noises in caves, hallways, at a door, or other locations. The Judge makes a Listening proficiency throw in secret on behalf of the bard. If the throw succeeds, he hears any noises in earshot. If the throw fails, or if there aren’t any noises in earshot, he doesn’t hear anything. The bard must be quiet and must be the closest creature in the party relative to the location of the sound or suspected sound. Listening only requires one round but can only be undertaken once per turn (10 minutes) if the party is moving at all, because it takes time for people to settle down into quiet.

**Loremastery:** The bard can make a proficiency throw of 18+ to decipher occult runes, remember ancient history, or identify a historic artifact or special monster part. The proficiency throw required reduces by 1 per level. He can also identify magic items as if he were a 5th level mage. (This class power is the equivalent of Loremastery proficiency.)

**Multilingual:** Because they travel widely and converse freely, bards become conversant in a wide variety of tongues. They gain three bonus languages. The bard can select some or all of these languages immediately from among those in common use in the campaign’s starting region or select them later from among those he encounters in play. (This class power is the equivalent of one rank of Language proficiency.)

**Performance:** The bard has been trained in a performing art such as chanting, reciting poetry, singing, or playing an instrument. He can earn 10gp per month from working as a street performer or tavern entertainer. He can identify renowned performers, famous works, and unusual songs with a proficiency throw of 11+. (This class power is equivalent to one rank of Performance proficiency.)

###### Additional Class Powers

**Jack of All Trades II (3rd level):** The bard can learn another class proficiency from any class, thief skill (excluding backstab), venturer class power (excluding mercantile network), or other class power approved by the Judge, excluding spellcasting.

**Deciphering (4th level****):** The bard gains the ability to decipher text(including ciphers, treasure maps, and dead languages, but not magical writings). Deciphering a page of text requires one turn (10 minutes) and a successful proficiency throw of 4+ on 1d20. If the roll does not succeed, the bard cannot try to decipher that particular page of text until he reaches a higher level of experience.

**Chronicles of Battle (5th):** The bard’s songs and stories inspire his hirelings to strive for glory. Any henchmen and mercenaries hired by the bard gain a +1 bonus to their morale score while the bard is present to witness and record their deeds. This bonus stacks with any modifiers from the bard’s Charisma or proficiencies.

**Jack of All Trades III (6th level):** The bard can learn another class proficiency from any class, thief skill (excluding backstab), venturer class power (excluding mercantile network), or other class power approved by the Judge, excluding spellcasting.

| Max HP | Temp HP Gained |
| 1 – 3 | 1d2 |

| 77 – 89 | 2d12 |
| 90 – 110 | 3d10 |
| 111 – 140 | 4d10 |
| 141 – 170 | 5d10 |
| 171+ | 6d10, plus 1d10  per 30 hp past 170 |

**Inspire Hope (7th):** By recounting the glorious deeds of old, bards can brighten the darkest moment. Inspiring hope requires a few moments of oration (one round), and grants up to 30 of the bard’s allies within 30’ a pool of temporary hit points. The number of hit points gained by each ally is determined on the adjoining table based on the bard’s or the ally’s max hit points (whichever is lower). These temporary hit points last for one turn (10 minutes), until lost to damage, or until the bard inspires hope on the ally again, whichever comes first. The bard can inspire hope once per day at 7th level, and one additional time per day with each level thereafter.

**Jack of All Trades IV (8th level):** The bard can learn another class proficiency from any class, thief skill (excluding backstab), venturer class power (excluding mercantile network), or other class power approved by the Judge, excluding spellcasting.

**Great Hall (9th level):** By acquiring a **great hall** worth at least 15,000gp, the bard can attract followers to his service. 5d6 x 10 0th level troops and 1d6 bards of 1st – 3rd level arrive to serve him within 1d3 months of him acquiring the hall. If the bard already has a hall, the followers arrive to serve him within 1d3 months of him reaching 9th level. The bard must pay his followers the ordinary rates for mercenaries and henchmen or they leave his service. Additional rules for great halls are detailed in the **Campaigns** chapter.

**Scrollreading (10th):** The bard gains the ability to read and cast magic from arcane and divine scrolls. The bard does not have to be able to read the language in which the scroll is written provided he has successfully deciphered it before. Reading a magical scroll requires one round and a successful proficiency throw of 4+ on 1d20. However, a failed throw means the spell does not function as expected, and can create a horrible effect at the Judge’s discretion.

**Jack of All Trades V (11th level):** The bard can learn another class proficiency from any class, thief skill (excluding backstab), venturer class power (excluding mercantile network), or other class power approved by the Judge, excluding spellcasting.

###### Class Proficiencies

**Proficiency Progression:** At 1st level, bards select one class proficiency from their class proficiency list and one general proficiency from the general proficiency list. They select an additional class proficiency at 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th level. They select an additional general proficiency at 5th, 9th, and 13th level.

**Bard Proficiency List:** Acrobatics, Bargaining, Beast Friendship, Bribery, Combat Trickery (disarm), Command, Diplomacy, Disguise, Elven Bloodline, Fighting Style Specialization, Healing, Knowledge, Language, Leadership, Lip Reading, Magical Engineering, Magical Music, Mimicry, Mystic Aura, Performance, Precise Shooting, Prestidigitation, Running, Seduction, Skirmishing, Swashbuckling, Weapon Finesse, Weapon Focus

### Bladedancer

Key Attribute: WIL and DEX

Requirements: None

Hit Dice: 1d6

Maximum Level: 14

Bladedancers are human women who have dedicated themselves to the service of a goddess of war. They belong to military clerical orders, where they are trained in fighting and casting spells. Within the Auran Empire, most bladedancers are trained to the art from a young age in the Temples of Ianna, Goddess of Love and War. A fully trained bladedancer is highly coveted as a bodyguard and escort by the great noble houses.

###### Combat Characteristics

Bladedancers are skilled combatants trained in the graceful fighting style that gives them their name.

**Armor and Weapons:** Bladedancers have weapon proficiency with all swords (including daggers, short swords, swords, and two-handed swords) and all spears (including lances, javelins, polearms, and spears). They have armor proficiency with light and very light armor. They have fighting style proficiency with the dual weapon and two-handed weapon styles, but not with the weapon and shield style.

**Combat Progression:** At first level, bladedancers hit an unarmored foe (AC 0) with an attack throw of 10+. They advance like crusaders in attack throws and saving throws, by two points every four levels of experience. They do not gain any bonus to damage as they advance in level. They can cleave after killing a foe a maximum of once per round per every two class levels (rounded down).

| 13 – 14+ | 7+ | 4+ | 10+ | 7+ | 9+ | 4+ |

###### Starting Class Powers

At the start of play, bladedancers have the following class powers.

**Graceful Fighting:** The bladedancer fights in an agile and acrobatic style that resembles a choreographed dance. If a bladedancer is wearing light armor, very light armor, or no armor, and carrying 5 stones or less encumbrance, she gains a +1 bonus to initiative and a +1 bonus to Armor Class. At 7th level, the AC bonus increases to +2, and at 13th level the AC bonus increases to +3.

Graceful fighting can be stacked with Swashbuckling proficiency to increase the AC bonus, but the bonus from Swashbuckling is capped at +1 unless the bladedancer is unarmored.

**Divine Magic:** Bladedancers can manifest their goddess’s power in the form of divine spells, which are granted through prayer and worship. The number and levels of spells the bladedancer can cast in a single day are listed on the Bladedancer Spell Progression table. The bladedancer’s spell selection is limited to the spells in her order’s **repertoire** (which is different than that of the crusader). See the **Spells** chapter for a list of all available spells.

**Strength of Faith:** When the bladedancer strikes a foe, the goddess lends her strength to the blow. The bladedancer can apply her WIL modifier instead of her STR modifier on any damage roll affected by STR.

**Theology:** Every bladedancer receives religious instruction at an abbey, cloister, or temple. She can begin play as a member of a religious hierarchy (Judge’s discretion). She can acquire congregants through proselytizing. She can automatically identify religious symbols, spell signatures, trappings, and holy days of her own faith, and can recognize those of other faiths with a proficiency throw of 11+. Rare or occult cults might be harder to recognize. (This class power is the equivalent of one rank of Theology proficiency.)

**Weapon Finesse:** Bladedancers fight with lissome speed and cat-like agility. A bladedancer can apply her DEX modifier instead of her STR modifier on her melee attack throws when using weapons with which she is proficient. (This class power is the equivalent of Weapon Finesse proficiency, except that it applies to the bladedancer’s specific weapons rather than to all tiny, small, or medium weapons. It cannot stack with Weapon Finesse.)

###### Additional Class Powers

When they advance in level, bladedancers gain the following additional class powers:

**Minor Magical Research (5th):** The bladedancer can scribe scrolls and brew potions.

**Major Magical Research (9th):** The bladedancer can create permanent magic items such as enchanted armor, rings, or weapons.

**Temple (9th level):** By acquiring a **temple** worth at least 15,000gp, the bladedancer can attract followers to her service. So long as the bladedancer is currently in favor with her goddess, she can buy or build her temple at half the normal price due to miraculous assistance. 5d6 x 10 0th level troops and 1d6 bladedancers of 1st level of the same religion arrive to serve her within 1d3 months of her acquiring the temple. If the bladedancer has already acquired a temple, the followers arrive to serve her within 1d3 months of her reaching 9th level. The followers are fanatically brave and completely loyal (loyalty +4 and morale +4). Despite their loyalty, the followers must be paid a fair wage or they might eventually leave the bladedancer’s service. Additional rules for temples are detailed in the **Campaigns** chapter.

**Supreme Magical Research (11th level):** The bladedancer can learn and cast ritual divine spells of great power (7th, 8th, and 9th level) and craft magical constructs. If chaotic, the bladedancer can create necromantic servants and become undead. Rules for magic research can be found in the **Campaigns** chapter (p. XX).

###### Code of Behavior

Like crusaders, bladedancers must uphold the strictures of their order and their goddess. If the Judge has not specified particular religious orders in his campaign, the default bladedancer is assumed to be from the Temple of the Blade and Veil, the order devoted to Ianna, Goddess of Love and War. The strictures of their order are many.

* The bladedancer must always carry a weapon on her person, except where imperial or sacred law forbids it.
* The bladedancer must offer prayers to Ianna at either dawn or dusk. Offering prayers requires one hour (6 turns).
* The bladedancer must not debase herself by fighting with the implements of the peasantry such as axes and hammers, by dishonorably firing bows or slings from a distance, or by resorting to shields for defense. (She can, however, hurl javelins or spears she carries.)
* The bladedancer must not get married or have children before she reaches the rank of Blade-Dancer (7th level). She needn’t remain chaste, however, and may have liaisons as desired.
* The bladedancer must not use her divine magic for unlawful or chaotic purposes.

If a bladedancer ever falls from favor, due to violating the strictures of her faith, the goddess can impose penalties upon the bladedancer. As with crusaders, these penalties are entirely up to the Judge.

###### Class Proficiencies

**Proficiency Progression:** At 1st level, bladedancers select one class proficiency from their class proficiency list and one general proficiency from the general proficiency list. They select an additional class proficiency at 4th, 8th, and 12th level. They select an additional general proficiency at 5th, 9th, and 13th level.

**Bladedancer Proficiency List**: Acrobatics, Battle Magic, Beast Friendship, Combat Reflexes, Combat Trickery (disarm, knock down), Contemplation, Diplomacy, Divine Blessing, Divine Health, Elven Bloodline, Fighting Style Specialization, Laying on Hands, Magical Music, Martial Training, Mounted Combat, Mystic Aura, Prestidigitation, Prophecy, Quiet Magic, Running, Seduction, Skirmishing, Swashbuckling, Syncretism, Unarmed Fighting, Unflappable Casting, Weapon Focus

### Paladin

Key Attribute: STR and CHA

Requirements: None

Hit Dice: 1d8

Maximum Level: 14

Paladins are champions of Law who fight unceasingly against those who seek to extinguish the light of civilization. Wherever the forces of Chaos marshal to threaten man, paladins can be found, battling back the darkness with courage and steel. In the Auran Empire, paladins are, like crusaders, members of holy militant orders. Unlike the crusaders’ orders, which are dedicated to the service of particular Empyrean deities, the paladins’ orders are dedicated to the deified emperors, heroes, and prophets of Aura. The largest such order is the Knights of the Winged Sun, who hold as their patron the exalted hero-king Valerian Bellësareus.

###### Combat Characteristics

Paladins are highly trained combatants specialized in fighting as heavy infantry and heavy cavalry. They lack the versatility of fighters.

**Combat Proficiencies:** Paladins have weapon proficiency with all swords (including daggers, short swords, swords, and two-handed swords) and all spears (including lances, javelins, polearms, and spears). They have armor proficiency with all armor. They have fighting style proficiency with all fighting styles.

**Combat Progression:** Paladin advance in attack throws and saving throws by two points every three levels of experience. They increase their base damage roll from successful melee attacks (but not missile attacks) by +1 at 1st level, and by an additional +1 at 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th level. They can cleave after killing a foe a maximum of once per round per class level.

| 14 | 4+ | 5+ | 6+ | 7+ | 8+ | 1+ |

###### Starting Class Powers

In exchange for their devotion to Law, paladins receive many powers to aid them in their crusades against Chaos. At the start of play, paladins have the following class powers:

**Aura of Protection:** Paladins are protected by a magical aura that grants them a +1 bonus to AC and a +1 bonus to saving throws against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures. The paladin’s aura of protection appears as a golden halo when viewed with *discern good, discern magic,* or *true seeing.*

**Lay on Hands:** By calling on the higher powers of Law, the paladin can lay on hands to heal injuries. If he lays hands on a wounded creature, he can restore 2 hit points per experience level. If he lays hands on an incapacitated creature, he can grant a bonus to their Mortal Wounds throw of one-half his class level (round up). If he lays hands on a paralyzed creature, he can cure the paralysis. The paladin can use his power to lay on hands once per day. He can select the Laying on Hands proficiency to gain additional uses of the power per day. (This class power is the equivalent of one rank of Laying on Hands proficiency).

**Manual of Arms:** The paladin is highly experienced in military discipline, physical fitness, and weapon drill. He can automatically identify the battle standards, equipment, great captains, military slang, and rank insignia of his homeland. He can identify those of other realms with a proficiency throw of 11+. He can fight as a regular (rather than irregular) troop in formed and loose units. He can begin play as a member of a legion, mercenary’s guild, or other military organization (Judge’s discretion). (This class power is equivalent to one rank of the Manual of Arms proficiency.)

**Sanctified Body:** Paladins are completely immune to the ravages of disease, including magical diseases. This enables them to go on long crusades without succumbing to the illnesses that kill many soldiers, as well as to face dread foes such as mummies or werewolves without fear of corruption. (This class power is the equivalent of the Divine Health proficiency.)

**Sense Evil:** The paladin can detect creatures with evil intentions, magic items with evil enchantments, sinkholes of evil, enchanted creatures of Chaotic alignment, incarnations of Chaotic alignment, and undead within 45’. Other types of creatures, even if Chaotic, are not detected unless they have actively evil intentions against the paladin. Poisons, physical traps, and natural animals are neither good nor evil, so they are not detected by this spell. The paladin sees the evil creatures or objects with a sinister red glow around them, but the glow cannot be seen by anyone else. The paladin must have line of sight on the evil (e.g. the power does not work through walls). If the creature or object is hidden or invisible, the paladin will only see the glow and not the source of the evil. Sensing evil requires one full round of quiet concentration to activate. The effect lasts as long as the paladin continues to concentrate, to a maximum of one round per level. The effect can be used once per turn (10 minutes). (This class power is the equivalent of the Sensing Evil proficiency.)

###### Additional Class Powers

When they advance in level, paladins gain the following additional class powers:

**Holy Fervor (5th level):** The paladin’s presence inspires troops he leads. Any hirelings of the same religion as the paladin gain a +1 bonus to their morale score whenever he personally leads them. This bonus stacks with any modifiers from the paladin’s Charisma or proficiencies.

**Fortress (9th level):** By acquiring a **fortress** or other stronghold worth at least 15,000gp, the paladin can attract followers to his service. 5d6 x 10 0th level troops and 1d6 paladins of 1st – 3rd level arrive to serve him within 1d3 months of him acquiring the fortress. If the paladin already has a fortress, the followers arrive to serve him within 1d3 months of him reaching 9th level. The paladin must pay his followers the ordinary rates for mercenaries and henchmen or they leave his service. In time, the paladin might become a great lord, commanding armies to conquer vast realms. Additional rules for fortresses are detailed in the **Campaigns** chapter (p. XX).

###### Class Proficiencies

**Proficiency Progression:** At 1st level, paladins select one class proficiency from their class proficiency list and one general proficiency from the general proficiency list. They select an additional class proficiency at 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th level. They select an additional general proficiency at 5th, 9th, and 13th level.

**Paladin Proficiency List:** Alertness, Beast Friendship, Berserkergang, Blind Fighting, Combat Ferocity, Combat Reflexes, Combat Trickery (force back, incapacitate, overrun, sunder), Command, Diplomacy, Divine Blessing, Dungeonbashing Expertise, Fighting Style Specialization, Goblin-Slaying, Healing, Illusion Resistance, Laying on Hands, Leadership, Manual of Arms, Martial Training, Military Strategy, Mounted Combat, Mystic Aura, Riding, Running, Weapon Focus

**Notes:** The vanguard’s glaive is a type of polearm.

### Priestess

Key Attribute: WIL and CHA

Requirements: None

Hit Dice: 1d4

Maximum Level: 14

Priestesses are human women that have dedicated themselves to the service of a goddess. Unlike crusaders, who are trained in fighting, priestesses belong to non-military orders, and dedicate themselves to spell-casting, ministry, and prayer. Within the Auran Empire, priestesses belong to the Sisters of Mourning (Calefa), Keepers of the Hearth (Mityara), or Temple of the Veil (Ianna).

Most priestesses do not become adventurers, but every year a few women are sent forth from their temples into the world at the instructions of the matriarchs. Most of these priestesses fall prey to the world or its temptations, but a few rise in power and broaden the reach and influence of their order.

| \*No adjustment from Constitution applies to this flat bonus. | | | | | | | | | | |

###### Combat Characteristics

As healers and missionaries of their goddesses, priestesses receive little combat training.

**Combat Proficiencies:** Priestesses have weapon proficiency with clubs, daggers, darts, and staffs. They have no proficiency with armor. They have fighting style proficiency with the two-handed weapon style (allowing them to use a staff with both hands), but not with the dual weapon or weaponand shield styles.

**Combat Progression:** Priestesses advance in attack throws only two points every six levels of experience (i.e. the same as mages), but they advance in saving throws by two points every fourlevels of experience (i.e. as crusaders). They do not gain any bonus to damage as they advance in level. They cannot cleave, regardless of their level.

| 13 – 14 | 6+ |

###### Starting Class Powers

At the start of play, priestesses have the following class powers. Priestesses of goddesses other than Mityara might replace the Consolation, Diplomacy, Lay on Hands, and Purity of the Body class powers with other abilities (Judge’s discretion).

**Consolation**: The priestess can console the faithful to better endure pain and suffering while they heal. Each use of the ability requires 1 turn (10 minutes), during which the target creature is reassured through prayer and pastoral guidance. Once consoled, the creature’s natural healing from resting is doubled for the next day. The priestess cannot console wounded creatures of a different alignment or religion, nor can she console creatures that aren’t sapient. This ability only applies to healing from resting.

**Diplomacy:** In order to carry out missionary work, priestesses are trained in the art of protocol. They receive a +1 bonus on all reaction rolls when they attempt to parley with intelligent creatures. (This class power is equivalent to one rank of Diplomacy proficiency.)

**Divine Magic:** Priestesses can manifest their goddess’s power in the form of divine spells, which are granted through prayer and worship. The number and levels of spells the priestess can cast in a single day are listed on the Priestess Spell Progression table. The priestess’s spell selection is limited to the spells in her order’s **repertoire** (which is different than that of the crusader). See the **Spells** chapter for a list of all available spells.

**Lay on Hands:** By calling on her goddess, the priestess can lay on hands to heal injuries. If she lays hands on a wounded creature, she can restore 2 hit points per experience level. If she lays hands on an incapacitated creature, she can grant a bonus to their Mortal Wounds throw of one-half his class level (round up). If she lays hands on a paralyzed creature, she can cure the paralysis. The priestess can use her power to lay on hands once per day. She can select the Laying on Hands proficiency to gain additional uses of the power per day. (This class power is the equivalent of one rank of Laying on Hands proficiency).

**Purity of the Body:** The goddess shelters her priestesses from the effects of pestilence, so they can better minister to the sick and dying. The priestess is immune to all forms of disease, including magical diseases caused by spells, mummies, or lycanthropes.

**Theology:** Every priestess receives religious instruction at an abbey, cloister, or temple. She can begin play as a member of a religious hierarchy (Judge’s discretion). She can acquire congregants through proselytizing. She can automatically identify religious symbols, spell signatures, trappings, and holy days of her own faith, and can recognize those of other faiths with a proficiency throw of 11+. Rare or occult cults might be harder to recognize. (This class power is the equivalent of one rank of Theology proficiency).

###### Additional Class Powers

When they advance in level, priestesses gain the following additional class powers:

**Minor Magical Research (5th level):** The priestess can scribe magical scrolls and brew potions.

**Cloister (9th level):** By acquiring a cloister worth at least 15,000gp, the priestess can attract followers to her service. If the priestess has had a good and noble adventuring career, the matriarch of her current cloister will pay for up to 15,000gp of the construction costs, provided that the new cloister remains a branch of the older cloister until the priestess reaches 12th level (at which time it will become independent). 1d2 x 10 1st level priestesses and 1d6 x 30 normal women who want to become priestesses arrive within 1d3 months of her acquiring the cloister. If the priestess has already established a cloister, the followers arrive within 1d3 months of her reaching 9th level. Every year, 80% of the previous year’s trainees will leave in frustration or find they lack the discipline for a life of faith, but 1d6 x 20 normal women will arrive to replace them. A normal woman in training typically takes 2 years to become a 1st level priestess. Additional rules for cloisters are detailed in the **Campaigns** chapter.

**Major Magical Research (9th level):** The priestess can create more powerful magic items such as weapons, rings, and staffs.

**Supreme Magical Research (11th level):** The priestess can learn and cast ritual divine spells of great power (7th, 8th, and 9th level) and craft magical constructs. If chaotic, the priestess can create necromantic servants and become undead. Rules for magic research can be found in the **Campaigns** chapter (p. XX).

###### Code of Behavior

Like crusaders, priestesses must uphold the strictures of their order and their goddess. If the Judge has not specified particular religious orders in his campaign, the default priestess is assumed to be from the Keepers of the Hearth Fire, the order devoted to Mityara, Goddess of Civilization and Mercy. The strictures of their order are many.

* The priestess must always wear the white mantles and shawls of their order when in public.
* The priestess must offer prayers to Mityara at dusk. Offering prayers requires one hour (6 turns).
* Every seventh day, the priestess must keep a flame lit throughout the night, representing the light of civilization.
* The priestess must refrain from the taking of human or demi-human life by any means. (Of course, beastmen, undead, and other monsters are abominations and should be put down!)
* The priestess must remain both chaste and celibate until she reaches the rank of Mother (7th level).
* The priestess must not use her divine magic for unlawful or chaotic purposes.

If a priestess ever falls from favor, due to violating the strictures of her faith, the goddess might impose penalties upon the priestess. As with crusaders, these penalties are entirely up to the Judge.

###### Class Proficiencies

**Proficiency Progression:** At 1st level, priestesses select one class proficiency from their class proficiency list and one general proficiency from the general proficiency list. They select an additional class proficiency at 4th, 8th, and 12th level. They select an additional general proficiency at 5th, 9th, and 13th level.

**Priestess Proficiency List:** Alchemy, Animal Husbandry, Arcane Dabbling, Armor Training, Beast Friendship, Bright Lore of Aura, Contemplation, Divine Blessing, Familiar, Healing, Illusion Resistance, Knowledge, Laying on Hands, Loremastery, Magical Engineering, Magical Music, Mastery of Enchantments & Illusions, Mystic Aura, Naturalism, Performance, Prestidigitation, Profession, Prophecy, Quiet Magic, Sensing Evil, Sensing Power, Syncretism, Unflappable Casting

### Shaman

Key Attribute: WIL and CON

Requirements: None

Hit Dice: 1d6

Maximum Level: 14

Shamans are the spiritual guides of tribal peoples. A shaman is responsible for the sacred needs of his tribe, mediating with the tribe’s ancestral spirits and totem animals, and conducting the tribe’s religious rituals. Through his relationship with sacred powers such as gods, powerful ancestors, and animal spirits, the shaman can heal the sick and afflicted, divine wise courses of action, and smite the enemies of his tribe. In the Auran Empire, members of the class might be druids of Rorn, rune-casters of Jutland, medicine men of the Skysos horse peoples, or witch doctors of the Ivory Kingdoms. While most shamans spend their entire lives with their tribe, some shamans are called to adventure by dreams and visions; others adventure out of a desire to learn secrets unavailable in their homelands. A few tragic shamans become adventures to gain the power necessary to avenge the destruction of their tribe.

###### Combat Characteristics

Shamans are skilled combatants, albeit not as good as fighters. They tend to be more lightly armored than crusaders and use only weapons that are common to their tribe or people.

**Combat Proficiencies:** Shamans have weapon proficiency with daggers, hand axes, short swords, sling-staffs, staffs, and spears. They have armor proficiency with light and very light armor. They have fighting style proficiency with the weapon and shield and two-handed weapon styles, but not with the dual weapon style.

**Combat Progression:** Shamans advance in attack throws and saving throws by two points every four levels of experience (i.e. the same progression as crusaders). They do not gain any bonus to damage as they advance in level. They can cleave after killing a foe a maximum of once per round per every two class levels (rounded down).

| 13 – 14 | 7+ | 4+ | 10+ | 7+ | 9+ | 4+ |

###### Starting Class Powers

At the start of play, shamans have the following class powers.

**Commune with Spirits:** As the intermediary between his tribe and the sacred powers that watch over them, the shaman has the ability to **commune with spirits** once per week. When using this power, he can choose between the ancestral spirits of his tribe, or the natural spirits of his current location. The spirits will answer three yes-or-no questions to the best of their ability. They are very wise regarding their tribal history or local area, but not omniscient, so they might not be able to answer some questions accurately. Such details are left to the Judge’s discretion. The ritual to commune with the ancestor spirits takes 1 turn to complete, during which time the shaman is “out of body” and entirely helpless. The ritual is so taxing that it can be performed but once per week. Once a year, on a particular sacred day (determined by the Judge), the shaman can ask twice the normal number of questions of his ancestors without angering them. Communing with the spirits in a sinkhole of evil is a dangerous and chaotic act that might violate his code of behavior or put him at risk of haunting or possession (Judge’s discretion).

**Divine Magic:** Shamans can manifest the power of their tribal gods and spirits in the form of divine spells, which are granted through prayer and worship. The number and levels of spells the shaman can cast in a single day are listed on the Shaman Spell Progression table. The shaman’s spell selection is limited to the spells in his order’s **repertoire** (which is different than that of the crusader). See the **Spells** chapter for a list of all available spells.

**Tribal Traditions:** Every shaman receives instruction in the sacred rites and religious traditions of his tribe. He can begin play as a shaman of an existing tribe in the region (Judge’s discretion). He can acquire congregants through proselytizing. He can automatically identify religious symbols, spell signatures, trappings, and holy days of his own tribal traditions, and can recognize those of other faiths with a proficiency throw of 11+. Rare or occult cults might be harder to recognize. (This class power is equivalent to one rank of Theology proficiency).

**Totem Animal:** Every shaman has a **totem animal** as a companion. The totem animal physically represents the shaman’s relationship with his sacred powers. The Totem Animals table, below, lists the benefits and abilities of several sample totems. The Judge can create additional totems at his discretion. The totem animal should be a creature appropriate to the character’s attributes and tribal traditions. For example, a shaman with high STR might have a bear totem, while a shaman with high WIL might have an owl totem and one with high CHA might choose an eagle totem. At a minimum, the shaman must possess an attribute of at least 9 in his totem animal’s key attribute. Over time, the shaman will come to resemble his totem animal. A wolf shaman might develop yellow eyes and sharp canines, while a bear shaman might grow husky and hirsute.

The totem animal has human-like intelligence, with Intellect equal to half the shaman’s Intellect. It can understand the shaman’s speech, and the shaman can understand his totem animal’s speech, though no one else can without resorting to *speak with beasts*.So long as the shaman upholds his tribal traditions, the totem animal will be utterly loyal to the shaman and will fight for him, perform services, and obey his commands.

While the totem animal is alive, the shaman receives the animal’s **totem benefit**. The totem benefit is a bonus proficiency related to the totem. For example, a shaman with a cobra totem animal has the Combat Reflexes proficiency so long as he is within 30’ of his totem animal.

Because it is partly a creature of the shaman’s own spirit, the totem animal always has a number of Hit Dice equal to one less than the shaman’s own (1/2 HD when the shaman is 1st level) with 4 hp per HD. If a totem animal has fewer Hit Dice than those normally possessed by such an animal, it will appear as a smaller, younger creature of its type. If it has more HD, it will appear as a larger, fiercer variant. The animal’s baseline characteristics are adjusted based on its current Hit Dice relative to the Hit Dice of an ordinary animal of its type:

* Attack throws are as a monster of its HD; saving throws are as a fighter of half its HD.
* AC increases or decreases by 1 per 2 HD of difference, to a minimum of 0 and maximum of its own ordinary HD. (Round differences of 0.5 to even).
* Average damage for its attack routine (as a whole) increases or decreases by 2 per HD of difference. The Judge should decide how this is manifested, e.g. does it have a bigger bite, sharper claws, etc.

EXAMPLE: A shaman calls a lion totem animal. An ordinary lion has AC 3, HD 5, and an attack routine consisting of 2 claws (1d4+1) and 1 bite (1d10). Its average damage is (3.5 + 3.5 + 5.5) = 12.5 per attack routine. When the shaman is 1st level, his totem animal appears as a lion cub. It has 1/2 HD, making it 4.5 HD less than an ordinary lion. 4.5 is rounded to 4. AC is decreased by 1 per 2 HD of difference, so the lion cub’s AC is reduced from 3 to 1. Average damage decreases by 2 per HD of difference, so average damage is reduced by 8 points, from 12.5 to 4.5 The Judge decides it attacks with 2 claws (1d3-1) and 1 bite (1d4). When the shaman is 6th level, his totem animal has 5 HD, so it has the characteristics of an ordinary lion. When the shaman is 14th level, his totem animal has 13 HD, making it 8 HD more than an ordinary lion. AC is increased by 4, capped at its ordinary HD of 5. Average damage is increased by 16, to 28.5. the Judge decides it attacks with 2 claws (2d6) and 1 bite (3d8+1).

If the totem animal is ever killed, the shaman must save versus Death or instantly take damage equal to the totem animal’s maximum total hit points. If a shaman’s totem animal is slain, it can’t be *restored**to**life*or *resurrected*.However, a new totem animal of the same type will appear the next time the shaman gains a level of experience. Except where mentioned above, totem animals have the characteristics of a normal animal of their type. These are listed on the Totem Animals table for quick reference; see the ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual***for full details. HD are listed for comparison purposes. The Judge can devise new totem animals if desired.

###### Additional Class Powers

When they advance in level, shamans gain the following additional class powers:

**Spiritual Ritual (3rd level):** The shaman can perform a spiritual ritual to re-gain the ability to cast a spell of a level he had previously expended. Each spiritual ritual requires one hour (6 turns). In contrast to the austere contemplation of more civilized crusaders, spiritual rituals involve ecstatic dancing, wild drumming, chanting, and intoxicating smoke. The shaman can perform a spiritual ritual as often as desired, but cannot regain the same level of spell more than once per day.

**Minor Magical Research (5th level):** At 5th level or higher, the shaman can scribe scrolls and brew potions.

**Shapechanging (5th level):** The physical link between the shaman and his totem becomes strong enough for the shaman to **shapechange** into his totem animal. The shaman remains in his new shape until he changes back. A 5th level shaman can initially shapechange once per day. For example, if he begins the day in human form, he can shapechange into his totem animal form, but he then has to remain in totem animal form until the following day, when he can change back to his human shape. With each level of experience gained, the shaman can change shape one additional time per day.

When in totem animal form, the shaman has the movement, armor class, attacks, damage, and powers listed on the Totem Animals table. He retains his normal Hit Dice, hit points, attack throws, and saving throws. If the shaman is of greater Hit Dice than his animal type, he will appear as a bigger, stronger version of the animal, to a maximum of twice normal size. For example, a 10th level shaman in lion shape would appear as a huge predator, twice the mass of a normal lion. Apart from size, the shaman is indistinguishable from a normal animal. The totem animal shape does not detect as magical, is not detected by spells that reveal illusions, and cannot be **dispelled**. Changing shape can be performed during combat as an action in lieu of an attack.

**Spiritwalking (7th level):** The shaman’s spiritual powers have grown strong enough for him to spiritwalk. After 1 turn (10 minutes) of chanting, the shaman enters a deep trance during which his spirit walks free of his body. A spiritwalking shaman’s spirit can assume either human or totem animal shape as desired. The effects are otherwise identical to the 5th level spell *spiritwalk.* Spiritwalking is so taxing that it can be performed but once per week.

**Major Magical Research (9th level):** The shaman can create more powerful magic items such as weapons, rings, and staffs.

**Medicine Lodge (9th level):** By acquiring a **medicine lodge** worth at least 15,000gp, the shaman can attract followers to his service. So long as the shaman is currently in favor with his tribe’s powers, he can build his lodge at half the normal price due to divine intervention. 5d6 x 10 0th level tribesmen and 1d6 shamans of 1st level of the same tribe arrive to serve him within 1d3 months of him acquiring the medicine lodge. If the shaman has already acquired a medicine lodge, the followers arrive to serve him within 1d3 months of him reaching 9th level. The followers are fanatically brave and completely loyal (loyalty +4 and morale +4). Despite their loyalty, the followersmust be paid a fair wage or they might eventually leave his service. Additional rules for medicine lodges are detailed in the **Campaign** chapter.

**Supreme Magical Research (11th level):** The shaman can learn and cast ritual divine spells of great power (7th, 8th, and 9th level) and craft magical constructs. XX).

###### Code of Behavior

Shamans must uphold the traditions of their ancestors and the gods and spirits they serve. Each shaman’s traditions are determined by the Judge based on the character’s origination and history. If the Judge has not specified particular tribes and traditions for his campaign, the following traditions apply:

* The shaman must always display a holy symbol of his tribe and totem somewhere on his person when in public.
* The shaman must make offerings of food and drink to his tribe’s ancestors, gods, and spirits at dusk each day. Offering food and drink requires one hour (6 turns). The offering costs 1cp and weighs 1/6 st.
* The shaman must strive to uphold the noble virtues of his totem. For instance, a bear shaman must strive to be fierce and stalwart, a dog shaman must strive to be alert and loyal, and so on.
* The shaman must not wield strange weapons foreign to his tribe.
* The shaman must not use his divine magic for purposes that would damage or dishonor his tribe, or to deliberately or negligently cause harm to the animals he calls to serve him.

If a shaman ever falls from favor by failing to uphold the tribal traditions, the gods and spirits he serves might impose penalties upon him. As with crusaders, these penalties are entirely up to the Judge.

###### Class Proficiencies

**Proficiency Progression:** At 1st level, shamans select one class proficiency from their class proficiency list and one general proficiency from the general proficiency list. They select an additional class proficiency at 4th, 8th, and 12th level. They select an additional general proficiency at 5th, 9th, and 13th level.

**Shaman Proficiency List:** Animal Husbandry, Animal Training, Battle Magic, Beast Friendship, Berserkergang, Command, Diplomacy, Divine Blessing, Divine Health, Elementalism, Fighting Style Specialization, Healing, Laying on Hands, Leadership, Loremastery, Magical Engineering, Magical Music, Naturalism, Passing Without Trace, Prestidigitation, Quiet Magic, Sensing Evil, Sensing Power, Syncretism, Theology, Tracking, Unflappable Casting, Weapon Focus

### Warlock

Key Attributes: INT and WIL

Requirements: None

Hit Dice: 1d4

Maximum Level: 14

While mages are sometimes colloquially referred to as warlocks, the true warlock is a far more sinister individual. A warlock is one who seeks alliance with dark beings and pursues forbidden lore, hoping to find a quicker, easier path to power than the methodical practices of magecraft. Many warlocks become adventurers to plumb the secrets of dusty tombs, forgotten crypts, and hidden sanctums. Few do so for heroic motives.

These practices leave warlocks reviled and condemned in the Auran Empire. The Tower of Knowledge bars known warlocks from its august halls entirely. Warlocks are treated with respect and more than a little fear in the Sunset Kingdoms of Kemesh, Somirea, and Celdorea, and many assume positions of power in those societies.

###### Combat Characteristics

Because of their devotion to arcane study, warlocks receive limited combat training. They are quite vulnerable to physical danger, and in an adventuring group they should be protected.

**Combat Proficiencies:** Warlocks have weapon proficiency with daggers, darts, staffs, and whips. They have no armor proficiency. They have fighting style proficiency with the two-handed weapon style (allowing them to use a staff with both hands), but not with the dual weapon or weaponand shield styles.

**Combat Progression:** Warlocks advance in attack throws and saving throws by only two points every six levels of experience (i.e., the same progression as mages). They do not gain any bonus to damage as they advance in level. They cannot cleave, regardless of their level.

| 13 – 14 | 9+ | 9+ | 11+ | 7+ | 8+ | 6+ |

###### Starting Class Powers

At the start of play, warlocks have the following class powers.

**Arcane Magic:** Warlocks can learn and cast powerful arcane spells. The number and levels of spells the warlock can cast in a single day are listed on the Warlock Spell Progression table. A warlock’s spell selection is limited to the spells in his **repertoire**. A warlock’s repertoire can include the number of spells up to the number and level of spells listed for his level, increased by his Intellect bonus. More information on casting spells and individual spell descriptions can be found in the **Spells** chapter.

**Dark Path:** Every warlock has chosen to follow a dark path. There are three darks path available: **demonology**, **necromancy**, and **transmogrification**. Each dark path rewards the warlock with one class power at 1st level and one additional class power at 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, and 11th level. The rewards granted are determined by the warlock’s choice of path. When the warlock is created, select the character’s dark path from options listed below or talk with your Judge about the patrons available in his campaign setting.

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Tradition** | **Region** | **Description** |
| Demonology | Auran Empire, Jutland | Diabolists who call on the demonic power of the Outer Darkness. |
| Necromancy | Kemesh | Morbid practitioners of the forbidden craft of necromancy. |
| Transmogrification | Rorn, Southern Argollë | Sculptors of flesh who create living horrors. |

**Occultism:** Every warlock has studied the forbidden secrets of the occult. On a proficiency throw of 11+, he can name the popular titles and symbols of chthonic powers; identify the type of undead creature encountered; and otherwise recall information of interest to demonology and necromancy. (This class power counts as one rank of Knowledge (Occult) proficiency).

###### Additional Class Powers

When they advance in level, warlocks gain the following additional class powers:

**Dark Path II (3rd level):** The warlock’s dark path grants him his second reward.

**Dark Path III (5th level):** The warlock’s dark path grants him his third reward.

**Minor Magical Research (5th level):** The warlock can research spells, scribe magical scrolls, and brew potions.

**Dark Path IV (7th level):** The warlock’s dark path grants him his fourth reward.

**Dark Path V (9th level:** The warlock’s dark path grants him his fifth reward.

**Major Magical Research (9th level):** The warlock can create more powerful magic items such as weapons, rings, and staffs.

**Sanctum (9th level):** By acquiring a **sanctum** (often a great tower) worth at least 15,000gp, the warlock can attract followers to his service. 1d6 apprentices of 1st – 3rd level plus 2d6 apprentices of 0th level arrive to serve him as followers within 1d3 months of him acquiring the sanctum. If the warlock already has a sanctum, the followers arrive to serve him within 1d3 months of him reaching 9th level. The apprentices function as assistants in magical research (see p. XXX). If performing magic research, the apprentices must be provided food and lodging, but need not be paid wages. (If asked to accompany the mage on adventure, the apprentices must be paid wages as henchmen.) If the warlock builds a **dungeon** beneath or near his sanctum, monsters will start to arrive to dwell within, often followed by adventurers seeking to fight them. Additional rules for **sanctums** are detailed in the **Campaigns** chapter (p. XX).

**Dark Path VI (11th level):** The warlock’s dark path grants him his sixth reward.

**Supreme Magical Research (11th level):** The warlock can learn and cast ritual arcane spells of great power (7th, 8th, and 9th level), craft magical constructs, and create magical cross-breeds. If chaotic, the warlock can create necromantic servants and become undead.

###### Dark Paths

Demonology

**Conjure Dark Powers (1st level):** When the demonologist casts summoning spells (such as*conjure fiend*or *summon**shadows*), the spell effects are calculated as if he were two caster levels higher than his actual level of experience. (This makes them harder to dispel.) If the character loses his concentration due to taking damage while controlling a conjured creature, he must make a Spells saving throw. If the save succeeds, he maintains his concentration. His eligibility to conduct research on summoning magic is determined as if he were two caster levels higher than actual. He gains a +2 bonus on magic research throws and increases his research rate by 10% when researching summoning magic. Conjure Dark Powers can stack with the Mastery of Conjuration and Summoning proficiency, such that the character’s summoning spells and research are calculated as if he were three (rather than two) caster levels higher and he gains a +2 bonus on his Spells saving throw to maintain concentration.

**Theology (3rd level):** The demonologist has become a cultist of the chthonic powers. He gains one rank of the Theology proficiency.

**Conjure Hellion (5th level):** The demonologist has made pacts with demon lords. He can cast *conjure hellion*once per day.

**Expanded Repertoire (7th level):**The demonologist gains an expanded repertoire, increasing the number of slots in his repertoire of each level that he can cast by one. He must learn the specific spells separately. The additional spells must be conjuration or summoning spells, learned either from studying existing spells or by magic research of new spells.

**Words of Command and Obedience (9th):** The demonologistcan compel his conjured and summoned creatures to obey his inexorable will. Any creatures summoned by the demonologist will obey him to the best of their ability rather than seek to pervert his intention. Any creatures he conjures will depart without harming him if his concentration is broken.

**Power of Sacrifice (11th level):** Bargaining with the infernal powers has taught the demonologist the power of sacrifice. He can gain arcane power by blood sacrifice, and counts any arcane power from blood sacrifice as double its gp value. He can store the arcane power from blood sacrifices indefinitely, even when not actively performing magical research. See the rules for Arcane Power (p. XX) and Blood Sacrifice (p. XX).

Necromancy

**Secrets of the Dark Arts (1st):** The necromancer can control undead as a Chaotic crusader of one half his class level. If the character casts death spells, his targets suffer a -2 penalty on their saving throws. When the character casts necromantic spells (such as *animate undead*), the spell effects are calculated as if he were two class levels higher than his actual level of experience. His eligibility to research death or necromancy magic is determined as if he were two caster levels higher than actual. He gains a +2 bonus on magic research throws and increases his research rate by 10% when researching death or necromancy magic. Secrets of the Dark Arts can stack with the Black Lore of Zahar proficiency, such that the character can control undead as a crusader of two-thirds his class level (rounded up), and his death and necromancy spells and research are calculated as if he were three (rather than two) caster levels higher than his actual caster level.

**Mortuary Science (3rd):** The necromancer has undertaken a deep study of anatomy, circulation, disease, and vitality. He gains one rank of the Healing proficiency.

**Speak with Dead (5th)***:* The dead hold no secrets for the necromancer. He can cast *speak with the dead*once per day.

**Expanded Repertoire (7th level):**The necromancer gains an expanded repertoire, increasing the number of slots in his repertoire of each level that he can cast by one. He must learn the specific spells separately. The additional spells must be death and necromancy spells, learned either from studying existing spells or by magic research of new spells.

**Lordship Over the Undead (9th)***:* In black tomes and evil liturgies, the necromancer has gained lordship over the undead. Whenever the character succeeds in controlling undead (whether from a roll or automatically from a “R” result), the undead are controlled for 1 day per level instead of the usual 1 turn per level. If the undead would have been controlled for 1 day per level (from a “D” result), the undead are instead controlled indefinitely.

**Secrets of Life and Death (11th):** The necromancer has finally unlocked the secrets of life and death. He can perform necromancy at half the usual material cost and research cost.

Transmogrification

**Grotesque Arts of Transformation (1st):** When the character casts transmogrification spells, the spell effects are calculated as if he were two class levels higher than his actual level of experience. His eligibility to create crossbreeds or research transmogrification magic is determined as if he were two caster levels higher than actual. Targets of his transmogrification spells suffer a -2 penalty to their saving throw. He gains a +2 bonus on magic research throws and increases his research rate by 10% when creating crossbreeds or researching transmogrification magic. Grotesque Arts can stack with the Transmogrification proficiency, such that the character’s transmogrification spells are calculated as if he were three (rather than two) caster levels higher and his bonus to magic research and research rate is increased to +3 and 15%.

**Alchemy (3rd level)**:To master the art of transmogrification one must unravel the secrets of alchemy. The character gains one rank of the Alchemy proficiency.

**Skinchange (5th level)**: The transmogrifier has learned to transcend his own form. He can cast *skinchange*once per day.

**Expanded Repertoire (7th level):**The transmogrifier gains an expanded repertoire, increasing the number of slots in his repertoire of each level that he can cast by one. He must learn the specific spells separately. The additional spells must be transmogrification spells, learned either from studying existing spells or by magic research of new spells.

**Hideous Servant (9th level):** Experiments combining living creatures with the transmogrifier’s own flesh and blood have created a hideous servantintimately bonded to his will. The hideous servant is mechanically similar to a shaman’s totem animal (see p. XX).However, the sorcerer selects two of his hideous servant’s characteristics (AC, movement, attack routine, and special abilities) from one animal and two characteristics from another, while the servant’s base Hit Dice are set to the average of the two animals selected. (Remember that actual HD will be adjusted by the character’s level.) He does not gain a totem benefit.

**Shape Flesh and Bone (11th level):** The transmogrifier can mold flesh and bone like clay. The character is able to create magical crossbreeds at half the usual material cost and research cost.

###### Corrupting Weaknesses

Though it grants them great power, the dark path tread by the warlock carries a terrible cost. At 1st level, and again at 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, and 11th level, the warlock is afflicted by a **corrupting weakness.** The Judge can pick from the list below or ask the player to roll 1d10:

1. **Disfigured:** Sorcerous studies have begun to make the warlock a monstrous figure, leaving him misshapen limbs, clawed hands or feet, hideous scarring, strangely colored eyes, and so on. Each disfigurement imposes a -2 penalty to reaction rolls with sapient creatures of Lawful or Neutral alignment.
2. **Distrusted**: Lore best left unstudied has twisted the warlock’s demeanor and personality. A reaction roll with sapient creatures of Lawful or Neutral alignment can never achieve a friendly (12+) result. Each time this weakness is selected thereafter, reduce the best possible reaction roll by one further step.
3. **Enervated**: The warlock’s exploration of sinister sorcery has sapped his soul of strength and vigor. His Constitution is reduced by 2 points each time this weakness occurs.
4. **Frightening to Beasts:** The warlock’s corruption is unsettling to animals. They growl, hiss, rear up, and otherwise make their displeasure known whenever he is within 10’. The warlock suffers a -4 reaction roll when encountering animals or giant animals. He cannot ride normal mounts. Characters with Beast Friendship proficiency (or related class powers) can detect something is unnatural about the warlock, but do not suffer a reaction roll penalty. If the warlock himself had Beast Friendship proficiency, the proficiency’s effects now only help when dealing with wild predators and scavengers, such as wolves and vultures (in which cases the above penalty will not apply).
5. **Haunted:** Whispers from the beyond plague the warlock. They are difficult to ignore, and impose a -2 penalty to listening throws and -1 penalty to initiative and surprise rolls. The penalty is cumulative each time this weakness occurs.
6. **Mad:** So disturbing are the warlock’s dark secrets that he has begun to lose his grip on reality. Each day he must make a Spells saving throw or go **mad** for 1 – 10 hours. The warlock’s first saving throw against madness is at +20, but each consecutive saving throw is one point less advantaged. When the warlock goes mad, he falls under the Judge’s control for 1d10 hours, during which time his behavior is entirely unpredictable. The day after a bout of madness, the warlock resumes his saving throws with a +20 bonus.
7. **Mutated:** The corrupting influences of dark magic have begun to warp the warlock’s body. The first time this weakness occurs, roll 1d10 on the Magical Mutations sub-table (p. XX). The second time it occurs, roll 1d10+1. The third time it occurs, roll 1d10+2, and so on.
8. **Nocturnal:** Creatures of darkness and evil hunt by night, and sleep by day. So too does the warlock. He cannot regain spells unless he sleeps during the day. Due to his nocturnal habits, he suffers a penalty of -2 to all throws when in sunlight. This penalty is increased by an additional 2 points each time this weakness occurs.
9. **Obsessed:** The warlock’s self-control and will begin to erode in the face of ongoing corruption. His Will is reduced by 2 points each time this weakness occurs.
10. **Sleepless:** Haunted by nightmares and disturbing visions of the grave, the warlock finds it hard to sleep. Each time he attempts to rest, he must roll 1d6. On a 1, the warlock tosses and turns all night, regaining no hit points and recovering no spells. The chance of sleeplessness increases by 1 each time this weakness occurs, to a maximum of five times.

###### Class Proficiencies

**Proficiency Progression:** At 1st level, warlocks select one class proficiency from their class proficiency list and one general proficiency from the general proficiency list. They select an additional class proficiency at 6th and 12th level. They select an additional general proficiency at 5th, 9th, and 13th level.

**Warlock Proficiency List**: Alchemy, Battle Magic, Beast Friendship, Black Lore of Zahar, Counterspelling, Divine Blessing, Elementalism, Elven Bloodline, Expanded Repertoire, Experimenting, Familiar, Illusion Resistance, Knowledge, Language, Loremastery, Magical Engineering, Mastery of Enchantments & Illusions, Mastery of Conjuration & Summoning, Mystic Aura, Naturalism, Poisoning, Prestidigitation, Quiet Magic, Sensing Good, Sensing Power, Soothsaying, Transmogrification, Unflappable Casting

For characters with INT of less than 13 or greater than 15, see the **Intellect Scores of Arcane Spellcasters** section earlier in this Chapter.

### Witch

Key Attribute: INT and WIL

Requirements: None

Hit Dice: 1d4

Maximum Level: 14

The ignorant will often refer to any female spellcaster as a witch. Actual witches, however, are women who practice a distinct craft of magic. Like priestesses and shamans, witches invoke divine magic, but they do not organize into communities of faith nor do they dedicate themselves to the service of their gods or goddesses. Rather, they seek to gain personal knowledge and strength by bartering with the old powers of the world. Through ancient pacts, forgotten prayers, secret names of power, and other means, they appease, bargain, coerce, convince, and harness divine power to their own ends. Their quest for knowledge and power often drives witches to become adventurers.

Within the Auran Empire, witches are viewed with deep suspicion by the Empyrean priests, but many rural villages nevertheless have a wise woman with some skill in witchcraft. Witches are fairly common in Southern Argollë, Jutland, Rorn, Kemesh, and the Ivory Kingdoms, each of which has flourishing traditions of witchcraft.

###### Combat Characteristics

Witches are devoted to their craft and receive little combat training.

**Combat Proficiencies:** Witches have weapon proficiency with clubs, daggers, darts, and staffs. They have no proficiency with armor. They have fighting style proficiency with the two-handed weapon style (allowing them to use a staff with both hands), but not with the dual weapon or weaponand shield styles.

**Combat Progression:** Witches advance in attack throws only two points every six levels of experience (i.e. the same as mages), but they advance in saving throws by two points every fourlevels of experience (i.e. as crusaders). They do not gain any bonus to damage as they advance in level. They cannot cleave, regardless of their level.

###### Starting Class Powers

At the start of play, witches have the following class powers.

**Studious Divine Magic:** By reminding the gods of ancient pacts and coercing them with forgotten prayers and binding hymns, witches can cast divine spells. Unlike most other divine casters, who receive their spells from prayer, witches receive their spells from study. Witches follow the same spell progression and use the same rules for learning and casting spells as mages. They record their repertoires of spells in spell books and can learn new spells from scribing scrolls or studying other divine spell books. They select their spells from the divine spell list, rather than the arcane spell list, however, and cannot learn or cast spells found in arcane spell books. See p. XX for more details on studious divine spellcasting.

**Tradition:** Every witch belongs to a **tradition**, which defines her approach to the magic and her relationship with the gods and spirits that are her source of power. The regions within the Auran Empire campaign setting associated with each tradition are noted below. Judges can create other traditions for their own campaign settings where necessary.

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Tradition** | **Region** | **Description** |
| Antiquarian | Auran Empire, Jutland, Ivory Kingdom | Wise women who focus on healing and beneficial potions, they practice their traditional craft wherever rural human settlements may be found. |
| Chthonic | Kemesh, Ivory Kingdom | Malefic practitioners who consort with the darkest of powers, reveling in the seduction and corruption of the innocent. |
| Sylvan | Rorn, Southern Argollë | Reclusive witches who travel the borderlands between human settlements and fey forests. |

She can acquire congregants through proselytizing. She can automatically identify religious symbols, spell signatures, trappings, and holy days of her own tradition, and can recognize those of other faiths with a proficiency throw of 11+. Rare or occult cults might be harder to recognize. (This class power counts as one rank of Theology proficiency). In addition, each tradition grants a special ability at 1st, 3rd, 5th, and 7th level.

**Village Wisdom (1st level):** All witches can perform minor acts of “hedge magic” useful in village life, such as alleviating cold symptoms, easing the pains of childbirth, driving away bedbugs from a mattress, removing mites and ticks from a creature, and so on. Each use takes 1 turn (10 minutes). (If your Judge is using the optional rules for cantrips from *Axioms,* this class power grants the witch the ability to learn and cast divine cantrips instead.)

###### Additional Class Powers

When they advance in level, witches gain the following additional class powers:

**Brew Potions (3rd level):** The witch can brew potions. However, she cannot yet research new spells or scribe scrolls.

**Minor Magical Research (5th level):** The witch can research new spells. However, she cannot yet scribe scrolls.

**Scribe Scrolls (7th level):** The witch can create magic scrolls.

**Witch’s Cottage (9th level:** By acquiring a cottage worth at least 15,000gp, the witch can attract followers to her service. 1d6 apprentices of 1st – 3rd level plus 2d6 apprentices of 0th level arrive to serve her as followers within 1d3 months of her acquiring the cottage. If the witch already has a cottage, the followers arrive to serve her within 1d3 months of her reaching 9th level. The apprentices function as assistants in magical research (see p. XXX). If performing magic research, the apprentices must be provided food and lodging, but need not be paid wages. (If asked to accompany the witch on adventure, the apprentices must be paid wages as henchmen.) A normal woman in training typically takes 2 years to become a 1st level witch. Additional rules for witch’s cottages are detailed in the **Campaigns** chapter.

**Major Magical Research (9th level):** The witch can create more powerful magic items such as weapons, rings, and staffs.

**Supreme Magical Research (11th level):** The witch can learn and cast ritual divine spells of great power (7th, 8th, and 9th level) and craft magical constructs. If chaotic, the witch can create necromantic servants and become undead. Rules for magic research can be found in the **Campaigns** chapter (p. XX).

###### Traditions

Antiquarian Witch

**Traditional Medicine (1st level):** The antiquarian witch practices an ancient tradition of natural medicine using healing herbs. She can identify and forage for healing herbs as if she had one rank of Naturalism proficiency. (If she already has Naturalism, she gains a +4 bonus on proficiency throws to identify and forage for healing herbs.) She can use healing herbs as if she had Healing proficiency. Given one turn (10 minutes), she can combine a pound of healing herbs with an equal gp of special components to create potent healing herbs that increase their effect by +1. The witch needs a cauldron over a fire or a kitchen to make potent healing herbs. The potent herbs lose all efficacy after 24 hours.

EXAMPLE: Bronwyn is an antiquarian witch. She has one pound of comfrey (10gp value), one pound of woundwort (10gp), and two marsh ghoul livers (10gp each). When her party camps for the night, she uses her Natural Medicine power. First, she mixes comfrey with ghoul liver to create potent comfrey that heals 1d3+1 damage. Then she mixes woundwort with ghoul liver to create potent woundwort that grants a +3 bonus to Healing throws. However, the herbs will lose their efficacy if not used within the next day.

**Healing Arts (3rd level):** The antiquarian witch’s knowledge of the healing arts deepens. She gains one rank of Healing proficiency. (If she already has three ranks of Healing proficiency, she can gain a rank of Alchemy or Naturalism instead.)

**Second Sight (5th level):** Because of the antiquarian witch’s connection with the hidden world, she can see innately or magically invisible creatures within 60’. Invisible creatures are aware that the witch can see them, and might take a particular interest in her as a result. Second Sight does not provide the ability to see creatures or features hidden through cover or darkness.

**Magic Mirror (7th level):** By directing her gaze onto a mirror, crystal, reflective pool, or other surface upon which the images can be displayed, the antiquarian witch can see visions of faraway people and places. She can cast *scry* (as the spell) once per day. Each use takes 1 turn (10 minutes). If the witch has *clairaudiency*or *telepathy*in her repertoire, she can cast either spell at the same time in order to use one of those spells while scrying.

Chthonic Witch

**Bedazzling Glamour (1st level)**: Vain and narcissistic, the chthonic witch has learned how to use magical glamour to conceal her imperfections. While active, the glamour grants her three benefits:

* The witch gains a +1 bonus to all reaction rolls. This bonus does not stack with Mystic Aura (though the other effects do).
* The witch does not suffer any age-related penalty to CHA.
* Permanent wounds or side effects that otherwise would cause a penalty to her reaction rolls are ignored.

Activating her glamour demands one turn (10 minutes) of concentration by the witch. Once activated, the glamour remains active until she ends it, is subject to a **dispel** effect, or is incapacitated. While the glamour is active, the witch radiates magic.

**Decadent Arts (3rd level):** The chthonic witch is a practiced seductress. She gains the Seduction proficiency. (If she already has Seduction, she can select Diplomacy or Intimidation instead.)

**Subtle Beguilement (5th level):** With subtle words of praise and disdain, the chthonic witch can beguile the weak-willed. When casting enchantment spells, the witch counts as having the Quiet Magic proficiency. If she already has Quiet Magic proficiency, she can cast enchantment spells using subvocalized words and no hand gestures. In either case, targets of her enchantment spells suffer a -2 penalty to their saving throw, or a -3 penalty if she also has Mastery of Enchantment & Illusions proficiency.

**Evil Eye (7th level):** The chthonic witch can hex a foe with the merest glance. She can *bestow curse* as a spell-like ability once per week. Because her Evil Eye is a spell-like ability and not a spell, she does not need to declare she is casting it before initiative, nor does taking damage or failing a saving throw prior to her initiative segment prevent her from using it.

Sylvan Witch

**Friend of Birds and Beasts (1st level):** From long years in the company of wild and fey things, the sylvan witch has gained the friendship of birds and beasts. She can identify plants and fauna with a proficiency throw of 11+. She can understand the vocalizations and body language of birds and beasts, enabling her to understand any simple messages the animals might be communicating (such as “danger is nearby, be alert,” “you’re unfamiliar and strange,” or “do not come closer, we are guarding our den!”). Because of her innate understanding of the language of beasts, the witch also counts as proficient for purposes of handling trained animals in their roles such as droving or shepherding. She gains +2 to all reaction rolls when encountering normal animals and can take animals as henchmen. She can train and handle animal henchmen to perform tricks or serve a particular role without having to separately possess Animal Training. If the witch also has the Beast Friendship proficiency, she can identify plants and fauna with a throw of 7+ and can take one more henchman than her Charisma would otherwise permit, as long as at least one is an animal. (The bonus to reaction rolls does not increase.)

**Natural Arts (3rd level)**: The sylvan witch knows the secrets of the woodlands. She gains the Naturalism proficiency. (If she already has Naturalism, she can take a second rank or select Alchemy or Healing instead.)

**Close Friend of Birds and Beasts (5th level):** The sylvan witch’s friendship with birds and beasts improves. She can *speak with beasts* (as the spell) at will. If she ever rolls Friendly reactions while speaking with small, cute animals such as songbirds, squirrels, and rabbits, the animals act as if *bewitched* in her presence.

**Enchanted Forest (7th level)**: The woodland home of a sylvan witch becomes a strange and magical place. She gains the power to cast *forest enchantment*(as the spell) once per week. Each use takes 1 turn (10 minutes). The sylvan witch can sustain a number of *forest enchantments* equal to her caster level, enabling her to enchant a vast swathe of territory (approximately 2 acres per level).

###### Code of Behavior

When a young woman first undertakes the study of witchcraft, she often believes she has discovered a path to freedom and power denied to others of her age and sex. And this is true – at first. A young witch only needs to interact with weak and enfeebled spiritual entities in order to cast her spells, and these beings she can dominate through sheer charisma and will. But as she begins to learn and cast more powerful spells, the witch must interact with increasingly powerful and ancient powers. These beings cannot be cajoled or coerced; they must be bargained with. Over time, the witch accumulates an increasing number of **obligations** to these beings, obligations that restrict her behavior as much as any priestess’s strictures.

A witch starts with one simple obligationat 1st level and gains an additional obligation each time she gains the ability to cast another level of spells. The obligations become increasingly severe at higher levels, with the exact nature of the obligations determined by the Judge based on the witch’s alignment, tradition, and spell repertoire. The following obligations would be suitable for an antiquarian witch of Lawful or Neutral alignment:

* 1st level: The witch must light a candle and pray over it for one turn (10 minutes) at noon and midnight.
* 3rd level: The witch cannot lie. She can equivocate, prevaricate, speak in riddles, or stay silent, however.
* 5th level: If the witch unjustly wrongs another human or demi-human, she must redress the wrong at threefold its value.
* 7th level: If the witch accepts a gift, she must offer a gift of threefold value to the gift giver.
* 9th level: If the witch suffers a personal wrong, she must exact retribution of threefold value from the one who wronged her.
* 11th level: The witch’s soul is sworn to service after death. She cannot be restored to life by any means short of a *wish* or *miracle*.

If a witch fails to uphold her obligations, the powers she is obligated to will certainly extract punishment. These penalties are entirely up to the Judge and might include curses, reductions in spells available, or even loss of some or all class powers entirely. To remove the penalties, the witch will have to atone for her violation by, e.g., sacrificing treasure, undertaking quests, or even receiving an **atonement** spell from a powerful caster of her order (Judge’s discretion).

###### Class Proficiencies

**Proficiency Progression:** At 1st level, witches select one class proficiency from their class proficiency list and one general proficiency from the general proficiency list. They select an additional class proficiency at 4th, 8th, and 12th level. They select an additional general proficiency at 5th, 9th, and 13th level.

**Witch Proficiency List:** Alchemy, Arcane Dabbling, Beast Friendship, Black Lore of Zahar, Contemplation, Divine Blessing, Divine Health, Elementalism, Elven Bloodline, Expanded Repertoire, Familiar, Illusion Resistance, Laying on Hands, Loremastery, Magical Engineering, Magical Music, Mastery of Enchantments & Illusions, Mystic Aura, Naturalism, Passing without Trace, Poisoning, Prestidigitation, Prophecy, Quiet Magic, Sensing Power, Soothsaying, Transmogrification, Unflappable Casting

## Demi-Human Classes

### Dwarven Craftpriest

Key Attribute: WIL

Requirements: CON 9

Hit Dice: 1d6

Maximum Level: 10

Nothing is so revered among the dwarven people as craftsmanship. A dwarf’s work is his life, and the spirits of great dwarven artisans are believed to live on forever in their masterpieces. The veneration of these relics falls to the care of a caste of dwarves known as craftpriests. While most craftpriests attend to the shrines and monuments of their clan, young craftpriests are sometimes sent forth to recover monuments to the glorious past from the ancient ruins and wastelands of the world.

###### Combat Characteristics

Craftpriests have some combat training in the traditional weapons of their people, but not as much as their warrior-kin, the vaultguards.

**Combat Proficiencies:** Craftpriests have weapon proficiency with all axes (including battle axes, great axes, and hand axes) and all bludgeons (including clubs, flails, maces, morning stars, and warhammers). They have armor proficiency with all armor. They have fighting style proficiency with the weapon and shield and two-handed weapon styles, but not with the dual weapon style.

**Combat Progression:** Craftpriests advance in attack throws and saving throws as crusaders, by two points every four levels of experience. They do not gain any bonus to damage as they advance in level. They can cleave after killing a foe a maximum of once per round per every two class levels (rounded down).

| **Level** | **Paralysis** | **Death** | **Blast** | **Implements** | **Spells** | **Attack Throw** |
| 1 – 2 | 9+ | 6+ | 13+ | 9+ | 11+ | 10+ |

| 9 – 10 | 5+ | 2+ | 9+ | 5+ | 7+ | 6+ |

###### Starting Class Powers

At the start of play, craftpriests have the following class powers.

**Attention to Detail:** Craftpriests gain a +3 bonus on proficiency throws for any proficiencies they learn. (This bonus has already been factored into the craftpriest’s class abilities.)

**Crafting:** Every craftpriest is a master in a particular type of craft, such as armor-making, leatherworking, weapon-smithing, etc. With access to craftsman’s tools, craftpriests can produce 40gp worth of items per month and supervise 2 journeymen and 4 apprentices in their craft. When examining works of his craft, craftpriests can identify masterwork items, rare materials, and famous artisans with a proficiency throw of 2+ on 1d20. (This class power is equivalent to three ranks of Craft proficiency.)

**Rebuke Undead:** Craftpriests can rebuke undead as crusaders of their class level (p. XX). In order to rebuke undead, they must be equipped with a holy symbol representing the ancestor or relic they venerate.

**Studious Divine Magic:** By invoking the rites and rituals of their venerable ancestors, craftpriests can cast divine spells. Unlike most other divine casters, who receive their spells from prayer, craftpriests receive their spells from study. Craftpriests follow the same spell progression and use the same rules for learning and casting spells as mages. They record their repertoires of spells in spell books and can learn new spells from scribing scrolls or studying other divine spell books. They select their spells from the divine spell list, rather than the arcane spell list, however, and cannot learn or cast spells found in arcane spell books. See p. XX for more details on studious divine spellcasting.

**Theology:** Craftpriests are trained in the rites and rituals of the dwarven faith and are broadly knowledgeable about other races’ and cultures’ religions. They can acquire congregants through proselytizing. They can automatically identify religious symbols, trappings, and holy days of the dwarven faith, and recognize those of other faiths with a proficiency throw of 8+ on 1d20. (This class power is equivalent to one rank of Theology proficiency.)

###### Additional Class Powers

When they advance in level, craftpriests gain the following additional class powers:

**Minor Magical Research (5th level):** The craftpriest can research spells, scribe scrolls, and brew potions.

**Major Magical Research (9th level):** The craftpriest can create permanent magic items, such as weapons, rings, and staffs. He can also craft magical constructs such as golems.

**Vault (9th level):** By acquiring a **vault** worth at least 15,000gp, the craftpriest can attract dwarves to his service. 1d4+1 x 10 dwarven mercenaries and 1d6 dwarven craftpriests of 1st – 3rd level arrive to serve him as followers within 1d3 months of him acquiring the vault. If the craftpriest has already acquired a vault, the followers arrive to serve him within 1d3 months of him reaching 9th level. The craftpriest must pay his followers the ordinary rates for mercenaries and henchmen or they leave his service. Additional rules for vaults are detailed in the **Campaigns** chapter (p. XX).

###### Racial Traits

As dwarves, craftpriests have certain powers and drawbacks associated with their race.

**Dwarf Tongues:** Dwarves can speak the Common and Dwarvish tongues and, because of their frequent interaction underground with beastmen, can also speak Goblin, Gnome, and Kobold.

**Hardy:** Dwarves are tough. The target values for all their Blast saving throws are improved by 3, while the target values for all their other saving throws are improved by 4. (These adjustments are already factored into the saving throws on the Dwarven Craftpriest Attack and Saving Throws table below.)

**Sensitivity to Rock and Stone:** Dwarves gain a +1 bonus to surprise rolls when underground. When using Adventuring proficiency to search or listen, they succeed on a proficiency throw of 14+ (instead of the usual 18+). If separately proficient in Searching they gain a +4 bonus to their throw instead. If separately proficient in Listening, they gain a +2 bonus to their throw instead.

###### Code of Behavior

Every dwarven craftpriest must uphold the strictures of the sacred order to which he belongs. The particular strictures that any given craftpriest follows can vary depending on his clan and vault, but most obey the following strictures:

* The craftpriest must always display a holy symbol indicating the relic he venerates somewhere on his person when in public.
* The craftpriest must sing hymns on high holy days each week. Singing hymns requires one hour of ancillary activity.
* The craftpriest must only use the traditional weapons of the dwarves.
* If the craftpriest discovers a dwarven relic in the hands of outsiders, he must recover the relic by any means necessary. If he has guardianship of a dwarven relic, he must protect the relic even at the cost of his own life. If he loses the relic, he must recover it from the one who took it, or take everything else from him – or his descendants.
* The craftpriest must not use his divine magic to harm or hinder fellow dwarves, unless ordered to do so by a superior during a time when his vault is at war with another vault.

If a craftpriest ever violates the strictures of his order, the ancestral spirits he venerates might impose penalties upon him. These penalties are entirely up to the Judge and might include penalties to turning throws, a reduction in spells available, or even a loss of all class powers altogether. To remove the penalties, the craftpriest will have to atone for his violation by, e.g., sacrificing treasure, undertaking quests, or even receiving an **atonement** spell from a powerful caster of his order (Judge’s discretion).

For more information on the customs and traditions of the craftpriest, see the sourcebook *By This Axe: The Cyclopedia of Dwarven Civilization*.

###### Class Proficiencies

**Proficiency Progression:** At 1st level, craftpriests select one class proficiency from their class proficiency list and one general proficiency from the general proficiency list. They select an additional class proficiency at 4th and 8th level. They select an additional general proficiency at 5th and 9th level.

**Dwarven Craftpriest Proficiency List:** Alchemy, Battle Magic, Caving, Collegiate Wizardry, Contemplation, Craft, Diplomacy, Divine Blessing, Divine Health, Dwarven Brewing, Engineering, Expanded Repertoire, Experimenting, Fighting Style Specialization, Goblin-Slaying, Healing, Illusion Resistance, Knowledge, Laying on Hands, Loremastery, Magical Engineering, Mapping, Prestidigitation, Profession (judge), Prophecy, Quiet Magic, Reliquarianism, Righteous Rebuke, Sensing Evil, Siege Engineering, Theology, Unflappable Casting, Weapon Focus

**Notes:** The Craft proficiency that each craftpriest template begins with is noted in bold. For an explanation of caste, see ***By This Axe***. Some characters of this class have above average Intellect, and the templates above reflect that. Each template assumes that the character has an INT attribute of between 13 and 15, qualifying him for one bonus proficiency and one bonus spell. The bonus proficiency and bonus spell that each template begins with are noted last. For characters with INT of less than 13 or greater than 15, see the **Intellect Scores of Studious Spellcasters** section earlier in this Chapter.

### Dwarven Vaultguard

Key Attribute: STR

Requirements: CON 9

Hit Dice: 1d8

Maximum Level: 13

Dwarves trained to defend their race’s underground vault from the endless hordes that threaten it are called vaultguards. Though most vaultguards are born, live and die in the vault, from time to time a young vaultguard will be dispatched to foreign realms on a warrior’s pilgrimage. The few vaultguards who return from such pilgrimages bring gold and glory to their clans, often leading them to found new vaults and become great lords.

###### Combat Characteristics

Vaultguards are the most highly-trained combatants fielded by the dwarves.

**Combat Proficiencies:** Vaultguards have weapon proficiency with all weapons except long bows or two-handed swords (due to their short stature). They have armor proficiency with all armor. They have fighting style proficiency with the weaponand shield, two-handed weapon, and dual weapon styles.

**Combat Progression:** Vaultguards advance in attack throws and saving throws as fighters, by two points every three levels of experience. They increase their base damage roll from successful missile and melee attacks by +1 at 1st level, and by an additional +1 at 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th level. They can cleave after killing a foe a maximum of once per round per class level.

###### Starting Class Powers

At the start of play, vaultguards have the following class power:

**Manual of Arms:** The vaultguard is highly experienced in military discipline, physical fitness, and weapon drill. He can automatically identify the battle standards, equipment, great captains, military slang, and rank insignia of his clan and vault. He can identify those of other clans, vaults, or realms with a proficiency throw of 11+. He can fight as a regular (rather than irregular) troop in formed and loose units. He can begin play as a member of a legion, mercenary’s guild, or other military organization (Judge’s discretion). (This class power is equivalent to one rank of Manual of Arms proficiency.)

###### Additional Class Powers

When they advance in level, vaultguards gain the following additional class powers:

**Battlefield Prowess (5th level):** The vaultguard’s presence inspires troops he leads. Any henchmen and mercenaries hired by the vaultguard gain a +1 bonus to their morale score whenever he personally leads them. This bonus stacks with any modifiers from the vaultguard’s Charisma or proficiencies.

**Vault (9th level):** By acquiring a **vault** worth at least 15,000gp, the vaultguard can attract dwarves to his service. 3d6 x 10 1st level dwarven mercenaries arrive to serve him as followers within 1d3 months of him acquiring the vault. If the vaultguard already acquired a vault, the followers arrive to serve him within 1d3 months of him reaching 9th level. The vaultguard must pay his followers the ordinary rates for mercenaries and henchmen or they leave his service. Additional rules for vaults are detailed in the **Campaigns** chapter (p. XX).

###### Racial Traits

As dwarves, vaultguards have certain powers and drawbacks associated with their race.

**Dwarf Tongues:** Dwarves can speak the Common and Dwarvish tongues and, because of their frequent interaction underground with beastmen, can also speak Goblin, Gnome, and Kobold.

**Hardy:** Dwarves are tough. The target values for all their Blast saving throws are improved by 3, while the target values for all their other saving throws are improved by 4. (These adjustments are already factored into the saving throws on the Dwarven Vaultguard Attack and Saving Throws table.)

**Sensitivity to Rock and Stone:** Dwarves gain a +1 bonus to surprise rolls when underground. When using Adventuring proficiency to search or listen, they succeed on a proficiency throw of 14+ (instead of the usual 18+). If separately proficient in Searching they gain a +4 bonus to their throw instead. If separately proficient in Listening, they gain a +2 bonus to their throw instead.

###### Class Proficiencies

**Proficiency Progression:** At 1st level, vaultguards select one class proficiency from their class proficiency list and one general proficiency from the general proficiency list. They select an additional class proficiency at 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th level. They select an additional general proficiency at 5th, 9th, and 13th level.

**Dwarven Vaultguard Proficiency List:** Alertness, Berserkergang, Blind Fighting, Caving, Combat Ferocity, Combat Reflexes, Combat Trickery (force back, knock down, overrun, sunder, wrestling), Command, Dungeonbashing Expertise, Dwarven Brewing, Fighting Style Specialization, Goblin-Slaying, Illusion Resistance, Intimidation, Land Surveying, Leadership, Military Strategy, Mountaineering, Precise Shooting, Prospecting, Running, Siege Engineering, Vermin-Slaying, Weapon Focus

### Elven Nightblade

Key Attribute: DEX and INT

Requirements: None

Hit Dice: 1d6

Maximum Level: 11

Elves are lithe, fey beings with pointed ears, delicate features, and graceful movement. They typically weigh about 130 lbs and stand between 5’ 6” and 6’ tall. Humans envy their long lifespans and seeming agelessness. They are a subtle race, and never does their gift for finesse and subtlety so reveal itself as in the practice of death-dealing. Cunning, deadly, and rarely seen, the elven nightblade is an assassin and sorcerer whose art is murder. Most nightblades practice their work in the courts of elven nobility. Those few who venture outside of the forests of Northern Argollë find their skills in high demand, for adventurers, aristocrats, and warlords all value their arcane and deadly ways.

###### Combat Characteristics

Elven nightblades are professional killers, but they prefer to fight by ambush and treachery rather than direct confrontation.

**Combat Proficiencies:**. Elven nightblades have weapon proficiency with all missile weapons and with all tiny, small, and medium melee weapons. They have armor proficiency with light and very light armor. They have fighting style proficiency with the dual weapon and two-handed weapon styles, but not with the weapon and shield style.

**Combat Progression:** Elven nightblades advance in attack throws and saving throws as thieves, by two points every fourlevels of experience. They do not gain any bonus to damage as they advance in level. They can cleave after killing a foe a maximum of once per round per every two class levels (rounded down).

| 11 | 7+ | 8+ | 8+ | 9+ | 9+ | 5+ |

###### Starting Class Powers

At the start of play, nightblades have the following class powers. As with thieves, the nightblade’s skills improve as the nightblade gains levels according to the progression on the Elven Nightblade Skills table.

**Acrobatics:** Nightblades are trained to jump, tumble, somersault, and free-run around obstacles. They gain a +2 bonus to saving throws where agility would help avoid the danger, such as tilting floors and pit traps. They can add their class level to their DEX for purposes of the distance and height they can jump (p. XX). As his movement action, a nightblade can attempt a proficiency throw to tumble past an opponent he has engaged. If the throw fails, the character remains stationary. If it succeeds, he tumbles directly past his enemy into the space on the enemy’s opposite side, ending up either facing towards or away from the opponent (player’s choice). If the space on the enemy’s opposite side is occupied, the nightblade cannot tumble.

If he ends up facing away from the opponent, he can make a combat movement in lieu of attacking if desired. If he ends up facing towards the opponent, he can attack (and possibly backstab) him. The nightblade cannot tumble if he has an encumbrance of more than 5 stone and cannot tumble past the same enemy on two consecutive rounds. (This class power is the equivalent of Acrobatics proficiency.)

**Backstabbing:** Nightblades are skilled at treacherously attacking unprepared enemies. A nightblade can backstab any **vulnerable** opponent. Backstabs can be made in melee or with missile weapons at short range, but cannot be made with missile weapons at medium or longer range. When backstabbing, a nightblade gains a +4 bonus to hit and if the attack succeeds, the nightblade deals an additional die of damage at 1st level, and another additional die at 5th, 9th, and 13th level**.**

**Climbing:** Nightblades are adept at scaling sheer surfaces, including smooth walls or steep cliffs. The nightblade must make a Climbing proficiency throw for each 100’ climbed (with a minimum of one check required). If the throw succeeds, the nightblade can safely ascend or descend the distance. If the throw fails, the nightblade falls a distance equal to half the attempted distance, plus the distance covered by any previous throws, taking 1d6 bludgeoning damage per 10 feet. A nightblade can climb at his exploration speed or one-third his combat speed without penalty. If he moves at one-half combat speed, he takes a -5 penalty to the proficiency throw, and if he moves at full combat speed, he takes a -10 penalty. For further rules on climbing, see p. XX.

**Hiding:** Nightblades are trained to skulk unseen in the cover of darkness. A nightblade can begin hiding as a combat action anytime he is in cover, dim light, or darkness. When the nightblade begins hiding, the Judge must make a Hiding proficiency throw on behalf of the nightblade. A nightblade will always think he is successful in this skill, and will not know otherwise until others react to his presence. Regardless of whether the throw succeeds, opponents encountering the nightblade suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls as long as he remains stationary in cover, dim light, or darkness.

If the throw succeeds, the nightblade is **hidden**. If the throw fails, the nightblade is not hidden. No creature can claim line of sight on a nightblade that is hidden from it. If a hidden nightblade engages an unengaged opponent, the opponent cannot make a free facing change (p. XX). If an opponent knows the hidden nightblade’s general location, the opponent can attack him in melee at a -4 penalty, but it cannot even blindly attack the nightblade if it doesn’t knows his general location. The hidden condition expires at the end of the nightblade’s initiative if he moves or attacks. It also terminates if the cover, dim light, or darkness no longer conceals the nightblade from his opponents.

**Shadowy Senses:** Since the bright light of torches will reveal their positions, nightblades learn to rely on superior night-vision, keen hearing and smell, and echolocation to slowly scout through dark alleys, lightless dungeons, and star-lit rooftops. When moving at combat speed or exploration speed, a nightblade can “see” as if he were carrying a light source that sheds dim light in a 30’ radius. Shadowy senses can be used to fight, probe for traps, and so on. However, shadowy senses cannot be used to discern colors, faces, markings, or flat images (such as frescoes and murals) or to read books, maps, or scrolls. Shadowy senses does not function if the nightblade is charging or running, if deafened, or if in an area of bright light, magical darkness, or magical silence. Because it counts as dim light, an opponent can hide from shadowy senses.

**Sneaking:** Nightblades learn to prowl with great stealth. A nightblade can begin sneaking as a movement action. He can sneak at his encounter speed or one-half combat speed without penalty. If he moves greater than one-half combat speed, he takes a -5 penalty to the Sneaking proficiency throw. If he runs, he takes a -10 penalty.

When the nightblade begins sneaking, the Judge must make a Sneaking proficiency throw on behalf of the nightblade. A nightblade will always think he is successful in this skill, and will not know otherwise until others react to his presence. Regardless of whether the throw succeeds, opponents encountering the nightblade suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls if the nightblade is outside their line of sight.

If the throw succeeds, the nightblade is also **sneaking**. If the throw fails, the nightblade is not sneaking. When sneaking, the nightblade makes no noise when he moves — none whatsoever. Even alert creatures that make a successful Listening proficiency throw will not hear a sound. When a sneaking nightblade engages an unengaged opponent from the rear, the opponent cannot make a free facing change.

**Streetwise:** The nightblade has learned the hard lessons taught by life as a criminal. He might begin play as a member of an assassin’s guild or other criminal syndicate (Judge’s discretion). He can engage in hijinks if he has the necessary proficiencies or thief skills. He can automatically identify gestures, signs, slang, and territory of criminal organizations in his home settlement. He can identify those of other urban settlements with a proficiency throw of 11+. Secret organizations or organizations in far-off cities might be harder to recognize. (This class power is equivalent to one rank of Streetwise proficiency.)

| **Elven Nightblade Skill Progression** | | | | |
| **Level** | **Acrobatics** | **Climbing** | **Hiding** | **Sneaking** |

| 10 | 9+ | -3+ | 6+ | 4+ |
| 11 | 8+ | -4+ | 4+ | 2+ |

###### Additional Class Powers

When they advance in level, nightblades gain the following additional class powers:

**Arcane Magic (2nd level):** As magical assassins, elven nightblades learn and cast arcane spells. However, they are not as devoted to the arcane arts as mages, so their caster level and progression are at a slower rate. The nightblade’s caster level, and the number and levels of spells the nightblade can cast in a single day, are listed on the Nightblade Spell Progression table. Like a mage, a nightblade’s spell selection is limited to the spells in his **repertoire**. A nightblade’s repertoire can include up to the number and level of spells listed for his level, increased by his Intellect bonus. Unlike (human) mages, an elven nightblade can cast spells while wearing light or very light armor.

**Quiet Magic (2nd level):** Nightblades can cast their spells with minimal words and gestures. A successful proficiency throw to hear noise is required to hear the nightblade cast spells. Full binding and gagging is necessary to prevent the nightblade from working magic. (This class power is the equivalent of Quiet Magic proficiency.)

**Minor Magical Research (7th level):** The elven nightblade can research spells, scribe magical scrolls, and brew potions as if he were a 5th level mage.

**Hideout (9th level):** By acquiring a **hideout** worth at least 5,000gp, the elven nightblade can attract followers to his service. 2d6 1st level elven nightblades will arrive to serve him as followers within 1d4 weeks of him acquiring the hideout. If the nightblade already has a hideout, the followers arrive to serve him within 1d4 weeks of him reaching 9th level. If hired, the followers must be paid standard rates for henchmen. These followers will serve the character with some loyalty, though at least one will be an infiltrator working for the nightblade’s local rivals, sent to keep an eye on the character. A cunning and resourceful nightblade can use these followers to start a criminal syndicate. Additional rules for hideouts and syndicates are detailed in the **Campaigns** chapter.

###### Racial Traits

As elves, nightblades have certain powers and drawbacks associated with their race.

**Attunement to Nature:** Elves gain a +1 bonus to surprise rolls when in the wilderness. When using the Adventuring proficiency to search or listen, they succeed on a proficiency throw of 14+ (instead of the usual 18+). If separately proficient in Searching they gain a +2 bonus to their throw instead. If separately proficient in Listening, they gain a +4 bonus to their throw instead.

**Connection to Nature:** Because of their connection to nature, elves are completely unaffected by diseases caused by undead, and gain a +1 bonus to Paralysis and Spells saving throws. Their robust vitality grants a +1 bonus to their HD roll at 1st level. (These adjustments are already factored into their HD and saving throws on the tables.)

**Elf Tongues:** Elves can speak the Common, Elven, Gnoll, Hobgoblin, and Orc languages.

###### Class Proficiencies

**Proficiency Progression:** At 1st level, nightblades select one class proficiency from their class proficiency list and one general proficiency from the general proficiency list. They select an additional class proficiency at 4th and 8th level. They select an additional general proficiency at 5th and 9th level.

**Elven Nightblade Proficiency List:** Battle Magic, Beast Friendship, Black Lore of Zahar, Blind Fighting, Combat Reflexes, Contortionism, Counterspelling, Eavesdropping, Elementalism, Expanded Repertoire, Familiar, Fighting Style Specialization, Kin-Slaying, Magical Engineering, Mastery of Enchantments & Illusions, Mystic Aura, Passing Without Trace, Poisoning, Precise Shooting, Prestidigitation, Running, Sensing Power, Skirmishing, Skulking, Sniping, Swashbuckling, Unflappable Casting, Unarmed Fighting, Wakefulness, Weapon Focus, Weapon Finesse

### Elven Spellsword

Key Attribute: STR and INT

Requirements: None

Hit Dice: 1d6

Maximum Level: 10

Elves are lithe, fey beings with pointed ears, delicate features, and graceful movement. They typically weigh about 130 lbs and stand between 5’ 6” and 6’ tall. Humans envy their long lifespans and seeming agelessness. Though elves are a peaceful people that enjoy poetry and art, they are also very talented fighters and skilled mages. Within the Auran Empire, most elves dwell in the isolated forests of Northern Argollë; those that traffic in the kingdoms of man are both bold and remarkable. The elven spellsword class represents one such remarkable elf, trained in the arts of both fighters and mages.

###### Combat Characteristics

Elven spellswords learn an elegant, deadly style of fighting that enables them to cast arcane spells while fully armored.

**Combat Proficiencies:** Elven spellswords have weapon proficiency with all weapons, armor proficiency with all armor, and fighting style proficiency with all three optional styles (i.e. the dual weapon, two-handed weapon, and weaponand shield styles).

**Combat Progression:** Elven spellswords advance in attack throws and saving throws as fighters, by two points every three levels of experience. They increase their base damage roll from successful missile and melee attacks by +1 at 1st level, and by an additional +1 at 3rd, 6th, and 9th level. They can cleave after killing a foe a maximum of once per round per class level.

###### Starting Class Powers

At the start of play, elven spellswords have the following class powers.

**Arcane Magic:** Elven spellswords can learn and cast powerful arcane spells. The number and levels of spells the spellsword can cast in a single day are listed on the Elven Spellsword Spell Progression table. A spellsword’s spell selection is limited to the spells in his **repertoire**. A spellsword’s repertoire can include a number of spells up to the number and level of spells listed for his level, increased by his Intellect bonus. Unlike (human) mages, elven spellswords can also cast spells while wearing armor. More information on casting spells and individual spell descriptions can be found in the **Spells** chapter.

**Collegiate Wizardry**: The spellsword has received arcane instruction as an apprentice to a spellsword, pupil at a magical academy, or member of an arcane organization. He can begin play as a member of a wizard’s guild or similar order (Judge’s discretion). He can automatically identify arcane symbols, spell signatures, trappings, and grimoires of his own order or tradition, and can recognize those of other orders or traditions with a proficiency throw of 11+. Rare or esoteric traditions might be harder to recognize. (This class power is the equivalent of one rank of Collegiate Wizardry proficiency.)

###### Additional Class Powers

When they advance in level, spellswords gain the following additional class powers:

**Minor Magical Research (5th level):** The elven spellsword can research spells, scribe magical scrolls, and brew potions.

**Major Magical Research (9th level):** The elven spellsword can create more powerful magic items such as weapons, rings, and staffs.

**Fastness (9th level):** By acquiring a **fastness** worth at least 15,000gp in a natural setting such as a forest or glen, the elven spellsword can attract elves to his service. 3d6 x 10 1st level elven mercenaries arrive to serve him as followers within 1d3 months of him acquiring the fastness. If the spellsword has already acquired a fastness, the followers arrive to serve him within 1d3 months of him reaching 9th level. The spellsword must pay his followers the ordinary rates for mercenaries and henchmen or they leave his service. Additional rules for elven fastnesses are detailed in the **Campaigns** chapter (p. XX).

###### Racial Traits

As elves, spellswords have certain powers and drawbacks associated with their race.

**Attunement to Nature:** Elves gain a +1 bonus to surprise rolls when in the wilderness. When using the Adventuring proficiency, to search or listen, they succeed on a proficiency throw of 14+ (instead of the usual 18+). If separately proficient in Searching they gain a +2 bonus to their throw instead. If separately proficient in Listening, they gain a +4 bonus to their throw instead.

**Connection to Nature:** Because of their **connection to nature**, elves are completely unaffected by diseases caused by undead, and gain a +1 bonus to Paralysis and Spells saving throws. Their robust vitality grants a +1 bonus to their HD roll at 1st level. (These adjustments are already factored into their HD and saving throws on the tables.)

**Elf Tongues:** Elves can speak the Common, Elven, Gnoll, Hobgoblin, and Orc languages.

The winged knight’s eagle familiar grants him Command proficiency. The eagle feather wings on the winged knight’s banded plate armor are purely decorative. They do not actually grant the character the power to fly.

### Nobiran Wonderworker

Key Attribute: INT and WIL

Requirements: STR 11, INT 11, WIL 11, DEX 11, CON 11, CHA 11

Hit Dice: 1d4

Maximum Level: 12

The ancient Nobir were the heroes of the Empyrean War, kings and prophets granted epic power by the gods. Though these bloodlines have faded with the passing of time, occasionally a scion is still born with great gifts. The Nobiran Wonderworker is such a being, blessed with mastery of both arcane and divine magic. Nobiran Wonderworkers are exceedingly rare. In the Auran Empire, only two Wonderworkers are known: The great Artashumara of Shemal-Uliltu and the mighty Abia, called Indura’s Wrath. Doubtless in the troubled times ahead, the gods will see fit to bless others with such power.

###### Combat Characteristics

Wonderworkers see little need for combat training. Like mages and priestesses, they should avoid combat.

**Combat Proficiencies:** Wonderworkers have weapon proficiency with clubs, daggers, darts, and staffs. They have no armor proficiency. They have fighting style proficiency with the two-handed weapon style (allowing them to use a staff with both hands), but not with the dual weapon or weaponand shield styles.

**Combat Progression:** Wonderworkers advance in attack throws and saving throws only two points every six levels of experience (i.e., the same as mages). They cannot cleave, regardless of class level.

| 10 – 12 | 8+ | 8+ | 10+ | 6+ | 7+ | 7+ |

###### Starting Class Powers

At the start of play, Nobiran wonderworkers have the following class powers.

**Arcane Magic:** Nobiran wonderworkers learn and cast arcane spells as mages. The number and levels of spells the wonderworker can use in a single day is summarized on the Nobiran Wonderworker Arcane Spell Progression table. Like a mage, the wonderworker’s spell selection is limited to the spells in his **repertoire**. A wonderworker’s repertoire can include a number of spells up to the number and level of spells listed for his level, increased by his Intellect bonus.

**Collegiate Wizardry**: The wonderworker has received arcane instruction as an apprentice to a mage, pupil at a magical academy, or member of an arcane organization. He can begin play as a member of a wizard’s guild or similar order (Judge’s discretion). He can automatically identify arcane symbols, spell signatures, trappings, and grimoires of his own order or tradition, and can recognize those of other orders or traditions with a proficiency throw of 11+. Rare or esoteric traditions might be harder to recognize. (This class power is the equivalent of one rank of Collegiate Wizardry proficiency.)

**Divine Magic:** Wonderworkers can manifest their deity’s power in the form of divine spells, which are granted through prayer and worship. The power and number of divine spells available to the character are determined by level according to the Nobiran Wonderworker Divine Spell Progression table. Wonderworkers have the same **repertoire** of spells available as crusaders of their faith, unless the Judge determines otherwise.

**Divine Health:** Wonderworkers have sanctified bodies that render them immune to all forms of disease, including magical diseases caused by spells, mummies, or lycanthropes.

**Lay on Hands:** So abundant is the wonderworker’s life force that he can lay on hands to heal injuries. He can heal 2 damage per class level when the power is used. He can use his power to lay on hands once per day. The wonderworker can select the Laying on Hands proficiency to gain additional uses of the power per day. (This class power is the equivalent of one rank of the Laying on Hands proficiency.)

###### Additional Class Powers

When they advance in level, Nobiran wonderworkers gain the following additional class powers:

**Minor Magical Research (5th level):** The wonderworker can scribe magical scrolls, brew potions, and research arcane spells.

**Major Magical Research (9th level):** The wonderworker can create more powerful magic items such as weapons, rings, and staffs.

**Sanctum (9th level):** By acquiring a **sanctum** (often a great tower) worth at least 15,000gp, the wonderworker can attract followers to his service. 1d6 apprentice wonderworkers of 1st – 3rd level plus 2d6 apprentices of 0th level arrive to serve him as followers within 1d3 months of him acquiring the sanctum. If the wonderworker already has a sanctum, the followers arrive to serve him within 1d3 months of him reaching 9th level. The apprentices function as assistants in magical research (see p. XXX). If performing magic research, the apprentices must be provided food and lodging, but need not be paid wages. (If asked to accompany the wonderworker on an adventure, the apprentices must be paid wages as henchmen.) If the wonderworker builds a **dungeon** beneath or near his sanctum, monsters will start to arrive to dwell within, often followed by adventurers seeking to fight them. Additional rules for wonderworker’ **sanctums** are detailed in the **Campaigns** chapter (p. XX).

**Supreme Magical Research (11th level):** The wonderworker can learn and cast ritual arcane spells of great power (7th, 8th, and 9th level), craft magical constructs, and create magical crossbreeds. If chaotic, the wonderworker can create necromantic servants and become undead. Rules for magic research can be found in the **Campaigns** chapter (p. XX).

###### Racial Traits

**Blood of Ancient Kings:** Every Nobiran has the royal presence of the demi-gods and heroes of old. The character can hire one more henchman than his Charisma would otherwise permit, and the base loyalty score of any henchmen is increased by 1.

**Favor of the Empyrean Powers:** The powers of Law protect their champions from harm. Wonderworkers receive a +2 bonus to all saving throws. (This adjustment is already factored into the saving throws on the Nobiran Wonderworker Attack and Saving Throws table above.)

**Longeval:** Wonderworkers are seemingly ageless, suffering no penalties from advancing age. They enjoy a lifespan three times longer than that of normal men. Their robust vitality grants them a +1 bonus to their HD roll at 1st level. Like elves, they are immune to the diseases caused by undead.

###### Code of Behavior

In order to use divine magic, maintain his divine blessing, and lay on hands, a wonderworker must uphold the sacred laws of good and order. Wonderworkers must obey the strictures below, or other strictures determined by the Judge for his campaign.

* The wonderworker must always display his holy symbol somewhere on his person when in public.
* The wonderworker must offer prayers to his deity at dawn and dusk. Offering prayers requires one turn (10 minutes).
* The wonderworker must use his gifts in the struggle against Chaos and uphold Law.
* The wonderworker must not use his divine magic for unlawful or Chaotic purposes.

If a wonderworker ever falls from favor, due to violating the strictures of his faith, the gods might impose penalties upon the wonderworker. As with crusaders, these penalties are entirely up to the Judge.

###### Class Proficiencies

**Proficiency Progression:** At 1st level, wonderworkers select one class proficiency from their class proficiency list and one general proficiency from the general proficiency list. They select an additional class proficiency at 6th and 12th level. They select an additional general proficiency at 5th and 9th level.

**Nobiran Wonderworker Proficiency List:** Alchemy, Battle Magic, Beast Friendship, Black Lore of Zahar, Bright Lore of Aura, Command, Contemplation, Counterspelling, Elementalism, Expanded Repertoire, Experimenting, Familiar, Healing, Illusion Resistance, Laying on Hands, Loremastery, Magical Engineering, Martial Training, Mastery of Conjuration & Summoning, Mastery of Enchantments & Illusions, Mystic Aura, Prestidigitation, Prophecy, Quiet Magic, Sensing Evil, Sensing Power, Soothsaying, Syncretism, Transmogrification, Unflappable Casting

**Notes:** Most characters of this class have above average intelligence, and the templates above reflect that. Each template assumes that the character has an INT attribute of between 13 and 15, qualifying him for one bonus proficiency and one bonus spell. The bonus proficiency and bonus spell that each template begins with are noted last. For characters with INT of less than 13 or greater than 15, see the **Intellect Scores of Studious Spellcasters** section in this chapter.

Saqqara is another name for Iskara, goddess of chaos. Teos is another name for Istreus, god of secrets. Indura is another name for Ianna, goddess of love and war. For the Servant of Fire template, there are three alternative spell selections available, one for each element. See Mage Templates (p. XX). For the Corrupted Soul template, the Code of Behavior is reversed to favor chaos over law.

### Zaharan Ruinguard

Key Attribute: STR and INT

Requirements: INT 9, WIL 9, CHA 9

Hit Dice: 1d6

Maximum Level: 12

In the waning days of the decadent Zaharan empire, as its graceful cities burned to ash and the races of man, elf, and dwarf slaughtered the children of Zahar without mercy for their arrogance and tyranny, an order of militant sorcerer-knights known as ruinguards was ordained by Sebek, last of the sorcerer-kings. The ruinguards were charged with safeguarding the powerful secrets of the chthonic gods and laying down their lives to prevent the voice of Chaos from passing into oblivion.

The hobbled eunuch-seers and iron-bound tomes of the great Zaharan libraries were too burdensome to carry away and hide from the wrathful judgment of Law as it descended upon crumbling Zahar. The ruinguards mastered arcane bindings to focus the dark chthonic secrets of a dying empire within a receptacle they knew they would always have at hand — their very weapons. The Zaharan empire vanished over a millennium ago, but the masters of this tenebrous order have not only carried the knowledge of Chaos with them, but learned to call upon that knowledge to enhance their own martial and magical skill and bring doom to their enemies.

Each ruinguard is a master of his own fate; an individual conduit to the knowledge of Chaos and the chthonic powers spread across the void. Whether they carry such power within them and focus it upon the weapon they wield, or whether the weapon itself holds the chthonic power and they merely call it forth to do battle, even the ruinguard does not truly know. Ruinguards typically adventure to accumulate power, skill, and allies in order to dominate more and more around them — some even harbor dreams of rebuilding an empire. Others resist succumbing completely to the Chaos that constantly seeks to consume them. This rarer breed of ruinguard seeks adventure to quell the wanderlust within themselves and find camaraderie and kinship amongst those adventurers who also choose to wander dark roads and distant lands.

###### Combat Characteristics

Ruinguards are brutal combatants who rarely show mercy. The chthonic powers a ruinguard channels revel in the chaos and brutality of face-to-face combat. They favor the heaviest armor available so they can wade into close quarters and frown upon weapons which draw blood from a distance.

**Combat Proficiencies:** Ruinguards have weapon proficiency with battle axes, great axes, flails, swords, two-handed swords, and whips. They have armor proficiency with all armors. They have fighting style proficiency with the weapon and shield and two-handed weapon styles, but not with the dual weapon style.

**Combat Progression:** Ruinguards advance in attack throws and saving throws as fighters, by two points every three levels of experience. They increase their base damage roll from successful melee attacks using these weapons by +1 at 1st level, and by an additional +1 at 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th level. They can cleave after killing a foe a maximum of once per round per class level.

###### Starting Class Powers:

In addition to their fighting ability, a Zaharan ruinguard’s eager embrace of chthonic secrets provides him with several benefits. At the start of play, ruinguards have the following class powers.

**Dark Blessing:** Zaharan ruinguards enjoy the blessing of the chthonic gods. They gain a +2 bonus to all saving throws. (These adjustments are already factored into the saving throws on the Zaharan Ruinguard Attack and Saving Throws table.)

**Manual of Arms:** The ruinguard is highly experienced in military discipline, physical fitness, and weapon drill. He can automatically identify the battle standards, equipment, great captains, military slang, and rank insignia of his homeland. He can identify those of other realms with a proficiency throw of 11+. He can fight as a regular (rather than irregular) troop in formed and loose units. He can begin play as a member of a legion, mercenary’s guild, or other military organization (Judge’s discretion). (This class power is equivalent to one rank of Manual of Arms proficiency.)

**Preternatural Quickening:** Zaharan ruinguards act with supernatural celerity. A ruinguard gains a +1 bonus to initiative and a +1 bonus to avoid surprise.

**Weapon Focus:** Ruinguards are experts with their weapon of choice. The Zaharan ruinguard gains the Weapon Focus proficiency with his choice of one specific weapon type (axes; maces, flails and hammers; swords and daggers).

###### Additional Class Powers

As a Zaharan ruinguard gains experience, he learns how to tap arcane energy to cast spells and enhance his prowess in battle. They gain the following additional class powers:

**Arcane Magic (2nd level):** As sorcerers as well as warriors, Zaharan ruinguards learn and cast arcane spells. However, they are not as devoted to the arcane arts as mages, so their caster level and progression are at a slower rate. The ruinguard’s caster level, and the number and levels of spells the ruinguard can cast in a single day, are listed on the Ruinguard Spell Progression table. Like a mage, a ruinguard’s spell selection is limited to the spells in his **repertoire**. A ruinguard’s repertoire can include the number of spells up to the number and level of spells listed for his level, increased by his Intellect bonus. Unlike (human) mages, a Zaharan ruinguard can cast spells while wearing any type of armor.

**Arcane Striking (2nd level):** The Zaharan ruinguard learns to channel arcane energy through his melee weapons. Whenever the ruinguard successfully hits a target with a melee attack, he can immediately expend one of his daily spell slots to increase damage. Damage is increased by 1d6 per level of the spell slot expended. Damage dealt by arcane striking counts as extraordinary arcane damage. If the target is slain by his arcane strike, the ruinguard is eligible to cleave as if he had slain the target in melee.

EXAMPLE: Moruvai needs to make an attack throw of 14+ to strike the great dragon Orm. Finally, he does so! He immediately expends a 1st level spell slot to do an extra 1d6 damage on his hit.

**Death Healing (4th level):** The Zaharan ruinguard learns to drain the life force of fallen foes in order to heal himself. Whenever the ruinguard successfully slays a sentient creature with a melee attack, he can expend a spell slot to heal himself. Healing is 1d6 per level of the spell slot expended, to a maximum value equal to the slain victim’s maximum (starting) hit points. The ruinguard can cleave after death healing if he has any cleaves remaining. A ruinguard with sufficient spell slots can combine death healing and arcane striking.

EXAMPLE: Moruvai slays a hobgoblin (hp 7). He sacrifices a 2nd level spell and heals himself 2d6 hit points. The 2d6 roll is an 8; Moruvai heals 7 hp because he cannot heal more than the slain victim’s hit points.

**Dark Charisma (5th level):** The ruinguard’s sinister presence begins to inspire the forces of evil to follow him. Any Chaotic characters or monsters in the ruinguard’s service gain a +1 bonus to their morale score whenever he personally leads them. The bonus stacks with any modifiers from the ruinguard’s Charisma or proficiencies.

**Minor Magical Research (7th level):** The Zaharan ruinguard can research spells, scribe magical scrolls, and brew potions as if he were a 5th level mage.

**Dark Fortress (9th level):** By acquiring a **dark fortress** worth at least 15,000gp, the Zaharan ruinguard can attract followers to his service. 5d6 x 10 0th level or beastman troops and 1d6 Zaharan ruinguards of 1st – 3rd level arrive to serve him within 1d3 months of him acquiring the fortress. If the ruinguard already has a fortress, the followers arrive to serve him within 1d3 months of him reaching 9th level. The ruinguard must pay his followers the ordinary rates for mercenaries and henchmen or they leave his service. Should he prove a powerful, ruthless leader, the ruinguard’s power may spread like a dark blight across the realm as those drawn to dark power flock to his banner. Additional rules for dark fortresses are detailed in the **Campaigns** chapter (p. XX).

**Spell Storing (9th level):** The ruinguard learns to channel his spells into his weapon. Whenever a ruinguard casts a spell that would normally target a creature, he can instead cast it into his melee weapon, where it remains stored until discharged. The effect will discharge onto the next creature the ruinguard strikes with the weapon, resulting in both melee damage and the normal effects of the spell. The ruinguard can only store one spell at a time, and the spell will discharge harmlessly if not used in 1 turn (10 minutes),if the weapon is sundered, or if the ruinguard loses his grip on the weapon. A ruinguard with sufficient spell slots can combine spell storing, death healing, and/or arcane striking. A character being killed by a stored spell does not allow the ruinguard to cleave.

EXAMPLE: Moruvai casts *dismember*into his two-handed sword, spell storing it. He then attacks a minotaur, and hits, dealing his normal melee damage. Upon hitting, Moruvai uses his arcane striking power, expending a 2nd level spell slot to deal an additional 2d6 damage. *Dismember*also discharges, and the minotaur fails its save, taking an additional 3d6 damage and a permanent wound from the spell. The cumulative damage slays the minotaur. Moruvai then expends a 3rd level spell slot and death heals himself 3d6 damage. Because the damage from *dismember* was needed to kill the minotaur, Moruvai cannot cleave.

**Major Magical Research (12th level)**: The Zaharan ruinguard can an create more powerful magic items such as weapons, rings, and staffs, as if he were a 9th level mage.

###### Racial Traits

As true Zaharans, all ruinguards also possess certain inhuman benefits and drawbacks from their near-extinct bloodline.

**After the Flesh:** For most mortals, undeath is a curse. For Zaharans, it is a pathway to power. If transformed into intelligent undead, the Zaharan ruinguard retains his racial powers and his class abilities. Once transformed, the ruinguard can continue to advance in Hit Dice without limit, even past his class’s maximum level. A 1 HD undead ruinguard requires 4,000 XP to advance to 2 HD plus an additional 500 XP per \* the undead possesses. The amount of XP required to advance as an undead doubles with each HD thereafter (round values greater than 20,000 XP to the nearest 1,000). All of the ruinguard’s class abilities will continue to progress without regard to his class’s maximum level, to a maximum of 14th level. The ***ACKS II Judges Journal***offers additional rules for characters advancing via this power (p. XX).

**Ancient Pacts:** The lords of Zahar ensorcelled the dark powers of the world with ancient pactsof service and obedience. Some creatures still remember these pacts and will aid Zaharans when commanded. All ruinguards gain a +1 bonus to reaction rolls when encountering intelligent Chaotic monsters. Intelligent Chaotic monsters suffer a -2 penalty to saving throws against any enchantment spells cast by a Zaharan ruinguard.

**Dark Souls:** Because of their black spirits, the grim embrace of death holds special perils for Zaharans. Whenever a deceased Zaharan rolls on the Tampering With Mortality table, he suffers a penalty on the 1d20 roll of -1 per level of experience.

**Inexorable:** Ruinguards are inexorable in the face of horrors that terrify normal men. They are immune to all natural and magical **fear** effects.

**Zaharan Tongues:** Due to their background and training, all Zaharan ruinguards can speak Ancient Zaharan, Common, Goblin, Orc, and Kemeshi.

###### Class Proficiencies

**Proficiency Progression:** At 1st level, ruinguards select one class proficiency from their class proficiency list and one general proficiency from the general proficiency list. They select an additional class proficiency at 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th level. They select an additional general proficiency at 5th and 9th level.

**Zaharan Ruinguard Proficiency List**: Alertness, Ambushing, Battle Magic, Berserkergang, Black Lore of Zahar, Blind Fighting, Combat Ferocity, Combat Trickery (force back, knock down, overrun, sunder), Command, Dungeonbashing Expertise, Elementalism, Familiar, Fighting Style Specialization, Kin-Slaying, Leadership, Martial Training, Mastery of Conjuration & Summoning, Military Strategy, Mounted Combat, Mystic Aura, Sensing Good, Sensing Power, Skirmishing, Unflappable Casting, Wakefulness

# Chapter 3: Proficiencies

## The Basics of Proficiencies

Proficiencies represent particular areas of expertise that your character has developed due to his background, homeland, and training. Each class has a **class** **list** of proficiencies, representing training that is particularly useful to the particular profession. In addition, there is a **general list** of proficiencies, which represent trade skills and knowledge that is widely available to all. Characters will learn proficiencies from both lists over time.

## Starting Proficiencies

All characters begin with the Adventuring proficiency as well as one proficiency chosen from their class list and one proficiency chosen from the general list. Characters with an Intellect bonus may choose to begin the game knowing one or more additional proficiencies from the general list. The number of additional general proficiencies that may be learned is equal to their Intellect bonus (+1, +2, or +3). The player can choose to leave one or more bonus proficiency “slots” open, to be filled during play as circumstances suggest appropriate choices. However, bonus proficiencies from high Intellect can onlybe used to select proficiencies from the general list.

Note that some proficiencies appear on both the general list and the class lists. For example, Military Strategy appears on both the general list and the fighter class list. This is because Military Strategy is both a common trade skill (general list) and specialized training that is useful to fighters (class list).

## Gaining Proficiencies

All characters may choose one additional proficiency from the general list at levels 5, 9, and (if maximum level permits) 13. Characters may choose one additional proficiency from their class list each time they complete a full (two point) saving throw progression. This is summarized on the Proficiencies Gained per Level table. Levels exceeding a class’s maximum level are marked with a “-“.

Unless its description says otherwise, a proficiency may only be selected once. If a general proficiency can be selected more than once, then the target value required for success is reduced by 4 each time the proficiency is selected. Some proficiencies may offer additional benefits if taken multiple times. Unless otherwise noted, all proficiency throws use 1d20.

The Judge may impose limitations on the selection of certain proficiencies depending on his campaign or setting. Otherwise, characters may take any proficiency on the appropriate list.

###### Gaining Proficiencies by Time and Training (Optional)

In addition to their starting and level-based proficiencies, all characters have four “implicit” general proficiency slots which represent their potential for natural accretion of knowledge over time. Characters who are not exceptionally diligent at practice automatically fill these slots after 5, 15, 35, and 70 years of work. This is how 0th level NPCs gain proficiencies without adventuring. In normal circumstances of play, these proficiencies are irrelevant to adventurers.

As an optional rule, however, the Judge can permit adventurers to accelerate their acquisition of these proficiency slots by deliberately training:

* 60 days (2 months) of dedicated activity of training grants the first rank of one general proficiency.
* 240 days (8 months) of dedicated activity of training grants the second rank or the first rank of a second proficiency.
* 540 days (18 months) of dedicated activity of training grants the third rank or the first rank of a third proficiency.
* 960 days (32 months) of dedicated activity to training grants the fourth rank or the first rank of a fourth proficiency.

The adventurer must have access to either a tutor who knows the proficiency or to a treatise equal to the rank he is training. No more than four general proficiencies can be acquired from training.

###### Retraining Proficiencies (Optional)

Sometimes a character may choose a proficiency that was useful at a certain stage in his career, but which is no longer necessary as he advances in power. As an optional rule, the Judge can permit adventurers to retrain an existing class or general proficiency for another proficiency of the same type. Retraining a proficiency requires 120 days of downtime, during which time the character must have access to either a tutor who knows the proficiency or to a treatise. A character can re-retrain back into a proficiency he previously knew with 60 days of downtime without need for a tutor or manual. The following proficiencies cannot be retrained: Beast Friendship, Divine Blessing, Divine Health, Elven Bloodline, Illusion Resistance, Laying on Hands, Prophecy, Soothsaying.

###### Proficiencies of Normal Humans and Demi-Humans

Normal humans and demi-humans (non-adventuring 0th level characters) begin their careers with four general proficiencies. (In rare cases, 0th level characters might have class proficiencies.) If their Intellect is 13 or greater, they gain additional general proficiencies equal to their Intellect bonus. A character cannot select the same proficiency more than once with his four starting proficiencies, but can use bonus proficiencies from high INT to do so.

As discussed under Gaining Proficiencies by Time, 0th level NPCs get additional proficiencies with time. Normal humans gain an additional general proficiency after 5 years, 15 years, and 35 years of work. Normal dwarves and elves gain an additional general proficiency after 5, 15, 35, and 70 years of work. Some exceptional 0th level NPCs might train in their downtime to acquire additional general proficiencies faster than 5 – 35 years, as adventurers do (Judge’s discretion).

EXAMPLE: Tavus is a highly intelligent (INT 16) 0th level young man. He begins his career at age 18 with six general proficiencies — four base + two more from his high INT. He selects Craft (Carpenter), Engineering, Labor (Stonecutting), and Mapping with his four starting proficiencies. With his bonus proficiencies he takes two additional ranks in Engineering. At age 23, he gains an additional proficiency, which he uses to take a fourth rank in Engineering. He is now qualified to serve as an Engineer specialist (see **Specialists** in Chapter 4), making him among the youngest engineers in his guild. A character of average Intellect might take a lifetime to gain that same level of proficiency.

## Proficiency Descriptions

For ease of reference, proficiencies that appear on the general list are marked with (G). Other proficiencies appear only on one or more class lists.

###### Adventuring (G)

The character is well-equipped for a life of adventure. He knows how to clean and sharpen weapons, set up a camp, cook meals over open flame, saddle and ride a horse outside of combat, and perform rough-and-ready first aid. He has a rough idea of the value of common coins, trade goods, gems, and jewelry, and of the nature of different types of magic and monsters. The character can also:

* Bash down stuck doors as a combat action by succeeding on a Dungeonbashing proficiency throw of 18+;
* Climb easy-to-scale obstacles such as ropes or branchy trees by succeeding on a Climbing proficiency throw of 8+;
* Methodically search for concealed traps, secret doors, buried treasure, and other hidden features by spending one turn (10 minutes) and succeeding on a Searching proficiency throw of 18+;
* Methodically disarm traps by spending one turn (10 minutes) and succeeding on a Trapbreaking proficiency throw of 18+;
* Pause and listen for noises by spending one round and succeeding on a Listening proficiency throw of 18+.

For detailed information on these activities, see the Thief class powers (p. XX) and Chapter 6: **Adventures** (p. XX). All player characters are assumed to have Adventuring. Most classed NPCs also have Adventuring, but most 0th level NPCs do not. Adventuring counts as a class proficiency if selected after the start of play.

###### Acrobatics

The character is trained to jump, tumble, somersault, and free-run around obstacles. He gains a +2 to saving throws where agility would help avoid the danger, such as tilting floors and pit traps. He can add his class level to his DEX for purposes of the distance and height he can jump. He can add his class level to Paralysis saving throws to avoid falling down.

As a movement action, he can attempt a proficiency throw to tumble past an opponent he has engaged. At 1st level the character must make a proficiency throw of 18+ to succeed. The proficiency throw required reduces by 1 per level. If the throw fails, the character remains stationary. If it succeeds, he tumbles directly past his enemy into the space on the enemy’s opposite side, ending up either facing towards or away from the opponent (player’s choice). If the space on the enemy’s opposite side is occupied, the character cannot tumble. If the opposite space If he ends up facing away from the opponent, he can make a combat movement in lieu of attacking if desired. If he ends up facing towards the opponent, he can attack (and possibly backstab) him. A character cannot tumble if he has an encumbrance of 5 stone or more. A character cannot tumble past the same enemy on two consecutive rounds.

Alchemy (G)

The character has been trained in the art of brewing and identifying alchemical substances such as potions, poisons, and oils. It is of great utility to adventurers.

With one rank of Alchemy, the character can identify common alchemical substances by aroma and color in one round with a proficiency throw of 11+. He can attempt to identify which parts of a monster are special components with a proficiency throw of 14+. He can also attempt to extract toxin from poisonous plants. Each attempt requires one day of dedicated activity and a proficiency throw of 20+ for fresh plants and 24+ for dried plants. If the throw succeeds, the character extracts one dose of poison. If the throw fails, the character accidentally spoils the plants. If the throw fails on an unmodified 1, the character has accidentally exposed himself to the toxin and must immediately make a successful Death saving throw or suffer its effects. In addition, he counts as a 1st level mage for purposes of brewing potions, or gains a +1 bonus to alchemy-related magic research throws if already of higher caster level. He gains a research rate of 5gp for alchemy or increases his existing research rate by 5%.

With two ranks of Alchemy, the character can automatically extract special components from oozes, incarnations, and incorporeal undead identify substances with a throw of 7+, identify special components on 11+, and extract toxins on 16+/20+. He counts as a 3rd level mage for purposes of brewing potions or gains a +2 bonus to alchemy-related magic research throws if already of higher caster level. He gains a research rate of 15gp for alchemy or increases his existing research rate by 10%.

With three ranks of Alchemy, the character can identify substances with a throw of 3+, identify special components on 7+, and extract toxins on 12+/16+. He counts as a 5th level mage for purposes of brewing potions or gains a +3 bonus to alchemy-related magic research throws if that would grant higher caster level. He can supervise other casters or alchemists brewing potions. He gains a research rate of 50gp for alchemy or increases his existing research rate by 15%, whichever is greater. He could work as an alchemist (as described in **Specialists,** p. XX).

###### Alertness

The character is alert to danger.He gains a +1 bonus to avoid surprise. When using Adventuring proficiency to search or listen, he succeeds on a proficiency throw of 14+ (instead of the usual 18+). If separately proficient in Searching or Listening, he gains a +2 bonus to his throw instead.

###### Ambushing

The character is skilled at attacking unprepared enemies. He can ambush any **vulnerable** opponent. Ambushes can be made in melee or with missile weapons at short range, but cannot be made with missile weapons at medium or longer range. When ambushing, the character gets a +4 bonus on his attack throws and deals an extra die of damage on the attack.

###### Animal Husbandry (G)

The character is skilled at caring for animals. As a dedicated activity, a character can care for three animals, plus an additional one each time Animal Husbandry is selected. A wounded animal under the character’s care automatically regains an extra 1d3 hit points per day of rest if provided with sanitary conditions and proper feed. If an animal under his care is sick or poisoned, the character can attempt to diagnose the disease or poison. Diagnosis requires one turn (10 minutes) of medical examination and a proficiency throw of 11+. If the throw succeeds, the character identifies whether the disease or poison is magical or mundane, and if mundane, diagnoses it. If the throw fails, he does not identify or diagnose the disease or poison. He cannot try again until the animal develops further symptoms.

If the character selects Animal Husbandrytwice, he is a veterinarian. He can now diagnose illness on 7+. He can also attempt to non-magically *neutralize poison*,*cure**disease*,or *cure**light**injury* on a poisoned, sick, or wounded animal. He must have successfully diagnosed a disease or poison before attempting to cure it. Each attempt requires one turn (10 minutes) and a proficiency throw of 18+. If the throw succeeds, the healing effect occurs as if the spell had been cast. If the throw fails, he cannot try again with that effect on that animal until the following day. If the character selects Animal Husbandrythree times, he is a veterinary surgeon. He can now diagnose illness on 3+. He can *neutralize**poison*,*cure**disease*,or *cure**serious**injury*on a poisoned, sick, or wounded animal with a proficiency throw of 14+.

The ability to care for animals provides the character with a number of other useful abilities. With one rank of Animal Husbandry, the character can harvest components from animals. With two ranks, he can harvest components from vermin. With a combined two ranks of Animal Husbandry and/or Healing, he can harvest components from beastmen, and with a combined three ranks, from monstrosities.

The character can also attempt to extract venom from slain animals. Each attempt requires one hour of ancillary activity and a proficiency throw of 18+. If the throw succeeds, the character extracts one dose of poison. If the throw fails, the character can try again. If the throw fails on an unmodified 1, the character accidentally exposes himself to fang or stinger, and must immediately make a Death saving throw. On a failure, he suffers the venom’s effects.

Because most creatures share many anatomical traits, a character with this proficiency can use it on humanoids, monstrosities, and vermin at a -4 penalty.

| Veterinary Surgeon | 3 | 100gp | 5 | Identify 3+, *neutralize* *poison*, *cure* *disease*, *cure* *serious* 14+ |

###### Animal Training (G)

The character knows how to breed, groom, and train animals of various sorts. With one rank of Animal Training, the character can train domestic animals such as dogs, falcons, and horses. With two ranks, he can train wild animals such as bears and lions. With three ranks, he can train dire, giant or prehistoric animals such as cave bears or giant hawks. With four ranks, he can train monstrosities of animal intelligence, such as griffons or owlbears, as well as vermin such as carrion horrors or black worms.

Every animal has a training period, typically between one to three months, determined by its type. Assuming that the training process begins when the animal is young (a baby or child), ittakes one training period to initially tame the animal and one additional training period to teach the animal its first trick. After the animal has learned its first trick, additional tricks can be taught in half a training period each. (If the taming and training process begins when the monster is already an adult or adolescent, then the training period is increased 6x for taming and 2x for each trick.) Each animal can normally be taught a maximum of 2d4 different tasks or tricks, though particularly agreeable, stubborn, stupid, or smart animals might be able to learn more or less. The animal trainer will only learn the animal’s limit when he reaches it.

A single trainer can train and manage up to six animals at once as a dedicated activity. However, if a trainer works one-on-one with a particular animal for its entire course of training (a process sometimes called animal whispering), the animal’s maximum number of tricks is increased by two. Once an animal is tamed and trained, a trainer can control up to one mount or warmount, 6 workbeasts, 6 droving creatures, or 20 guard creatures at once. The trainer gains a +1 bonus to reaction rolls when approaching tame but uncontrolled animals of any type he can train.

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Animal Training Proficiency Progression** | | | |
| **Title** | **Rank (# of times taken)** | **Wage** | **Trainable Animals** |
| Apprentice | 1 | 25gp | Domestic animal (dog, hawk, horse, etc.) |
| Journeyman | 2 | 75gp | Wild animal (bear, lion, etc.) |
| Master | 3 | 150gp | Dire, giant, or prehistoric animal (cave bear, dire wolf, etc.) |
| Grand Master | 4 | 250gp | Monstrosity or vermin (griffon, owlbeast, giant black worm, etc.) |

###### Arcane Dabbling

The character can attempt to use wands, staffs, and other magic items only useable by arcane spellcasters. The character does not need to know the command word for the item, but he must make a proficiency throw of 4+ or the attempt backfires with potentially disastrous consequences (Judge’s discretion).

###### Armor Training

The character gains proficiency in armor one weight category heavier than normally permitted by his class without penalty. Armor Training does not grant the character the ability to use thief skills in medium or heavy armor, nor to benefit from proficiencies or class powers that require light, very light, or no armor. Spellcasters who take Armor Training are able to cast spells in the armor they become proficient with.

###### Art/Craft (G)

The character has studied a fine art (e.g., painting, sculpture, mosaic) or a guild craft (e.g. armorer, bowyer, jeweler, leatherworker, smith, shipwright, or weaponsmith). The character is considered an apprentice in his trade. He can construct 10gp worth of goods per month of dedicated activity. He can identify masterwork items, rare materials, and famous artisans with a proficiency throw of 11+. The character must choose the art or craft at the time he chooses the proficiency. He can spend more proficiency selections to have several types of art or craft proficiencies.

If the character selects the same art or craft twice, he is considered a journeyman in his trade. He can identify with a proficiency throw of 7+. He can construct 20gp of goods per month of dedicated activity, and supervise up to 3 apprentices, increasing their productivity by 50%. He is considered an expert for purposes of evaluating merchandise in his field (see p. XX).

If he selects the same craft three times, he is considered a master craftsman. He can identify with a proficiency throw of 3+. He can construct 40gp per month of dedicated activity, and supervise up to 2 journeymen and 4 apprentices, increasing their productivity by 50%. He could work as a specialist in this art or craft.

If a character selects the same art or craft four times, he is considered a grand master artist or craftsman. He can identify with a proficiency throw of 2+. He can construct 80gp per month of dedicated activity, and supervise up to 2 masters, 4 journeymen, and 8 apprentices, increasing their productivity by 50% (for a total construction rate of 440gp per month). Working alone or with his subordinates, a grand master can create **masterwork items** (p. XX)appropriate to his art or craft. When items made by grand masters or above are discovered, their mark or style will be apparent to characters who make the appropriate Art, Craft, Knowledge, or Loremastery roll.

When performing Magic Experimentation relating to his Art or Craft proficiency (as determined by the GM), a character can add his ranks in the proficiency to his throw exclusively for purposes of determining whether he has achieved a breakthrough. In addition, a grandmaster in an Art or Craft gains one additional experimental advantage any time his experiment relates to his Art or Craft.

An artisan can work in an art or craft that is adjacent to his own art or craft as if he had one fewer rank in the proficiency. For instance, a master blacksmith could work as a journeyman armorer or a journeyman cartwright could work as an apprentice wheelwright. It is left to the Judge’s discretion to determine when two arts or crafts are similar enough for this rule to apply.

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Art/Craft Proficiency Progression** | | | |
| **Title** | **Rank (# of times taken)** | **Construction Rate** | **Number of Workers Allowed** |
| Apprentice | 1 | 10gp | N. A. |
| Journeyman | 2 | 20gp | 3 Apprentices |
| Master | 3 | 40gp | 2 Journeymen, 4 Apprentices |
| Grand Master | 4 | 80gp | 2 Masters, 4 Journeymen, 8 Apprentices |

###### Bargaining (G)

The character gets the best deals available for goods, services, and information. Any items the character purchases costs 10% less than the listed price and any items he sells go for 10% more than the listed price. If both the buyer and seller have the Bargaining proficiency,the opposed Bargainers should make reaction rolls. Whichever character scores the higher result gets the discount. (Special rules apply when using Bargaining for mercantile ventures, see p. XX.) A character can select Bargaining multiple times if desired. Each time the proficiency is selected, the character receives a +2 bonus on his reaction roll when negotiating with other bargainers.

###### Battle Magic

The character gains a +1 initiative bonus when casting spells. When casting spells that require an attack throw, his attack throw is determined using the fighter progression. If the character already uses the fighter progression, he gains a further +1 to hit.

###### Beast Friendship

The character is well-schooled in the natural world. He can identify plants and fauna with a proficiency throw of 11+. He understands the vocalizations and body language of birds and beasts, enabling him to understand any simple messages the animals might be communicating (such as “danger is nearby, be alert,” “you’re unfamiliar and strange,” or “do not come closer, we are guarding our den!”). Because of his innate understanding of the language of beasts, the character also counts as proficient for purposes of handling trained animals in their roles such as droving or shepherding. He gains +2 to all reaction rolls when encountering normal animals and can take animals as henchmen. He can train and handle animal henchmen to perform tricks or serve a particular role without having to separately possess Animal Training. If the character has the Friends of Bird and Beast class power, he can identify plants and fauna with a throw of 7+ and can take one more henchman than his Charisma would otherwise permit, as long as at least one is an animal. (The bonus to reaction rolls does not increase.)

###### Berserkergang

The character can enter a berserker rage anytime he takes a combat action. While enraged, he gains a +2 bonus to attack throws in melee or with thrown weapons and becomes immune to the cowering, faltering, and frightened conditions and never checks morale. However, the character has a -2 penalty to AC and becomes limited in his tactics. He cannot conduct defensive movement to retreat or withdraw from an enemy within 5’ and cannot move in such a way that the distance between himself and the nearest visible threat would increase. He must advance 5’ after cleaving if necessary to do so to engage an enemy and he has sufficient movement. Once it has begun, a berserker rage cannot be ended until combat ends.

###### Black Lore of Zahar

The character has studied the terrible necromancies of ancient Zahar. He can control undead as a Chaotic crusader of one half his class level (rounded down). If the character casts death spells, his targets suffer a -2 penalty on their saving throws. When the character casts necromantic spells (such as *animate undead*), the spell effects are calculated as if he were two class levels higher than his actual level of experience. His eligibility to research death or necromancy magic is determined as if he were two caster levels higher than actual. He gains a +2 bonus on magic research throws and increases his research rate by 10% when researching death or necromancy magic. Black Lore of Zahar can stack with the Secrets of the Dark Arts class power, such that the character can control undead as a crusader of two-thirds his class level (rounded up), and his death and necromancy spells and research are calculated as if he were three (rather than two) caster levels higher than his actual caster level.

###### Blind Fighting

The character can fight a target without being able to see it. Blind Fighting is typically used when the character is in darkness or when the target is outside the range of his sight. A character with this proficiencysuffers only a -2 penalty on attack throws when blinded or fighting invisible enemies instead of the base -4 penalty. He does not suffer a penalty to surprise rolls from being blinded, nor is his speed reduced.

###### Bribery

The character is exceptionally skilled at bribing officials with gifts of money or merchandise. He gains a +1 bonus to reaction rolls if he offers one day’s pay for the target; a +2 bonus for a week’s pay; and a +3 bonus for a month’s pay. His bribery is so subtle that the attempt is politely deniable by both parties. The character is only blatant enough to be charged with the crime of bribery if he rolls an unmodified 2. See Offering Bribes (p. XX).

###### Bright Lore of Aura

The character has studied the white magic of the Empyreans. The character can rebuke undead as a crusader of one half his class level (rounded down). If the character casts spells that require a Paralysis saving throw, his targets suffer a -2 penalty on the save. When the character casts protection spells (including dispels), the spell effects are calculated as if he were two caster levels higher than his actual caster level. His eligibility to research protection magic is determined as if he were two caster levels higher than actual. He gains a +2 bonus on magic research throws and increases his research rate by 10% when researching protection magic.

###### Cat Burglary

The character knows how to deftly move across narrow and precarious paths. He gains a +4 bonus when attempting balancing traverses. He never falls while traversing narrow paths and only fails when traversing precarious paths on an unmodified 1. He gains a +2 to saving throws where perfect balance would help avoid the danger. If the character falls while climbing, he can make a second proficiency throw with a -4 penalty in order to catch himself and prevent any damage.

###### Caving (G)

The character has learned to keep a map in his head of where he is when exploring underground caves, cavern complexes, and subterranean rivers. He is able to accurately estimate length, width, and depth when he travels with almost no error. On a proficiency throw of 11+, the character with this proficiency will be able to automatically know the route he has taken to get where he is, if he was conscious at the time. This proficiency can be selected multiple times.

###### Climbing

The character can climb as a thief of his class level. He must make a Climbing proficiency throw for each 100’ climbed (with a minimum of one check required). If the throw succeeds, the character ascends or descends by up to 100’ safely. If the throw fails, he falls a distance equal to half the attempted distance, plus the distance covered by any previous throws, taking 1d6 bludgeoning damage per 10 feet. The character can climb at his exploration speed or one-third his combat speed without penalty. If he moves at one-half combat speed, he takes a -5 penalty to the proficiency throw, and if he moves at full combat speed, he takes a -10 penalty.

###### Collegiate Wizardry (G)

The character has received arcane instruction as an apprentice to a mage, pupil at a magical academy, or member of an arcane organization. If he is an arcane spellcaster, he can begin play as a member of a wizard’s guild or similar order (Judge’s discretion). He can automatically identify arcane symbols, spell signatures, trappings, and grimoires of his own order or tradition, and can recognize those of other orders or traditions with a proficiency throw of 11+. Rare or esoteric traditions can be harder to recognize. A character can select this proficiency additional times.

###### Combat Ferocity

The character is an aggressive warrior who never fails to exploit an advantage. The character’s maximum number of cleaves is increased by 1.

###### Combat Reflexes

True warriors never hesitate in combat. The character gains a +1 bonus to surprise rolls and initiative rolls. This bonus does not apply when casting spells.

###### Combat Trickery

The character is a cunning and tricky fighter. Pick a special maneuver from any one of the following: Disarm, Force Back, Incapacitate, Knock Down, Overrun, Sunder, or Wrestling. When the character attempts this special maneuver in combat, the normal penalty for attempting the maneuver is reduced by 2 (e.g. from -4 to -2), and his opponent suffers a -2 penalty to his saving throw to resist the special maneuver. If the special maneuver does not afford the target a saving throw, then the penalty for attempting the maneuver is reduced by 4 (to 0). See **Special Maneuvers** (p. XX) for more details. A character can take Combat Trickery multiple times, selecting an additional special maneuver to learn each time.

###### Command

The character has mastered the art of command. His authority inspires men to follow him into danger. The character’s henchmen, mercenaries, and other troops receive a +2 bonus to morale. Morale is explained in **Hirelings**, **Henchmen**, **Mercenaries**, **and Specialists** (p. XX).

###### Contemplation

The character can enter a meditative trance and re-gain the ability to cast a spell of a level he had previously expended. Contemplation is an ancillary activity requiring one hour (6 turns) of undisturbed meditation. A character cannot regain the same level of spell more than once per day through contemplation.

###### Contortionism

The character is extremely flexible, able to squeeze or fold his body in ways that seem humanly impossible, including squeezing between bars and escaping chains and restraints. He gains a +4 bonus to Paralysis saving throws to escape being grabbed, restrained, stuck, or wrestled. He can make a proficiency throw each round to escape from physical shackles or to slip between the bars of a portcullis. At 1st level the character must make a proficiency throw of 18+ to succeed. The proficiency throw required reduces by 1 per level. If the throw fails, the character remains shackled. If it succeeds, he slips free of his bonds.

###### Counterspelling

The character is considered two caster levels higher than his actual caster level for purposes of dispelling magic or penetrating a target’s magic resistance. If the character also has Bright Lore of Aura proficiency, the bonus to caster level partially stacks; the caster is considered three levels higher rather than two for purposes of dispelling magic.

###### Diplomacy (G)

The character is smooth tongued and familiar with protocol. He receives a +1 bonus on all reaction rolls when he attempts to parley. This bonus stacks with Mystic Aura, but not with Intimidation or Seduction.

###### Disguise (G)

The character can make himself or a subject resemble a specific person. The person can be a real person (e.g. “the priestess Genelen of Türos Tem”) or a fictional persona the character makes up for purposes of his disguise (e.g. “an orc scout named Grik”). When creating the disguise, the character must have access to a disguise kit with cosmetics and wigs, as well as to any clothing and accessories necessary for the disguise. If imitating a real person of the same race or any humanoid creature of another race, he must also have either a detailed sketch of the person or race to be imitated, or be personally familiar with the person or race. Once put on, the disguise lasts until the character takes it off or until the character bathes, disrobes, or gets wet. Discarding a disguise takes one full round.

Creating the disguise is an ancillary activity requiring 6 turns (one hour). At the end of the time, the character must make a proficiency throw of 11+. The character gains a +2 bonus if disguising himself as a fictional persona of his own making. He suffers a -2 penalty to his throw if imitating another sex, another race, or another age than himself (all penalties are cumulative). If the throw fails, the disguise fools no one, but the character can try again if desired.

If the throw succeeds, the character has made an excellent disguise that will fool most people. A creature who is intimately familiar with the disguised character or the person being imitated might see through it. After the creature spends one round interacting with the disguised character, it can make a proficiency throw 14+ to identify the character, adding its Will modifier to the die roll. The creature can check again after one turn (10 minutes) of interaction, one hour of interaction, and every eight hours of interaction thereafter.

This proficiency can be selected multiple times. Each time it is taken, the character gains a +2 bonus to his proficiency throw, while those attempting to see through his disguise suffer a -2 penalty.

###### Divine Blessing

The character knows how to propitiate the gods and gain their favor. He gains a +2 bonus to all saving throws.

###### Divine Health

The character knows how to purify his body and soul. He is immune to all forms of disease, including magical diseases caused by spells, lycanthropes, or undead.

###### Driving (G)

The character is an expert at driving animals, both on foot and harnessed to wheeled vehicles. When he is driving animals, he can control up to 6 droving animals, keeping them within a manageable distance while moving in the desired direction. When he is driving a cart, chariot, wagon or other vehicle on a road or trail, the movement bonus from the road is increased to 2x (road conditions permitting).

###### Dungeonbashing Expertise

The character is hardened to the heavy lifting and physical labor involved in dungeon exploration. The character receives a +4 bonus on Dungeonbashing throws to open doors or perform similar acts of brute strength.

###### Dwarven Brewing

The character knows the secrets of the famed beer and ale of the dwarves. Because of his familiarity with mixology, he can make a proficiency throw of 11+ to determine the magical properties of a potion or oil by smell. If he has access to dwarven brewing equipment, piltbier, and special mushrooms, he can make dwarven brews. See Chapter 9: **Dwarven Mycoculture** of ***By This Axe***for detailed rules on dwarven brewing. If not using ***By This Axe****,* the effects of dwarven brews are up to the Judge’s discretion.

###### Eavesdropping

The character can listen for noises as a thief of his class level. The Judge makes a Listening proficiency throw in secret on behalf of the character. If the throw succeeds, he hears any noises in earshot. If the throw fails, or if there aren’t any noises in earshot, he doesn’t hear anything. The character must be quiet and in a quiet environment. Listening only requires one round but can only be undertaken once per turn (10 minutes) if the party is moving at all, because it takes time for people to settle down into quiet.

###### Elementalism

The character is a master of a particular element (either air, earth, fire, water). Spells using this element do +1 damage per die and impose a -2 saving throw penalty on the target. Elementals summoned from this element gain +1 hp per Hit Die. The character’s *mage missiles* are elemental and deal an additional damage type based on his element — electric, seismic, fire, or cold for air, earth, fire, and water respectively. The character can automatically identify and rank a place of power related to his element upon entering it. A character can take this proficiency multiple times, selecting an additional element each time.

###### Elven Bloodline

The character has the blood of the ageless elves in his ancestry. His lifespan is as long as an elf’s, and he shows no signs of aging. His robust vitality grants him a +1 bonus to his HD roll at 1st level. He also enjoys an elf’s immunity to diseases caused by undead. The character’s ancestry manifests somehow in his appearance (pointed ears, golden eyes, a strange birthmark, or other unusual trait).

###### Endurance (G)

The character is nearly tireless. He does not need to rest every 6 turns of strenuous activity. He gains a +4 bonus to Paralysis saving throws to avoid becoming **winded**. He can undertake strenuous dedicated activities every day without becoming fatigued. He can work overtime or force march for one day without becoming **fatigued**, plus one additional day for each point of Constitution bonus. Provided the character does not become fatigued, he just needs a night of restful sleep to be able to work normally the following day. If the character also takes the Labor proficiency, he can work overtime or force march for one additional day.

###### Engineering (G)

The character is skilled in planning, designing, and constructing castles, towers, roads, and so forth. He can evaluate constructions the party is passing through to assess what shape they are in, when and by whom they were built, etc., with a proficiency throw of 11+.He can personally work on projects at a construction rate of 1.33gp per day of dedicated activity. He can supervise others as a dedicated activity, leading projects worth up to 25,000gp. This proficiency can be selected multiple times, increasing the size of construction project he can supervise by 25,000gp with each rank taken. A character who has taken this proficiency four times is the equivalent of the engineer specialist described in the **Specialists** section.

###### Expanded Repertoire

The character’s spell repertoire can contain one additional spell of each level that he can cast. For instance, a 1st level mage with this proficiency has a repertoire of 2 1st level spells, while a 5th level mage with this proficiency has a repertoire of 3 1st, 3 2nd, and 2 3rd level spells.

###### Experimenting

The character is a genius, perhaps mad, but unquestionably insightful. For purposes of level requirements, he can engage in experimenting as if he were two class levels higher than actual. He only suffers automatic failure when experimenting on an unmodified roll of 1 – 2 (instead of 1 – 3).

###### Familiar

The character gains the service of a magical spirit in the guise of a beast. Familiars can be selected from the list belowor devised by the Judge. (Except where otherwise permitted, all familiars are animals of less than 1 HD.) Familiars have hit points equal to half their master’s hit points, and attack and save as mages equal to their master’s level. While a familiar is within 30’ of its master, the master gains a +1 bonus to all saving throws and gains one class proficiency. The proficiency is selected from his class list at the time the familiar is chosen and cannot be one the master already has. A familiar is always considered in range of its master for purposes of *clairvoyancy* and *clairaudiency*. If the familiar is reduced to 0 hp, it dies and the master immediately suffers damage equal to the familiar’s maximum hit points. The familiar cannot be restored to life but instead returns to the character when he reaches his next level of experience. (If he is maximum level, his familiar is not restored; instead he receives the former familiar’s class proficiency as his own.)

| **Fighting Style Specializations** | |
| **Fighting Style** | **Bonus** |
| Missile weapon | +1 to attack throws |
| Single weapon | +1 to initiative |
| Dual weapons | +1 to attack throws |
| Two-handed weapon | +1 to damage rolls |
| Weapon and shield | +1 to armor class |

###### Fighting Style Specialization

The character specializes in a particular fighting style, such as dual weapon or weapon and shield, in which he is already proficient. Because of his familiarity with the fighting style, the specialized character gains a special bonus when the character is fighting in that style. The fighting styles and their bonuses are listed on the adjoining table. The bonuses are in addition to the standard bonuses for fighting in the given manner. For instance, a character with weapon and shield fighting style proficiency gains a total improvement to his AC of 2 points. A character can take this proficiency multiple times, selecting an additional fighting style each time. If a character has two fighting styles that might be applicable in a given fight, he must choose which bonus will apply in any given round at the start of his initiative. For example, if a character armed with a sling in one hand and a shield in the other hand has both Fighting Style Specialization (missile weapon) and (weapon and shield), he must choose between +1 to attack throws or +1 to AC, but cannot take both bonuses at the same time.

###### Folkways (G)

The character is familiar with the customs, figures of speech, manners, and traditions of a particular urban settlement. He gains a +1 bonus to reaction rolls with 0th level characters he encounters in his settlement. He can automatically identify famous landmarks and points of interest in his settlement, and never gets lost when traveling through it. This proficiency can be selected multiple times, adding an additional familiar settlement each time.

###### Gambling (G)

The character has the ability to win money in games of chance and skill. He can earn 1d6!gp per week of dedicated activity as a professional gambler. The character can select Gambling additional times if desired, increasing his weekly income by 1d6!gp with each selection. If multiple characters with Gambling proficiency face each other in a game, the result can be determined by having each gambler roll 1d6! Per rank of proficiency. (Non-proficient characters roll 1d4.) The gambler who rolled the highest die wins the round (hand, trick, etc.) and collects its pot. If two or more gamblers are tied for the highest die, the other gamblers lose and the tied gamblers re-roll against each other. There are a number of popular games of skill in the Auran Empire, some of which are listed below.

| Kyrpeges (“wargame”), a strategy boardgame played with miniatures on a grid. Two patrons are playing while the rest bet on the outcome. |
| Destri Spevas (“horse and chariot”), a boardgame where up to seven players roll dice to race their token around an oval track. |
| Calefan Esevi (“lucky sevens”), a game of chance played with a deck of 49 cards. Players compete to be the closest to a hand of 7. |
| Draxës (“dice”), a game of chance played with three six-sided dice. Up to seven patrons are placing bets as they alternate rolling. |

###### Goblin-Slaying

The character has been trained to ruthlessly cut down his race’s humanoid foes. He receives +1 on attack throws against kobolds, goblins, orcs, gnolls, hobgoblins, bugbears, ogres, trolls, and giants. At level 7, this bonus increases to +2, and at level 13 it increases to +3.

###### Healing (G)

The character is skilled at caring for sick and wounded humans, demi-humans, giants, and other humanoids. As a dedicated activity, the character can care for three patients at a time, plus an additional each time Healing is selected (e.g. four patients with one rank, five with two ranks, etc.) A wounded patient under the character’s care automatically regains an extra 1d3 hit points per day of rest if provided with sanitary conditions and proper food. If a patient under his care is sick or poisoned, the character can attempt to diagnose the disease or poison. Diagnosis requires one turn (10 minutes) of medical examination and a proficiency throw of 11+. If the throw succeeds, the character identifies whether the disease or poison is magical or mundane, and if mundane, diagnoses it. If the throw fails, he does not identify or diagnose the disease or poison. He cannot try again until the patient develops further symptoms. The character can use healing herbs (p. XX) to treat poisoned, sick, and/or wounded patients.

If the character selects Healingtwice, he is a physicker. He can now diagnose illness on 7+. He can also attempt to non-magically *neutralize poison*,*cure**disease*,or *cure**light**injury* on a poisoned, sick, or wounded patient. He must have successfully diagnosed a disease or poison before attempting to cure it. Each attempt requires one turn (10 minutes) and a proficiency throw of 18+. If the throw succeeds, the healing effect occurs as if the spell had been cast. If the throw fails, there is no effect. Whether the throw succeeds or not, he cannot try again with that effect on that patient until the following day, though another healer can.

If the character selects Healingthree times, he is a chirurgeon. He can now diagnose illness on 3+. He can *neutralize**poison*,*cure**disease*,or *cure**serious**injury*on a poisoned, sick, or wounded patient with a proficiency throw of 14+.

The ability to treat the ill provides the character with a number of other useful abilities. With one rank of Healing, the character can harvest components from humanoids. With two ranks, he can harvest components from corporeal undead. With a combined two ranks of Animal Husbandry and/or Healing, he can harvest components from beastmen, and with a combined three ranks, from monstrosities.

Because most creatures share many anatomical traits, a character with this proficiency can use it on animals, monstrosities, and vermin at a -4 penalty.

| **Healing Proficiency Progression** | | | | |
| **Title** | **Rank (# of**  **times taken)** | **Gp Earned**  **/ Month** | **Patients**  **/ Day** | **Skills** |
| Healer | 1 | 25gp | 3 | Identify 11+, extra 1d3 hit points per day, healing herbs |

| Chirurgeon | 3 | 100gp | 5 | Identify 3+, *neutralize* *poison*, *cure* *disease*, *cure* *serious* 14+ |

###### Illusion Resistance

The character is as hard to fool as the most cynical dwarf. He automatically attempts to disbelieve any illusions he encounters. (The Judge makes the roll in secret so the character is not aware when he has failed.) If he deliberately attempts to disbelieve an illusion, he receives +4 bonus on his throw.

###### Intimidation (G)

The character knows how to bully others to get what he wants. He receives a +1 bonus on all reaction rolls when implicitly or explicitly threatening violence or dire consequences. The targets must be less than 5HD or the character and his allies must outnumber or grossly outrank the targets. This bonus stacks with Mystic Aura, but not with Diplomacy or Seduction.

###### Kin-Slaying

The character has been trained to ruthlessly cut down his chthonic master’s foes. He receives +1 on attack throws against humans, elves, dwarves, halflings, gnomes, and Nobir. At level 7, this bonus increases to +2, and at level 13 it increases to +3.

###### Knowledge (G)

The character has made a specialized study of a particular field, such as architecture, astrology, geography, history, mathematics, metaphysics, natural history, natural philosophy, or political economy. The character can usually make his living by acting as an expert on the subject. With a proficiency throw of 11+, the character can recall expert commentary or information relating to his area of knowledge. The character must choose his area of knowledge at the time he chooses the proficiency. He can spend more proficiency selections to have several different areas of knowledge.

If a character selects the same knowledge twice, he is an expert in the subject and can train students and write books on the topic. If he selects the same subject three times, he is a scholar who could teach experts. If he also has Loremastery and Magical Engineering proficiencies, he can work as a sage (as described in **Specialists,** p. XX).

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Knowledge Proficiency Progression** | | | |
| **Title** | **Rank (# of times taken)** | **Gp Earned / Month** | **Skills** |
| Student | 1 | 25gp | Identify 11+ |
| Expert | 2 | 50gp | Identify 7+ |
| Scholar | 3 | 100gp | Identify 3+ |

###### Labor (G)

The character is highly proficient at a particular type of physical labor, such as bricklaying, farming, mining, or stonecutting. He has a construction rate of 2sp per day of dedicated activity on projects relating to his proficiency. The character can make his living off his labors, earning 6gp per month. Because he is hardened to labor, the character can undertake strenuous dedicated activities every day without becoming fatigued. A character can learn other labor proficiencies by taking this proficiency multiple times. Labor does not require enough skill to be able to be improved by taking this proficiency multiple times. However, if the character also takes the Endurance proficiency, Labor enables him to force march for one additional day.

Some types of labor have additional benefits for adventure. Labor (construction) lets the character build temporary defensive works. Labor (farming) and Labor (butchery) enable a character to skin, flesh, and butcher creatures for pelts and meats. Labor (butchery) enables the character to extract special components from animals. The Judge can devise other benefits for labor if desired.

###### Land Surveying

The character is an expert at surveying the land around him. The character can attempt to assess the land value of a hex to determine if it is worth settling (see p. XX). The character can also attempt to assess the total number of lairs in the hex based on the lay of the land, evidence of cultivation, and other factors (see p. When moving at expedition or exploration speed in the wilderness, he habitually scans for dangers such as collapses, deadfalls, rock slides or sinkholes. Anytime he encounters such a danger, the Judge secretly makes a Land Surveying proficiency throw on his behalf. On a throw of 14+, the character detects the danger. By spending one turn (10 minutes), the character can methodically survey an area of up to 10,000 square feet for such dangers, with 10+ succeeding.

###### Language (G)

This proficiency enables the character to learn to speak, read, and write an additional three languages of his choice. The character’s level of literacy with the new language is determined by his Intellect. Characters with an Intellect of 8 or less are generally illiterate. However, this proficiency can be taken by a character with a low Intellect (8 or less) in order to become literate in the language(s) the character already speaks. This proficiency can be selected multiple times, learning an additional three languages each time.

###### Laying on Hands

The character can heal himself or another by laying on hands once per day. If he lays hands on a wounded creature, he can restore 2 hit points per experience level. If he lays hands on an incapacitated creature, he can grant a bonus to their Mortal Wounds throw of one-half his class level (round up). If he lays hands on a paralyzed creature, he can cure the paralysis. A character can take this proficiency multiple times. Each time it is taken, the character can lay on hands an additional time per day.

###### Leadership (G)

The character is an inspirational authority figure who earns great loyalty. The character can hire one more henchman than his Charisma would otherwise permit, and the base morale score of any domain he rules is increased by 1. Domain morale is explained in the **Campaigns** chapter (p. XX).

###### Lip Reading (G)

The character can “overhear” conversations spoken in a language he understands. If the subject of his lip reading is not speaking clearly in bright light, the character might need to make a successful Listening proficiency throw in order to determine if he gleans the appropriate information.

###### Lockpicking Expertise

The character is an expert with locks. He gains a +2 bonus on Lockpicking proficiency throws. When hastily picking a lock, he only botches on an unmodified roll of 1 (instead of 1 - 3), and he never botches when methodically picking a lock.

###### Loremastery

The character is knowledgeable on a variety of esoteric subjects. At 1st level, the character can make a proficiency throw of 18+ to decipher occult runes, remember ancient history, or identify a historic artifact or special monster part. The proficiency throw required reduces by 1 per level. The character can identify magic items as if he were a 5th level mage. If the character can already identify magic items, he can do so with a +2 bonus to his magic research throw and +10% bonus to his research rate.

###### Magical Engineering

The character has specialized knowledge of magical items. With one rank of Magical Engineering, the character gains a +1 bonus on magic research throws and increases his research rate by 5%. He can recognize conventional and usual magical items or special components by examining them for one turn (10 minutes) with a proficiency throw of 11+. He can extract special components from constructs. He cannot, however, recognize unusual or unique magical items, discern command words, distinguish trapped or cursed items from safe ones, or assess the specific bonus or number of charges remaining in an item. This proficiency can be selected multiple times, each time adding an additional +1 bonus to magical research throws, increasing research rate by 5%, and improving the proficiency throw required to recognize conventional items by 4.

###### Magical Music

The character’s performances can be used to cause certain emotions to arise in his spectators. When this proficiency is selected, the character learns two musical effects. Each musical effect is the equivalent to a 1st level enchantment spell. The available musical effects are:

* **Drowsiness**: Cast *slumber* on an audience of one or more creatures by performing a melodic lullaby
* **Goodwill:** Casts *beguile humanoid* on an audience of one creature by performing a song praising their virtues.
* **Horror:** Cast *frighten humanoid* on an audience of one creature by performing a song with disturbing and haunting chords.
* **Outrage:** Cast *infuriate humanoid* on an audience of one creature by performing a song ridiculing its beliefs and reputation.

The Judge can add or devise other musical effects if desired. To use Magical Music, the character must select a musical effect for his performance and decide the audience (i.e. target creatures) that his performance addresses based on the chosen effect. The target creatures are selected with eye contact, hand gesture, and other flourishes, and know they are the targets of the character’s performance. The target creatures must be within earshot and line of sight of the character, be able to understand the character’s language, and not already be in combat. (If the character has Beast Friendship, that counts as being able to understand the language of animals, and musical effects that he causes that would target humanoids can instead target animals.)

Once the audience is selected, the character starts performing. He makes a proficiency throw against a target value of 11+. The proficiency throw required reduces by 1 per level. The character must have at least one rank of Performance (either from a class power or proficiency). If the character has additional ranks of Performance, he gains a +1 bonus for each rank to his throw, up to two additional ranks. If the proficiency throw is successful, the musical effect begins immediately and lasts until the character ends his performance. If the character performs for a full turn (10 minutes), the effect lasts until the character ends his performance and then for the duration of the spell thereafter. If the proficiency throw fails, the magical music has no effect and cannot be tried again on the same audience that turn. This proficiency can be selected multiple times, learning two additional musical effects each time.

###### Manual of Arms (G)

The character is highly experienced in military discipline, physical fitness, and weapon drill. He can automatically identify the battle standards, equipment, great captains, military slang, and rank insignia of his homeland. He can identify those of other realms with a proficiency throw of 11+. He can fight as a regular (rather than irregular) troop in formed and loose units. He can begin play as a member of a legion, mercenary’s guild, or other military organization (Judge’s discretion).

If the character learns additional ranks of Manual of Arms, he can serve as a marshal capable of training up to 60 troops simultaneously as a dedicated activity.

* If the character has two ranks, he can train light infantry or slingers (1 month training period). If the character also has Mounted Combat or Riding, he can also train light cavalry (3 months). If he also has Fighting Style Specialization (missile weapons) or Weapon Focus (bows & crossbows), he can also train crossbowmen (1 month), bowmen (2 months), or longbowmen (3 months). If the character can train both bowmen and light cavalry, he can also train horse archers (6 months).
* If the character has three ranks, he can train heavy infantry (1 month). If he can train both heavy infantry and light cavalry, he can train medium and heavy cavalry (6 months). If the character can train both bowmen and heavy cavalry, he can train cataphract cavalry (12 months).

Once a character has trained troops, he can maintain them in a high state of readiness by inspecting them. Inspection takes one turn (10 minutes) per 60 troops and grants a +1 bonus to morale for one day. A character can only inspect troop types he can train.

###### Mapping (G)

The character can understand and make maps, even if he cannot read or write. He can create useful maps by torchlight while moving at exploration speed or less. By spending one turn (10 minutes) in thought, and succeeding on a proficiency throw of 11+, he can interpret or draft complicated layouts, map an area by memory, or notice an irregularity in a map he has created. This proficiency can be selected multiple times.

###### Martial Training

The character has proficiency in weapons that are unusual for his class. Select one of the following types of weapons and add these to the list of weapons with which the character is proficient: (1) axes; (2) bows/crossbows; (3) flails/hammers/maces; (4) swords/daggers; (5) spears/polearms; (6) bolas/nets/slings/saps/staffs/staff-slings; (7) any four weapons. When selecting option 7, the character can only select composite bow or long bow if he already has or also selects short bow; and the character can only select spear or polearm if he already has or also selects javelin. Note that Martial Training does not afford the character the ability to use fighting styles with which he is not proficient, so a character who selects e.g. spears/polearms will not be able to use a polearm unless he already has two-handed weapon fighting style. A divine caster who selects this proficiency is granted an exemption by his deity that permits use of the weapon(s).

###### Mastery of Conjuration & Summoning

When the character casts summoning spells (such as*conjure fiend*or *summon**shadow*), the spell effects are calculated as if he were two caster levels higher than his actual level of experience. (This makes them harder to dispel.) If the character loses his concentration due to taking damage while controlling a conjured creature, he must make a Spells saving throw. If the save succeeds, he maintains his concentration. His eligibility to conduct research on summoning magic is determined as if he were two caster levels higher than actual. He gains a +2 bonus on magic research throws and increases his research rate by 10% when researching summoning magic. Mastery of Conjuration and Summoning can stack with the Conjure Dark Powers class power, such that the character’s summoning spells are calculated as if he were three (rather than two) caster levels higher and he gains a +2 bonus on his Spells saving throw to maintain concentration.

###### Mastery of Enchantments & Illusions

When the character casts enchantment spells (such as*bewitch**person*) or illusionspells (such as *phantasmal**figment*), the spell effects are calculated as if he were two caster levels higher than his actual level of experience. Targets of his enchantment and illusion spells suffer a -2 penalty to their saving throw. His eligibility to conduct research on enchantment and illusion magic is determined as if he were two caster levels higher than actual. He gains a +2 bonus on magic research throws and increases his research rate by 10% when researching enchantment or illusion magic.

###### Military Strategy (G)

The character has studied the art of war and the methods of the great captains. He can recognize famous historical battles, generals, and weapons with a proficiency throw of 11+. Forces under his command receive a +1 bonus to initiative rolls in mass combat. This proficiency can be selected multiple times, each time improving the proficiency throw to recognize by 4 and adding an additional +1 bonus to mass combat initiative, to a maximum of +3.

###### Mimicry (G)

The character can imitate animal calls and foreign language accents. With a proficiency throw of 11+, the character’s mimicry (e.g. imitating the screech of a hoot owl or a noise from some other animal) is so authentic as to fool even trained naturalists into believing they have heard the actual animal. This proficiency can be selected multiple times.

###### Mountaineering (G)

The character knows how to use mountaineering gear to climb difficult mountains and cliff faces and to lead a party of up to 30 characters to tackle those faces as well. To count as having mountaineering gear, the character must have a grappling hook, and he and each character he assists must have a hand axe, a small hammer, a set of 6 iron spikes, and at least 50’ of rope. If the character does not have the Climbing proficiency (or equivalent class power), the proficiency throw for he and his party to climb, rappel, or traverse using mountaineering gear equals that of a thief of his class level. If the character does have Climbing, then his party can climb, rappel, or traverse as thieves of his class level, while his own proficiency throw only fails on an unmodified roll of 1 provided he does not exceed one-half combat speed. This proficiency does not allow the character to climb sheer surfaces during combat or without mountaineering gear.

###### Mounted Combat

The character can ride a saddled riding animal under combat conditions without penalty. He gains a +1 bonus to attack throws while mounted. If the character also has Riding proficiency, he can ride without a saddle, bit, or bridle in combat conditions without penalty.

###### Mystic Aura

The character has learned to project his magical powers in a way that causes awe in those that share the character’s presence. He gains a +1 bonus to reaction rolls to impress and intimidate people he encounters. If this bonus results in a total of 12 or more, the subjects act as if **bewitched** while in his presence. Once the subject leaves the character’s presence, the **bewitchment** ends. If the character interacted with the subject with finesse and tact, limiting any requests to the bounds of reason, the subject might be unaware that he was even **bewitched**. However, if the character makes dangerous or unusual demands the subject to which he would not ordinarily agree, the subject will deduce he was **bewitched** once the effect ends. Characters who brazenly exploit this power will acquire a reputation as enchanters or evil eyes, and be avoided and shunned lest they find more victims.

###### Naturalism (G)

The character is knowledgeable of common plant and animal life forms. By spending one turn (10 minutes) and making a successful proficiency throw of 11+, the character can appraise the value of a monster’s parts, identify venomous monsters, poisonous plants, or healing herbs, and detect any signs of unnatural danger (such as unusual quiet, atypical animal behavior, etc.).

The character can also attempt to forage for healing herbs or poisonous plants. Each attempt requires one day of dedicated activity and a proficiency throw. (The target value is set by the Judge depending on the rarity of the plant, typically 16 – 20.) If the throw succeeds, the character gathers 1 stone of fresh plants, enough to extract one dose of poison or one healing herbs. If the throw fails, the character’s search is fruitless. If the throw fails on an unmodified 1, the character has accidentally exposed himself to a plant toxin (either the one he was looking for or a random toxin.) The character must immediately make a successful Death saving throw or suffer the toxin’s effects.

###### Navigation (G)

The character can take the position of the sun and stars to determine roughly where he is. He gains a +4 bonus on proficiency throws to avoid getting lost in the wilderness. If he also has at least one rank of Seafaring, he can serve as a navigator on a seagoing vessel as described in **Specialists**. The bonus from this proficiency stacks with the explorer and venturer’s Pathfinding class power. A character can select this proficiency multiple times.

###### Passing Without Trace

The character leaves no sign of his passing over terrain, and cannot be tracked. For every level of experience, the character can cover the tracks of an additional traveling companion. Characters who are passing without trace do not count against party size for purposes of evasion (p. XX).

###### Performance (G)

The character can act, dance, sing, recite poetry, tell stories, or play musical instruments in a skilled manner. The character chooses the type of performance that his character knows, and the character can take the proficiency several times in order to know multiple types of performance. The character is considered an apprentice in his style. He can earn 10gp per month from his performances, and can identify famous performers, masterpieces, and rare instruments with a proficiency throw of 11+.

If a character selects the same type of performance twice, he is considered a journeyman in his trade. He can earn 20gp per month of dedicated activity from his performances, and lead a troupe of up to 3 apprentices, increasing their productivity by 50%. If he selects the same type of performance three times, he is considered a master of his field. He can earn 40gp per month of dedicated activity from his performances, and lead a troupe of up to 2 journeymen and 4 apprentices, increasing their productivity by 50%.

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Performance Proficiency Progression** | | | |
| **Title** | **Rank (# of times taken)** | **Gp Earned/Month** | **Number of Workers Allowed** |
| Apprentice | 1 | 10gp | N. A. |
| Journeyman | 2 | 20gp | 3 Apprentices |
| Master Performer | 3 | 40gp | 2 Journeymen, 4 Apprentices |
|  |  |  |  |

###### Poisoning

The character is an expert at identifying, extracting, and using natural toxins and venoms. He can identify poisonous plants and venomous monsters and distinguish their different poisons as if he had one rank of Naturalism. He can extract venom from slain creatures as if he had one rank of Animal Husbandry. He can extract toxins from plants as if he had one rank of Alchemy. (If he already has ranks of Animal Husbandry, Alchemy, or Naturalism, he functions as if having an additional rank.) He does not botch when extracting or using poison.

###### Precise Shooting

The character can make a missile attack against an unengaged enemy target without penalty, even past cover or **engaged** allies. The character can attack an engaged enemy target at a -4 penalty. A character can take this proficiency multiple times. Each time the proficiency is taken, the penalty to attack opponents in melee is reduced by 2. Characters without this proficiency cannot attack opponents engaged in melee with missile attacks and suffer a -4 penalty to attack enemy targets through a melee.

###### Prestidigitation

The character can magically accomplish simple illusions and sleight of hand tricks suitable for impressing peasants, such as lighting a candle or shuffling cards, at will. The character must be able to perform the task physically, and be free to speak and gesture. He can use magical sleight-of-hand to pick pockets as a thief of one-half his class level (rounded up).

###### Profession (G)

The character is highly skilled at a civil profession, such as actuary, banker, chamberlain, judge, lawyer, librarian, merchant, restaurateur, scribe, or seneschal. The character is considered an apprentice in his profession. He can earn 25gp per month of dedicated activity performing his services, and can make expert commentary on subjects pertaining to his profession with a proficiency throw of 11+. The character must choose the profession at the time he chooses the proficiency. He can spend more proficiency selections to have several types of profession proficiencies. If a character selects the same profession twice, he is considered a licensed practitioner of his profession. He can earn 50gp per month of dedicated activity performing for his services, and supervise up to 3 apprentices, increasing their productivity by 50%. He is considered an expert for purposes of evaluating merchandise related to his field (see p. XX). If he selects the same profession three times, he is considered a master of his profession. He can earn 100gp per month of dedicated activity, and supervise up to 2 practitioners and 4 apprentices, increasing their productivity by 50%.

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Profession Proficiency Progression** | | | |
| **Title** | **Rank (# of times taken)** | **Gp Earned/Month** | **Number of Workers Allowed** |
| Apprentice | 1 | 25gp | N. A. |
| Licensed Practitioner | 2 | 50gp | 3 Apprentices |
| Master of Profession | 3 | 100gp | 2 Journeymen, 4 Apprentices |

###### Prophecy

The character is subject to premonitions and dreams of the past and future. Once per month, the character has a *prophetic dream* determined by the Judge.

###### Prospecting

The character is an expert at finding ore deposits who can assess 6-mile hexes to determine if they have any minable ore. Prospecting one 6-mile hex requires one day of dedicated activity and requires a successful proficiency throw of 18+. A character who also has the Land Surveying proficiency gains an additional +4 bonus to prospecting throws. Detailed rules for prospecting for ore are described in Chapter 8 of ***By This Axe***.

###### Quiet Magic

The character can cast spells with minimal words and gestures. The gestures, while subtler than those of ordinary casters, are still apparent if the character is in direct view of undistracted observers. The words, however, are hard to hear even in a quiet room; a successful proficiency throw to hear noise is required to hear the character cast spells. Full binding and gagging is necessary to prevent the character from working magic.

###### Reliquarianism

The character has learned the secret theurgy by which the craftpriests channel the faith of their people into the relics of their ancestors. The character can store divine power he accumulates from congregants or sacrifice in a reliquary. The reliquary must be located in the same 24-mile hex as the congregants. A character with this proficiency can access the divine power when performing magic research if he has personally visited the reliquary for at least one turn in the last month and is working in the vault where the reliquary is located. The maximum amount of divine power that can be stored is equal to the construction cost of the reliquary plus the gp value of the relic(s) stored within. If the reliquary is destroyed, or the relics within are removed, divine power in excess of the remaining value is irrecoverably lost. Because this proficiency manipulates divine power itself, it cannot be enchanted into items.

###### Revelry (G)

The character is a connoisseur of fairs, festivals, food, and drink. He can automatically identify popular performers, cantinas, inns, and taverns in his settlement of residence. His high alcohol tolerance grants him a +2 bonus to saving throws related to consumption of potions, dwarven brews, or ordinary beer, wine, and spirits. Ordinary 0th level NPCs who live routine lives often have this proficiency; it is less common among go-getting adventurers.

###### Riding (G)

The character is an expert equestrian. He can ride without a saddle, bit, or bridle in non-combat conditions. He can ride a saddled riding animal under combat conditions without penalty. He can force-march a saddled riding animal without becoming fatigued. (His riding animal still becomes fatigued, so to continue force marching he must change mounts). When he is saddled on a charging or running riding animal, he can guide the animal to jump up to 5’ upward over a distance of up to 25% of its combat movement in feet. If the character also has Mounted Combat, he can ride without a saddle, bit, or bridle in combat conditions without penalty.

###### Righteous Rebuke

When rebuking undead,the character adds his Will bonus to his rebuking throws and one-half his divine caster level (rounded up) to the number of HD of undead rebuked on a successful throw.

###### Running

The character’s base speed is increased by 30’ when wearing medium or lighter armor and carrying 7 stones or less encumbrance.

###### Seafaring (G)

If a character selects this proficiency once, he knows how to sail or row (his choice). If he also has Navigation proficiency, he can serve as a navigator on a seafaring vessel. If he selects the proficiency twice, he knows how to both sail and row, and can serve as a vessel captain. If he selects this proficiency three times, he is a master mariner. Master mariners can sail faster against the wind and gain a +4 bonus on Seafaring proficiency throws and ramming attacks.

###### Seduction (G)

The character is either naturally alluring or a practiced seducer. He receives a +1 bonus on reaction rolls when interacting with others who are potentially attracted to the character. This bonus stacks with Mystic Aura, but not with Diplomacy or Intimidation.

###### Sensing Evil

The character can detect creatures with evil intentions, magic items with evil enchantments, sinkholes of evil, enchanted creatures of Chaotic alignment, incarnations of Chaotic alignment, and undead within 45’. Normal characters, even if Chaotic, are not detected unless they have actively evil intentions against the character. Poisons, physical traps, and natural animals are neither good nor evil, so they are not detected by this spell. The character sees the evil creatures or objects with a sinister red glow around them, but the glow cannot be seen by anyone else. The character must have line of sight on the evil (i.e. the power does not work through walls). If the creature or object is hidden or invisible, the character will only see the glow and not the source of the evil. Sensing evil requires one full round of quiet concentration to activate. The effect lasts as long as the character continues to concentrate, to a maximum of one round per level. The effect can be used once per turn (10 minutes).

###### Sensing Good

The character can detect creatures with good intentions, magic items with good enchantments, pinnacles of good, enchanted creatures of Lawful alignment, and incarnations of Lawful alignment, within 30’. Normal characters are not detected unless they have actively good intentions towards the character. Delicious meals, comfy furniture, and natural animals are neither good nor evil, so they are not detected by this spell. The character sees the good creatures or objects with an annoying golden glow around them, but the glow cannot be seen by anyone else. The character must have line of sight on the good (i.e. the power does not work through walls). If the creature or object is hidden or invisible, the character will only see the glow and not the source of the good. Sensing good requires one full round of quiet concentration to activate. The effect lasts as long as the character continues to concentrate, to a maximum of one round per level. The effect can be used once per turn (10 minutes).

###### Sensing Power

The character can detect spellcasters within 45’ and estimate their level of power relative to his own. He can tell when magic has been used within the last 24 hours within the same vicinity and identify the spell signature of the effect. The character cannot necessarily sense whether an item is magic, unless it has been used in the last 24 hours. Sensing power requires one full round of quiet concentration to activate. The effect lasts as long as the character continues to concentrate, to a maximum of one round per level. The effect can be used once per turn (10 minutes).

###### Siege Engineering (G)

The character has been trained in the military art of siege engineering. With one rank in the proficiency, the character can construct defensive works such as ditches, pits, fields of stakes, and other simple wooden and earthen barricades with a construction rate of 2sp per day of dedicated activity. He can operate heavy war machines and siege engines such as ballistae, catapults, rams, bores, and siege towers as an artillerist. With two ranks in the proficiency, the character can construct defensive works, heavy war machines, siege engines, and siege towers with a construction rate of 6.6sp per day of dedicated activity. He can also supervise others working on siege engineering projects of up to 25,000gp construction cost.

###### Signaling (G)

The character knows how to transmit messages to other signaling specialists of the same military force, culture, trade guild, or other organization. This is similar to learning an additional language. The character must specify the style and culture of signals that he has learned when he takes this proficiency. Examples of signals include naval flags, cavalry trumpets, or smoke signals.

###### Skirmishing

The character can withdraw or retreat from melee combat without declaring the intention to do so at the start of the melee round. (Characters without this proficiency must declare defensive movement before initiative dice are rolled. See **Defensive Movement** in Chapter 6.) He does not suffer a penalty to armor class when charging or running when wearing medium or lighter armor and carrying 7 stones or less encumbrance.

###### Skulking

The character excels at moving furtively and finding concealment. He gains a +2 bonus on Hiding and Sneaking proficiency throws. When sneaking at more than one-half combat speed, his penalty is reduced to -2 (instead of -5). When sneaking while running, his penalty is reduced to -5 (instead of -10).

###### Sniping

If otherwise eligible to ambush or backstab his opponent, the character can do so using missile weapons at up to long range. Characters without this proficiency can only ambush or backstab in melee or with missile weapons at short range.

###### Soothsaying

The character has been trained to read the omens in everyday things — the throw of dice, the flight of birds, or the leaves of tea. Once every 8 hours, he can cast **augury** (as the spell). The casting time is 10 seconds (1 round).

###### Streetwise (G)

The character has learned the hard lessons taught by life as a criminal. He can begin play as a member of a thieves’ guild or other criminal syndicate (Judge’s discretion). He can engage in hijinks if he has the necessary proficiencies. He can automatically identify gestures, signs, slang, and territory of criminal organizations in his home settlement. He can identify those of other urban settlements with a proficiency throw of 11+. Secret organizations or organizations in far-off cities can be harder to recognize. A character can select this proficiency additional times.

###### Survival (G)

The character is an expert at hunting small game, gathering fruits and vegetables, and finding water and shelter. He can forage enough food to feed himself automatically, even when on the move. If trying to forage to feed additional characters, or to find water, he must make a proficiency throw (as described in **Wilderness Adventures** on p. XX), but gains a +4 bonus on the roll.

###### Swashbuckling

If the character is wearing light armor or no armor, and carrying 5 stones or less encumbrance, he gains a +1 bonus to Armor Class. At level 7, this bonus increases to +2, and at level 13 the bonus increases to +3. Swashbuckling proficiency can be stacked with the bladedancer’s Graceful Fighting class power to increase the AC bonus, but the bonus from Swashbuckling is capped at +1 unless the bladedancer is unarmored.

###### Swimming (G)

The character is a proficient swimmer. He gains a +4 bonus when making Swimming proficiency throws. If this bonus would improve his Swimming throw to 0+ or better, he need not make a Swimming throw at all.

###### Syncretism

The character has integrated knowledge from other religions into his own divine practice. He can replace 4 divine spells in his repertoire with a selection of other divine spells not normally available to worshippers of his god. A character who selects this proficiency does not innately violate his divine code of behavior, but may face repercussions within his order if it becomes known he does not follow orthodox doctrine (Judge’s discretion).

###### Theology (G)

The character has received religious instruction at a seminary, monastery, or temple. If he is a divine spellcaster, he can begin play as a member of a religious hierarchy (Judge’s discretion). He can acquire congregants through proselytizing. He can automatically identify religious symbols, spell signatures, trappings, and holy days of his own faith, and can recognize those of other faiths with a proficiency throw of 11+. Rare or occult cults can be harder to recognize. This proficiency can be selected multiple times.

###### Tracking (G)

The character can search for tracks left behind by passing creatures. It requires one turn (10 minutes) to search for tracks in the vicinity of an encounter. If the throw fails, the character cannot try again in that area until at least 6 turns (one hour) has passed. Searching for tracks requires a Tracking proficiency throw of 11+. The Judge should increase or decrease the chance of success depending on the circumstances:

* +2 if tracking 2 – 4 creatures
* +4 if tracking 4 – 8 creatures
* +6 if tracking 8 – 16 creatures
* +8 if tracking 17+ creatures
* +4 if trail is through soft/muddy ground
* -8 if the trail is through hard/rocky ground
* -1 per 12 hours of good weather since trail was made
* -4 per hour of rain/snow since trail was made
* -4 if dim lighting (torch, moonlight, etc)

Once tracks are discovered, the character can begin following them, moving at half exploration speed in dungeons and half expedition speed in wilderness. Following tracks does not require a proficiency throw. However, if the tracks enter water or if one hour of Rainy/Snowy conditions elapses, the tracks are lost and the character must search again to find them.

If any member of a party has the Tracking proficiency, the party receives a +4 bonus on the proficiency throw when searching for lairs in a 6-mile hex. This proficiency can be selected multiple times. Each additional rank improves the proficiency throw to track by 4; however, it does not increase the bonus when searching for lairs.

###### Transmogrification

The character has mastered grotesque arts of transformation. When the character casts transmogrification spells, the spell effects are calculated as if he were two class levels higher than his actual level of experience. His eligibility to create crossbreeds or research transmogrification magic is determined as if he were two caster levels higher than actual. Targets of his transmogrification spells suffer a -2 penalty to their saving throw. He gains a +2 bonus on magic research throws and increases his research rate by 10% when creating crossbreeds or researching transmogrification magic. See **Crossbreeding** (p. XX) for more details. Transmogrification can stack with the Grotesque Arts of Transformation class power such that the character’s transmogrification spells are calculated as if he were three (rather than two) caster levels higher and his bonus to magic research and research rate is increased to +3 and 15%.

###### Trapfinding

The character is an expert at searching for traps and disarming them. He gains a +2 bonus on Searching and Trapbreaking proficiency throws. He triggers undetected traps only one-half as often as other adventurers (1 on 1d6 instead of 1-2).

###### Trapping (G)

The character is an expert with wilderness traps such as deadfalls, earthen pits, spring snares, and whipping branches capable of capturing creatures up to the size of an elephant (such as giants, ogres, wyverns, etc.). He can find and remove wilderness traps as a thief of one-half his class level (rounded up). (If already proficient in Searching or Trapfinding, he gains an additional +2 bonus against wilderness traps.) He can craft ordinary or crude wilderness traps with a construction rate of 1sp per hour.

Crude traps cost 10% the cost of permanent traps (see Chapter 4, p. XX, for a list of trap costs). They function similarly to permanent traps, but are easier to spot and less effective. All characters gain a +4 bonus to find and remove crude traps. If a crude trap triggers an attack, it attacks with a -2 penalty. If a crude trap grants a saving throw, the target saves with a +2 bonus. Once set, a crude trap must be maintained, which entails checking it for finds, performing minor repairs, and resetting its lures. Each trap requires 1sp (one hour’s worth) of maintenance per day from a trapper and if unmaintained it ceases functioning.

Wilderness traps can catch game. Each day, the Judge makes a proficiency throw of 1d20 against a target value of 19+. A successful result indicates that the trap has yielded sufficient food for 1d6 man-sized creatures per 1sp value of the trap. If the proficiency throw fails with an unmodified 1, a crude trap breaks completely. For every eight traps being managed, the Judge should make an encounter throw to see if a wandering monster appropriate for the terrain is in the area. The monster will stumble into the trap on a throw of 1-2 on 1d6; otherwise it will be lurking nearby when traps are checked.

Trapping also enables the character to properly harvest monster horns, tusks, and antlers; to skin, flesh, and butcher creatures for pelts and meats; and to extract special components from animals. The proficiency provides no abilities with regard to mechanical traps in a dungeon or with magical traps of any sort.

###### Unarmed Fighting

The character is an expert in striking with fist and feet. When brawling(see **Brawling** in Chapter 6), he can deal lethal damage. He can damage characters in metal armor with Brawling without himself taking damage.

###### Unflappable Casting

When the character loses a spell by being interrupted or taking damage during the round, he does not lose his action for the round. While he still loses the spell, he can now move and attack normally. Characters without this proficiency lose the opportunity to act at all if they are interrupted while casting a spell. See **Casting Spells** in Chapter 5 and Chapter 6.

###### Vermin-Slaying

The character specializes in exterminating the insects, slimes, and swarms that plague the underdark. With a proficiency throw of 11+, he can identify the abilities and vulnerabilities of oozes and vermin based on their physical appearance. He receives a +1 bonus to hit oozes and vermin and a +1 bonus to saving throws against special attacks by oozes and vermin such as a carrion horror’s paralyzing stinger or mustard mold’s spores. (The pest control community in the Auran Empire considers oozes a type of vermin even though monstrologists disagree.)

###### Wakefulness

The character rests by calmly meditating rather than sleeping. He is immune to magical **sleep**. He can keep watch while meditating without penalty, allowing party members to rest.

###### Weapon Finesse

When attacking with tiny, small, or medium melee weapons, the character can use his Dexterity modifier instead of his Strength modifier on his attack throw.

###### Weapon Focus

When using a favored type of weapon, the character is capable of devastating strikes. On an attack throw scoring an unmodified 20 when using his favored weapon, the character inflicts an additional die of damage (by weapon type). A character can take this proficiency multiple times, selecting an additional Weapon Focus each time. The available Weapon Focuses are: axes; maces, flails and hammers; swords and daggers; bows and crossbows; slings and thrown weapons; spears and polearms. Weapon Focus does not allow a character to use weapons not available to his class.

# Chapter 4: Equipment

## The Basics of Equipment

Adventurers need weapons, armor, equipment, mounts, vehicles, or hirelings. If your campaign is using templates, each adventurer will already have his starting assets. If not, the player should roll 3d6 x 10 to determine his adventurer’s starting gold pieces.

Each character should purchase equipment suitable for their class. For example, fighters should purchase arms and armor to fight monsters and survive blows, while thieves need rope, crowbars, thieves’ tools, and other equipment to scale obstacles, find traps, and open locks. Crusaders will require holy symbols to drive back undead and mages will need spellbooks to record their dweomers.

## Coins and Money

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | **Exchange Value** | | |
| **Coins** | **Cp** | **Sp** | **Ep** | | **Gp** | **Pp** |
| Copper Piece (cp) = | 1 | 1/10 | 1/50 | | 1/100 | 1/500 |
| Silver Piece (sp) = | 10 | 1 | 1/5 | | 1/10 | 1/50 |
| Electrum Piece (ep) = | 50 | 5 | 1 | | 1/2 | 1/10 |
| Gold Piece (gp) = | 100 | 10 | 2 | | 1 | 1/5 |
| Platinum Piece (pp) = | 500 | 50 | 10 | | 5 | 1 |

Equipment is purchased using money. Paper currency is non-existent in the world of the Auran Empire*,* so money takes the form of coins of precious metal. The copper piece is the most widely-used coin. A copper piece (cp) purchases a loaf of bread or three pints of cheap ale. 10cp make a silver piece (sp). 10sp or 100cp make a gold piece (gp). These three coins are the most widely used in the civilized world. Less commonly seen are electrum pieces (ep), each worth 5sp, and platinum pieces (pp), each worth 5gp.

###### What’s a Gold Piece Worth?

To put the value of currency in perspective, the Standard of Living table, below, shows how far a gold piece will go towards cost of living at different standards of comfort. A single gold piece is enough for a peasant to subsist at a wretched quality of life. Early in their career, adventurers will typically live on a few dozen gold pieces per month, enough to eat and sleep at an inn. A dragon’s treasure hoard of 50,000gp might keep a village of peasants alive for decade, but merely cover a prince’s monthly budget. Wealth is assumed to be highly concentrated in ***ACKS***campaign worlds.

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Standard of Living** | **Monthly Cost** | **Common Professions** |
| Wretched | 1gp – 3gp | Indentured servants, serfs, and unskilled laborers |
| Meager | 3gp – 12gp | Skilled laborers and apprentice artisans |
| Adequate | 12gp – 40gp | Journeyman artisans, 1st level adventurers |
| Comfortable | 40gp – 100gp | Master artisans or yeomen farmers (85 acres), 2nd level adventurers |
| Prosperous | 100gp – 450gp | Master professionals or landed patrician (200 acres), 3rd – 4th level adventurers |
| Affluent | 450gp – 2,000gp | Barons or wealthy patricians, 5th – 7th level adventurers |
| Sumptuous | 2,000 – 12,000gp | Viscounts or counts, 8th – 9th level adventurers |
| Luxurious | 12,000 – 80,000gp | Dukes or princes, 10th – 12th level adventurers |
| Lavishly Opulent | 80,000gp+ | Kings or emperors, 13th – 14th level adventurers |

## Purchasing Equipment

The arms, armor, and mundane gear available for purchase are listed from the **Equipment List** tables. The equipment and other items listed on the Equipment List tables are described in detail in the **Equipment Descriptions** section.

Should the players wish to purchase items not provided in the equipment lists, the Judge can use the items available as guidelines for determining new items’ characteristics and prices.

All purchases should be recorded on the character sheet, noting how much money remains afterward. Most adventurers do not begin play with enough wealth to get everything they want — indeed, the quest for wealth is one of the primary motives for adventuring at all!

###### Equipment Availability

Adventurers might sometimes wish to purchase equipment in greater volume than the town they are in can handle. This is not normally a concern when characters are just beginning their career. But if experienced adventurers decide they want to use a dragon’s hoard to equip all their followers with fur cloaks (15gp each) and purchase a dozen heavy warhorses (750gp each) with plate barding (600gp each), they may find such goods are simply unavailable in the quantities they desire!

The amount of equipment available for purchase is determined by the price of the equipment relative to the size of the **market** the adventurers are in. A market can be anything from a village’s humble fair to a city-state’s outdoor bazaar to the ports of a major metropolis. Markets are rated by **market class** from I to VI, which rate their size and importance. The vast mercantile hubs of empires, with urban populations of 100,000 or more, constitute Class I. Major ports, national capitals, and other large cities of 25,000 or more inhabitants constitute Class II. Provincial capitals and medium-sized cities of 8,750 to 25,000 inhabitants make up Class III. Small cities and large towns of 3,000 to 8,750 inhabitants make up Class IV. Small towns and large villages of 1,250 to 3,000 inhabitants are Class V. A village of 1,250 inhabitants or less is Class VI. Market classes are also important for hiring henchmen, as discussed in the **Hirelings**, **Henchmen**, **Mercenaries**, **and Specialists** section below, and for trade and commerce, asdiscussed in the **Mercantile Ventures** section in the **Campaigns** chapter.

The **Equipment Availability by Market Class** table shows how many units of any piece of equipment are available in each type of market each month. Some values will indicate a percentage chance; this is chance of one unit being present at all in any given month. The values given are the number of each specific item, not the total number of items at that price level. For instance, a Class IV market will have 10 swords, 10 battle axes, and 10 of each other item priced at 2-10gp. Multiple small items sold as a bundle (such as 6 spikes, 6 torches, 20 arrows, etc) count as one item for purposes of the Equipment Availability by Market Class table. The values are per party, representing those merchants who they know and transact with. Very large parties (12 or more adventurers) who devote a dedicated activity to shopping can purchase twice as much. (If the campaign involves multiple parties of adventurers, the maximum monthly number of items available across all parties is ten times the value shown.)

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Equipment Availability by Market Class** | | | | | | |
| **Price** | **Class I** | **Class II** | **Class III** | **Class IV** | **Class V** | **Class VI** |
| 1gp or less | 2,750 | 700 | 425 | 100 | 35 | 15 |
| 2gp – 10gp | 300 | 70 | 35 | 10 | 3 | 1 |
| 11 – 100gp | 20 | 5 | 2 | 1 | 25% | 10% |
| 101 – 1,000gp | 7 | 2 | 1 | 25% | 10% | 5% |
| 1,001 – 10,000gp | 2 | 1 | 25% | 10% | 5% | 1% |
| 10,001gp or more | 25% | 10% | 3% | 1% | NA | NA |

EXAMPLE: Marcus is in Cyfaraun, a Class III market. He wants to buy a war galley (60,000gp), medium warhorse (250gp), 2 suits of plate armor (60gp each), 50 swords (10gp each), and 200 flasks of common oil (3sp each). A Class III market has 425 units of any equipment priced 1gp or less, so he can buy the 200 flasks of oil. A Class III market has only 35 units of equipment priced 10gp or less, so only 35 swords are available. Since he needs weapons, he settles on 35 swords and 15 battle axes. A Class III market has 2 units of equipment priced at 11 – 100gp and 1 unit at 101 – 1,000gp, so he can buy the 2 suits of plate armor and medium warhorse. There is only a 3% chance of a war galley being available, and the Judge rolls a 42; Marcus cannot find that type of ship in Cyfaraun this month.

Adventurers can sell equipment in good condition in the market subject to the same limits of market availability that apply to purchase. Sales of equipment beyond those limits requires mercantile activity (p. XX). Scavenged or otherwise poor-quality equipment will sell for a lower price (p. XX).

###### Importing Equipment

If equipment the adventurers desire to purchase is not available, they can pay a merchant to import it for them from a larger market, either a local hub (+1 market class) or a regional hub (+2 market class). The advantage of importing equipment is that more equipment is available. The number of items that can be imported is determined by the size of the market from which the items will be imported. The disadvantage of importing equipment is that it is not immediately available. Imports arrive from a local hub after 2d6 days and from a regional hub after 2d6 weeks. On a roll of 12, the items are lost or stolen in transit and never show up. Adventurers can also commission construction projects for items (p. XX).

**Type** determines which weapon proficiencies and fighting styles are required to use the weapon. Note that small melee weapons are those wielded with just one hand, medium melee weapons are those wielded with either one or two hands, and large melee weapons are those requiring two hands to wield. Missile weapons are wielded with two hands unless Handy or Thrown (q.v.). **Damage** is the number of hit points a target loses when successfully attacked by the weapon. Damage can be modified by attributes, class powers, magic, and proficiencies.

**Encumbrance** is the weight of the weapon. 1 stone is approximately 10 – 15 lbs. Most small and medium weapons weigh 1/6 stone while most large weapons weigh 1 stone. **Short/Medium/Long** indicates the distance (in feet) that the weapon can be fired at short, medium, and long range. Attacks at medium range suffer a -2 penalty while attacks at long range suffer a -5 penalty. **Cost** is the price of a clean, well-made weapon in an urban settlement. Rusty, shoddy weapons can sometimes be purchased for less, but have worse characteristics (Judge’s discretion). **Special** calls out any peculiar features of the weapon. The special features include:

* *Cleave:* The weapon is limited in the number of cleaves it can perform in a round. The limit is listed after the Cleave tag.
* *Entangling:* The weapon grants a +2 bonus to attack throws when used to make a knockdown or wrestling special maneuver.
* *Flexible:* The weapon grants a +2 bonus to attack throws when used to make a disarm or knockdown special maneuver.
* *Handy:* The missile weapon only requires one hand, enabling it to be used with a shield. If a missile weapon is both slow and handy, it can only be used with a shield while the combatant is dismounted and stationary.
* *Impact:* The weapon deals an additional die of impact damage when used in or against a charge. Impact damage is of the same type as the weapon ordinarily delivers.
* *Incapacitating:* The weapon grants a +2 bonus to attack throws when used to make an incapacitation special maneuver.
* *Long:* The weapon can be used to attack targets from the second rank that are **engaged** with an ally in the front rank. However, any attack throw of a natural 1 made with the weapon breaks its shaft. It costs 1gp to repair the break. Until repaired, the weapon can be used as an off-balance (-1 to attacks throw) dagger and/or staff.
* *Mounted:* The weapon only requires one hand if the character is mounted.
* *Silver:* The weapon’s blade has been coated in silver. Silver versions of other common weapons can be found or commissioned for 10x the listed price of the weapon. Apart from gaining the Silver feature, the weapon’s characteristics do not change.
* *Slow:* The weapon cannot be fired on consecutive combat rounds unless the character remains stationary or is mounted.
* *Thrown:* The weapon can be thrown as a missile.

**Type** determines which armor proficiencies or fighting styles are required. **AC** indicates the armor class granted. **Encumbrance** is the weight of the armor. **Cost** is the price of a clean, well-made item in an urban settlement. Rusty, shoddy armor can sometimes be purchased for less, but have worse characteristics (Judge’s discretion). **Special** calls out any peculiar features of the armor, including:

* *Enclosing:* Wearing the item imposes a -1 penalty to surprise rolls and -4 penalty to proficiency throws to hear noise, but grants a +2 bonus on d20 rolls made on the Mortal Wounds table.
* *Revealing:* Characters with clean-limbed bodies (STR, DEX, CON, and CHA all 11+) gain a +1 bonus to Seduction reaction rolls when wearing the armor. Why they do not gain this bonus while naked or in revealing clothes of an ordinary sort is still being researched by the sages of the Tower of Knowledge.
* *Scarce:* Scarce armors are generally available at only one-half the usual volume noted in the Equipment Availability by Market Class table. However, scarce armor is available at full volume at markets in dwarven settlements.
* *Spiked:* Barding with spikes adds +1 damage per die to the animal’s bite, claw, hoof, tail, tusk, or trample attacks.

**AC** is the armor class of the weapon itself. **SHP** is the structural hit points of the weapon. **Weight** is the weight of the weapon. For trebuchets, the weight includes the counterweight (ballast). **Ammo Weight** is the weight of the ammunition fired by the weapon. Artillery is most effective when firing ammunition of the designated weight. Artillery can fire ammunition of a lighter or heavier weight than indicated for their type, but reduce maximum range by 25%. Artillery firing crude shot suffers a -2 penalty to attack throws. **Range** shows the minimum and maximum range of the weapon. **Damage** indicates the damage dealt by the artillery to creatures within its area of effect. **Structure Damage** is a multiplier applied to the base damage of the artillery vs. wooden and stone structures. **Crew** and **Rate of Fire** show the variable crew that can be used with the consequent rate of fire. Artillery crews without an artillerist specialist reduce their rate of fire by half and attack at -4. See Missile Attacks with Artillery (p. XX).

## Equipment Descriptions

###### Weapon Descriptions

All daggers and swords come with a simple sheath or scabbard. All other melee weapons come with a strap that can be hung from an adventurer’s harness, belt, or shoulder strap. Decorative scabbards can be purchased separately as adventuring equipment.

**Arbalest:** An arbalest is a heavy crossbow, pulled with the mechanical assistance of a rack and pinion or windlass. Historical examples include the late medieval arbalest and the Three Kingdoms era Chinese heavy crossbow. In Aurëpos, only dwarves manufacture arbalests in wide numbers, though all races and realms buy and use them.

**Axe, Battle:** This is a single- or double-bitted axe with a 24” to 48” haft, designed for battle and useable with one or two hands. Historical examples include the Scythian sagaris, Viking bearded and skeg axe, Celtic war axe, medieval battle axe, and Persian tabarzin. In Aurëpos, battle axes are popular with Jutlandic dwarves and humans and Meniri dwarves, as well as with beastmen.

**Axe, Great:** This is a double-bitted axe or long-shafted single-bitted axe, with a 48” or longer haft, requiring two hands to use. Historical examples included the Greek double-bitted labrys, Viking long bearded axe, and the English longaxe. In Aurëpos, great axes are popular with Jutlandic dwarves and humans and Meniri dwarves.

**Axe, Hand:** This is a single-bitted axe, with a 12” to 24” haft, balanced for throwing. Historical examples include the Frankish francisca, American tomahawk, and African mambele and kasuyu. In Aurëpos hand axes are popular with the Jutlanders (both dwarves and humans), the Meniri dwarves, and the various races of beastmen. They are favored by explorers throughout the continent because they can serve as tools as well as weapons.

**Bola:** These are throwing weapons made of weights on the ends of interconnected cords, designed to capture animals by entangling their legs. A character can use a bola to make a knock down or wrestling maneuver (as described in **Special Maneuvers**, p. XX) with a thrown attack. In Aurëpos, bolas are popular with the elves of Northern Argollë and the tribes of the Ivory Kingdoms.

**Bow, Composite:** A composite bow is a recurved bow made of laminated wood, horn, and sinew. Composite bows are time consuming and expensive to craft but offer a better combination of mobility and power than long bows or short bows. Historical examples include the Scythian horn bow, Chinese laminated bamboo bow, Greek and Roman composite bow, Mongolian composite bow, and Japanese yumi. Composite bows are popular throughout Aurëpos, but especially among the Kryseans, Northern Argollëans, and Skysos.

**Bow, Long:** A long bow is made from a single piece of wood, as tall as the person who uses it. Equal in range and power to more expensive composite bows, long bows require substantial strength (STR 9 or more) and cannot be used by mounted troops. Historical examples include the ancient Indian long bow, the Nubian long bow, and the Welsh and English long bow. In Aurëpos, long bows are popular in Northern Argollë, Southern Argollë, Rorn, Somirea, and the Ivory Kingdoms.

**Bow, Short:** A short bow is made from a single piece of wood, usually around 4’ tall. Short bows lack the range and power of either long bows or composite bows, but are cheap and fast to make. Historical examples include the Neolithic short bow and Comanche self bow. Short bows are popular among every race and realm in Aurëpos.

**Cestus:** A pair of armored battle gloves, made with leather strips and fitted with blades, spikes, and/or iron plates. Characters equipped with cestus may deal 1d3 points of lethal damage with a punch. In the Auran Empire, cestuses are used in gladiatorial contests.

**Club:** A club is any simple bludgeon used to batter opponents.

**Crossbow:** A crossbow is a bow mounted cross-wise on a stock with a trigger. It fires squat projectiles called bolts. Crossbows are light enough to pull by hand or with a quick drawing lever and are much easier to use than bows. Historical examples are the Greek gastraphetes, Roman arcuballista, Chinese handheld crossbow, and the medieval crossbow with cavalry cranequin. In Aurëpos, the best crossbows are of dwarvish make, although the Celdoreans, Niceans, and Tireneans also manufacture and use them. They are rare in Jutland and Rorn.

**Dagger:** A dagger has a small 6” to 12” blade, either single-edged for cutting, or doubled edged for stabbing. Daggers may be used in melee or for throwing. Historical examples include the Asian kris, medieval poniard, Japanese tanto, Scottish dirk, and Renaissance stiletto. Some daggers have blades coated with silver for use against enchanted creatures. Daggers are popular among every race and realm in Aurëpos.

**Dart:** A dart is any small projectile designed to be thrown. Most darts are fletched wooden shafts, ranging in length from 6” to 2’ long, but they may also be metal spikes or stars. Historical examples include the Roman plumbata, Macedonian kestros, and Japanese shuriken. In Aurëpos, darts are common in Krysea, Tirenea, and the Ivory Kingdoms.

**Flail:** This is a bludgeoning weapon derived from the agricultural flail with a striking head connected to the haft by a flexible chain. Flails are useable with one or two hands. Historical examples include the medieval ball-and-chain, Japanese rentsuru and nunchaku, and Chinese meteor hammer. Flails were highly favored among the old Zaharan nobility and remain popular in Celdorea, Kemesh, and Somirea.

**Javelin:** Javelins are short spears, 3’ to 6’ long, designed for throwing. Historical examples include the Greek javelin, Roman pilum and verutum, early medieval angon, and Zulu assegai. Javelins are popular among every race and realm of Aurëpos.

**Lance:** Lances are long spears, 12’ to 16’ in length, designed for mounted warriors. Despite their length, they can be used one-handed if mounted. If used on foot with two hands, a lance can be used to attack targets from behind an ally. Lances inflict double damage when used in or against a charge. However, any attack throw of natural 1 made with a lance breaks its shaft. Historical examples include the Greek xyston, Persian and Byzantine kontos, and medieval lance. Lances are used by cavalry throughout Aurëpos.

**Mace:** A mace is a bludgeoning weapon consisting of a 2’ to 3’ wood or metal shaft and a heavy stone or metal head, useable with one or two hands. Historical examples include the Egyptian bronze-headed mace, medieval flanged mace, Persian horseman’s mace, Russian pernach, and Slavic bulawa. In the Auran Empire, maces are popular among the crusaders and paladins of Ammonar.

**Morning Star:** This is any type of large mace-liked weapon with a spiked metal head. Any flails and maces too large to be used one-handed can also be treated as morning stars. Historical examples include the medieval morning star, German chain-morning star, English holy water sprinkler, Flemish goedendag, and Japanese tetsubo. Like flails, morning stars were popular in ancient Zahar and remain so in its successor states.

**Net:** This is a round, weighted cast net designed to entangle and entrap opponents. The chief historical example is the net of the Roman retiarius. A character using a net gets a +2 bonus on attack throws to wrestle or knockdown opponents (see **Special Maneuvers**, p. XX). In the Auran Empire, nets are often used in gladiatorial arenas. They are also popular in Northern Argollë and the Ivory Kingdoms.

**Polearm:** Polearms are two-handed slashing and piercing weapons with a metal head and a long wooden shaft. Polearms range in length from 6’ to 21’. Polearms can be used to attack from the second rank in melee, and inflict double damage when used in or against a charge. However, any attack throw of natural 1 made with a polearm breaks its shaft. Historical examples include the Thracian rhomphaia, Dacian falx, and Macedonian sarissa; the medieval bill, fauchard, glaive, guisarme, halberd, partisan, pike, ranseur, spetum, and voulge; the Chinese gun dao; and the Japanese bisento, nagamaki, and naginata.

**Sap:** A sap consists of a heavyweight material wrapped inside a leather sack. Used as a weapon, it provides a +2 bonus to attack throws made to incapacitate opponents (as described in **Special Maneuvers**, p. xx). Saps are only common among criminal sorts.

**Sling:** A sling is a projectile weapon, made of braided flax, hemp or wool cord, used to hurl small stones or lead bullets. Sling ammunition costs nothing and weighs 1/6 st. per 30 shots. Slings were used by all armies of the ancient world. Historical examples include the Hebrew shepherd’s sling and Greek peltast’s sling. Slings are popular among all races and realms in Aurëpos.

**Spear:** Wooden shafts, 6’ to 8’ in length, with metal heads designed for thrusting, spears are the main weapon of the common soldier. Spears can be used one- or two-handed. Characters armed with spears can attack from behind an ally and inflict double damage when used in or against a charge. However, any attack throw of natural 1 made with a spear breaks its shaft. Historical examples include the Hoplite doru, the medieval winged spear, and the Japanese yari. Spears are, by far, the most common weapon in the Auran Empire, used by every race and realm.

**Staff:** A staff is a common weapon made from a stick of hardwood 4’ to 6’ long, and used two-handed. (A one-handed staff is a club.) Historical examples include the English quarterstaff, Japanese bo stick, and Chinese gun. Staffs are widely popular in Aurëpos.

**Staff-Sling:** A staff-sling is nothing more than a sling attached to a staff. Like staffs, and unlike slings, staff-slings require two hands to use. A staff-sling can be used to hurl burning oil at longer range than it can be thrown, but the chance of a botch is increased to 1-3 on 1d20. A staff-sling can be used in melee as a staff, but if the wielder rolls an unmodified 1 on his attack throw, the sling breaks off from the staff. The chief historical example is the Roman fustibalus. Staff-slings are used throughout Aurëpos.

**Sword:** The classic weapon of knights and kings, the sword includes straight and curved slashing and thrusting blades of 30” to 40” in length useable with one or two hands. Historical examples include the Roman spatha, Viking sword, medieval knightly sword and falchion, Japanese katana, and Chinese jian and dao. Swords are popular throughout the military and noble classes of the continent, as well as among Jutlandic huscarls and Rornish knights.

**Sword, Short:** The short sword includes straight and curved slashing and thrusting blades, generally less than 30” in length, meant to be used with one hand. Historical examples include the Egyptian khopesh, Greek xiphos, Roman gladius, Japanese wakizashi, Arab scimitar, Persian shamshir, Turkish yatagan, and Indian talwar. After the spear, short swords are the most common infantry weapon in Aurëpos. Curved short swords are a common cavalry weapon in the Sunset Kingdoms.

**Sword, Two-Handed:** The two-handed sword includes straight and curved slashing and thrusting blades, 40” or more in length, requiring two hands to use effectively. Historical examples include the medieval longsword, the Renaissance zweihänder, Scottish claymore, Japanese no-dachi, and Chinese zhanmadao. Two-handed swords were favored by the ruinguards of ancient Zahar, but are not widely seen nowadays, except among the Jutlandic barbarians.

**Warhammer:** A warhammer is a bludgeoning weapon with a 2’ to 3’ wooden or metal shaft and a broad metal head shaped like a hammer. It is designed for crushing armor. The chief historical example is the late medieval warhammer, while the chief fantasy examples is Thor’s warhammer. In the Auran Empire, Warhammers are popular with crusaders of Türas and with dwarven vaultguards.

**Whip:** This is a long, single-tailed whip of the sort used to herd cattle. Used as a weapon, it grants +2 bonus to attack throws made to disarm or knock down opponents (see Special Maneuvers on p. XX). Whips are common throughout Aurëpos.

###### Armor and Barding Descriptions

Donning and removing armor is a time-consuming process that requires one round per stone of encumbrance. A character gains or loses +1 AC per stone of encumbrance until the armor is on or off. A character can, if desired, wear only parts of his armor, reducing encumbrance and/or avoiding penalties from sweltering weather at the cost of AC. Magic armor only provides its bonus when fully donned.

Armor (other than barding) is generally sized for man-sized creatures. Armor for small creatures does not cost any less than for man-sized creature, because of the technical complexity of working in miniature, but it weighs less. Armor for large creatures both costs and weighs more. Multiple the armor’s encumbrance and/or cost by the creature’s normal load / 5.

EXAMPLE: Halflings are small creatures with normal loads of 3 stone. Halfling-sized plate armor has a reduced encumbrance of (6 x 3/5) 3.6 stone, or 3 4/6 stone. Despite requiring less metal, the plate armor still costs 60gp, however. (A joke about the cost of children’s clothes would surely insult our halfling readership and thus has been edited out of this rulebook.)

**Arena Armor, Heavy:** A set of stylized heavy armor designed to expose the wearer’s attractive form and musculature while fighting. Depending on the wearer’s taste and style, heavy arena armor can include form-fitting leather, scale, or lamellar; sections of mail; and/or solitary pieces of plate on limbs and vital areas. Historical examples of heavy arena armor include that of the hoplomachus, provocator, and thraex types. Fantasy examples might include Morgana’s metal corset in Excalibur, Alia’s hauberk in Azure Bonds, and most of the armor seen in Xena: Warrior Princess. Heavy arena armor can also be used to simulate partial sets of heavier armor.

**Arena Armor, Light:** A set of stylized light armor designed to expose the wearer’s attractive form and musculature while fighting. Depending on the wearer’s taste and style, light arena armor can include form-fitting cloth or leather; thin straps of mail; and/or solitary pieces of plate on the limbs. Historical examples of light arena armor include that of the dimachaerus, myrmillo, retiarius, and secutor types. Fantasy examples might include Red Sonja’s chain mail bikini, He-Man’s battle harness, and most of the armor drawn by Frank Frazetta or Luis Royo. Light arena armor can also be used to simulate very partial sets of armor.

**Banded Plate Armor:** Banded plate armor is made of over-lapping 1mm-thick horizontal strips of laminated metal sewn over leather. It is comparable in protection to lamellar armor, and superior to chain mail. Banded plate is commonly worn as a cuirass with shoulder protection, with reinforced leather protecting the arms and legs. The chief historical examples are Sumerian overlapping plate armor and Roman lorica segmentata.

**Barding:** Barding is armor for non-humanoid creatures. It is made from a variety of materials (see the descriptions of each type of armor for details). Historical examples include Byzantine and Persian cataphract’s barding and medieval destrier’s barding. Most barding is sized for large animals such as war camels or horses. However, barding can be constructed for smaller or bigger creatures.

* Man-sized barding fits man-sized creatures such as war dogs. It costs and weighs 2/3 the weight of large barding.
* Huge barding fits huge creatures such as wyverns. It costs and weighs 3 times more than horse barding of the same type.
* Gigantic barding fits creatures such as war elephants. It costs and weighs 12 times more than horse barding of the same type.
* Colossal barding is armor sized to fit creatures such as ancient dragons and giant rocs. It costs and weighs 60 times more than horse barding of the same type.

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Barding | Colossal Creature | | Gigantic Creature | | Huge Creature | | Large Creature | | Man-Sized Creature | |
| Material | **Cost** | **Enc** | **Cost** | **Enc** | **Cost** | **Enc** | **Cost** | **Enc** | **Cost** | **Enc** |
| Leather | 2,400gp | 90 st | 480gp | 18 st | 120gp | 4 3/6 st | 40gp | 1 3/6 st | 25gp | 1 st |
| Scale | 4,500gp | 180 st | 900gp | 36 st | 225gp | 9 st | 75gp | 3 st | 50gp | 2 st |
| Chain | 9,000gp | 270 st | 1,800gp | 54 st | 450gp | 13 3/6 st | 150gp | 4 3/6 st | 100gp | 3 st |
| Lamellar | 18,000gp | 360 st | 3,600gp | 72 st | 900gp | 18 st | 300gp | 6 st | 200gp | 4 st |
| Plate | 36,000gp | 450 st | 7,200gp | 90 st | 1,800gp | 22 3/6 st | 600gp | 7 3/6 st | 400gp | 5 st |

**Barding, Half:** Half-barding only covers the front half of the mount. Half-barding costs and weighs half as much as full barding. However, the AC bonus from half-barding is lost if the creature (or its unit) is **flanked** or **vulnerable**. Half-barding is favored by cavalry that need protection from archery while still staying light.

**Barding, Spiked:** Spiked barding costs 50% more than standard barding of the same type. It adds +1 damage per die to the animal’s bite, claw, hoof, tail, tusk, or trample attacks. Historical examples include the wolf collars used on dogs and the tusk swords used on elephants.

**Chain Mail Armor:** Chain mail is made of small metal rings linked together in a pattern to form a 1mm-thick mesh. Chain mail is superior in protection to leather-based armors but inferior to metal scale or plate-reinforced armors. Chain mail is commonly worn as a shirt and coif, with lighter chain, ring mail, or hardened leather protecting the arms and legs and quilted padding below. Historical examples include Viking byrnies, Norman mail, and Roman lorica hamata.

**Helmet, Heavy:** This is a metal close-faced or visored helmet that completely covers the face, head, and neck. A heavy helmet must be purchased separately from a suit of armor. Wearing a heavy helm imposes a -1 penalty to surprise rolls and -4 penalty to Listening proficiency throws to hear noise, but offers a +2 bonus on d20 rolls made on the Mortal Wounds table. Historical examples of heavy helmets include the classical Corinthian helmet, Roman gladiatorial helmets, and the medieval armet, barbute, close helm, great helm, and hounskull.

**Helmet, Light:** This is any leather or metal open-faced helmet designed to protect the head and neck while maintaining unrestricted sight and breathing. A light helmet is included in the cost of any suit of armor. If a suit of armor is worn without a helmet, decrease the character’s armor class by 1 point and its encumbrance by 1/6 st. A light helmet can purchased separately from a suit of armor at a cost of 5gp, but provides no in-game benefit. Historical examples include the Illyrian, Phyrgian, Boeotian, Attic, and Galean helmets of Antiquity, the medieval bascinet, nasal helm, and spangenhelm, and the Renaissance burgonet and sallet.

**Hide and Fur Armor:** Hide and fur armor is made of stitched-together hair and skin of animals layered to a thickness of around 10mm. Unlike leather armor, the skins are not hardened with boiling. Hide and fur armor’s only advantages are that it is inexpensive, lightweight, and protective against cold.

**Lamellar Armor:** Lamellar armor is made of small bronze, iron, or steel plates laced together in parallel rows with silk, leather thongs, or cotton. It is similar to scale armor, from which it evolved, and comparable in protection to banded armor. Lamellar is generally worn as a cuirass over light chain or leather, and sometimes sewn to the backing. Lamellar would also include leather lames worn over chain. Historical examples include Mongolian lamellar, medieval brigandine and splinted armor, Japanese o-yori armor, and Roman lorica squamata.

**Laminated Linen Armor:** Laminated linen armor is made of 20 layers of laminated linen glued together to a thickness of 11.5mm. The composite material affords protection comparable to mail. Laminated linen armor usually consists of spaulders (shoulder armor), cuirass, and tassets (flaps covering the groin and thighs) worn with a bronze or iron helmet and pair of greaves. The chief historical example is Macedonian linothorax armor.

**Leather Armor:** Leather armor is made of hardened leather layered 5mm thick. Leather armor usually consists of spaulders (shoulder armor), cuirass, and tassets (flaps covering the groin and thighs). It is lighter but less protective then more reinforced leather armors such as ring mail. A historical example is Late Medieval cuir bouilli.

**Padded Armor:** Padded armor is made from quilted padding of linen or wool, layered to a thickness of approximately 10mm. Padded armor provides limited protection compared to hard armors. Historical examples include the arming doublet, gambeson, and padded jack.

**Plate Armor:** Plate armor is made from large bronze or iron plates, up to 2mm thick, worn over the chest and vital areas. Chain mail or other protective covering might cover exposed joints. Plate armor provides superior protection over banded plate and lamellar, having larger plates sewn onto a stronger backing. Plate armor is scarce in the Auran Empire setting. As the pinnacle of personal protection it can only be manufactured by master armorers. Only the dwarves, who have a surplus of such smiths, can field large numbers of infantry in plate. The volume of plate armor for sale on the Equipment Availability by Market Class table is halved in human or elven settlements. Historical examples include archaic panoply (worn with pauldrons, vambraces, and greaves), medieval plate-and-mail armor, Middle Eastern mirror armor, Eastern European plated mail, and Japanese tatami-do.

**Ring Mail Armor:** Ring mail armor is leather or padded armor that has a large number of small rings sewn directly over the foundation garment. Unlike chain mail, the rings are not physically interlocked with each other, so protection is inferior. Ring mail is closely related to scale armor, which sews leather or horn scales onto the foundation garment, and provides comparable protection. Historical examples include Frankish ring mail, Asian ring armor on leather, and Renaissance eyelet doublets.

**Scale Armor:** Scale armor consists of many small leather, cuir bouilli, or horn scales attached to a backing material of cloth or leather. Scale armor usually consists of a corselet or hauberk worn with leather or padded cloth. It is lighter than lamellar armor, which uses metal scales or lames over leather, and comparable to ring mail. Historical examples include Scythian scale armor, Egyptian scale armor, and early medieval scale armor.

**Shield:** A character with a shield equipped has his Armor Class increased by 1 point. Option rules that differentiate shields by their historical type (e.g. buckler, heater shield, kite shield) can be found in the ***ACKS Judges Journal***.

**Shield, Mirror:** This shield is entirely made of steel polished to a high reflectivity inside and out. A mirror shield can be used to check around corners, defend or reflect monstrous gaze attacks, and repel certain creatures. A character using a mirror shield to see his target suffers a -2 penalty to attack throws and does not gain the shield’s bonus to AC. However, he is immune to effects that require him to **behold** the target (see p. XX).

###### Adventuring Equipment Descriptions

**Adventurer’s Harness:** Also known as a burglar’s harness or delver’s harness, this is a set of belts, straps, sheaths, and cases designed to securely fasten items to one’s body without hampering movement. A character wearing an adventurer’s harness can ignore 1 stone’s worth of equipment when calculating encumbrance. It cannot secure heavy items, or coins and similar items. It cannot be worn over heavy armor.

**Archery Target:** A device for training troops in marksmanship. An archery target is a 2’ diameter board of soft wood, usually covered by thick cloth or cork. Trainees practice shooting at the target at various ranges, aiming to land the highest possible number of arrows into the target within a given time. The cost of archery targets is already included in the training costs for missile troops. An archery target weighs 2 stone (20 lbs).

**Army Emblem:** A silver or gold figurine mounted on a pole above the army’s standard. The emblem is treasured by the army as the symbol of its strength, honor, and glory. If an army’s standard is not provided with an emblem, its morale score is reduced by 1. Loss of an army’s standard and/or emblem reduces its morale score by 1 and counts as a calamity (p. XX). In the Auran Empire, the emblem of its armies is the winged sun.

**Backpack:** A backpack is a bag worn strapped on an adventurer’s back by a pair of shoulder straps. Using a backpack allows an adventurer to keep his hands free while carrying up to 4 stone (40 lbs) of equipment.

**Blanket:** A large woven covering that provides warmth and comfort. A character resting under a blanket is considered to have protection from frigid weather (p. XX) unless there is flurry or snowy precipitation. In this case, a tent is also required.

**Boardgame:** Rulers and officers enjoy the intellectual stimulation of a variety of strategic boardgames. The listed price is for a basic wooden board with bone or stone pieces. Vastly more expensive boardgames may feature inlaid woods, precious metals, and gem-carved pieces. Historical examples include the Egyptian senet (“passing”), Germanic hnefatafl (“king’s table”), Indian chaturanga (“game of four divisions”), Roman latrones (“game of brigands”), and Sumerian ur (“game of twenty squares”). In the Auran Empire, the most popular boardgame is kyrpeges(“wargame”).

**Bowquiver:** This all-in-one leather case is designed to carry both a bow and its arrows. The bow can be placed in the bowquiver already strung, and will rest securely with about half of its length extending out of the case. A special pocket on the front of the bowquiver can hold up to 20 arrows. The bowquiver can be hung from a belt hook at the waist or from a strap over the shoulder. An empty bowquiver counts as 1 item for encumbrance purposes, while a bowquiver with composite bow and 20 arrows counts as 2 items. In the Auran Empire setting, bowquivers are only available in Skysostan.

**Candles:** A candle is a pillar-shaped light source made of wax or tallow. When lit, a candle sheds bright light out to a 5’ radius and dim light to another 10’ (15’ total), burning for 6 turns (1 hour). Wax candles burn cleanly, but tallow candles produce a foul smelling smoke. Adventurers carrying tallow candles will never surprise creatures with **acute olfaction**.

**Craftsman’s Tools:** Craftsman’s tools include the various implements used by tradesman in their craft. Craftsman’s tools are required to make Craft proficiency throws. Each craft has its own specific type of craftsman’s tools. Craftsman’s tools weigh 1 stone.

**Craftsman’s Workshop:** A craftsman’s workshop has a full complement of craftsman’s tools and furnishings sufficient to allow up to 8 craftsmen to work together. A master craftsman must have access to a craftsman’s workshop in order to increase the productivity of journeymen and apprentices. Each craft has its own specific type of craftsman’s workshop. When set up, a workshop takes up 20’ x 20’ space.

**Crowbar:** A crowbar is a long, slender bar of solid iron with a curved hook on one end, used to lever against objects to apply force. 2’ to 3’ long and made of solid iron. A crowbar grants a +2 bonus to Dungeonbashing proficiency throws to open doors, smash crates, and so on. If used in melee, a crowbar counts as a club.

**Crutch:** A shoulder-height padded staff used by characters with missing or maimed legs who lack prostheses. A crutch has an encumbrance of 1 stone (10 lbs) and requires one free arm to use.

**Dice:** Dice are commonly available in many shapes and sizes, made from bone, ivory, talus, or wood.

**Disguise Kit:** A set of cosmetics, dyes, pigments, and wigs that can be used by a skilled practitioner to disguise his appearance.

**Earplugs:** Made of clay, cotton, or wax, these protect the wearer from loud sounds. Commanders may issue these to troops that will face harpies on the field of battle. Adventurers can wear earplugs loosely to reduce earshot by half or tightly to become **deafened**.

**Ear Trumpet:** A funnel-shaped tube of silver, wood, shell, or horn that, when placed in its wearer’s ear canal, raises the apparent volume of sound. A character using an ear trumpet when listening at a door or wooden wall can ignore the 5’ penalty to his earshot range from the door or wall. While using the ear trumpet, the character cannot wear a helmet and must hold it in his ear with one hand.

**Firewood Bundle:** A bundle of pre-cut dried logs about 5 lbs in weight, 12” in length and 6” in diameter. One firewood bundle will maintain a campfire for 1 hour. Note that firewood is not the construction-quality timber bought and sold in mercantile ventures. A full cord of firewood costs between 2sp and 1gp depending on the proximity to forests.

**Flag:** Symbols and signaling devices used by armies. Pennants are 2’ square and are carried as insignia by company- sized units or individual heroes. A pennant with pole weighs 1/4 stone. Banners are 6’ long by 2’ wide, and are carried as insignia by battalion- or regiment-sized units. A banner with pole weighs 1 stone. Standards are 12’ long by 4’ tall or more, and are carried as insignia for brigade-sized units, divisions and armies. A standard with pole weighs 4 stone. Standards may be topped by emblems (see above). If a unit or division is not provided with a flag of the appropriate size, its morale score is reduced by 1. Loss of a unit’s flag reduces its morale score by 1 and counts as a calamity.

**Grappling Hook:** These iron implements can be used to anchor a rope in place on their sturdy prongs. The hook may be thrown or attached manually by a climber. A successful attack throw is required to throw a grappling hook onto a target. The attack throw suffers a -2 penalty if the target is 11’ – 30’ away, a -5 penalty if the target is 31 – 50’ away, and a -10 penalty if the target is 50’ to 100’ away. A grappling hook thrown against a creature functions as a bola (p. XX) but suffers a -2 penalty to attack throws.

**Hammer (small):** The small hammer can be used for construction or as a mallet with iron or wooden spikes. If used in melee, it counts as a small weapon and deals 1d4 bludgeoning damage.

**Herb, Aloe:** Aloe, also known as burn plant, is a healing herb used to treat burns. A character with Healing proficiency can use 1 lb of aloe in a liniment to treat a patient with acid, cold, electric, or fire damage. The patient is healed 1d3 damage, or up to the amount of acid, cold, electric, or fire damage suffered, whichever is less. A patient cannot be treated with a liniment of aloe more than once per day. Applying the liniment takes 1 turn (10 minutes).

**Herb, Belladonna:** Belladonna, also known as deadly nightshade, is a poisonous flower. A character who eats 1 lb of belladonna within one hour of being infected with lycanthropy may make a Death saving throw to shake off the affliction. If the character fails the saving throw, however, he dies from the poison after one turn. Even if the poison is then neutralized or the character is raised from the dead, he will still be afflicted with lycanthropy, and further doses of belladonna will be of no use. If purified by an alchemist or poisoner, belladonna can become even deadlier, such that a few drops can poison a blade or cup of water (see p. XX).

**Herb, Birthwort:** Birthwort, also known as snakeroot, is a healing herb used as a remedy for snake bites and other poisons. 1 lb of birthwort can be applied as a poultice to a poisoned wound by an adventurer with the Healing proficiency. Used in this manner, it provides a +2 bonus on the Healing proficiency throw to *neutralize poison*.

**Herb, Bitterwood:** Bitterwood, also known as quassia, is a healing herb used to induce vomiting. A character with Healing proficiency can treat a patient who has ingested poison within 1 turn (10 minutes) with an emetic made from 1lb of bitterwood. Upon consuming the emetic, the patient must make a Death saving throw. If the save succeeds, the patient spends the next 1d3 turns purging himself of the poison, gaining the benefits of *neutralize poison*. If the save fails, the character still loses 1d3 turns purging himself, but it does not neutralize the poison. Administering the emetic takes 1 round.

**Herb, Blessed Thistle:** Blessed thistle, also known as spotted thistle, is a healing herb that helps wounds heal more quickly. A character with the Healing proficiency can use a poultice made from 1 lb of blessed thistle to treat a wounded patient at any time. If the patient rests, the number of hp he recovers from resting that day is doubled. If the patient does not rest, he recovers one-half the hit points he would have recovered if he had rested. Applying the poultice takes 1 round.

**Herb, Comfrey:** Comfrey, also known as bruisewort and knitbone, is a powerful healing herb. An adventurer with Healing proficiency can use a poultice made from 1 lb of comfrey to treat a wounded character immediately after a battle. This heals 1d3 damage. A character cannot be treated with comfrey more than once per day.

**Herb, Garlic:** Garlic causes a vampire to **cower** for one round when presented by Lawful character with a WIL of 13 or higher. A vampire will not cower more than once per turn from garlic.

**Herb, Goldenrod:** Goldenrod is a healing herb used to treat diseases such as rheumatism, gout, and consumption. An adventurer with Healing proficiency can use a tincture made from 1 lb of goldenrod to treat sick characters. Used in this manner, it provides a +2 bonus on the Healing proficiency throw to *cure disease*.

**Herb, Horsetail:** Horsetail, also known as snake grass, is a healing herb that slows bleeding and promotes clotting. A character with Healing proficiency can use a poultice made of 1 lb of horsetail to treat the wounds of an unconscious and possibly mortally wounded patient (with 0 hit points or fewer). Used in this manner, it provides an additional +2 bonus to the patient’s 1d20 roll on the Mortal Wounds table. A character with two ranks of Healing proficiency can use a poultice of horsetail to delay death with a proficiency throw of 18+ (one attempt per patient). A character with three ranks of Healing proficiency can use a poultice of horsetail to *delay death* (as the spell) with a proficiency throw of 14+. Applying the poultice takes 1 round.

**Herb, Lungwort:** Lungwort is a healing herb used to treat diseased and damaged lungs. A character with Healing proficiency can brew a tincture from 1 lb of lungwort to relieve a patient of the expedition movement penalty and rest requirements from permanent wounds (“lungs and heart damaged”). Brewing the tincture takes 1 turn (10 minutes) and the relief lasts for 4 hours.

**Herb, Willow-Bark:** Willow-bark is a healing herb that relieves aches, pain, and rheumatism. A character with Healing proficiency can brew a tincture from 1 lb of willow-bark to relieve a patient of the initiative penalty from permanent wounds (e.g. “stiff and scarred wounds” and “lasting wounds that ache in bad weather”), from inability to force march due to permanent wounds (“damage to hips and lower back” “damage to knee,” “lungs and heart damaged”), or from the attack throw and damage roll penalty from force marching. Brewing the tincture takes 1 turn (10 minutes) and the relief lasts for 4 hours.

**Herb, Wolfsbane:** Wolfsbane (dried aconite flowers) may drive off werewolves and other lycanthropes if a character strikes the monster in hand-to-hand combat with the sprig. If the lycanthrope fails a Death saving throw, it must flee as if rebuked. Wolfsbane can be used to make a plant poison (p. XX). A character foolish enough to eat a pound of fresh wolfsbane must make a Death saving throw or die after one turn.

**Herb, Woundwart:** Woundwart, also known as heal-all or lamb’s ear, is a herbal medicine with curative properties. An adventurer with Healing proficiency can use 1 lb of woundwart to make a tincture to treat injured characters. Used in this manner, it provides a +2 bonus on proficiency throws to *cure light injury* and *cure serious injury*.

**Holy Book:** A holy book is a parchment, papyrus, or vellum codex or scroll of religious writings. Access to a relevant holy book grants a +2 bonus on Theology proficiency throws. A typical holy book is 12”-13” tall, 9”-10” wide, and about 1.5” thick. It counts as 1/2 stone or three items for encumbrance purposes. Historical examples include the Egyptian Book of the Dead, the Ancient Greek Theogony, and the Chinese Tao Te Ching. In the Auran Empire, the Seven Radiant Scrolls are the most widely-read holy books.

**Holy Symbol:** A crusader must have a holy symbol in order to rebuke undead and maintain their code of behavior. These symbols will be different for each religion, but they are often worn as a necklace. In the Auran Empire, the holy symbol of Ammonar is the winged sun.

**Holy Water:** Holy water is water that has been sanctified by a divine caster of 7th caster level or higher. It is used in certain religious rites. Crusaders often carry vials of holy water to use as weapons against the undead. A chaotic enchanted creature splashed with holy water suffers 1d8 luminous damage for 2 rounds. Holy water cannot retain its holy power if it is stored in any other container than the special vials it is placed in when blessed.

**Ink:** This is a small pot of black ink. Cinnabar, red ochre, sepia, and verdigris ink cost twice as much. Purple ink costs ten times as much. Regardless of color, a pint of ink can be used to write or illustrate up to 2,500 pages.

**Journal:** A journal is a folded parchment or papyrus notebook used for writing ship’s logs, maps, illustrations, and book-keeping entries. A journal has 50 pages and is considerably less sturdy than a spell book. A historical example is the Roman pugillares membrane.

**Iron Spikes:** These sturdy pitons can be used to wedge doors open or spike them shut or to provide belaying points for ropes. A set of six iron spikes counts as one item.

**Laborer’s Tools:** A collection of tools useful to the unskilled laborer, including an axe, mattock, saw, shovel, and sickle. Laborer’s tools are required for troops to assist in construction projects. Laborer’s tools weigh 1 stone (10 lbs).

**Lantern:** A lantern is a portable container that holds a wick in oil. Lanterns consume one flask of common oil for each 4 hours (24 turns) of light. They shed bright light to a radius of 15’ and dim light to a radius of 30’. Lanterns can be closed to conceal the light or protect it from wind.

**Lock:** These are mechanisms designed to secure chests, doors, and other portals from those who lack the key. More complex locks, made by highly skilled locksmiths, might be available (Judge’s discretion); these impose penalties on a character’s proficiency throws to open it.

**Manacles:** These are metal fetters designed to shackle a creature’s hands or ankles. A character with Contortionism proficiency can escape from manacles in 1 turn with a proficiency throw of 18+. Breaking free of manacles through brute strength requires 1 turn and a proficiency throw to open doors with a -6 penalty. Any bonuses or penalties that would apply to a proficiency throw to open doors also apply to this roll. (For example, a character with STR 18 would gain a +12 bonus to break free of manacles, while a character with Dungeonbashing proficiency would gain a +4 bonus). Manacles of unusual material or size may impose a penalty on this proficiency throw.

**Mess Kit:** A collection of portable eating and cooking utensils designed for troops on extended military campaigns. An Auran legionnaire’s mess kit includes a mess tin, cooking pot, skewer, and dagger.

**Metamphora:** Designed to store special components, metamphora are ceramic jars inscribed with alchemical sigils and stoppered with copper seals. Metamphora come in an array of different sizes and shapes, as more valuable special components require sturdier, stronger metamphora to prevent leakage. Metamphora cost 5gp and weigh 1 stone for every 60gp of value they can store.

**Mirror:** A mirror can be used to check around corners, defend or reflect monstrous gaze attacks, and repel certain creatures. A character using a mirror to see his target suffers a -2 penalty to attack throws, and cannot use a shield, second weapon, or two-handed weapon. However, he is immune to effects that require him to behold the target (see p. XX).

**Musical Instrument:** A wide variety of instruments are available to bards and performers, including stringed instruments, percussion instruments, brass instruments, and woodwind instruments. Historical examples of stringed instruments are the cithara, harp, lyre, lute, psaltery, and zither. Historical percussion instruments include the castanet, chimes, drum, gong, sistrum, tambourine, and tympani. Historical brass instruments include the buccina, carnyx, cornu, and salpinx. Historical woodwind instruments include the aulos, flute, horn, pan pipe, and shawm. A common instrument costs 25gp. A superior instrument costs 105gp and adds +1 to Performance proficiency throws made with it. A masterpiece instrument costs 675gp and adds +2 to Performance proficiency throws made with it. Most instruments weighs 1 stone.

**Oil:** Common oil is burned in a lantern to give light. Common oil is usually olive oil, castor oil, or animal extract. Military oil is a weapon made of naphtha, and cannot be easily doused with water. Military oil may be thrown at monsters, dealing 1d8 fire damage for 2 rounds to the creature struck, or poured on the floor and ignited to burn for a full turn and delay pursuit.

**Pavilion:** A large round tent with an interior frame, measuring 24’ in diameter and 12’ in height. Pavilions are used by army leaders and division commanders as command posts and sleeping quarters. A pavilion weighs 72 stone (720 lbs).

**Pell:** A device for training troops in sword and shield techniques. A pell is generally a stout wooden post, man-height and about 6” to 1’ in diameter, planted firmly in the ground. The trainee practices striking the pell with a wooden sword and shield. The cost of pells is already included in the training costs for infantry troops. A pell weighs 15 – 30 stone (150 – 300 lbs).

**Pole, Wooden:** This pole is a shaft of wood 10’ long and 2” thick. Adventurers often carry 10’ poles to prod and poke areas that might be trapped, test the strength of ledges or floors, or measure the depth of pools. Although not heavy, wooden poles are cumbersome; they count as 1 stone for encumbrance.

**Pouch/purse:** These are 6” x 1’ bags of cloth or leather that can contain half a stone (5 lbs). They can be carried on a shoulder strap or on a belt.

**Prosthesis:** Nothing is as common as the sight of an old soldier with a missing limb. Most maimed characters, lacking the wealth to pay for a restore life and limb spell, replace the limb with a prosthesis. Basic prostheses are made of wood or bronze, but prostheses may be also made of iron (cost x2), silver (x5), or gold (x50). Decorations, leather or silk wrappings, and other adornment is extra. A character with a prosthetic arm or hand regains the ability to use a shield. Alternatively, the arm or hand may be replaced by a weapon, such as a club, hook, or short sword. A character with a prosthetic leg or foot can walk without use of a crutch, but does not avoid the movement and Dexterity penalties from loss of the limb. Dwarven machinists may be able to forge superior prostheses using gears and clockwork mechanisms. See ***By This Axe*** for information on dwarven machinists.

**Quill:** A writing implement made from the flight feather of a large bird such as an eagle, goose, or swan. A carefully-maintained quill can write 50 pages before replacement is required.

**Quintain:** A device for training cavalry troops in lance and sword techniques. A quintain consists of a shield or plank mounted on a swiveling pole. A club is affixed to the opposite end of the pole. The trainee practices striking the shield with sufficient velocity to avoid being struck by the club as it swivels around. The cost of quintains is already included in the training costs for cavalry. A quintain weighs 20 stone (200 lbs).

**Rations, Iron:** This food is dried, pickled, salted, smoked, or otherwise preserved from spoilage. Iron rations will remain digestible for two months in the wilderness and a week in the foul conditions of a dungeon. The cost for iron rations will vary depending on quality. The cheapest iron rations consist of hard, dried salted biscuits. Better rations include salted or pickled meat and dried, pickled, or preserved fruit and vegetables. A day’s iron rations counts as 1/6 stone (one item) for encumbrance purposes, while a week’s iron rations count as one stone.

**Rations, Standard:** This is fresh food. While cheaper and tastier than iron rations, standard rations do not remain edible for long: one week in the wilderness and one day in dank dungeons. The cost for this food will vary depending on quality. The cheapest standard rations include fresh bread, cheese, and butter, lard, or oil. Better standard rations will include bacon or other meat, eggs, beans, and fresh fruit and vegetables. A day’s standard rations counts as 1/6 stone (one item) for encumbrance purposes, while a week’s standard rations count as one stone.

**Rope, 50’:** This strong cord, woven of hair, hemp, or other fibers, can bear 50 stone (500 lbs). A 50’ length of rope weighs 1 stone.

**Rucksack:** A rucksack is a small backpack. It holds up to 2 stone (20 lbs).

**Sack, Large:** This is a 2’ x 4’ burlap, cloth, or leather bag that can contain 6 stone (60 lbs). It is normally carried over the shoulder and dropped when combat begins.

**Sack, Small:** This is a 1’ x 2’ burlap, cloth, or leather bag that can contain 2 stone (20 lbs). It is often tied to a belt or spearhead.

**Saddlebag:** This is a long pocketed leather sack that can contain 3 stone (30 lbs). It is designed to be slung over a mount or pack animal.

**Saddle & Tack:** This includes a leather and wooden saddle with metal fastenings, a leather and metal bridle and bit, and stirrups. Draft saddle and tack is used to harness to a cart or wagon or carry saddlebags; it cannot be used for riding. Riding saddle and tack is designed for the rider’s comfort. Military saddle and tack is designed for stability during combat. A character in combat without a military saddle must make a Paralysis save every time he is dealt damage or be knocked off the horse. See **Mounted Combat,** p. XX.

**Scabbard:** A scabbard is a hard sheath for a dagger, short sword, sword, or two-handed sword made of wood, leather, and/or metal. The purchase price of daggers and swords includes a basic scabbard. Scabbards can be purchased separately at 10% weapon cost (excluding masterwork value). Decorative scabbards can cost much more depending on ornamentation and material!

**Spell Book (Blank):** A spell book is a codex or scroll roll used by studious spellcasters to record spell formula. Each such grimoire has 100 pages of parchment. Each spell takes up one page per spell level (one page each for 1st level spells). A typical spell book is 12”-13” tall, 9”-10” wide, and about 1.5” thick. It counts as 1/2 stone or three items for encumbrance purposes.

**Stakes and Mallet:** These 18” sharpened wood shafts come in sets of 6 and are used to destroy vampires and/or pitch tents.

**Special Components, Miscellaneous:** When a living thing dies, a residue of its soul will linger in some its component parts, such as organs and cellular fluids. These parts are known as special components and can be tapped by casters and ceremonialists to power their magic items. While the best results are gained from rare components that are unique to the spells imbued into the item, an equal value of miscellaneous special components such as spider webs, plant roots, crushed bones, and so on can be used instead if desired. The caster suffers a -1 penalty on his throw per level of the spell when using miscellaneous special components in magical research.

**Surgical Saw:** Sharp, sturdy saws are used to saw through bone and tissue when amputation of the limbs is required. Use of a surgical saw gives a bonus on Healing proficiency throws to *cure light injury* or *cure serious injury* in mortally, grievously, or critically wounded characters who need healing to survive one of these permanent wounds. The bonus is +2 from a small saw and +4 from a large saw. See **Mortal Wounds** (p. XX) for more information. A large surgical saw weighs 1 stone (10 lbs).

**Tent:** Tents are made of animal skin, stitched together over a frame and staked with ropes. A small tent is 6’ x 4’ and can sleep two men. A small tent weighs 1 stone (10 lbs). A large tent sleeps eight men. It may be round (12’ in diameter) or square (10’ on a side), and weighs 4 stone (40 lbs). Characters inside tents can ignore the effects of drizzly, flurry, rainy, or snowy precipitation (p. XX). However, tents are automatically blown down in stormy winds. Historical examples include the Roman legionary tent and the Mongol yurt.

**Thieves’ Tools:** Thieves’ tools include long metal picks and probes, fine wires, tiny saws, miniature hammers, and an assortment of skeleton keys. Thieves’ tools are required to make Lockpicking and Trapbreaking proficiency throws.

**Thieves’ Tools, Expanded:** Expanded thieves’ tools includes drills, pliers, scissors, rods, blocks, pads, tweezers, shims, and a magnifying glass. They grant a +2 bonus to Lockpicking and Trapbreaking proficiency throws. If the thief rolls a natural 1 while attempting to pick a lock, the tools may make a Death saving throw (at half the thief’s level of experience) to resist breaking (see the Adventuring chapter, p. 91). The bonus does not apply to hijinks.

**Thieves’ Tools, Superior:** Superior thieves’ tools have the same components as expanded thieves’ tools but are crafted with incredible precision. They grant a +4 to proficiency throws to Lockpicking and Trapbreaking proficiency throws. If the thief rolls a natural 1 while attempting to pick a lock, the tools can make a Death saving throw (at the thief’s level) to resist breaking (see the **Adventuring** chapter,p. XX). The bonus does not apply to hijinks.

**Tinderbox:** This is a tinderbox used to start fires. Lighting a torch with flint and steel takes a full round, and lighting any other fire with them takes at least that long.

**Torch:** Torches are 1’ to 2’ long pieces of wood tipped with pitch. A torch sheds bright light out to a 15’ radius and dim light to a 30’ radius, burning for 6 turns (1 hour). If a torch is used as a weapon, it deals 1d4 fire damage. A single torch weighs 1/6 st. while a bundle of 6 torches weighs 1 st.

**Treatise:** Treatises are encyclopedic works on a specific general proficiency such as Animal Husbandry, Healing, Knowledge (astrology), or Profession (lawyer). A typical treatise is a 12.5” high x 10” wide codex with 1,000 parchment or papyrus pages stitched into a leather-wrapped wood case. Treatises come in four tiers equivalent to proficiency ranks. An adventurer can only comprehend and benefit from a treatise of one rank higher than his own in the proficiency. It takes 6 days of dedicated activity for an adventurer to read a treatise. After reading the treatise, the adventurer can thereafter reference it to re-roll a proficiency throw for a particular activity or query. The re-roll is made at the rank of the adventurer or the treatise, whichever is worse. Referencing a treatise is an ancillary activity requiring 6 turns (one hour). The adventurer can also use the treatise to train or re-train that proficiency (p. XX) or to add its value to his research library (p. XX). See ***Axioms 14: Codex & Scroll*** for more rules on books.

**Whistle:** A signaling device made of wood, horn, or similar materials. It emits a shrill, high-pitched sound audible up to one mile.

**Waterskin/Wineskin:** This container, made of hide or preserved animal bladder, will hold about 25 ounces of fluid. Humans typically consume 1 gallon (128 fluid ounces) of water each day, or 5 waterskins’ worth.

###### Clothing Descriptions

A character is considered to have protective clothing for purposes of frigid weather if wearing a fur-lined cloak or coat, a wool tunic, a pair of wool pants, a pair of leather or wool gloves, and a fur or wool hat. A character is considered to have protective clothing for purposes of sunbaked weather if wearing a hat or hooded cloak and either armor or a cassock, chiton, or robe. See **Weathering the Wild** on p. XX.

**Belt:** Embossed leather or silk belts are worn as a sign of wealth and status.

**Boots:** Low boots come to mid-calf. High boots come to the knee or thigh and are popular for riding.

**Breastwrap:** This is a band of wool or linen wrapped across the breasts for support. Silk breastwraps signify a woman of wealth and status. Historical examples include the Greek apodesmos and Roman mamillare.

**Cassock:** A cassock is an ankle-length close-fitting outer garment, buttoned up the front, often worn by crusaders, mages, and priestesses. Cassocks of fine make might include piping, sashes, and other decorations.

**Chiton:** The chiton is a linen or wool garment made up of a single rectangle of fabric, worn draped over the shoulders and girdled around the waist. A silk chiton is a mark of status and money.

**Cloak:** A cloak is a cloth, fur, or leather garment of knee to ankle length, worn outdoors like an overcoat. Cloaks usually include a hood. Adventurers often favor military cloaks, generally worn pinned on one shoulder for ease of movement and access to a sword.

**Gloves:** Gloves are garments covering the hands, worn for comfort, fashion, or protection. However, wearing gloves does not protect against curses or oozes. Thief abilities such as pickpocketing, lockpicking, or trapbreaking cannot be performed while wearing gloves.

**Hat:** A hat is a cap, fez, turban, or other headgear for protecting the head from the elements. Citizens of the Auran Empire rarely wear hats, but in the sunbaked Sunset Kingdoms they are quite common.

**Robe:** A robe is an ankle-length loose-fitting outer garment, open or closed at the front, sometimes worn with a belt or sash. In the Auran Empire they are worn by mages of the Tower of Knowledge, but in the Sunset Kingdoms, they are widely worn. Historical examples include the jellabiya, kaftan, and thawb.

**Sandals/Shoes:** Simple leather shoes or sandals are suitable for walking long distances.

**Tunic:** A tunic is a loose-fitting linen, silk or wool garment that covers the body between the shoulders and the knees. Depending on their quality, tunics can be simple and plain or dyed, decorated, and embroidered. They are available in sleeveless, short-sleeved, or long-sleeved variants. In cool temperatures, tunics are usually worn with matching trousers. Historical examples include the Greek exomis, Roman tunica, and Byzantine dalmatica.

###### Domestic Animals

Except as noted below, animals trained for war gain a +2 bonus to morale, an additional hoof attack, and the ability to attack using their natural weapons when mounted and charging. Only war-trained animals can be equipped with barding. See the ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual***for full characteristics for each animal; see **Mounted Combat** (p. XX) for additional rules on mounted combat.

**Camels:** Single- or double-humped dromedaries are the preferred mounts for treks through arid deserts. Camels have a speed of 50’ / 150’, a normal load of 30 stone (300 lbs) and a maximum load of 60 stone (600 lbs). Camels never become dehydrated unless they go without water for more than six months. Camels can be trained for riding or war, although they are so mean-tempered by nature that they’re basically at war with the rider already. War-trained camels do not gain an additional hoof attack nor the ability to attack when the rider charges.

.**Dog, Hunting:** Hunting dogs are fast, lean hounds trained to track and bring down prey by working in packs. They have a speed of 60’ / 180’, normal load of 2 stone (20 lbs) and a maximum load of 4 stone (40 lbs). Most hunting dogs can scent prey, giving them the equivalent of three ranks of Tracking proficiency due to their keen olfaction. Sight hounds cannot track but are faster, with a speed of 80’ / 240’. Hunting dogs can assist in hunting while on wilderness expeditions.

**Dog, War:** War dogs are heavy, fierce mastiffs trained to kill on command. While dangerous, they are capable of great loyalty to their masters when properly trained. War dogs have a speed of 50’/150’, a normal load of 6 stone (60 lbs) and a maximum load of 12 stone (120 lbs).

**Donkey**: Donkeys are sure-footed, strong, and stoic equines widely used to carry packs or pull vehicles. They are smarter and tougher than horses and, relative to their weight, considerably stronger. They have a speed of 40’ / 120’, a normal load of 15 stone (150 lbs), and maximum load of 30 stones (300 lbs). Because of their sure-footedness, donkeys can be taken into the depths of a dungeon to aid in transporting equipment or treasure, and their movement multiplier in mountain hexes is x2/3 instead of x1/2. Donkeys are also efficient grazers and, if given access to sufficient pasture, can be used in an army without a supply cost. If a donkey is affected by fear due to a failed saving throw or morale roll, it becomes paralyzedrather than frightened. It remains paralyzed, unwilling to move, until attacked or until the source of fright leaves its sight. Donkeys are usually trained as draft animals. They can be trained for riding, but not for war.

**Horse, Heavy:** Heavy horses are the largest of all equines, bred to be big, strong laborers. They have a speed of 50’ / 150’, a normal load of 40 stone (40 lbs) and maximum load of 80 stones (800 lbs). Most breeds of heavy horses are too placid to be trained for war, so heavy warhorses are very expensive. A historical example is the medieval destrier (warhorse). Heavy horses are bred throughout Aurëpos, though only the Rornish typically use them as warhorses.

**Horse, Light:** Light horses are built for speed and long-distance travel. They have a speed of 80’ / 240’, a normal load of 20 stone (200 lbs) and maximum load of 40 stones (400 lbs). Light horses can be trained for riding or war. Historical examples include the medieval palfrey and jennet (riding horse), medieval rouncey (warhorse), and the Marwari and Turkoman horse. Opelenea, Shebatea, and Somirea breed the finest light horses in Aurëpos.

**Horse, Medium:** Medium horses have been bred to be fast, strong and sturdy, but are meant for shorter distance travel. They have a speed of 60’ / 180’, a normal load of 30 stone (300 lbs) and maximum load of 60 stones (600 lbs). Medium horses are neither the best riding nor draft horses, but are ideal for war, and may be trained for any such purposes. Celdorea, Jutland, Krysea, Nicea, Rorn, and Tirenea all have medium horse breeds.

**Horse, Steppe:** Steppe horses are small but sturdy breeds with exceptional strength and endurance. Brave, clever, and easily trained, they are efficient grazers and, if given access to sufficient pasture, can be used in an army without a supply cost. They have a speed of 70’ / 210’, making them almost as fast as light horses. Steppe horses have sturdy conformation giving them a normal load of 25 stone (250 lbs) and maximum load of 40 stones (400 lbs). They have rugged endurance and can force march for one day without penalty, plus one additional day for each point of CON bonus. Steppe horses can be used for draft, riding, or war. In Aurëpos, only the Skysos breed steppe horses.

**Mule:** Mules are a hybrid of a donkey and a medium horse. They have a speed of 50’ / 150’, a normal load of 25 stone (250 lbs) and maximum load of 50 stones (500 lbs). Because of their sure-footedness, mules can be taken into the depths of a dungeon to aid in transporting equipment or treasure and their movement multiplier in mountain hexes is x2/3 instead of x1/2. Mules are primarily used for draft, but can be used for riding or war. War-trained mules do not gain an additional hoof attack.

**Ox:** An ox is a castrated bull, used for cart driving. They have a speed of 40’ / 120’, a normal load of 45 stone, and a maximum load of 90 stone. Oxen are efficient grazers and, if given access to sufficient pasture, can be used in an army without a supply cost.

###### Foodstuff Descriptions

**Animal Feed:** Superior animal feed is required for riding mounts, war mounts, workbeasts and other animals engaging in high-intensity labor. Inferior animal feed can be used for other animals, such as farm animals, when insufficient pasture is available.

###### Lodging Descriptions

**Inn:** An inn is an establishment that offers food, drink, lodging, and stabling. They are a common meeting place for adventurers. Slum inns are gambling dens, whorehouses, and flophouses, frequented by gamblers, harlots, and ruffians. Average inns include coaching inns, hostels, and traveler’s lodges designed for travelers and traders. Superb inns are the preserve of wealthy merchants and nobles.

###### Structure Descriptions

|  |
| --- |
| **AC:** During sieges, attack throws may be directed at structures. Every structure has an armor class, indicating how hard it is to harm the structure. Ordinary wooden construction has AC 1. Reinforced wooden construction has AC 2. Earthen construction has AC 4. Soft stone has AC 5. Thick, heavy stone has AC 6. Round structures gain a +2 bonus to AC due to the increased likelihood of attacks bouncing off.  **SHP:** A structure’s ability to remain intact despite damage is determined by its **structural hit points (shp)**. When a structure reaches 0 or less shp, it will collapse in 1d10 rounds. As a rule of thumb, a structure will have 1 shp per ton of weight.  Wooden structures are harder to damage than creatures. Man-sized or large creatures cannot deal damage to wooden structures. Light and medium ballista deal 1/10 damage to wooden structures. Huge creatures, heavy ballista, and light catapults deal 1/3 damage to wooden structures. All other artillery, gigantic creatures, and colossal creatures deal full damage to wooden structures. Spells deal 1/10damage to wooden structures, increased if the spell has an area of effect by a factor of (AOE square footage / 25).  Concrete, earthen, and stone structures are even harder to damage. Man-sized creatures, large creatures, light ballista, and medium ballista cannot damage stone structures. Huge creatures and all other artillery deal 1/10 damage to stone structures. Gigantic creatures deal 1/3 damage to stone structures. Colossal creatures deal full damage to stone structures. Spells deal only 1/50 damage to stone structures, increased if the spell has an area of effect by a factor of (AOE square footage / 25). Fractional damage to structures is rounded down.  Some spells specifically deal structural damage. This damage is multiplied by 5 against wooden structures.  **Unit Capacity:** The number of companies (120 troops each) that can defend a structure during a siege. Unit capacity does not reflect a structure’s available living space for long-term habitation. |

**Adit:** A horizontal passage in a mine. The first adit of a mine is always delved from a mountain side towards the vein of ore. A typical adit ranges from 5’ wide and 6’ high to 15’ wide and 15’ high. Larger adits may have canals for water. All adits connect to the surface or to an adit or shaft that does.

**Arrow Slit:** A narrow vertical or cross-shaped opening in a wall through which defenders can fire missiles. Missile attacks targeting creatures behind arrow slits suffer a -4 penalty, and the defenders gain a +4 bonus to Blast saving throws caused by artillery, burning oil, or similar effects. On a successful saving throw, creatures protected by arrow slits take nodamage, even if the effect would normally deal ½ damage. Arrow slits must be purchased separately; 1 arrow slit per 5’ of wall is standard.

**Barbican:** An outer fortification consisting of a gatehouse, two small round towers, and a drawbridge. A barbican may be situated outside the stronghold and connected to the walls with a short neck. A barbican can hold 4 units.

**Barracks Block:** A 140’ long, 30’ wide, and 10’ tall building divided into fourteen rows of double rooms, each row consisting of a larger inner room (9’ wide by 18’ long) connected by a wooden door to a small outer room (9’ wide by 12’ long). A barracks block can house a company of 120 infantry along with four subalterns and a centurion. This is the most common structure in Auran Imperial forts. A map of a barracks can be found in ***AX1: The Sinister Stone of Sakkara***.

**Battlement:** A defensive structure built atop walls to protect defenders from enemy fire. A battlement consists of a chest-high barrier (parapet) running the length of the wall, pierced with periodic rectangular gaps (crenellation) through which the defenders can fire missiles. Missile attacks targeting creatures protected by battlements suffer a -4 penalty, and the defenders gain a +4 bonus to Blast saving throws caused by artillery, burning oil, or similar effects.

**Building:** A stone or wood structure, 20’ high, 30’ square, with wooden doors, floors, roof, and stairs. The walls are 4” to 5” thick. A standard building can hold 1 unit. For variant dimensions, adjust price and shp proportionately.

**Cottage:** A cottage is a 20’ high, 30’ square wooden building with a thatched roof and earthen floor, suitable for a wealthy peasant family. Cottages are used throughout Aurëpos.

**Drawbridge:** A movable bridge that can be raised or lowered across a moat to control access to the stronghold. A standard drawbridge is 10’ wide, 20’ high, and 1’ thick. For variant dimensions, adjust price and shp proportionately.

**Gatehouse:** A fortified building protecting an entrance to a stronghold or settlement. The standard gatehouse is 20’ high, 30’ wide, 20’ long, with 10’ thick walls, with a metal portcullis that can be raised or lowered to control access. For variant dimensions, adjust price and shp proportionately. A standard gatehouse can hold 2 units.

**Granary/Warehouse:** A granary is a 180’ long, 30’ wide, and 10’ tall structure used to store goods. The wood planked floors of the granaries are raised 3’ off the ground in order to keep the grain dry and to allow air to circulate easily, while a steeply pitched roof helps shed rainfall. Loading bays ascend to the raised floor at either end, terminating in large oak doors. A granary can store up to 15,000gp of supplies, including 6,500 bales of hay, 3,500 bushels of grain, and 550 amphorae or barrels. A map of a granary can be found in ***AX1: The Sinister Stone of Sakkara***.

**Headquarters:** A headquarters building stands 125’ long and 85’ wide, with 5’ thick walls, and is divided into three parts. The front half is an open colonnaded courtyard, 45’ square, surrounded by a 15’ wide, 15’ tall veranda. Beyond the courtyard is a cross-hall, 25’ wide and 75’ long, with a 25’ roof. Behind the cross-hall lies an elevated shrine flanked by a pair of offices on either side. In the Auran Empire, such buildings are used to muster troops and to store legionary standards, pay chests, administrative files, and so on. A map of a headquarters can be found in ***AX1: The Sinister Stone of Sakkara***.

**Hospital:** A 75’ square building with a 25’ square interior courtyard open to the sky. The courtyard is usually dedicated to a deity of healing and may be decorated with altars, statuary, etc. The courtyard is surrounded by two rings of rooms, with a total of 10 wards where up to four patients can be treated each (40 patients total). Hospitals are built in most Auran Imperial forts and settlements. A map of a hospital can be found **in *AX1: The Sinister Stone of Sakkara***.

**Hut:** A hut is a 10’ square building with an earthen floor and thatched roof. Serfs, unskilled laborers, and other working poor generally live in such homely dwellings

**Keep:** A fortified tower within a stronghold that serves as the lord’s residence and final redoubt during siege. The standard keep is 80’ high and 60’ square, with 10’ thick stone walls. The interior features wooden doors and stairs between its 8 floors. For square keeps with variant dimensions, adjust price and shp proportionately. A round keep costs 50% more but has +2 AC. A standard keep can hold 12 units in a siege. During peacetime, it can house one company of 120 infantry. The Auran Empire rarely builds keeps but they are in wide use in Celdorea, Jutland, and Rorn.

**Moat:** A broad, stone-lined trench surrounding a stronghold to provide an obstacle against besiegement. Most moats are filled with water, but some are left unfilled. A standard moat is 100’ long, 20’ wide, and 10’ deep. For variant dimensions, adjust price proportionately. The structural hit points of a moat represent the amount of damage necessary to collapse the moat.

**Moat, Crude:** A hastily-built field expedient trench faced with loose earth, with little to no structural support. Crude moats are much cheaper and faster to build than ordinary moats, but prone to collapse and flooding. They take 200 structural bludgeoning damage each day in rainy weather conditions (p. XX) and require 1sp of daily maintenance per 100’ length. Crude moats are otherwise identical to ordinary moats.

**Palisade:** A fence made of wooden planks or stakes. Palisades are commonly built around army encampments to provide security. They are also used to circumvallate (encircle) besieged strongholds to prevent traffic in or out. The standard palisade is 10’ high, 100’ long, and 1” thick. A 100’ palisade can be defended by 1 unit. For palisades with variant dimensions, adjust price and shp proportionately.

**Palisade, Crude:** A hastily-built fence made of tree trunks, branches, and scrap wood. Crude palisades are much cheaper and faster to build than ordinary palisades, but prone to falling apart. They take 1 structural bludgeoning damage each day of rainy, stormy, or windy weather conditions (p. XX) and require 1sp of daily maintenance per 1000’ length. Crude palisades are otherwise identical to ordinary palisades.

**Rampart:** A broad embankment made of rock fragments, debris, or earth. Ramparts may be surmounted by parapets and used as defensive walls. The standard rampart is 10’ high, 100’ long, and 15’ thick. A 100’ rampart can be defended by 1 unit. For ramparts with variant dimensions, adjust price and shp proportionately. Earthworks such as mottes and siege ramps can be constructed in this manner.

**Roads:** Roads increase the speed of creatures traveling on them by 50% (x3/2 movement modifier). They increase the speed of wheeled vehicles traveling on them by 50%, or by 100% if the vehicle’s driver has Driving proficiency. Leveled earth roads provide no benefit if the weather is rainy or the ground is muddy or snowy (see p. XX) and can never increase a vehicle’s speed to more than 60’ per round or 12 miles per day. Gravel roads provide no benefit if the ground is muddy or snowy and can never increase a vehicle’s speed to more than 60’ per round or 18 miles per day. Paved roads provided no benefit if the ground is snowy.

S**haft:** A vertical or inclined passage sunk down from the surface towards a vein of ore. A typical shaft is between 3’ and 10’ in diameter. Shafts can be entry points or vents. Entry shafts will be straight and have footholds carved into the shaft walls. Ventilation shafts often bend and turn. There will usually be at least one shaft every 100’ to 200’ of adit.

**Stable-Barracks:** A 200’ long, 50’ wide, and 15’ tall building built to house one company of 60 cavalry, along with four subalterns (platoon commanders) and one tribune (company commander), collectively spread across the block’s twelve rows. Rows are sub-divided lengthwise into two 24’ wide sections, each with an inner living quarters (16’ wide, 9’ long, and 8’ tall) connected by wooden doors to outer stables (16’ wide, 15’ long, and 10’ tall) that open up to the outside. Ladders rise from the stables to hay-lofts (16’ wide, 9’ long, and 7’ tall) that sit above the living quarters. Stable-barracks are widely used in Auran Imperial forts. A map of a stable-barracks can be found in ***AX1: The Sinister Stone of Sakkara***.

**Tower:** A tall, fortified structure within a stronghold. Towers are typically higher than the surrounding walls, offering the defenders a vantage point from which to view the surrounding area as well as a wide field of fire for missiles. Towers have 5’ thick round walls, with wooden doors, floors, and stairs. Towers have one story per 10’ of height. For round towers with variant dimensions, adjust price and shp proportionately. Square towers cost two-thirds as much but are -2 AC. A small or medium tower can hold 1 unit. A large tower can hold 2 units. A huge tower can hold 5 units.

**Townhouse:** A townhouse is a 30’ square two-story building with a wooden floor and stairs and thatched roof. Wealthy yeomen, master craftsmen, merchants, and other professionals might live in such a dwelling.

**Trap:** Any of a variety of devices used to capture or kill trespassers, often put in place by thieves when establishing hideouts and wizards when constructing dungeons. Trappers can create some of these traps (p. XX). The traps presented in this book include:

* *Arrow-Firing Trap*: When triggered, an arrow fires from a hidden location to attack the triggering creature as a 1st level fighter for 1d6+1 piercing damage. The arrow can be poisoned if desired.
* *Ceiling Collapse Trap*: When triggered, ceiling bricks or stones collapse. Each creature in a 10’ radius must make a Blast saving throw. If the save fails, the creature suffers 1d6 bludgeoning damage. If the save succeeds, the creature suffers half that damage.
* *Dart-Firing Trap*: When triggered, a dart fires from a hidden location to attack the triggering creature as 1st level fighter for 1d4+1 piercing damage. The dart is usually poisoned.
* *Deadfall Trap*: When triggered, heavy object falls from overhead tree branches, rafters, etc. Each creature in a 5’ radius must make a Blast saving throw. If the save fails, the creature suffers 1d12 bludgeoning damage. If the save succeeds, the creature dodges the deadfall. This trap can only be built outdoors. A trapper can create this trap in the wilderness.
* *Excavated Earth Pit Tarp*: A 10’ x 10’ hole in the ground covered with leaves and brush. Any creature crossing the pit falls in, taking 1d6 bludgeoning damage per 10’ fallen. A spiked floor or a trap door can be added for an additional cost. If spikes are added, 1d4 strike each character for 1d6 piercing damage. If a trap door is added, it makes the pit harder to set off with a 10’ pole (1 instead of 1-2 on d6).
* *Needle-Firing Trap*: When triggered, a small needle pops out of a lock to attack the triggering creature as a 1st level fighter for 1 piercing damage. The needle is virtually always poisoned.
* *Portcullis Trap*: When triggered, a portcullis falls suddenly downward. The creature who triggered the trap must make a Blast saving throw. If the save succeeds, the creature can choose on which side of the portcullis it lands. If the save fails, the creature suffers 1d6 piercing damage and the Judge chooses on which side of the portcullis it lands and might apply other effects.
* *Rock-Cut Pit Trap*: A 10’ x 10’ smooth-hewn pit cut into the rock and concealed by a rug or floorboard. A spiked floor or a trap door can be added for an additional cost. If spikes are added, 1d4 strike each character for 1d6 piercing damage. If a trap door is added, it makes the pit harder to set off with a 10’ pole (1 instead of 1-2 on d6).
* *Rolling Rock Trap:* When triggered, a 5’ wide boulder rolls out from a hidden location along a 30’ long path. Each creature in the boulder’s path must make a Blast saving throw. If the save fails, the creature suffers 1d6 bludgeoning damage and is knocked **prone**.
* *Scything Blade Trap:* When triggered, a scything blade swings out from a hidden location. Each creature in a 10’ line must succeed on a Blast saving throw or suffer 1d8 slashing damage.
* *Spring Snare Trap*: When triggered, a snare connected to a taut branch snare fastens around the legs of creatures in a 5’ diameter area of effect. Each creature in the area must succeed on Paralysis saving throw or suffer 1d6 bludgeoning damage and be hoisted 10’ in the air and **restrained** until he escapes or cuts free (1 hp). When a creature escapes or cuts free, it falls to the ground unless protective measures are taken, suffering an additional 1d6 bludgeoning damage per 10’ of fall.
* *Swinging Log Trap:* When triggered, a heavy log swings out from a hidden location. Each creature in a 10’ line must succeed on a Blast saving throw or suffer 1d8 bludgeoning damage.
* *Whipping Branch Trap*: When triggered, a spike-covered branch swings out from a nearby tree to attack the triggering creature as a 1st level fighter for 1d6+1 piercing damage.

**Trap Accessory:** These are additional mechanisms that can be added to make traps more dangerous.

* *Pit Spikes:* A set of spikes rising from the floor of the pit. Creatures that fall into the pit are impaled on 1d4 spikes, each dealing 1d6 piercing damage in addition to damage caused by falling.
* *Pit Cover, Concealed Trap Door*: A pressure-sensitive trap door that only triggers when an appropriate weight is on top. The weight requirement makes it harder to set off with a 10’ pole (1 instead of 1-2 on d6).
* *Pit Cover, Concealed Spring-Loaded Trap Door*: A pressure-sensitive trap door (as above) that springs shut after being triggered. It cannot be opened from inside the pit except by Dungeonbashing or Trapbreaking.

**Villa:** The domicile of a high-ranking noble and his family, the 75’-square villa is quite luxurious. At its center is an open-air peristyle garden bordered by a colonnaded arcade which grants access to the villa’s various rooms, including multiple bedrooms, formal dining room, reception room, private bath, private shrine, and private stables. A map of a villa can be found in ***AX1: The Sinister Stone of Sakkara***.

**Wall:** A fortified barrier used to protect a stronghold or settlement from besiegers. A stone wall is 100’ long and 10’ thick, with height ranging from 20’ to 60’ high. For walls with variant dimensions, adjust price and shp proportionately. Walls may be built up to 200’ high, but cost is doubled for construction over 60’ high. A 100’ length of wall can be defended by 1.5 units stationed at the top of the wall, plus an additional 1.5 units per 10’ of height, firing through arrow slits. (Arrow slits, battlements, drawbridges, and other features must be purchased separately. 1 arrow slit per 5’ per story is required for a multi-story wall to be defended with arrows.) Add up the length of all sections of wall to determine the number of units that can defend them.

###### Vehicle Descriptions

**Cart, Large:** A large cart is an open, two-wheeled vehicle meant for shipment. It may be pulled by one or two heavy horses. One ox, two mules, or two medium horses can be substituted for 1 heavy horse. If the cart is pulled by only one heavy horse, it can transport up to 80 stone at 60’ per turn, or up to 120 stone at 30’ per turn. If pulled by 2 heavy horses, it can transport up to 160 stone at 60’ per turn, or up to 240 stone at 30’ per turn. Carts can only move through deserts, mountains, forests, or swamps if a road is available. Carts can be driven by any character, but travel faster on roads if the driver has Driving proficiency. A large cart has AC 0 and 2 shp.

**Cart, Small:** A small cart is an open, two-wheeled vehicle meant for personal transport. It may be pulled by one or two mules. If the cart is pulled by only one mule, it can transport up to 50 stone at 60’ per turn, or up to 75 stone at 30’ per turn. If pulled by two mules, it can transport up to 100 stone at 60’ per turn, or up to 150 stone at 30’ per turn. Carts can only move through deserts, mountains, forests, or swamps if a road is available. Carts can be driven by any character, but travel faster on roads if the driver has Driving proficiency. A small cart has AC 0 and 2 shp.

**Chariot, Heavy:** A heavy chariot is an open, two- or four-wheeled vehicle used in warfare. The cab is constructed from slates of hardwood and reinforced with bronze. The axle is set beneath the center of the cab, adding to strength of construction. The chariot’s wheels are about 5’ in diameter. Its wheel track is about 7’ wide, while its total length is 15’. The cab measures 4’6” wide, 3’3” deep, and 3’9” high, with room for four man-sized creatures, one of whom must be the driver. The cab includes three built in weapon-cases, with room for a composite bow, 3 javelins, and 20 arrows. The armored cab provides its occupants with a +2 AC bonus against attacks to the front and flank. A heavy chariot has AC 2 and 2 shp.

A heavy chariot may be pulled by two, three, or four creatures whose normal loads add up to at least 80 stone. When used in war, heavy chariots are typically pulled by three medium horses or four light horses. The chariot can transport up to the harnessed creatures’ combined normal load at half the harnessed creatures’ speed, or up to the harnessed creature’s combined maximum load at one quarter the harnessed creatures’ speed. The chariot cannot exceed 90’ per turn in any case. Heavy chariots can only move through deserts, forests, mountains, or swamps if a road is available. Chariots can be driven by any character, but travel faster on roads if the driver has Driving proficiency. Historical examples include the Neo-Assyrian chariot, Chinese Anyang-type chariot, and Classical Indian chariot.

**Chariot, Light:** A light chariot is an open, two-wheeled vehicle used for hunting, racing, or warfare. It is built for speed, with a lightweight frame of elm or ash covered by hide. The axle is set at the very rear of the body for maximum mobility and stability. The chariot’s wheels are about 2’6” in diameter. Its wheel track is about 5’9” wide, while its total length, including harnessed creatures, is 11’6”. The cab measures 3’3” wide, 1’8” deep, and 2’6” high, with room for two man-sized creatures, one of whom must be the driver. The cab includes three built in weapon-cases, with room for a composite bow, 3 javelins, and 20 arrows. A light chariot has AC 0 and 1 shp.

A light chariot may be pulled by one or two creatures whose normal loads add up to at least 40 stone. When used in war, light chariots are typically pulled by two light horses. The chariot can transport up to the harnessed creatures’ combined normal load at ¾ the harnessed creatures’ speed, or up to the harnessed creature’s combined maximum load at 3/8 the harnessed creatures’ speed. The chariot cannot not exceed 180’ per turn in any case. Light chariots can only move through deserts, forests, mountains, or swamps if a road is available. Chariots can be driven by any character, but travel faster on roads if the driver has Driving proficiency. Historical examples include the New Kingdom Egyptian chariot, the Mycenaean rail-chariot, and the Celtic chariot.

**Chariot, Medium:** A medium chariot is an open, two-wheeled vehicle used in hunting and warfare. The cab is constructed from slates of hardwood. The axle is set beneath the center of the cab, adding to strength of construction. The chariot’s wheels are about 3’ in diameter. Its wheel track is about 6’6” wide, while its total length is 13’. The cab measures 4’ wide, 3’ deep, and 3’ high, with room for three man-sized creatures, one of whom must be the driver. The cab includes three built in weapon-cases, with room for a composite bow, 3 javelins, and 20 arrows. The sturdily-built cab provides its occupants with a +1 AC bonus against attacks to the front and flank. A medium chariot has AC 1 and 1 shp.

A medium chariot may be pulled by two or three creatures whose normal loads add up to at least 60 stone. When used in war, medium chariots are typically pulled by two medium horses or three light horses. The chariot can transport up to the harnessed creatures’ combined normal load at 2/3 the harnessed creatures’ speed, or up to the harnessed creature’s combined maximum load at 1 / 3 the harnessed creatures’ speed. The chariot cannot exceed 120’ per turn in any case. Medium chariots can only move through deserts, forests, mountains, or swamps if a road is available. Chariots can be driven by any character, but travel faster on roads if the driver has Driving proficiency. Historical examples include the Hittite Anatolian-type chariot and the Mycenaean box chariot.

**Howdah:** A howdah is a carriage mounted on the back of a creature of huge, gigantic, or colossal size. Howdahs of any size can be built for riding or war. Riding howdah are lightweight wicker frames covered by hide. War howdah are sturdy wooden towers with crenellations; these cost and weigh twice as much. Both types are often laminated, painted, and opulently decorated.

* Colossal howdah are 12’ long, 10’ wide, and 4’6” tall. They weigh 60 stone (600 lbs), have AC 0, 1 shp, and can carry 20 man-sized creatures (up to 40 if squeezed). War howdah of this size weigh 120 stone (1,200 lbs) and have AC 1 and 2 shp. The occupants gain a +4 AC bonus and a +4 bonus to saving throws versus Blast caused by artillery, burning oil, or similar effects.
* Gigantic howdah are 7’ long, 5’ wide, and 4’ tall. They weigh 18 stone (180 lbs), have AC 0, 1 shp, and can carry 6 man-sized creatures (up to 12 if squeezed). War howdah of this size weigh 36 stone (360 lbs) and have AC 1 and 1 shp. The occupants gain a +4 AC bonus and a +4 bonus to saving throws versus Blast caused by artillery, burning oil, or similar effects.
* Huge howdah are 4’ long, 3’ wide, and 3’ tall. They weigh 6 stone (60 lbs), have AC 0, 1 shp, and can carry 2 man-sized creatures (up to 4 can squeeze in, but the occupants suffer a -4 penalty to attack throws and -2 AC penalty due to the confined quarters). War howdah of this size weigh 15 stone (150 lbs) and have AC 1 and 1 shp. The occupants gain a +3 AC bonus and a +3 bonus to saving throws versus Blast caused by artillery, burning oil, or similar effects.

**Palanquin:** A palanquin consists of a seat or platform mounted between a pair of long sturdy poles. The passenger or passengers sit upon the seat or platform while the palanquin itself is borne on the shoulders of laborers who operate in teams of 2 to 12. The laborers march at a smooth gait and can achieve speeds of up to 3 miles per hour. While this is no faster than walking, the passengers of a palanquin don’t mind: palanquins are the most luxurious and comfortable way to travel available, short of magic.

* A small palanquin is a 4’ long, 4’ wide, and 4’ tall wooden chair mounted between a pair of poles extending 5’ to the front and rear. A pair of laborers can carry one passenger (or up to 15 stone) at an encounter speed of 60’ or two passengers (up to 35 stone) at 30’. A small palanquin weighs 5 stone (50 lbs). Small palanquins are a common mode of transport for patricians in Auran cities, where the crowded conditions make it hard to move fast anyway.
* A medium palanquins is a 4’ long, 6’ wide, and 4’ tall wooden cabin mounted between a pair of poles extending 5’ to the front and rear. A team of four laborers can carry one passenger (or up to 18 stone) at an encounter speed of 90’ or two passengers (or up to 30 stone) at 60’. A medium palanquin weighs 10 stone (100 lbs). The cabin provides its occupants with a +1 AC bonus. Medium palanquins are a popular vehicle for patricians traveling between nearby cities.
* A large palanquin is an 8’ long, 6’ wide, and 6’ tall wooden cabin mounted between a pair of poles extending 7.5’ to the front and rear. A team of eight laborers can carry two passengers (or up to 36 stone) at an encounter speed of 90’ or four passengers (or up to 60 stone) at 60’. A large palanquin weighs 20 stone (200 lbs). Large palanquins are ornate and luxurious, with rare wood inlay, polished poles, silk curtains, and more. Large palanquins are usually the preserve of rich and powerful patricians traveling between cities.
* A huge palanquin is a 10’ long, 6’ wide, 6’ tall wooden carriage mounted between a pair of poles extending 10’ to the front and rear. A team of twelve laborers can carry three passengers (or up to 54 stone) at 90’ or six passengers (or up to 90 stone) at 60’. A huge palanquin weighs 30 stone (300 lbs). Huge palanquins are as luxurious as mobile palaces, the exterior often gilded or decorated with artwork or statuary, the poles adorned with ivory handles or carved into intricate sculptures. The passengers recline on padded mattresses with silk cushions and curtains ensuring they travel in ease and comfort. An Exquisitrix of the Temple of Nasga, a Raja of Somirea, or the spouse of a Tarkaun might ride in such a litter.

Adventurers sometimes find palanquins useful when undertaking wilderness expeditions. Palanquins can be used to transport supplies along mountain passes and bad terrain that would be impassable to wheeled vehicles. Medium, large, and huge palanquins provide protection for their occupant from drizzly, flurry, rainy, and snowy precipitation (p. XX).

**Wagon:** A wagon is a four-wheeled open vehicle designed to transportpeople and property over long distances. A wagon is generally drawn by two or four heavy horses. One ox, two mules or two medium horses can be substituted for one heavy horse. If the wagon is pulled by two heavy horses, it can transport up to 160 stone at 60’ per turn, or 320 stone at 30’ per turn. If the wagon is pulled by four heavy horses, it can transport up to 320 stone at 60’ per turn, or up to 640 stone at 30’ per turn. Wagons can only move through deserts, mountains, forests, or swamps if a road is available. Wagons can be driven by any character, but travel faster on roads if the driver has Driving proficiency. A wagon has AC 1 and 3 shp.

###### Vessel Descriptions

**Barge:** A barge is a flat-bottomed vessel intended to carry cargo and passengers across rivers or coastal waters. Though they share the shallow draft of galleys, they are propelled by sail. While most barges are small, some barges reach titanic size.

* *Small:* The small barge is a 15-ton one-masted square-sailed vessel with a 50’ length, 13’ beam, and 2’ draft. It requires 5 sailors to crew and can carry 2,000 stone (20,000 lbs) of cargo.
* *Large:* The large barge is a 60-ton one-masted square-sailed vessel with a 115’ length, 20’ beam, and 3’ draft. It requires 10 sailors to crew and can carry 7,000 stone (70,000 lbs) of cargo.
* *Huge:* The huge barge is a 1,150-ton two- or three-masted square-sailed vessel with a 230’ length, 60’ beam, and 10’ draft. It requires 40 sailors to crew and can carry 135,000 stone (675 tons) of cargo.

**Boat, Row:** A rowboat is a small, flat-bottomed open vessel with a single pair of oars. It a has a length of 12’, has a beam (width) of 6’, and has a draft (surface depth) of 1’ when in the water. A rowboat requires a crew of 1 and can carry up to 100 stone (1,000 lbs).

**Boat, Sail:** A sail boat is flat-bottomed vessel with a single mast and sail. It has a length of 30’, has a beam of 10’, and has a draft of 2’ when in the water. A sail boat requires a crew of 3 and can carry up to 500 stone (5,000 lbs). A sail boat has an open deck, but a roofed cabin can be added at a cost of 1,000gp. Historical examples include the dhow and felucca.

**Canoe:** A canoe consists of a frame of light wood wrapped with bark, hides, canvas, or other waterproofed covering. Canoes are primarily used on rivers and in swamps. Canoes have a 15’ length, 5’ beam, 6” draft, and can carry 1 rower and up to 60 stone (600 lbs) of cargo. Canoes can be carried overland by two people, counting as 5 stone of encumbrance for each.

**Galley:** A galley is a sleek, slender vessel designed to voyage under sail or oar. Galleys can travel extremely swiftly across short distances, but they require large crews and are at great risk from sea storms. They lack any sleeping accommodations for their crew and are generally beached each night. Galleys come in a variety of sizes, each named for the number of rowers that man one side of a single row of oars.

Regardless of size, each galley has a mainmast and a foremast. The 1.5- and 2.5-rower galleys are built so that the mainmast can be raised or lowered swiftly and stowed without disturbing the rowers. The 2-, 3-, 4-, 5, 6-, and 8-rower galleys have bulky mainmasts that interfere with rowing when stowed. If a 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, 6-, or 8-rower galley has its main mast stowed on board, its oar sprint speed and oar cruise speed are reduced by 120’ per round because there’s not enough room for the rowers to work. These galleys usually leave their mainmasts ashore when going in to battle to avoid losing speed under oar. If a 2-, 3-, 4-, 6-, or 8-rower galley travels under sail without its main mast, its sail speed is reduced by 120’ per round and its sail voyage speed by 15 miles per day. 1.5- and 2.5-rower galleys do not face these difficulties and are better suited for adventurers, pirates, and privateers.

* *1-rower:* A 15-ton aphract (open-decked) “patrol boat” with one bank of oars, 15 per side, each rowed by one rower, creating an oar system with one rower per file. It has a length of 65’, beam of 13’9”, and a draft of 2’4”. It requires 3 sailors and 30 rowers. It has a cargo capacity of 500 st. It can carry 1 war machine weighing up to 150 st. The chief historical examples are the Roman navis lusoria and navis actuaria.
* *1**.5-rower:*A 20-ton aphract “corvette” with two banks of oars, 9 upper and 16 lower per side, each rowed by one rower, creating an oar system with one-and-a-half rowers per file. It has a length of 80’, beam of 14’3”, and a draft of 2’6”. It requires 5 sailors and 50 rowers and can carry 5 marines. It has a cargo capacity of 750 st. It can carry 2 war machines weighing up to 150 st each. The room afforded by halving the number of oars on the upper bank enables the 1.5-rower to easily stow its main mast. The 1.5 rower is primarily used by pirates, who face unique challenges: Although galleys are faster than sailing ships for short distances, they cannot sustain speed long enough to capture a sailing ship with the wind on its side. The 1.5-rower is able to operate under main sail and oar when approaching, enabling it to overtake the sailing ship, and then quickly re-configure to just oars for maneuver and boarding. The chief historical example is the Mediterranean hemiola.
* *2-rower:*A 25-ton aphract “destroyer” with two banks of oars, 23 upper and 22 lower per side, each rowed by one rower, creating an oar system with two rowers per file. It has a length of 90’, beam of 13’9”, and a draft of 2’6”. It requires 5 sailors and 90 rowers and can carry 10 marines. It has a cargo capacity of 1,000 st. It can carry 2 war machines weighing up to 200 st each. A cataphract (close-decked) 2-rower reduces its oar spring and oar cruise speed by 30’, but can carry 40 marines instead of 10. The chief historical example is the Roman liburnian.
* *2.5-rower:* A 45-ton aphract “light cruiser” with three banks of oars, 12 upper, 24 middle, and 24 lower, each rowed by one rower, creating an oar system with two-and-a-half rowers per file. It has a length of 115’, beam of 19’, and a draft of 2’6”. It requires 10 sailors and 120 rowers and can carry 10 marines. It has a cargo capacity of 1,200 st. It can carry 2 war machines weighing up to 250 st each. Like the 1.5-rower, the 2.5-rower galley’s special oar system enables it to raise, lower, and stow its main mast expeditiously. The 2.5-rower is primarily used as an anti-pirate interceptor, since it can match them for speed and overpower them in manpower. The chief historical example is the Rhodian trihemiola.
* *3-rower:* A 55-ton aphract “cruiser” with three banks of oars, 31 upper, 27 middle, and 27 lower, each rowed by one rower, creating an oar system of three rowers per file. It has a length of 130’, beam of 18’6”, and draft of 3’. It requires 15 sailors and 170 rowers and can carry 15 marines. It has a cargo capacity of 1,500 st. It can carry 2 war machines weighing up to 300 st each. A cataphract 3-rower reduces its oar sprint and oar cruise speed by 30’ but can carry 60 marines. The chief historical example is the Carthaginian, Greek, and Roman trireme.
* *4-rower:* A 65-ton cataphract (closed-deck) “heavy cruiser” with two banks of oars, 23 upper and 22 lower, each rowed by two rowers. It has a length of 120’, beam of 18’6”, and draft of 4’. It is crewed by 15 sailors and 180 rowers and can carry 75 marines. It has a cargo capacity of 2,000 st. It can carry 2 war machines weighing up to 400 st each. The chief historical example is the Hellenistic quadrireme.
* *5-rower:* A 120-ton cataphract “battleship” with three banks of 30 oars, with the upper and middle banks each rowed by two rowers and the lower bank by one rower, creating an oar system with 5 rowers per file. It has a length of 150’, a beam of 17’2”, and a draft of 5’. It requires 20 sailors and 300 rowers and can carry 75 marines. It has a cargo capacity of 5,750 st. It can carry 3 war machines weighing up to 500 st each. The chief historical example is the Hellenistic quinquereme.
* *6-rower:* A 140-ton cataphract “dreadnaught” with three banks of 30 oars, each rowed by two rowers, creating an oar system with six rowers per file. It has a length of 155’, a beam of 25’, and a draft of 6’. It requires 20 sailors and 360 rowers and can carry 100 marines. It has a cargo capacity of 6,000 st. It can carry 4 war machines weighing up to 600 st each. The chief historical example is the Hellenistic sexteres.
* *8-rower:* A 200-ton cataphract “super-dreadnaught” with two banks of oars, 40 upper and 35 lower, each rowed by four rowers, creating an oar system with eight rowers per file. It has a length of 160’, a beam of 33’, and a draft of 8’. It requires 40 sailors and 600 rowers and can carry 150 marines. It has a cargo capacity of 8,000 st. It can carry 7 war machines that weigh up to 800 st each. The chief historical example is the Hellenistic octares.

**Longship:** The longship is a graceful, light ship with a single square-sailed mast, 60’ to 80’ length, 10’ to 15’ beam, and 2’ to 3’ draft. Longships can operate equally well on oceans, coasts, or rivers, making them ideal raiding vessels. The standard crew is a captain and 75 crew, of which 15 are sailors and 60 are rowers. Longship crew are generally also marines. In addition to crew, longships are capable of holding a weight of 2,000 stone (20,000 lbs). A historical example is the Viking drakkar.

**Raft:** The raft is a simple vessel of wooden planks, logs, or reeds, with a 10’ length, 10’ in beam, and 1’ draft. The standard crew is one rower, who poles or paddles the raft. In addition to the rower, rafts can carry a weight of 150 stone (1,500 lbs). Larger rafts can be constructed from 10’ x 10’ segments, each requiring 1 rower and able to carry 150 stone of cargo.

**Sailing Ship:** A sailing ship is a large, seaworthy vessel intended to carry cargo and passengers across the high seas. Compared to galleys, they are much sturdier and have much smaller crews, owing to their lack of oars. That same lack makes them ill-suited to naval warfare, where they are easily outmaneuvered and destroyed.

* *Small:* The small sailing ship is a 75-ton one-masted square-sailed vessel with a 75’ length, 24’ beam, and 5’ draft. It requires 12 sailors to crew and can carry 10,000 stone (100,000 lbs) of cargo. Historical examples include the Roman corbita, the Viking knarr, and the medieval cog.
* *Large:* The large sailing ship is a 200-ton three-masted square-sailed vessel with a 100’ length, 25’ beam, and 10’ draft. It has at least one full deck below the weather deck, and deck castles fore and stern. The forecastle usually contains living quarters for the crew, while the sterncastle contains cabins and mess for the captain and his officers. It requires 20 sailors to crew and can carry 30,000 stone (300,000 lbs) of cargo. It can carry two war machines, one on each deck castle, each weighing up to 800 st each. Historical examples include the Roman cladivata and the medieval round ship.
* *Huge:* The huge sailing ship is a 400-ton three-masted square-sailed vessel with a 115’ length, 33’ beam, and 12’6” draft. It has at least two full decks below the weather deck, and deck castles fore and stern as on the large ship. It requires 40 sailors to crew and can carry 50,000 stone (500,000 lbs) of cargo. It can carry four war machines, two on each deck castle, each weighing up to 1200 st each. Historical examples include the Roman grain freighters of Classical Antiquity.

###### War Machine (Artillery) Descriptions

**Ballista:** A ballista is a two-armed siege weapon, powered either by tension (composite bow) or torsion spring mechanisms, which hurls large spear-like bolts or pellets. Historical examples of light ballista include the Greek oxybeles and Roman scorpio. Historical examples of heavy ballistas include the Roman ballista and medieval springald.

Light and medium ballista can damage creatures or wooden structures, but cannot damage stone. Heavy ballista can damage creatures, wood, and stone.

**Ballista, Heavy Harpoon:** A heavy harpoon ballista is an advanced torsion naval weapon with a large winch fastened to its frame. It fires a 12’ long iron-shod dart with a spiked iron grapnel on one end and a long length of rope on the other. The rope is spooled around the winch before firing. The grapnel dart is fired at enemy vessels, to which it secures itself either by its spike or hooks. The winch is then cranked back, bringing the two ships closed together to enable boarding. Cranking a heavy harpoon ballista’s winch requires a full round action by its crew. The ballista cannot be reloaded during this time. The chief historical example is the Roman harpax.

**Ballista, Repeating:** A repeating ballista is an advanced tension-powered siege weapon that uses a mechanical chain drive to automatically reload its javelin-like bolts into the firing slot after each shot is fired. Historical examples include the Greek polybolos and Roman repeating ballista.

The magazine for the repeating ballista holds 20 bolts. Because of its complexity, a repeating ballista is prone to malfunctions. A malfunction occurs whenever the crew’s attack throw is an unmodified 1. A malfunction takes 1 turn for a siege engineer to repair, during which time the ballista cannot be fired.

**Catapult:** A catapult is a one-armed tension- or torsion-powered siege engine which hurls rocks, burning pitch, or other projectiles from a sling or spoon attached to its throwing arm. Historical examples include the Greek katapeltes, Roman onager and medieval mangonel.

All catapults can damage creatures, wood, and stone. Catapults have difficulty striking small, fast-moving creatures, however. They suffer a -4 penalty to attack throws against man-sized creatures and a -2 penalty to attack throws against large (ogre-sized) creatures. They suffer an additional -1 penalty to attack throws per 10’ of distance the creature has moved this round.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Fuel Remaining | Explosion |
| 5 lbs or less | 1d6 fire in 5’ radius |
| 6 lbs – 89 lbs | 2d6 fire in 10’ radius |
| 90 lbs or more | 3d6 fire in 15’ radius |

**Fire-Bearing Siphon:** A fire-bearing siphon is an advanced naval weapon consisting of a double-cylinder force pump connected by a bronze pipe to a 100 lb bronze reservoir connected to a bronze siphon mounted on a swivel and ending in a narrow nozzle. A lamp is mounted below the nozzle while a brazier is positioned below the reservoir inside a bronze case. To use the device, the reservoir is first filled with military oil while the brazier and lamp are filled with common oil and lit. Some of the crew then begin to impel the force pump to squirt the heated military oil through the bronze siphon and out the nozzle, where it is ignited by the lamp. Another crew member swivels the siphon to direct a 5’ wide stream of flaming oil to a range of 60’. Any vessel in the area of effect automatically takes 5d6 fire damage and is set aflame. The flames burn for 5 rounds, dealing 4d6, 3d6, 2d6, and 1d6 additional fire damage at the end of each subsequent round. In addition, any creature in the area of effect must make a Blast saving throw. If the save fails, the creature takes 1d8 fire damage immediately and another 1d8 fire damage at the end of its next initiative. If the save succeeds, the creature takes 1d3 fire damage. Each attack consumes 5 lbs of military oil (one flask of military oil counts as 1 lb). A fire-bearing siphon cannot be used in rainy conditions. If the siphon is destroyed while the brazier is lit, the military oil within explodes. The damage and radius of the explosion is determined by the remaining fuel. The chief historical example is the Byzantine fire-bearing siphon.

**Trebuchet:** A trebuchet is a one-armed siege engine which hurls rocks, burning pitch, and other projectiles from a sling affixed to a long throwing arm. Historical examples include the Byzantine cheiromangana, and the medieval couillard, brigola, and fenevol. Trebuchets can be powered by traction (via men pulling on the throwing arm) or by gravity (via counterweight mechanisms fixed to the throwing arm). Traction trebuchets are simpler and less expensive (reduce cost by 20%) but counterweight trebuchets are more precise (+2 to attack throws). Trebuchets have the same benefits and drawbacks as catapults when targeting creatures and structures.

###### War Machine (Naval Machine) Descriptions

**Boarding Bridge:** A naval machine designed to allow marines to board an enemy vessel. It consists of a tall mast surmounted by a pulley connected by a swiveling hinge to a 36’ long, 4’ wide gangway with a 2’ tall railing on either side. The upper face has a large iron ring to which the rope leading back to the pull is attached. The bottom face of the end of the gangway is surmounted by a huge iron spike, which fastens the gangway to the deck of the enemy vessel. A boarding bridge weighs 250 st and has AC 1 and 2 shp. Because of its cumbersome weight and height, a boarding bridge imposes a -6 penalty to Seafaring proficiency throws to move in storms. See the **Voyages** chapter (p. XX) for rules on using a boarding bridge in combat. The chief historical example is the Roman corvus.

**Boarding Ramp:** A sturdy 20’ long, 3’ wide wooden gangway designed to allow marines to board an enemy vessel. A boarding ramp weighs 40 st and has AC 0 and 1 shp. It is typically carried by a crew of two man-sized characters. See the **Voyages** chapter (p. XX) for rules on using a boarding ramp in combat.

**Bulwark:** A battlemented extension of a vessel’s hull designed to protect the vessel’s sailors and marines from enemy missile fire. Missile attacks targeting the defenders suffer a -2 penalty, while the defenders gain a +2 bonus to Blast saving throws caused by artillery, burning oil, or similar effects. The bonus does not stack with that afforded by towers. Because it makes the vessel more top-heavy, a bulwark imposes a -2 penalty to Seafaring proficiency throws to move in storms. A bulwark’s cost is 5% of the cost of the vessel onto which it is fitted. A vessel that has been fitted with a bulwark increases its structural hit points by 5%.

**Fire Pot Pole:** An incendiary weapon consisting of 20’ long pole fastened on either side of a vessel’s prow, from which is slung a funnel-shaped pot of burning oil. When an enemy vessel comes within range, the fire pot’s operator twists the pole and dumps fire on the enemy. See the **Voyages** chapter (p. XX) for rules on using a fire pot pole in combat.

**Naval Ram:** A weapon fitted to a galley for use in disabling or sinking enemy vessels. The galley’s bow is extended below the water line, reinforced with heavy timbers, and armored with a bronze casing. A typical ram is 7’5” in length and weighs 1,025 lbs, though the size varies depending on its vessel’s tonnage. A ram’s cost is 10% of the cost of the vessel onto which its fitted.

**Tower, Large:** A defensive structure erected on the deck of a cataphract vessel, it stands 15’ square at its base, with a single door admitting entrance. Inside a ladder leads up 16’ to the rooftop fighting platform, which is surrounded by a 4’ battlement. A large tower’s fighting platform can support up to eight marines or one heavy ballista and crew (400 st total). The height afforded by the tower grants a +1 bonus to attack throws against enemy vessels or marines. The battlement protects the artillery or marines stationed on the fighting platform. Missile attacks targeting the defenders suffer a -4 penalty, while the defenders gain a +4 bonus to Blast saving throws caused by artillery, burning oil, or similar effects. When placed on a vessel, the large tower counts as two war machines each weighing 600 st. It has AC 1 and 6 shp.

**Tower, Small:** A small defensive structure erected on the deck of a cataphract vessel. The tower is 7.5’ square at its base and the fighting platform is elevated to 8’ with a 4’ battlement. A small tower’s fighting platform can mount up to four marines or a light ballista and crew (100 st total). When placed on a vessel, the small tower counts as one war machine weighing 400 st. It has AC 1 and 2 shp. It is otherwise identical to its larger sibling.

###### War Machine (Siege Engine) Descriptions

**Battering Ram:** A siege engine designed to batter down the walls and gates of strongholds. A typical battering ram consists of a 4,000 lb, 20’ long, 2’ diameter iron-shod log with a wedge-shaped metal head. Larger rams can be built at a cost of 10gp per foot of ram. A battering ram must be crewed with 5 man-sized creatures per 5’. A fully-crewed battering ram has a combat speed of 15’ and a charging/running speed of 45’. When the ram is adjacent to a structure, the crew can batter the structure as a combat action. A ram may batter once every other round. Each blow deals 5d4 shp of damage to wooden structures and 1d4 shp of damage to stone structures. A 20’ ram has AC 2 and 4 shp (1 shp per 5’). For rams with variant dimensions, adjust price, shp, and damage proportionately. Rams can be mounted in movable galleries of sufficient size to provide additional protection to the crew.

**Caltrops:** A 20-ounce bag of spiked caltrops. A typical caltrop has four sharp spikes arranged in a tetrahedron so that when thrown one spike always points up. Caltrops are used to impede movement through areas, particularly by cavalry. One bag of caltrops can be scattered across a 5’ x 5’ area as an action in lieu of attacking. One bag of caltrops can be picked up from a 5’ x 5’ area as a full-round action. Caltrops are easy to spot unless shielded by terrain such as tall grass. Creatures moving at half combat speed or less can move through caltrops safely. Creatures moving at combat speed must succeed on a proficiency throw of 7+ per 5’ of movement through caltrops. Mounts must throw twice per 5’. If more than bag of caltrops has been scattered across the area, there is a -2 penalty on the throw per additional bag. If a creature fails the throw, it steps on a caltrop. Stepping on a caltrop deals 1 piercing damage at combat speed or 1d4 piercing damage at running speed. A charging or running mount that steps on a caltrop also falls **prone** and becomes **incapacitated** until the damage is healed. Its rider must succeed on a Paralysis saving throw or be thrown, suffering 1d6 bludgeoning damage from the impact. Characters with both Mounted Combat and Riding proficiency automatically succeed on this save.

**Cauldron, Suspended:** A 50-gallon cast-iron cauldron mounted over a brazier. During sieges, cauldrons are used to heat sand; melt lead; or boil water, wine, or oil, any of which can be poured over walls or through murder holes to inflict grievous wounds on assaulting troops. The crew of a cauldron can use a full-round action to pour burning fluid to affect all creatures in a 10’ diameter area, or all creatures on a siege ladder. Creatures in the area of effect must make Blast saving throws. If the save succeeds, the creature suffers 1d3 fire damage. If the save fails, the creature suffers 1d8 fire damage immediately and another 1d8 fire damage on the same initiative count the following round. The cauldron weighs 4 stone unfilled and 45 stone filled. The crew must be of sufficient size or strength able to lift the cauldron.

**Fascine:** A large bundle of sticks used to reinforce field fortifications, fill up a moat, or make a path across wet terrain. Fascines can be purchased in 5’ x 5’ x 5’ costing 10gp each and weigh 450 st each. Filling a 100’ x 20’ x 10’ moat would require (20,000 / 125) 160 fascines, costing 1,600gp.

**Hoist:** A siege engine used by assaulting troops to ascend to the top of a wall. It consists of a heavy frame supporting a 30’ long arm. One end of the arm has a large basket for transporting up to 4 man-sized creatures at a time, while the other end has a counterweight heavy enough to lift them. With a full crew of 4 laborers working the winch, it takes 1 round for the basket to ascend or descend. It takes 4 rounds to re-set the counterweight in between each ascent. The basket provides partial cover to the ascending creatures. Missile attacks against them suffer a -2 penalty. Hoists can be mounted in movable galleries or siege towers for mobility. The hoist itself has AC 0 and 5 shp.

**Movable Gallery:** A wheeled carriage with a heavy timber frame used to provide cover for troops operating against a wall. Missile attacks targeting creatures within the gallery suffer a -4 penalty, and the creatures gain a +4 bonus to Blast saving throws caused by artillery, burning oil, or similar effects. A typical movable gallery measures 12’ tall, 12’ wide, and 20’ long and can protect 20 man-sized creatures. The gallery itself has AC 1 and 10 shp. A movable gallery can mount a battering ram, hoist, or screw (purchased separately). If at least 10 man-sized creatures occupy the gallery, it can move with a combat speed of 15’ and a charging/running speed of 45’. Galleries can be built at a cost of 1gp per square foot. Historical examples include the Roman tortoise and medieval cat.

**Movable Mantlet:** A thick wooden shield mounted on wheels used to shelter assaulting troops from fire as they move towards the besieged stronghold’s walls. Missile attacks targeting creatures shielded by the mantlet suffer a -4 penalty, and the creatures gain a +4 bonus to Blast saving throws caused by artillery, burning oil, or similar effects. A typical movable mantlet measures 8’ tall by 6’ wide and can protect 2 man-sized creatures, who can move it at a combat speed of 15’ and a charging/running speed of 45’. The mantlet itself has AC 1 and 1 shp. The shield of the mantlet features slits to allow archery fire. Historical examples include the medieval mantlet and Mughal turah.

**Petard:** A crude bomb used to breach stronghold walls. Petards have a slow fuse that must be lit with a match, a risky proposition. Lighting the fuse requires a Siege Engineering proficiency throw of 6+. A successful throw indicates the petard will detonate in 1d4 rounds. A failed throw indicates the fuse has not been lit. A fumble occurs if the proficiency throw is an unmodified 1. A fumble results in the immediate detonation of the petard. When detonated, a 1 lb petard does 1d6 seismic damage to all creatures with 5’. A 6 lb petard deals 2d6 seismic damage to all creatures within 10’. An 18 lb petard deals 3d6 seismic damage to all creatures within 15’. A 40 lb petard deals 4d6 seismic damage to all creatures within 20’. Creatures may make a Blast saving throw to reduce the damage by half. Petards also deal full damage to the structural hit points of ships and buildings. In the Auran Empire campaign setting, only the magic-wary dwarves make and use petards, so they can only be purchased in dwarven vaults.

**Ram Catcher:** Asiege engine used to lift, break, or dislodge battering rams, siege hooks, or screws from the walls. The device consists of a grappling hook mounted at the end of a long beam or thick rope. To use a ram catcher, its wielder must succeed on an attack throw against the ram with a -4 penalty. The ram must then make a successful Paralysis saving throw. (A ram or other crewed engine always saves as the lowest level member of its crew.) If the saving throw fails, the ram is dislodged and takes 1d6 shp of damage.

**Screw:** A siege engine designed to bore a hole into a stronghold’s walls. A typical screw consists of a 20’ long iron-shod log with a screw or bore head affixed to the tip. Larger screws can be built at a cost of 10gp per foot. A screw must be crewed with 2-5 man-sized creatures per 5’. A fully-crewed battering ram has a combat speed of 15’ and a charging/running speed of 45’. Once brought adjacent to a structure, the screw can start boring into the structure. A screw bores once every other round. Each bore deals 3d10 shp of damage to wooden structures and 1d4+1 shp of damage to stone structures. A 20’ bore has AC 2 and 4 shp (1 shp per 5’). For bores with variant dimensions, adjust price, shp, and damage proportionately. Screws can be mounted in movable galleries of sufficient size to provide additional protection to the crew. Historical examples include the bore, pick, and sow.

**Siege Hook:** A siege engine designed to pull defenders from a wall during a siege. It consists of a long wooden beam mounted with a sickle-shaped blade. To use a siege hook, its wielder must succeed on an attack throw against the target creature with a -4 penalty. (The attack throw must also be modified by any cover the target enjoys from battlements, etc.) The target creature must then make a successful Paralysis saving throw. If the saving throw fails, the creature is knocked off the wall, and suffers 1d6 bludgeoning damage per 10’ fallen.

**Siege Ladder:** A ladder used by assaulting troops to scale a stronghold’s walls or ramparts, an act known as escalade. Most siege ladders are simply long pieces of timber with crosspieces set upon them. Creatures may move up siege ladders at one quarter their normal speed. A creature defending the walls can push a siege ladder away with a successful proficiency throw to open doors. Each man-sized creature on the ladder imposes a -1 penalty to the proficiency throw.

**Siege Tower:** A mobile tower designed to protect assaulting troops during the approach to a stronghold, then get them over the walls by means of a gangplank or hoist. A siege tower consists of a multi-story wooden frame built over a huge carriage with wheels mounted in casters. The frame is then covered with iron or animal skins to protect it from flame. Missile attacks targeting creatures within the siege tower suffer a -4 penalty, and the creatures gain a +4 bonus to saving throws versus Blast caused by artillery, burning oil, or similar effects. If properly crewed, a siege tower can be moved (as a full-round action by its crew) 20’ per round.

A standard siege tower is 20’ square at the base. It has four stories, at 10’, 20’, 30’, and 40’ in height. The top floor, at 40’ height, is surrounded by a 10’ square parapet. The third floor, at 30’ height, features a 10’ drawbridge. The second and first floor are at 10’ and 20’ height respectively. Each floor can carry siege engine and crew weighing up to 400 st. Beneath the first floor is a capstan where a crew of 12 man-sized creatures pushes the tower. In addition, a standard siege tower can carry 60 man-sized troops.

A large siege tower is 40’ square at the base. It has six stories, at 15’, 30’, 45’, 60’, 75’, and 90’. The top floor, at 90’ height, is surrounded by a 20’ square parapet. The fifth floor, at 75’ height, features a 10’ drawbridge. Each floor can carry up to two siege engines with crew weighing up to 800 st total. Beneath the first floor is a capstan where a crew of 60 man-sized creatures pushes the tower. In addition, a large siege tower can carry up to 360 man-sized troops. Historical examples of large siege towers include the Roman towers used at Masada.

A huge siege tower is 65’ square at the base. It has nine stories, at 15’, 30’, 45’, 60’, 75’, 90’, 105’, 120’, and 135’. The top floor, at 135’ height, is surrounded by a 30’ square parapet. The fifth floor, at 75’, features a 10’ drawbridge. Each floor can carry up to four siege engines with crew weighing up to 1600 st total. The capstan below the first floor requires a crew of 200 man-sized creatures to push the tower. In addition, a huge siege tower can carry up to 1,080 man-sized troops. A historical example of a huge tower is Helepolis (“City Taker”), used by Demetrius during the siege of Rhodes.

Siege towers all require a large number of external crew to move the tower. A small siege tower requires 108 external crew. A large siege tower requires 420 external crew. A huge siege tower requires 1,000 external crew. External crew generally stand outside the tower and pull it with ropes. If available, draft animals or exotic creatures can substitute for external crew. For every 10 stone of normal load, the creature counts as 1 external crew.

EXAMPLE: An ox or heavy draft horse (normal load 40 stone) can substitute for 4 external crew. A medium draft horse (normal load 30 stone) can substitute for 3 external crew. A mule (normal load 20 stone) can substitute for 2 external crew. If a trained giant tiger beetle (normal load 250 stone) were available, it could substitute for 25 external crew!

## Masterwork Equipment (Optional)

Working alone or with his subordinates, a grand master in an art or craft can create **masterwork items** appropriate to his art or craft. Such items can be nearly magical in their effectiveness.

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Item | Cost | Item | Cost |
| Masterwork Weapon (+1 to attack throw) | +80gp | Masterwork Structure (+1 AC) | x2 |
| Masterwork Weapon (+1 to damage) | +80gp | Masterwork Structure (+10% shp) | x2 |
| Masterwork Weapon (+1 to damage & attack throw) | +650gp | Masterwork Structure (+1 AC & +10% shp) | x4 |
| Masterwork Armor (-1 stone weight) | +80gp | Masterwork Ship (+1 AC) | x2 |
| Masterwork Armor (+1 AC) | +650gp | Masterwork Ship (+10% shp) | x2 |
| Masterwork Instrument (+1 Performance) | +80gp | Masterwork Ship (+10% speed) | x2 |
| Masterwork Instrument (+2 Performance) | +650gp | Masterwork Ship (+1 AC, +10% shp & speed) | x8 |

**Masterwork Weapon:** A masterwork weapon costing an additional 80gp can provide +1 to hit or +1 to damage. A masterwork weapon costing an additional 650gp can provide both +1 to hit and damage. In neither case does the weapon provide the ability to hit magical monsters, unless forged of a material otherwise capable of doing so (e.g. silver). Additional ornaments or engraving can add to the weapon’s value without necessarily increasing the weapon’s characteristics.

**Masterwork Armor:** A masterwork set of armor costing an additional 80gp weighs one less stone (armor or shields weighing one stone count as one item instead) while providing normal AC. A masterwork set of armor costing an additional 650gp provides +1 AC while weighing the same as normal. Additional ornaments or engraving can add to the value without necessarily improving the armor’s characteristics.

**Masterwork Instrument:** A masterwork instrument costing an additional 80gp adds +1 to Performance throws. A masterwork instrument costing an additional 650gp adds +2 to Performance throws.

**Masterwork Structures:** A masterwork structure costing 2 times normal gains +1 to AC or +10% to structural hit points. A masterwork structure costing 4 times normal gains both +1 to AC and +10% to structural hit points.

**Masterwork Ship:** A masterwork ship costing 2 times normal gains +1 to AC, +10% to structural hit points, or +10% to speed. A masterwork ship costing 4 times normal gains any two such benefits. A masterwork ship costing 8 times normal gains all three such benefits.

In addition to the above, a miscellaneous piece of masterwork art or craftsmanship may be of such beauty and quality as to be worth anywhere from 2 to 100 times normal value.

###### Availability of Masterwork Items

Check with your Judge before purchasing masterwork items. Their availability is at his discretion based on the particulars of his campaign setting. Because grandmasters are very rare, masterwork items might be absent from even large markets where they’d otherwise be available based on gp cost. For instance, in the ***AX3:*** ***Capital of the Borderlands***sourcebook, masterwork items are only available from specific in-game merchants that characters must befriend.

###### Masterwork and Magical Items

The process of making a weapon, shield or set of armor into a +1 or greater item automatically transforms it into a masterwork, so the bonuses do not stack. However, enchanting masterworks is easier than enchanting mundane items. Apply the value of the masterwork item towards the material cost of the item (see p. XX).

## Scavenged Equipment

Poor or low level adventurers may be so desperate for treasure that they scavenge weapons, armor, or other equipment rotting in dungeons, littering old battlefields, or equipping slain foes. These items are almost universally in bad repair. Roll 1d20 on the following tables to determine the condition and value of any equipment scavenged. Effects are cumulative. Scavenged items can be sold in markets in volumes determined by their actual (reduced) value.

| 11 – 14 | Fragile | -1 AC, -10% shp | -33% |
| 15 – 16 | Rotting | -1 AC, -10% shp | -33% |

| 19 – 20 | Roll again twice | - | - |

Re-roll results that are irrelevant to the item. Damage penalties cannot reduce weapon damage to less than 1 point. Armor Class or attack throw penalties cannot be worse than -5. Weapons and equipment susceptible to breaks will be destroyed if the character rolls an unmodified 1 when using the item. Shoddy long weapons break on 1 – 3.

EXAMPLE: Marcus scavenges a sword from an ancient battlefield. He rolls a 19, and must roll twice more. He rolls a 7 and 15. The sword has a rusty blade and loose hilt, and imposes penalties of -1 damage and -1 initiative. Its value is reduced 66%, to 3gp, when he tries to sell it.

## Encumbrance and Equipment

**Encumbrance** measures how much equipment and treasure characters are carrying. Encumbrance is important because characters can only carry so much, and if they are heavily weighed down with equipment they cannot carry as much treasure, nor move as fast. Encumbrance is measured in **stone**. A stone is a historical unit of measure that varied from 8 to 14 lbs depending on what was being measured. ***ACKS***assumes a stone weighs around 10 lbs, but it is left purposefully abstract to represent an amalgam of weight, bulk, and generally portability. Most items have an encumbrance of 1/6 of a stone; that is, six items count as one stone. See **Speed and Encumbrance** in Chapter 1 for a full discussion of the impact of encumbrance on speed.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Item | Encumbrance in Stone |
| Worn clothing | 0 stone |
| Armor | 1 stone per point of AC |
| Shield | 1 stone per shield |
| Typical Item | 1 stone per 6 items |
| Heavy Item | 1 stone or more |
| Treasure | 1 stone per 1,000 coins or gems |

When counting items, each weapon, scroll, potion, vial, wand, magic item, or other object counts as an item. Multiple small items sold as a bundle (such as 6 spikes, 6 torches, 20 arrows, etc.) count as one item for this purpose. Very small single items (such as 1 silver arrow) can be ignored for encumbrance purposes, but if carried in number should be counted as 1 item. (No, a character cannot buy 20 silver arrows and have no encumbrance.)

Heavy items generally include any large melee weapon; any item that is more than two-thirds as tall as the carrying character (including composite bows, long bows, spears, staffs, and 10’ poles); any item that weighs 8lbs or more; and any item that requires two hands to carry (such as chairs or chests). Items weighing more than 14lb will weigh more than 1 stone.

For purposes of encumbrance, 1,000 coins are considered 1 stone. When a carrying device, such as a backpack, lists the weight it can carry in stone, this weight can be converted at 1:1000 from stone to coins to determine how many coins it can carry.

In order to carry more equipment and treasure, characters can purchase beasts of burdens and ground vehicles. Each animal or vehicle has a normal and maximum load it can carry in stone, as shown on the Animal/Vehicle Speed and Encumbrance table. The figure to the left of the slash is the animal or vehicle’s speed per turn when not encumbered (carrying its normal load limit or less), and the figure to the right of the slash is its speed per turn when encumbered (carrying more than a normal load but not more than a maximum load).

For purposes of carrying capacity, a man-sized humanoid is assumed to weigh 15 stone (about 120 – 210 lbs). Carried or worn equipment adds to this weight. For instance, a cavalry soldier with a spear (1 stone), shield (1 stone), and leather armor (2 stone) would impose 19 stone of encumbrance on his mount.

Remember that wheeled vehicles can only move through deserts, mountains, forests, or swamps if a road is available. However, when a character with Driving proficiency drives a wheeled vehicle on a road or trail, the movement bonus from the road is increased to 2x. (A proficient driver in a cart or wagon can thus travel about 24 miles per day, averaging 3 miles per hour.)

## Hirelings, Henchmen, Mercenaries, and Specialists

In addition to buying equipment, adventurers may also spend their money to hire various NPCs, known as **hirelings**,to assist them. There are three types of hirelings. **Henchmen** are NPC sidekicks, companions, and associates. Henchmen are typically very loyal and are willing to take reasonable risks; in particular, they are the only sort of hireling who will generally accompany an adventurer into a dungeon, lair, or ruin. **Mercenaries** are hired soldiers, and will guard, patrol, and otherwise serve in wilderness settings, but only as part of a larger force, not an adventuring party. **Specialists** are hired individuals who have a particular trade or who have special knowledge; they will rarely go on adventures at all unless it is directly related to their specialty. **Followers** are a special type of hireling that only becomes available to characters of 9th level or higher who have established a stronghold (see p. XX). Followers will undertake the same tasks as henchmen.

While adventurers often wish to hire as many hirelings as they can afford, hirelings are not available in unlimited numbers. Indeed, in small villages or remote outposts, they may not be available at all. As with equipment, the amount available will be determined by the **market class** within which the adventurers are recruiting hirelings. The **Hireling Availability by Market Class** tables shows how many of each type of henchman, mercenary or specialist is available in each type of market, and at what wage. Some values will indicate a percentage chance; this is the chance of that level of hireling being present at all. One half of the hirelings (rounded up) become available within the first week the adventurers enter the market. One quarter (rounded down, minimum 1) become available during the second week. The remainder of the hirelings become available in the third week.

EXAMPLE: Marcus is in Cyfaraun, a city of 20,000 (Class III market). He wants to hire a sage and some heavy infantry. There is a 65% chance of 1 sage being present; unfortunately, the Judge rolls a 98, and Marcus can’t find one available. His search for the heavy infantry goes better, as the Judge’s roll of 3d8 yields 22. Marcus finds 11 of these in his first week of searching, 5 more in his second week, and the remaining 6 in his third week.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Market**  **Class** | **Cost Per Week**  **Per Hireling Type** |
| I | 1d6+15gp |
| II | 1d10+10gp |
| III | 1d8+5gp |
| IV | 1d6+3gp |
| V | 1d6gp |
| VI | 1d3gp |

PCs might sometimes find potential hirelings while on adventures. Otherwise, in order to find hirelings, the PCs must carouse in pubs, post notices of help wanted, hand out fliers, and seek out adventuring companies, mercenary brotherhoods, or professional guilds. These count as ancillary activities and cost money. Each week that the adventurers are in the market for hirelings, they must pay the fee listed on the adjoining table. This fee is per specific type of hireling, i.e. each type of mercenary or specialist.

### Recruiting Hirelings

Hirelings are recruited through negotiation. The Judge plays the roles of the NPCs the PCs attempt to hire. Henchmen are typically hired for a half-share of treasure found and a monthly wage for food, lodging and expenses (based on level, see below). Mercenaries and specialists are typically hired for a flat monthly wage, which varies depending on the type of specialist or mercenary (see below). Mercenaries will expect spoils of war after battles and sieges. Henchmen, mercenaries, and specialists will have equipment appropriate to their profession, class, or level. Adventurers may provide additional equipment to their hirelings.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Reaction to Hiring Offer** | |
| **Adjusted Die Roll** | **Result** |
| 2- | Refuse and slander |
| 3 – 5 | Refuse |
| 6 – 8 | Try Again |
| 9 – 11 | Accept |
| 12+ | Accept with élan |

After the offers are made, the Judge will make a **reaction roll** of 2d6 on the Reaction to Hiring Offer table to decide the potential hireling’s reactions, modified by the prospective employer’s Charisma bonus or penalty. If proficient, the prospective employer can use Diplomacy, Intimidation, Mystic Aura, and/or Seduction to persuade the hireling to join. The prospective employer can also offer a signing bonus. A signing bonus worth one week’s pay for the hireling grants a +1 bonus; a month’s pay provides a +2 bonus, and a year’s pay provides a +3 bonus on the reaction roll. (A prospective employer with Bribing proficiency can use it when offering a signing bonus without risk of being charged with a crime.) The Judge might apply any other adjustments he feels are appropriate based on the circumstances.

**Refuse and slander** means that all further reaction rolls made towards that adventurer in the given town or region will be at a penalty of -1 due to unkind words said by the NPC to his fellows. If the adventurer tries again in a different town, the penalty does not apply. **Refuse** simply means the NPC declines the offer.

If a **Try again** result is rolled, the potential hireling is reluctant, and needs more convincing; the adventurer must “sweeten the deal” in order to get an additional roll, such as by offering more pay, a magic item, or other appealing suggestion. If the adventurer makes no better offer, treat **Try again** as a **Refusal** result.

**Accept** means that the NPC has agreed to become the character’s hireling for the stated terms. **Accept with élan** means the offer is accepted with very good spirit, and the hireling gains a +1 bonus to his loyalty score.

###### Recruiting After a Failed Attempt

Sometimes an adventurer will attempt to recruit a hireling that just rejected the employment offer of one or more other adventurer(s) in the same party. The following rules apply:

* Each subsequent attempt suffers a cumulative -1 penalty, representing the hireling’s growing contempt for the “desperate” party attempting to hire him.
* If any of the attempts ever result in a reaction of refuse and slander, no further attempts can be made to recruit that hireling by any adventurer in the party.

From time to time, enterprising adventurers might try to pretend “not to know each other” in order to avoid the penalties for making multiple attempts to recruit a hireling into the same party. Nothing precludes this, but if and when the hireling discovers he has unknowingly hired into comradeship with someone who he had previously rejected, it counts as a calamity (see p. XX).

###### Transferring Employment of a Hireling

Sometimes a hireling might be recruited into a party by one adventurer (e.g. one with high CHA) with the intent that that the hireling will actually be employed by another adventurer in the party. At other times a hireling might be recruited into a party by one adventurer and then later transferred to a different adventurer’s employment, perhaps due to the death or incapacity of the original employer, perhaps so that the original employer can hire a new henchman, etc.

When a hireling is transferred from the employ of one adventurer to another in the same party, the hireling’s loyalty and morale scores are immediately recalculated based on the Charisma, proficiencies, and class powers of the hireling’s new employer. The transfer then counts as a calamity (p. XX).

### Morale and Loyalty

Every hireling has a **morale score** and a **loyalty score**.Morale is a hireling’s confidence in battle. Loyalty is a hireling’s fidelity to his employer. A hireling can have a high morale but low loyalty — a treacherous berserker, for example, might have +4 morale (he would never flee in combat) but -4 loyalty (he’d betray his employer). A hireling can also have a high loyalty and low morale. For instance, a cowardly accountant might be impossible to bribe and committed to lifetime service to his employer, but he’d flee at the merest sight of a beastman.

###### Loyalty

Loyalty can range from -4 to +4. Most henchmen, mercenaries, specialists, and followers begin with a loyalty of 0. Bladedancer and crusader followers begin with a loyalty score of +4. Mercenary officers (but not troops) begin with a loyalty of -2. Ruffians have a loyalty of -2 unless they are members of their employer’s syndicate (see p. XX). Creatures forced into servitude begin with loyalty scores of -4. The loyalty score is then modified by the employer’s Charisma modifier. Add +1 if the employer has the Blood of Ancient Kings class power and add +1 if the hireling rolled “Accept with élan” on his Reaction to Hiring roll. Over time, a hireling’s loyalty score will change based on how he fares in the adventurer’s employ:

* +1 permanent increase each time the employer rolls Fanatic Loyalty on a Hireling Loyalty roll.
* -1 permanent decrease each time the employer rolls Grudging Loyalty on a Hireling Loyalty roll.
* +1 permanent increase each time the hireling gains a level while in the employer’s service.
* -1 permanent decrease each time the hireling suffers a calamity while in the employer’s service.
* -1 decrease each time the hireling suffers a permanent wound from being critically wounded until cured or compensated.
* -2 decrease each time the hireling suffers a permanent wound from being grievously wounded until cured or compensated.
* -3 decrease each time the hireling suffers a permanent wound from being mortally wounded until cured or compensated.
* -1 permanent decrease each time the hireling suffers a moderate side effect from tampering with mortality.
* -2 permanent decrease each time the hireling suffers a major side effect from tampering with mortality.
* -2 permanent decrease each time other hirelings in the adventurer’s employ are incapacitated or killed and are not magically restored even though funds were available to do so.

A calamity occurs anytime a hireling has to go without rations or wages; suffers an enervation, curse, or magical disease; is reduced to 0 hp or less; or other similarly dire outcomes (Judge’s discretion).

A hireling must make a roll on the Hireling Loyalty table each time he suffers a calamity and each time he advances in experience level. The Judge secretly rolls 2d6 and adds the hireling’s loyalty score to decide how the henchman responds to the recent events. The Judge might apply adjustments to this roll, probably no more than ±2, depending on the circumstances.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Hireling Loyalty** | |
| **Adjusted Die Roll (2d6)** | **Result** |
| 2- | Hostility |
| 3 – 5 | Resignation |
| 6 – 8 | Grudging Loyalty |
| 9 – 11 | Loyalty |
| 12+ | Fanatic Loyalty |

**Hostility** means that the hireling immediately leaves the service of the employer, and will consider him a rival and enemy in the future. The hireling can never be attracted to the character’s employ again. A result of **Resignation** means the hireling immediately leaves the character’s employment, but he bears no especially ill will to his former employer, and could be recruited to work for the character again in the future.

**Grudging Loyalty** means the hireling is reluctant to continue in the employer’s service, but sees no better options. The hireling’s loyalty score is reduced by 1. **Loyalty** means that hireling will continue in the character’s service with enthusiasm. **Fanatic Loyalty** means hireling has become a dedicated and sworn servant of the character. His loyalty score increases by +1.

Regardless of modifiers, an unmodified roll of 2 is never better than Resignation, and an unmodified result of 12 is never worse than Loyalty.

###### Morale

Morale can range from -4 to +4. Hirelings begin with a Morale based on their specialty, class, and level. Most specialists have a morale score of -2, but rowers and sailors have morale of -1; navigators, captains, and scouts have morale 0; and marshals, master mariners, and mercenary officers have morale +1. Mercenaries have a morale score of -1 to +2. Henchmen have a morale score equivalent to a mercenary with similar equipment; if capable of casting spells, their minimum morale score is 0. Bladedancer and crusader followers have a Morale score of +4. Additional modifiers can apply to Morale score, including:

* A permanent +1 bonus to morale score when a 0th-level hireling gains his first experience level (or additional HD)
* A permanent +1 bonus to morale score when a hireling gains his 5th experience level or HD.
* A permanent +1 bonus to morale score for conscripts levied from domains with Steadfast or Stalwart morale (see p. XX).
* A permanent -1 penalty to morale score for conscripts levied from domains with Apathetic or Demoralized domain morale.
* A temporary -3 to +3 modifier to morale Score when personally lead by a character with a Charisma bonus or penalty.
* A temporary +2 bonus to morale score when personally led by a character with Command proficiency.
* A temporary +1 bonus to morale score when personally led by a character of 5th level or higher in appropriate circumstances.
* A temporary +1 bonus to morale score when subject toInspire Courage*, holy blessing,* and other effects.

The combined total of a character’s modifier to his hireling’s morale scores is referred to as his **morale modifier** and plays a major role in warfare (p. XX).

From time to time, the Judge might require a hireling to roll on the Hireling Obedience table. A roll might be required if the hireling is ordered to go on an expedition into unexplored wilderness hexes; ordered to enter a dungeon the party has not entered before; asked to personally perform a notably dangerous task; asked to work overtime in an urban settlement; or other circumstances. No roll should be required for routine tasks such as travel in civilized areas, standing guard, etc. The Judge secretly rolls 2d6 and adds the hireling’s morale score to decide how the hireling responds.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Hireling Obedience | |
| Adjusted Die Roll (2d6) | **Result** |
| 2- | Refuses |
| 3 – 5 | Begrudging |
| 6+ | Compliant |

**Refuses** means thatthe hireling is unwilling to follow orders. If the employer insists, permanently reduce the hireling’s loyalty score by 1, then roll again on Hireling Obedience. **Begrudging** means the hireling carries out the task with the minimum of enthusiasm. He complains, sighs, bitches, and moans. If begrudging a journey or dungeon, he suffers a -1 penalty to any loyalty rolls for that arise due to the adventure. If begrudging a specific task in a dungeon, he suffers a -1 penalty to proficiency throws on the task and ceases the activity after one turn (10 minutes) unless ordered to continue. If asked to work overtime in a settlement, his productivity is reduced by one proficiency rank or one class level, whichever is worse, and he ceases the activity after a work-week unless ordered to continue. **Compliant** meansthat the hireling carries out the task to the best of his ability. Hireling Obedience rolls do not automatically fail on an unmodified 2, so a +4 or higher modifier is sufficient to guarantee orders are carried out.

At his discretion, the Judge might apply situational modifiers to the roll. Examples of possible modifiers are listed below.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Situation | Modifier |
| +2 | Employer personally doing task, dungeon, journey, or work alongside hireling |
| +1 | Adventurer other than employer doing task, dungeon, journey, or work alongside hireling |
| +0 | Other hirelings doing task, dungeon, journey, or work alongside hireling |
| -1 | Hireling doing task, dungeon, journey, or work alone |
| +2 | Task is customary for hireling’s profession or class (e.g. search for traps for thief, bash door for fighter) |
| +0 | Task exposes hireling to small risk similar to what others in party face |
| -1 | One or more henchmen were incapacitated, killed, or captured in the last month or most recent adventure |
| -1 | Task exposes hireling to more risk than what others in party face |
| -2 | Task exposes hireling to great risk of life and limb that others in party are not exposed to |
| -5 | Task exposes hireling to extraordinary risk of incapacitation, death, capture, etc. |
| -5 | Hireling is a mercenary ordered to undertake adventuring activities outside the norm |

Hirelings might also have to make morale rolls when they lose a substantial amount of hp in combat or the party as a whole suffers severe casualties or shocks. See p. XX for more details.

### Henchmen

Henchmen should be rolled up with attributes, classes, hit points, and equipment, just like player characters. Henchmen are typically paid a monthly fee for food, lodging and expenses as well as a half-share of any treasure discovered on an adventure. A henchmen’s monthly fee is based on his level, as noted on the Henchmen Monthly Wage table, below. A henchman who is given a domain to rule as a vassal does not need to be paid a wage if the domain income is equal to or greater than his wage. However, he will thereafter only adventure with his lord when called to council (p. XX).

EXAMPLE: An adventuring party has just recovered 4,000gp in treasure. The party consists of Norden (a player character), Elaria (a PC), Caleför (a PC), and Caleför’s two henchmen, Drakima and Zelicus. Each adventurer gets a full share of treasure, while each henchman gets a half-share. The treasure is therefore divided among 4 shares, with Norden, Elaria, and Caleför each getting 1,000gp and Drakima and Zelicus each getting 500gp.

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Henchmen Monthly Wage** | | | |
| **Class Level** | **Monthly Wage (gp)** | **Class Level** | **Monthly Wage (gp)** |
| 0 | 12 | 8 | 3,000 |
| 1 | 25 | 9 | 7,250 |
| 2 | 50 | 10 | 12,000 |
| 3 | 100 | 11 | 32,000 |
| 4 | 200 | 12 | 50,000 |
| 5 | 400 | 13 | 135,000 |
| 6 | 800 | 14 | 350,000 |
| 7 | 1,600 |  |  |

A 1st level employer can only hire 0th level henchmen. A 2nd level employer can hire 0th or 1st level henchmen. A 3rd or 4th level employer can hire henchmen of up to 2nd level. A 5th or 6th level character can hire henchmen of up to 3rd level. A 7th level or higher employer can hire henchmen of up to 4th level, plus one henchman level per employer level above 7th. (Henchmen of greater than 4th level are not generally for hire on the market, but they can sometimes be found on adventures.) The foregoing notwithstanding, a domain ruler can hire henchmen of any level below his own.

If there is no way for henchmen to directly know the level of the PC employer, they will use the employer’s appearance and living expenses as evidence for his level. Profligate adventurers might be able to fool a powerful henchman into working for them. However, if a henchman ever concludes he is more powerful than his employer, it is cause for an immediate Hireling Loyalty roll (q.v.) at a penalty of -1 per apparent difference in level.

A player character may hire at most 4 henchmen, adjusted by the character’s Charisma bonus or penalty and certain class powers and proficiencies. Any attempts to hire more than this number of henchmen will cause the character to lose one of his existing henchmen. Mercenaries, specialists, and followers do not count towards a character’s maximum number of henchmen, since they do not require the same level of personal loyalty.

It is not the intent of ***ACKS***that henchmen be treated as “extra player characters.” A henchman is an ally and friend of the character, not an extension of the player. It is up to the Judge to decide the extent to which a player directly controls his character’s henchmen at any moment. Allowing the player to control his character’s henchmen is usually convenient, but that convenience does not reflect the reality of the game world, in which the henchman is an independent individual and the player character has limited ability to order them around. Therefore, in some circumstances, another player should be given control of henchmen, or the Judge should control them. In particular, some players will purposefully bring lots of henchmen on adventures in a deliberate attempt to “monopolize the spotlight.” This is both unrealistic within the game world, unfair to the other players, and detrimental to speed of play. In such circumstances, the Judge should allocate control of those henchmen to other players or direct them himself. Judges interested in how the designer handles this issue can watch the Grey Brotherhood Actual Play series on YouTube.

Henchmen gain experience when they participate in an adventure; however, as they are under the command of a player character, only one-half of a share of XP is allocated to each henchman. See **Earning Experience from Adventures** for more information.

Henchmen cannot themselves have henchmen unless they rule domains appropriate to their level. A domain is appropriate to their level if monthly domain income is at least equal to 50% of their wage. With Judge’s approval, mercantile income or army command can substitute for land. Income from a domain provided by his employer counts against a henchman’s monthly wage.

### Mercenaries

Mercenaries are generally hired to garrison a stronghold or wage war in military campaigns. Mercenaries are not adventurers and attempting to use them as such usually ends in calamity. The Judge will determine what constitutes a military campaign and what constitutes an adventure depending on the overall circumstances. In general:

* Mercenaries will accompany adventurers on wilderness expeditions or sea journeys in settled territory and/or along established trade routes that pass through unsettled territory. They will not assist in searching unsettled territory around the trade route for monster lairs unless personally led, however.
* Mercenaries will accompany adventurers on wilderness expeditions or sea journeys into unsettled territory if on a campaign towards a known military or mercantile objective likely to yield substantial benefit for the mercenaries (“save your homeland” “get rich” etc.). They will not assist in searching the unsettled territory en route unless personally led, however.
* Mercenaries will accompany explorers (including NPC scout specialists) on wilderness expeditions into unsettled territory provided the explorers and mercenaries are under orders to evade all encounters, to a max of one platoon per explorer.
* Mercenaries will not accompany adventurers on wilderness expeditions or sea journeys into unsettled territory in other circumstances unless personally lead.
* Mercenaries will not accompany adventurers on dungeon delves, even if personally led. However, they will participate in sieges and assaults on dungeons if present in sufficient numbers to entirely blockade the dungeon or if personally led.
* Mercenaries count as personally lead if each platoon (30 infantry or 15 cavalry) has an adventurer or henchman of at least 3rd level serving as its lieutenant.

The Mercenary Troop Type table below list the typical wages, equipment, and morale of mercenaries based on type. In addition to the weapons and armor noted for their troop type, all mercenaries have the following equipment: military tunic, cloak, pair of sandals, backpack, laborer’s tools, 4 stakes and mallet, mess kit, small tent, 2 wool blankets, and a waterskin. Cavalry mercenaries will also have a saddle, bridle, 2 saddlebags, and grooming kit. Missile-armed mercenaries will have 20 rounds of ammunition.

The costs listed are the mercenaries’ wages only. The cost of armorers to make and repair troop armor and weapons, stablehands to groom horses, caravans to provide supplies while in the field, and other miscellaneous expenses are not included. Mercenaries in garrison need only be paid their wages, but mercenaries on campaign must be provided with supplies and will expect a share of military plunder in addition to wages. See **Armies** (p. XX) and **Maneuvers** (p. XX) for more troop types and advanced rules. Morale scores are for human troops. Demi-human morale will be 1 point higher.

### Specialists

Hundreds of different types of specialist exist in civilized realms; the list below is not exhaustive, and the Judge may create more kinds of specialists as needed using the rules in the **Proficiencies** chapter. Player characters with appropriate **proficiencies** may act as specialists if desired.

**Alchemist** (250gp/month): Alchemists are valuable specialists because they dedicate their expertise to creating potions and other concoctions. An alchemist can identify common alchemical substances by aroma and color in one round with a proficiency throw of 3+. He can attempt to identify which parts of a monster are special components with a proficiency throw of 7+. He can also attempt to extract toxin from poisonous plants. Each attempt requires one day and a proficiency throw of 12+ for fresh plants and 16+ for dried plants. If the throw succeeds, the alchemist extracts one dose of poison. If the throw fails, the alchemist accidentally spoils the plants. If the throw fails on an unmodified 1, the alchemist has accidentally exposed himself to the toxin and must immediately make a successful Poison save or suffers its effects. He can brew potions as if he were a 5th level mage. See **Magic Research** in Chapter 8 (p. XX).

**Animal Trainer** (domestic animals, 25gp/month; wild animals, 75gp/month; dire, giant or prehistoric animals 150gp/month; monstrosities or vermin, 250/gp month): Animal trainers knows how to tame and train animals of various sorts. The most common and least expensive animal trainers are those that can train domesticated animals such as dogs or horses. Less common and more expensive are animal trainers who can train wild animals, giant or prehistoric animals, or even bestial monstrosities. Basic rules for training animals can be found in the Proficiencies section (p. XX) and advanced rules can be found in other sourcebooks such as ***Lairs & Encounters*** or the ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual***.

**Armorer** (master, 75gp/month; journeyman, 20gp/month; apprentice, 10gp/month): Each month, a master armorer can make 40gp worth of weapons, armor, or shields. In addition to being hired for producing weapons and armor, armorers can maintain and fix the armor and weapons of one company of 120 infantry or 60 cavalry troops in the field. Master armorers can be assisted by up to two journeymen (20gp/month) and four apprentices (10gp/ month). Two journeymen and four apprentices will be available in the market for every master armorer. An armorer with two journeymen and four apprentices produces 160gp per month and can maintain one battalion of 480 infantry or 240 cavalry troops in the field. An army in the field without a sufficient number of armorers will require the disgruntled troops to do the work themselves. The loyalty of the army is reduced by 1 until an appropriate staff of armorers is hired.

**Artisan** (master, 75gp/month; journeyman, 20gp/month; apprentice, 10gp/month): Artisans are artists and crafters who make goods for sale. The type of goods created will vary by the artisan’s Art/Craft proficiency (p. XX). Artisans are divided into common, uncommon, and rare. Common artisans manufacture essential goods; examples include blacksmiths, brewers, candlemakers, clothmakers, potters, spinners, tailors, and tanners. Uncommon artisans manufacture non-essential but common goods; examples include bakers, confectioners, glassworkers, hornworkers, saddlers, and toymakers. Rare artisans manufacture exclusive or expensive goods; examples include bookbinders, gemcutters, jewelers, silversmiths, and shipwrights. Two journeymen and four apprentices will be available in the market for every master artisan. Artisans produce goods of their type at the same rate as armorers (above).

**Designer’s Note:** Grandmasters (NPCs with four ranks of an Art/Craft proficiency) never randomly appear in markets. They will only be present in settlements where they have been specifically placed by the Judge.

**Artillerist** (25gp/month): Leaders wishing to employ siege artillery such as ballistae, catapults, and trebuchets will need to employ artillerists. Each artillerist can oversee a battery of 3 – 5 pieces of artillery. See Siege Engineering proficiency (p. XX) and War Machines — Artillery (p. XX).

**Copyist** (1 gp/page): A copyist is a skilled scribe capable of accurately and cleanly copying a book’s text onto a fresh codex or scroll roll. Copyists charge 1gp per page. The actual codex or scroll roll must be purchased separately.

**Creature Handler** (domestic animals, 25gp/month; wild animals, 75gp/month; dire, giant or prehistoric animals 150gp/month; monstrosities or vermin, 250/gp month): A creature handler is a specialist trained to safely handle hunting or guard creatures. Under normal circumstances, a fully-trained creature of animal intelligence doesn’t require a trained specialist to handle it. However, battlefields offer an overwhelming palate of sounds and smells that can test the discipline of even the best-trained creature. In such circumstances, one creature handler is required per 6 hunting creatures or 20 guard creatures. A creature handler is not required for mounts or war mounts; these creatures are kept under control by their riders. Sapient creatures never require creature handlers. Some creature handlers are animal trainers themselves, while others rely on Beast Friendship or similar powers. In either case, their wages are comparable to those for animal trainers.

**Engineer** (250gp/month): Engineers are architects and mathematicians who supervise large construction projects. The number of engineers required for a construction project is based on its total gp value. A minimum of 1 engineer is needed, with an additional engineer per 100,000gp value of the project. For example, if a project is 60,000gp it will require 1 engineer, and if it is 200,000gp it will require 2 engineers. Human engineers usually handle large aboveground structures, while dwarves are usually hired for underground construction.

**Healer** (healer 1gp/day/patient or 25 gp/month, physicker 2gp/day/patient or 50 gp/month, chirurgeon 4gp/day/patient or 100 gp/month): Healers are trained to treat wounds and diagnose illnesses. Being treated by a healer requires clean, sanitary conditions and bed rest. A patient under treatment of any healer regains an extra 1d3 hit points per day.

A normal healer can treat up to three patients per day, a physicker can treat up to four patients per day, and a chirurgeon can treat up to five patients per day. In addition, physickers can non-magically *neutralize poison*, *cure disease*, or *cure light injury* by spending one turn (10 minutes) and making a proficiency throw of 18+. Highly skilled chirurgeons can non-magically *neutralize poison*, *cure disease,* or *cure serious injury* with a proficiency throw of 14+. Either can use rare herbs to further improve some throws. See the Healing proficiency (p. XX) for more details.

**Laborer** (1sp/day or 2sp/day): Laborers can be hired in large numbers to work on construction projects. They can also be hired to carry loads or palanquins within civilized areas or on roads. Unskilled laborers have a cost and construction rate of 1sp per day. Skilled laborers have a cost and construction rate of 2sp per day. See **Construction Projects**, p. XX.

**Lawyer** (master practitioner, 100gp/month; licensed practitioner, 50gp/month; apprentice, 25gp/month): Lawyers can be hired to draft and execute contracts, testaments, and wills; to negotiate or handle business affairs; and most importantly to defend perpetrators of hijinks from criminal charges (p. XX). Two licensed practitioners and four apprentice practitioners will be available in the market for every master practitioner of the legal profession. (Other professionals are available in similar numbers.)

**Mariner** (rowers, 6gp/month; sailors 6gp/month; navigator 25gp/month; captain 100gp/month; master mariner 250gp/month): Rowers are skilled oarsmen who can row a boat or galley. Sailors are skilled seamen who can crew a sailing vessel. Navigators are skilled experts in charting course by the sun, moon, and stars. Captains and master mariners are masters of vessels.

A navigator is required any time a ship will venture beyond sight of a coast. A captain or master mariner is required for any large ship with more than 3 crew. Captains are skilled like a sailor and have more intimate knowledge of the particular coasts they frequent. Master mariners are superior at maneuvering at sea but are otherwise identical to captains.

All rowers and sailors, and most officers, are 0th level normal men, and are not armored; they will usually be armed with clubs, daggers, or short swords. About 25% of navigators, captains, and master mariners are leveled characters, often explorers or venturers of 1st, 3rd, or 4th level respectively. If so, they will be better equipped. Higher level mariners do not make themselves available for hire in the market but might be found on adventures.

**Marshal** (light infantry marshal, 30gp/month; bow, crossbow, or sling marshal 60gp/month; heavy infantry marshal, 60gp/month; light cavalry marshal 60gp/month; heavy cavalry marshal, 120gp/month; horse archer marshal, 120gp/month; cataphract marshal, 240gp/month): Marshals train soldiers in military discipline, physical fitness, and weapon drill. Training troops takes time, ranging from one month for light infantry to a full year for cataphract cavalry. The number of marshals required is based on the number of troops being trained. A minimum of 1 marshal is needed per 60 troops trained.

**Mercenary Officer** (lieutenant, 200gp/month; captain, 800gp/month; colonel, 3,000gp/month; general, 12,000gp/month): Mercenary officers can be hired to serve as the lieutenants of units or commanders or adjutants of divisions. Mercenary officers are usually (60%) fighters, but may sometimes be barbarians (10%), bards (10%), explorers (10%), or other classes (10%).

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

| **Mercenary Officer Characteristics** | | | |  | | | |
| **Officer Title** | **Level** | **Cost/Month** | **Leadership**  **Ability** | | **Strategic**  **Ability** | **Morale**  **Modifier** | **Proficiencies** |
| Lieutenant | 4th | 200gp | 4 | | +1 | +2 | Command, Military Strategy 1 |
| Captain | 6th | 800gp | 4 | | +2 | +3 | Command, Military Strategy 2 |
| Colonel | 8th | 3,000gp | 5 | | +2 | +3 | Command, Leadership, Military Strategy 2 |
| General | 10th | 12,000gp | 5 | | +3 | +3 | Command, Leadership, Military Strategy 3 |

The base level, cost, and characteristics of mercenary officers are noted on the Mercenary Officer Characteristics table. The officer characteristics can vary based on the officer’s attributes. Roll 3d6 to determine the officer’s INT, WIL, and CHA scores. For colonels and generals, re-roll any one attribute and use the new roll if desired. An officer’s other proficiencies are at the Judge’s discretion. For more information on leadership ability, strategic ability, and morale modifier, see **Armies** (p. XX).

Due to inherent disloyalty, all mercenary officers have a base loyalty of -2. Like all mercenaries, officers must make loyalty rolls each time they suffer a calamity. Mercenary officers also make loyalty rolls any time they are offered a higher wage by another employer. Mercenary officers who betray their leader will take with them any units assigned to their command! Wise leaders avoid mercenary officers where possible, preferring to entrust command of their units to adventuring comrades or trusted henchmen.

**Quartermaster** (40gp/month): A quartermaster is an experienced soldier who manages distribution of supplies and provisions to the troops of a unit. When troops are in the field and paying supply costs, at least one quartermaster must be available to the army’s leader per battalion of troops under his command. An army without a sufficient number of quartermasters will suffer from unfair distribution of supplies, cheating of provisions, and other indignities. The loyalty of the army is reduced by 1 until an appropriate staff of quartermasters is hired.

**Ruffian** (carouser, 7gp/month; footpad, 30gp/month; reciter, 30gp/month; slayer, 625gp/month; spy,625gp/month; thug 30gp/month): Ruffians are specialists in petty crime. Carousers are 0th level brawlers and hoodlums that populate inns and taverns. Footpads are 1st level thieves. Reciters are 1st level bards. Slayers are 4th level assassins. Spies are 4th level thieves. Thugs are 1st level assassins. Ruffians are hired on a monthly basis. They can be used as enforcers or muscle, or sent on various hijinks, such as assassinating, carousing, spying, stealing, or treasure-hunting. Ruffians will not go on adventures unless recruited as henchmen. Ruffians of 1st level or higher cost more than henchmen of their level because they must pay a tribute to their local crime boss. An adventurer who isthe local crime boss pays less (see p. XX). Ruffians are quite unreliable, and might stab the hiring character in the back (maybe literally) at any time.

**Siege Engineer** (50gp/month): Siege engineers are skilled in the construction and placement of temporary defensive works, artillery, and siege engines, with a construction rate of 6.6sp per day. They can also supervise others working on siege engineering projects of up to 25,000gp construction cost. They also can operate war machines of all types of artillery, battery rams, galleries, hoists, screws, and siege towers. See Siege Engineering proficiency (p. XX) and **War Machines** (p. XX).

**Sage** (500gp/month): Sages are scholars whose knowledge transcends the mundane and approaches the magical. Each sage specializes in a subject area, and can recall expert commentary or information relating to his specialty with a proficiency throw of 3+. Outside of his specialty, a sage can decipher occult runes, remember obscure facts, or identify a historic artifact part with a proficiency throw of 18+. Given one turn (10 minutes) of examination, he can recognize ordinary magical items or special components by examining them for one turn (10 minutes) with a proficiency throw of 11+. He can identify the exact properties of magic items with research as a 5th level mage.

**Scout** (pathfinder, 25gp/month; land surveyor, 25gp/month): Scouts are specialists in exploration, mapping, and land surveying. Pathfinders are 1st level explorers with the Pathfinder template and can be hired to search hexes for lairs. Land surveyors are 1st level explorers with the Cartographer template, and can be hired to assess the number of lairs in a hex. Both types of scout are hired on a monthly basis. Scouts will expect to be protected while on duty, either by their employer or by a number of mercenaries equal to the maximum number of lairs in the hex(es) they are assigned to explore. Scouts will attempt to evade any wandering monsters they encounter; they will not fight for their employer or enter lairs unless recruited as henchmen.

### Spellcasting Services

Arcane and divine casters are sometimes hired to cast a spell for an adventuring party. Most often these are divine casters asked to cast *cure disease*, *remove curse*, *restore life and limb*, and so on, but arcane casters can be sought out from time to time as well. The Spell Availability by Market table shows how many divine and arcane spellcasters capable of casting a given spell level can be found in any given market. Each spellcaster will be able to cast a spell of the given level once per day. The cost per casting is listed for each spell level as well. Just because a spellcaster can be found does not mean he will cast a spell for the adventurer — he must still be recruited through negotiation. Divine casters will never cast spells for adventurers of opposite alignment, and may charge double if the adventurers do not belong to their faith.

EXAMPLE: Quintus has been slain, while his companions (Balbus, Creven, and Marcus) have been infected with lycanthropy in a battle with wererats. The adventurers travel to the town of Siadanos (a Class IV market) to seek *restore life and limb* for Quintus and *cure disease* for the rest of the party. The Judge rolls on the Spell Availability by Market table to determine the availability of these spells.

*Cure disease* is a 3rd level divine spell, so the Judge rolls 2d4 to determine how many spell castings are available. Unfortunately he rolls a 2, so only two *cure disease* spells are available each day — not enough! *Restore life and limb* is a 5th level spell, so there are 1d4-3 available. The Judge rolls a 2, so there are none in Siadanos. The adventurers must decide whether to stay in town the two days necessary to get everyone cured of lycanthropy, or to press on immediately to try to find a caster who can raise Quintus.

###### Selling Spellcasting Services

While adventurers are usually consumers of spellcasting services rather than providers, from time to time, an industrious mage or other adventurer might decide to sell spellcasting services in the market. A spellcaster who dedicates a day to selling spells in a market should roll 1d6 for each spell he can cast in a day. On a roll of 6, he sells one casting of that spell and earns the fee for casting it. The maximum number of spells of a given level that can be sold in a day by a caster is 9 – (market class + spell level). Casters who reduce their price to attempt to sell more spells, or who regularly monopolize the spellcasting services, will inevitably find themselves targets for retribution by other spellcasters who do not like seeing their earnings reduced by price cuts and competition.

EXAMPLE: Elaria is a 7th level mage able to cast 3 1st, 2 2nd, 2 3rd, and 1 4th spell per day. In theory she could earn (3 x 5) + (2 x 10) + (2 x 45) + (1 x 185) = 310gp per day selling spells. However, she will tend to sell only 1 in 6 spells per day, for an average income of 51gp 66sp per day. Over 30 days, she will earn an average of 1,550gp – which is the typical salary for a 5th level character.

###### Perpetual Spellcasting as a Service

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Spell Level | Upfront Fee | Ongoing Monthly Fee |
| 1st level | 40gp | 1gp |
| 2nd level | 55gp | 2gp |
| 3rd level | 160gp | 5gp |
| 4th level | 440gp | 15gp |
| 5th level | 1,365gp | 40gp |
| 6th level | 4,515gp | 135gp |

Sometimes adventurers might pay a spellcaster to cast a spell with a perpetual duration, such as *perpetual illumination.* Because casters are strictly limited in how many perpetual spells they can sustain, they charge both an upfront fee and an ongoing maintenance fee. Use the adjoining table for such transactions.

EXAMPLE: A decadent noble wishes to illuminate his villa with 10 *perpetual illuminations* (3rd level). This costs him 1,600gp plus 50gp per month.

## Expected Living Expenses (Optional)

In the world of the Auran Empire, wealth is measured by what you spend, not what you save. To gain prestige, reputation, and respect, an up-and-coming adventurer should spend money appropriate to his position. The NPCs certainly will!

###### Abstract Living Expenses

An adventurer’s expected living expenses each month are equal to the wages of a henchmen of the same level. These funds are due at the end of each game month. Adventurers who do not spend at least this much each month are considered to be of lower level (equivalent to what they do spend) by NPCs in the world, including current and prospective henchmen.

###### Concrete Living Expenses

Sometimes it matters exactly what the money goes towards. The following in-game expenses can be applied against living expenses. No individual expense can count as more than half the total expenditure.

* Cost of renting a specific in-game location, or an implicit rent of 1/33 the gp value of a stronghold or home
* Cost of any number of artists, craftsmen, laborers, performers, or professionals, employed for personal and household use
* Cost of any animal trainers employed for ordinary animals
* Cost of any servants for personal and household use
* Cost of stabling or feed for 1 warhorse per class level, for personal and household use
* Cost of stabling or feed for up to 6 hunting dogs per class level, for personal and household use
* Cost of charitable or civic donations
* Cost of food, drink, or entertainment during a game session

The following in-game expenses cannot be counted as living expenses:

* Cost of weapons and armor
* Cost of adventuring gear
* Cost of magic items, identification, and spells cast
* Cost of mercenaries and ruffians
* Cost of henchmen
* Cost of liturgies applied towards domain morale
* Cost of excessive spending applied as reserve XP

EXAMPLE: A 9th level adventurer has living expenses of 7,250gp per month. He rents a 100,000gp villa for 3,000gp per month. He staffs his villa with 20 household servants (3gp each, 60gp total), a kennel master (animal trainer — domestic, 25gp), a stable master (animal trainer — domestic, 25gp), a personal physician (healer rank 3, 100gp), and personal tailor with journeymen and apprentices (150gp). He maintains a concubine in luxury (1,000gp) and is the patron of a master poet (75gp per month). He stables and feeds a warhorse (30gp) and six hunting dogs (6gp). He spends 1,000gp each month sponsoring gladiatorial games for the people. The remaining 1,779gp he spends on food, drink, baubles, and entertainment for himself and his companions.

## Construction Projects

While some equipment can be purchased at a market, the Equipment Availability tables sharply limit what is available for sale. Many large and expensive items must be constructed. This section provides rules for constructing structures, building ships, manufacturing siege engines, and more.

In ***ACKS II****,* all construction is handled as a series of **construction projects**. The default construction project is structure construction, but other examples include ship building, siege engine manufacture, field fortification, ammunition scavenging, and sapping. Structure construction, siege engine manufacture, and ship building are discussed in this section; ammunition scavenging, sapping, and other projects are presented in the context of Chapter 12, **Sieges**.

### Construction Cost, Rate, and Supervision

Regardless of type, every construction project has a **construction cost**. A project’s construction cost is equal to the base cost of the project in gold pieces. For example, a keep has a construction cost of 75,000gp while a heavy catapult has a construction cost of 800gp.

The construction cost is paid by the labor of **construction workers**. Each day, each worker contributes a gp value of construction towards the construction cost. This amount is known as the **construction rate**. A worker’s construction rate is normally identical to his wage rate.

Construction workers may be **unskilled laborers**, **skilled laborers**, **craftsmen**, and/or **engineers**. Unskilled laborers can be hired in the market or might be drawn from peasants, slaves, prisoners, conscripts, or even mercenaries on labor detail. Each unskilled laborer has a wage rate and construction rate of 3gp per month or 1sp per day. When levying peasants to serve as laborers, it has the same limits and effects on the domain as levying peasants into a militia (see p. XX).

|  |
| --- |
| **The Typical Laborer:** If you don’t want or need to differentiate between unskilled laborers, skilled laborers, craftsmen, and engineers, you can simply assume that everylaborer has a construction rate of 1 2/3 sp. Every 3,000 laborers will construct 500gp per day. This is a good option for large armies on long campaigns. |

Skilled laborers are trained workers in a physically demanding field such as bricklaying or stonecutting. Each skilled laborer (one with the appropriate Labor proficiency, as detailed in the **Proficiencies** chapter) has a wage rate and construction rate of 6gp per month or 2sp per day. One in four laborers is usually a skilled laborer. They can be hired in markets.

Craftsmen have considerably higher wage rates and construction rates. As detailed in the **Proficiencies** chapter*,* an apprentice craftsman can construct 10gp per month, a journeyman craftsman can construct 20gp per month, and a master craftsman can construct 40gp per month. Master craftsmen can also manage up to 2 journeymen and 4 apprentices to increase their construction rate by 50%. However, a master craftsman managing junior craftsmen on a large-scale construction project with others reduces his personal construction rate by 25% due to friction and chaos. There is usually no more than one master craftsman per one hundred laborers.

Engineers and siege engineers can labor on any type of construction project. A siege engineer has the construction rate of a journeyman craftsman, while an engineer has the construction rate of a master craftsman. (Note that this is less than their wage rate; such highly trained characters are better used as supervisors.) Characters with just one rank of Siege Engineering proficiency count as skilled laborers, not siege engineers.

The wage rates and construction rates of unskilled laborers, laborers, craftsmen, and engineers are summarized on the Wage and Construction Rates table, below. The sum of the construction rates of all the workers on the project is the **total construction rate**.

EXAMPLE: A construction project with 50 unskilled laborers has a total construction rate of 5gp per day. A construction project with 49 craftsmen (7 masters, 14 journeymen, and 28 apprentices) has a total construction rate of 35gp per day.

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Wage and Construction Rates** | | | |
| **Worker** | **Construction**  **Rate/Month** | **Construction**  **Rate/Day** | **Wage Rate/Month** |
| Unskilled Laborer | 3gp | 1sp | 3gp\* |
| Skilled Laborer | 6gp | 2sp | 6gp\* |
| Apprentice Craftsman | 10gp / 15gp\*\* | 33cp / 5sp\*\* | 10gp |
| Journeyman Craftsman | 20gp / 30gp\*\* | 66cp / 1gp\*\* | 20gp |
| Master Craftsman | 40gp / 30gp\*\* | 1gp, 33cp / 1gp\*\* | 75gp |
| Master, 2 Journeyman, and 4 Apprentices | 150gp\*\* | 5gp\*\* | 150gp |
| Siege Engineer | 20gp | 66cp | 50gp |
| Engineer | 40gp | 1gp, 33cp | 250gp |
| \*Troops on labor detail must still be paid their normal wage rate. Slaves or prisoners need not be paid any wages. | | | |
| \*\*When apprentices and journeymen are working under master on large project. | | | |

|  |
| --- |
| **Monstrous Workers:** Sometimes a construction project may have access to ogres, centaurs, giants, or other powerful creatures. Sapient monstrous workers multiply their construction rate (normally that of unskilled laborers) by their normal load / 5, rounded down. |

Any construction project of a structure or vessel must be overseen by a **construction supervisor**. Supervisors must either be siege engineers or engineers. A siege engineer may supervise one construction project of up to 25,000gp construction cost. An engineer may supervise one construction project of up to 100,000gp construction cost. Multiple engineers or siege engineers may work together to supervise large projects.

### Construction Sites

The geographic area around a construction project is called the **construction site.** As a general guideline, a construction site should be about half a mile in diameter. The exact border of the construction site is left to the Judge’s discretion. Any and all construction of a similar sort at the same construction site must be consolidated into a single construction project.

EXAMPLE #1: Marcus wants to build 2 keeps (75,000gp each), with 200’ of high wall (25,000gp each), on a large hill about a quarter mile in diameter. That means the 2 keeps are on the same site and must be combined into one construction project of 200,000gp.

EXAMPLE #2: Marcus wants to build a stone wall 20’ high and 100 miles long (528,000’). This great wall will cost 2,640,000gp. Because it occupies such a large geographic area, the Judge rules that the great wall must be divided into many different construction projects. Since a construction site is about half a mile in diameter, the Judge determines the great wall will encompass (100 / ½) 200 construction projects, each costing 13,200gp.

A maximum of 12,000 workers may work on any given construction site. The first 3,000 workers on a construction site work at their full construction rate. Any additional workers thereafter work at only 33% the normal construction rate, although the workers’ wage rates remain the same. Thus a project built with a workforce of more than 3,000 workers will end up costing more (in gp of wages paid) than the labor cost of the project. However, the project will get built faster.

EXAMPLE: Marcus initially hires 3,000 various laborers and craftsmen to construct his 200,000gp stronghold. The workers have a total wage rate of 500gp per day and total construction rate of 500gp per day. Wanting to hasten the project, Marcus decides to hire another 3,000 workers with identical characteristics. These additional workers will have a construction rate of just (33% x 500gp) 166gp per day. Their wage rate remains 500gp per day. Marcus’s workers now have a total wage rate of 1,000gp per day and a total construction rate of 666gp per day. Since Marcus’s stronghold has a base cost of 200,000gp, it will take (200,000 / 666) 300 days to build at a cost of (300 days x 1,000gp/day) 300,000gp in wages.

### Construction Materials

|  |
| --- |
| **Back to Basics:** The basic stronghold construction rules in the original ***ACKS Core***assumed a typical stronghold is constructed by around 3,000 men. Of these, 30 are master craftsmen of the various types, each with their 2 journeymen and 4 apprentices, 210 men total. These construct a total of 150gp per day. Another 525 skilled laborers and 2,450 unskilled laborers construct another 350gp per day. The total is thus 500gp of construction per day. The two systems (***ACKS Core***and ***ACKS II***) are compatible, so you can switch back and forth between them as appropriate. |

Construction projects require an available source of raw materials (lumber and/or stone). For ease of play, lumber is assumed to be cut down from a forest near the construction site, and stone is assumed to be drawn from quarries near the construction site. The time and effort required to secure these raw materials is already factored into the labor cost. The Judge should increase the labor cost of a construction project by 10%, 20%, or more when raw materials must be gathered and transported to the construction site from a long distance.

Alternatively, raw materials can be bought with cash at a market or scavenged from other buildings on the construction site. Raw materials of up to 50% of the total cost of the construction project can be purchased to reduce labor cost by an equal percentage. If scavenged from nearby buildings, the labor cost is reduced by one-half the value by which the buildings are reduced.

EXAMPLE: Marcus has access to the nearby market of Arganos. He decides to buy lumber and timber for his 200,000gp stronghold, in order to reduce the labor cost. He buys 50,000gp of raw materials (25% of the cost of the construction project) to reduce the labor cost is reduced by 25%, to 150,000gp. It will now take (150,000 / 666) 225 days to build the stronghold and cost (225 x 1,000gp) 225,000gp in wages.

### Construction Project Customization (Optional)

Players or judges might wish to build structures or vessels of their own design. To calculate the characteristics of your own customized floorplans, use the following process.

1. For surface structures, calculate the **cubic volume** of the structure’s frame (i.e. excluding interior volume). For excavated structures, calculate the volume of excavation. For ships, approximate the cubic volume of the ship’s frame using its displacement in pounds divided by 64 (or displacement in tons divided by 128,000).
2. Choose a material to be used or excavated. Find the cost per cubic foot on the table below. Multiply cost per cubic foot by the cubic volume. The product is the **material cost** of the structure.
3. Choose the type of construction for the material you’ve chosen and find the **complexity**. Increase the complexity by 6 if the structure is curved, rounded, or domed.
4. Multiply the material cost by the **complexity** to find the project’s total cost.
5. Calculate the structure’s weight in lbs by multiplying the structural frame volume by its material’s density.
6. Calculate a structure’s SHP using its structural strength.
7. Calculate the structure’s unit capacity by multiplying the square footage of its ground level by the number of stories, then dividing by 2400.

Stone construction uses adobe, concrete, fired brick, and, of course, stone. Improved buildings are similar to classical or high medieval buildings with mortared ashlar masonry or poured concrete. (Auran border forts use improved buildings.) Standard buildings are typical of dark age construction with dry rubble masonry.

Most wood construction uses cut, shaped, smoothed, fitted, and (where needed) water-proofed timber. However, crude wood construction uses deadwood, fallen trees, branches, and sticks. Crude wooden construction requires 1sp of daily maintenance per 1,000 cubic feet or it begins to fall apart. It takes 1 structural bludgeoning damage per day per 100 cubic feet in rainy or windy weather (p. XX). Crude wooden construction can be used to create crude traps (p. XX), hasty shelters, or temporary defensive works.

Crude rock excavations are rough-hewn and unpaved with ceilings supported by wooden frames. They are unsightly to look upon but functional. Superior rock excavations are smooth-hewn with stone supports or columns and a façade of masonry over the naked rock. Dwarven engineers typically use superior rock excavation for public places and living quarters, but crude rock for mines and tunnels.

Crude earth excavations are field expedient pits and trenches with faces of loose earth, absent structural support, prone to collapse and flooding. They require 1sp of daily maintenance per 1,000 cubic feet and take 1 structural bludgeoning damage per day per 100 cubic feet in rainy or windy weather. Superior earth excavations are engineered to last with wooden panels and supports over or in packed earth.

Except where otherwise noted, civilian stone buildings have walls 1’ feet thick. Stone stronghold buildings have 5’ thick walls. Stone keeps have 10’ thick walls. Wooden buildings have 1” thick walls and wooden vessels have 4” to 6” thick hulls.

### Assisting Construction with Magic

A spellcaster with Engineering proficiency, or under the supervision of an engineer, can use spells to assist construction. *Earth’s movement*,*earth’s**mire*, and *wall**of**stone*are the most valuable spells for construction projects.

A spellcaster can use *earth’s**movement*to dig or fill moats or erect earthen ramparts. The caster’s construction rate towards these projects is 2,500gp per turn. The spell expires after 6 turns, allowing 15,000gp of construction total. This construction rate can onlybe used on ditches, moats, and earthen ramparts!

EXAMPLE: Quintus wishes to build his sanctum, a huge tower, on a hill. Unfortunately, the grasslands of Southern Argollë where he is building are as flat as his spellbook. He casts *earth’s**movement*and gets to work fixing the local geography. An earthen rampart of 15,000 cubic feet costs 2,500gp. With a construction rate of 2,500gp per hour Quintus is able to erect an earthen mound of 50’ x 50’ x 6’ tall.

A spellcaster can use *earth’s**mire*to make the stone at a construction site easier to sculpt and mold until the mud hardens. For the duration of the spell (3d6 days), the workers can work stone as if it were earth, increasing their construction rate by 50%. (A stronghold constructed in this manner will look like it was built of mud or concrete rather than stone blocks.) This does not affect the worker’s wages.

EXAMPLE: The workers at Quintus’ construction site have a construction rate of 500gp per day. Since a huge tower has a cost of 54,000gp, it will take 108 days for them to build the tower. Quintus, an impatient fire mage, decides this is far too long. He casts *earth’s**mire*on the construction site. He rolls 3d6 for the duration and gets an 11. For the next 11 days, the worker’s construction rate will be (500gp x 150%) 750gp per day. “Better,” he thinks. “But not fast enough!”

A spellcaster capable of casting both *earth’s**movement*and*earth’s**mire*can speed up construction even further. *Earth’s**mire* is first used to transform the stone at a construction site into shapeable mud. *Earth’s**movement*is then used to pour the mud at the site into a wooden mold created by on-site workers. Subsequently, the *earth’s**mire*spell is **dispelled** or reversed, and the wooden molds are pulled down, leaving behind concrete-like stone. This combination of spells allows workers to construct stone structures as if they were wooden, doubling their construction rate.

EXAMPLE: Quintus halts work on the mud and orders the workers to instead construct a wooden mold for his sanctum. As the mold is erected, Quintus uses *earth’s**mire*and *earth’s**movement*to pour shapeable mud into the mold. When the mold is filled, he *dispels*the spell and returns the mud to rock. The workers then remove the wooden mold and a concrete-like tower remains. Using this process, the construction rate on the project becomes (500gp x 2) = 1,000gp per day. At this rate, it will take (54,000gp / 1,000gp) = 54 days to erect Quintus’ sanctum.

To further speed the process, a spellcaster can use *wall**of**stone*to create stone molds into which he can pour transformed mud. This removes the need for workers to construct wooden molds. Apply 500gp towards the stronghold’s construction cost per *wall**of**stone*spellcast in this manner.

EXAMPLE: Quintus, ever impatient, decides to supplement the wooden molds his workers are creating with stone molds made with magic. Each day, he casts three *walls**of**stone*in the form of stone molds. He then casts *earth’s**mire* on the construction site, and uses*earth’s**movement*to pour the transformed earth into the stone molds. He then **dispels** the *walls*and *mire*, leaving behind stone walls in the shape of the poured mold. In this manner, Quintus achieves a construction rate of (500gp per *wall**of**stone* x 3 castings) 1,500gp per day. This value, combined with the construction rate of the workers, yields a total construction rate of 2,500gp per day. It will take (54,000gp / 2,500gp) 21.6 days to complete the stronghold.

A spellcaster can also use *wall**of**stone* to re-surface a stone wall with a new surface, forming a magical “coat of paint”. Depending on the mage’s spell signature and desires, the *walls**of**stone* might be seamless and smooth, graven with strange runes, and/or made of exotic stones. Each *wall of stone* can re-surface 5,000gp of stronghold value.

EXAMPLE: Surveying his completed sanctum, Quintus decides that it lacks pizzazz. As a fire mage, Quintus is partial to red, so he uses a series of *wall**of**stone*spells to re-surface his sanctum’s outer walls with coral red marble. It takes (54,000gp / 5,000gp) 11 *walls**of**stone*to entirely re-surface the sanctum.

Finally, a spellcaster can also use *wall**of**stone* to instantly and permanently erect a stone structure of up to 250gp value. While permanent, a *wall**of**stone*can be **dispelled** easily. Because of this critical weakness, structures made up of *walls**of**stone*are easily destroyed. Any successful *counterspell* or *dispel**magic*cast will cause the *wall* to be instantly destroyed.

### Structure Construction

When drawing up floorplans for a structure, the dimensions given are the exterior dimensions of the stronghold. The interior space will be reduced by the thickness of the walls.

### Vehicle and War Machine Construction

When building a vehicle or war machine as a construction project, use the standard Construction Project rules except as follows:

* The normal limits regarding construction sites do not apply to vehicles and war machines. Any number of vehicles and war machines can be constructed simultaneously at the same site, provided enough supervisors are available.
* The number of workers able to work on any particular piece of artillery or siege equipment is limited. Huge siege towers are capped at 1,200 workers. Large siege towers are capped at 300 workers. All other artillery and siege equipment are capped at 50 workers. Because of these limits, craftsmen rather than unskilled laborers generally do the bulk of the work.

EXAMPLE: King Edward Longshanks orders the construction of a heavy trebuchet (2,500gp) under the supervision of a siege engineer. He assigns 5 master craftsmen with 10 journeymen and 20 apprentices, plus another 15 skilled laborers, for a total of 50 workers. The project has a construction rate of (5 x 5gp/day) + (15 x 0.2gp/day) = 28gp per day. After (2,500 / 28) 89 days, about three months, the workers finish construction of the trebuchet. King Edward dubs it “Warwolf” and immediately smashes Stirling Castle with it.

### Vessel Construction

When building a vessel as a construction project, use the standard Construction Project rules, except as follows:

* The construction site for the vessel must be adjacent to a navigable waterway.
* The normal limits regarding construction sites do not apply to vessels. Any number of vessels may be constructed simultaneously at the same site, provided enough supervisors are available. The number of supervisors is based on the total value of all vessels being constructed at the site.
* The number of workers able to work on any particular vessel is equal to the greater of 100 or the vessel’s maximum crew. Craftsmen rather than unskilled laborers generally do the bulk of the work.

EXAMPLE: Baal the Terrible orders the construction of a fleet of five 2-rower galleys (6,750gp each). 2-rower galleys have a maximum crew of 65. That’s less than 100, so instead 100 workers can work on each galley.

# Chapter 5: Spells

## Spells and Spell Casters

Spells can be cast only by characters of special classes, collectively called **spellcasters** or **casters**. When a caster casts a spell, he taps into a source of magical power and then channels that power into a specific supernatural effect. The specific effect is controlled by a combination of hand gestures and spoken incantations that specify the desired result. If the gestures and incantations are interrupted, the tapped power is wastefully diffused rather than properly channeled, so the effect does not occur.

The source of magical power that is tapped is determined by the type of magic. There are two **magic types** described in this book: **arcane** and **divine**. Other types of magic, such as **eldritch**, have been detailed in other ***ACKS***sourcebooks. Arcane casters tap the ambient power that suffuses the cosmos. Divine casters tap the power of immortal deities or ancestral spirits whom they venerate. Both types of casters draw on their own personal power to channel the external power they receive. Inexperienced casters quickly deplete their personal power and find themselves unable to continue to cast spells. Experienced casters develop greater reservoirs of personal power that enable them to cast spells more frequently.

Like characters, spells have **levels** that measure how powerful they are. For instance, some spells are 1st level spells, and some are 2nd level, and so on. Lower level characters can learn and cast only lower level spells, while higher level characters can access more powerful, higher level spells.

The divine spellcasters described in this rule book are crusaders, bladedancers, dwarven craftpriests, Nobiran wonderworkers, priestesses, shamans, and witches. The arcane spellcasters are mages, elven nightblades, elven spellswords, Nobiran wonderworkers, warlocks, and Zaharan ruinguards. Some rules will apply only to one type of caster, or even just to one class, while others apply to all classes and all types. If a rule does not specify a particular type of spellcaster, it applies to all classes and all types of spellcasters.

###### Castings per Day

During any single day, spellcasters can cast the number of spells of each level indicated on the Spells Progression table for their class. Unlike other fantasy games, in the ***Adventurer Conqueror King System****,* spellcasters do not have to “memorize” or “prepare” their spells in advance; they can choose which spells to cast at the time of casting from among any and all the spells in their **repertoire** (see below).

Once a caster has cast all of his available spells, he has exhausted his personal power and cannot continue to cast spells. The number of castings available to the caster refreshes each time the caster enjoys 8 hours of restful sleep. A caster cannot enjoy more than 8 hours of restful sleep in any 24-hour period.

###### Casting Requirements

All spellcasters need to be able to move their hands and speak in order to make the gestures and say the incantations that bring magic effects into being. As a result, a spellcaster cannot cast spells if he is gagged, his hands are tied, or he is in an area under the effects of a **noiselessness** spell.

Casting a spell takes one round of game time. A caster cannot take any other actions during the round he casts a spell. As described in the **Initiative** section of Chapter 6,a caster must announce the intention to cast a spell prior to initiative being determined at the beginning of a round. If the caster takes damage or fails a saving throw that round before the spell is cast, the spell is disrupted and fails. The spell still counts against the caster’s spells per day as if it had been cast, and the caster loses his action for the round.

Some spells require other conditions be met before they can be cast. For instance, some spells might require the caster to touch the target, others might require that the caster be outdoors or near a fire. Each spell’s description will list these conditions, if any apply.

## Spell Lists by Magic Type

Each type of magic has its own **spell list** which includes every spell its practitioners could theoretically cast.The length of a magic type’s spell list is theoretically infinite so for practical purposes this book presents only the most common spells for each type.

The Arcane Spell List presented in this book consists of just the arcane spells which the Tower of Knowledge in Aura has canonical knowledge, either because it teaches them or has banned them. Many spells that were once known have been forgotten, existing only in dusty tomes and rare grimoires, or in the minds of slumbering undead lords. Studious casters can, when they reach 5th level, begin to research their own additions to their magic’s spell list.

The Divine Spell List presented in this book consists of all of the divine spells which are known to the theologians of Aura. The list includes those granted by the Empyrean gods of Law, the Chthonic gods of Chaos, and the numerous elemental powers, petty gods, and lesser spirits of the world. There are other divine spells in the game world, made available by old powers long forgotten or bizarre cults with strange practices.

## Spell Repertoires

Just because a spell is listed on a magic type’s spell list does not mean that any given spellcaster of that type can cast it. Each caster has his own **spell repertoire** which consists of the spells he can actually cast.A spell repertoire is always a small sub-set of a spell list.

There are two different types of repertoires described in this book: **studious** and **prayerful.** Most of the divine casters in this book, with the exception of the dwarven craftpriest and the witch, use prayerful repertoires. All of the arcane casters in this book, as well as the dwarven craftpriest and witch, use studious repertoires. Prayerful and studious spellcasters have very different spell repertoires and learn their repertoire in very different ways. As the name suggests, prayerful casters receive and maintain their repertoire through prayer; studious spellcasters receive and maintain their repertoires through study.

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | Arcane | Divine |
| Prayerful | None | Used by bladedancers, crusaders, priestesses, and shamans, who cast spells that tap the power of immortal deities through prayer. |
| Studious | Used by elven nightblades, elven spellswords, mages, Nobiran wonderworkers, warlocks, and Zaharan ruinguards, who cast spells that tap the ambient power in cosmos through formulaic procedures. | Used by dwarven craftpriests, who cast spells by tapping the power of ancestral spirits and ancient relics through formulaic procedures; and witches, who cast spells by cajoling, coercing, and petitioning old powers with formulaic procedures. |

### Prayerful Repertoire

Prayerful casters receive their repertoires from prayer to the deity, demon, elemental lord, god, or other power they serve. In order to maintain these repertoires they must pray each day.

###### Repertoire Rules

Each prayerful caster has a repertoires consisting of 10 – 15 spells of each level they can cast, representing those miracles the deity has empowered him to perform. The prayerful repertoires in this book are divided by class, with each class serving a particular god that offers a particular repertoire:

* The Crusader Repertoire represents the selection of spells available to crusaders of Ammonar, the god of light and law. It would also be appropriate for worshippers of other solar deities and sky gods. Ammonar provides his crusaders with spells to heal and protect the faithful; command by holy word; find and destroy undead; and even summon an angelic herald or bring down a fiery pillar on foes.
* The Bladedancer Repertoire represents the selection of spells available to bladedancers of Ianna, the goddess of love and war. It would also be appropriate for worshippers of other gods and goddesses of beauty, competition, excellence, love, strife, and war. Ianna offers many of the same spells as Ammonar, but with quite a few alternatives that are specific to her grace and style, such as the ability to create alluring illusions or to take flight as a winged warrior.
* The Priestess Repertoire represents the selection of spells available to priestesses of Mityara, goddess of marriage and mercy. It would also be appropriate for worshippers of deities devoted to medicine, peace, wisdom and similar civilizational values. Compared to Ammonar and Ianna, Mityara offers far fewer spells devoted to battle and combat, and far more spells devoted to healing and protection. Because priestesses fully devote themselves to faith and prayer, without training in hand-to-hand combat, they have larger repertoires than bladedancers and crusaders. (Crusaders or bladedancers of Mityara, if such a thing existed, would have only 10 spells of each level in their repertoire.)
* The Shaman Spell List represents the selection of spells available to ancestor worshippers, animists, druids, and other shamans. It would also be appropriate to worshippers of Naurivus, god of wind and weather, or similar nature deities. These casters have many spells relating to animals, plants, wind, and weather.

These four repertoires are just a small set of examples and many other repertoires are possible. The Judge is responsible for determining which specific spells are provided to any given prayerful caster in his campaign setting. He can use the pre-generated lists we’ve created, or create his own lists by selecting appropriate spells from the Divine Spell List (p. XX).

###### Prayer Requirement

To stay in the favor of his deity, a prayerful spellcaster must pray at an appointed time (usually sunrise or sunset) for at least one hour per day. This prayer counts as an ancillary activity (p. XX). A prayerful spellcaster who fails to pray at the appointed time more than once in any seven days becomes **disfavored** by his deity. A prayerful caster can also become disfavored if he fails to uphold his class’s code of behavior (Judge’s discretion). Each time a disfavored castercasts a spell, he must roll 1d6. On a 1 - 2, the spell fails. The failed spell still counts against the number of spells he can cast per day. Disfavor from failure to pray ends as soon as the caster meets his daily prayer requirement. Undead in *torpor* (p. XX) never become disfavored for failing to pray, as their dark god knows why they slumber.

### Studious Spell Repertoire

Studious casters receive their repertoire of spells from the study of **spell formulas**.In order to maintain these repertoires they must study the formulas each day. A spell formula consists of various texts, diagrams, illustrations, and charts written on one or more pieces of paper (or equivalent material). A spell’s formula always takes up one page (or equivalent) per spell level. A caster must be able to read the language used in the formula in order to study it, making the ability to speak many languages very valuable for every studious caster.

###### Repertoire Rules

Each studious spellcaster has his own unique repertoire of spells determined by the spell formulas he frequently studies. It might be just one spell or dozens. The maximum number and level of spells in a studious caster’s repertoire is equal to the number and level of spells he can cast per day. This maximum is increased by the caster’s Intellect bonus at each spell level he can cast. For instance, a 3rd level mage is able to cast two 1st and one 2nd level spell per day. Therefore the maximum number and level of spells in his repertoire is two 1st and one 2nd level spells. If that 3rd level mage has 16 INT (+2 modifier), then his maximum spell repertoire is increased to four 1st level and three 2nd level spells. Thus studious casters of limited experience and middling intelligence are restricted to small repertoires while powerful and intelligent casters can have large repertoires.

Because a studious caster must have access to spell formulas in order to build his repertoire, it is possible (indeed, common) for a studious caster to have fewer spells in his repertoire than the maximum amount his class level and Intellect would otherwise permit. Conversely, it is also possible for a fortunate studious caster to end up in possession of far more spell formulas than he has room for in his repertoire.

To organize their collection of spell formulas, studious casters gather them together in **spell books**.A spell book can be, but does not have to be, an actual codex. Some spell books are true works of art, cased in precious metal or rare wood, with vellum pages illumined and illustrated with colorful inks. Others resemble a pile of scrolls shoved in a box in alphabetic order. A typical spell book is a sturdy leatherbound parchment codex with 100 pages. A blank 100-page spell book costs 20gp.

###### Study Requirement

To keep himself attuned to the power of magic, a studious caster must track the alignment of the celestial spheres, the astrological movements of the stars, the waxing and waning of the planets, and other factors of metaphysical importance. Each day, after he rests, a studious caster must spend at least one hour reviewing these factors. This study counts as an ancillary activity (p. XX). A studious caster who misses more than one day of study in any seven days becomes **forgetful** when casting spells. Each time a forgetful castercasts a spell, he must roll 1d6. On a 1 - 2, the spell fails. The failed spell still counts against the number of spells he can cast per day. Forgetfulness ends as soon as the caster meets his daily study requirement. Undead in *torpor* (p. XX) never become forgetful, as no time passes for them.

In order to meet his daily study requirement, a studious caster must have the spell formula for each of the spells in his repertoire at hand. If the caster does not have physical access to one or more of the spell formulas, he becomes **forgetful** when casting those spells. To avoid becoming forgetful, a studious caster who adventures away from home should be sure to bring a spell book containing the necessary formulas with him!

Poor or inexperienced studious casters often have just one small spell book, which they guard jealously. More established studious casters tend to own many spell books, with one or more “traveling” spell books containing the formulas for the spells in their repertoire, and the rest containing the formulas for spells not in their repertoire. These latter spell books can be consulted should the caster wish to change his repertoire (see below). Extra spell books are usually kept in a library, laboratory, or secure vault.

EXAMPLE: Quintus is a 3rd level mage with INT 16. His repertoire of spells consists of four 1st level spells (*discern magic*, *illumination, mage missile*,and *slumber*) and three 2nd level spells (*battering ram*, *circling winds*,and *sudden staircase*). He owns a 100-page spell book, which contains those seven spell formulas. They use up 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 10 pages in his book. Each day, Quintus studies the spell formulas in his book for one hour to avoid becoming forgetful.

One day, an unpleasant vandal tears the page containing the *illumination* formula out of Quintus’s spell book. Quintus can no longer meet his daily study requirement for *illumination,* so he becomes **forgetful** when casting that spell. Each time he casts *illumination,* he faces a 2-in-6 chance of the spell failing. In order to end this disattunement, Quintus must recover (or get a new copy of) the *illumination* formula and study it.

Rather than go shopping for a new spell formula, Quintus decides to pursue the vandal to recover his stolen formula. Unfortunately, he gets captured instead. Quintus is left to rot in a prison cell for days, during which time he is unable to meet his daily study requirement at all. When his comrades rescue him, Quintus is **forgetful** of his entire repertoire. Each time he casts anyspell, he faces a 2-in-6 chance of the spell failing. The condition lasts until Quintus is able to meet his daily study requirement.

###### Starting Spell Repertoire

A 1st level studious spellcaster starts the game with a base of one 1st level spell in his repertoire, plus one additional 1st level spell per point of Intellect bonus. But which spells?

If the campaign is using the template rules (p. XX), then the caster’s template will provide two spells for the caster’s repertoire. If the caster has an INT of 9 – 12 he only gets the first of the two spells. If he has an Intellect of 16 – 17 he will get one additional spell for his repertoire, and if he has an INT of 18 he will get two additional spells. The Judge can select the additional spells or allow the player to roll for them. Studious arcane casters, such as mages, should roll on the Arcane Spell List using (1d3-1) x 12 + 1d12 to generate a range of values from 01 to 36. Studious divine casters, such as dwarven craftpriests, should roll on the Divine Spell List using (1d3-1) x 10 + 1d10 to generate a range of values from 1 to 30. If the player rolls any duplicates do not re-roll; his character will begin play with less than the maximum permitted spells in his repertoire. He will need to find spell formulas in play.

If the campaign is not using the template rules, then the Judge should select an appropriate spell for each studious spellcaster to begin with from their spell list. The spells *beguile humanoid*, *fan of flames*,*mage missile*,or*slumber* are good choices for studious arcane casters. The spells *cure light injury*, *holy circle*,*sling stone*, and *word of command*are good choices for studious divine casters. The Judge can then choose the remaining spells or have the player roll for them, as above.

Whichever method is used, the caster starts with the spell formula for each of the spells in his repertoire recorded on the pages of his starting spell book.

EXAMPLE: Sürcaneus is a 1st level mage with INT 16 (+2). His spell repertoire can be up to three 1st level arcane spells. Sürcaneus’s Judge has opted not to use templates for this campaign. For Sürcaneus’s first spell, the Judge selects *slumber.*Sürcaneus then rolls 1d3-1 and 1d12 on the arcane spell list. With a roll of 1 x 12 on and 7, he adds spell #19, *infuriate humanoid*, from the Arcane List to his repertoire. Sürcaneus then rolls 1d3-1 and 1d12 again and scores a 2 x 12 and 6, for a 30. Unfortunately spell #30 is *slumber,* which he already knows. Sürcaneus doesn’t get to roll again. Instead, Sürcaneus will begin play with just *slumber* and *infuriate humanoid* in his repertoire and just those two formulas in his spell book. He can add the extra 1st level spell to his repertoire once play begins by finding a 1st level spell formula somewhere.

EXAMPLE: Alpin is a 1st level dwarven craftpriest with INT 11 (+0). His spell repertoire consists of just one 1st level divine spell. Alpin’s Judge is using templates for this campaign. Alpin rolls 3d6 on the Dwarven Craftpriest Templates table and scores an 11, Redeemer. The Redeemer template begins with *counterspell* and *discern magic*. Because Alpin only has an INT of 11, he can’t have two spells in his repertoire, and he only gets the first spell. Alpin will begin play with just *counterspell* in his repertoire and just its formula in his spell book.

###### Acquiring New Spell Formulas

Each time he advances in level, a studious spellcaster increases his maximum repertoire by one or more spells. To take advantage of this increased maximum, the caster will need to acquire the spell formulas for the spells he wants to add to his repertoire. There are a number of ways in which a studious caster can acquire spell formulas.

* He can copy a spell formula from a magic scroll, fellow mage’s spell book, or other source straight into his own spell book. He can copy an existing formula at a rate of one page per day of dedicated activity, plus one page per rank in Art (calligraphy) or Craft (scribing). He must have a book with blank pages available to copy into.
* He can buy or steal a spell formula or even an entire spell book from another mage. In this case, he does not need to re-write a formula in his own hand unless he wants to; some casters are comfortable having their spell formula spread out across many volumes by different authors. Others are more fastidious and prefer to copy each spell formula they find in their own hand, perhaps translating it into a preferred language as they do.
* He can engage in spell research in order to discover the formula for an existing or new spell. Spell research is a lengthy and expensive proposition that only can be pursued by experienced casters. See Chapter 8 (p. XX) for details.

Whatever method the caster uses to get the spell formula, the next step will be to put it in his repertoire, either by adding it to an incomplete repertoire or replacing an existing spell in a full repertoire.

###### Adding or Replacing Spells

If a studious caster has fewer spells in his repertoire than his permitted maximum, he can add a spell to his repertoire by studying its spell formula as a dedicated activity for one week. When he has finished his week of intense study, he can add the spell to his repertoire.

If a studious caster already has the maximum number of spells in his repertoire, he can replace a spell in his repertoire with a new spell of the same level. He still must dedicate a week to studying the new spell formula, but when he has finished his week of intense study, he replaces one spell of the same level with the new spell he has learned. The caster chooses which spell to replace. Replacing a spell in the repertoire does not cause the character to lose the formula of the replaced spell.

###### Recovering from a Lost or Destroyed Spell Book

Sometimes, through bad fortune or enemy action, the spell book containing the formula for a studious caster’s repertoire might get lost or destroyed. If necessary, a studious caster can re-write the spell formulas from memory. He can rewrite one page per day of dedicated activity, plus one page per rank in Art (calligraphy) or Craft (Scribing).

EXAMPLE: When Quintus finally confronts the vandal who captured him, he discovers the nasty fellow burned his spell book to ash. After killing the vandal, Quintus sets out to re-create his spell book. The spell formulas for each of the four 1st level spells in his repertoire are one page each. The spell formulas for each of the three 2nd level spells in his repertoire are two pages each. Therefore it takes him (4 x 1) + (3 x 2) = 10 days to re-write his spell book. Since his spell book originally had 10 pages, this makes sense!

## Spell Reversal

Some spells, marked with an asterisk (\*) on the spell lists, can be cast **reversed.** A reversed spell results in an effect that is opposite to the effect the spell normally causes. For example, when a mage casts *petrification*, he can turn a flesh-and-blood creature into stone. But when a mage casts the reverse spell, *depetrification*, he can restore a creature that has been petrified back to life. Where it is not self-evident, the spell descriptions below will explain what reversed spells do. If a spell name is not marked with an asterisk, the spell is not reversible.

Studious spellcasters must treat the normal and reversed version of a spell as separate spells for purposes of their repertoire. Prayerful spellcasters know both the normal and reversed form of any spell on their spell list. However, Lawful divine spellcasters prefer to cast spells in their normal form, e.g. favoring *remove fear*over *cause fear*and *cure light injury*over *cause light injury*, and will use the reversed forms only against Chaotic opponents**.** Conversely, Chaotic divine spellcasters will freely cast reversed spells such as *cause fear*, while using the normal version only to aid comrades and followers. Some divine spellcasters might be restricted entirely by their deity from using normal or reversed versions of particular spells (Judge’s discretion).

## Spell Signatures

While spells have general effects that are common to all who cast them, the specific sensory effects associated with the spell inevitably vary from caster to caster. This specific sensory effect is known as the **spell signature**.The player of a spellcaster can write a short description of the signature for his caster or detailed descriptions of the signature of each spell, as he desires. For arcane spellcasters, the signature might be based on a particular school or style of magic, or simply be a reflection of the spellcaster’s personal taste. For divine spellcasters, the signature should reflect the caster’s relationship with his deity. A character’s choice of proficiencies can be suggestive of appropriate spell signatures.

EXAMPLE: Sargon pursues necromantic magic and has the Black Lore of Zahar proficiency. His player decides that all of Sargon’s spell signatures will revolve around death. His *mage missiles*appear as shards of bone. His *slumber* spell places its targets into a nightmarish slumber where they dream of Hell. His *thunderbolt* is crackling blue-black energy. His *wall of stone* has the appearance of tombstones graven with the names of the dead.

A character with the Sensing Power proficiency can sense the spell signature of arcane casters up to 24 hours after a spell has been cast. A caster who casts *scry* can inadvertently reveal his spell signature to those he scries upon. A caster who casts *reveal ritual magic* can discern the spell signature of whoever is casting the ritual. A character can make a Collegiate Wizardry proficiency throw to identify famous casters or particular schools of magic by their spell signature. A character can make a Theology proficiency throw to identify famous religious orders by their spell signature.

## Spell Types

Every spell is classified according to its **spell type**, which gives a broad description of what the spell is supposed to do. There are 13 different types of spells: **blast**, **death**, **detection**, **elemental**, **enchantment**, **esoteric**, **healing**, **illusion**, **movement**, **protection**, **summoning**, **transmogrification**, and **wall** spells. Some spells have just one type, while others have several.

### List of Spell Types

###### Blast Spells

Blast spells can deal damage or detrimental effects to individual targets or over areas of effect through evoking a medium such as arcane force, fire, or toxic gas*. Battering ram, mage missile,* and *thunderbolt* are examples of blast spells. (In contrast, a spell that deals damage directly through magic, such as *dismember*, is a death spell.) Blast spells usually require the caster to make an attack throw or the target to make a Blast saving throw. Blast spells that require an attack throw benefit from the Battle Magic proficiency. Some blast spells are elemental and will benefit from Elementalism proficiency.

###### Death Spells

Death spells can deal damage or detrimental effects to targets directly. Death spells also deal in necromantic energy, capable of draining and transferring life energy or animating the dead. *Animate dead*, *dismember*, and *necromantic potence*are examples of death spells. Death spells usually require their targets to make Death saving throws avoid their effects. Death spells benefit from the Black Lore of Zahar proficiency.

###### Detection Spells

Detection spells can discern or locate particular categories of creatures, powers, or objects within range. *Discern magic*,*locate haunting*, and*reveal ritual magic*are examples of detection spells. While very useful, detection spells can never be used to detect abstract or ambiguous concepts such as “danger” or “traps.” Detection spells do not benefit from any particular class powers or proficiencies in this book, although the Judge may create these if desired.

###### Elemental Spells

Elemental spells can conjure, destroy, or manipulate one of the fundamental elements of air, earth, fire, and water. Each elemental spell denotes its sub-type in parentheses, e.g. elemental (fire). *Earth’s excrescence*, *fan of flames,* *thunderbolt,* and *wall of frost* are examples of elemental earth, fire, air, and water spells respectively. Elemental spells benefit from the Elementalism proficiency. All elemental spells always belong to another type as well. For instance *fan of flames* is a blast and elemental fire spell, while *wall of frost* is a wall and elemental water spell.

###### Enchantment Spells

Enchantment spells can bewitch, dominate, halt, frighten, mesmerize, or otherwise affect the mind and will of target creatures. *Bewitch humanoid*, *halt monster,* and *slumber* are examples of enchantment spells. Enchantment spells are more difficult to detect than other types of spells. Enchantment spells benefit from the Mastery of Enchantments & Illusions proficiency.

###### Esoteric spells

Esoteric spells can produce supernatural effects that no other type of spell can. Esoteric spells were discovered or developed in ages long past, and many of the esoteric spells written about in ancient accounts have been lost to the Tower of Knowledge. Those that remain known are some of the most important spells in existence. It is almost impossible for casters in this fallen age to create new esoteric spells or to enchant them into magic items, so many casters seek out ancient ruins and lost civilizations in the hopes of discovering them. *Communion, perpetual illumination,* and *rune of warding* are examples of esoteric spells.

###### Healing Spells

Healing spells can regenerate, revitalize, or even resurrect creatures. Healing spells can be reversed to damage or kill, in which case they function like weak death spells (above). *Cure light injury,**neutralize poison*,and *restore life and limb*are examples of healing spells. Reversed healing spells can benefit from the Black Lore of Zahar proficiency, just as death spells do.

###### Illusory Spells

Illusion spells can create or suppress sensory data in the minds of those they affect. Illusion spells work by invoking a special pattern of light and/or sound that, when witnessed, triggers a particular hallucination in the mind of those who witnessed it. The pattern of the illusion has an objective existence but the hallucination it induces exists only in the mind. Because they exist in the mind, illusion spells are vulnerable to disbelief. A creature who successfully disbelieves an illusion sees or hears the pattern of the illusion but does not experience the hallucination it induces. *Chimerical figment, illusory interior,* and *mirage* are examples of illusion spells.Illusion spells benefit from the Mastery of Enchantments & Illusions proficiency.

###### Movement Spells

Movement spells allow creatures to move, or be moved, directly through the application of magical power. *Flight,* *teleportation*, and *telekinesis* are all movement spells. In contrast, a spell that allows a character to fly by taking on the characteristics of a bird would be a transmogrification spell. Movement spells do not benefit from any particular class powers or proficiencies in this book, although the Judge may create these if desired.

###### Protection Spells

Protection spells enhance armor and saving throws, ward off foes, and provide protection from various spells, weapons, and elements, directly through magic. *Blast ward, holy circle,* and *shimmer* are examples of protection spells. In contrast, a spell that increased a character’s armor class by taking on the characteristics of a turtle would be a transmogrification spell. Protection spells benefit from the Bright Lore of Aura proficiency.

###### Summoning Spells

Summoning spells bring creatures from “elsewhere” to serve the spellcaster. There are three sub-types of summoning spells. Callings summon non-sapient creatures to arrive by means of their own locomotion to serve for a day. *Call of the wolf* is an example of a calling. Conjurations summon powerful creatures to serve the caster for a brief period of time. Conjured creatures are usually very powerful but actively hostile and must be controlled through concentration. *Conjure genie* is an example of a conjuration. Summonssummon one or more creatures for extended periods of time. *Summon hellhounds* is an example of a summons. Callings are widely used by divine casters, while conjurations and summons are favored by arcane casters of a Chaotic bent. Whatever their sub-type, most summoning spells take a long time to cast and some are quite restricted in the frequency and method of use. Summoning spells benefit from the Mastery of Conjuration & Summoning proficiency.

###### Transmogrification

Transmogrification spells transform the physical and/or mental characteristics of creatures or objects. Most transmogrification spells can only affect man-sized targets; the larger the target, the more powerful the magic required. Some transmogrification spells affect the creature’s entire being, whereas others only modify a characteristic while leaving the creature mostly unaltered. *Adjust self, transform other*, and *winged flight*are examples of transmogrification spells. Transmogrification spells benefit from the Transmogrification proficiency, naturally. Some transmogrification spells have an elemental component (usually stone) and will benefit from Elementalism proficiency.

###### Wall Spells

Wall spells create barriers of physical, elemental, or magical substance. While drawing on similar energies as blast spells, wall spells benefit from having malleable or mobile areas of effect with very long durations. *Barrier of blades*, *cloud of poison*,and *wall of thunder*are examples of wall spells. Many wall spells also are elemental and will benefit from Elementalism proficiency. Unusual wall (one might say “off the wall”) spells can sometimes benefit from other proficiencies. For example, *wall of corpses*creates a wall made of undead, and so benefits from Black Lore of Zahar.

### Spell Type Abbreviations

In the spell lists below, the following superscripts are used to designate particular types of spells. This can be helpful to the player or Judge in quickly determining which spells are affected by various proficiencies and class powers. The spell type is also listed for each spell in its spell description.

bst blast

dth death

det detection

elm (type) elemental (type)

enc enchantment

eso esoteric

heal healing

ill illusion

mov movement

nec necromancy\*

pro protection

sum summoning

trn transmogrification

wal wall

\*All necromancy spells are formally part of the death type, but we have differentiated them to assist players in quickly identifying those spells which harm living creatures from those spells which control or create undead.

## Spell Descriptions

### Spell Format

All spells are presented in this format:

Spell Name

[Magic Type] [Level] Type: [Spell Type]

Range: [Spell Range] Duration: [Spell Duration]

[Spell Description]

A spell’s **magic type** is either Arcane or Divine. A spell’s **level** ranges from 1 to 6. A spell’s **duration** is the length of time the effects of the spell last. A spell’s **range** is an indication of how far from the caster the spell can reach.

### Defined Terms

###### Affected Creature

An affected creature is either a recipient or target of a spell, or a creature inside the area of effect of a spell. The caster himself can be an affected creature for many spells.

###### Ally

An ally is a creature friendly to the spell’s caster, recipient, or target. The Judge makes the final determination as to which creatures, if any, count as allies. A caster is generally his own ally.

###### Animal

An animal is any animal, giant animal, or prehistorical animal that is not a giant, humanoid, monstrosity, or undead.

###### Baseline Hit Dice

A creature’s Baseline Hit Dice are the number of HD listed for a creature of its kind in the ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual****.* A creature can have more than its Baseline Hit Diceif it is a leveled adventurer, chief, champion, or other character with more HD than the baseline, but those HD are not considered Baseline HD. For instance, an ogre has 4+1 Baseline HD, while a 14th level fighter has only 1 Baseline HD. Baseline HD are only used for a small number of purposes, including determining whether a creature is considered a humanoid as well as the number of HD the creature has if animated as a skeleton or zombie.

###### Beholding

Some spells require that the caster is beholdingthe target or (more commonly) that the target is beholdingthe caster or the effect. Beholding simulates eye contact, “seeing the white of their eyes,” and so on. A creature beholds another creature or effect when that creature or effect is in its line of sight and within 10% of maximum visibility distance. (In normal conditions, the maximum visibility distance to a man-sized creature is 600’, so it can be beheld at 60’.) Magic effects count as man-sized creatures for purposes of being beheld. A creature can behold creatures or effects using lightless vision, but not using echolocation, mechanoreception, or shadowy senses. At the start of its initiative, a creature can close its eyes to avoid beholding a creature or effect or open its eyes if currently doing so. A creature that is closing its eyes is considered **blinded** until it stops closing its eyes.

###### Caster

The caster is the creature that cast the spell being described.

###### Caster level

Caster level is the effective level of the caster for purposes of spellcasting. Caster level is usually, but not always, the same as class level. However, some classes have a caster level that is lower than their class level, and some proficiencies can increase caster level for purposes of particular types of spells.

###### Concentration

Concentration is a condition required by some spells. Concentration can be sustained for up to 8 hours per day without penalty; concentrating for up to 12 hours counts as force marching. The condition is ended immediately if the creature takes damage or fails a saving throw (except a secret saving throw it isn’t aware of). The condition is also ended immediately if the creature attacks, casts a spell, moves more than one-half its combat movement distance during a round, or moves more than one-half its expedition speed during a day. Taking an action in lieu of moving, however, does not end the condition, nor does moving at exploration speed.

###### Dead

A recipient or target of a spell is considered dead if it was a living creature and has been slain. Conjured or summoned creatures are dispelled or destroyed rather than slain, and do not ever count as dead, but called creatures can be slain.

A living creature that is unconscious and possibly dead can be targeted with a spell as if it were dead. The spell triggers an immediate roll on the Mortal Wounds table with a penalty equal to one-half the spell level. If the creature is slain, the spell takes effect normally. If the creature is still alive, the spell fails. The effects of the roll are applied to the creature in either case.

###### Dispelled

A spell is dispelled if it is successfully extinguished by a *counterspell* or *dispel magic* spell. A curse is dispelled if it is successfully extinguished by a *remove curse*spell. A conjured or summoned creature is dispelled if it is returned to its plane of existence by a *dispel evil* or *dispel magic* spell or by the caster. Some spells cannot be dispelled, or have more stringent requirements to dispel.

###### Enchanted Creature

An enchanted creature is any construct, incarnation, or undead, or any conjured or summoned creature regardless of type, or any other type of creature designated in the ***Monstrous Manual***as enchanted. Called creatures are not enchanted creatures, however.

###### Enemy

An enemy is a creature hostile to the spell’s caster, recipient, or target. Enemy is synonymous with opponent and hostile creature. The Judge makes the final determination as to which creatures, if any, count as enemies.

###### Humanoid

A humanoid is any bugbear, dryad, dwarf, elf, gnoll, gnome, goblin, hobgoblin, human, kobold, lizardman, merman, morlock, neanderthal, naiad, ogre, pixie, sprite, troglodytes, or other man-like creatures no larger than an ogre and possessing fewer than 5 Baseline Hit Dice.

###### Living

A recipient or target of a spell is considered living if it is an animal, giant, humanoid, monstrosity, ooze, plant, or vermin that is not dead or undead.

###### Indefinite

Indefinite is a spell duration. An indefinite spell lasts until a particular circumstance causes it to end. The circumstances that end the spell will be described in the spell description; they might be a saving throw by the target creature, a loss of concentration by the caster, or other factors. An indefinite spell is not perpetual, and a caster’s death does not cause an indefinite spell to end.

###### Object

An object is any piece of armor, equipment, mindless plant (such as a tree), structure, vehicle, or vessel, or anything with structural hit points. The Judge makes the final determination whether a particular thing is worth treating as an object.

###### Perpetual

Perpetual is a spell duration. A perpetual spell lasts until either the caster decides to stop sustaining the spell at the start of his initiative, the caster or the target or recipient creature or creatures die, or the spell is dispelled. (A perpetual spell cast by an object on a creature ends when the creature dies, without regard for the creator’s life or death.) A caster can sustain a maximum of one perpetualspell per caster level for each spell level he can cast. For instance, a 5th level caster could sustain 5 1st, 5 2nd, and 5 3rd perpetual spells. A truly permanent effect requires a **permanency** ritual or magic item.

###### Plant

Plant is a category of creature that includes both ordinary plants such as trees and grass as well as plant-like monsters. It does not include oozes.

###### Recipient

A recipient is a target which willingly subjects itself to the spell targeting it. When a spell can affect both willing recipients and unwilling targets, a recipient is sometimes called a **willing target**.

###### Sapiency

Creatures can be mindless, bestial, semi-sapient, or sapient. Mindless creatures function purely on instinct. Bestial creatures are aware of their environment, can remember past events, and can engage in limited problem-solving, but are not self-aware. Semi-sapient creatures are self-aware but lack one or more of the capabilities of sapient creatures, such as abstract reasoning, grammatical language, or tool use. Sapient creatures are self-aware and capable of abstract reasoning, grammatical language, and tool use. Most constructs, oozes, and vermin are mindless, while most animals are bestial. Some animals, such as apes, elephants, parrots, and ravens, are semi-sapient. Monstrosities can be bestial, semi-sapient, or sapient. Giants and humanoids are always sapient. A creature’s sapiency determines the opportunity and frequency for it to make saving throws against certain spells.

###### Special

Special is a spell duration. A special spell’s duration is described in the spell’s description. Most spells with a special duration are perpetual except insofar as a particular trigger might end them. In other words, they are indefinite perpetual spells. Other special durations occur for spells with variable effects or multiple steps. The exact details will be as noted by the spell.

###### Stationary Concentration

Stationary concentration is a condition required of the caster by some spells. Concentration can be sustained for up to 8 hours per day without penalty; concentrating for up to 12 hours counts as force marching. Stationary concentration ends if a creature takes damage or fails a saving throw (except a secret saving throw it isn’t aware of). The condition also ends if the creature takes any action other than remaining stationary and sustaining the spell.

###### Structure

Some spells can damage structures. For purposes of spells, structures include anything with structural hit points. They exclude objects that do not have structural hit points, such as armor, equipment, or weapons. If a structure is destroyed by a spell with an area of effect, creatures that would have been in the area of effect were they not protected by the structure will take damage. However, the damage is reduced by the amount of shp required to destroy the structure and the creatures save as if they were behind an arrow loop (+4 to save vs. Blast and taking no damage on success).

###### Target

A target is a creature, object, or area of space at which a spell is aimed or directed. The creature, object, or center point of the area must be in spell range and line of sight of the caster in order to be an eligible target of a spell. If the range of the spell is touch, an attack throw might be required to affect the target. Some spells further limit eligible targets to only objects, only creatures, or only creatures of particular sorts. Some spells permit saving throws only for target creatures and not for target objects, or only for target objects carried or worn by a creature.

###### Touch

Touch is a range. When a spell has a touch range, the caster must succeed on an unarmed melee attack throw against the spell’s target when the spell is cast. Unless otherwise noted, the creature’s full AC applies. Touching a recipient creature does not require an attack throw. Self-touching does not require an attack throw but sure could use a better term. The caster can always claim line of sight on a touched creature even if blinded, in darkness, etc.

### Spell Index

###### Adjust Self

Arcane 2 Type: transmogrification

Range: selfDuration: 6 turns + 1 turn/caster level

This spell grants the caster the ability to alter his shape into that of any other humanoid creature. The caster can control his new shape’s physical qualities (such as height, weight, gender, hair color, hair texture, and skin color) within the normal ranges for a creature of its kind. His equipment, if any, remains worn or held where possible, and otherwise melds into the new form. If used in conjunction with a successful Disguise proficiency throw, *adjust self* can allow the caster to appear as a specific individual. The caster must be man-sized or smaller when he casts this spell or it fails to work.

###### Animate Undead

Arcane 4, Divine 4 Type: necromancy

Range: touch Duration: 1 day or permanent

This spell animates the bones or bodies of one or more dead targets, transforming them into undead skeletons or zombies under the caster’s command. The caster can animate a number of Hit Dice of undead equal to twice his caster level each time he casts this spell. Animated skeletons have Hit Dice equal to the Baseline Hit Dice such creatures have in life; for skeletons of humans or demi-humans, this means one Hit Die, regardless of the character level of the deceased. Zombies have one more Hit Die than the creatures’ Baseline HD. An animated skeleton can be created only from a mostly intact skeleton; a zombie can be created only from a mostly intact corpse.

The caster can give verbal orders to the animated undead when they rise and thereafter anytime they are in line of sight on his initiative. Complex or extensive orders require the caster to expend action in lieu of moving, but simple orders (“protect me!”) do not require an action. Orders can be given in any language the caster speaks. The animated undead will mindlessly obey whatever orders they are given to the best of their (limited) ability. They cannot accomplish tasks that require abstract thought or higher reasoning. If they complete all of their orders, or for whatever reason are physically unable to obey their orders, the undead will simply remain stationary until they receive new orders. The undead act on their own initiative each round.

*Animate undead*normally lasts for just one day, after which the creatures’ remains crumble to dust. However, the spellcaster can make the spell permanent by anointing each zombie or skeleton with 1 vial of unholy water per Hit Die. If this is done, the undead are permanently animated until they are destroyed. *Animate undead* is the reverse of *smite undead*.

###### Allure

Divine 1 Type: enchantment

Range: selfDuration: 6 turns

This spell imbues the caster with an enchanting allure of beauty and power. The exact effect can vary depending on the caster’s spell signature. For the duration of the spell, the caster gains the benefits of the Mystic Aura proficiency. If the caster already has the Mystic Aura proficiency, he gains a further +1 bonus to reaction rolls.

###### Angelic Aura

Divine 4 Type: death

Range: selfDuration: 1 round/level

This spell creates a glowing aura of empyrean power around the caster in a 15’ radius. When the spell is cast, and on the caster’s initiative each round thereafter for the duration of the spell, the *angelic aura* can damage undead creatures within its area of effect. Up to one undead creature can be targeted per caster level. Undead creatures with the fewest HD must be targeted first. Any excess HD of effectiveness are lost. When one or more creatures with the same number of HD are eligible to be targets, the caster can choose which are affected. Each targeted undead creature must make a Death saving throw. If the save succeeds, the undead creature avoids the effect that round. If the save fails, the undead creature suffers 5d8 extraordinary luminous damage. The effects of an *angelic aura*continue until dispelledor the duration elapses. The caster does not need to concentrate to maintain the effects.

###### Angelic Choir

Divine 1 Type: illusion

Range: 45’ Duration: 6 turns

This spell creates an auditory illusion of choir music. The **angelic choir** can produce a volume of sound ranging from a soloist to an entire chorus of 64 singers of a variety of vocal types. The music can originate from any place within range of the caster. The melody, harmony, and volume of the **angelic choir** are controlled by the caster. Any lyrics will be impossible to precisely decipher, regardless of what language they are sung in. The **angelic choir** can continue for up to 1 hour (6 turns), but ceases immediately if the caster attacks or is attacked.

**Angelic choir** is primarily used by priestesses to impress their congregants during benedictions and holy rites, but some adventurers hire priestesses to cast it from the rear ranks to ensure their epic adventures are accompanied by appropriately epic music.

###### Anti-Magic Sphere

Arcane 6 , Divine 6 Type: protection

Range: selfDuration: 12 turns

This spell creates a personal barrier about the caster that stops any spell or spell-like effects (including the caster’s) from coming in or going out. Spell-like effects include all effects that duplicate a spell, or magical effects that are resisted with a Spells or Implements saving throw, but excludes effects that do not duplicate a spell and are resisted with Death, Blast, or Paralysis saves. Spells with a range of “self,” or “touch” spells used on the caster himself, are not blocked by his *anti-magic sphere*. If a creature or item with an ongoing spell or spell-like effect enters an *anti-magic sphere*, the spell or effect can be dispelled as if by a *dispel magic*from the caster. However, permanent effects or effects which cannot be dispelled are not affected. An *anti-magic sphere* lasts until **dispelled** or 12 turns lapse. However, the caster can decide to extinguish the sphere at any time during his initiative each round.

###### Arcane Armor

Arcane 1 Type: protection

Range: selfDuration: 3 turns

This spell creates a weightless and invisible suit of armor that protects the caster. The *arcane armor* negates *mage missile* attacks directed at the caster, and guarantees the caster AC 7 against missile attacks and AC 5 against melee attacks. The *arcane armor* stacks with modifiers to AC from DEX but not with modifiers to AC from armor, class powers, conditions, magic, or proficiencies. Conditions which improve an opponent’s attack throw against the creatures they affect (e.g., **flanked** or **vulnerable**) are not affected by *arcane armor*.

###### Arcane Shift

Arcane 4 Type: movement

Range: 15’Duration: instantaneous

This spell instantly teleports the caster, or a single target creature within range, to a destination within 360’ of the caster’s or target’s present location. The caster can designate the destination by accurately visualizing it, by stating direction and distance, or (if it is within line of sight) by looking at the spot. If the destination is within a creature or solid object, the spell automatically fails. Otherwise, the caster or target creature arrives at exactly the spot desired. Anything worn or carried by the caster or target will be teleported as well, including one or more other creatures carried by or mounted on the teleported creature.

A target that wishes to avoid being teleported can make a Spells saving throw. If the save succeeds, the target resists being teleported. If the save fails, the target is teleported.

EXAMPLE: Elaria is charged by a war elephant carrying a rider and a howdah with four archers. When the war elephant gets to within 10’, Elaria casts **arcane shift** on it in an attempt to send it 360’ up in the air. The war elephant doesn’t want to beteleported, so it makes a Spells saving throw. Unfortunately, the save fails. Therefore the war elephant, its rider, and all the archers are all instantly teleported upward 360’.

###### Arrows of the Sun

Divine 6 Type: blast, elemental (fire)

Range: 180’ Duration: 1 round

This spellsets aflame the nocked arrows of friendly archers within range. Up to 20 arrows can be set aflame per caster level. A flaming arrowdeals an extra 1d6 points of fire damage on a successful attack. If a flaming arrow is not immediately shot, its flame harmlessly goes out at the end of the round, returning the arrow to an ordinary weapon.

This spell was created for battlefield use. In ***Domains at War: Battles****,* it can affect a friendly bow-equipped unit within six hexes of the caster’s hex. That unit deals an extra point of damage on each successful bow attack throw during its next attack sequence.

###### Atonement

Divine 5 Type: esoteric, healing

Range: touchDuration: instantaneous

This spell removes the spiritual burden of unwilling evil acts or misdeeds from the recipient. The recipient must be truly repentant and desirous of setting right its misdeeds or the spell fails. *Atonement* can reverse magical alignment changes or restore the class powers of divine casters who have strayed from their code of behavior. Because of the complexity of the prayers involved in *atonement*, the spell takes 1 turn to cast.

###### Auditory Illusion

Arcane 1 Type: illusion

Range: 30’Duration: 1 round per level

This spell creates a false sound. The sound can be centered anywhere within range, and within that range the sound can fluctuate and move, imitating approaching or receding footsteps, laughter, voices, and other possibilities. The caster can dynamically control the sound if he is within range of it. The sound produced can be as loud as the noise produced by thirty man-sized creatures. The *auditory illusion* does not have to be human-like; it can replicate animal cries, monstrous roars, trickling water, and other sounds. The Judge should determine how much sound and how many individuals it might represent. For instance, the sounds of thirty humans might be approximately that of sixty children, or eight ogres.

A creature who has reason to be suspicious about the reality of the sound can make a Spells saving throw to disbelieve it at the start of its initiative. If the save succeeds, the creature learns the sound is an illusion and can hear any sound it might be concealing. If the save fails, the creature continues to believe it is real. The creature cannot attempt to disbelieve the *auditory illusion*again until it has further evidence of its illusory nature (e.g. a friend tells him “it’s an illusion,” etc.)

At the caster’s discretion, the spell can be cast so that its duration does not begin until a particular trigger is met. The trigger can be as general or as detailed as desired, although only visual and audible triggers can be used. Triggers react to what appears to be the case. Disguises and illusions can fool them. Normal darkness does not defeat a visual trigger, but magical *tenebrosity* or *invisibility* does. Silent movement or magical silence defeats audible triggers. Audible triggers can be keyed to general types of noises or to a specific noise or spoken word. Actions can serve as triggers if they are visible or audible. The trigger cannot distinguish level, Hit Dice, or class except by external garb. The illusion can respond to triggers as far as 45’ away. Regardless of range, the illusion can respond only to visible or audible triggers and actions in line of sight or within hearing distance.

When the spell is cast with a trigger, the caster must specify sound that it will make in advance, in case he is not there to dynamically control it. (If he is within range when it is triggered, he can dynamically control the sound.) The point at which the *auditory illusion* is centered will be noticeable with *discern magic* and the effect can be **dispelled** by targeting that point**.**

###### Augury

Divine 2 Type: detection, esoteric

Range: selfDuration: instantaneous

This spell can allow the caster to foresee whether a particular action is likely to bring about good or bad results. Auguries are not always accurate, however. When the spell is cast, the Judge secretly makes a magic research throw on behalf of the caster. A natural roll of at least 7 always succeeds. If the throw succeeds, the augury is true and reliable. If the throw fails, the augury is false and misleading. In addition, the *augury* can see into the future only 3 turns, so anything that might happen after that does not affect the result. Thus, the result will not take into account the long-term consequences of a contemplated action.

EXAMPLE: Zeodarë casts *augury*to assess whether opening a treasure chest she’s discovered is likely to bring about a good or bad result. The Judge secretly makes a magic research throw on her behalf and rolls an 11, so her augury is true. The Judge knows that the chest is not locked or trapped, and contains 4,000gp. Therefore, he tells her that opening the chest will bring about a good result. The fact that the gold coins belong to a murderous assassin who will come hunting for her when he discovers they have been stolen is not reflected in the *augury*, because that event won’t happen in the next half hour.

###### Avian Messenger

Arcane 3, Divine 3 Type: summoning, transmogrification

Range: specialDuration: 12 hours

This spell allows the caster to relay a message to a recipient by means of an *avian messenger***.** The *messenger* will be a small winged creature capable of long-distance flight. The spell will conscript the nearest suitable creature to serve as the *avian messenger*so it might be, e.g., a pigeon, a raven, a bat, or even a dragonfly, depending on what is nearby when the spell is cast. As soon as the spell is cast, the *avian messenger* will begin traveling to the caster, typically arriving within 2d6 rounds. If the avian messenger is somehow prevented from reaching the caster (e.g. if he is imprisoned deep underground), it will circle in the vicinity until it is able to reach him or until the spell expires.

Once the *avian messenger*reaches the caster, it will wait up to 10 minutes (one turn) for the caster to whisper his desired message into its ear. If the caster fails to whisper a message into the *messenger*’s ear within 10 minutes, the spell ends and the creature flies off. The *avian messenger*can understand any language(s) the caster speaks, and remember a message up to 1 minute (one round) long per level of the caster.

Once the caster has finished whispering his message, he must designate a recipient for the message. The caster must know the proper name or identifying title of the recipient and the location of his residence (either firsthand, from scrying, or from a map). Once the recipient has been designated, the *avian messenger*will begin traveling to the recipient’s residence. The *avian messenger* will travel for up to 12 hours at a rate of 48 miles per hour in order to reach the recipient’s residence. If the recipient is present when the *messenger*arrives, it will whisper the message into his ear in whatever language the caster spoke. If the recipient is absent, or somehow inaccessible (e.g. in a windowless room), the *avian messenger* will circle in the vicinity until it is able to reach him or until the spell expires.

###### Bane-Rune

Divine 1 Type: transmogrification

Range: touchDuration: 1 turn

This spell inscribes a baleful glyph on to the target weapon or weapons touched. A maximum of 20 arrows, 2 tiny melee weapons, or 1 small, medium, or large melee weapon can be affected with each casting. The affected weapon or weapons are temporarily enhanced to the equivalent of a **magic weapon +2** against a particular type of creature. The type of creature is chosen by the caster when the spell is cast: animals, beastmen, constructs, dragons, giants, humanoids (excluding beastmen), incarnations, monstrosities (excluding dragons), oozes, plants, undead, or vermin. Weapons that are already magic gain an additional +1 against the type of creature while the spell is in effect.

###### Banner of Invincibility

Arcane 6, Divine 6 Type: protection

Range: touchDuration: 1 turn

This spell imbues a target banner, pennant, standard, or other flag touched by the caster with powerful protective magic. While the spell is in effect, any missile or melee attacks dealing mundane damage targeted at the bearer of the target flag or any of the bearer’s allies within 10’ of the flag are deflected and automatically miss. If the deflected attack has an area of effect, roll for scatter to determine the direction and distance deflected; however, the center point of the area of effect must be at least 10’ from the flag bearer. The protected creatures can still be harmed if the area of effect is so large that it can affect them despite being at least 10’ from the flag. Attacks made with silver weapons are considered to deal extraordinary damage for purposes of this spell.

Bearing the *banner of invincibility* counts as wielding a weapon or shield (i.e. the flag bearer can bear the flag in one hand and either wield a one-handed weapon or a shield in his other hand). The spell ends if the bearer drops the flag (voluntarily or involuntarily), if the flag is destroyed, if the spell is **dispelled**, or otherwise when the duration expires.

If used during a battle, the *banner of invincibility* can protect all man-sized creatures in a platoon-sized unit of formed foot. The unit cannot be hit by missile or melee attacks from units of less than 5 Baseline HD without appropriate weapons, and is never considered threatened by enemy units that are unable to damage it. The effect ends if the unit ever recoils, flees, or routs.

###### Barrier of Blades

Divine 6 Type: wall

Range: 120’Duration: concentration

This spell conjures a *barrier of blades*made of thousands of flying swords for the duration of the spell. The barrier of blades can be as large as 500 square feet and can be almost any shape the caster desires, provided the entire barrier is within the spell’s range and the caster does not evoke the wall such that it appears on or on top of creatures or objects.

The barrier is only as thick as the blades that constitute it, but since the blades slash and whirl continuously, anyone who approaches is at grave risk of harm. Any creatures that start their initiative or move within 5’ of the *barrier of blades* are subject to attack as if from a readied 4 HD monster with one attack dealing 2d6 extraordinary slashing damage. Any creature passing through the wall automatically suffers 2d6 extraordinary slashing damage. The barrier does not block light, movement, or vision. It cannot be affected by physical or magical attacks and is invulnerable to mundane and extraordinary damage.

If not **dispelled**, **disintegrated**, or otherwise destroyed, the barrier remains so long as the caster maintain concentration on it. The concentrating caster can move the barrier up to 20’ in any desired direction in range on her initiative each round. If this movement causes the barrier to pass over any creatures, those creatures suffer 2d6 extraordinary slashing damage, as above. Note that it is possible for a creature to be attacked at the start of its initiative by the barrier from his front side; automatically damaged by the barrier as it passes over him on the caster’s initiative; and then attacked again by the barrier on the creature’s initiative.

This spell is designed for use on battlefields. An 8.25’ tall, 60’ wide barrier of blades can destroy an entire company by moving through the troops.

###### Bath of the Goddess

Divine 6 Type: transmogrification

Range: touchDuration: perpetual

This spellinstantly transforms a living recipient of man-size or smaller into the opposite sex. The recipient gains all of the primary and secondary characteristics of its new sex (external and internal, including reproductive capacity if of breeding age), resembling an opposite-gender twin of its old self.

If the recipient has been sexually altered (e.g. a eunuch), it will suffer an equivalent alteration to its new form. If the recipient belongs to a species that has only one sex, the spell has no effect. If the recipient belongs to a species that has multiple sexes, or is an intersexed creature of a predominantly sex-binary species, the caster chooses the sex that results. (A male or female creature could be transformed into an intersexed creature by this spell if desired. It is rumored that some mystery cults require this of their high-level religious figures.)

The spell is perpetual until **dispelled** by *counterspell*or *dispel magic*, or by a second casting of this spell, at which time the subject reverts to its original sex. The spell becomes permanent if the creature births or sires children in the manner of its new sex.

No actual bathing is required to cast this spell; it just takes its name from a classical myth about a handsome priest who was transformed into a bladedancer after unintentionally bathing in a moon-lit pond in which Ianna herself had recently bathed.

###### Battering Ram

Arcane 2 Type: blast, elemental (earth)

Range: 120’Duration: instantaneous

This spell smashes a target with an invisible battering ram. The target must be made of wood or stone, be larger than man-sized, and have at least 1 structural hit point. Common targets are battlements, doors, walls, war machines, and vessels. It cannot target areas of open ground. It can only target an interior floor of wood or stone if the caster is at least one story above the floor.

The *battering ram* deals extraordinary seismic structural damage, 1d4 to a stone target or 1d4x5 to a wooden one — sufficient to knock down an oak door, break off a parapet, etc. The impact of the *battering ram* blasts shards of stone or splinters of wood from the target in a 5’ radius. Each creature in the area of effect must make a Blast saving throw. If the save fails, the creature suffers 1d6 piercing damage per caster level (maximum 5d6). If the save succeeds, the creature suffers half that damage.

###### Beguile Humanoid

Arcane 1 , Divine 2 Type: enchantment

Range: 90’Duration: 1 day

This spell can bewitch a living humanoid target with fewer than 5 HD. The target creature must make a Spells saving throw. If it or its allies are being threatened or attacked by the caster or his allies when the spell is cast, it receives a +5 bonus on its saving throw. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect. If the save fails, the target is **bewitched**.

Once bewitched, the creature feels that the caster is a beloved friend and trusted comrade. It will interpret anything the caster says or does in the most favorable manner, confabulating plausible justifications for the actions taken. If a fight breaks out between the caster and its allies, the creature will spend one round attempting to verbally defuse the fight, then thereafter fight against whichever side initiated the violence, making nonlethal attacks if possible. In more peaceful circumstances, the bewitchedcreature might agree to cover up the caster’s activities, allow him access to restricted areas, risk its own life to save his, or do any of the other foolish things that people sometimes do for their friends despite their better judgment. The Judge can use the Loyalty rules for henchmen (p. XX) to assess the bewitched creature’s response to dangerous or unusual requests.

However, the caster can neither control the bewitched creature like an automaton nor give it orders like a hireling, and attempting to do so can give the creature an additional saving throw to resist the spell (Judge’s discretion). Moreover, the spell does not provide any special means for the caster to communicate with the bewitched creature. If the caster does not speak any languages known to the creature, he can crudely communicate with grunts, gestures, and pantomime.

Once in effect, the spell lasts until **dispelled** or until 1 day elapses. It can be dispelled normally, and can be detected with *discern bewitchment*,but cannot be detected with *discern magic*.

Once the spell ends, the affected humanoid will be hostile to the caster if it was forced to risk its life without fair reward or otherwise harmed or maltreated. A bewitched humanoid that was treated kindly and respectfully might remain neutral or friendly (Judge’s discretion).

###### Bewitch Beast

Divine 2 Type: enchantment

Range: 90’Duration: indefinite

This spell can bewitch a living animal target. The target must make a Spells saving throw. If the target or its allies are being threatened or attacked by the caster or his allies when the spell is cast, it receives a +5 bonus on its saving throw. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect. If the save fails, the target is **bewitched**. The effect is identical to that of *beguile humanoid*, above.

Once in effect, the bewitchment lasts until **dispelled** or until the animal makes a successful Spells saving throw. The bewitched animal receives a saving throw to break the spell each day if it has 9 HD or more, every week if it has 5 – 8 HD, and every month if it has fewer than 5 HD. This spell does not grant the caster any special means of communication with the affected animal; if combined with *speak with beasts*, this spell becomes significantly more useful. A bewitchment can be detected with *discern bewitchment*,but cannot be detected with *discern magic*.

Once the spell ends, the affected animal will be hostile to the caster if it was forced to risk its life without fair reward or otherwise harmed or maltreated. A bewitched animal that was used kindly might remain neutral or friendly (Judge’s discretion).

###### Bewitch Crowd

Arcane 3 Type: enchantment

Range: 90’Duration: indefinite

This spell can bewitch any living humanoid targets with fewer than 2 HD situated within a 20’ diameter sphere centered on a target point. Each target in the sphere must make a Spells saving throw. If the target or its allies are being threatened or attacked by the caster or his allies when the spell is cast, it receives a +5 bonus on its saving throw. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect. If the save fails, the target is **bewitched**. The effect is identical to that of *beguile humanoid*, above.

Once in effect, the bewitchments lasts on each creature until **dispelled** or until it makes a successful Spells saving throw against the spell. A bewitched creature receives another Spells saving throw each day if it is has an Intellect of 13 or greater, each week if it has an Intellect of 9 – 12, or each month it its Intellect is 8 or less. A bewitchment can be detected with *discern bewitchment*,but cannot be detected with *discern magic*.

Once the spell ends, the affected humanoid will be hostile to the caster if it was asked to risk its life without fair reward or otherwise harmed or maltreated. A bewitched humanoid that was treated kindly and respectfully might remain neutral or friendly (Judge’s discretion).

Once in effect, the bewitchments lasts until **dispelled** or until the creature makes a successful Spells saving throw against it.

Once the spell ends, the affected creature will be hostile to the caster if it was forced to risk its life without fair reward or otherwise harmed or maltreated. A bewitched creature that was treated kindly and respectfully might remain neutral or friendly (Judge’s discretion).

###### Blast Ward

Arcane 5, Divine 5 Type: protection

If the save fails, the target begins vomiting blood. A **vomiting** creature cannot take any actions or speak (though it can defend itself). At the start of its initiative, the vomiting creature suffers 1d12 extraordinary necrotic damage from its gory retching, then makes another Death saving throw. If the save succeeds, the spell ends. If the save fails, the target continues vomiting. The *bloody flux*continues until the effect is dispelled, the creature dies, or the creature successfully saves. The caster does not need to concentrate to maintain the effect.

###### Body Swap

Arcane 6 Type: necromancy, transmogrification

Range: touchDuration: perpetual

This spell can cause a pair of living targets of man-size or smaller to perpetually take on each other’s forms. Each target gains the physical capabilities, statistics, physical attacks, and special abilities of the new form while retaining its own mental abilities. Each target retains the same number of hit points it previously had, regardless of the Hit Dice of the form assumed.

Incorporeal and gaseous creatures cannot be targeted by this spell, nor can creatures with more HD than caster level. The caster must touch both creatures when casting the spell. The caster may be one of the creatures touched, if he desires. Since touching an unwilling creature requires a successful attack throw, this spell is usually cast only when one or both of the creatures are willing and/or helpless. Each creature can (if unwilling) make a Spells saving throw to resist the *body swap*. If either creature saves, the spell has no effect.

Once the *body swap*occurs, it lasts perpetually until the caster dies or it is **dispelled**. If dispelled, the two creatures immediately swap back to their original forms. If the *body swap*is dispelledafter one of the creatures has died, then the surviving creature must make a Death saving throw. If the throw fails, the creature returns to its original (dead) form and dies. If the save succeeds, the surviving creature retains the new form.

###### Boil Blood

If the save fails, the creature is **stunned** until the end of its next initiative and suffers 1d8 extraordinary fire damage per caster level (maximum 8d8). On a successful save the creature suffers half damage and is not stunned.

In either case, if the target is reduced to 0 hp or less by the spell, the creature detonates in an explosion of boiling blood, scalding puss, and melted organs. The explosion kills the target instantly. Each creature within 5’ of the exploding target must make a Blast saving throw. If the save fails, the creature suffers 1d6 extraordinary fire damage. If the save succeeds, the creature suffers half that damage. Theexplosion also damages objects in the area and sets combustible materials alight.

###### Call of the Aerophract Steeds

Divine 6 Type: summoning (call)

Range: specialDuration: 1 day

This spell calls a herd of **pegasi** to the caster to serve as a steeds for him and his companions (see the ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual*** for details). Two pegasi will respond to the call per caster level. For instance, a 14th level caster will summon 28 pegasi.

The spell takes one turn (10 minutes) to cast. As soon as the spell is cast, the pegasi begin to travel from their den(s) to the caster’s destination at their expedition speed. Unless the Judge has placed a herd of pegasi nearby, the pegasi’s dens will be 4d10 6-mile hexes from the caster’s location. The pegasi will travel to the caster at a rate of 4 hexes per hour. The time to arrival might be much shorter if the Judge has determined that a herd of pegasi is nearby. If called while the caster is unreachable (deep in a dungeon, for example), the pegasi will travel as close as they can to the caster and then wait in that vicinity.

For the duration of the spell, the pegasi will understand the caster’s speech and serve as his loyal friends and companions, acting as if they were the caster’s henchman. They can be handled as mounts, war mounts, or work beasts as if trained in that role. The spell persists until the pegasi are slain, the spell is **dispelled**, or one day passes (at which time the pegasi depart). If the spell is cast again when the pegasi are about to depart, they will remain for another day.*Call of the aerophract steeds* can only be cast once per day.

This spell does notconjure up saddle and tack, nor does it automatically grant the rider the equivalent of Riding proficiency, so an unproficient character who rides the pegasi into battle does so at his own risk.

A prayerful caster who uses a *call* with ill intent towards the creatures called immediately becomes **disfavored.** He cannot use cast the spell again until he has restored himself to favor. A studious caster who uses a *call* with ill intent immediately loses the spell from his repertoire. (He can re-learn it if he has the formula.) In neither case does the called animal arrive.

###### Call of the Ancient Tusk

Divine 6 Type: summoning (call)

Range: specialDuration: 1 day

The spell takes one turn (10 minutes) to cast. As soon as the spell is cast, the mammoths begin to travel to the caster’s destination at their expedition speed. If the spell is cast in an unsettled hex of terrain with an indigenous mammoth or elephant population, the mammoths will take 1d6 turns to arrive. If the spell is cast in any other type of hex, the time to arrive is increased by 120 minutes (12 turns) per 6-mile hex between the caster’s hex and the nearest unsettled hex of native terrain. The time to arrival may be much shorter if the Judge has determined that a mammoth lair is nearby. If called while the caster is unreachable (deep in a dungeon, for example), the mammoths will travel as close as it can to the caster and then wait in that vicinity.

For the duration of the spell, the mammoths will understand the spellcaster’s speech and serve as his loyal friends and companions, acting as if it were the caster’s henchman. They can be ridden as mount or war mounts as if trained in that role. The spell persists until all the mammoths are slain, the spell is **dispelled**, or one day passes (at which time the mammoths depart). If the spell is cast again when the mammoths are about to depart, they will remain for another day. *Call of the ancient tusk* can only be cast once per day.

This spell does notconjure up saddle and tack, nor does it automatically grant the rider the equivalent of Riding proficiency, so unproficient characters who ride the mammoth into battle do so at their own risk.

The time to arrival may be much shorter if the Judge has determined that a herd of horses is nearby. If called while the caster is unreachable (deep in a dungeon, for example), the horses will travel as close as they can to the caster and then wait in that vicinity.

For the duration of the spell, the horses will understand the caster’s speech and serve as his loyal friends and companions, acting as if they were the caster’s henchmen.

The time to arrival may be much shorter if the Judge has determined that a wolf den is nearby. If called while the caster is unreachable (deep in a dungeon, for example), the wolf will travel as close as it can to the caster and then wait in that vicinity.

For the duration of the spell, the wolf will understand the caster’s speech and serve as his loyal friend and companion, acting as if it were the caster’s henchman. It can be handled as a guard or hunter as if trained in that role. The spell persists until the wolfis slain, the spell is **dispelled**, or one day passes (at which time the wolf departs). If the spell is cast again when the wolf is about to depart, it will remain for another day. *Call of the wolf* can only be cast once per day.

A prayerful caster who uses a *call* with ill intent towards the creatures called immediately becomes **disfavored.** He cannot use cast the spell again until he has restored himself to favor. A studious caster who uses a *call* with ill intent immediately loses the spell from his repertoire. (He can re-learn it if he has the formula.) In neither case does the called animal arrive.

###### Call of the Wolf Pack

Divine 2 Type: summoning (call)

Range: specialDuration: 1 day

This spell calls a pack of **wolves** to the caster to serve as companions (see the ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual*** for details). Two wolves will respond to the call at caster level 3, plus one additional wolf for every two caster levels above the caster possesses, rounded down.

The spell takes one turn (10 minutes) to cast. As soon as the spell is cast, the wolves begin to travel to the caster’s destination at their expedition speed. If called in an unsettled hex of their native terrain (woods, hills, or mountains), the wolves will take 1d6 turns to arrive. If the spell is cast in any other type of hex, the time to arrive is increased by 90 minutes (9 turns) per 6-mile hex between the caster’s hex and the nearest unsettled hex of native terrain. The time to arrival may be much shorter if the Judge has determined that a wolf den is nearby. If called while the caster is unreachable (deep in a dungeon, for example), the wolves will travel as close as it can to the caster and then wait in that vicinity.

For the duration of the spell, the wolves will understand the caster’s speech and serve as his loyal friends and companions, acting as if they were the caster’s henchmen. The spell persists until all the wolvesare slain, the spell is **dispelled**, or one day passes (at which time the wolf departs). If the spell is cast again when the wolves are about to depart, they will remain for another day.*Call of the wolf pack* can only be cast once per day.

A prayerful caster who uses a *call* with ill intent towards the creatures called immediately becomes **disfavored.** He cannot use cast the spell again until he has restored himself to favor. A studious caster who uses a *call* with ill intent immediately loses the spell from his repertoire. (He can re-learn it if he has the formula.) In neither case does the called animal arrive.

###### Capsizing Wave

Arcane 5 Type: blast, elemental (water)

Range: 225’Duration: instantaneous

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Vessel Speed** | **Seafaring Throw** |
| 960’ or faster | 9+ |
| 900’ | 11+ |
| 840’ | 13+ |
| 780’ | 15+ |
| 720’ | 17+ |
| 640’ or slower | 19+ |

This spell can smash a target sea vessel with a *capsizing wave* capable of sinking even the largest sailing ships. On his initiative number, the captain of the target vessel can use an action in lieu of attacking to attempt to steer through the wave. Steering through the wave requires a Seafaring proficiency throw. The target value of the proficiency throw is based on the combat speed of the vessel, as shown on the accompanying table. Master mariners (characters with Seafaring rank 3) gain a +4 bonus on the throw.

If the captain’s proficiency throw succeeds, the vessel suffers 25 – 40 (1d4+4 x 5) bludgeoning structural damage. If the captain’s proficiency throw fails, or if the captain does not attempt to steer the vessel through the wave, the vessel is struck on its broadside by the wave. The vessel suffers 250 – 400 (1d4+4 x 50) bludgeoning structural damage and each crewmember or other creature on deck must make a Blast saving throw. If the save fails, the creature suffers 1d6 bludgeoning damage and is swept overboard. If the save succeeds, the creature takes no damage and remains on the deck. The wave vanishes back into the water as soon as its crest passes the target vessel.

A vessel reduced to 0 shp may no longer move under its own power or attack with any vessel-mounted weaponry, and will sink in 1d10 rounds. Any crew remaining on board may still attack with personal weapons during this time. When the vessel sinks, or when knocked overboard, crew must begin making swimming throws each round. See Swimming and Drowning (p. XX) for more details.

EXAMPLE: Ra-Ramses sees Raknar the Red-Handed sailing towards his island sanctum at the helm of his longship, the Red Viper (30 shp). When Raknar’s vessel gets to a range of 150’, Ra-Ramses smashes it with a *capsizing wave*. On Raknar’s initiative, he attempts to steer through the wave. Raknar’s longship is under sail with a sail speed of 720’. Therefore he must make a Seafaring proficiency throw with a target value of 17+. Fortunately, Raknar has three ranks of Seafaring proficiency, granting him a +5 bonus to the throw. Unfortunately, he rolls a 3, which still fails. The Red Viper is struck on its broadside and suffers 1d4+4 x 50 bludgeoning structural damage. Ra-Ramses rolls a 1, so the total is 250 shp. That reduces the longship to well below 0 shp, and it will sink in 1d10 rounds.

Meanwhile, Raknar and his 75 crew must each make a Blast saving throw. Those that fail suffer 1d6 bludgeoning damage and are swept overboard. Raknar’s ill-luck continues as he fails his saving throw. The barbarian is carried into the murky waters…

###### Carnage

Arcane 5 Type: death

Range: 225’Duration: instantaneous

This spell can massacre and maim one or more humanoid targets. Up to 4d8 HD of humanoids with fewer than 2 HD can be targeted by the spell. Creatures with less than 1 HD count as 1/2 HD each. Creatures with the fewest HD must be targeted first. The caster does not have to use the full HD available. Any excess HD of effectiveness are lost. When one or more creatures with the same number of HD are eligible to be targets, the caster can choose which are affected.

Each target humanoid must make a Death saving throw. If the save fails, the target is instantly torn apart in a shower of blood and gore. If the save succeeds, the target suffers 2d4 extraordinary necrotic damage and must immediately roll on the Savage Mortal Woundstable and suffer the result listed under Permanent Wounds Suffered. (The target does not suffer from the results listed in the Condition & Recovery column.) When rolling on the Mortal Wound table due to *carnage*, the only modifiers that apply are those from CON and HD.

Note that this spell indiscriminately slaughters its targets. It does not afford the caster any way to differentiate friend from foe except insofar as he chooses to use fewer than the full HD available or he has two creatures as eligible targets with the same HD and not enough excess HD to affect them both.

EXAMPLE: Ra-Ramses is a 14th level mage, accompanied by his 0th level henchmen Thotep and his 1st level henchman Flavian. Ra-Ramses and his henchmen enter an open-air marketplace where 46 0th-level merchants are offering goods, supervised by one 1st level fighter. Ra-Ramses decides it would be easier to massacre them all than to barter for the goods he wants, so he casts *carnage*. After completing the spell, Ra-Ramses rolls 4d8, scoring an exceptional 5, 5, 7, and 8 on the dice. A total of 25 HD of creatures can be targeted. Ra-Ramses must target the creatures with fewest HD first, but can choose between eligible targets with the same HD. He first targets the 46 0th level merchants. That uses up 23 of his 25 HD of creatures. He’d like to target the 1st level fighter guarding the market place, but to do so he would first have to target 0th level Thotep. Ra-Ramses graciously accepts Thotep’s sacrifice for the cause and targets the hapless henchmen. Ra-Ramses has now used 23 1/2 of his 25 HD. He now targets the fighter, which uses up another 1/2 of his 25 HD. He has only 1/2 HD remaining, which is not enough to target anyone else. The excess 1/2 HD is wasted.

###### Chameleon

Arcane 1 Type: transmogrification

Range: touchDuration: 1 turn/caster level

This spell allows the recipient to blend into its surroundings to the point of becoming nearly invisible. If the creature is not proficient in Hiding, it becomes proficient with a Hiding proficiency throw of 12+. If the creature is already proficient in Hiding, it gains a +8 bonus to its Hiding proficiency throws. The recipient must be man-sized or smaller when this spell is cast or it fails to work.

###### Chimerical Figment

Arcane 3 , Divine 5 Type: illusion

Range: 360’Duration: concentration + 2 rounds

This spell creates the visual and auditory illusion of an area, object, creature, or force, as visualized by the caster, up to a maximum size of 30’ x 30’ x 30’. The illusion does not create smell, texture, or temperature. The caster can move the figment within the limits of the area of the effect. The image persists so long as the caster maintains concentration, plus an additional 2 rounds after the caster ceases to concentrate, expiring at the end of the caster’s second initiative.

If used to create the illusion of one or more creatures, the illusory creatures have AC 0 and 1 hp; they immediately disappear if hit in combat. If used to simulate an attack spell or an attacking creature, the illusory attack and damage done should be resolved by the Judge as if it were real. However, any creature affected by illusory damage receives a Spells saving throw to disbelieve the illusion (with a bonus for any senses lacking, see below). If the save succeeds, the creature takes no damage and realizes the *chimerical figment* is an illusion. If the save fails, the creature believes it has been damaged, possibly fainting into unconsciousness if it believes its hit points have been reduced to 0 or fewer. However, the illusory damage is not real. A “killed” or “injured” creature realizes it is unharmed at the end of its initiative in 1d3 rounds, and thereafter knows the *chimerical figment*is an illusion.

A creature who encounters a *chimerical figment* and has reason to be suspicious about its reality can make a Spells saving throw to disbelieve it at the start of its initiative. The creature gains a +4 bonus if the area, object, creature, or force being simulated should have smell, texture, or temperature, provided the creature can tell the figment does not have those qualities. If the save succeeds, the creature confirms the *chimerical**figment* is an illusion and can see and hear anything the figment is concealing. If the save fails, the creature continues to believe it is real. The creature cannot attempt to disbelieve the *chimerical**figment*again until it has further evidence of its illusory nature (e.g. a friend tells him “it’s an illusion,” he discovers it lacks temperature, etc.).

###### Choking Grip

Arcane 1 , Divine 2 Type: death

Range: 45’Duration: special

This spell can place an invisible grip around the throat of a living target. The target must make a Death saving throw. If the save succeeds, the target resists the spell. If the save fails, the target begins **choking**. It immediately suffers 1d6 extraordinary necrotic damage and thereafter cannot take any actions or speak (although it can still defend itself) until the *choking**grip*ends.

When the caster’s next initiative number comes up, if the caster maintains concentration on the spell, then the choking target must make another Death saving throw. If the save succeeds, the spell ends. If the save fails, the target continues **choking**. It suffers another 1d6 extraordinary necrotic damage and still cannot take any action. The *choking grip* lasts until **dispelled**, the caster stops concentrating upon it, or the target makes a successful saving throw and ends the spell.

The target of this spell must be a living animal, giant, humanoid, monstrosity, or other creature that respirates through a windpipe. If cast on another type of living creature, such as an ooze or vermin, the spell automatically fails.

###### Circle of Agony

Arcane 5 Type: death

Range: 45’Duration: indefinite

This spell can inflict agonizing pain on one, two, three, four, or five living target(s) of the caster’s choice. Each target must make a Death saving throw. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect on the target. If the save fails, the target becomes **helpless** with agony.

At the start of its initiative, each creature made helpless by this spell suffers 1d4 extraordinary necrotic damage from body-wracking pain and then makes another Death saving throw. If the save succeeds, the spell ends for that creature. If the save fails, the creature remains helpless. The effects of a *circle of agony*continue until **dispelled**, orthe target(s) either die(s) or successfully save(s). The caster does not need to concentrate to maintain the effects.

###### Circling Winds

Arcane 2 , Divine 2 Type: elemental (air), protection, wall

Range: selfDuration: concentration

This spell raises a sphere of howling winds that surround the caster at a 10’ radius. Any creatures that start their initiative or move within 5’ of the exterior of the *circling winds* are subject to attack as if from a readied 2 HD monster with one attack dealing 1d8 extraordinary slashing damage. Any creatures that attempt to pass into the *circling**winds* must make a Paralysis saving throw or be forced back 5’ from the nearest edge. (Creatures of Large size or greater gain a +4 bonus to the saving throw per size category above man-sized.) The *circling**winds* do not attack or force back creatures inside the radius of the spell.

The *circling**winds* deflect missile attacks dealing mundane damage which are directed at the caster or other creatures inside the radius of the spell. Missile attacks include, e.g., arrows, boulders, bolts, bullets, and thrown objects. The deflected missile attacks automatically miss their target. If the deflected attack has an area of effect, roll for scatter to determine the direction and distance deflected (see p. XX for scatter). Creatures within the *circling**winds* can still be harmed if they ends up in the area of effect after deflection. Attacks made with silver weapons are considered to deal extraordinary damage for purposes of this spell.

The *circling**winds*do not block missile attacks made by creatures inside the winds, nor do they prevent creatures inside the winds from exiting. The *circling**winds*can be evoked so that they appear where creatures already are. Affected creatures must make a Blast saving throw. If the save succeeds, the creature can dive into or out of the *circling**winds*(its choice) without being harmed. If the save fails, the creature is attacked as above and then forced back 5’ from the nearest edge of the circling winds.

The *circling**winds* spell lasts as long as the caster maintains stationary concentration or until **dispelled**.

###### Clairaudiency

Arcane 3 , Divine 3 Type: detection

Range: 90’Duration: 12 turns

This spell enables the caster to hear the sounds in another area through the ears of a living target in that area. The spell can be cast in one of two ways:

* The caster can specify a point in space in a given direction and distance, up to a maximum of 90’ away. The point does not need to be in line of sight. The closest living creature to that point within 90’ of the caster becomes the target. If there is no living creature within 90’ of the caster, the spell automatically fails.
* The caster can specify a living creature in range and line of sight. That creature becomes the target of the spell.

The target does not receive a saving throw and is unaware that it is being used by the caster. Once If the target moves out of range of the caster, the caster can no longer hear sounds through its ears, but can choose another target in this case. Otherwise, once per turn, the caster can choose another target for the spell, using either of the methods above, thereby enabling multiple locations to be heard.

The caster must concentrate to use *clairaudiency***,** and he cannot hear sounds through his own ears while doing so. However, the spell does not end if he stops concentrating, so he can revert to hearing with his own ears if necessary, then resume concentration thereafter. *Clairaudiency* does not function through barriers of lead or gold, but is otherwise unaffected by intervening material.

If the caster has a familiar, his familiar is always considered to be in range for purposes of *clairaudiency*, with only a barrier of gold or lead being able to block him from hearing through its ears.

###### Clairaudiency, Greater

Arcane 6, Divine 6 Type: detection

Range: 500 milesDuration: concentration

This spell enables the caster to hear the sounds in another area through the ears of a selected type of living creatures, such as bats, hawks, or rats. The caster must specify the direction and approximate distance, up to a maximum of 500 miles away, of the first creature he wishes to *clairaudiently* contact. If there is no appropriate creature in that area, the next closest creature of the appropriate type will be contacted instead.

The target does not receive a saving throw and is unaware that it is being used by the caster. If the target moves out of range of the caster, the caster can no longer hear sounds through its ears, but can choose another target in this case. Otherwise, once each turn, the caster can choose another target for the spell, thereby enabling multiple locations to be heard. *Greater**clairaudiency* does not function through barriers of lead or gold, but is otherwise unaffected by intervening material.

The caster must concentrate to use *clairaudiency***,** and he cannot hear sounds through his own ears while doing so. The spell ends when he stops concentrating. This spell is difficult to cast, taking one full turn, and is so draining that it can be used but once per day.

###### Clairvoyancy

Arcane 3 , Divine 3 Type: detection

Range: 90’Duration: 12 turns

This spell enables the caster to see into another area through the eyes of a living creature in that area. Apart from permitting the caster to experience sight rather than sound, it is otherwise identical to *clairaudiency*.

###### Clairvoyancy, Greater

Arcane 6, Divine 6 Type: detection

Range: 500 milesDuration: concentration

This spell enables the caster to see into other areas through the eyes of a selected type of living creatures, such as bats, hawks, or rats. Apart from permitting the caster to experience sight rather than sound, it is otherwise identical to *greater**clairaudiency*.

###### Cloud of Poison

Arcane 4 Type: elemental (air), wall

Range: specialDuration: 6 turns

This spell draws together a *cloud**of**poison*from the foul miasmas of the atmosphere. Because the spell draws its power from natural miasmas, it can only be cast outdoors or in a ventilated room. The *cloud* is 30’ in diameter and spreads out from the caster’s fingertips. Each round thereafter, at the start of the caster’s initiative, the *cloud* moves 20’ away from the caster. The *cloud**of**poison*is heavier than air and will sink down holes or slide downhill; it is broken up by trees or thick vegetation.

Any creature that begins its initiative in or enters the *cloud**of**poison*must make a Death saving throw. If the save fails, the creature dies if it has fewer than 5 Hit Dice, and takes 1 extraordinary poisonous damage if it has 5 HD or more. If the save succeeds, the creature takes 1 extraordinary poisonous damage. (Creatures of 5 HD or more thus always just take 1 extraordinary poisonous damage). The *cloud* persists until **dispelled** by magic, dispersed by strong winds, or 6 turns elapse.

###### Communion

Divine 5 Type: detection, esoteric

Range: 0’Duration: 3 rounds

This spell allows the caster to ask a herald of his deity to answer three yes-or-no questions. The herald might be an angel, demigod, divine hero, or saint of the deity, but is almost never the deity himself (Judge’s discretion). The caster can ask the herald one question per round, and receives the answer immediately thereafter in the form of direct and intuitive knowledge. The herald is wise and well-informed in all matters relating to his deity’s sphere of influence, but is not omniscient. The herald cannot predict the future and his ability to answer questions about current or past events can be confounded by the will of rival gods or heralds. These details are left to the Judge’s discretion. The lengthy prayers required to cast this spell take 1 turn to complete, and can be performed but once per week. Once a year, upon the patron deity’s holiest day, the caster can ask twice the normal number of questions over the course of 6 rounds.

###### Cone of Fear

Arcane 4, Divine 5 Type: enchantment

Range: 0’Duration: 1 turn

This spell produces a 60’ long and 30’ wide cone of fear stretching from the caster’s hands. Each living creature within the cone must make a Paralysis saving throw. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect on that creature. If the save fails, the creature becomes **frightened** for the duration of the spell, or until the effect is **dispelled** normally,or by*remove fear*.

A frightened creature cannot attack, cast spells, or speak (except to scream in stark terror). A frightened creature will run from the source of its fear at its full speed for the duration of the spell. If a frightened creature cannot flee, it will **cower** in terror. An **engaged** creature that is frightened will cower in terror until it is able to disengage with defensive movement. It suffers a -2 penalty to AC and cannot attack, cast spells, move, or take any other actions until the condition ends.

###### Cone of Frost

Arcane 3 Type: blast, elemental (water)

Range: 0’Duration: instantaneous

This spell conjures a cone of freezing water 60’ long and 30’ wide stretching from the caster’s hands. Each creature within the cone must make a Blast saving throw. If the save fails, the creature suffers 1d4 extraordinary cold damage per caster level. If the save succeeds, the creature suffers half that damage.

The*cone of frost* can also damage structures in its area of effect. It deals up to 1d4 extraordinary cold structural damage per caster level to wooden structures and one-fifth that damage to stone structures. (It might deal less if the structure is not entirely in its area of effect.) Any non-magical fires (burning pitch, campfires, torches, etc.) within the cone are automatically extinguished.

###### Cone of Paralysis

Arcane 5 Type: enchantment

Range: 0’Duration: instantaneous

This spell produces a 60’ long and 30’ wide cone of **paralysis** stretching from the caster’s hands. Each creature within the cone must make a Paralysis saving throw. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect on the creature. If the save fails, the creature becomes **paralyzed** for 6 turns.

###### Conflagration

Arcane 6 Type: blast, elemental (fire)

Range: 360’ Duration: instantaneous

This spell conjures a massive conflagration 10’ high and 60’ in diameter. When he casts the spell, the caster designates a target point for the conflagration. Both the caster and the target point must be outdoors. After designating the target point, the caster makes an attack throw against AC 0. If the throw succeeds, the conflagration is centered upon the target point. If the throw fails with an unmodified roll of 1, the conflagration is centered upon the caster. On any other result, the center of the conflagration scatters by 1d3 x 60’ from the target point. The Judge rolls 1d12 to determine the direction of scatter, applied as a clock direction from the target point. Each creature within the conflagration — wherever it ends up — must make a saving throw. If the save fails, the creature suffers 2d6+2 extraordinary fire damage. If the save succeeds, the creature suffers half that damage.

The*conflagration* can also damage structures in its area of effect. It deals up to 2d6+2 x 10 extraordinary fire structural damage to wooden structures and 2d6+2 x 2 extraordinary fire structural damage to stone structures. (It might deal less if the structure is not entirely in its area of effect.) The*conflagration*causes combustibles (such as military oil or petards) to ignite. Because of its huge area of effect, creatures sheltering behind an arrow loop or battlement do not gain the usual protection from a *conflagration*. Creatures sheltering inside an enclosed structure are not damaged unless the interposing structure is destroyed, however.

This spell was created for battlefield use. Its huge area of effect allows it to instantly destroy a company of 120 troops. At battlefield ranges, a conflagration that scatters is usually harmless, sometimes helpful, and occasionally disastrous.

###### Conjure Cacodemon Spawn

Arcane 1 Type: summoning (conjuration)

Range: 360’Duration: 6 turns

This spell opens a portal to the Outer Darkness, allowing the spellcaster to conjure a **cacodemon spawn** with 2 HD and two special abilities (see the ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual*** for details). Only one cacodemon spawn can be conjured by the caster in a given day. The cacodemon spawn will appear at the end of his initiative at a point chosen by the caster within his line of sight and spell range and can begin to act on the caster’s initiative on the following round.

Once the cacodemon appears, it serves the caster for up to one hour (6 turns), provided that the caster maintains concentration on controlling the creature. Spell casting, combat, or movement over half the normal rate results in loss of concentration. The caster, while in control of the cacodemon spawn, can dismiss it to its native sphere at will (doing so at the start of his initiative if in combat). The cacodemon cannot be controlled outside the range of the spell.

If the caster loses concentration, or the cacodemon is somehow forced out of range of the caster, control of the cacodemon is lost and cannot be regained. The creature then seeks to attack the caster and all others in its path. Only *counterspell, dispel magic*, or *dispel evil* can banish the cacodemon once control has been lost. An uncontrolled cacodemon might, of course, choose to return to its home sphere on its own; such creatures will never choose to remain away from their sphere of existence for long.

Cacodemons are highly variable in form and abilities. The first time this spell is cast, the caster should choose the form of the cacodemon spawn conjured, while the Judge should roll or choose its special abilities. The cacodemon spawn should then be assigned a name for later reference. Thereafter, the caster can choose to conjure any named spawn he has previously conjured and safely dispelled, or conjure a new spawn with a different form and special abilities.

EXAMPLE: The first time Ra-Ramses conjures a cacodemon spawn, he selects the monadine form. The Judge determines it has the special abilities of swallow attack and grab and assigns it the name Ixubix the Enveloping Horror. Ra-Ramses uses Ixubix to envelop and dissolve a rival for power in the local temple, then dismisses it. Because he safely dismissed Ixubix, he can conjure it again in the future. The second time Ra-Ramses conjures a spawn, he can conjure either Ixubix or a new spawn. He chooses to conjure Ixubix. Unfortunately, on this casting Ixubix is destroyed in combat. Because Ixubix was destroyed rather than safely dispelled, Ra-Ramses cannot conjure it again.

###### Conjure Dybbuk

Arcane 5 Type: summoning (conjuration)

Range: 360’Duration: 6 turns

This spell opens a portal to the Outer Darkness, allowing the spellcaster to conjure a **dybbuk** with 14 HD and three special abilities (see the ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual*** for details). Only one dybbuk may be conjured by the caster in a given day. Once the dybbuk appears, it serves the caster for up to one hour (6 turns), provided that the caster maintains concentration on controlling the creature. This spell is otherwise identical to *conjure cacodemon spawn*.

###### Conjure Fiend

Arcane 6 Type: summoning (conjuration)

Range: 360’Duration: 6 turns

This spell opens a portal to the Outer Darkness, allowing the spellcaster to conjure a **fiend** with 18 HD and four special abilities (see the ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual*** for details). Only one fiend may be conjured by the caster in a given day. Once the fiend appears, it serves the caster for up to one hour (6 turns), provided that the caster maintains concentration on controlling the creature. This spell is otherwise identical to *conjure cacodemon spawn*.

###### Conjure Genie

Arcane 6 Type: summoning (conjuration), elemental

Range: 360’Duration: 1 day

This spell opens a portal to one of the Elemental Spheres of Air, Earth, Fire, or Water, allowing the spellcaster to conjure a genie from that sphere. (See the ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual*** for details on Djinn, Hafar, Marid and Efreet.) Only one genie of each type can be conjured by the caster in a given day. The genie will appear at the end of his initiative at a point chosen by the caster within his line of sight and spell range and can begin to act on the caster’s initiative on the following round.

Once the genie appears, it serves the caster for up to one day, provided that the caster maintains concentration on controlling the creature. Spell casting, combat, or movement over half the normal rate results in loss of concentration. The caster, while in control of the genie, can dismiss it to its native sphere at will (doing so the start of his initiative if in combat). The genie cannot be controlled outside the range of the spell.

If the caster loses concentration, or the genie is somehow forced out of range of the caster, control of the conjured genie is lost and cannot be regained. The creature then seeks to attack the caster and all others in its path. Only *counterspell*, *dispel magic*,or *dispel evil* can banish the genie once control has been lost. An uncontrolled genie might, of course, choose to return to its home sphere on its own; such creatures will never choose to remain away from their sphere of existence for long. A conjured genie is not under sufficient control to be forced to cast *wish*.

###### Conjure Hellion

Arcane 3 Type: summoning (conjuration)

Range: 360’Duration: 6 turns

A portal to the Outer Darkness is opened, allowing the spellcaster to conjure a **hellion** with 8 HD and two special abilities (see the ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual*** for details). Only one hellion may be conjured by the caster in a given day. Once the hellion appears, it serves the caster for up to one hour (6 turns), provided that the caster maintains concentration on controlling the creature. This spell is otherwise identical to *conjure cacodemon spawn*.

###### Conjure Imp

Arcane 2 Type: summoning (conjuration)

Range: 360’Duration: 6 turns

This spell opens a portal to the Outer Darkness, allowing the spellcaster to conjure an **imp** with 4 HD and two special abilities (see the ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual*** for details). Only one imp may be conjured by the caster in a given day. Once the imp appears, it serves the caster for up to one hour (6 turns), provided that the caster maintains concentration on controlling the creature. This spell is otherwise identical to *conjure cacodemon spawn*.

###### Conjure Incubus

Arcane 4 Type: summoning (conjuration)

Range: 360’Duration: 6 turns

This spell opens a portal to the Outer Darkness, allowing the spellcaster to conjure an **incubus** with 10 HD and three special abilities (see the ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual*** for details). Only one incubus may be conjured by the caster in a given day. Once the incubus appears, it serves the caster for up to one hour (6 turns) provided that the caster maintains concentration on controlling the creature. This spell is otherwise identical to *conjure cacodemon spawn*.

###### Conjure Major Elemental

Arcane 4 Type: elemental (any), summoning (conjuration)

Range: 360’Duration: 6 turns + 1 turn/caster level

This spell opens a portal to one of the Elemental Spheres of Air, Earth, Fire, or Water, allowing the spellcaster to conjure a **12 HD elemental** from that sphere (see the ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual*** for details). Only one major elemental of each type can be conjured by the caster each day. The element will appear at the end of his initiative at a point chosen by the caster within his line of sight and spell range and can begin to act on the caster’s initiative on the following round.

Once the elemental appears, it serves the caster for up to 6 turns + 1 turn per caster level, provided that the caster maintains concentration on controlling it. Spell casting, combat, or movement over half the normal rate results in loss of concentration. The caster, while in control of an elemental, can dismiss it to its native sphere at will (doing so at the start of his Initiative if in combat). The elemental cannot be controlled outside the range of the caster.

If the caster loses concentration, or the elemental is somehow forced out of range of the caster, control of the conjured elemental is lost and cannot be regained. The creature then seeks to attack the caster and all others in its path. Only *counterspell*, *dispel magic*,or *dispel evil* can banish the elemental once control has been lost. An uncontrolled elemental might, of course, choose to return to its home sphere on its own; such creatures will never choose to remain away from their sphere of existence for long.

###### Conjure Petty Elemental

Arcane 2 Type: elemental (any), summoning (conjuration)

Range: 360’Duration: 6 turns + 1 turn/caster level

This spell opens a portal to one of the Elemental Spheres of Air, Earth, Fire, or Water, allowing the spellcaster to conjure a **4 HD elemental** from that sphere (see the ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual*** for details). Only one petty elemental of each type can be conjured by the caster each day. This spell is otherwise identical to *conjure major elemental*.

###### Conjure Supreme Elemental

Arcane 5 Type: elemental (any), summoning (conjuration)

Range: 360’Duration: 6 turns + 1 turn/caster level

This spell opens a portal to one of the Elemental Spheres of Air, Earth, Fire, or Water, allowing the spellcaster to conjure a **16 HD elemental** from that sphere (see the ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual*** for details). Only one supreme elemental of each type can be conjured by the caster each day. This spell is otherwise identical to *conjure major elemental*.

###### Contact Other Sphere

Arcane 5 Type: detection, esoteric

Range: selfDuration: special

This spell sends the caster’s mind to a distant sphere of existence, where he can receive advice and information from one of the great powers that dwells therein, such as an angel, demon, demigod, elemental, or even a true god. When the spell is cast, the caster chooses which sphere he wishes to contact. Each sphere has different types of entities of greater or less availability, reliability, and danger. The spheres are:

*Celestial:* The caster contacts entities on other worlds within his own celestial sphere, separated from his world by vast gulfs of black void. Celestial entities are relatively safe to contact and are relatively responsive and truthful.

*Elemental:* The caster contacts one of the alien beings of raw elemental power that exist in the spheres of air, earth, fire, and water. Elemental beings are generally responsive and very truthful, but their alien thought patterns pose a risk to the caster’s soul.

*Chthonic:* The caster contacts one of the chaotic entities that dwells in the Chthonic Darkness. Chthonic beings are eager to entice the ambitious and powerful and are highly responsive, although not particularly truthful. Because of the long traditions of contact between humanity and these powers, they are relatively safe to contact.

*Empyrean:* The caster contacts one of the lawful entities that dwells in the Empyrean Heaven. Though benevolent, empyrean beings tend to concern themselves with the high patterns of providence and rarely respond to the individual petitions of mortals. Because of the long traditions of contact between humanity and these powers, they are relatively safe to contact.

|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Sphere | Responsive | Truthful | Modifier | Alignment |
| Celestial | 65% | 65% | Death +4 | Caster’s |
| Elemental | 75% | 90% | Death -2 | Neutral |
| Chthonic | 90% | 45% | Death +4 | Chaotic |
| Empyrean | 33% | 99% | Death +4 | Lawful |
| Outer Darkness | 99% | 99% | Death -8 | Chaotic |

*Outer Darkness:* The caster contacts one of the eldritch horrors that dwells in the Outer Darkness between the spheres. The horrors of the Outer Darkness are always watching and waiting to speak with those who dare contact them, and when they speak they offer truth, no matter how terrible it might be. The spiritual risk of contacting the Outer Darkness is incredibly high and only the most foolish and desperate mages attempt it.

While these spheres are based on the Auran Empire campaign setting, the Judge can assign these values to other planes of existence, alternative dimensions, and so on as appropriate to his campaign setting.

The caster may ask one question per two caster levels. He may ask questions at the rate of one per round; each question is answered by the contacted power during the same round. The powers reply in a language the caster understands. Each time a question is asked, the Judge rolls on the adjoining table to see if the power responds to the question and then rolls again to see if the power answers truthfully. The caster can ask the same question repeatedly if desired. The caster must concentrate on maintaining the spell while asking questions, but he does not have to continue asking questions if he has learned what he wishes. Some questions reduce his number of available questions by more than one.

When contacting another sphere, the following types of questions can be asked:

* The command word for a magic item. The magic item must be either in the caster’s possession or be a unique named item.
* The location of a supreme place of power related to the sphere contacted. The caster will learn the direction and approximate distance to the place of power as well as a very short description of that location.
* The location of a very rare or legendary magic item. The caster will learn the direction and approximate distance to the item as well as a very short description of that location.
* The formula for an arcane spell. Asking this question reduces the number of available questions left by the spell’s level.
* The formula for a construct or magic item. Asking this question reduces the number of available questions left by the magic item’s base cost / 20,000gp.
* The true name of a cacodemon he would like to summon. Asking this question reduces the number of available questions left by the cacodemon’s HD / 3.

The Judge can permit other types of questions at his discretion. Immediately after asking each question, the caster must make a Death saving throw, applying the modifier shown on the adjoining table, to see if he suffers spiritual harm from his contact with another sphere. If the save succeeds, the caster’s soul remains intact. If the save fails, the caster must roll on the Tampering with Mortality table for the alignment shown on the table above and suffer whatever side effect results. When rolling on the Tampering with Mortality table, the only modifier that applies is the caster’s WIL modifier. The caster can continue to ask questions even if he suffers a side effect, and can suffer multiple side effects during one series of questions.

###### Control Weather

Arcane 6 Type: elemental (air), esoteric

Range: self Duration: stationary concentration

The caster can conjure and control the weather conditions in an outdoor area of effect around himself with a 720’ radius area of effect. When the spell is cast, the caster chooses one weather condition. The caster can thereafter create or end one additional weather condition on his initiative each round. If a weather condition contradicts or ends an existing condition, the existing condition is ended and replaced. The available weather conditions and their effects are summarized below. The effects of weather caused by *control weather*occur instantly rather than taking an hour or day to occur, but they are otherwise identical to the weather conditions found in Chapter 6, **Weathering the Wild**(p. XX – XX).

If two or more casters *control weather* in partially or completely overlapping areas of effect, the area of effect of the spell is extended to encompass all of the overlapping areas of effect. All the conditions in all areas are applied, with contradictions resolved in favor of the higher caster level(s). Each caster thereafter retains the ability to create or end one weather condition on his initiative. It is not unheard of for powerful high-level spellcasters to struggle to control weather over the course of a battle, alternatively subjecting the troops to scorching heat, freezing cold, and sudden tornadoes.

This spell can be sustained for as long as the caster remains stationary and concentrating.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Condition | Effect |
| Frigid | Expedition speed halved. Creatures without protective clothing or who get wet immediately become hypothermic and lose 1d3 CON per hour and must immediately make a Death saving throw or become frostbitten. Mud freezes instantly. -2 penalty to Seduction rolls. |
| Moderate | Frigid or sweltering conditions ended instantaneously. |
| Sweltering | Expedition speed halved. Creatures in heavy armor must immediately make Death saving throws or become fatigued. Water ration increased by 25% and Dehydration causes double CON loss. Snow melts and mud dries instantly (unlike sweltering weather from natural causes, which takes one day to melt snow or dry mud.) |
| Fair | Foggy, rainy, snowy, stormy, windy, or tornado conditions ended instantaneously. |
| Foggy | Maximum visibility drops to 20’. Speeds of all creatures are halved except for those which do not rely on sight to function. |
| Rainy | All missile attacks suffer a -2 penalty. Mud forms in 1 turn; thereafter, land speeds are halved except on paved roads; wheeled vehicles cannot move at all except on paved roads. |
| Snowy | Maximum visibility drops to 20’. Speeds of all creatures are halved. Snow accumulates in 1 turn; thereafter, land speeds are halved (again) and wheeled vehicles cannot move. |
| Stormy | All missile attacks and listening throws suffer a -4 penalty. Air speed is halved. Expedition speed is halved. All creatures are affected as if by *gale of wind.* In barren or desert terrain, maximum visibility is reduced to 20’ by dust. Vessels at sea might be damaged or drift (see p. XX). |
| Windy | All missile attacks and listening throws suffer a -2 penalty. Air speed is halved. Expedition speed is halved. |
| Tornado | A 100’ tall, 25’ diameter tornado appears at a point of the caster’s choice within the area of effect. The tornado blocks line of sight and missiles and magic cannot pass through it. On his initiative, the caster can move the tornado within the area of effect at a rate of 120’ per round. Any creatures that the tornado moves onto during the caster’s initiative, or that enters the tornado on its own initiative, are attacked as if from a readied 2 HD monster with one attack dealing 1d8 extraordinary slashing damage. After the attack, the creature must make a successful Paralysis saving throw or be knocked **prone** and flung back 5’ from the edge of the tornado. (Creatures of Large size or greater gain a +4 bonus to the saving throw per size category above man-sized.) Before summoning a tornado, a caster must first establish stormy conditions. |

###### Control Winds

Arcane 5, Divine 5 Type: elemental (air), esoteric

Range: 10’/levelDuration: 1 turn/caster level

This spell enables the caster to manipulate the flow of air within range and line of sight. He can control both the direction and speed of wind. Wind speed in ***ACKS II*** is rated as still, gentle, moderate, strong, very strong, and gale. To change wind direction by one point of sail or by one speed category requires the caster to concentrate for one round. The caster does not need to concentrate to maintain the spell, only to change the wind speed or direction.

When used at sea, *control winds*can increase or decrease vessel speed, depending on if the vessel is sailing with or against the wind. The spell can exclusively affect the caster’s vessel, and/or can affect one or more other vessels within range, as the caster chooses. See **Sailing the Seas** in Chapter 12 (p. XX) for details on the effects of wind speed and direction. .

If the caster increases the wind speed to very strong, the local weather conditions become windy (p. XX). All missile attack throws and Listening proficiency throws suffer a -2 penalty. Adventurers in windy conditions have their expedition speed halved. Air speed is halved in any terrain in windy conditions. In barrens or desert terrain only, visibility is reduced to 20’, all speeds are halved, and Land Surveying, Navigation, Searching, and Tracking proficiency throws all suffer -4 penalties due to sandstorms and dust clouds.

If the caster increases the wind speed to gale, the local weather conditions become stormy (p. XX). All missile attack throws and Listening proficiency throws suffer a -4 penalty. The force of the windautomatically extinguishes any candles, torches, or other unprotected flames. It extinguishes protected flames unless the bearer succeeds on a Paralysis saving throw. All characters are affected each round as if by the spell *gale of wind.* In barrens or desert terrain only, visibility is reduced to 20’ and Land Surveying, Navigation, Searching, and Tracking proficiency throws all suffer -4 penalties due to sandstorms and dust clouds.

###### Counterspell

Arcane 1, Divine 1 Type: protection

Range: 180’Duration: instantaneous

This spell enables the caster to extinguish a single ongoing spell or spell-like effect that has been cast on a target creature or object. If *counterspell* is used on a willing creature, or on an object held by a willing creature, the caster can choose which spell or effect to target. If *counterspell*is used on an unwilling creature, or on an object held by an unwilling creature, the creature must make a Spells saving throw. If the save succeeds, the *counterspell*has no effect. If the save fails, one random spell or effect on the creature becomes the target of the spell.

Once the target spell is determined, the caster must make an attack throw versus the spell or spell-like effect, treating it as a creature with an armor class equal to the difference in caster level between the creator of the spell or effect and the caster. If this attack throw succeeds, the spell or effect is extinguished. If this attack throw fails, the *counterspell* has no effect.

Some spells and effects cannot be ended by *counterspell***.** These include spells or effects that are not cast on creatures or objects, **curse** spells or effects, **petrification** spells or effects, and *quest*spells or effects, as well as magic items with effects of permanent duration and diseases caused by spells or effects. *Counterspell* can be used to extinguish spells or effects on a creature or object made permanent by ritual magic only if the caster is of higher level than whoever made the effect permanent.

###### Crafting

Divine 4 Type: transmogrification

Range: touchDuration: indefinite

This spell grants the recipient one additional rank of Art or Craft proficiency for purposes of completing one project (e.g. forging one sword, painting one painting, composing one song). Unproficient characters become apprentices, apprentices become journeymen, journeymen become masters, masters become grand masters, and grand masters become capable of creating magic items at twice the base time and cost of a mage of their class level. The spell expires when the recipient completes the project or when a day passes without the recipient working on the project for at least 8 hours. The recipient must be man-sized or smaller when this spell is cast or it fails to work.

###### Create Chasm

Arcane 3 Type: elemental (earth), wall

Range: 90’Duration: perpetual

This spell causes a 500 square foot area of earth within range to collapse into a 10’ deep chasm. The chasm can be created underfoot of creatures if desired. Each creature in the area of effect must make a Blast saving throw. If the save succeeds, the creature leaps to the nearest safe point. If the save fails, the creature falls into the chasm, suffering 1d6 bludgeoning damage if not otherwise protected (e.g. by flight or levitation). Unattended objects automatically fall into the chasm. *Create**chasm*can only affect volumes of soil, sand, silt, clay, or uncut, unworked rock. The spell does not function on worked stone, wood, cement, concrete, metal, or magical material.

The chasm created by this spell can be re-filled manually. Otherwise the chasm lasts until the spell is dispelled or until the caster dies or decides to stop sustaining it at the start of his turn. When the spell ends, if the chasm has not been filled manually, the earth bubbles upward violently and reforms. Each creature within the chasm must make a Blast saving throw. If the save succeeds, the creature is safely deposited on the surface. If the save fails, the creature suffers 1d6 extraordinary seismic damage from the roiling tremor before being deposited on the surface and knocked **prone**.

###### Create Food

Divine 5 Type: esoteric

Range: 10’Duration: instantaneous

This spell creates 300 lbs of food, enough to feed one platoon of 15 cavalry and mounts or one company of 120 infantry for one day. For each caster level above 9th, the caster is able to create another 300 lbs of food. The created food appears on a flat surface within range and line of sight of the caster. The created food is simple fare of the caster’s choice, highly nourishing but rather bland. The created food decays and becomes inedible within 24 hours, although it can be kept fresh for another 24 hours by casting *purify**food**and**water* on it. This spell can only be cast once per day.

###### Create Water

Divine 4 Type: esoteric

Range: 10’Duration: instantaneous

This spell summons forth an enchanted spring from the ground or wall that will provide 50 gallons of water, enough for one platoon of 15 cavalry and mounts or one company of 120 infantry to stay hydrated for one day. For each caster level above 7th, the caster is able to create another 50 gallons of water. The created water appears anywhere within range and line of sight of the caster. The water created by this spell is just like clean rainwater. Note that one or more vessels to contain the water must be available at the time of casting. Water weighs about 1 stone per gallon; one cubic foot of water is roughly 8 gallons. This spell can only be cast once per day.

###### Cure Blindness\*

Divine 3 Type: healing

Range: touchDuration: instantaneous

This spell cures a living recipient of **blindness** caused by permanent wounds, death magic, and/or reversed healing magic. However, **blindness** caused by a curse cannot be cured by this spell.

The reverse of this spell, *cause blindness,* can instantly blind a living target with milky cataracts. An attack throw is required to touch the target. If the attack throw succeeds, the target is **blinded** until cured.

###### Cure Critical Injury\*

Divine 5 Type: healing

Range: touchDuration: instantaneous

This spell works exactly like *cure light injury*,except that it heals the recipient of 4d6 + caster level damage. The reverse, *cause critical injury*, also works exactly like *cause light injury*, except that it deals 4d6 + caster level extraordinary necrotic damage to the target.

###### Cure Disease\*

Divine 3 Type: healing

Range: touchDuration: instantaneous

This spell cures a living recipient of any and all diseases that it is suffering from, including magical diseases such as lycanthropy and mummy rot as well as fantastical parasites such as slimes. Certain magical diseases might not be countered by this spell or might be countered only by a caster of a certain level or higher. This spell does not prevent reinfection after a new exposure to the same disease.

The reverse of this spell, *cause disease*,can infect a living target with a horrific wasting plague. The target must make a Spells saving throw. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect. If the save fails, the creature is **diseased**. While **diseased**, the creature suffers -2 on attack throws, cannot be magically healed of injuries, and heals at half its normal rate. At the end of each day it is diseased, the creature must make a throw of 2+ or die of the disease. Since sickness comes in many forms, the player or Judge can develop other disease conditions if desired. However, the disease created by this spell is never transmissible.

###### Cure Light Injury\*

Divine 1 Type: healing

Range: touchDuration: instantaneous

This spell can heal a living creature touched by the caster of 1d6+1 damage. The spell can never increase a creature’s hit points beyond their maximum. If the caster so chooses, the spell can cure a **paralyzed** creature of its condition in lieu of healing it of any points of damage.

The reverse form of this spell, *cause light injury*, deals 1d6+1 extraordinary necrotic damage to a living creature touched by the caster. A successful attack throw is required to touch the target.

Undead creatures are affected by this spell and its reverse in opposite fashion; they are injured by *cure light injury* and healed by its reverse.

###### Cure Major Injury\*

Divine 3 Type: healing

Range: touchDuration: instantaneous

This spell works exactly like *cure light injury*,except that it heals the recipient of 2d6 + half caster level damage. The reverse, *cause major injury*, also works exactly like *cause light injury*, except that it deals 2d6 + half caster level extraordinary necrotic damage to the target.

###### Cure Moderate Injury\*

Divine 2 Type: healing

Range: touchDuration: instantaneous

This spell works exactly like *cure light injury*,except that it heals the recipient touched of 2d6 damage. The reverse, *cause moderate injury*, also works exactly like *cause light injury*, except that it deals 2d6 extraordinary necrotic damage to the target.

###### Cure Serious Injury\*

Divine 4 Type: healing

Range: touchDuration: instantaneous

This spell works exactly like *cure light injury*,except that it heals the recipient touched of 2d6 + caster level damage. The reverse, *cause serious injury*, also works exactly like *cause light injury*, except that it deals 2d6 + caster level extraordinary necrotic damage to the target.

###### Curse of the Swine

Arcane 5 , Divine 5 Type: transmogrification

Range: 90’Duration: 1 turn/caster level

This spell can transform one living target per caster level into the form of a boar for the duration of the spell. Each target must make a Spells saving throw. If the save succeeds, the target is not transformed. If the save fails, the target immediately gains the form, physical characteristics, and mental characteristics of boars. However, the transformed target will have the same number of hit points that it previously had in its original form. Otherwise, the transformation is total, including intelligence, behavioral traits, and mentality. Because of the low intelligence of its new form, the target will but dimly remember its former life, and unless persuaded otherwise by, e.g. a character with Beast Friendship or *speak with beasts***,** it will simply engage in swinish behavior for the duration of the spell.

Neither incorporeal nor gaseous creatures can be targeted by this spell, nor can creatures of large size or larger. Creatures with shapechanging abilities such as doppelgangers can revert to their natural forms in one round. Despite its fanciful name, this spell is not actually a curse and can be dispelled by **counterspell** or **dispel magic** like any other spell.

###### Dark Whisper

Arcane 2, Divine 2 Type: death

Range: specialDuration: instantaneous

This spell enables the caster to damage the soul of a living target by whispering terrible words into its ear. A successful attack throw is required to whisper in the creature’s ear unless it is **helpless** or **unconscious**. If the creature is **deaf,** the spell automatically fails. Otherwise, upon hearing the *dark whisper*,the creature must make a Death saving throw. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect. If the save fails, the creature suffers one of the following effects, selected by the caster:

* Plagued by whispers from beyond the grave, the creature suffers a -2 to Listening throws and -2 to surprise rolls.
* Disturbed by truths it cannot unhear, the creature mutters to itself constantly. It cannot sneak or surprise opponents, and its spellcasting initiative rolls are at -1.
* Nightmares wrack the creature. Each time it attempts to rest, it must roll 1d6. On a 1, it tosses and turns all night, cannot recover spells, and does not heal.
* The creature attempts to drown its horror in consumption. It suffers a cumulative -1 penalty to all saving throws every hour until it consumes something (smoke, alcohol, etc.)

With the Judge’s permission, the caster might also invent his own whisper, but it should be no more powerful than those described above. There is no limit to the number of different *whispers*a creature can suffer from. The effects of a *dark whisper*cannot be **dispelled**, but can be removed with a *dispel evil* or *remove curse*spell.

###### Deathless Minion

Arcane 2 , Divine 2 Type: necromancy

Range: 45’Duration: 1 hour

This spell raises the bones or body of a dead target as an undead skeleton or zombie that follows the caster’s spoken commands. An animated skeleton can be created only from a mostly intact skeleton; a zombie can be created only from a mostly intact corpse. Animated skeletons have Hit Dice equal to the Baseline Hit Dice such monsters have in life; for skeletons of humans or demi-humans, this means one Hit Die, regardless of the character level of the deceased. Zombies have one more Hit Die than monsters’ Baseline HD but half the speed.

The caster can give verbal orders to his *deathless minion* when he first animates it and thereafter anytime it is in line of sight on his initiative. Complex or extensive orders require the caster to expend an action in lieu of moving, but simple orders (“protect me!”) do not require an action. Orders can be given in any language the caster speaks. The *deathless minion* will mindlessly obey whatever orders it is given to the best of its (limited) ability. It cannot accomplish tasks that require abstract thought or higher reasoning. If it completes all of its orders, or for whatever reason is physically unable to obey its orders, the *deathless minion* will simply remain stationary until it receives new orders. The*deathless minion* acts on its own initiative each round.

Unlike *animate undead*, the HD of the skeleton or zombie created are not limited by caster level. However, a *deathless minion*lasts for just one hour, after which it crumbles to dust.

###### Death Ward

Divine 4 Type: protection

Range: touchDuration: 2 turns

This spell grants the recipient immunity to any **curse** and **death** spells or effects that target him. The curse effects blocked by this spell include is includes Death spells such as *dismember* or *disintegration*, reversed Healing type such as *extinguish life* or *bestow curse,* and monstrous death effects such as petrifying gaze or enervating touch. However, it does not include other harmful effects that force Death saves, such as poison.

###### Deflect Ordinary Missiles

Arcane 3 , Divine 3 Type: protection

Range: touchDuration: 6 turns

This spell deflects missile attacks dealing mundane damage which are directed at its recipient. Missile attacks include, e.g., arrows, boulders, bolts, bullets, and thrown objects. The deflected missile attacks automatically miss the recipient. If the deflected attack has an area of effect, roll for scatter to determine the direction and distance deflected. The recipient can still be harmed if it ends up in the area of effect after deflection. Attacks made with silver weapons are considered to deal extraordinary damage for purposes of this spell.

###### Deflect Ordinary Weapons

Arcane 5, Divine 5 Type: protection

Range: touchDuration: 3 turns

This spell deflects missile or melee attacks dealing mundane damage which are directed at its recipient. The deflected attacks automatically miss the recipient. If the deflected attack has an area of effect, roll for scatter to determine the direction and distance deflected. The recipient can still be harmed if it ends up in the area of effect after deflection. Attacks made with silver weapons are considered to deal extraordinary damage for purposes of this spell.

###### Delay Death

Divine 5 Type: esoteric, healing

Range: touchDuration: special

This spell extends the time period available to prevent a critically wounded, grievously wounded, or mortally wounded living recipient from dying. A critically wounded creature normally will die unless healed to 1 hp within one day; if *delay death* is cast on the creature, the time is extended to one week. A grievously wounded creature normally will die unless healed to 1 hp within one turn; with *delay**death*, the time is extended to one day. A mortally wounded creature normally will die unless healed to 1 hp within one round; with *delay**death*, the time is extended to one hour. *Delay**death*cannot aid a creature which has been instantly killed, nor does it heal permanent wounds suffered. If cast on a healthy creature (with 1 hp or more), *delay**death*has no effect at all; it cannot “prevent” death.

###### Delay Disease

Divine 1 Type: esoteric, healing

Range: touchDuration: 24 hours

This spell temporarily staves off the ravages of one or more diseases afflicting a living recipient. It will affect acute illnesses such as flu; chronic diseases such as consumption or leprosy; the infection caused by giant rats; the necrosis caused by sage slime and murder maggots; the lycanthropy caused by werecreatures; and even the rotting disease caused by a dragon’s fetid breath.

The spell will temporarily halt the incubation of a disease that has not yet become symptomatic, and ameliorate the symptoms of an existing disease, but it will not reverse any damage already caused by the disease. For example, it would allow a character bedridden by a giant rat’s infection to move and fight normally, and would prevent further loss of attributes to a dragon’s fetid breath for a day, but it would not undo attribute loss already suffered, or restore a finger destroyed by leprosy. Unless the disease is cured, its progress will resume as soon as the spell’s duration ends.

If the spell is cast on a recipient who is unafflicted with any disease(s), it has a prophylactic effect. Should the recipient become afflicted with any disease, the disease’s onset will be delayed until the duration expires.

###### Delay Poison

Divine 2 Type: esoteric, healing

Range: touch Duration: 1 turn/caster level

This spell temporarily staves off the effects of poison in the recipient. Any poison in the recipient’s system or any poison to which it is exposed during the spell’s duration does not affect the recipient until the spell’s duration has expired. Unless cured, saving throws and damage as appropriate are rolled once the spell ends. *Delay poison* does not cure any damage that poison has already done. However, if the spell is cast on a subject who died from poison within the last turn, the target character is restored until the spell duration ends. A revived character will have 1 hp for the duration of the spell, but if the spell ends prior to the poison being cured, the recipient dies again.

###### Desiccate

Arcane 1 Type: blast, elemental (water)

Range: 60’Duration: instantaneous

This spell creates a 5’ diameter sphere of dehydration centered on a target point. Each living creature in the area of effect must make a Blast saving throw. If the save fails, the creature becomes **dehydrated** and suffers 1d12 extraordinary poisonous damage as water departs its body while toxins remain behind. If the save succeeds, the creature suffers half that damage but is not dehydrated.

###### Destroy Dead

Divine 1 Type: death

Range: 225’Duration: instantaneous

This spell can target the bones or body of either an unanimated skeleton or cadaver or an undead skeleton or zombie of less than 9 HD. If the spell targets an unanimated skeleton or cadaver, the skeleton or cadaver automatically crumbles to dust without a saving throw. If the spell targets an undead skeleton or zombie, the target must make a Death saving throw. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect. If the save fails, the target immediately crumbles to dust. The spell has no effect on living creatures or on undead other than skeletons and zombies.

###### Discern Bewitchment\*

Divine 2 Type: detection

Range: 45’Duration: 3 turns (24 hours)

This spell allows the caster to discern whether creatures within range and line of sight are affected by one or more **bewitchments**.If so, the castersees a rosy pink glowemanating from the creature.For purpose of this spell,bewitchmentsinclude **bewitchment**, **domination, enslavement**, and **forgetfulness** effects, as well as the charms of creatures such as harpies or vampires.

The reverse of this spell, *indiscernible bewitchment*, completely masks any and all **bewitchments** on a creature for a period of 24 hours.

###### Discern Curse\*

Divine 3 Type: detection

Range: 45’Duration: 3 turns (24 hours)

This spell allows the caster to discern whether areas, creatures, and objects within range and line of sight are cursed. If so, the caster sees a vivid purpureus glow emanating from the area, creature, or object. The spell does not reveal the nature of the **curse** or how it is triggered, only that an item or area is **cursed**.

The reverse of this spell, *indiscernible curse*, completely masks any and all **curses** on an area (up to 20’ feet on a side), creature, or object, for a period of 24 hours.

###### Discern Evil\*

Divine 1 Type: detection

Range: 45’Duration: 3 turns

This spell allows the caster to discern whether areas, creatures, and objects within range and line of sight are evil. If so, the caster sees a sinister crimson glow emanating from the area, creature, or object. Only the caster sees the glow. Areas are considered evil if they are sinkholes of evil. Creatures are considered evil if they are enchanted creatures (e.g. summoned monsters or undead) of Chaotic alignment or if they have evil intentions towards the caster. Normal characters, even if Chaotic, are not detected by this spell unless they have actively evil intentions against the caster. Objects are considered evil if they are enchanted with or can be used to cast death spells, reversed healing spells, and/or necromancy spells, excluding death spells that exclusively target undead. Other objects might qualify as evil, too (Judge’s discretion). Poisons, physical traps, and natural animals are neither good nor evil, so they are not discerned.

Reversed, this spell becomes *discern good*(sometimes called “discern victim” by its users). The caster sees a bright cobalt glow emanating from the area, creature, or object. Areas are considered good if they are pinnacles of good. Creatures are considered good if they are enchanted creatures of Lawful alignment or if they have good intentions towards the caster. Objects are considered good if they are **blessed** or if they are enchanted with or can be used to cast Lawful divine magic. Certain other objects might also qualify as good (Judge’s discretion).

###### Discern Gist

Arcane 1, Divine 1 Type: detection

Range: 0’ Duration: 2 turns

This spell grants the caster the ability to discern the general meaning of any written script he touches, including ciphers, secret symbols, and other codes. The caster does not receive a detailed and exacting translation of the script, just the central idea or essence of it. For instance, a caster could use this spell to discern that the Kemeshi hieroglyphs on a tomb wall warn of the presence of a powerful mummy lord within, or to discern that a spell scroll written in Kemeshi carries the formula for *unliving puppet*spell, but he could not use the scroll or record the spell in his spellbook without actually learning Kemeshi.

###### Discern Invisible

Arcane 2, Divine 3 Type: detection

Range: 90’Duration: 6 turns

This spell allows the caster to discern invisible creatures or objects within range and line of sight, seeing them as translucent shapes. Only the caster sees the shapes. Characters or creatures who are simply hiding (even if their ability to hide is augmented by magic such as *chameleon*) are not discerned.

###### Discern Magic

Arcane 1, Divine 1 Type: detection

Range: 90’Duration: 2 turns

This spell allows the caster to discern whether areas, creatures, and objects within range and line of sight are imbued with or affected by one or more magical effects. If so, the caster sees a pale glowing yellow light emanating from the area, creature, or object. Only the caster sees the glow. Areas, creatures, or objects imbued with or affected by **bewitchments** (including **control** and **domination** effects), **curses,** or **invisibility** cannot be discerned, however; those require more powerful detection spells.

###### Discern Poison

Divine 1 Type: detection

Range: 90’Duration: 2 turns

This spell allows the caster to discern whether areas, creatures, and objects within range and line of sight are poisonous to him. If so, the caster sees a sickly green glow emanating from the area, creature, or object. Only the caster sees the glow. Note that this spell will not detect poisons to which the caster is immune.

###### Disfigure Body and Soul

Arcane 6 Type: death

Range: 45’Duration: instantaneous

The spell can disfigure the body and soul of a living target. The target must make a Death saving throw. If the save fails, the target must immediately roll on the Savage Mortal Woundstable and the Tampering with Mortality tables for his alignment, and suffer the results listed under Permanent Wounds Suffered and Side Effects Suffered. If the save succeeds, the target must immediately roll on the Mortal Wounds table, but does not have to roll on the Tampering with Mortality table.

When rolling on the Mortal Wound table due to *disfigure**body**and soul*, the only modifiers that apply are those from CON and HD. When rolling on the Tampering with Mortality table due to *disfigure body and soul*, the only modifier that applies is the target’s WIL modifier. The target does not suffer from the results listed in the Condition & Recovery column of either table. Any permanent wounds suffered are instantly cauterized, healed, scarred over, etc.

*Disfigure body and soul*was created by the dread sorcerer-kings of old Zahar to permanently maim the spirit and flesh of those who offended them. What makes this spell truly horrible is that its effects can only be undone by a creature of higher caster level than the caster who disfigured the body and soul. If this spell is cast by a 14th level mage with Black Lore of Zahar proficiency, it is virtually impossible to undo, even with *wish*or *miracle*.

###### Dismember

Arcane 3 , Divine 4 Type: death

Range: 90’Duration: instantaneous

The spell can maim and dismember a living target. The target must make a Death saving throw. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect. If the save fails, the target suffers 3d6 extraordinary necrotic damage and must immediately roll on the Savage Mortal Woundstable and suffer the result listed under Permanent Wounds Suffered. When rolling on the Mortal Wound table due to *dismember*, the only modifiers that apply are those from CON and HD. The target does not suffer from the results listed in the Condition & Recovery column of the table. Any permanent wounds suffered are instantly cauterized, healed, scarred over, etc.

EXAMPLE: Marcus (a fighter with CON 18) is the target of a *dismember*cast by his foe, the sorcerer-king Sebek. Marcus fails his save versus Death, so he takes 3d6 extraordinary necrotic damage and must roll on the Mortal Wounds table. Consulting the Mortal Wounds table, Marcus sees he must roll 1d20 and 1d6. Marcus’s 1d20 roll is a 3, modified by +3 for his CON 18 and +4 for his d8 HD. Marcus cross-indexes a modified d20 roll of 10 against a d6 roll of 3 on the table and finds that one of his arms has been severed!

###### Disintegration

Arcane 6 Type: death

Range: 90’Duration: instantaneous

This spell targets a single creature or object (up to a 10’ x 10’ x 10’ cube of material) with a bolt of annihilating energy that springs from the caster’s pointing finger. (The exact appearance of the bolt can vary based on the caster’s spell signature.)

If the spell targets a creature, the creature must make a Death saving throw. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect. If the save fails, the creature is slain and its remains reduced to a small pile of dust. Any objects carried or worn by the creature are not affected. (The spell could be used to **disintegrate** a creature’s armor or clothing by a caster willing to use death magic to induce nudity, but the casting would not disintegrate the creature.)

If the spell targets an object, the object must make a Death saving throw. If the target object is carried or worn by a creature, use the creature’s saving throw. If the target object is occupied by one or more creatures, use whichever creature’s saving throws are most likely to succeed. If the target object is not carried, worn, or occupied, use the saving throws of 0th level fighters. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect. If the save fails, the object is reduced to nothing but a small pile of dust. If the object was occupied, the occupants fall to the ground, are knocked **prone**, and suffer 1d6 bludgeoning damage per 10’ fallen. If the object was occupied and moving, the occupants are flung 10’ in the direction of movement per 60’ of speed, and suffer 1d6 bludgeoning damage per 10’ moved.

EXAMPLE: Andravus, Castinus, Hyglak, and Raemon are traveling at a speed of 90’ in a heavy chariot in hot pursuit of a powerful warlock. The warlock casts *disintegration* on the chariot. The chariot must make a Death saving throw. Because the chariot is occupied, the saving throw will be made by whichever of the four has the best chance of succeeding. Consulting their character sheets, the players see that Andravus succeeds on 10+, Castinus on 10+, Hyglak on 11+, and Raemon at 7+. Raemon makes the throw, but unfortunately he rolls a 2. The chariot is disintegrated, and all of the adventurers are flung 15’, suffer 1d6 bludgeoning damage, and get knocked prone.

###### Dispel Evil\*

Divine 6 Type: esoteric, protection

Range: 45’Duration: special

This powerful spell can be cast in several different ways, depending on the nature of the evil to be **dispelled:**

* Centered on the caster to create a sacred circle of protection around him. For as long as the caster remains stationary and concentrating, to a maximum of 1 turn, any enchanted creature of Chaotic alignment that starts its initiative in or moves within 45’ of him must make a Death saving throw. If the throw fails, the creature is destroyed. If the throw succeeds, the creature is **frightened** until the end of its next initiative.
* Cast on an evil altar or the center of a place of death within 45’ in order to instantaneously cleanse any sinkholes of evil that have formed there. The Judge will resolve this based on the degree and extent of the evil.
* Cast on a target enchanted creature of Chaotic alignment within 45’ to instantaneously destroy it. The creature must immediately make a Death saving throw with a -2 penalty. If the throw fails, the creature is destroyed. If the throw succeeds, the creature is **frightened** until the end of its next initiative.
* Cast on a target enchanted creature from an elemental sphere of existence within 45’ to banish it. The creature must immediately make a Death saving throw. If the throw fails, the creature is banished back to its sphere. If the throw succeeds, the creature is not affected.
* Cast on a target creature within 45’ who is under the effects of a *necromantic potence*,*spiritwalk*, *soul**eating*, or *soul**swap* to instantaneously dispel the effect(s).
* Cast on a target creature within 45’ in order to instantaneously remove a powerful **curse** that is affecting the creature.

The reverse of this spell, *dispel**good*, is identical in all respects except that it functions against enchanted creatures of Lawful alignment and destroys good altars.

###### Dispel Magic

Arcane 3, Divine 3 Type: protection

Range: 180’Duration: special

This spell can extinguish ongoing spells that have been cast on a creature or object, or extinguish ongoing spells within a cubic area 20’ on a side. The caster must choose whether to cast *dispel**magic* on a creature or object, or to affect an area. If *dispel**magic* is targeted at a creature, all spells and spell-like effects (including ongoing potion effects) might be canceled. If cast upon an area, all such effects within the area might be canceled.

After the caster chooses the spell’s target, he must make an attack throw versus each spell or spell-like effect he might extinguish. Each spell or spell-like effect is considered to have an armor class equal to the difference in caster level between the creator of the spell or effect and the caster. If an attack throw succeeds, that particular spell or spell-like effect is extinguished. If an attack throw fails, the spell or effect continues.

Süreus is a 5th level mage with an attack throw of 9+. If he attempts to dispel an effect cast by a 1st level caster, the effect is treated as AC (1-5) = -4, so he succeeds on 5+. If he attempts to dispel an effect by a 10th level caster, the effect is treated as AC (10-5) = 5, so he succeeds on 14+.

Some spells and effects cannot be ended by *dispel**magic***.** These include *curse*spells or effects, *petrification*spells or effects, and *quest*spells or effects, as well as magic items with effects of permanent duration and diseases caused by spells or effects. *Dispel* *magic* can be used to extinguish spells or effects made permanent by ritual magic, but only if the caster is of higher level than whoever made the effect permanent.

###### Divination

Divine 4 Type: detection, esoteric

Range: selfDuration: special

This spell can provide the caster with a useful piece of advice in reply to a question concerning a specific goal, event, or activity that is to occur within one week. The advice can be as simple as a short phrase, or it might take the form of a cryptic rhyme or omen.

Divinations are not always accurate, however. When the spell is cast, the Judge secretly makes a magic research throw on behalf of the caster. A natural roll of at least 9 always succeeds. If the throw succeeds, the advice is good. If the throw fails, the advice is wrong and harmful.

The *divination* can see into the future only one week, so anything that might happen after that does not affect the result. In addition, if the caster doesn’t immediately act on the advice, the conditions may change so that the advice is no longer useful (Judge’s discretion).

###### Divine Armor

Divine 2 Type: protection

Range: selfDuration: 6 turns

This spell protects the caster with invisible armor of magical force. It guarantees the caster an Armor Class of 7 against melee and missile attacks of all sorts. The *divine armor* stacks with modifiers to AC from DEX but not with modifiers to AC from armor, class powers, conditions, magic, or proficiencies. Conditions which improve an opponent’s attack throw against the creatures they affect (e.g., **flanked** or **vulnerable**) are not affected by *divine armor*. Unlike *arcane armor*, it does not protect against *mage missile*.

###### Divine Grace

Divine 2 Type: protection

Range: touchDuration: 12 turns

This spell grants the recipient a bonus of +2 to all saving throws. The *divine**grace* ends immediately if the recipient acts in ways contrary to the divine caster’s alignment or deity.

###### Divine Protection

Divine 3 Type: protection

Range: touchDuration: 9 turns

This spell protects the recipient with wards and charms of protection and safety. For the duration of the spell, the recipient receives a +2 bonus to AC and +2 bonus to all saving throws. The bonus to AC stacks with both worn armor and any other enhancements to AC.

###### Dominate Beasts

Divine 2 Type: enchantment

Range: 45’Duration: concentration

This spell grants the caster the ability to dominate 1d4 living animal targets. Each target must make a Spells saving throw. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect. If the save fails, the target is **dominated**.

Dominated animals act according to the caster’s will, doing whatever is mentally commanded of them, including fight, flee, growl, fetch etc. However, they have no independent volition and if left without commands simply sit idle. All of the dominated animals act on the caster’s initiative, in any order he chooses.

The spell lasts while the caster maintains concentration, until the target is somehow forced out of range of the caster, or until it is dispelled. The spell can be **dispelled** normally, and can be detected with *discern bewitchment*, but cannot be detected with *discern**magic*. Once the spell ends, the affected animals will be hostile to the caster.

###### Dominate Humanoid

Arcane 2 Type: enchantment

Range: 45’Duration: concentration

This spell grants the caster the ability to dominate a living humanoid target. The target must make a Spells saving throw. If the throw succeeds, the spell has no effect on the creature. If the throw fails, the humanoid is **dominated**.

A dominated humanoid acts according to the caster’s will, doing whatever is mentally commanded of him, including flight, flee, talk, etc. However, it has no independent volition and if left without commands simply stands around aimlessly. It cannot cast spells or use magic items but can use special abilities. The dominated humanoid acts on the caster’s initiative.

The spell lasts while the caster maintains concentration, until the target is somehow forced out of range of the caster, or until it is dispelled. The spell can be dispelled normally, and can be detected with *discern**bewitchment*, but cannot be detected with *discern**magic*. Once the spell ends, the affected humanoids will be hostile to the caster, unless the caster is a priestess of Nasga (described in ***Axioms 11***).

###### Dominate Monster

Arcane 3 , Divine 5 Type: enchantment

Range: 90’Duration: concentration

This spell grants the caster the ability to dominate a living target. The target must make a Spells saving throw. If the throw succeeds, the spell has no effect on that creature. If the throw fails, the creature is **dominated**.

A dominated creature acts according to the caster’s will, doing whatever is mentally commanded of him, including flight, flee, talk, etc. However, it has no independent volition and if left without commands simply stands around aimlessly. It cannot cast spells or use magic items but can use special abilities. The dominated creature acts on the caster’s initiative.

The spell lasts while the caster maintains concentration, until the target is somehow forced out of range of the caster, or until it is dispelled. The spell can be dispelled normally, and can be detected with *discern**bewitchment*, but cannot be detected with *discern**magic*. Once the spell ends, the affected creatures will be hostile to the caster, unless the caster is a priestess of Nasga (described in ***Axioms 11***) and they could potentially be attracted to her.

###### Dominate Plants

Arcane 5 Type: enchantment

Range: 0’Duration: concentration

This spell grants the caster the ability to dominate one or more living plant targets within a 60’ radius of him. Each target, other than ordinary plants, must make a Spells saving throw. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect. If the save fails, or the target is an ordinary plant, the target is **dominated**.

All of the dominated plants act on the caster’s initiative, in any order he chooses. Dominated plants act according to the caster’s will, doing whatever is mentally commanded of them. Since ordinary plants are not normally mobile, the spell grants them the ability to move their branches, leaves, limbs, and vines, though not to uproot themselves.

Assuming the caster commands the plants to hinder non-plant creatures in the area of effect, each non-plant creature that enters, or starts its initiative in, the area must make a Paralysis saving throw. If the save succeeds, the creature avoids being hindered by the plants. If the save fails, the creature is **restrained** until the start of the caster’s initiative. If the save fails on an unmodified 1, the creature is knocked **prone** and **restrained** until it escapes. At the end of each initiative thereafter until it escapes, the creature suffers 1d4 piercing damage and 1d4 toxic damage from nettles, thorns, poison ivy, and the like. The dominated plants have no independent volition and if left without commands simply vegetate.

The spell lasts while the caster maintains concentration or until it is dispelled. The spell can be **dispelled** normally, and can be detected with *discern**bewitchment*, but cannot be detected with *discern**magic*. Once the spell ends, the affected plants will be hostile to the caster (though non-motile ordinary varieties may have difficulty acting on it).

###### Earth’s Excrescence

Arcane 1 Type: blast, elemental (earth)

Range: 90’Duration: instantaneous

This spell causes an area of earth 15’ in diameter centered on a target point to burst like a swollen boil, casting forth chunks of stone, dirt, and hot mud. Each creature within the area of effect must make a Blast saving throw. If the save fails, the creature suffers 1d6 extraordinary seismic damage per caster level (3d6 maximum) and is knocked down. If the save succeeds, the creature suffers half that damage and retains its footing. Creatures of Huge size or greater cannot be knocked down by this spell, but can still suffer damage.

Structures within the area of effect can also be damaged by the *excrescence*. The spell deals up to 1d6 extraordinary seismic structural damage per caster level to wooden structures (max 3d6) and one-fifth that damage to stone structures. (It might deal less if the structure is not entirely in its area of effect.) However, the *earth’s excrescence* can only be brought forth from an area of soil, sand, silt, clay, or uncut, unworked rock. The spell does not function on worked stone, wood, cement, concrete, metal, or magical materials.

###### Earth’s Mire

Arcane 5 Type: elemental (earth), transmogrification

Range: 180’Duration: 3d6 days (perpetual)

This spell changes a volume of natural, uncut, unworked rock into an equal volume of mud. The volume transformed can be up to 3,000 square feet at the surface and up to 10’ deep. Magical stone is not affected by the spell, nor are building, bridges, and other structures made of worked stone.

*Earth’s mire* is most commonly cast in preparation for a pitched battle to create fields of nearly impassable ground. Creatures entering the area of the mud become mired in the deep morass. Mired creatures are slowed to 1/10th their normal movement speed and suffer a -2 penalty to AC.

If the spell is cast underground on a cave’s rock ceiling, the mud immediately falls to the floor and spreads out in a pool, forming a mire (as above). When this occurs, any creature in the affected area must make a Blast saving throw. On a failed save, the creature suffers 8d6 bludgeoning damage. If the save succeeds, the creature suffers half that damage. At the Judge’s discretion, transforming a large volume of ceiling rock in a cave can precipitate a wider cave-in as the area’s structural integrity becomes compromised.

Mud created by this spell remains such until the duration expires or the reverse of this spell (*earth’s**hardening*)restores the rock to its original substance. The volume transformed by the reversed version is identical, but the transmutation is perpetual. When mud becomes rock, the shape of the area may be different, as the mud may have moved or shifted.

###### Earth’s Movement

Arcane 6 Type: elemental (earth), esoteric, movement

Range: 360’Duration: 6 turns

This spell allows the caster to move large volumes, even to the point of altering the surface features of areas within range. By concentrating for one turn, the caster can move a volume of earth (up to 3,000 square feet at the surface and up to 10’ deep) by 60’ towards a point in range. The spell’s range extends upwards into the sky and downwards through the earth until it reaches the limit (360’) or solid rock, and can thus be used to dig pits of up to 240’ depth or build ramparts up to 240’ high. *Earth’s**movement*cannot move stone, only soil.

###### Earth’s Teeth

Arcane 3 Type: blast, elemental (earth)

Range: 180’Duration: instantaneous

This spell can impale one target creature per level of the caster with a pillar of jagged rock that erupts from the earth. All of the targets must be within a single 30’ diameter sphere. The caster can choose which creatures in the area of effect are targeted. The caster must make an attack throw against each target. On a successful attack, the target suffers 5d6 piercing damage. On a failed attack, the target narrowly dodges the impaling pillar. The pillars immediately crumble to dust after the attack.

EXAMPLE: A party of adventurers is set upon by a band of 8 ogres. A fierce melee ensues, into which Quintus, a 6th level mage, casts *earth’s teeth*. Quintus can target 6 creatures, so he selects 6 of the ogres. Quintus must make an attack throw against each ogre (AC 4), As a 6th level mage, Quintus has an attack throw of 9+, so he will need to roll 13 or more to impale each ogre. He will deal 5d6 piercing damage to each ogre he successfully impales.

###### Earth’s Tremor

Arcane 4 Type: blast, elemental (earth)

Range: 0’Duration: concentration

This spell causes the earth near the caster to begin to spasm and shake violently. The caster can choose to have the *tremor*radiate outward from him along the ground in all directions to a 50’ radius, or blast outward along the ground in a flat cone 150’ long and 100’ wide. Each round of the duration, each creature that starts its initiative in or enters the affected area must make a Blast saving throw. Creatures gain a +4 bonus to the saving throw per size category larger than man-sized. If the save fails, the creature suffers 1d6 extraordinary seismic damage and is knocked **prone**. If the save succeeds, the creature suffers no damage and retains its footing. Structures in the area of effect suffer 1 extraordinary seismic structural damage per round per 10’ square area. For example, a 100’ long, 10’ wide in the area of effect would take 100 shp damage per round.

An *earth’s**tremor*can only be brought forth if the caster is standing on soil, sand, silt, clay, or uncut, unworked rock and it is halted by deep water (5’ or more). An *earth’s**tremor* ends when the caster halts or loses concentration.

###### Earth’s Wave

Arcane 2 Type: blast, elemental (earth)

Range: 0’Duration: 1 round

This spell causes the earth to swell into a heaving wave 5’ wide and tall that travels 120’ away from the caster along the ground in any desired direction. Any creature that begins its initiative in, or enters, the wave’s path must make a Blast saving throw. Creatures gain a +4 bonus to the saving throw per size category larger than man-sized. If the save fails, the creature suffers 2d6 extraordinary seismic damage and is knocked **prone**. If the save succeeds, the creature suffers half that damage but retains its footing.

A *wave of earth* can only be brought forth along an area of soil, sand, silt, clay, or uncut, unworked rock. A *wave* cannot be conjured on an area of worked stone, wood, cement, concrete, metal, or water deeper than 5’, and if it encounters such an area, it immediately comes to a halt.

###### Energy Invulnerability

Arcane 4, Divine 4 Type: elemental (any), protection

Range: touchDuration: 1 turn

This spell grants the recipient invulnerability against one type of energy for the duration of the spell. The caster designates the type when the spell is cast, choosing from cold, electric, fire, luminous, necrotic, or seismic. The recipient becomes **immune** to both mundane and extraordinary damage of that type. It automatically succeeds on saving throws against spells or special abilities that deal the chosen damage type, and ignores mundane and extraordinary damage of the chosen damage type.

###### Energy Protection

Arcane 2, Divine 2 Type: elemental (any), protection

Range: touchDuration: 6 turns

This spell grants the recipient protection against one type of energy for the duration of the spell. The caster designates the type when the spell is cast, choosing from cold, electric, fire, luminous, necrotic, or seismic. The recipient becomes **immune** to mundane damage of the chosen type and automatically succeeds on saving throws against spells or effects that deal mundane damage of the chosen type. It becomes **resistant** to extraordinary damage of the chosen type. The recipient reduces the extraordinary damage dealt by the chosen type by half and gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against spells or special abilities that deal extraordinary damage of the chosen type.

###### Enslave Humanoid

Arcane 6 Type: enchantment

Range: 45’Duration: perpetual

This spell can totally **enslave** a living humanoid target to the caster’s will. If the target has fewer than 2 HD, it is automatically **enslaved.** If the target has 2 HD or more, it must make a Spells saving throw. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect. If the save fails, the target is **enslaved** until the effect is dispelled.

When the caster is present, the **enslaved** creature will respond to the caster’s orders and do whatever is commanded of it. If the caster and the **enslaved** creature cannot communicate due to a language barrier or some other situation, the **enslaved** creature will act in the interest of the caster to serve and protect it as best it can. Even if the caster attacks the **enslaved** creature or its friends, it will not defend itself or take arms against the caster.

When the caster is not present, the **enslaved** creature will be confused and passive. It will be capable of carrying out routine activities, but cannot use spells or magic items or make complex decisions. Characters familiar with the **enslaved** creature before its enslavement will be able to tell that something is amiss, although they may not know it is **enslaved** unless they *discern bewitchment*. *Enslave**humanoid*counts as a bewitchment for purposes of *discern**magic*and *discern**bewitchment*.

###### Faithful Companion

Arcane 1, Divine 1 Type: necromancy

Range: touchDuration: 1 hour per caster level

This spell raises the bones or body of a dead canine target as an undead skeleton or zombie under the caster’s mental control. An animated canine skeleton can be created only from a mostly intact skeleton; a canine zombie can be created only from a mostly intact canine corpse. For purposes of this spell, canines include coyotes, dogs, foxes, jackals, and wolves, but not wargs, hellhounds or other monstrosities. Canine skeletons will have Hit Dice equal to the number the canine had in life. Canine zombies will have one more Hit Die than the monster had in life, but one-half the speed.

The caster can give verbal orders to his *faithful**companion* when he first animates it and thereafter anytime it is in line of sight on his initiative. Complex or extensive orders require the caster to expend action in lieu of moving, but simple orders (“protect me!”) do not require an action. Orders can be given in any language the caster speaks. The *faithful**companion* will mindlessly obey whatever orders it is given to the best of its (limited) ability. It cannot accomplish tasks that require abstract thought or higher reasoning. If it completes all of its orders, or for whatever reason is physically unable to obey its orders, the *faithful**companion* will simply remain stationary until it receives new orders. The*faithful**companion* acts on its own initiative each round.

A *faithful**companion*remains animated until destroyed or **dispelled**, or until one hour per caster level elapses. If the *faithful companion* remains intact when the spell ends (e.g. it wasn’t destroyed), the canine’s remains can be re-animated with full hp by another casting of this spell. (Not even death can break the bond between a necromancer and a beloved dog!) However, if the *faithful companion* was destroyed, it crumbles to dust.

###### Fan of Flames

Arcane 1 Type: blast, elemental (fire)

Range: 0’Duration: instantaneous

This spell hurls bolts of searing flame in a fan 40’ long and 20’ wide stretching from the caster’s hands. Each creature of the caster’s choice within the fan must make a Blast saving throw. If the save fails, the creature suffers 1d8 extraordinary fire damage. If the save succeeds, the creature suffers half that damage.

The*fan**of**flames* can also damage structures in its area of effect. It deals 1d8 / 3 extraordinary fire structural damage to wood structures and 1d8 / 10 extraordinary structural fire damage to stone structures. (It might deal less if the structure is not entirely in its area of effect.) It causes combustibles (such as military oil or petards) to ignite.

###### Fate

Divine 5 Type: detection, esoteric

Range: touchDuration: until it happens

This spell grants the caster a prophetic insight into what the future holds for the creature touched. While the exact date and place are not known, a general indication of the creature’s *fate*will be provided. The specific *fate*revealed may be determined by the Judge, or rolled randomly on the table below.

*Fate* is not entirely unalterable; a character can still die from gross stupidity and recklessness, or by willfully avoiding his fate (e.g. suicide). In most cases, however, a character’s *fate*will be fulfilled. A character who has not yet fulfilled his fate gains a +4 bonus when rolling on the Mortal Wounds tables (p. XX). A character who has already fulfilled his fate suffers a -4 penalty when rolling on the Mortal Wounds tables. The Judge is the final arbiter of whether a character has fulfilled his *fate*. Henchmen and hirelings are always reluctant to learn their *fate*, and forcing them to do so counts as a calamity (p. XX). A character cannot have two or more *fates*simultaneously. A character who is slain with an unfulfilled *fate* and later restored to life retains his *fate*. A character who fulfills his *fate*cannot have another *fate*unless he is slain and restored to life.

###### Fiery Pillar

Divine 5 Type: blast, elemental (fire)

Range: 90’Duration: instantaneous

This spell conjures a burning pillar of divine fire 30’ high and 10’ in diameter centered on a target point. Each creature within the pillar must make a Blast saving throw. If the save fails, the creature suffers 6d8 extraordinary luminous fire damage. If the save succeeds, the creature suffers half that damage.

The*fiery pillar* can also damage structures in its area of effect. It deals up to 6d8/3 extraordinary fire structural damage to wood structures and 6d8/10 to stone structures. (It might deal less if the structure is not entirely in its area of effect.) It causes combustibles (such as military oil or petards) to ignite.

###### Fillet and Serve

Arcane 5, Divine 6 Type: death, necromancy

Range: 120’Duration: special

This spell can debone a living target and then animate its extracted skeleton. The target of *fillet and serve*must make a Death saving throw. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect. If the save fails, the target’s own skeleton rips itself out of its body, killing the creature instantly. The extracted skeleton is then animated as an undead creature with Hit Dice equal to the monster’s Baseline HD. (For skeletons of humans or demi-humans, this means one Hit Die, regardless of the character level of the deceased).

The caster can give verbal orders to the skeleton when he first animates it and thereafter anytime it is in line of sight on his initiative. Complex or extensive orders require the caster to expend action in lieu of moving, but simple orders (“protect me!”) do not require an action. Orders can be given in any language the caster speaks. The skeleton will mindlessly obey whatever orders it is given to the best of its (limited) ability. It cannot accomplish tasks that require abstract thought or higher reasoning. If it completes all of its orders, or for whatever reason is physically unable to obey its orders, the skeleton will simply remain stationary until it receives new orders. The skeleton acts on its own initiative each round.

###### Fireball

Arcane 3 Type: blast, elemental (fire)

Range: 360’Duration: instantaneous

This spell creates an explosion of flame that detonates with a low roar into a 20’ diameter sphere centered on a target point. Each creature in the area of effect must make a Blast saving throw. If the save fails, the creature suffers 1d6 points of extraordinary fire damage per caster level. If the save succeeds, the creature suffers half that damage. The explosion creates almost no pressure.

To cast the spell, the caster points his finger in the direction he wants to fire while mentally designating the range (distance and height) at which the *fireball*is to explode. A pea-sized sphere of fire then shoots from the pointing finger and, unless it impacts an interposing barrier before reaching its specified distance, explodes into the *fireball* at the target point. An early impact results in an early detonation. If the caster attempts to send the bead through a narrow passage, such as through an arrow slit, he must make a successful missile attack throw (without range adjustments) to pass through the opening. Otherwise, the spell strikes the barrier and detonates prematurely.

The*fireball* can also damage structures in its area of effect. It deals up to 1d6 extraordinary fire structural damage per caster level to wood structures and one-third that to stone structures. (It might deal less if the structure is not entirely in its area of effect.) It causes combustibles (such as military oil or petards) to ignite. If the damage caused to an interposing structure is enough to shatter or break through it, the *fireball* will continue beyond the barrier in order to attain its full volume.

###### Firestorm

Arcane 5 Type: blast, elemental (fire)

Range: 225’Duration: instantaneous

The caster conjures a storm of burning alchemical naphtha 20’ in diameter centered on a target point. Each creature within the *firestorm* must make a Blast saving throw. If the save fails, the creature suffers 1d6 extraordinary fire damage per caster level and is engulfedin burning naphtha. If the save succeeds, the creature suffers half that damage but is not engulfed.

A creature engulfed in burning naphtha fire suffers an additional 1d8 extraordinary fire damage at the start of its initiative each round. At the end of its initiative, it must make a Blast saving throw. If the save fails, it continues to be engulfed next round. If the save succeeds, the alchemical naphtha sputters out and the creature takes no further damage. The alchemical naphtha cannot be put out by immersion in water, but a *counterspell*can extinguish it on one creature or object and a *dispel**magic*can **dispel** the entire fire.

Like a *fireball*,a *firestorm* can also damage structures in its area of effect. It deals up to 1d6 extraordinary fire structural damage per caster level to wood structures and one-third that to stone structures. (It might deal less if the structure is not entirely in its area of effect.) It causes combustibles (such as military oil or petards) to ignite. Thereafter it deals 1d8 extraordinary fire structural damage to wooden structures and one-third that to stone structures each round until the fire is put out. The structure can save as a 0th level fighter each round.

###### Flay the Slain

Arcane 5 Type: death

Range: 45’ Duration: 1 day

This horrific spell flays the flesh off of one or more eligible corpses in range, then animates the bloody skins as **flay fiends** (see ***Monstrous Manual*** for characteristics). The caster can flay and animate a number of dead corpses up to his caster level each time he casts the spell. A flay fiend can only be created from the corpse of a humanoid with 1 Baseline HD or less with mostly intact skin; burned corpses, decayed corpses older than 2 weeks, and corpses of larger humanoids cannot be used. The flay fiends created by this spell last until destroyed or dispelled, or until one day elapses. The flay fiends thereafter crumble into dust.

###### Flesh to Ash

Arcane 4 , Divine 6 Type: death

Range: 120’Duration: instantaneous

This spell can reduce a living target to ash and dust. The target must be made of flesh and have fewer than 9 HD. The target creature must make a Death saving throw. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect. If the save fails, the creature is slain and its remains reduced to a small pile of dust. Any objects carried or worn by the creature are not affected.

###### Flight

Arcane 3 Type: movement

Range: touchDuration: 1 turn per level

This spell allows the recipient to fly in any direction at a combat speed of 120’ per round and an encounter speed of 360’ per turn. The speed is reduced by encumbrance, however, and the recipient cannot fly carrying more weight than its maximum load. Flying under the effect of this spell requires only as much concentration as walking, so the recipient can attack or cast spells normally. If a *flight*spell is **dispelled** or its duration expires while the recipient is flying, the former recipient of *flight*will plummet from the air.

###### Force of Impetus

Arcane 3 Type: elemental (earth), movement

Range: 90’Duration: instantaneous

This spell flings one or more objects or creatures within range and line of sight a distance of up to 20’. The caster can target one creature or object per caster level. Each object or creature must weigh 2 stone (20 lbs) per caster level or less. Alternatively, the caster can target a single creature or object weighing 2 stone (20 lbs) per caster level squared. Each targeted creature can make a Spells saving throw to resist the effect. If the save succeeds, the spell does not affect the creature. If the save fails, it is affected as above.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Creature / Object’s Weight** | **Damage Dealt** |
| Up to 4 stone (≤40 lbs) | 1d6 |
| 4 stone to 8 stone (41 – 80 lbs) | 2d6 |
| 9 stone to 15 stone (81 – 150 lbs) | 3d6 (5’ radius) |
| 16 stone to 30 stone (151 – 300 lbs) | 4d6 (10’ radius) |
| 31 stone to 60 stone (301 – 600 lbs) | 5d6 (15’ radius) |
| 61 stone to 120 stone (601 – 1,200 lbs) | 6d6 (15’ radius) |
| 121 stone to 240 stone (1,201 – 2,400 lbs) | 8d6 (15’ radius) |
| 241 stone to 392 stone (2,401 – 4,800 lbs) | 10d6 (20’ radius) |

The affected creatures or objects can be flung in any direction the caster chooses. If the caster wishes to fling one or more of the affected creatures or objects into another creature, or onto a specific hard-to-reach location (such as a balcony or pit), he must make a successful attack throw. A throw of a single creature or object may be aimed without penalty, but each additional object or creature imposes a cumulative -1 penalty to the caster’s attack throws. If an aimed throw misses, it scatters like thrown oil.

Creatures or objects flung into walls or other hard surfaces will suffer bludgeoning damage. Creatures or objects will also deal bludgeoning damage to whatever they strike. The amount of damage will be based on the flung creature or object’s weight, as shown on the adjoining table. Large flung objects will also deal damage to an area of effect around their point of impact. Creatures in this area of effect can avoid taking any damage with a successful Blast saving throw, but creatures actually struck by the flung object cannot avoid the damage. Damage from flung objects converts into shp at a rate of 1 shp per 5 points of damage.

EXAMPLE: Quintus, a 9th level mage, is supporting a company of mercenaries during a siege. The mercenaries are suffering from the fire of a light catapult (120 st). Quintus casts *force of impetus*, enabling him to fling up to 9 objects of up to 18 stone each, or a single object of up to (9 x 9 x 2) 162 stone. He opts for the latter, and flings the light catapult onto its own four crew members. He makes a successful attack throw against one of the crew’s AC. That crew member takes 5d6 damage (and dies!). The other three crew members, all within 15’, must make Blast saves or suffer 5d6 damage each. The light catapult itself takes 5d6/5 shp, enough to destroy it.

###### Forest Enchantment

Arcane 5 Type: enchantment

Range: 0’Duration: special

This spell enchants all of the plants in a 240’ radius around the caster. Thereafter the caster, and any allies he “introduces” to the plants as friends, can move among the normal plants in the area of effect free from intentional or accidental harm — rose bushes will twist so that their thorns do not pierce him, poisonous ivy will not leak oil onto him, tree branches and roots will shift slightly so as not to trip him, and so on.

In addition, the enchantedplants will be hostile to enemies of the caster who intrude upon the area; trespassers will find that thorns bite them, branches and roots entangle them, and leaves whistle where they pass. In game terms, the caster and his allies gain a +1 bonus to surprise rolls and improved movement multipliers in the area of effect, while enemies suffer a -1 penalty to surprise rolls and worsened movement multipliers in the area of effect.

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Terrain** | **Allied Move**  **Multiplier** | **Enemy Move**  **Multiplier** |
| Hills, forest, scrubland | x1 | x1/2 |
| Mountain, jungle | x2/3 | x1/3 |

Ordinary plants do not receive a saving throw when the spell is cast. Each season thereafter they receive a saving throw to break the spell, however. The Judge should roll once for all normal plants in the area of effect as if they were a 1 HD monster. If the save fails, the *forest enchantment*remains in effect. If the save succeeds, the spell immediately ends.

If any semi-sapient or sapient plants are within the area of effect when the spell is cast, each such plant must make a Spells saving throw. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect on that plant. If the save fails, that plant is **bewitched**. The effects are identical to *beguile humanoid*, p. XX). Once in effect, the bewitchment lasts until dispelled or until the creature makes a successful Spells saving throw. The plant receives a saving throw to break the spell each day if it has 9 HD or more, every week if it has 5 – 8 HD, and every month if it has fewer than 5 HD.

If the caster ever does severe damage to the plants in the area of effect (such as clear cutting the trees), the *forest enchantment*is immediately **dispelled** and cannot thereafter be cast again on the same plants. However, gathering fallen wood, picking fruit and flowers, trimming leaves, and similar gardening does not end the *forest enchantment*.

Although this spell does not grant the caster any special means of communication with the affected plants*, forest enchantment* is a favorite of elves and wizards who commonly cast it in the vicinity of their fastnesses and towers. Because it relies on an abundance of plant life to have any effect,  *forest enchantment* cannot be cast in barens, desert, grasslands (steppe), hills (rocky), mountains (rocky/snowy), or shrubland (low and sparse).

###### Forgetfulness

Arcane 5 , Divine 5 Type: enchantment

Range: 30’Duration: perpetual

This spell can induce forgetfulness in 2d4 living humanoid targets. If a target has fewer than 2 HD, it is automatically affected by the spell. If a target has 2 HD or more, it must make a Spells saving throw. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect on that target. If the save fails, that target is affected by the spell. Affected creatures lose all memory of the minute (1 round) before the spell was cast and form no memories of anything that happens during the subsequent 10 minutes (1 turn) after the spell was cast.

While under the immediate influence of the spell, the affected creatures are **mesmerized**, as if lost in thought or day dreaming. If attacked, they will defend themselves, but otherwise they will not interfere with the activities of other creatures. When the spell ends, the creatures are not aware of having been affected; they simply feel as if they have come out of a day dream or lapse in attention.

*Forgetfulness* is perpetual. Affected creatures regain memories lost to this spell when the effect is **dispelled** or expires due to the caster’s death or decision not to continue to sustain it. Affected creatures do notrecover memories they never formed, i.e. anything that happened in the subsequent 10 minutes after the spell was cast. *Forgetfulness*counts as a **bewitchment** for purposes of *discern**magic*and *discern**bewitchment*.

###### Frighten Beast

Divine 1 Type: enchantment

Range: 90’Duration: 3 turns

This spell can frighten a living animal target. The target must make a Paralysis saving throw. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect. If the save fails, the target is **frightened** for the duration of the spell, or until the effect is **dispelled** normally or by*remove**fear*.

A **frightened** creature cannot attack, cast spells, or speak (except to scream in stark terror). A **frightened** creature will run from the source of its fear at its full speed for the duration of the spell. If a **frightened** creature cannot flee, it cowers in terror. An **engaged** creature that is **frightened** will cower in terror until it is able to disengage with defensive movement. It suffers a -2 penalty to AC and cannot attack, cast spells, move, or take any other actions until the condition ends.

###### Frighten Humanoid

Arcane 1 Type: enchantment

Range: 90’Duration: 3 turns

This spell can frighten a living humanoid target. The target must make a Paralysis saving throw. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect. If the save fails, the target is **frightened** for the duration of the spell, or until the effect is **dispelled** normallyor by*remove fear*.The effect is identical to that of *frighten beast*, above.

###### Frostbite

Arcane 2 Type: blast, death, elemental (water)

Range: 90’Duration: 1 round per caster level

This spell exposes a target creature to bitter cold. The target must make a Death saving throw. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect. If the save fails, the target immediately suffers 1d6 magical cold damage. At the start of the caster’s initiative for each round of the spell’s duration, the target suffers another 1d6 magical cold damage. At the end of the spell’s duration, the target becomes frostbitten and must roll 1d6 on the 16-20 row of the Mortal Wounds – Savage table (p. XX), possibly losing fingers, toes, an ear, or even his nose. If the spell is dispelled before its duration expires, the target does not become frostbitten.

###### Gale of Wind

Arcane 2 , Divine 4 Type: blast, elemental (air)

Range: 0’Duration: 1 round

This spell creates a strong blast of air that originates from the caster and affects all creatures in a cone 10’ in diameter and 60’ in length. Each creature in the *gale*when the spell is cast, or which enters the gale on its initiative, must make a Blast saving throw. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect on that creature. If the save fails, the effect of the *gale*depends on the size of the creature affected:

* Tiny creatures and objects on the ground are knocked prone and pushed back 1d4 x 10, taking 1d4 points of nonlethal bludgeoning damage. Tiny creatures and objects in the air are pushed back 2d6 x 10’ feet and take 2d6 points of nonlethal bludgeoning damage.
* Small creatures and objects on the ground are knocked prone by the force of the wind. Small creatures or objects in the air are knocked back 1d6x10 feet.
* Man-sized creatures and objects on the ground suffer no effects. Man-sized creatures or objects in the air are pushed back 1d6x5.
* Large or larger creatures or objects suffer no effects.

Missile attack throws within or through a *gale**of**wind* suffer a -4 penalty, as do proficiency throws to hear noise. The force of the *gale*automatically extinguishes any candles, torches, or other unprotected flames. It extinguishes protected flames unless the bearer succeeds on a Paralysis saving throw. A *gale**of**wind*will also do anything that a sudden blast of 50 mph wind would be expected to do, such as fan a large fire, overturn delicate awnings, create a spray of dust, or blow vapors out of range (Judge’s discretion).

###### Gaseous Form

Arcane 3 Type: elemental (air), transmogrification

Range: 90’Duration: 6 turns

This spell can cause a target creature of man-size or smaller to immediately be transformed into a translucent cloud of gas. If the creature is a willing recipient of the spell, it is automatically transformed. If the creature is an unwilling target, it must make a Spells saving throw. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect. If the save fails, the creature is transformed. Once transformed, any objects the creature was carrying or wearing immediately fall to the floor.

While in*gaseous form*, a creature cannot attack, cast spells, speak, or use magic items or equipment. It gains a combat speed of 40’ and an encounter speed of 120’ per turn. The gaseous creature’s movement makes no noise and it can flow below doors and other small spaces that are not sealed airtight. A gaseous creature has an AC of 11 and is immune to mundane damage.

###### Giant Strength

Arcane 4 , Divine 5 Type: transmogrification

Range: touchDuration: 3 turns

This spell imbues the recipient with the strength of a giant. The recipient gains +2 to melee attack throws and deals an additional die of damage with every melee or thrown attack that deals physical damage. If his attack already deals a set of damage dice, it deals an additional set of damage dice with every melee or thrown attack (e.g. 4d6 instead of 2d6) that deals physical damage. The damage dealt becomes extraordinary if it was not already. The recipient also gains a +8 bonus to Dungeonbashing proficiency throws and doubles his normal carrying capacity. The recipient must be man-sized or smaller when this spell is cast or it fails to work.

This spell cannot be combined with any other magical effects that influence strength or size, but it does stack with the recipient’s normal bonus or penalty from Strength — a weak character who is enchanted with this spell has the strength of a weak giant, while a very strong character would gain the strength of a very strong giant!

###### Growth\*

Arcane 3 , Divine 4 Type: transmogrification

Range: touchDuration: 12 turns

This spell **enlarges** a humanoid recipient by one size category. All equipment worn or carried by the recipient is similarly enlarged by the spell, though this change has no effect on the magical properties of any such equipment. Any enlarged item that leaves the recipient’s possession instantly returns to its normal size. The recipient must be man-sized or smaller when this spell is cast or it fails to work.

When **enlarged**,  the recipient becomes two times as tall and eight times as heavy as he is ordinarily. His strength increases proportionately, such that he gains +2 to melee attack throws and deals an additional die of damage with every melee or thrown attack that deals physical damage. If his attack already deals a set of damage dice, it deals an additional set of damage dice with every melee or thrown attack (e.g. 4d6 instead of 2d6) that deals physical damage. The damage dealt becomes extraordinary if it was not already. The recipient also gains a +8 bonus to Dungeonbashing proficiency throws and doubles his normal carrying capacity. (Any equipment he was carrying or wearing now also has twice as much encumbrance.)

The reverse of this spell, *shrinking*, reduces a humanoid recipient and everything he carries by one size category. A **shrunk** recipient becomes half as tall and one-eighth as heavy as he is ordinarily. His strength decreases proportionately, such that he suffers -2 to melee attack throws, deals half damage with physical attacks, and halves his carrying capacity. He also takes a -8 penalty to Dungeonbashing proficiency throws. (Any equipment he was carrying or wearing now have half as much encumbrance.) The effects are not all bad, however; the recipient gains a +4 bonus to Hiding and Sneaking. If unproficient, he is treated as proficient with a throw of 14+.

This spell does not otherwise stack with effects that influence strength or size, but it does stack with the character’s normal bonus or penalty from Strength. If a creature under the effect of a *growth*spell is subject to *shrinking*, or vice versa, both spells are cancelled.

###### Growth, Beast

Divine 3 Type: transmogrification

Range: touchDuration: 12 turns

This spell can enlarge a target animal of large size or smaller. The animal can, but does not have to, make a Spells saving throw to resist. Most animals will choose to make the save, but if the animal is **bewitched** by the caster, has been befriended by the caster using Beast Friendship or *speak with beasts*, or was personally raised and trained by the caster, the animal will trust the caster enough to refuse its saving throw.

If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect. If the save fails or is refused, the target animal is **enlarged**. If an enlarged animal has not previously been enlarged or was not cautioned as to what would occur through, e.g. *speak**with**beasts*, it will become panicked and confused when enlarged. Treat the animal as subject to the effects of *incite**madness* spell until it returns to its original size.

The effects of *beast growth* are otherwise identical to that of *growth*, above. Note that the spell gives no means of command or influence over the enlarged animals.

###### Growth, Plant\*

Arcane 4 , Divine 5 Type: transmogrification

Range: 180’Duration: perpetual

This spell transforms a target patch of ordinary vegetation (grasses, briars, bushes, creepers, thistles, trees, vines, etc.) up to 3,000 square feet in size into a dense overgrown thicket. The thicket is impassable to creatures of man-size or large size. Such creatures can hack their way through the thicket using an axe or short sword at a combat speed of 5’ per round. Small creatures and huge, gigantic, or colossal creatures do not need to hack their way through but move at half normal speed.

The reverse form, *plant**shrinkage*, transforms a target thicket of overgrown and impassable vegetation into a patch of grass and brush that can be easily traversed.

Both *plant**growth* and *plant**shrinkage* are perpetual in duration, lasting until **dispelled** or countered by the reversed spell, or until the caster dies or stops sustaining it. Neither spell has any effect on plant creatures of any sort.

###### Guise Other

Arcane 5 , Divine 6 Type: transmogrification

Range: touchDuration: 1 day

This spell grants the caster the ability to alter a recipient’s shape into that of any other humanoid creature. The caster can control the recipient’s new shape’s physical qualities (such as height, weight, gender, hair color, hair texture, and skin color) within the normal ranges for a creature of its kind. The recipient’ equipment, if any, remains worn or held where possible, and otherwise melds into the new form. If used in conjunction with a successful Disguise proficiency throw by the caster, *guise other*can allow the recipient to appear as a specific individual. The recipient must be man-sized or smaller when this spell is cast or it fails to work.

###### Guise Self

Arcane 4 , Divine 5 Type: transmogrification

Range: self Duration: 1 day

This spell grants the caster the ability to alter his shape into that of any other humanoid creature. The caster can control his new shape’s physical qualities (such as height, weight, gender, hair color, hair texture, and skin color) within the normal ranges for a creature of its kind. His equipment, if any, remains worn or held where possible, and otherwise melds into the new form. If used in conjunction with a successful Disguise proficiency throw, *guise self* can allow the caster to appear as a specific individual. The caster must be man-sized or smaller when this spell is cast or it fails to work.

###### Halt Humanoids

Arcane 2, Divine 2 Type: enchantment

Range: 90’Duration: 1 round/caster level

This spell can render 1d4 living humanoid targets mute and motionless. Each target must make a Paralysis saving throw. If the save succeeds, the target is not affected. If the save fails, the target is **paralyzed** for the duration of the spell or until the effect is **dispelled** or removed by a **cure** spell.

A paralyzed creature is **helpless** and **mute**. A **paralyzed** winged creature cannot flap its wings and falls if in flight at the time. A **paralyzed** swimmer can’t swim and will drown if unable to breathe water.

###### Halt Monsters

Arcane 4 Type: enchantment

Range: 180’Duration: 2d8 turns

This spell can render 1d4 living targets mute and motionless. Each target must make a Paralysis saving throw. If the save succeeds, the target is not affected. If the save fails, the target is paralyzed for the duration of the spell or until the effect is **dispelled** or removed by a **cure** spell. The effect is otherwise identical to *halt humanoid*, above.

###### Healing Circle

Divine 5 Type: healing

Range: 30’Duration: instantaneous

This spell immediately heals one or more living recipients. The *healing circle*can affect one creature per caster level within 30’. Each recipient instantly regains 1d6+1 hit points. The spell can also be used to cure paralysis in one, some, or all of the recipients, but does not then cure any damage in them. The spell will never increase a creature’s hit points beyond the normal amount.

*Healing circle* can be used to treat several unconscious combatants’ wounds simultaneously from a safe distance. However, because it only heals 1d6+1 damage, it only counts as a 1st level spell that grants a +1 bonus on the Mortal Wounds table (p. XX).

###### Hidden Host

Arcane 4 , Divine 6 Type: illusion

Range: 240’Duration: special

This spell conceals a complete military unit of up to 120 man-sized creatures, 60 large (cavalry or ogre-sized) creatures, 20 huge creatures, 5 gigantic creatures, or 1 colossal creature. The creatures of the *hidden**host*appear to be natural effects of the terrain (trees in a forest, stalagmites in a cave, coral reefs in a sea, boulders on a rocky slope, snow drifts on a tundra, shrubs on a moor, etc.). The entirety of the *hidden**host* must be within range of the caster at the time the spell is cast. Only those creatures the caster wishes to hide are affected, and then only if they are willing to be concealed. The caster may include himself among the affected creatures.

The affected creatures are concealed from visual detection by others passing the area for so long as they remain relatively still. An affected creature can sit down or stand up, drink water from a canteen, relieve itself, unsheathe a weapon, or take other actions without revealing itself, but if it ever moves more than 5’ or attacks, the illusion is dispelled for that creature. Casting or concentrating on a spell does not cause an affected creature to be revealed unless the spell affects enemies. Creatures who remain still continue to be hidden. The caster may end the spell early if he wishes by speaking a single word. The illusion is otherwise perpetual, lasting until dispelled or until the caster dies or decides to stop sustaining it. The illusion that conceals the *hidden**host*cannot be disbelieved.

###### Holy Blessing\*

Divine 2 Type: esoteric, protection

Range: selfDuration: 6 turns

This spell fills the caster and up to 30 allied recipients of his choice within 15’ with courage and hope. Each **blessed** recipient gains a bonus of +1 to attack throws, armor class, morale rolls (for monsters or NPCs allied with the caster), and saving throws against magical **fear**. The spell cannot affect creatures who have attacked enemies on their most recent initiative, so it is best cast before a battle begins.

Divine casters of 7th level or higher can use *holy**blessing*to create holy water. One casting of *holy**blessing*will transform 1 pint of ordinary water into holy water. Casting *holy**blessing*in this manner demands a sacrifice to the caster’s deity worth at least 10gp. Once created, holy water will retain its potency indefinitely so long as it is kept in the vial it was blessed in. See the **Equipment Descriptions** in Chapter 4 for information on holy water.

The reverse of *holy**blessing*is called *unholy* *blessing*. It fills the caster and up to 30 allied recipients of his choice within 15’ with fanatical hate and zealotry. Each recipient gains a bonus of +1 to attack throws, armor class, morale rolls (for monsters or NPCs allied with the caster), and saving throws against magical **fear**. *Unholy**blessing*can also be used by chaotic divine casters of 7th level or higher, in conjunction with a sacrifice of at least 10gp, to create a vial of unholy water. Unholy water has beneficial effects when used in the animation of the dead. See *animate**undead*, above.

###### Holy Chant

Divine 2 Type: protection

Range: selfDuration: concentration

This spell is intoned continuously, bringing about supernatural intervention centered on the divine spellcaster and affecting up to 30 allied recipients within a 15’ radius of the caster. The caster, and recipients within 15’ radius of the caster, gain a +2 bonus to saving throws. This effect continues so long as the caster maintains concentration or until dispelled. A *noiselessness* spell that affects the caster also instantly ends the spell.

###### Holy Circle\*

Divine 1 Type: protection

Range: self Duration: concentration

This spell creates a *holy circle* of protection around the caster with a 10’ radius. The circle surrounds the caster for the duration of the spell and provides protection from attacks by enchanted creatures and evil creatures. Enchanted creatures include constructs, incarnations, or undead, or any conjured or summoned creature regardless of type, or any other type of creature designated in the ***Monstrous Manual***as enchanted. Evil creatures include enemy creatures of an alignment other than the caster’s alignment, and inherently evil creatures such as incarnations or undead of Chaotic alignment.

The *holy* *circle* blocks enchanted creatures from entering its area of effect as if it were an impermeable barrier. As a result, the enchanted creatures cannot make attacks on creatures within the circle with their natural weapons. The *holy* *circle’s* barrier to enchanted creatures expires if the caster or any protected creature makes an attack against, casts a spell on, or tries to force the barrier against a blocked creature.

The *holy* *circle* does not block evil creatures from entering its area of effect, but provides some defense against them. All creatures within the radius gain a +1 bonus to AC and a +1 bonus on saving throws against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures.

Creatures can leave and then re-enter, or enter after the spell is cast, and still receive the protection of the *circle*. The *holy* *circle* lasts as long as the caster remains stationary and concentrates on it.

Reversed, this spell becomes *unholy**circle*. Like its counterpart, *unholy**circle*protects the caster from attacks by enemy creatures of an alignment other than the caster’s and blocks enchanted creatures from entering its area of effect. However, instead of protecting the occupants of the *circle* from inherently evil creatures, *unholy**circle*protects them from inherently good creatures (e.g. incarnations of Lawful alignment).

###### Holy Circle, Sustained\*

Divine 3 Type: protection

Range: self Duration: 12 turns

This spell functions exactly as *holy**circle*, but with a duration of 12 turns. The holy circle will move with the caster, who does not need to concentrate to maintain its protection.

Reversed, this spell becomes *unholy**circle,**sustained*, and functions exactly as *unholy**circle*, except with a duration of 12 turns without the need for concentration.

###### Holy Prayer

Divine 3 Type: movement

Range: 90’Duration: 1 round

This spell imbues up to one recipient per caster level with powerful divine energies. On its next initiative, each recipient can move at double its normal speed and can make one additional attack. Spellcasting is not accelerated, nor is the use of magic items such as wands, which may still be used just once per round. Multiple speed effects don’t combine; only apply the most powerful or longest lasting effect.

###### Home Ward

Divine 6 Type: protection

Range: 15’ Duration: indefinite

This spell places a protective *ward* on the structure touched. The structure can be up to 10,000 cubic feet in size. For instance, the spell could protect a 20’ square 25’ tall tower or a 33’ square 9’ tall cottage. (Larger structures can be protected by multiple wards.) Once placed, a *home**ward*remains until either **dispelled** or triggered by an incarnation entering the structure it wards. When the *home**ward* is triggered, the incarnation that triggered it must make a Spells saving throw. If the save fails, the creature is dispelled back to its home plane. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect. In either case, the *home**ward* vanishes. A *home**ward* leaves no visible mark on the structure it protects, but its presence can be revealed by *discern**magic*, *true**seeing***,** or similar spells.

###### Hypnotic Sigil

Arcane 2 Type: enchantment

Range: 90’ Duration: concentration

This spell creates a magical sigil that radiates mesmerizing color and light in a cone 60’ long and 30’ wide. Each living humanoid in the cone that beholds the sigil must make a Paralysis saving throw. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect on that target. If the save fails, the target is **mesmerized**. A mesmerized creature cannot attack, cast spells, move, speak, or take any other action (although it can still defend itself). The *hypnotic sigil*lasts as long as the spellcaster maintains concentration or until **dispelled**.

###### Ice Floe

Arcane 1 Type: elemental (water), wall

Range: touch Duration: 8 hours

This spell instantly freezes a portion of a body of water that the caster touches, creating a flat pack of ice that floats on the remaining water. The *ice**floe*created by the spell may be up to 10’ long and 10’ wide and up to 1’ thick, for a total volume of up to 100 cubic feet. The *ice**floe’s* length, width, and thickness cannot exceed the length, width, and depth of the body of water from which it is created. It cannot be evoked so that it appears where objects or creatures already are. The water inside a living creature cannot be turned into an *ice**floe*, no matter how large the creature is.

As ice is less dense than water, the top of the ice floe will be about 10% higher than the surface of the water. A typical 1’ thick *ice**floe*will stick up about 1.25” above the water. The *ice**floe*can support up to 5 lbs of creatures or objects per cubic foot while remaining afloat, but any additional weight will cause the *ice**floe* to sink below the surface of the water. If the caster concentrates while touching the ice floe, he can magically move it across the water at a combat speed of 20’ per round.

The *ice**floe*is only as resilient as any other large block of frozen water. It counts as a structure with AC 2 and 5 shp. Man-sized creatures, large creatures, and light ballista cannot deal damage to the ice floe. Huge creatures, non-magical fire, and magic can deal 1/5th damage. Artillery, gigantic creatures, and magical fire can deal full damage.

When an *ice**floe* is created in above-freezing temperatures, it will melt after 8 hours. *Counterspell* or *dispel**magic* will instantly melt an *ice**floe*in above-freezing temperatures. Otherwise when the spell expires or **dispelled**, the caster loses the ability to magically move the *ice**floe*, but it does not melt until temperatures rise. (That is to say, the ice doesn’t magically heat up!)

###### Ice Sheet

Arcane 3 Type: elemental (water), wall

Range: 45’ Duration: perpetual

This spell instantly freezes a large volume of water in range, creating a thick sheet of ice that floats on the remaining water. The *ice sheet*created by the spell can be either 1”, 4”, 1’, or 10’ thick.

A 1” thick *ice**sheet*can have a maximum surface area of 180,000 square feet (approximately 240’ radius), a 4” thick sheet can have a maximum surface area of 45,000 square feet (approximately 120’ radius), a 1’ thick sheet can have a maximum surface area of 15,000 square feet (approximately 70’ radius), and a 10’ thick sheet can have a maximum surface area of 1,500 square feet (approximately 20’ radius).

The *ice**sheet’s* surface area and thickness cannot exceed the surface area and depth of the body of water from which it is created. It cannot be evoked so that it appears where objects or creatures already are, but it can be evoked over creatures under the water. The water inside a living creature cannot be turned into an *ice**sheet*, no matter how large the creature is.

As ice is less dense than water, the top of the *ice**sheet* will be about 10% higher than the surface of the water. A 1” thick *ice**sheet*will be about 1/8” above the water, a 4” thick sheet will be about 3/8” above the water, a 1’ thick onewill be about 1.25” above the water, and a 10’ thick one about 1’.

Creatures can safely move across the *ice**sheet* at their encounter speed. Creatures moving across the sheet at their combat speed must make a proficiency throw of 2+ each round or fall prone. Creatures moving across the sheet at their running speed must make a proficiency throw each round with a target value equal to their encumbrance, or fall prone.

The *ice**sheet*can support a maximum weight of 75,000 lbs across its entire surface. Any additional weight will cause the *ice sheet* to sink below the surface of the water. In addition, heavy creatures might break through the ice beneath their feet. A 1” thick sheet can only support small creatures (less than 35 lbs). A 4” thick sheet can support man-sized creatures (up to 400 lbs). A 1’ thick sheet can support large creatures (up to 2,000 lbs). A 10’ thick sheet can support gigantic creatures (up to 32,000 lbs). For each size category by which a creature exceeds the *ice**sheet’s* limit, the ice has a 1 in 6 chance each round of breaking beneath their feet. When this occurs, the creature falls into the water. Creatures in icy water also suffer 1 point of cold damage per round and must make a Swimming throw or begin drowning (see p. XX). If the creature passes the Swimming throw, it may pull itself back onto the safety of the ice on its initiative (although the ice may break again).

EXAMPLE: Quintus is being pursued by an ogre. His escape is blocked by a 500’ wide river. He casts *ice sheet*and creates a 90’ wide, 500’ long, 4” bridge of ice across the river. As a man-sized creature, Quintus is able to safely cross the sheet. The ogre is a large-sized creature, however, and may break through the 4” thick ice. It is one size category larger than the 4” sheet’s limit, so it has a 1 in 6 chance each round of breaking through. Assuming the ogre crosses at its combat speed of 30’ per round, it will require 17 rounds to get across the ice….

The *ice**sheet*is only as resilient as any other large block of frozen water. It counts as a structure with AC 2 and 1 shp per 20 cubic foot area. Man-sized creatures, large creatures, and light ballista cannot deal damage to the ice floe. Huge creatures, non-magical fire, and magic can deal 1/5th damage. Artillery, gigantic creatures, and magical fire can deal full damage.

Once created an *ice**sheet*is perpetual until dispelled. *Counterspell* or *dispel magic* will instantly melt an *ice sheet*in above-freezing temperatures. Otherwise when the spell expires or is **dispelled**, it does not melt until temperatures rise. (That is to say, the ice doesn’t magically heat up!)

###### Ice Storm

Arcane 5 Type: blast, elemental (water)

Range: 360’ Duration: 1 round

This spell conjures a 20’ diameter storm of freezing, razor-sharp hail that rains down from the heavens around a target point. Any creatures or objects that begin their initiative in, or enter, the *ice storm* suffer 1d4 points of extraordinary cold damage per caster level, or half that amount with a successful Blast saving throw. Any movement through the *ice**storm’s* area of effectis at half normal rate.

The*ice**storm* can also damage structures in its area of effect. It deals up to 1d4 extraordinary cold structural damage per caster level to wooden structures and one-third that damage to stone structures. (It might deal less if the structure is not entirely in its area of effect.) Any non-magical fires (burning pitch, campfires, torches, etc.) within the cone are automatically extinguished.

If this spell is cast indoors or underground, the *ice**storm* will strike the ceiling or surface above the desired area of effect. If the damage caused to an interposing structure shatters or breaks through it, the *ice**storm* will continue beyond the barrier in order to attain its full volume.

###### Illumination\*

Arcane 1, Divine 1 Type: esoteric

Range: 180’ Duration: 6 turns + 1 turn/caster level

This spell creates a spherical region of light around the target location or object. The *illumination*approximates that cast by a torch. It sheds bright light out to a 15’ radius and dim light to a 30’ radius. The effect is immobile if cast into an area, but it can be cast on a movable object.

Reversed, *illumination*becomes *tenebrosity*, creating a tenebrous area of darkness. The *tenebrosity*is as dark as a moonless night out to 15’ and as dark as a moonlit night to a 30’ radius. The *tenebrosity* also blocks out **lightless vision** and negates mundane light sources out to 30’.

Sometimes the effects of *illumination*and *tenebrosity*might come into conflict. For instance, an *illuminated*object might be carried into a *tenebrous*area, or a *tenebrosity*spell might be cast in an *illuminated*area. In either case, the level of the respective spellcasters determines the result. If the caster of *illumination* is 3 or more caster levels higher than the caster of *tenebrosity*, then the *tenebrosity* is extinguished. If the caster of *tenebrosity* is 3 or more caster levels higher than the caster of *illumination*, then the *illumination* is extinguished. In any other case, both spells are extinguished, restoring the existing ambient light level.

###### Illumination, Perpetual\*

Arcane 3, Divine 3 Type: esoteric

Range: 480’ Duration: perpetual

This spell creates a spherical region of bright light around a target location or object. The *perpetual**illumination* produces full daylight out to 30’; bright torchlight out to an additional 30’; and dim light out to an additional 30’ beyond that (90’ total). The effect is immobile if cast into an area, but it can be cast on a movable object.

Reversed, *perpetual**illumination*becomes *perpetual**tenebrosity*, creating a tenebrous area of pitch darkness. The *perpetual**tenebrosity*is pitch dark out to 30’, as dark as a moonless night for another 30’, and as dark as a moonlit night for an additional 30’ beyond that (90’ total). The darkness blocks out **lightless vision** and negates mundane light sources out to 90’.

If an *illuminated*objectenters the area of effect of *perpetual**tenebrosity*, or a *tenebrous*object enters the area of effect of *perpetual**illumination*, the lesser spell is immediately extinguished.

Sometimes the effects of *perpetual**illumination*and *perpetual**tenebrosity*may come into conflict. If so, the level of the respective spellcasters determines the result. If the caster of *perpetual**illumination* is 3 or more caster levels higher than the caster of*perpetual**tenebrosity*, then the *perpetual**tenebrosity* is suppressed within the *perpetual*area. If the caster of *perpetual**tenebrosity* is 3 or more caster levels higher, then the *perpetual**illumination* is suppressed within the *illuminated*area. In any other case, both spells are suppressed, restoring the existing ambient light level.

###### Illusory Duplicates

Arcane 2 Type: illusion

Range: self Duration: 6 turns

This spell creates 1d4 *illusory duplicates* of the caster. Once created, the duplicates separate from the caster and cluster around him. Thereafter, the duplicates move through each other as well as the real caster more or less constantly, making it impossible for most creatures to determine which is real. The duplicates mimic the caster’s actions, pretending to cast spells, drink potions, levitate, and so on, just as the caster does. The duplicates always look exactly like the caster at every moment.

Enemies attempting to attack or cast spells upon the caster will always hit a duplicate instead. Any attack against a duplicate destroys it, whether the attack throw is successful or not; likewise, attack spells cast directly upon a duplicate will destroy it, with no saving throw allowed. Area-effect spells are not cast directly on the caster, and thus appear to affect all duplicates exactly as they affect the caster; for instance, if the caster is subjected to a *fireball*, all his duplicates will appear to be injured just as the caster was. Sweep attacks against the caster must target all of the remaining duplicates, treating each as a separate target.

###### Illusory Figment

Arcane 1 Type: illusion

Range: 30’Duration: concentration + 1 round

This spell creates an audiovisual illusion of an area, object, creature, or force, as visualized by the caster, up to a maximum size of 1’ x 1’ x 1’. The illusion does not create smell, texture, or temperature. The caster can move the figment within the limits of the size of the effect. The figment persists so long as the caster maintains concentration.

A creature who encounters an *illusory* *figment* and has reason to be suspicious about its reality can make a Spells saving throw to disbelieve it at the start of its initiative. The creature gains a +4 bonus if the area, object, creature, or force being simulated should have smell, texture, or temperature, provided the creature can tell the figment does not have those qualities. If the save succeeds, the creature confirms the *illusory**figment* is an illusion and can see anything the figment is concealing. If the save fails, the creature continues to believe it is real. The creature cannot attempt to disbelieve the *illusory**figment*again until it has further evidence of its illusory nature (e.g. a friend tells him “it’s an illusion,” he discovers it has no texture where there should be, etc.)

###### Illusory Interior

Arcane 2 Type: illusion

Range: 10’/caster levelDuration: perpetual

This spell creates an illusion of interior decorations and furnishings. The illusion is strictly visual and does not encompass outdoor environments or living creatures. The entirety of the *illusory**interior*must be within range of the spell and fit within a 10’ x 10’ x 10’ cube. (Multiple castings of *illusory**interior* can be used to cover larger areas.) Since the interior décor created by this spell will not smell, sound, or feel as it should, creatures that interact with the *illusory**interior*always receive a Spells saving throw to disbelieve it. If the save succeeds, the creature confirms the interior is an illusion and can see any creatures or objects the *illusory**interior* is concealing. If the save fails, the creature continues to believe it is real. Subject to these limitations, the spell is useful for, e.g., concealing a door with an illusory wall, hiding a pit beneath an illusory carpet, presenting mundane furnishings as luxurious works of art, disguising a pile of coins as a hay pile, and so on. An *illusory**interior* is perpetual, lasting until dispelled or the caster dies or decides to stop sustaining it.

###### Illusory Terrain

Arcane 4 , Divine 6 Type: illusion

Range: specialDuration: special

This spell makes a structure or terrain feature appear as a different type of structure or feature (e.g. field into forest, grassland into desert, hill into a castle, etc.). *Illusory**terrain*requires a full turn to cast, during which time the caster must be in or on the structure or terrain feature to be affected. The structure or feature to be affected must fit within a 480’ diameter sphere. (Multiple castings of *illusory**terrain*can be used to cover larger structures or features.)

Once the spell is cast, the *illusory**terrain* looks, sounds, smells, and feels exactly like the type of feature that the caster has selected. The spell expires immediately if a sapient creature moves into the *illusory**terrain*. (The caster can move out of the terrain after casting the spell without causing it to be expire.) Mindless or bestial creatures do not cause the spell to expire, and instead simply vanish from sight when they enter the *illusory**terrain*.

A creature who encounters *illusory**terrain* and has reason to be suspicious about its reality can make a Spells saving throw to disbelieve it at the start of its initiative. If the save succeeds, the creature confirms the *terrain* is an illusion and can see, hear, smell, touch, and feel anything it is concealing. If the save fails, the creature continues to believe it is real. The creature cannot attempt to disbelieve the *illusory terrain*again until it has further evidence of its illusory nature (e.g. a friend tells him “it’s an illusion,” he sees a deer wander into “the lake” and vanish, etc.)

###### Inaudibility

Arcane 3 , Divine 4 Type: illusion

Range: touchDuration: 1 day

This spell grants the recipient the ability to move and fight noiselessly. It counts as **sneaking** until the effect ends. Should the recipient carry or pick up any items, these items also become noiseless so long as they remain in the creature’s possession. For instance, a bell carried by the recipient would not toll, and a bag of coins would not jingle. Conversely, any items leaving the recipient’s possession regain their normal audibility if fired, dropped or put down. The spell ends if the recipient speaks, suffers damage, fails a saving throw, or casts a spell. Merely attacking or interacting with objects does not end the effect. The spell lasts at most 1 day.

###### Incite Madness

Arcane 3 Type: enchantment

Range: 90’ Duration: perpetual

This spell can afflict a living humanoid creature in range with a terrible madness. The target must make a Spells saving throw. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect. If the save fails, the target becomes**mad**. A mad creature rolls 2d6 on the following table on its initiative number each round to determine its actions:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| 2d6 | Behavior |
| 2–5 | Attack the caster or allies with melee or ranged weapons (or move closer if attack is not possible). |
| 6–8 | Do nothing but babble incoherently. |
| 9–12 | Attack the creature’s own party, if any. |

Attackers are not at any special advantage when attacking the mad creature. A mad creature who is attacked automatically retaliates on its next initiative, as long as it is still mad at the start of its initiative. A mad creature which is restrained, imprisoned, alone, or otherwise can’t carry out the indicated action does nothing but babble incoherently. The duration is perpetual, so the madness lasts until the spell is **dispelled** or extinguished by *remove curse*or until the caster dies or decides to stop sustaining the effect.

###### Indiscernibility

Arcane 4 , Divine 4 Type: esoteric, protection

Range: touchDuration: 1 day

This spell protects the recipient touched from being spied on by any type of *locate*or *scrying*spell. The spell’s magical protection also prevents *locating* or *scrying* on the items the recipient is wearing and on his present location. The caster attempting to *scry* upon the recipient, item, or location will learn it is being magically protected, but will not gain any other information. If the recipient himself can cast *scry*, he still has a chance to notice the attempt, even though he is protected from the spell (see p. XX).

In addition, *indiscernibility* also allows the recipient to automatically refuse a telepathic link froma caster using *telepathy*. The caster attempting to contact the recipient will know the recipient is magically protected.

###### Inferno

Arcane 4 Type: blast, elemental (fire)

Range: 225’Duration: 1 round/caster level

This spell conjures a terrible *inferno* from the Sphere of Elemental Fire itself centered on a target point. The *inferno*is 30’ in diameter and 10’ high and burns everything within. It deals 1d10 extraordinary fire damage each round to creatures that begin their initiative in or enter its area of effect (no saving throw).

The*inferno* can also damage structures in its area of effect. It deals up to 1d10 x 3 extraordinary fire structural damage to wooden structures and 1d10 extraordinary fire structural damage to stone structures on the caster’s initiative number each round. (It might deal less if the structure is not entirely in its area of effect.) The*inferno*causes combustibles (such as military oil or petards) to ignite. The *inferno*lasts until **dispelled** or the spell’s duration expires.

###### Infuriate Beast

Divine 1 Type: enchantment

Range: 360’Duration: 1 turn

This spell can enrage a living animal target with fewer than 9 HD. The target must make a Spells saving throw. If the save fails, the target becomes **infuriated**.

Each round, an infuriated creature will attack any creatures it can detect. It will prioritize attacking whichever creature has most recently damaged it, but otherwise will attack the closest target. If the infuriated creature has no eligible targets, it will wait motionless in seething fury until a target presents itself. An infuriated creature gains a +2 bonus to its attack throws but suffers a -2 penalty to its AC due to its mindless rage. It cannot talk or retreat. It is immune to fear and ignores morale. The creature remains infuriated until the spell ends or the effect is **dispelled** or removed by *remove fear*. However, if an infuriated female creature ever finds itself about to attack its own mate or offspring, the creature may immediately make an additional saving throw at +5, with a successful save ending the effect.

###### Infuriate Humanoid

Arcane 1 Type: enchantment

Range: 360’Duration: 1 turn

This spell can enrage a living humanoid target with fewer than 5 HD. The target must make a Spells saving throw. If the save fails, the target becomes **infuriated**. The effect is identical to that of *infuriate beast*, above.

###### Infuriate Crowd

Arcane 3 Type: enchantment

Range: 360’Duration: 1 turn

This spell can enrage any living humanoid targets with fewer than 5 HD situated within a 20’ diameter sphere centered on a target point. Each target in the sphere must make a Spells saving throw. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect. If the save fails, the target is **infuriated**. The effect is identical to that of *infuriate**beast*, above.

###### Inspire Awe\*

Divine 4 Type: enchantment

Range: self Duration: 3 turns

This spell can inspire awe and dread in the hearts of the wicked. The means by which this occurs will depend on the caster’s spell signature. Each evil creature that begins its initiative or moves within 30’ of the caster must make a Spells saving throw. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect on that creature that round. If the save fails, the creature **falters** that round. A **faltering** creature suffers a -2 penalty to attack throws, proficiency throws, and saving throws against the caster.

For purposes of this spell, evil creatures include hostile creatures of an alignment other than the caster’s alignment, and inherently evil creatures such as undead, or incarnations or enchanted creatures of Chaotic alignment. It can affect incarnations and undead even if these creatures are ordinarily immune to enchantment effects.

The reverse of this spell, *inspire**horror*, can cause fear and terror in the hearts of the kind, targeting good creatures rather than evil. For purposes of this spell, good creatures include hostile creatures of an alignment other than the caster’s alignment, and inherently good creatures such as incarnations or enchanted creatures of Lawful alignment.

###### Invisibility

Arcane 3 , Divine 4 Type: illusion

Range: touchDuration: 1 day

The spell causes the recipient creature or object to become invisible to ordinary sight and even **lightless vision**. An *invisible* creature can still see itself. Otherwise, not even the caster can see the recipient without the aid of *discern**invisible* or *true**seeing*. The recipient can still be heard unless it is *inaudible***,** *noiseless*, or moving silently. An invisible creature counts as **hidden** to all creatures unable to see until the spell ends.

If the recipient of the spell is a creature that is carrying and/or wearing items, the recipient’s carried and/or worn items vanish as well. However, any part of any item that the recipient carries that extends more than 10’ from it is visible. If the recipient drops or sets down invisible items it is carrying, the items immediately become visible. Conversely, if the recipient picks up a visible item and tucks into his clothing or containers, the item becomes invisible. Light never becomes invisible, although a source of light can become so, thus creating the effect of a visible light with no visible source. If the recipient of the spell is dusted with substances such as flour or powder, its dusted form remains visible until the end of its next initiative.

If the recipient casts a spell or attacks a creature, the spell expires at the end of the recipient’s initiative (i.e. after the attack is made or spell is cast). Attacking an unattended stationary object, or cleverly causing a creature harm indirectly, does not cause the spell to expire. The spell lasts at most 1 day.

###### Invulnerability to Evil\*

Divine 3 Type: protection

Range: selfDuration: 1 turn

This spell makes the caster **immune** to mundane damage dealt by evil creatures with melee or missile attacks. Attacks made by evil creatures with silver weapons are considered to deal extraordinary damage for purposes of this spell. Evil creatures include hostile creatures of an alignment other than the caster’s alignment, and inherently evil creatures such as undead, or incarnations or enchanted creatures of Chaotic alignment.

Reversed, this spell becomes *invulnerability to good* and protects the caster from hostile creatures of an alignment other than the caster’s, and from inherently good creatures such as incarnations or enchanted creatures of Lawful alignment.

###### Iron Maiden

Arcane 4 Type: death

Range: 120’Duration: special

This spell creates an invisible crushing vise around the entire body of the target creature. The target must make a Death saving throw. If the save succeeds, the target breaks out of the *iron maiden*; it suffers 1d6 extraordinary bludgeoning damage but the spell ends. If the save fails, the target is imprisoned by the *iron**maiden*. It suffers 1d12 extraordinary bludgeoning damage and is held **helpless** by the spell.

When helpless, a creature cannot attack, cast spells, or move. A helpless creature gains no benefit to its AC from its DEX or shield (if any). A helpless creature can be ambushed or backstabbed by creatures capable of doing so. All attack throws against helpless creatures gain a +2 bonus, or a +4 bonus if the attacker ambushes or backstabs the helpless creature. The helpless creature is dealt the attack’s ordinary damage, or the attack’s ordinary damage multiplied by two or more from ambush or backstab. Melee attack throws against helpless creatures automatically hit if the attacker is of the same or larger size category than the helpless creature. If the attacker is not **engaged**, and his attack is capable of damaging the helpless creature, then the helpless creature may be automatically slain. The attacker cannot cleave thereafter, however. Otherwise, the helpless creature may be dealt the attack’s ordinary damage.

When the caster’s next initiative number comes up, if the caster maintains concentration on the spell, then the imprisoned target must make another saving throw. If the save succeeds, the target breaks out (suffering 1d6 extraordinary bludgeoning damage) and ends the spell. If the save fails, the target continues to be imprisoned (suffering 1d12 extraordinary bludgeoning damage and remaining helpless). The *iron maiden*lasts until dispelled,the caster stops concentrating upon it, or the target dies or makes a successful saving throw and breaks out.

###### Kindle Flame\*

Arcane 1, Divine 1 Type: blast, elemental (fire)

Range: 15’Duration: instantaneous

This spell can cause one or more target objects to burst into flame. The target objects can be wet but must be readily flammable. Readily flammable objects include bits of kindling, sticks of wood, clothing, hair, and cloth, but not flesh. All of the target objects must be within a single 5’ diameter sphere. The caster can select which objects within the spell’s area of effect are ignited. In most cases this spell is used to light campfires in adverse weather, etc.

If the spell is used to set a creature’s clothes or hair on fire, or otherwise to cause harm to a creature, the affected creature must make a Blast saving throw. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect. If the save fails, the creature begins **burning.** Burning creatures suffer 1d8 fire damage at the start of their initiative each round until the flames go out. It takes one full round of rolling on the ground or being immersed in water to extinguish the flames. Unless the object ignited is quite large, the flames burn out naturally in 1d4+1 rounds.

The reverse of this spell, *quench flame*, instantly extinguishes the fire on one or more objects within range. All of the affected objects must be within a single 5’ diameter sphere.

###### Lay of the Land

Arcane 5, Divine 5 Type: detection

Range: 3 milesDuration: concentration

This spell can magically reveal the existence of lairs within 3 miles (i.e. within the area of a 6-mile hex). The Judge should make a Searching proficiency throw on behalf of the caster after three turns (30 minutes) of concentration. The target value for the throw is 4+, or 2+ if the caster has Land Surveying proficiency. If the throw fails, the spell immediately ends. If the throw succeeds, the caster learns the direction and approximate distance to the nearest unrevealed lair and can continue searching with the spell for other lairs. The throw automatically fails if there are no lairs in range, or if all lairs within range have been revealed by the spell. Because the roll is made in secret by the Judge, the caster cannot be certain whether the spell has ended because of chance or because there are no more lairs to find.

###### Leaping

Arcane 1 Type: transmogrification

Range: touchDuration: 3 turns

This spell grants the recipient the ability to leap in great bounds. The recipient can leap 10’ vertically and 30’ horizontally from a standing start. This prodigious jumping ability grants the recipient a +8 bonus on Acrobatics throws. Because of his light step, the recipient needs no rest if engaged in ordinary movement. The recipient must be man-sized or smaller when this spell is cast or it fails to work.

###### Level Water

Arcane 6, Divine 6 Type: elemental (water), esoteric, movement

Range: 360’ Duration: 10 turns

This powerful spell can be cast in several different ways, depending on the caster’s purpose:

* If cast on a target body of water, it reduces the water’s depth by up to 2’ per caster level (to a minimum depth of 1 inch). The water depth is lowered within a more or less square-shaped depression whose sides are up to 10’ long per caster level.
* If cast on a point of deep and open ocean, it creates a whirlpool with a diameter of 10’ per caster level and a depth of 2’ per caster level. See Nautical Hazards (p. XX) for the effects of whirlpools.
* If cast on a water elemental, marid, or other creature from the elemental sphere of water, it functions as a *halt monster* spell.

###### Levitation

Arcane 2 Type: movement

Range: 180’ Duration: 3 turns

This spell allows the caster to move a recipient creature or object of up to a specified weight vertically through the air within range. (If the caster is the recipient, the range is measured from his location when he casts the spell.) The caster can levitate up to 6 stone per caster level. A creature must be willing to be levitated. A levitating creature can carry its normal load (possibly including another creature), but the extra weight counts against the caster’s maximum weight. An object must be unattended or possessed by a willing creature.

In order to move the recipient, the caster must concentrate. The concentrating caster can move the recipient up to 20’ up or down each round on the caster’s initiative. The caster does not need to maintain concentration to sustain the spell. For instance, he can concentrate for one round to move the recipient 20’ up, take another action the following round, and then resume moving the recipient the subsequent round. The caster can change the target of *levitation* on each round that he concentrates, if desired.

The caster cannot move the recipient horizontally. However, if the recipient is a creature, it can still move by, e.g. clambering along the face of a cliff or pushing against a ceiling to move laterally, doing so at half its ordinary speed.

A levitating creature that makes an attack throw is penalized due to its instability, and becomes increasingly unstable as it continues to attack. The first attack throw has a -1 attack penalty, the second a -2 penalty, and so on, to a maximum penalty of -5. If the caster spends a full round concentrating on stabilizing the creature, the penalty is reduced back to -1. (A concentrating caster can thus maintain a levitating archer at a -1 penalty from round to round.) A levitating creature can cast spells or use items or special abilities that do not require an attack throw without any penalty.

If the recipient is up in the air, and either the duration expires, the spell is **dispelled**, the affected creature or object is loaded beyond what the caster can telekinetically support, or the caster begins concentrating on a new target, the recipientwill immediately plummet from the air.

###### Life Transfer

Arcane 5 Type: death

Range: 120’Duration: concentration (1 round/level)

This spell transfers the life force from one living creature in range (the victim) to another living creature in range (the beneficiary). When the spell is cast, the victim must make a Spells saving throw. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect. If the save fails, the life transfer begins. At the end of the caster’s initiative each round, starting on the round he cast the spell, the victim suffers 1d6+1 necrotic damage while the beneficiary is healed an equal amount of damage. The victim can be drained until its hp are reduced to a negative value equal in magnitude to its maximum hp. The life transfer continues until the victim can no longer be drained, the effect is **dispelled**, the caster loses concentration, or one round per caster level elapses.

###### Lightless Vision

Arcane 3 , Divine 4 Type: transmogrification

Range: touchDuration: 1 day

This spell grants the recipient the ability to see as if he were carrying a light source that sheds dim light in a 60’ radius. *Lightless vision* does not enable the recipient to discern colors or to read books, maps, or scrolls, so the recipient might still need a light source for some tasks. The recipient must be man-sized or smaller when this spell is cast or it fails to work.

###### Lightless Vision, Mass

Arcane 5 Type: transmogrification

Range: touchDuration: 1 day

This spell grants the recipient the ability to see as if he were carrying a light source that sheds dim light in a 60’ radius. *Lightless vision* does not enable the recipient to discern colors or to read books, maps, or scrolls, so the recipient might still need a light source for some tasks. The spell can affect one recipient, plus one additional recipient per two caster levels beyond 1st. *Mass lightless vision*will therefore affect five recipients at 9th level, six recipients at 11th level, and seven recipients at 13th level. Each recipient must be man-sized or smaller when this spell is cast or it fails to work on that recipient.

###### Lightning Strike

Arcane 3, Divine 3 Type: blast, elemental (air), esoteric

Range: 480’ Duration: 1 turn / caster level

This spell can only be cast when a thunderstorm is within range. (If one is not present, of course, a high-level caster can summon one using *summon weather*). Once the spell is cast, the caster can thereafter call down one *lightning**strike* per turn (10 minutes). Calling down a *strike* counts as casting a spell, so the caster must remain stationary, take no other action, and avoid being interrupted on the round he calls down the *lightning**strike*. (If the caster gets interrupted, the *lightning strike* does not arrive, but it does not count as his use for that turn; he can try again the next round.)

Once called, the *lightning strike* streaks down from the sky to hit an area 20’ in diameter centered on a target point. Each creature within the area of effect must make a Blast saving throw. If the save fails, the creature take 1d6 extraordinary electric damage per caster level (maximum 8d6). If the save succeeds, the creature takes half that damage.

The*lightning**strike* can also damage structures in its area of effect. It deals up to 1d6 extraordinary electric structural damage per caster level to wooden structures and one-third that damage to stone structures. (It might deal less if the structure is not entirely in its area of effect.)

If the caster calls the lightning strike on a point that is underground or inside structure, the lightning will strike the ceiling or surface above the target point. If the damage caused to an interposing structure shatters or breaks through it, the *lightning**strike*will continue beyond the barrier in order to attain its full volume.

The caster does not have to make a *lightning**strike* every turn but cannot accumulate them, either. *Lighting**strikes* remain available until either the spell duration or the storm ends.

###### Locate Animal or Plant

Divine 1 Type: detection

Range: 180’Duration: 6 turns

This spell reveals the direction and approximate distance to the closest specimen of a particular type of animal or plant within range. The spellcaster must name the specific type of animal or plant he wishes to locate. If no specimens of the desired type of animal or plant are within range, the caster senses nothing. If a specimen comes into range later in the duration of the spell, either because the caster moved or the specimen did, the caster will learn the direction and distance at that time. A *locate**animal or plant* spell is not blocked by earth, stone, or wood, but can be blocked by even a thin sheet of lead or gold (in which case the caster also senses nothing). The spell will locate normal or giant-sized animals, but not intelligent creatures, monstrosities such as owlbeasts or wyverns, or oozes. The animal or plant gets no saving throw. This spell is most often used to find special rare plants; a character using this spell receives a +4 bonus on Naturalism proficiency throws to locate poisonous plants.

###### Locate Distant Object

Arcane 6 Type: detection

Range: 1,200 milesDuration: concentration

This spell allows the caster to sense the direction and approximate distance to a familiar or clearly envisioned object, even over vast ranges (up to 1,200 miles or 50 24-mile hexes). He can search for general items, in which case he senses the direction and distance to the nearest one of its kind. Alternatively the caster can search for a unique item that he has observed firsthand (not through divination). If the item sought is not within range, the casters learns that instead. If the object comes into range later in the duration of the spell, either because the caster moved or the object did, the caster will learn the direction and distance at that time. A *locate**distant object* spell is not blocked by earth, stone, or wood, but can be blocked by even a thin sheet of lead or gold (in which case the caster also senses nothing). Creatures cannot be located with this spell, except indirectly (e.g. a particular item worn by a creature might reveal its location).

###### Locate Haunting

Arcane 5, Divine 5 Type: detection

Range: 12 miles Duration: concentration

This spell allows the caster to sense the direction and approximate distance to the nearest undead creatures within 12 miles (i.e. within the area of a 24-mile hex). The caster can search for undead in general, in which case the spell will reveal the type of, as well as direction and approximate distance to, the nearest undead of any sort. Alternatively, the caster can locate a particular undead creature (e.g. “the mummy Amon-Hotep”) that he either can identify by its true name or has physically encountered in the past. If the creature sought is not within range, the caster senses nothing. If the target comes into range later in the duration of the spell, either because the caster moved or the undead did, the caster will learn the direction and distance at that time. A *locate haunting* spell is not blocked by earth, stone, or wood, but can be blocked by even a thin sheet of lead or gold (in which case the caster also senses nothing).

###### Locate Object

Arcane 2 Type: detection

Range: 180’ Duration: 6 turns

This spell allows the caster to sense the direction and approximate distance to a familiar or clearly envisioned object within range. He can search for general items, in which case he senses the direction and distance to the nearest one of its kind. Alternatively the caster can search for a unique item that he has observed firsthand (not through divination). If the item sought is not within range, the casters senses nothing. If the object comes into range later in the duration of the spell, either because the caster moved or the object did, the caster will learn the direction and distance at that time. A *locate**object* spell is not blocked by earth, stone, or wood, but can be blocked by even a thin sheet of lead or gold (in which case the caster also senses nothing). Creatures cannot be located with this spell, except indirectly (e.g. a particular item worn by a creature might reveal its location).

###### Locate Place of Power

Arcane 6, Divine 6 Type: detection

Range: 12 miles Duration: concentration

This spell allows the caster to sense the direction and approximate distance to the most potent place of power within 12 miles (i.e. within the area of a 24-mile hex). The caster can search for places of power in general, in which case the spell will reveal the type of place it detects as well as direction and distance. Alternatively, he can specify a particular type of place (e.g. “sinkholes of evil”), in which case the spell will reveal the direction and distance to the most potent place of that type. If that type of place of power is not within range, the caster senses nothing. If the place of powers comes into range later in the duration of the spell, the caster will learn the direction and distance at that time. . *Locate**place**of**power* is not blocked by earth, stone, or wood, but can be blocked by even a thin sheet of lead or gold (in which case the caster also senses nothing). *Locate**place**of**power*is a complex spell that requires 1 turn (10 minutes) to cast.

###### Locate Treasure

Arcane 4 Type: detection

Range: 540’Duration: 3 turns

This spell allows the caster to sense the direction and approximate distance to a treasure hoard within 540’. For purposes of this spell, a treasure hoard is a collection of copper, silver, gold, platinum, and gems within a 10’ x 10’ area worth at least 50gp in total. If there are several treasure hoards in range, the caster senses the direction and distance to the most valuable one. If there are no treasure hoards in range, the caster senses nothing. If treasure comes into range later in the duration of the spell, the caster will learn the direction and distance at that time. *Locate treasure* is not blocked by earth, stone, or wood, but can be blocked by even a thin sheet of lead or gold (in which case the caster also senses nothing).

###### Madness of Crowds

Arcane 6 Type: enchantment

Range: 240’ Duration: 1 turn

This spell can drive mad any living humanoid targets with fewer than 5 HD situated within a 60’ diameter sphere centered on a target point. Each target of 2HD or more in the area of effect must make a Spells saving throw. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect. If the save fails, or the target has fewer than 2 HD, the target becomes **mad**. A mad creature rolls 2d6 on the following table on its initiative number each round to determine its actions:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| 2d6 | Behavior |
| 2–5 | Attack the caster or allies with melee or ranged weapons (or move closer if attack is not possible). |
| 6–8 | Do nothing but babble incoherently. |
| 9–12 | Attack the creature’s own party, if any. |

Attackers are not at any special advantage when attacking mad creatures. A mad creature which is attacked automatically retaliates on its next initiative, as long as it is still mad at the start of its initiative. A mad creature which is restrained, imprisoned, alone, or otherwise can’t carry out the indicated action does nothing but babble incoherently. The effects last until the spell expires or until they are **dispelled** or extinguished by *remove curse*.

###### Mage Missile

Arcane 1 Type: blast, elemental (any)

Range: 360’Duration: concentration

This spell enables the caster to fire bolts of arcane energy. On the round this spell is cast, and on each round thereafter that the caster maintains concentration, the caster can fire one *mage missile*at a target. The caster does not have to make an attack throw to hit the target, and the target receives no saving throw. The *mage missile*deals 1d4 extraordinary arcane damage when it strikes.

###### Magic Carpet

Arcane 4 Type: movement

Range: touch Duration: 1 turn/caster level

This spell transforms a target carpet, rug, tapestry, or other woven object into a flying vehicle. The target object must be at least 4’ x 6’ in size, and can be up to 10’ x 15’.

Once enchanted, the *magic carpet*can be steered through the air by the caster on his initiative. Steering the *magic carpet* is easier than riding a horse, and does not require Driving or Riding proficiency. If no passenger is carried, or only one man-sized passenger, the carpet can move with an encounter speed of 300’ per turn. If two or three man-sized passengers are carried, the carpet can move with an encounter speed of 240’ and 180’ per turn, respectively. No more than three man-sized creatures, or a total of 60 stone, can be carried on the *magic carpet*. The *magic carpet* can hover in place at any altitude.

The caster cannot cast spells while the *magic carpet* is moving, but can cast spells if the magic carpet is hovering. Passengers capable of casting spells can do so from the *magic carpet* provided they remain stationary on the carpet. The *magic carpet* is immune to area of effect attacks or spells but creatures on the carpet are affected by them normally. If a creature on the carpet takes bludgeoning or seismic damage, it must make a Paralysis saving throw. If the save fails, the creature falls off the carpet. If the save succeeds, the creature remains stationary on the carpet. If the *magic carpet* is itself the target of an attack, treat it as having an AC of 0 and a number of hit points equal to the caster’s. When the duration expires, or if the magic carpet is ever **dispelled** or destroyed, or starts carrying more than four man-sized creatures or 60 stone, the *magic carpet* will plummet from the air.

###### Magic Lock

Arcane 2 , Divine 2 Type: esoteric, movement

Range: 10’Duration: perpetual

This spell magically locks a target chest, door, gate, portcullis, shutter, window, or other portal. Once cast, the *magic lock* is perpetual. The caster can freely open and close the *magic lock*without affecting the spell, as can any arcane spellcaster 3 or more levels higher than the caster of the *magic lock*.Otherwise, a portal secured with this spell can be opened only by breaking into it or by **dispelling** the *magic lock*.

###### Mirage

Arcane 5 Type: illusion

Range: specialDuration: perpetual

This spell makes a structure or terrain feature appear as another structure or feature (e.g. a tower into a hill, a swamp into a lake, a grove of trees into a stand of minarets, etc.) *Mirage* requires a full turn to cast, during which time the caster must be in or on the structure or terrain feature to be affected. The structure or feature to be affected must fit within a 480’ diameter sphere. (Multiple castings of *mirage*can be used to cover larger structures or features.) Once the spell is cast, the affected structure or terrain looks, sounds, smells, and feels exactly like its illusionary form. The *mirage* is perpetual, lasting until dispelled or until the caster dies or decides to stop sustaining it.Because of its huge area of effect and long duration,*mirage* is frequently used by spellcasters to conceal their sanctums and by elf-lords to hide their fastnesses.

A creature who encounters a *mirage* and has reason to be suspicious about its reality can make a Spells saving throw to disbelieve it at the start of its initiative. If the save succeeds, the creature confirms the *mirage* is an illusion and can see, hear, smell, touch, and feel anything it is concealing. If the save fails, the creature continues to believe it is real. The creature cannot attempt to disbelieve the *mirage*again until it has further evidence of its illusory nature (e.g. a friend tells him “it’s an illusion,” he sees elves walking into hills and vanishing, etc.)

###### Necromantic Invulnerability

Arcane 6 Type: necromancy

Range: selfDuration: 1 hour/caster level

This spell makes the caster preternaturally difficult to kill. Suffused with necromantic energies, the caster could have his lung pierced, his throat cut, his arms cut off, or his skull bashed in, and still not die! In game terms, anytime the caster is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, the caster gets to immediately roll 1d20+1d6 on the Mortal Wounds table. Apply the usual modifiers for Hit points and Constitution, but instead of the modifiers for Treatment and Timing applies his caster level as a bonus. Record the result of any permanent wounds as usual. However, regardless of any permanent wound, the caster is then immediately restored to 1 hp without need for bed rest. A character protected by *necromantic**invulnerability* can only be actually killed if he is slain while helpless by an unengaged combatant, or if he is **disintegrated** or slain by necrotic damage.

EXAMPLE: Ra-Ramses is an 11th level mage with 31 hp and CON 11. He casts *necromantic**invulnerability*on himself. A few hours later, he is caught in a 39 damage *thunderbolt*casts by his rival, Quintus, and reduced to -8 hp. Ra-Ramses immediately rolls 1d20+1d6 on the Mortal Wounds table. His d20 roll is a lowly 2 but his d6 roll is a 5. There is no modifier from his CON of 11. There is a -2 penalty because his hp are at a negative value greater than one quarter but less than half his maximum hp. In lieu of any Treatment or Timing modifiers, he adds a bonus equal to his caster level, or +11. His final d20 result is therefore (2-2+11) or 11. A result of 11, 2 on the Mortal Wounds table means that Ra-Ramses has had an eye damaged. However, he is not critically wounded nor does he need one week’s bed rest; instead he immediately is restored to 1 hp. Quintus watches in horror as Ra-Ramses sits up and brushes himself off, the only apparent effect of the lightning blast being a filmy cataract on one eye.

###### Necromantic Potence

Arcane 2 , Divine 2 Type: necromancy

Range: selfDuration: 1 hour/caster level

This spell imbues the caster with powerful necromantic energies, granting him 1d10 temporary hit points + 1 hp per caster level. These temporary hit points will be the first lost if any damage is suffered, but cannot be regained through rest or healing magic, and will disappear at the expiration of the spell’s duration. While *necromantic**potence*is in effect, the spellcaster is treated as an inherently evil summoned creature for purposes of *discern**evil*and *holy circle*. A successful *counterspell, dispel magic,* or *dispel**evil* spell will strip the caster of his temporary hit points.

###### Neutralize Poison\*

Divine 4 Type: healing

Range: touchDuration: instantaneous

This spell detoxifies any sort of poison in the creature or object touched. If cast upon a creature slain by poison within the last turn (10 minutes), the creature is revived with 1 hit point. If cast upon a poisonous object (such as a weapon, trap, etc.) the poison is rendered permanently ineffective.

Reversed, this spell becomes *poison*. The caster must make an attack throw to touch the target. If the attack succeeds, the target receives a Death saving throw. If the save fails, the target dies. The caster’s touch remains poisonous for 1 round per level of ability, or until discharged (i.e. only one creature can be affected by the reversed spell).

###### Noiselessness

Divine 2 Type: illusion

Range: selfDuration: concentration + 1 round

This spell creates a sphere of complete silence in a 10’ radius around the caster. All sound is stopped: Conversation is impossible, spells cannot be cast, and no noise whatsoever issues from, enters, or passes through the area. All creatures within the radius are **deafened** and **sneaking**. The spell lasts while the caster maintains concentration plus 1 additional round thereafter. The spell immediately ends if the caster speaks.

###### Ogre Strength

Arcane 2 Type: transmogrification

Range: touchDuration: 3 turns

This spell grants the recipient the strength he would possess were he an ogre of equal fitness and musculature. For the duration of the spell, the character gains an additional +2 bonus to melee attack throws and melee damage rolls and an additional +8 bonus on Dungeonbashing throws. In addition, the character gains the ability to strike barehanded for 1d4 bludgeoning damage, and to carry an extra 10 stone at his maximum load. The recipient must be man-sized or smaller when this spell is cast or it fails to work. This spell does not otherwise stack with effects that influence strength or size, but it does stack with the character’s normal bonus or penalty from Strength.

###### Panic

Arcane 6 Type: enchantment

Range: 360’Duration: concentration

This spell produces a 60’ diameter sphere of fear centered on a target point. Each living creature with fewer than 5 HD within the sphere must make a Paralysis saving throw. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect on that creature. If the save fails, the creature becomes **frightened** for as long as the caster maintains stationary concentration, until the affected creatures leaves range of the caster, or until the effect is **dispelled** normallyor by*remove fear*.

A **frightened** creature cannot attack, cast spells, or speak (except to scream in stark terror). A **frightened** creature will run from the source of its fear at its full speed. If a **frightened** creature cannot flee, it cowers in terror. An **engaged** creature that is **frightened** will cower in terror until it is able to disengage with defensive movement. It suffers a -2 penalty to AC and cannot attack, cast spells, move, or take any other actions until the condition ends.

###### Passageway

Arcane 6 Type: esoteric, wall

Range: 30’ Duration: 6 turns

This spell creates a *passageway* through concrete, plaster, stone, or wood walls, but not through walls made of metal or other harder materials. The *passageway* can be up to 10’ wide and up to 30’ deep. The entire *passageway* must be in range of the spell. If the wall’s thickness is more than the depth of the passage created, then a single *passageway* simply makes a niche or short tunnel. Several *passageway* spells can then form a continuing passage to breach very thick walls. When *passageway* ends (due to duration, **dispelling**, or caster’s choice), the passageway instantly closes. Any creatures within the passage are ejected out the nearest exit.

###### Pass Without Trace

Divine 1 Type: transmogrification

Range: touchDuration: 1 turn/caster level

This spell grants the recipient with the ability to magically conceal his tracks while traveling through the wilderness, possibly along with one or more traveling companions. For the duration of the spell, the recipient gains the benefit of the Passing Without Trace proficiency. Use the caster level rather than the recipient’s level to determine how many additional tracks the recipient can conceal. If the recipient already has the Passing Without Trace proficiency, add his class level to the caster level for this purpose. The recipient and his traveling companion’s steps are veritably traceless, with not even mud or snow revealing their tracks. However, a *discern* *magic*or *true seeing*spell cast within three turns of the recipient’s passage will reveal the tracks. The recipient must be man-sized or smaller when this spell is cast or it fails to work.

###### Perpetual Figment

Arcane 6 Type: illusion

Range: 360’Duration: perpetual

This spell creates a perpetual multi-sensory illusion of an area, object, creature, or force, as visualized by the caster, up to a maximum size of 40’ x 40’ x 40’. The illusion includes visual, auditory, olfactory, and thermal components. The illusion can be static (e.g. a wall) or dynamic (e.g. a crackling fire or a dragon circling overhead). If dynamic, the illusion will not be interactive in any way, and the sequence cannot be longer than 1 round per level of the caster. The *perpetual figment’s* sequence will continuously loop. The illusion will last until **dispelled** or until the caster dies or decides to stop sustaining it.

If used to create the illusion of one or more creatures, the illusory creatures have AC 0 and 1 hp; they immediately disappear if hit in combat. If used to simulate an attack spell or an attacking creature, the illusory attack and damage done should be resolved by the Judge as if it were real. However, any creature affected by illusory damage receives a Spells saving throw to disbelieve the illusion. If the save succeeds, the creature takes no damage and realizes the *perpetual**figment* is an illusion. If the save fails, the creature believes it has been damaged, possibly fainting into unconsciousness if it believes its hit points have been reduced to 0 or fewer. However, the illusory damage is not real. A “killed” or “injured” creature realizes it is unharmed at the end of its initiative in 1d6 rounds, and thereafter knows the *permanent**figment*is an illusion.

A creature who encounters a *perpetual**figment* and has reason to be suspicious about its reality can make a Spells saving throw to disbelieve it at the start of its initiative. If the save succeeds, the creature confirms the *perpetual**figment* is an illusion and can see, hear, smell, touch, and feel anything it is concealing. If the save fails, the creature continues to believe it is real. The creature cannot attempt to disbelieve the *perpetual**figment*again until it has further evidence of its illusory nature (e.g. a friend tells him “it’s an illusion,” he notices that the illusion is looping every round, etc.)

###### Petrification\*

Arcane 6 Type: death

Range: 180’Duration: instantaneous

This spell can cause a target living creature, along with all its carried and worn equipment, to turn to stone. The target must make a Paralysis saving throw. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect. If the save fails, the creature is **petrified**. Neither **dispelling** or*remove curse*can undo **petrification**.

Only the reverse spell, *depetrification*, can turn a petrified creature back to living flesh. If the creature’s petrified form was broken or damaged, then when it is depetrified it suffers equivalent damage or deformities. For instance, if while the petrified, the creature’s stone face had eroded away due to a thousand years of rain, then when depetrified the creature would have a horrific melted visage. (The Judge can choose whatever results on the Mortal Wounds tables he deems appropriate to apply to the hapless creature.) Otherwise, the depetrified creature is exactly as it was the moment it was petrified, with no memory of the intervening period. If *depetrification*iscaston stone that is not the result ofa*petrification* spell or effect, it merely transforms a man-sized volume of stone into a gooey pile of organic matter.

###### Phantasmal Figment

Arcane 2 , Divine 3 Type: illusion

Range: 360’Duration: concentration + 1 round

This spell creates the visual illusion of an area, object, creature, or force, as visualized by the caster, up to a maximum size of 20’ x 20’ x 20’. The illusion does not create sound, smell, texture, or temperature. The caster can move the figment within the limits of the size of the effect. The figment persists so long as the caster maintains concentration, plus an additional 1 round after the caster ceases to concentrate, expiring at the end of the caster’s next initiative.

If used to create the illusion of one or more creatures, the illusory creatures have AC 0 and 1 hp; they immediately disappear if hit in combat. If used to simulate an attack spell or an attacking creature, the illusory attack and damage done should be resolved by the Judge as if it were real. However, any creature affected by illusory damage receives a Spells saving throw to disbelieve the illusion (with a bonus for any senses lacking, see below). If the save succeeds, the creature takes no damage and realizes the *phantasmal figment* is an illusion. If the save fails, the creature believes it has been damaged, possibly fainting into unconsciousness if it believes its hit points have been reduced to 0 or fewer. However, the illusory damage is not real. A “killed” or “injured” creature realizes it is unharmed at the end of its next initiative, and thereafter knows the *phantasmal**figment*is an illusion.

A creature who encounters a *phantasmal**figment* and has reason to be suspicious about its reality can make a Spells saving throw to disbelieve it at the start of its initiative. The creature gains a +4 bonus if the area, object, creature, or force being simulated should have sound, smell, texture, or temperature, provided the creature can tell the figment does not have those qualities. If the save succeeds, the creature confirms the *phantasmal**figment* is an illusion and can see anything the figment is concealing. If the save fails, the creature continues to believe it is real. The creature cannot attempt to disbelieve the *phantasmal**figment*again until it has further evidence of its illusory nature (e.g. a friend tells him “it’s an illusion,” he discovers it has no texture where there should be, etc.).

###### Phantasmal Horror

Arcane 5 Type: illusion

Range: 45’Duration: 1 round/caster level

This spell creates an illusion of whatever a target living creature fears most. The spell uses the target’s own nightmares to create the most terrifying beast it can imagine. Only the caster and the target can sense the *phantasmal**horror***,** which “appears” next to the target. On each subsequent round after it appears, the *phantasmal**horror*attacks the target on the caster’s initiative. It has the attack throw of a 4 HD monster. If its attack throw succeeds, the target immediately dies of fright.

Because it exists only as a hallucination in the target’s mind, the *phantasmal**horror*is invulnerable to attacks, cannot be affected by spells (other than to be **dispelled**), and ignores physical laws. It can pursue the target across any distance and through any barriers. Even a caster who teleports to his own sanctum will find the *horror* there waiting for him! The only defense against the *phantasmal**horror*is to flee into an *anti***-***magic**sphere*, to disbelieve the illusion, to **dispel** the illusion, or to avoid being hit for the duration of the spell.

The target of the *phantasmal**horror* can make a Spells saving throw to disbelieve it at the start of its initiative. If the save succeeds, the phantasmal horror vanishes. If the save fails, the target fully believes the *phantasmal**horror* is real (and is almost certainly doomed). The target receives only one chance to disbelieve the *phantasmal**horror*.

###### Phoenix Aura

Divine 6 Type: blast, elemental (fire)

Range: selfDuration: 1 round/caster level or instantaneous

This spell surrounds the caster with an **aura** of elemental fire to a 5’ radius. The caster is not harmed by the *phoenix aura*itself, but any creatures or objects that begin their initiative in or enter the recipient’s **aura** suffer 1d6 points of extraordinary fire damage. The *phoenix**aura*lasts for one round per level of the caster or until the caster triggers an explosion (see below), whichever comes first.

On his initiative, in lieu of moving and attacking, the caster can amplify the *phoenix**aura* into an explosion that affects all creatures within 10’ of the caster (excluding himself). Each affected creature must make a Blast saving throw. If the save fails, the creature suffers 4d6 extraordinary fire damage plus an additional 1d6 extraordinary fire damage per round left in the spell’s duration. If the save succeeds, the creature takes half that damage.

###### Physical Invulnerability

Arcane 4, Divine 4 Type: protection

Range: touchDuration: 1 turn

This spell grants the recipient invulnerability against one type of physical effect for the duration of the spell. The caster designates the type when the spell is cast, choosing from acidic, bludgeoning, piercing, poisonous, or slashing. The recipient becomes **immune** to both mundane and extraordinary damage of that type. It automatically succeeds on saving throws against spells or special abilities that deal the chosen damage type, and ignores mundane and extraordinary damage of the chosen damage type.

###### Physical Protection

Arcane 2, Divine 2 Type: protection

Range: touchDuration: 6 turns

This spell grants the recipient some protection against one type of physical effect for the duration of the spell. The caster designates the type when the spell is cast, choosing from acidic, bludgeoning, piercing, poisonous, or slashing. The recipient becomes **immune** to mundane damage of the chosen type and automatically succeeds on saving throws against spells or effects that deal mundane damage of the chosen type. It becomes **resistant** to extraordinary damage of the chosen type. The recipient reduces the extraordinary damage dealt by the chosen type by half and gain a +2 bonus on saving throws against spells or special abilities that deal extraordinary damage of the chosen type.

###### Predict Weather

Divine 1 Type: detection, esoteric

Range: 1 mile/levelDuration: 24 hours

This spell enables the caster to accurately predict the weather within range of the spell over the period of the next 24 hours. The spell provides no ability to control the weather, merely foreknowledge of what is coming.

###### Prophetic Dream

Divine 6 Type: detection, esoteric

Range: self Duration: special

This spell can provide the caster with a short piece of meaningful and important information. The caster can designate a specific character, settlement, domain, realm, or object about which he would like information, or open himself to whatever the gods find most important. The information will be relayed in the form of a *prophetic dream*the next time the caster sleeps. The information provided by a *prophetic**dream*is always true, but because it comes in the form of a dream it may be misunderstood due to cryptic symbolism and esoteric meaning. If the caster misunderstands the *prophetic**dream***,** or doesn’t act on the information, the conditions may change so that the information is no longer useful. A character can cast this spell no more than once per week.

###### Programmatic Figment

Arcane 6 Type: illusion

Range: 360’ Duration: Special

This spell imbues an area or object with a 40’ x 40’ x 40’ multi-sensory illusion, identical to that created by *spectral**figment*, which will activate when a specific condition occurs. The *programmatic**figment*must be placed upon a particular area or object. The illusion can be static (e.g. a wall) or dynamic (e.g. a crackling fire or a dragon circling overhead). If dynamic, the illusion will not be interactive in any way, and the dynamic sequence cannot be longer than 1 round per level of the caster.

The conditions to trigger the *programmatic**figment* can be as general or as detailed as desired, although only visual and audible triggers can be used. Triggers react to what appears to be the case. Disguises and illusions can fool them. Normal darkness does not defeat a visual trigger, but magical *tenebrosity* or *invisibility* does. Silent movement or magical silence defeats audible triggers. Audible triggers can be keyed to general types of noises or to a specific noise or spoken word. Actions can serve as triggers if they are visible or audible. A *programmatic**figment* cannot distinguish level, Hit Dice, or class except by external garb.

The range limit of a trigger is 10’ per caster level, so a 12th level caster can command a *programmatic**figment* to respond to triggers as far as 120’ away. Regardless of range, the illusion can respond only to visible or audible triggers and actions in line of sight or within hearing distance.

Once it triggers, the *programmatic**figment*will last until **dispelled**, or to a maximum duration of 1 round per level of the caster. Except as noted above, it functions like a *spectral**figment*.

###### Protection from Temperature

Divine 4 Type: protection

Range: touch Duration: 1 turn per caster level

This spell protects one recipient, plus two additional recipients per 5 caster levels past 1st, from all of the effects of either frigid or sweltering temperatures. The temperature protected against is chosen when the spell is cast and applies to all recipients.

###### Purify Food and Water\*

Divine 1 Type: esoteric

Range: 10’ Duration: instantaneous

The spell removes contaminants from spoiled, rotten, poisonous, or otherwise contaminated food and water, making it edible and drinkable. The spell will purify 50 gallons of water or 300 lbs of food – enough for one platoon of 15 cavalry and mounts or one company of 120 infantry to stay fed or hydrated for one day. The purified food and water is still subject to subsequent contamination or spoilage. Unholy water and similar food and drink of significance is spoiled by *purify food and water*, but the spell has no effect on creatures of any type, nor upon magic potions.

Reversed, this spell becomes *putrefy**food**and**water*. It will spoil 50 gallons of water or 300 lbs of food. Anyone consuming putrefied food and water must make a Death saving throw or become **vomiting** for the next 2 hours (12 turns), unable to do anything save retch and heave.

###### Quest

Arcane 6, Divine 6 Type: enchantment, esoteric

Range: 45’ Duration: special

This spell lays a magical injunction on a target creature, assigning it to carry out a course of action specified by the caster – the eponymous *quest*. After hearing the *quest*, the target creature can, but does not have to, make a Spells saving throw to resist it. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect. If the save fails, or the target creature chooses not to make the save, the *quest*is laid upon it. There are a number of reasons why a creature might waive its saving throw against *quest*. For instance, it may be willing to accept the *quest*in exchange for some promised reward; it might be obliged to accept the quest to offer a sacred vow; it might be condemned due to crimes, with the *quest*offering its only chance of redemption; and so on.

A creature cannot be given a *quest* to kill itself or to pursue a course of action that would result in certain (not just likely) death. Apart from those limits, the creature can be given a *quest* to pursue almost any other course of activity, including harming its allies, giving away cherished belongings, confessing its crimes, and so on.

The affected creature is not compelled to pursue the *quest* it has been given, but if it does not do so it will face terrible negative effects (decided by the Judge) for failing to do so. The negative effects will progress from minor penalties on rolls, to loss of class powers and spells, to reduction in attributes, to injury, sickness, and, ultimately, death. If the negative effects become too much to bear and the creature resumes its *quest*,all of the accrued negative effects are removed after one day. However, should the creature later shirk its *quest*again, all of the accrued negative effects will return instantly and progress from there.

If the *quest* was ambiguously worded or vague as to its meaning, the affected creature might be able to subvert the *quest*. For instance, if the creature has been sent on a *quest* to “find and bring to me a mighty magic sword,” it might be able to fulfill its quest by returning to the caster with a copy of the popular fantasy epic “A Mighty Magic Sword.”

If the *quest* requires the affected creature to complete a task that is logically or physically impossible for it to accomplish, the *quest*ends after one day per caster level. For instance, if the creature has been compelled to “find the nine-fingered kobold who slew Athelstan’s parents,” but Athelstan’s parents are alive and well, the *quest*will not last long. However, the creature might undergo significant torment in the interim as negative effects pile up for his failure to pursue the *quest*.

A *quest* (and all effects thereof) can only be ended by a *remove**curse* spell from a caster of higher level than the caster of the *quest* or by a *miracle*or *wish*. **Dispelling** does not affect a *quest*spell. A quest can be detected with *discern bewitchment*,but cannot be detected with *discern magic*.

###### Rain of Vitriol

Arcane 2 Type: blast, elemental (water)

Range: 180’ Duration: 1 round

This spell can only be cast outdoors in Drizzly or Rainy conditions. When the spell is cast, the caster designates a target point and all rain within a 10’ radius of the target point is transformed into vitriol (sulfuric acid). Each creature that begin its initiative in, or enters, the *rain of vitriol*must make a Blast saving throw.

If the save fails, the creature is soaked with vitriol. It suffers 3d4 extraordinary acidic damage immediately, another 2d4 extraordinary acidic damage at the start of its next initiative, and another 1d4 extraordinary acidic damage at the start of its subsequent initiative. If the save succeeds, the creature is merely splashed with vitriol. It suffers 2d4 extraordinary acidic damage immediately and another 1d4 extraordinary acidic damage on the start of its next initiative. If a creature takes an action in lieu of attacking to clean off the vitriol, it can reduce the amount of damage it or any ally suffers on subsequent rounds by 1 die. If a creature completely immerses itself in water (mere rain is not sufficient), it can reduce the damage it suffers on subsequent rounds to 0.

Metal and stone objects suffer minor corrosion from *rain of vitriol*but the effect is merely cosmetic. Constructs or creatures made of metal and stone cannot be affected by the spell.

###### Remove Curse\*

Divine 3 Type: healing

Range: 45’ Duration: instantaneous (perpetual)

This spell can instantaneously remove any or all curses on a recipient creature. The caster must make an attack throw versus each curse. Each curse is considered to have an armor class equal to the difference in caster level between the creator of the curse and the caster of *remove curse*. If an attack throw succeeds, that particular curse is removed. If an attack throw fails, the spell or effect continues. In addition, if the creator of the curse has a higher caster level than the caster, the caster cannot try again to remove the curse until he has gained a level of experience.

*Remove**curse* can be used to extinguish curses made permanent by ritual magic, but only if the caster is of higher level than whoever made the effect permanent. Certain other special curses cannot be countered by this spell at all, or may be countered only by a caster of a certain level or higher.

A recipient who was cursed to retain and use a particular item (such as a **sword -1**) has one turn after this spell is cast to discard and/or destroy the item. If the recipient has not discarded the item by then, the curse returns. The curse on the object is not itself removed and can afflict future possessors.

The reverse of this spell, *bestow**curse*, allows the caster to place a curse on a target creature or unattended object. The target must make a Spells saving throw. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect. If the save fails, or the target was an unattended object, the curse takes effect. The caster can choose one of the following five effects, which will apply to the target creature or to the future possessor of the target object:

* The affected creature’s seed is despoiled. Any children it births or sires are monstrous, or even monsters (Judge’s choice).
* The affected creature’s mind frays and cracks. Immediately upon being cursed, and each day thereafter upon awakening, it must make a Spells saving throw. If the save fails, it goes mad for 1d6 days (as the spell *incite**madness*). If the save succeeds, the creature retains its mind until the next time it rests and awakens.
* The affected creature’s body is afflicted with a wasting disease for which blood is the only cure. It immediately loses 1d3 points of CHA and 1d3 points of CON, and loses an additional 1 point of CHA and 1 point of CON every month thereafter until it dies. However, if the affected creature sacrifices a sapient Lawful victim and consumes its blood, the wasting disease does not worsen that month. A *delay disease* or *cure**disease* spell can prevent the wasting for one day but does not dispel the effect. When the curse is removed, the creature immediately recovers 1d3 lost CHA and CON and regains an additional point each month thereafter until his normal score is restored.
* The affected creature’s natural gifts are taken away from it. Its highest key attribute is halved and it loses one rank of its highest-ranked general proficiency. If it has several eligible attributes or proficiencies, the creature’s favorite is affected (Judge’s call).
* Something wicked takes an interest in the affected creature. A **cacodemon spawn** (as conjured by the spell) begins to interfere in the creature’s day-to-day activities. If the cacodemon spawn is harmed, the affected creature suffers equal damage itself. If the cacodemon spawn is dispelled or destroyed, a new one arrives the following sunset.

The caster may also invent his own curse, but it should be no more powerful than those described above. The **curse** thus bestowed cannot be **dispelled**, but it can be removed with *dispel evil* or *remove**curse* spell. If desired, the spellcaster can dictate a special condition under which the **curse** will automatically be lifted. Returning a stolen treasure to the tomb it was taken from is the most well-known condition; others are left to the caster’s imagination and the Judge’s discretion. The condition must be spoken aloud when the spell is cast, and must be something actually possible without resort to magic. A special condition is not required, but if one is offered it strengths the curse; a curse with a special condition can only be removed by a caster of greater caster level than the original spellcaster. A *divination* or *fate* spell cast upon the affected creature will reveal the specific condition to lift the curse (if any).

There is no limit to the number of different **curses** a character may suffer from. If not removed, the **curse** is perpetual, lasting until the caster dies or decides to stop sustaining it. (However, **curses** inflicted by magic items end with the death of the target rather than the death of the creator of the item. See p. xxx.)

###### Remove Fear\*

Divine 1 Type: esoteric, healing

Range: 180’ Duration: instantaneous (2 turns)

This spell will calm a target creature. It ends the **faltering**, **frightened**, or **infuriated** condition, whether due to magic or mundane causes.

The reverse of this spell, *cause fear*, can cause one target living creature to become **frightened**. The target must make a Paralysis saving throw. If the save succeeds the spell has no effect. If the spell fails, the target is frightened for the duration of the spell, or until the effect is dispelled by **dispelling** or*remove fear*.A frightened creature cannot attack, cast spells, or speak (except to scream in stark terror). A frightened creature will run from the source of its fear at its full speed for the duration of the spell. If a frightened creature cannot flee, it begins **cowering**. An **engaged** creature that is frightened will remain **cowering** until it is able to disengage with defensive movement. A cowering creature is **vulnerable** and and cannot attack, cast spells, move, or take any other actions until the condition ends.

###### Repair Disfigurement and Disability\*

Divine 4 Type: healing

Range: touch (120’)Duration: instantaneous

This spell can heal a character of a single permanent wound, such as a lost limb, disfiguring scar, or shattered spine (see the **Mortal Wounds** rules in Chapter 6 for details on permanent wounds). Despite this spell’s beneficial results, tampering with the body and soul is never without risk. Each time a character benefits from *repair disfigurement**and disability*, he must roll on the **Tampering with Mortality** table in Chapter 6 and apply these results.

The reverse of this spell, *cause**disfigurement**and disability*, can cause a permanent wound in a living creature. The target receives a Death saving throw. If the save fails, the target must immediately roll on the Mortal Woundstable and suffer the result listed under Permanent Wounds Suffered. When rolling on the Mortal Wound table, the only modifier that applies is the target’s CON modifier. The target does not suffer from the results listed in the Condition & Recovery column. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect. Lawful casters can only use *cause**disfigurement and disability*with great justification, such as legally-mandated judicial punishment.

###### Restore Life and Limb\*

Divine 5 Type: healing

Range: touch (120’)Duration: instantaneous

This spell can restore life to a deceased creature (excluding creatures which are not truly alive, such as constructs, elementals, and undead). However, the spell cannot bring back a creature that has died of old age, lost its head, or had its body cremated.

Because it repairs even lethal damage and regrows flesh and bone, this spell also heals a character of any permanent wounds he had at the time of death, such as lost limbs, disfiguring scars, or shattered spines (see the **Mortal Wounds** table in Chapter 6 for details on permanent wounds). Despite this spell’s beneficial results, tampering with the body and soul is never without risk. Each time a character benefits from *restore life and limb*, he must roll on the **Tampering with Mortality** table in Chapter 6 and apply these results.

If *restore**life**and**limb*is ever cast on an undead monster, the monster must save versus Death or be instantly destroyed.

The reverse of this spell, *extinguish**life*, can slay a living creature. The target receives a Death saving throw. If the save fails, the target creature is instantly slain. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect. Lawful casters may only use *extinguish**life*in life-or-death situations against Chaotic foes.

###### Reveal Ritual Magic

Arcane 6 Type: detection

Range: 100 miles/caster levelDuration: 1 day

This spell reveals whether any ritual spells are being cast within its range. If one or more ritual spells are detected, the character will sense the direction and approximate range to the rituals and the spell signature of the rituals’ casters. This spell takes 1 turn to complete, and may be performed but once per week.

###### Righteous Wrath

Divine 2 Type: transmogrification

Range: touch Duration: 1 turn

This spell imbues a recipient with *righteous wrath*towards the enemies of the faith. The caster can affect one recipient initially, one additional recipient at 6th level, and a third at 11th level. The recipients of *righteous**wrath* gain a +2 bonus to attack throws and become immune to fear, but suffer a -2 penalty to AC. The recipients cannot conduct defensive movement to retreat or withdraw from an enemy within 5’ and cannot move in such a way that the range between them and the nearest visible threat would increase. Recipients must advance 5’ after cleaving if necessary to do so to engage an enemy. *Righteous**wrath* lasts until combat ends or until 1 turn elapses, whichever comes first. The recipient must be man-sized or smaller when this spell is cast or it fails to work.

###### Rouse the Fallen

Arcane 5, Divine 5 Type: necromancy

Range: 15’ Duration: 1 hour

This spell animates the bodies of fallen soldiers and sends them back into battle to carry out one more mission after death. The caster declares the mission when he casts the spell. The mission can be as simple as “rise and kill every living creature you encounter except me” to more complex missions such as “rise, form groups of 30, advance in formation at a running rate to Valerian’s Hill, and then defend the hill from any living creatures that attack it.”

On the round he casts the spell, and on each round thereafter that the caster concentrates, the caster can animate one eligible dead target per caster level, transforming each dead target into an undead zombie. To be an eligible target for this spell, a dead creatures must have fewer than 2 HD in life, died in battle within the last day, and left behind a mostly-intact corpse. When animated, the zombies rise with one more Hit Die than the target’s Baseline HD in life. The zombies carry out this mission to the best of their ability for the duration of the spell, ceasing only when **dispelled** or destroyed. The zombies crumble to dust when the spell expires. If dominated or rebuked by a divine caster, the zombies will return to their mission after the effect expires.

###### Rune of Warding

Arcane 3, Divine 3 Type: esoteric, protection

Range: touch Duration: perpetual

This spell creates a magical rune that harms those who enter, pass, or open the target area or object. A *rune**of**warding* can guard a bridge or passage, ward a portal, trap a chest or box, and so on. The maximum area of effect that can be protected by the ward is 25 square feet per caster level. The caster can ward up to 100 square feet each round. It can take multiple rounds for a caster to create a large rune, during which time the caster must maintain stationary concentration. The *rune* can conform to any shape up to the limitations of the total square footage.

After creating the *rune*, the caster must choose to configure it as either a blast rune or spell rune. The caster must maintain stationary concentration for one additional round to configure the rune, and might have to cast a spell.

*Blast Rune:* A blast rune can damage any creatures in the warded area or touching the warded object when it triggers. To create a blast rune, the caster simply specifies a damage type of his choice at the time of casting, choosing from extraordinary cold, extraordinary electric, extraordinary fire, or extraordinary seismic. When the rune is triggered, each creature must make a Blast saving throw. If the save fails, the creature takes 2 extraordinary cold, fire, electric, or seismic damage per caster level. If the save succeeds, the creature takes half that damage.

*Spell Rune:* A spell rune can release a spell stored in the rune when it triggers. To create a spell rune, the caster must cast a blast, death, enchantment, reversed healing, or transmogrification spell of his choice into the rune. When the rune is triggered, the stored spell is cast at caster level. If the spell has an area of effect, the area of effect is centered on the center of the area or object warded. If the spell targets one or more creatures, it targets eligible creatures in order of proximity to the center of the area or object warded. The stored spells effects are resolved according to its description.

After he configures the rune, the caster sets a password. The password must be short enough to say in a few seconds but can be in any language the caster speaks. Thereafter any creature entering or touching the warded area or opening the warded object without speaking the password within one round triggers the rune.

It is easy to accidentally trigger a *rune of warding*, because a completely configured *rune* is nearly invisible. It can be detected as a trap or with spells such as *discern**magic* or *true**seeing*. It can be **dispelled** normally. Alternatively, a character with Trapbreaking proficiency who also has a class power or proficiency enabling him to cast spells, read spell scrolls, or use arcane magic items can safely destroy a *rune**of**warding*with a successful proficiency throw.

A *rune**of**warding*vanishes when triggered. The spell is otherwise perpetual, lasting until dispelled or until the caster dies or decides to stop sustaining it.

**Ashley J. Williams Second Memorial Rule (optional):** If the creature entering or touching the warded area or opening the warded object knows and speaks the password, but cannot speak the language it’s in, he must make an Implements saving throw. If the save succeeds, he successfully speaks the password. If the save fails, he mangles the pronunciation so badly that the *rune*is triggered.

###### Salvific Rain

Divine 6 Type: blast, elemental (water)

Range: 225’Duration: instantaneous

This spell calls down an enchanted rain from the heavens onto a 25’ diameter target area. All fire within the area is instantaneously extinguished. An elemental fire spell with a duration is not **dispelled**, so it might cause further damage in future rounds, but any current fires are put out. Since the *salvific rain*comes from the sky, it cannot extinguish flames that are underground or enclosed within a structure. *Salvific rain*is of great use in naval battles and sieges, when it can save vessels and strongholds from fire.

###### Salving Rest

Divine 1 Type: esoteric, healing

Range: touch Duration: special

This spell allows the recipient to enjoy soothing, peaceful sleep, free of pain and sorrow, whenever he slumbers. As a result of this *salving**rest*, the recipient of the spell will heal an extra 1d3 hit points during each day of complete rest. If the recipient is **enervated**, he gains a +4 bonus on his Death saving throw and can end the condition with two, rather than three, successful saves in a row. The spell ends when the recipient stops completely resting or if he takes any damage.

###### Sanctuary

Divine 1 Type: esoteric, protection

Range: touch Duration: 2 rounds + 1 round/caster level

This spell protects the recipient from aggression. Any enemy attempting to attack the recipient must make a Spells saving throw. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect on that enemy. If the save fails, the enemy cannot attack the recipient. It does not lose its attack and can attack another creature instead. An enemy that is casting a spell, using a special ability, or wielding an item that produces an area of effect does not need to save to be able to include the recipient in the area of effect. If the recipient makes an attack, engages an enemy, or casts a spell that harms enemies, the spell immediately ends. The recipient can decide not to engage opponents in order to avoid ending the spell.

###### Safe Travels

Arcane 4, Divine 5 Type: transmogrification

Range: touch Duration: special

This spell protects a recipient on a journey, guiding him to his destination safe and unhindered. The recipient gains a +2 bonus on proficiency throws to avoid getting lost. In any terrain except clear and grassland terrain, the recipient receives a +3 bonus to proficiency throws to evade wilderness encounters. The duration of the spell extends for the length of the recipient’s journey, to a maximum duration of one month. The recipient must be man-sized or smaller when this spell is cast or it fails to work.

###### Scouring Zephyr

Arcane 4 Type: blast, elemental (air)

Range: 0’ Duration: instantaneous

This spell summons up a *scouring**zephyr* from the skies. Because the spell draws its power from atmospheric winds, it can only be cast outdoors or in a well-ventilated room. The *scouring**zephyr*sweeps from the caster to affect all creatures in a cone 60’ long and 10’ wide at its terminus. Each creature within the cone must make a Blast saving throw. If the save fails, the creature suffer 7d4 extraordinary slashing damage from abrasion and debris whipped up by the *zephyr*and is buffeted by wind (see below). If the save succeeds, the creature suffers half that damage but is not affected by wind. Objects are always affected by the wind unless carried or worn.

Creatures buffeted by wind suffer additional effects, depending on their size:

* Tiny creatures and objects on the ground are knocked prone and pushed back 1d4x10’, taking 1d4 points of nonlethal bludgeoning damage per 10’. Tiny creatures and objects in the air are pushed back 2d6x10’ feet and take 2d6 points of nonlethal bludgeoning damage.
* Small creatures and objects on the ground are knocked prone by the force of the wind. Small creatures or objects in the air are knocked back 1d6x10’ feet.
* Man-sized creatures and objects on the ground suffer no additional effects. Man-sized creatures or objects in the air are pushed back 1d6x5’.
* Large or larger creatures or objects suffer no additional affects.

In addition, the force of the *scouring zephyr*automatically extinguishes any candles, torches, or other unprotected flames. It extinguishes protected flames unless the bearer succeeds on a Paralysis saving throw. A *scouring zephyr*will also do anything that a sudden blast of 50 mph wind would be expected to do, such as fan a large fire, overturn delicate awnings, create a spray of dust, or blow vapors out of range (Judge’s discretion).

###### Scry

Arcane 4, Divine 5 Type: detection, esoteric

Range: special Duration: 1 turn

This spell enables the spellcaster to see moving images of a target creature, object, or place of his choice, regardless of any intervening distance. The spellcaster must have access to a mirror, crystal, reflective pool, or other surface upon which the images can be displayed. The more familiar the caster is with the creature, object or place viewed, the clearer the images will be. The larger the area of the place viewed, the more clouded the images will be. If the target is inside an *anti***-***magic**sphere* or protected by *indiscernibility*, the images will be entirely opaque, revealing nothing.

The apparent point of view displayed depends on the size of the target: It will always be just far enough away from the target that its entire body (if a creature), surface area (if an object), or vicinity (if a place) is seen. The Judge chooses the exact angle and point. For instance, if the caster scries a castle, the Judge might decide he sees an image of the castle as if from a hill overlooking its entirety. If the caster scries a lord in that castle, the Judge might decide he sees an image of the lord as if from a courtier in the throne room.

If the caster chooses, he can cast either*clairaudiency*or *telepathy*at the same time that he casts *scry*in order to use one of those spells while scrying. If so, the range of that spell is measured from the apparent point of view from which the caster is scrying. The spellcaster is otherwise unable to cast spells at or communicate with what he views.

Anytime a creature capable of casting *scry* (due to its repertoire or a spell-like ability or current use of a magic item) is the target of *scry*, is in the target place, or is carrying or wearing the target object, the creature has a chance of learning he is being spied on. The Judge must make a secret Spells saving throw on behalf of the creature. If the save fails, the creature learns nothing. If the saving throw succeeds, the creature knows he is being scried upon and learns the spell signature of the caster doing so. If the scried creature itself casts *scry*while the original caster is still maintaining concentration, the scried creature can then scry on the caster with the same clarity that the caster is seeing with. (And yes, the original caster now gets a Spells saving throw to detect that he is now being scried on!) If the scried creature casts *counterspell*or *dispel**magic*, the *scry*spell is considered an eligible target to be **dispelled**.

The caster can scry on his target for up to 1 turn, but must maintain stationary concentration throughout. If the caster stops concentrating for any reason, the images vanish and the spell expires.

###### Seal Portal

Arcane 1, Divine 1 Type: esoteric, movement

Range: 10’ Duration: 2d6 turns

This spell magically seals a chest, door, gate, portcullis, shutter, or window. The spell closes the portal as if it were securely fastened and locked, though the portal cannot be picked. A *seal**portal* lasts until it is **dispelled** or its duration expires or until the portal is physically destroyed.

###### Selective Fire

Arcane 5 Type: blast, elemental (fire)

Range: 0’ Duration: instantaneous

This spell creates a 60’ long x 30’ diameter cone of fiery bolts that sprays from the caster’s outstretched fingers to strike a selection of targets. The caster can designate any, some, or all of the creatures in the cone as targets. Each target must make a Blast saving throw. If the save fails, the target suffers 3d6 extraordinary fire damage. If the save succeeds, the target suffers half that damage.

The*selective**fire* can also target any, some, or all of the structures in the cone. Each targeted structure takes up to 3d6 extraordinary fire structural damage if wood, or one-fifth that if stone. (It might deal less if the structure is not entirely in its area of effect.) It can set any, some, or all of the combustible materials in the cone aflame.

###### Sharpness

Arcane 1 Type: transmogrification

Range: touch Duration: 3 turns

This spell temporarily enhances one or more edged or pointed weapons to the equivalent of a **magic weapon +1**. The bonus does not stack with masterwork weapon bonuses, but magic weapons gain an additional +1 to damage. A single casting will affect 20 arrows, 2 tiny one-handed weapons, or one small, medium, or large weapon.

###### Shatter Blade

Arcane 1, Divine 1 Type: blast, elemental (earth)

Range: 45’ Duration: instantaneous

This spell can destroy a weapon, causing its blade to shatter or melt away into smoke. If the weapon is an ordinary item that is not being held by a creature, the weapon is automatically shattered. If the weapon is held by a creature, the wielder must make a Death saving throw, adding the weapon’s magic bonus (if any) to the save. If the weapon is a magic item that is not being held by a creature, the weapon must make a Death saving throw as a fighter of a level equal to its magic bonus. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect. If the save fails, the weapon is shattered. The spell causes no harm to the creature holding the weapon (except for depriving him of it).

A caster of 6th level or higher can shatter two weapons, while a caster of 11th level of higher can shatter three weapons. The weapons may be held by the same creature or by different creatures within range. Each creature or weapon saves separately in any case.

###### Shrieking Skull

Arcane 4 Type: esoteric, necromancy

Range: 45’ Duration: 1 turn

This spell allows the caster to animate the skull of a single human or humanoid. The *shrieking**skull* acts according to the caster’s will, doing whatever is mentally commanded of it.

The caster can give verbal orders to the *shrieking**skull*when he first animates it and thereafter anytime it is in line of sight on his initiative. Complex or extensive orders require the caster to expend action in lieu of moving, but simple orders (“protect me!”) do not require an action. Orders can be given in any language the caster speaks. The *shrieking**skull*will mindlessly obey whatever orders it is given to the best of its (limited) ability. It cannot accomplish tasks that require abstract thought or higher reasoning. If it completes all of its orders, or for whatever reason is physically unable to obey its orders, the *shrieking**skull* will simply remain stationary until it receives new orders. The *shrieking**skull* acts on its own initiative each round.

The skull has 4+4 Hit Dice and an AC of 9. It can fly with a combat speed of 60’. It can attack with a bite or a fearful shriek. The bite deals 1d6 piercing damage and can induce fear in the bitten creature. The fearful shriek can affect all living creatures within 10’ of the shrieking skull. A living creature bitten by the skull or within the area of effect of its piercing shriek must make a Paralysis saving throw. If the save fails, the creature becomes **frightened** for 2 turns. If the save succeeds, the creature is not affected by the fear. When the shriek is used, or at the end of the spell’s duration (whichever comes first), the skull crumbles to the floor. The skull cannot be rebuked.

Shrieking Skull: MV 60’/180’ (fly), AC 9, HD 4+4, #AT 1, DG 1d6 + fear or shriek, SV C5, ML +4, AL C

###### Shimmer

Divine 2 Type: protection

Range: self Duration: 6 turns

This spell surrounds the caster with a shimmering aura that grants her a bonus of +2 to armor class and saving throws.

###### Shrouding Fog

Arcane 2 Type: elemental (air), esoteric, wall

Range: 0’ Duration: 1 turn/caster level

This spell conjures a thick misty vapor around the spellcaster. The *shrouding fog* is 10’ in diameter per caster level and 10’ high. Because the spell draws its power from natural air, it can only be cast outdoors or in a well-ventilated room. The *shrouding**fog* is harmless, but blocks line of sight for most creatures. The caster, and any creatures able to see invisible entities, can see dimly through *shrouding**fog*but all others within the cloud are effectively **blinded** until they exit it.

Once created, the *shrouding**fog*can be affected by water or strong winds like an ordinary mist, though other attacks will have correspondingly little effect on it. A *counterspell*, *disintegration***,** or *dispel magic* spell can destroy the *shrouding**fog*instantly; it will otherwise dissipate in 1 turn per caster level.

###### Silent Step

Arcane 1 Type: transmogrification

Range: touch Duration: 1 turn/caster level

This spell allows the recipient to walk with nearly total silence. If the creature is not proficient in Sneaking, it becomes proficient with a Sneaking proficiency throw of 12+. If the creature is already proficient in Sneaking, it gains a +8 bonus to its Sneaking proficiency throws. The recipient must be man-sized or smaller when this spell is cast or it fails to work.

###### Skinchange

Arcane 3, Divine 4 Type: transmogrification

Range: self Duration: 1 turn/caster level

This spell allows the caster to assume the form of a normal or giant animal. (See the Animals type in the ***ACKS II******Monstrous Manual*** for details) that is native to his location. The caster gains the physical capabilities, physical attacks, special abilities, and statistics of the animal form he assumes, while retaining his own mental abilities (including the ability to cast spells). The caster must be man-sized or smaller when he casts this spell or it fails to work.

The caster can change to a new animal form each round. For example, he might initially transform into a rabbit to spy on enemies, change into a lion for a fight, then transform into an eagle to fly away when the fight goes badly. The caster can continue to *skinchange*freely until he reverts to his original form or until 1 turn per level has elapsed. If slain, the caster reverts to his original form.

Because the animal must be native to the caster’s location, the caster cannot transform into dinosaurs or other prehistoric animals unless in a “lost world” where such creatures still roam the earth. Likewise, the caster cannot transform into a whale in the middle of the desert, or into a lion in the tundra.

###### Slicing Blow

Arcane 1 , Divine 2 Type: death

Range: 45’ Duration: instantaneous

This spell allows the caster to necromantically inflict a vicious cut on a target creature within range. The caster must make an attack throw against the target. If the attack throw succeeds, the *slicing blow*deals 1d10 extraordinary slashing damage to the target.

At 3rd level, and every two levels thereafter (5th, 7th, 9th, 11th, and 13th level), the caster gains the ability to inflict an additional *slicing**blow***.** The caster’s *slicing**blows* can all strike at one target or can strike at different targets, as desired; roll a separate attack throw for each *slicing**blow*.

###### Slickness

Arcane 1 Type: elemental (water), wall

Range: touch Duration: 3 turns

This spell creates a slippery magical fluid. It can target one or more objects, a 10’ x 10’ surface area of floor, or a willing creature.

If the target is one or more objects, the affected objects become virtually impossible to grab or hold. The spell can affect 20 arrows, 2 tiny weapons, or 1 small, medium, or large weapon. Creatures attempting to grab an affected object must make an attack against AC 10. If the attack hits, the creature grabs the object. If the attack misses, it fails to grasp it. Creatures holding an affected object must make a Paralysis saving throw at the end of their initiative. If the save fails, the object slips out of the creature’s grasp and falls in a random location within 5’. If the save succeeds, the creature maintains its grip on it. It is possible for a creature to grab an item with its attack but then drop it at the end of their initiative if their save fails.

If the target is an area of floor, any creature starting its initiative in, or moving into, the affected area must make a Paralysis saving throw. If the creature is eligible to use Acrobatics, it gains a +2 bonus to its saving throw. If not, the creature suffers a penalty of -4 if wearing light armor, -6 if wearing medium armor, or -8 if wearing heavy armor. (Natural armor does not impose a penalty.) If the save fails, the creature immediately falls prone. If the save succeeds, the creature can act or continue to act without falling that round. Unlike most wall spells, slickness can be evoked in areas where creatures are present.

If the target is a willing creature, the recipient cannot be **grabbed**, **restrained, wrestled**, or otherwise subject to any other form of bondage, including binding ropes, chains, or cuffs, magical or otherwise. Simply put, nothing can get a grip on a recipient affected by *slickness*.

###### Sling Stone

Arcane 1 , Divine 1 Type: blast, elemental (earth)

Range: 180’ Duration: instantaneous

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Environment** | **No. of Objects** |
| Room, Rubbled | 2d10 |
| Room, Cluttered | 1d10 |
| Room, Sparse | 1d6 |
| Room, Empty | 1d6-3 |
| Barren/Desert/Mountains | 1d10 |
| Hills/Jungle/Scrub/Woods | 1d6 |
| Clear/Grass/Swamp | 1d3 |

This spell allows the caster to magically sling one or more small objects at targets within range. The caster can sling up to one object per level of experience. The objects can be slung at one target or distributed across several targets, as desired. The spellcaster must make a successful attack throw with each object. Each object that successfully hits deals 1d4 bludgeoning damage to its target.

To be slung by this spell, an object must be either in the caster’s hands or lying on the ground within 5’; must be made of clay, stone, or metal; and must weigh no more than 8 ounces. Most casters will carry a pouch of sling stones or bullets for use with this spell, but if necessary, a caster may resort to slinging objects that are littering the ground nearby. The Judge may randomly determine how many eligible objects are nearby based on the caster’s environment by rolling on the adjoining table.

###### Slumber

Arcane 1 , Divine 2 Type: enchantment

Range: 180’ Duration: 1 turn/caster level

This spell can put to sleep any living targets with fewer than 5 HD situated within a 10’ diameter sphere. Each target with 2 HD or more can make a Paralysis saving throw. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect. If the save fails, or if the target has fewer than 2 HD, the target begins **slumbering**. A slumbering creature is **helpless**, **blind**, **deaf**, and **mute**. Attacking, damaging, or moving a slumbering creature awakens it, but normal noise does not until the expiration of the spell.

###### Slumber, Deep

Arcane 4 , Divine 6 Type: enchantment

Range: 180’ Duration: 1 turn/caster level

This spell can put to sleep any living targets situated within a 20’ diameter sphere. Each target in the sphere must make a Paralysis saving throw. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect. If the save fails, the target is **slumbering**. A slumbering creature is **helpless**, **blind**, **deaf**, and **mute**. Attacking, damaging, or moving a slumbering creature awakens it, but normal noise does not.

###### Smite Undead\*

Divine 4 Type: necromancy

Range: 225’ (touch)Duration: instantaneous (special)

This spell can destroy one or more undead targets situated within a 60’ diameter sphere. A number of Hit Dice of undead equal to twice caster level can be affected. Undead with the fewest HD are affected first, and undead with 9 HD or more are never affected. Any excess HD of effectiveness are lost. When one or more creatures with the same number of HD are eligible to be targets, the caster can choose which are affected. Affected skeletons and zombies are instantly destroyed. Other affected undead must make a Death saving throw. If the save fails, the undead is instantly destroyed. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect on that undead.

The reverse of this spell, *animate undead*,functions exactly like the 4th level spell of the same name.

###### Snakes to Staffs\*

Divine 4 Type: transmogrification

Range: 45’ Duration: 1 turn per level

This spell can transform one target snake per caster level into a staff of hardwood. Each snake must make a Spells saving throw. If the save fails, it is transformed into an inert piece of wood of approximately the same size. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect on that snake. When the spell expires or if it is dispelled, the snake returns to its original form. If the snake’s wooden form was damaged, then when it returns to snake form, it suffers equivalent damage. If the snake’s wooden form was broken, when it returns to snake form it is slain. Treat snake-staffs as wooden objects with AC 0 and structural hit points equal to one-fifth the snake’s hit points.

The reverse Of this spell, *staffs to snakes*, spell transforms one target branch, bow, stick, staff or other piece of lengthy hardwood per caster level into a snake of the caster’s choice. Magic rods, staffs, and wands cannot be affected by this spell, but nonmagical wood can be targeted even if carried by a creature. If the target staff is being carried by a creature, the creature can make a Spells saving throw to resist the effect. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect on that staff. If the save fails, the carried staff is turned into a snake while still in the creature’s grasp; the snake receives an immediate attack against the creature carrying it, as if it were readied.

The newly-formed snakes begin to act on the next round on their own initiative. They are not under the command of the caster unless he uses a class power, proficiency, or spell to befriend, **bewitch**, **dominate**, or otherwise influence them. The snakes return to being pieces of wood when the spell expires or is **dispelled**.

###### Soul Eating

Arcane 6 Type: death, necromancy

Range: touch Duration: 1 day

The caster can draw and devour the soul from a living target, temporarily gaining a fraction of the victim’s knowledge and vigor. The spell is usually cast on bound and helpless victims. The target must make a Death saving throw.

Even if the saving throw succeeds, the target is still slain, but his soul eludes the caster’s grasp. If the saving throw fails, the target is slain and his soul is eaten by the caster. Targets whose souls are eaten cannot be restored to life by any means short of a *miracle* or *wish*. The caster immediately gains 1d10 temporary hit points + 1 hp per level of the target. In addition, the caster learns some important knowledge possessed by the target, either a specific set of facts that the caster was seeking or some random knowledge chosen by the Judge. The knowledge learned can be quite complex, equivalent to a single rank in a proficiency, a class power, a spell formula, or a language.

The temporary hit points will disappear at the expiration of the spell’s duration, while the knowledge will fade as if it was a barely-remembered dream. Nothing prevents a caster from writing down the knowledge gained from this spell before it fades, however.

EXAMPLE: Ra-Ramses wishes to plumb the depths of the dungeon of his rival, Baldur the Black. Baldur’s dungeon is reputed to be a deadly maze filled with traps, secret doors, and foul guardians, so Ra-Ramses abducts Archimedian, the engineer who built the dungeon, and casts *soul eating* on him. Archimedian (a 5th level mage) fails his Death saving throw, so his soul is eaten by Ra-Ramses. Ra-Ramses gains 1d10+5 hp. The Judge decides that having complete knowledge of the layout and design of Baldur’s dungeon is equivalent to the Mapping proficiency, and thus within the purview of the spell. Ra-Ramses now has a day to exploit this knowledge, either by venturing into the dungeon immediately or by spending a day drafting maps.

While *soul**eating*is in effect, the spellcaster is treated as an inherently evil creature for purposes of *discern**evil*and *holy circle*effects. A successful *counterspell, dispel**evil*or *dispel**magic*spell will strip the caster of his temporary proficiency and hit points.

###### Soul Swap

Arcane 5 Type: esoteric, necromancy

Range: 45’Duration: indefinite

The caster transfers his soul into an inanimate object known as a phylactery. The phylactery can be an amulet, gem, jewelry box, locket, ring, or other item weighing 1/6 stone or less with no more than 1 shp. At the moment the spell is cast, the phylactery must be within spell range and the caster must know where it is, though he does not need to be able to see it. As soon as the caster transfers his soul into the phylactery, his physical body falls limp, seemingly lifeless. (A character who spends a round inspecting the body and makes a successful Healing proficiency throw to diagnose can ascertain that the body is alive in a state of suspended animation.)

From the phylactery, the caster can use an action in lieu of attacking to return to his own body if it is within 120’ of the phylactery. Alternatively, he can use an action in lieu of attacking to attempt to possess the body of a nearby living creature within 120’ of the phylactery. The target creature is allowed a Death saving throw to resist. If the creature succeeds on its saving throw, the caster’s soul remains in the phylactery, and the target creature is immune to further attempts at possession for one turn (10 minutes). If the creature fails its saving throw, its body becomes possessed by the caster’s soul, while the creature’s soul becomes imprisoned in the phylactery. While possessing a creature’s body, the caster keeps his or her Intellect, Will, Charisma, level, class, attack bonus, saving throws, and mental abilities (including spellcasting ability), but gains the body’s Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, hit points, and natural abilities. The caster does not have access to any special abilities of the body, however.

From a possessed body, the caster can take use an action in lieu of moving to abandon the body and return his soul to the phylactery, simultaneously releasing the trapped soul back to its own body. The spell ends when the caster’s soul returns to his own body, leaving the phylactery empty.

If the caster’s soul is in the phylactery, and the phylactery is destroyed or **dispelled**, then there are two possible outcomes. If the phylactery is within 120’ of the caster’s body, then the caster’s soul returns to its body. Otherwise, the caster’s soul departs and he dies. In either case, the spell ends.

If the caster’s soul is driven from a possessed body by *dispel evil* there are also two possibilities. If the phylactery is within 120’ of the possessed body, then the caster’s soul returns to the phylactery, and the possessed body’s soul returns to it. The caster cannot attempt to possess the same creature again for one full turn (10 minutes). If the phylactery is not in range of the possessed body, then the possessed creature’s spirit is freed from the phylactery, both the caster’s and the possessed body’s souls depart, and both the caster and the possessed creature die. In either case, the spell ends.

If a possessed creature’s soul is in thephylactery, and the phylactery is broken then one of the following may happen. If the phylactery is in range of the possessed creature’s body, then the caster’s spirit departs, the caster dies, the possessed creature’s soul returns to its body, and the spell ends. Otherwise, the possessed creature’s soul departs, and the caster’s soul is stranded in the possessed body. Note here that the spell has not ended. *Dispel**evil* can still be used to drive the caster’s spirit from the body, which departs as noted, ending the spell. In any case where the spell ends with the caster’s body unoccupied by a spirit, that body does truly die.

###### Speak with Beasts

Divine 2 Type: esoteric

Range: special Duration: 6 turns

This spell grants the caster the ability to communicate with ordinary and giant animals that are within his line of sight and able to hear him. The spell magically translates the animals’ natural vocalizations into language comprehensible to the caster. However, the spell doesn’t make the animals friendlier or smarter. Most animals, being of bestial sapiency, can only relay concrete facts punctuated with inane comments. Semi-sapient animals, such as dolphins, elephants, or parrots, can communicate concepts and opinions, though they will tend to be terse and evasive. However, if an animal is friendly towards the caster, it might be willing to grant some favor or service. *Speak with beasts* does not permit conversation with sapient creatures.

###### Speak with Dead

Arcane 3, Divine 3 Type: esoteric, necromancy

Range: 10’ Duration: 1 turn

This spell grants the caster the ability to communicate with a target corpse or skeleton. The target corpse or skeleton must have come from a sapient living creature and must still have a largely-intact brain or skull with a mouth or jawbone. If both the brain and skull have rotted away or been destroyed, the target does not remember anything. If both the mouth or jawbone have rotted away or been destroyed, the target cannot answer any questions. When someone is slain to keep them quiet, the killer will often bash in the skull, cut away the brain, and remove the lips and jaw to avoid the remains being able to answer questions.

The caster may ask the target corpse or skeleton one question per two caster levels. He may ask questions at the rate of one per round; each question is answered by the corpse or skeleton during the same round. Unasked questions are wasted if the duration expires. The corpse’s knowledge is limited to what the creature knew during life, including the languages it spoke (if any). Answers are often brief, cryptic, or repetitive. Any given corpse or skeleton can only be targeted by this spell once per week.

*Speak with dead* does not actually contact the deceased creature’s soul. Instead, it draws on the remnants of spiritual residue that still linger in the corpse or skeleton. Thus, the remains possess only the knowledge that the creature had while alive, but not any information about events that transpired after its death or experiences in the afterlife. For instance, the corpse of a man who was slain by bugbears and then ritually impaled on a chthonic totem would remember everything up to the moment of its death, but would have no information about the ritual that caused its impalement or about what life is like in heaven or his current reincarnation.

This spell cannot target a corpse or skeleton that is or was ever animated as an undead creature.

###### Speak with Plants

Divine 4 Type: esoteric

Range: 45’ Duration: 3 turns

This spell grants the caster the ability to communicate with both ordinary mindless plants and semi-sapient or sapient plant creatures that are within his line of sight. The spell magically translates the plants’ biochemical, electrical, and mycocultural messages into language comprehensible to the caster. However, the spell doesn’t make the plants friendlier or smarter.

Ordinary plants, being rather vegetative, communicate freely with the caster, as they have nothing else better to do. They will gossip endlessly about things such as their ambitions for taller branches, more leaves, or deeper roots; the poor or robust health of neighboring plants; the ease or difficulty of getting enough sunshine; the existence of any caverns, dungeons, or objects buried impinging on their root networks; the causes of damage that nearby plants have suffered; the proximity and nature of other nearby plants; the proximity and nature of nearby plant predators (i.e. herbivores); the proximity and nature of symbiotic creatures that help the plant flourish (e.g. honey bees); the general weather and soil conditions they have experienced; and, of course, their existential dread of being eaten.

Semi-sapient and sapient plant creatures can communicate in much the same fashion as any other monster, but will tend to be terse and evasive. However, if a plant creature is friendly towards the caster, it might be willing to grant some favor or service.

###### Spectral Figment

Arcane 4 , Divine 6 Type: illusion

Range: 360’ Duration: concentration + 3 rounds

This spell creates a multi-sensory illusion of an area, object, creature, or force, as visualized by the caster, up to a maximum size of 40’ x 40’x 40’. The illusion includes visual, auditory, olfactory, tactile, and thermal components. The caster can move the figment within the limits of the size of the effect. The figment persists so long as the caster maintains concentration, plus an additional 3 rounds after the caster ceases to concentrate, expiring at the end of the caster’s next initiative.

If used to create the illusion of one or more creatures, the illusory creatures have AC 0 and 1 hp; they immediately disappear if hit in combat. If used to simulate an attack spell or an attacking creature, the illusory attack and damage done should be resolved by the Judge as if it were real. However, any creature affected by illusory damage receives a Spells saving throw to disbelieve the illusion. If the save succeeds, the creature takes no damage and realizes the *spectral figment* is an illusion. If the save fails, the creature believes it has been damaged, possibly fainting into unconsciousness if it believes its hit points have been reduced to 0 or fewer. However, the illusory damage is not real. A “killed” or “injured” creature realizes it is unharmed at the end of its initiative in 1d6 rounds, and thereafter knows the *spectral**figment*is an illusion.

A creature who encounters a *spectral**figment* and has reason to be suspicious about its reality can make a Spells saving throw to disbelieve it at the start of its initiative. If the save succeeds, the creature confirms the *spectral**figment* is an illusion and can see, hear, smell, taste, or feel anything the figment is concealing. If the save fails, the creature continues to believe it is real. The creature cannot attempt to disbelieve the *spectral**figment*again until it has further evidence of its illusory nature (e.g. a friend tells him “it’s an illusion,” etc.).

###### Spectral Legion

Arcane 5 Type: illusion

Range: 360’ Duration: concentration

This spell was created for use by war-wizards on the field of battle. It creates a multi-sensory illusion of a complete military unit of up to 120 man-sized creatures, 60 large (cavalry or ogre-sized) creatures, 20 huge creatures, 5 gigantic creatures, or 1 colossal creature. The unit can be of any type, equipped with any arms or armor desired, wearing whatever colors, insignia, and unit markings the caster wishes. It can appear fresh and well-ordered, or bloodied and demoralized, or anything in between.

Once the *spectral**legion* is conjured, it can be moved anywhere within range at the same speed as an actual unit of its type. The *spectral**legion*moves on the caster’s own initiative. The illusion is fully dynamic, so the unit will seem to march, trot, gallop, fly, or otherwise actually move, and as it does so its boots will seemingly kick up dust, its banners will seemingly wave in the breeze, and so on. The *spectral**legion*will remain on the battlefield for as long as the caster maintains concentration.

If attacked, the illusory creatures that make up the *spectral**legion*appear to have the AC of a real unit of their type. If damaged, the creatures will appear to suffer wounds, but are never slain and do not vanish. If the spectral legion attacks, the illusory attack and damage should be resolved by the Judge as if it were real. However, any creature affected by illusory damage receives a Spells saving throw to disbelieve the illusion. If the save succeeds, the creature takes no damage and realizes the *spectral**legion* is an illusion. If the save fails, the creature believes it has been damaged, possibly fainting into unconsciousness if it believes its hit points have been reduced to 0 or fewer. However, the illusory damage is not real. A “killed” or “injured” creature realizes it is unharmed at the end of its initiative in 1d6 rounds, and thereafter knows the *spectral**legion*is an illusion.

A creature who encounters a *spectral**legion* and has reason to be suspicious about its reality can make a Spells saving throw to disbelieve it at the start of its initiative. If the save succeeds, the creature confirms the *spectral**legion* is an illusion and can see, hear, smell, taste, or feel anything it is concealing. If the save fails, the creature continues to believe it is real. The creature cannot attempt to disbelieve the *spectral**legion*again until it has further evidence of its illusory nature (e.g. a friend tells him “it’s an illusion,” he notices that no matter how often he hits an illusory creature it never dies, etc.).

###### Spellward

Arcane 3 , Divine 3 Type: protection

Range: self Duration: 6 turns

This spell creates a defensive ward around the caster. The *spellward* has a number of layers equal to caster level. When the caster makes a saving throw against a spell, elemental effect, or spell-like effect, he can expend one or more layers of the *spellward* to gain a +1d4 bonus per layer to the saving throw. After the saving throw (if any) is resolved, the caster can expend one or more layers of the *spellward* to reduce the damage by 1d4 points per layer. If the damage is reduced to 0 or less by the *spellward*, the caster does not suffer an interruption of concentration or other effects that may accrue upon being hit. If a *spellwarded* caster is subjected to a *counterspell* or *dispel magic* spell, he can expend one or more layers from the ward to increase his effective caster level by 1d4 per layer, making it harder to **dispel** his magic. *Spellward* expires when all of the layers are expended, or after 6 turns, whichever comes first. If this spell is made *permanent* through ritual magic, the *spellward* recharges two layers per turn.

EXAMPLE: Quintus, a 6th level caster, is in a magical duel! He had previously cast *spellward*, and as a 6th level caster his ward has six layers. He is in the middle of casting *thunderbolt* when his opponent strikes him with a *fireball* that deals 21 fire damage. Quintus expends one layer of the ward to gain a +1d4 bonus on the saving throw. His save then succeeds, halving the damage to 10 points. He then expends the last five layers of the ward to reduce the damage by 5d4 points. He rolls the dice and the result is a 12! The damage has been reduced to 0 or less, and his spell is not interrupted. On his initiative number, he blasts his opponent with *thunderbolt!*

###### Spellward Other

Arcane 4 , Divine 4 Type: protection

Range: touch Duration: 6 turns

This spell creates a defensive ward around the recipient. The *spellward* has a number of layers equal to caster level. When the recipient makes a saving throw against a spell, elemental effect, or spell-like effect, it can expend one or more layers of the *spellward* to gain a +1d4 bonus per layer to the saving throw. After the saving throw (if any) is resolved, the recipient can expend one or more layers of the *spellward* to reduce the damage by 1d4 points per layer. If the damage is reduced to 0 or less by the *spellward*, the recipient does not suffer an interruption of concentration or other effects that may accrue upon being hit. If a *spellwarded* recipient is subjected to *counterspell* or *dispel magic* spell, it can expend one or more layers from the ward to increase his effective caster level by 1d4 per layer, making it harder to **dispel** his magic. *Spellward**other* expires when all of the layers are expended, or after 6 turns, whichever comes first. If this spell is made *permanent* through ritual magic, the *spellward* recharges two layers per turn.

###### Spellwarded Zone

Arcane 6 , Divine 6 Type: protection

Range: touch Duration: 6 turns

This spell creates a defensive ward that protects a 20’ diameter sphere. The *spellward* has a number of layers equal to caster level. The *spellward*automatically triggers whenever a spell, elemental effect, or spell-like effect would affect the area. If a spell, elemental effect, or spell-like effect affects an area that is inclusive of the *spellwarded**zone*, but also affects areas outside the *zone*, the *spellward*will trigger, but its protection only extends to its own area of effect.

EXAMPLE: Quintus, Marcus, Balbus, and Viktir are standing in a large amphitheater, 100’ in radius, the four of them strung out in a line 5’ apart. Quintus, now an 11th level caster, has cast *spellwarded**zone*on a 20’ diameter sphere centered on himself. He, Marcus, and Balbus are all standing in the *zone*but Viktir is 5’ outside its perimeter. Ramses-Ra calls down a 14th level *fireball*with a 20’ diameter area of effect that strikes the area where Viktir, Balbus, and Marcus are standing. The *spellward*is triggered, but Viktir will not benefit from its protection.

If the triggering effect allows for a saving throw, one layer of the *spellward* will be automatically expended to provide a +1d4 bonus to the saving throw for the affected area and/or any creature(s) in the area.

EXAMPLE: Ramses-Ra has brought down a 14th level *fireball*on Viktir, Balbus, and Marcus. It deals 50 fire damage! However, Balbus and Marcus are in a *spellwarded**zone* with 11 layers.The *spellward*is triggered, and one of its layers is automatically expended to provides a +1d4 bonus to Balbus and Marcus’s saving throws. The die roll is a 3, so both Balbus and Marcus get a +3 bonus to their save. Balbus succeeds, but Marcus rolls badly and fails despite the bonus. Viktir, meanwhile, does not get the bonus, but he manages a lucky roll of 19 and succeeds anyway. The *fireball*will deal 50 fire damage to Marcus and 25 fire damage to Balbus and Viktir.

If the triggering effect deals damage, one layer of the *spellward*will be automatically expended for every 5 points of damage the effect deals (ignore any reduction from saving throws), up to the maximum number of layers. Each layer expended reduces the damage by 1d4 points. If the damage is reduced to 0 or less by the *spellward*, then any creature(s) in the area are entirely unharmed, and do not suffer an interruption of concentration or other effects that may accrue upon being hit.

EXAMPLE: Ramses-Ra’s *fireball*is dealing 50 fire damage. Therefore (50/5) 10 layers of the *spellward*are automatically expended in order to reduce the damage by 10d4 points. The dice roll results in 30 points of damage reduction. Balbus, whose save succeeded, therefore takes no damage. Marcus, whose save failed, takes (50-30) 20 fire damage. Viktir, whose save succeeded, takes 25 fire damage because he is outside the *spellwarded**zone*.

If the *spellwarded* *zone* is subjected to *counterspell* or *dispel magic* spell, it will expend one layer of the ward per two caster levels of the dispel in order to increase its effective caster level by 1d4 per layer, making it harder to dispel the *zone*. *Spellward**zone* expires when all of the layers are expended, or after 6 turns, whichever comes first. If this spell is made *permanent* through ritual magic, the *spellward* recharges two layers per turn.

###### Sphere of Invulnerability, Greater

Arcane 6 , Divine 6 Type: protection

Range: self Duration: 1 round/caster level

This spell is identical to the 4th level spell *lesser**sphere**of**invulnerability*, except that it prevents up to 4th level spells or spell effects from penetrating.

###### Sphere of Invulnerability, Lesser

Arcane 4 , Divine 4 Type: protection

Range: self Duration: 1 round/caster level

This spell creates a magical sphere of protection in a 5’ radius around the caster which prevents any 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level spells or spell effects from penetrating. The area of effect of any such spells will exclude the area protected by the *sphere*. However, 4th and higher level spells are not affected by the *sphere*. *Lesser**sphere**of**invulnerability*does not restrict spells from being cast out,and these spells can pass from the caster through the *sphere*and to their target freely. A *lesser**sphere**of**invulnerability*can be **dispelled** normally.

###### Spider Climbing

Arcane 1 Type: transmogrification

Range: touch Duration: 3 turns

This spell grants its recipient the ability to climb sheer surfaces. If the recipient is not proficient in Climbing, he gains the Climbing proficiency for the duration of the spell.

If the recipient is already proficient in Climbing, he gains the ability to climb utterly unimpeded across vertical surfaces and to hang upside down from ceilings. The recipient can climb at his combat movement rate. He can attack with a tiny, small, or medium weapon, cast spells, and defend himself normally, but cannot charge or run while climbing.

In either case, the recipient must have at least three limbs (hands and feet) free but needs no climbing gear or handholds.

###### Spirit of Healing

Divine 4 Type: healing

Range: 90’ Duration: 1 round/caster level

This spell creates a divine force that may be used to heal a recipient of 1d6+1 damage each round. The *spirit of healing*may continue to heal the same creature on subsequent rounds, or it may be directed to heal another creature instead. The caster must concentrate for the duration of the spell. If the caster loses concentration, the *spirit**of**healing*vanishes and the spell ends.

As with other **cure** spells, the *spirit**of**healing*may be used to cure a creature of paralysis in lieu of curing any damage, and the spell will never increase a creature’s hit points beyond the normal amount.

###### Spiritwalk

Divine 5 Type: esoteric, transmogrification

Range: self Duration: 1 hour/caster level

The spell places the caster into a deep trance, during which his body becomes **helpless** but his spirit can walk free of his body. The caster must be man-sized or smaller when he casts this spell or it fails to work.

The caster’s spirit resembles his body, but is slightly translucent and entirely incorporeal. The spirit appears as if dressed in whatever armor or clothing the caster was wearing when the spell was cast, though this is purely cosmetic. The caster’s spirit cannot affect corporeal creatures or objects unless using spells. It cannot benefit from, carry, use, or wear items. The spirit cannot see into, hear sounds from, or move through an area warded by an *anti-magic sphere*or *holy**circle* or similar effect. Except for these limitations, the spirit can see, hear, speak, move, cast spells, and otherwise act as if it were the caster. The spirit can freely pass through solid objects without difficulty, though it cannot see through them. The caster’s spirit has the same number of hit points as the caster’s body at the time of casting, but thereafter body and spirit are damaged separately. If the caster’s spirit is reduced to 0 hp, the spirit is destroyed. Fortunately, because it is incorporeal, the caster’s spirit can only be damaged by magic weapons or by spells or effects dealing extraordinary damage. If the caster himself has natural weapons in his physical form, the caster’s spirit possesses those natural weapons as well; they deal extraordinary damage to incorporeal targets but cannot harm corporeal targets.

Once a *spiritwalk* begins, it continues until the caster’s spirit returns to his body, the caster’s spirit is destroyed, the caster’s body is slain, or the spell is **dispelled**. The caster can voluntarily return his spirit to his body at the start of his initiative. When the spirit and body reunite, any damage the spirit has suffered is dealt to the body as well. If the *spiritwalking* character’s spirit is destroyed, or if the spell expires before the caster’s soul has returned, his body falls into a catatonic slumber that can only be lifted with *restore**life**and**limb*,*resurrection*, *miracle*, or *wish*. If the *spiritwalking* character’s body is destroyed, the character dies at the end of the *spiritwalk*.

###### Spiritual Weapon

Divine 2 Type: blast, esoteric

Range: 45’ Duration: 1 round/level

This spell causes a weapon made of pure force to spring into existence, attacking any foe chosen by the divine spellcaster within range once per round. It deals 1d6 extraordinary luminous damage per strike, +1 point per three caster levels (maximum of +4). It uses the caster’s normal attack throws. If the *spiritual**weapon* goes beyond the spell range, the caster loses sight of it, or the caster ceases to direct it, the weapon disappears. The weapon cannot be attacked or harmed by physical attacks, but can be **dispelled** or **disintegrated**. The *spiritual**weapon* will be of a type appropriate to the caster and his deity.

###### Strength of Mind\*

Divine 5 Type: protection

Range: touch Duration: 12 turns

This spell grants the recipient creature touched a +4 bonus to its Death, Implements, Paralysis, and Spells saving throw.

The reverse spell, *weakness**of**mind,* decreases the target creature touched a -4 penalty to its Death, Implements, Paralysis, and Spells saving throws. No saving throw is allowed against *weakness**of**mind*.

###### Strengthen the Unliving

Arcane 3 , Divine 3 Type: necromancy

Range: 45’ Duration: 1 turn

This spell strengthens one or more undead creatures within range. The caster can strengthen a number of Hit Dice of undead equal to his caster level. Each strengthened undead gains 1d10 temporary hit points + 1 additional temporary hp per caster level. These temporary hit points will be the first lost if any damage is suffered, but cannot be regained through healing magic, and will disappear at the expiration of the spell’s duration.

###### Striking

Divine 3 Type: transmogrification

Range: 45’ Duration: 3 turns

This spell imbues one weapon within range the ability to deal 1d6 additional extraordinary luminous or necrotic damage. This extra damage is applied on each successful attack for the duration of the spell. It provides no bonus to attack throws, but if cast on a normal weapon, the spell allows the weapon to damage creatures that are immune to physical damage. Only the 1d6 points of extraordinary luminous damage applies to such a monster, however.

###### Sudden Staircase

Arcane 2 Type: wall

Range: 360’ Duration: 1 turn

This spell conjures a staircase of arcane energy into existence. The *sudden staircase*must begin in contact with the ground, or a structure on the ground, and must be solidly supported at both its origin and terminus point. The dimensions of the individual steps can be at most 1’ tall and 5’ wide. The dimensions of the *sudden**staircase* as a whole depend on whether the caster conjures a straight, u-shaped, or spiraling staircase:

* If straight, the staircase can be as large as 250’ long and 5’ wide with a rise of up to 250’ over its length.
* If u-shaped, the staircase can be as small as 15’ long and 10’ wide with a rise of up to 180’ over its length, or as large as 200’ and 10’ wide with a rise of up to 200’.
* If spiraling, the staircase can be as small as 5’ in radius while retaining a rise of up to 250’ over its length. However, the steps are so narrow and wedge-shaped that speeds up or down the spiraling staircase are reduced by half.

The *sudden**staircase* can be conjured at any point within the spell’s range, but the entire length and rise of the staircase must be in range. The caster cannot evoke the *sudden**staircase* such that it appears on or on top of creatures. The *sudden**staircase*lasts until *disintegrated* or **dispelled** or until one turn elapses, whichever comes first.

###### Summon Hellhounds

Arcane 3 Type: summoning

Range: 10’ Duration: 1 month

This spell summons 2 **lesser hellhounds** from the Elemental Sphere of Fire to do the caster’s bidding (see the ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual*** for details). The number of hellhounds summoned is increased to 3 if the caster is 9th level, 4 if the caster is 12th level or higher, and 5 if 14th level or higher. The hellhounds appear anywhere within range and act on their own initiative each round thereafter. When the hellhounds are summoned, the caster must task them with a single objective, such as guarding a location or hunting down a particular creature. The task must be stated aloud, though it can stated in any language he speaks. The spell expires when this task is completed or one month elapses, whichever comes first. Hellhounds are hateful, evil creatures who wish to see the world burn, and they will always interpret their orders in order to maximize the destruction they can inflict. The hellhounds will vanish when destroyed or **dispelled** or when the spell expires. This complex invocation requires one turn to cast, and because of its soul-blasting nature, it cannot be cast more than once per week.

###### Summon Insect Plague

Divine 5 Type: summoning (summons)

Range: 30’ Duration: 1 day

This spell summons a plague of **insect swarms** from the dark places of the earth (see the ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual*** for details). The insect swarms collectively have a number of Hit Dice equal to twice the caster’s level; each individual insect swarm has 2 HD. For instance, a 14th level caster will summon 14 2 HD swarms. Each swarm occupies a 20’ x 10’ area. The insect swarms form anywhere within range and act on their own initiative each round thereafter.

The caster can give verbal orders to the swarms when they arrive and thereafter as an action in lieu of moving anytime the swarms are in line of sight. Orders can be given in any language the caster speaks. The swarms will mindlessly obey whatever orders they are given to the best of their ability. They cannot accomplish tasks that require abstract thought or higher reasoning. If the swarms complete all of their orders, or for whatever reason are physically unable to obey their orders, they will simply remain stationary until they receive new orders. The insect swarms will vanish when destroyed or **dispelled**, or when the spell expires. This complex invocation requires one turn to cast, and because of its soul-blasting nature, it cannot be cast more than once per day.

###### Summon Insect Swarm

Arcane 2 Type: summoning (summons)

Range: 10’ Duration: 1 day

This spell summons one or more **insect swarms** from the dark places of the earth (see the ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual*** for details). The insect swarms collectively have a number of Hit Dice equal to caster level; each individual insect swarm has 2 HD. For instance, a 6th level caster will summon three 2 HD swarms. Excess HD are lost. Each swarm occupies a 10’ x 10’ area. The insect swarms form anywhere within range and act on their own initiative each round thereafter. The caster can give verbal orders to the swarms in the same manner described for *summon insect plague*. The insect swarms will vanish when destroyed or **dispelled**, or when the spell expires. This complex invocation requires one turn to cast, and because of its soul-blasting nature, it cannot be cast more than once per day.

###### Summon Invisible Stalker

Arcane 6 Type: summoning

Range: 10’ Duration: indefinite

This spell summons an **invisible stalker** from the Outer Darkness to do his bidding (see the ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual*** for details). The invisible stalker can be summoned anywhere within range and acts on its own initiative each round thereafter. When the invisible stalker is summoned, the caster must task it with a single objective, such as guarding a location or hunting down a particular creature. The task must be stated aloud, though it can be stated in any language he speaks. The spell expires when this task is completed or one month elapses, whichever comes first. However, invisible stalkers resent protracted missions and complex tasks and will seek to pervert their instructions accordingly. The invisible stalker will vanish when destroyed or **dispelled** or when the spell expires. Because of the soul-blasting nature of this spell, it requires one turn (10 minutes) to cast, and cannot be cast more than once per week.

###### Summon Manes

Arcane 1 Type: summoning (summons)

Range: 45’ Duration: 1 day

This spell summons one **manes** per level of experience to serve the caster (see the ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual*** for details). The manes appear anywhere within range and act on their own initiative each round thereafter. The caster can give verbal orders to the manes when they arrive and thereafter as an action in lieu of moving anytime they are in line of sight. Orders can be given in any language the caster speaks. The spirits will obey whatever orders they are given to the best of their ability. If the manes complete all of their orders, or for whatever reason are physically unable to obey their orders, they will return to the caster to receive new orders. The manes vanish when destroyed or **dispelled**, or when the spell expires. This complex invocation requires one turn to cast, and because of its taxing nature, it cannot be cast more than once per day.

###### Summon Ooze

Arcane 5 Type: summoning (summons)

Range: 10’ Duration: 1 day

This spell summons the caster’s choice of a **gelatinous mass**, **grey goo**, **mustard mold,** or **sage slime** from the dark places of the earth (see the ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual***for details). The summoned ooze appears anywhere within range and act on its own initiative each round thereafter. The caster can give verbal orders to the ooze when it arrives and thereafter as an action in lieu of moving anytime the ooze is in line of sight. Orders can be given in any language the caster speaks. The ooze will mindlessly obey whatever orders it is given to the best of its (limited) ability. It cannot accomplish tasks that require abstract thought or higher reasoning. If the ooze completes all of its orders, or for whatever reason is physically unable to obey its orders, it will move to consume the nearest target edible to it. The summoned ooze will vanish when destroyed or **dispelled**, or when the spell expires. This complex invocation requires one turn to cast, and because of its soul-blasting nature, it cannot be cast more than once per day.

###### Summon Shadow

Arcane 4 Type: summoning (summons)

Range: 10’ Duration: 1 week

This spell summons a **shadow** from the Outer Darkness to serve him (see the ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual*** for details). The shadow appears anywhere within range and act on its own initiative each round thereafter. The caster can give verbal orders to the shadow when it arrives and thereafter as an action in lieu of moving anytime the shadow is in line of sight. Orders can be given in any language the caster speaks. The summoned shadow will obey the caster’s orders. However, shadows are hateful creatures inimical to all life, and will always attempt to twist the meaning of their orders to wreak as much evil as possible. More than one spellcaster has seen friends and lovers damned by the depredations of such minions. The shadow will vanish when destroyed or **dispelled**, or when the spell expires. This complex invocation requires one turn to cast, and because of its soul-blasting nature, it cannot be cast more than once per week.

###### Summon Weather

Arcane 5, Divine 6 Type: elemental (air), esoteric

Range: special Duration: 1 week

This spell summons weather to the spellcaster’s location, changing the temperature, precipitation, and wind in a three-mile radius around the caster (one 6-mile hex on a regional map). The summoned weather must be of a natural and routine type that regularly occurs in that location at that time of year. The spell is usually employed to endweather conditions that are unnatural or extraordinary for the location and time. For instance, the caster might summon a rainstorm to relieve an unseasonable drought with rain, or might summon a warm and cloudless sky to bring an end to an unusually severe thunderstorm. Freak weather (such as snow in summer) cannot be summoned. Natural disasters (such as blizzards, hurricanes, typhoons, or tornados) can be summoned but only in locations and at times where they occur regularly and the caster has no control over the exact manifestation of the disaster. For instance, a caster in “tornado country” could summon a tornado, but he could not control exactly where it appeared and what path it took. This complex spell requires one turn to cast, and the summoned weather gradually arrives over the course of the turn. See p. XX for further rules on weather.

**Designer’s Note:** If the Judge is using the weather rules found in the ***ACKS II Judges Journal****,* in which weather is set with a roll of 2d6 for temperature, precipitation, and wind, then this spell allows the caster to choose the result for each instead of rolling.

###### Summon Winged Herald

Divine 6 Type: summoning (summons)

Range: 10’ Duration: Sunrise

The caster summons a 13 HD **herald** **angel** from the Empyrean Heaven to aid the faith (see the ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual*** for details). This might invocation can only be cast once per week and requires a full turn to cast. The caster must be in a sacrosanct pinnacle of good devoted to the Empyrean gods. When the spell is complete, the herald angel arrives somewhere within range, usually at the altar, apex, or other majestic center of the pinnacle of good.

The herald angel acts on its own initiative. As a great-souled champion of Law, it will assist the caster in the pursuit of great deeds that serve and protect civilization. It will not pursue tasks that its deems beneath its majesty, nor courses of action that are motivated by greed or malice or that work towards Chaotic or even Neutral ends. Any such requests will cause the herald angel to vanish. If the herald angel ever learns or even believes the caster is in violation of his code of behavior, or that the caster or his allies are not allies of Law, the angel also vanishes. Otherwise, the herald angel will vanish when destroyed or **dispelled** or at the next sunrise.

By tradition, the spell is cast at dawn to maximize the available duration, but there is no penalty (save the shorter duration) if the caster summons the herald angel in the afternoon, evening, or night.

###### Sunder Structure

Arcane 4 Type: blast, elemental (earth)

Range: touch Duration: instantaneous

The spell can obliterate a target structure such as a bridge, cliff, tower, or wall. The caster must make a melee attack throw against the structure’s AC (typically 2 for wooden and 6 for stone structures) using a staff or similar weapon. If the attack throw succeeds, the target structure is instantly dealt 250 extraordinary seismic structural damage to stone (enough to destroy one story of a tower or a 30’ length of wall) or 1,250 extraordinary seismic structural damage to wood. Structures with multiple stories have a separate shp per story, and each story must be breached or destroyed separately; destroying a lower story will destroy all upper stories, however. If the target structure is destroyed, each creature on or wIthin it must make a Blast saving throw. If the save fails, the creature suffers 5d6 bludgeoning damage from collapsing rubble. If the save succeeds, the creature suffers half that damage.

###### Sunflare

Arcane 2 , Divine 4 Type: blast, elemental (fire)

Range: 180’Duration: instantaneous

This spell calls down a column of sunfire 40’ in height and 20’ in diameter at a target point. Each creature within the area of effect must make a Blast saving throw. If the save fails, the creature suffers 3d6 extraordinary luminous fire damage. If the save succeeds, the creature suffers half that damage. *Sunflare* deals double damage against undead creatures.

The*sunflare* can also damage structures in its area of effect. It deals up to 3d6 extraordinary luminous fire structural damage to wooden structures and one-third that damage to stone structures. (It might deal less if the structure is not entirely in its area of effect.) The *sunflare* causes combustibles to ignite.

Because it relies on the power of the sun, this spell can only be cast if the caster is standing in direct sunlight. If this spell is targeted at a point indoors or underground, the *sunflare* will strike the ceiling or surface above the desired area of effect. If the damage caused to an interposing barrier shatters or breaks through it, the *sunflare* will continue beyond the barrier in order to attain its full volume.

###### Swift Sword

Divine 2 Type: movement

Range: self Duration: 6 rounds

This spell accelerates the attacks of the caster, allowing her to make one additional attack per round for the duration of the spell. Movement and spellcasting are not accelerated, nor is the use of magic items such as wands, which may still be used just once per round. Multiple speed effects don’t combine; only apply the most powerful or longest lasting effect.

###### Swift Sword, Sustained

Divine 3 Type: movement

Range: self Duration: 3 turns

This spell accelerates the attacks of the caster, allowing her to make one additional attack per round for the duration of the spell. Movement and spellcasting are not accelerated, nor is the use of magic items such as wands, which may still be used just once per round. Multiple speed effects don’t combine; only apply the most powerful or longest lasting effect.

###### Swimming

Arcane 2 Type: elemental (water), transmogrification

Range: touch Duration: 6 turns + 1 turn/caster level

The recipient of this spell gains the ability to swim on the surface or underwater at a combat speed of 20’ per round and an encounter speed of 60’ per turn. The recipient must have at least three limbs (hands and feet) free to swim. While swimming, the recipient can charge or run, attack, cast spells, defend itself normally. This spell does notgrant the ability to breathe underwater. The recipient must be man-sized or smaller when this spell is cast or it fails to work.

###### Sword of Fire

Divine 5 Type: elemental (fire), esoteric, transmogrification

Range: self Duration: 12 turns

On casting this spell, a *sword of fire* appears in the caster’s hand. The sword can be used in melee like any ordinary sword, but it grants a +3 bonus to attack throws and deals 1d6+3 extraordinary luminous fire damage. If the caster is 12th caster level or higher, the bonus to attack throws and damage is increased to +4. The *sword of fire* can be dual-wielded with another weapon (even another *sword of fire*) or used with a shield, but cannot be wielded two-handed. The spell does not grant the caster any weapon or fighting style proficiencies, however. The caster can cause the sword to appear and disappear at will without taking an action, enabling him to cast spells and carry out other activities.

###### Telekinesis

Arcane 5 Type: movement

Range: 180’ Duration: 1 turn per level

This spell can enable the caster to move a target creature or object of up to a specified weight in any direction through the air within range. (If the caster is the recipient, the range is measured from his location when he casts the spell.) The caster can telekinetically move up to 6 stone per caster level.

If the caster targets a willing recipient, an unattended object, or an object possessed by a willing creature, the spell automatically moves the target. If the caster targets an unwilling creature, or an object possessed by an unwilling creature, the creature must make a Spells saving throw. If the save fails, the target can be moved. If the save succeeds, the target cannot be moved this round, but the caster can try again on the same or another target on his next initiative.

To move the affected creature or object, the caster must concentrate. The concentrating caster can move the affected creature up to 20’ in any direction each round on the caster’s initiative, including on the round he cast the spell. The caster does not need to maintain concentration to sustain the spell. For instance, he can concentrate for one round to move the recipient 20’ up, take another action the following round, and then resume moving the recipient the subsequent round. The caster can change the target of *telekinesis* on each round that he concentrates, if desired. However, if he stops moving an unwilling creature, then wants to move the creature again later, the creature receives a new saving throw to resist being moved.

If the affected creature or object is up in the air, and either the duration expires, the spell is **dispelled**, the affected creature or object is loaded beyond what the caster can telekinetically support, or the caster begins concentrating on a new target, the affected creature or objectwill immediately plummet from the air.

###### Telepathy

Arcane 4 Type: detection, esoteric

Range: 180’ Duration: 1 turn

This spell can enable the spellcaster to engage in direct mind-to-mind communication with other sapient creatures without need for a shared language. When the spell is cast, the caster can request a telepathic link with a target sapient creature. The target “feels” its mind being “touched.” The target can either accept the telepathic link or attempt to refuse it. If the target accepts the link, it is automatically established. If the target attempts to refuse the link, it must make a Spells saving throw. If the save fails, the link is established despite its refusal. If the save succeeds, the link is not established.

Once the link is established, the caster can read all of the target’s surface thoughts and can send thoughts of his own to the target. Note that this is asymmetrical: the caster can read what target is thinking, even if the target doesn’t want him to, while target can only read what the caster chooses to send.

Since telepathy only allows the caster to read the target’s surface thoughts, the target’s deeply held secrets, private concerns, or suppressed memories cannot usually be accessed with telepathy unless they are somehow brought to the surface of the target’s mind. A clever caster might transmit cues, reminders, or triggers to try to bring certain thoughts to the surface, or might even have a nearby accomplice provoke the target to expose what it thinks. Such shenanigans are left to the Judge’s discretion to decide.

The caster must maintain stationary concentration to keep a telepathic link active. The caster does not need to maintain concentration to sustain the spell. For instance, he can concentrate for one round to communicate with a target, take another action the following round, and then establish a new link with that or another target on the subsequent round. The caster can change the creature with which he is linked each round that he concentrates, if desired. However, if the caster breaks his telepathic link with an unwilling creature, then wants to link with that creature again later, the creature receives a new saving throw to resist the link.

###### Teleportation

Arcane 5 Type: movement

Range: touch Duration: instantaneous

This spell instantly teleports a target creature, along with whatever it is carrying or wearing, to a destination of the caster’s choice. If the target is willing, it is automatically teleported when touched. If the target is unwilling, it must make a Spells saving throw when touched. If the save fails, the target is teleported. If the save succeeds, the target resists being teleported.

*Teleportation* is notoriously inaccurate and dangerous, and only the desperate or reckless use it often. The chance of the spell working correctly depends on how familiar the caster is with the intended destination. The more familiar the caster, the better the chance of the spell working correctly. For purposes of the spell, there are four degrees of familiarity. The caster is considered **intimately familiar** with places he has regularly inhabited for many years, such as his own residence or his childhood home. The caster is considered **familiar** with places he can currently see or places he has visited repeatedly in recent memory, such as a favorite tavern or place of worship. The caster is considered **somewhat familiar** with places he has personally visited at least twice or scried on for at least an hour. The caster is considered **vaguely familiar** with places he has personally visited just once, has briefly scried, or has only seen rendered in art or by illusion.

To determine how well the teleportation works, roll d% and consult the table below.

Caster Familiarity On Target Off Target Lost

Intimately Familiar 01 – 95 96 – 99 00

Familiar 01 – 80 81 – 90 91 – 00

Somewhat Familiar 01 – 50 51 – 75 76 – 00

Vaguely Familiar 01 – 30 31 – 65 66 – 00

If the result is **On Target**, the teleported creature arrives at the intended destination at ground level in a suitable and open point. If the result is **Off Target**, the teleported creature arrives 1d10 x 10 feet away from the intended destination in a random direction. If this location already be occupied by solid matter, the creature is instantly killed; if this location is above the ground, the creature immediately plummets to earth. If the result is **Lost**, the teleported creature does not arrive at all. Whether such hapless creatures are **disintegrated**, trapped forever in some other sphere of existence, or transported to some distant time and place is a matter of debate among the wise. Under no circumstances can a caster intentionally teleport himself or another creature off target, into thin air, or into solid matter.

###### Thunderbolt

Arcane 3 Type: blast, elemental (air)

Range: 0’ Duration: instantaneous

The caster releases a thunderous blast of electricity that extends 120’ from his outstretched hands. The *thunderbolt* passes through an area 5’ wide, arcing and jumping, so that, while it is not actually 5’ wide, for game purposes treat it as if it is so. Each creature in the area of effect must make a Blast saving throw. If the save fails, the creature suffers 1d6 points of extraordinary electricity damage per caster level and is **deafened** by shock and thunder. If the save succeeds, the creature suffers half that damage but is not deafened.

A deafened creature is easy to sneak up on, and suffers a -2 penalty to surprise rolls. It can be backstabbed by an opponent outside its line of sight as if the creature were **sneaking**. Due to its inability to hear itself, a deafened creature has a -4 penalty on any throws that require vocalization (such as using Magical Music proficiency). The deafened creature can make another saving throw at the end of its initiative each round. If the save succeeds, it is no longer deafened.

The *thunderbolt*can also damage structures in its area of effect. It deals up to 1d6 extraordinary electrical structural damage per caster level to wooden structures and one-third that damage to stone structures. (It might deal less if the structure is not entirely in its area of effect.) If the damage caused to an interposing structure shatters or breaks through it, the bolt may continue beyond the barrier if the spell’s range permits; otherwise, it may reflect from the barrier back towards the caster, or in a random direction at the Judge’s option. Creatures already affected by the *thunderbolt* do not take additional damage if struck by the reflection of the same bolt. A *thunderbolt*is so loud that it can be heard as a low rumble by creatures up to 10 miles away.

###### Thunderclap

Arcane 1 Type: blast, elemental (air)

Range: 90’ Duration: instantaneous

A deafening peal of thunder resounds at a point of the caster’s choice. The *thunderclap* is so loud that it can be heard as a low rumble by creatures up to 10 miles away. Each creature within 5’ of the *thunderclap* must make Blast saving throw. If the save fails, the creature suffers 1d6 extraordinary bludgeoning damage and is **deafened**. If the save succeeds, the creature suffers half that damage but is not deafened (though its ears may ache and ring).

A deafened creature is easy to sneak up on, and suffers a -2 penalty to surprise rolls. It can be backstabbed by an opponent outside its line of sight as if the creature were **sneaking**. Due to its inability to hear itself, a deafened creature has a -4 penalty on any throws that require vocalization (such as a using Magical Music proficiency). The deafened creature can make another saving throw at the end of its initiative each round. If the save succeeds, it is no longer deafened.

###### Tongues\*

Divine 4 Type: detection, esoteric

Range: 90’ Duration: 1 turn

This spell grants the caster the ability to speak and understand the language of any intelligent creature within range.

The reverse, *garble*, can be cast on an intelligent living target within range. No saving throw is permitted. If the target is the beneficiary of a *tongues*spell, *garble*will negate the *tongues*spell; otherwise, *garble*will render the target unable to speak and understand the languages of other intelligent creatures. While unable to communicate with others, the target may still think clearly and understand his own words, so *garble*does not prevent the target from casting spells. Indeed, the target may not immediately realize he is under the effects of a *garble*– he may think something is wrong with the creatures around him who can’t understand what he’s saying.

###### Torpor

Arcane 6, Divine 6 Type: esoteric, necromancy

Range: touch Duration: indefinite

The caster puts an undead target into a pseudo-sleep of indefinite duration. In order to be placed into *torpor*, the creature must be in its tomb, coffin, sarcophagus, ossuary, or other final resting place. If the target creature is a willing recipient, the torpor automatically occurs when the creature is touched. If the creature is an unwilling target, it must make a Death saving throw when it is touched, and only enters *torpor* on a failure.

While in *torpor*, undead creature such as zombies, mummies, and liches do not suffer physical decay, while hungering undead such as ghouls or vampires do not need to feed. An undead is awakened from *torpor* if its final resting place is disturbed. The caster can set other conditions; a common condition is a particular alignment of the stars or outer planes. An awakened undead may choose to return to *torpor* if it resolves the reason for its awakening within one hour (6 turns) or it may remain awake.

###### Transform Beast

Divine 2 Type: transmogrification

Range: 90’ Duration: perpetual

This spell allows the caster to change a target animal into the form of another animal that is native to his location. The target’s current form cannot be incorporeal, gaseous, or larger than man-sized. If the target animal is a willing recipient, the transformation automatically occurs when the spell is cast. If the animal is an unwilling target, it must make a Spells saving throw when the spell is cast. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect. If the save fails, the creature is transformed.

Most animals will be unwilling to be transformed, but if the animal is **bewitched** by the caster, has been befriended by the caster using Beast Friendship or *speak with beasts*, or was personally raised and trained by the caster, the animal will trust the caster enough to count as a willing recipient.

While transformed, the animal gains the physical attributes, capabilities, and attacks of the new form, along with the new form’s mental characteristics, intelligence, behavioral traits, and mentality. The target creature will have the same number of hit points it previously had, regardless of the Hit Dice of the form assumed. The new form will always be of around the same relative age as the original form; a bear cub can be transformed into a wolf puppy or tadpole, but not into a silverback gorilla. The target animal is sterile in its new form and cannot reproduce offspring.

The target animal will but dimly remember its former life, and loses any training it has received, although it remains tame if it was previously and can be re-trained. Unless persuaded otherwise by, e.g. a character with Beast Friendship or *speak with beasts***,** it will simply engage in behavior that is ordinary for its kind for the duration of the spell. The spell is perpetual, lasting until dispelled or the creature is slain or until the caster dies or decides to stop sustaining the spell. When the spell expires, the target (or target’s corpse) reverts to its original form.

Because the form must be native to the caster’s location, the caster cannot transform a rabbit into a dinosaur unless in a “lost world” where such creatures still roam the earth. Likewise, the caster cannot transform a camel into a whale in the middle of the desert, or a polar bear into a lion in the middle of the tundra.

###### Transform Other

Arcane 6 Type: transmogrification

Range: touch Duration: perpetual

This spell allows the caster to change a living target into another form of living creature. The target’s current form cannot be incorporeal, gaseous, or larger than man-sized. The target’s new form can’t have more Hit Dice than caster’s level, must have fewer than twice the Hit Dice of the target’s old form, and cannot have more than one special ability (\*). The target cannot be changed into an incorporeal or gaseous form**,** nor into the form of an enchanted creature. The spell cannot create a duplicate of a specific individual.

If the target creature is a willing recipient, the transformation automatically occurs when the creature is touched. If the creature is an unwilling target, it must make a Spells saving throw when it is touched. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect. If the save fails, the creature is transformed.

While transformed, the target gains the physical capabilities and characteristics, physical attacks, and special abilities of the new form while retaining his own mental abilities (perhaps to his horror). The target creature will have the same number of hit points it previously had, regardless of the Hit Dice of the form assumed. The target creature is sterile in its new form and cannot reproduce offspring. The new form will always be of around the same relative age as the original form.

Creatures with shape changing abilities such as a doppelganger or powerful shaman can revert to their natural form in one round. Otherwise, the spell is perpetual, lasting until dispelled or the creature is slain or until the caster dies or decides to stop sustaining the spell. When the spell expires, the target (or target’s corpse) reverts to its original form.

###### Transform Self

Arcane 6 Type: transmogrification

Range: self Duration: 6 turns + 1 turn/caster level

This spell allows the caster to change into another form of living creature. The assumed form cannot have more Hit Dice than caster level and cannot have more than one special ability (\*). The caster cannot assume an incorporeal or gaseous form, or the form of an enchanted creature, and cannot become a duplicate of a specific individual. If slain, the caster reverts to his original form. The caster must be man-sized or smaller when she casts this spell or it fails to work.

While transformed, the caster gains the physical capabilities and characteristics of the new form while retaining his own mental abilities. He also gains all physical attacks and special abilities possessed by the new form. The caster will have the same number of hit points he previously had, regardless of the Hit Dice of the form assumed. The caster is sterile in his new form and cannot reproduce offspring. The new form will always be of around the same relative age as the original form. The caster can remain transformed for the full duration of the spell, or may choose to end the spell whenever he desires.

###### Trollblood

Arcane 6 Type: transmogrification

Range: self Duration: 1 turn

This spell grants the caster regenerative powers similar to those of a troll. For the duration of the spell, the caster will regenerate 3 damage at the start of his initiative. Even if the caster is reduced below 0 hit points, he will continue to regenerate, and he will be have no need for bed rest if he regenerates to 1 or more hp before the spell expires. If the caster loses a limb or body part to a mortal wound, these parts will attempt to crawl or squirm back towards the main portion of his body to reattach, and can be reattached instantly simply by being held to the stump.

However, only damage taken while under the effect of the spell can be regenerated. The caster does notregenerate from the effects of damage or mortal wounds suffered before the spell was cast. Further, the spell is powerless to regenerate fire damage or acid damage.

The caster must be man-sized or smaller when he casts this spell or it fails to work.

###### True Seeing

Divine 5 Type: detection, esoteric

Range: touch Duration: 1 turn + 1 round/caster level

This spell confers the recipient with the ability to see the world clearly and without obfuscation. The recipient can see through normal and magical darkness, notices any and all secret doors, sees the exact locations of displaced creatures or objects, sees through normal or magical disguises, sees invisible creatures or objects normally, sees through illusions, and sees the true form of transformed creatures or objects, out to a range of 120’.

*True seeing*, however, does not penetrate solid objects. It in no way confers *x***-***ray**vision* or its equivalent. It does not negate concealment, including that caused by fog, rain, or snow. In addition, the spell’s effects cannot be further enhanced with known magic, so the recipient cannot use *true**seeing* through a **crystal ball** or in conjunction with *clairvoyancy*.

###### Turn to Dust

Divine 5 Type: death

Range: 225’Duration: instantaneous

This spell can turn an undead target into dust. The target of the spell must make a Death saving throw. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect. If the save fails, the target is instantly destroyed. Even creatures such as vampires can be destroyed with this powerful spell. *Turn to dust*has no effect on living creatures, constructs, or incarnations.

###### Unliving Puppet

Arcane 1 , Divine 1 Type: necromancy

Range: 90’Duration: concentration

This spell raises the bones or body of a single dead creature within range and line of sight of the caster as an undead skeleton or zombie under the caster’s mental control. An animated skeleton can be created only from a mostly intact skeleton; a zombie can be created only from a mostly intact corpse.

Animated skeletons have Hit Dice equal to the default number of racial Hit Dice such monsters have in life; for skeletons of humans or demi-humans, this means one Hit Die, regardless of the character level of the deceased. Zombies have one more Hit Die than the monsters have in life. Unlike *animate undead*, the HD of the skeleton or zombie created are not limited by caster level. However, only creatures of less than 9 HD can be raised by this spell (though an 8 HD creature might be raised as a 9 HD zombie).

The caster must concentrate to control the *unliving puppet*.The undead cannot be controlled outside the range of the spell. If the caster loses concentration, or the unliving puppet is somehow forced out of range of the caster, the spell ends. Otherwise the *unliving**puppet*remains animated until destroyed or **dispelled**, or until the caster relinquishes concentration. The creatures’ remains crumble to dust when the spell ends.

###### Vigor

Divine 5 Type: transmogrification

Range: touchDuration: 1 turn / caster level

This spell imbues the recipient with divine might and potency. For the duration of the spell, the character gains an additional +2 bonus to attack throws and damage rolls, an additional +8 bonus on Dungeonbashing throws, a +2 bonus to saving throws, and 1d10 temporary hit points. The temporary hit points cannot be restored by healing and are the first lost whenever the character takes damage. The recipient must be man-sized or smaller when this spell is cast or it fails to work. This spell does not otherwise stack with effects that influence strength, but it does stack with the character’s normal bonus or penalty from Strength and with effects that alter size.

###### Vitriolic Infusion

Arcane 2 Type: elemental (water), transmogrification

Range: touch Duration: 1 day

This spell infuses water with concentrated vitriol, transforming it into a highly-damaging *vitriolic infusion*. A single casting will transform six flasks of water. When a flask of *vitriolic**infusion* is thrown, resolve the effects as if it were a flask of burning oil (see p. XX) but dealing acidic rather than fire damage. The magical *infusion* will evaporate in one day if unused. The spell has no effect on creatures of any type, nor upon magic potions, oil, or holy water.

###### Wall of Annihilation

Arcane 6 Type: wall

Range: 180’Duration: perpetual

This spell conjures an invisible *wall**of**annihilation* into existence. Any creature or object that passes through the *wall**of**annihilation* is instantly **disintegrated** with no saving throw. Only a *miracle*or *wish*can restore the victim to life.

The wall is 1’ thick and can be as large as 100 square feet. It must be a flat vertical plane in contact with the ground and bonded to the surrounding material. The caster cannot evoke the wall such that it appears on or on top of creatures or objects. Walls of annihilation are most commonly placed as invisible traps that secure doorways or entrances within a mage’s sanctum.

The *wall of annihilation* is unaffected by normal or magical attacks and invulnerable to physical and magical damage. However, it can be **dispelled**normally, and a *disintegration*spell will destroy it. If not **dispelled** or destroyed, the wall of annihilation is perpetual, lasting until the caster dies or decides to stop sustaining it.

###### Wall of Corpses

Arcane 6 Type: necromancy, wall

Range: 180’Duration: 2 turns

This spell conjures a horrific barrier formed of writhing, animated corpses into existence for the duration of the spell. The *wall of corpses* is 1’ thick and can be as large as 1,200 square feet. It can be shaped in any manner and to any dimensions the caster desires provided the entire wall is within the spell’s range. For instance, it might be a straight wall 120’ long and 10’ high, or a protective circle 10’ high with a 10’ radius. The *wall**of**corpses*cannot be evoked so that it appears where objects or creatures already are.

Upon beholdinga *wall**of**corpses*, creatures must make a Paralysis saving throw. If the saving throw succeeds, the creature is immune to the effects of beholding the *wall.*  If the saving throw fails, the creature begins **faltering.** The condition lasts until the wall is **dispelled** or until the creature no longer beholds the wall. If the creature beholds the wall again, it must save again if not already immune. Any creatures starting their initiative or moving to within 5’ of the wall are attacked as if from a readied attack by a zombie (see the ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual***).

A *counterspell*, *dispel magic,*or a *disintegration*spell can destroy a *wall**of**corpses*immediately. A *wall**of**corpses* can also be damaged by normal or magical attacks dealing damage of any type except necrotic. The wall has AC 4 and 10 hp per caster level, and saves as a fighter of caster level. A crusader or other character capable of turning undead can attempt to turn the wall as if it were an Infernal creature. If the turning throw succeeds, the corpses within lose their animating force, rendering the wall merely an inert, fleshy barrier for the duration of the turning. If the turning throw succeeds with a D (destroyed) result, the wall is instantly destroyed. If not otherwise destroyed or **dispelled**, the wall vanishes in 2 turns.

###### Wall of Flame

Arcane 4 Type: elemental (fire), wall

Range: 180’Duration: 2 turns

This spell conjures an immobile, translucent, *wall of flame* into existence for the duration of the spell. The wall is 1’ thick and can be as large as 1,200 square feet. The caster can form the wall into almost any shape he desires, provided the entire wall is within the spell’s range and it rests on a solid surface. For instance, it might be a straight wall 120’ long and 10’ high, or a protective circle 10’ high with a 10’ radius. However, the caster cannot evoke the wall such that it appears on or on top of creatures or objects. The wall does not block light, movement, or vision. However, any creature passing through the wall suffers 2d6 extraordinary fire damage. A *counterspell*, *disintegration,*or *dispel magic*spell can destroy the *wall of flame*instantly; it will otherwise dissipate in 2 turns.

###### Wall of Force

Arcane 6 Type: wall

Range: 180’Duration: 2 turns

This spell conjures an invisible, impenetrable *wall of force* into existence for the duration of the spell. The wall is 1’ thick and can be as large as 1,200 square feet. The caster can form the wall into almost any shape he desires, provided the entire wall is within the spell’s range. For instance, it might be a straight wall 120’ long and 10’ high, or a protective circle 10’ high with a 10’ radius. However, the caster cannot evoke the wall such that it appears on or on top of creatures or objects. The *wall of force*is totally impenetrable, and is unaffected by normal or magical attacks, fire, cold, lightning, or any other physical or magical effect. A *counterspell* or *dispel magic* will not affect it, but a *disintegration*spell will destroy it.

###### Wall of Frost

Arcane 4 Type: elemental (water), wall

Range: 180’Duration: 2 turns

This spell conjures an immobile, translucent, *wall of frost* into existence for the duration of the spell. The wall is 1’ thick and can be as large as 1,200 square feet. The caster can form the wall into almost any shape he desires, provided the entire wall is within the spell’s range and it rests on a solid surface. For instance, it might be a straight wall 120’ long and 10’ high, or a protective circle 10’ high with a 10’ radius. However, the caster cannot evoke the wall such that it appears on or on top of creatures or objects. The wall does not block light, movement, or vision. However, any creature passing through the wall suffers 2d6 extraordinary cold damage. A *counterspell*, *disintegration,*or *dispel**magic* spell can destroy the *wall of frost*instantly; it will otherwise dissipate in 2 turns.

###### Wall of Smoke

Arcane 1 Type: elemental (air), wall

Range: 180’Duration: 1 turn

This spell conjures an immobile, opaque, wall of billowing smoke into existence for the duration of the spell. The wall is normally 1’ thick and can be as large as 1,000 square feet. The wall can be made thicker than 1’ with a proportionate reduction in area, but it cannot be made less than 1’ thick. The caster can form the wall into almost any shape he desires, provided the entire wall is within the spell’s range. However, the caster cannot evoke the wall such that it appears on or on top of creatures or objects.

The *wall of smoke* is impermeable to vision and light, but presents no obstacle to movement or magical effects except for those requiring a line of sight to target. Once created, the *wall of smoke*can be affected by water or strong winds like an ordinary cloud of smoke, though other attacks will have correspondingly little effect on it. A *counterspell, disintegration,*or *dispel magic*spell can destroy the *wall of smoke*instantly; it will otherwise dissipate in 1 turn.

###### Wall of Stone

Arcane 5 Type: elemental (earth), wall

Range: 180’Duration: perpetual

This spell conjures a stone wall into existence. The wall is normally 1’ thick and can be as large as 1,000 square feet. The wall can be made thicker than 1’ with a proportionate reduction in area, but cannot be made less than 1’ thick. The caster can form the wall into almost any dimensions and shape he desires provided the entire wall is within the spell’s range. However, the caster cannot evoke the wall such that it appears on or on top of creatures or objects. The wall created need not be vertical, nor rest upon any firm foundation; however, it must merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. It can be used to bridge a chasm, for instance, or as a ramp. For this use, if the span is more than 20’, the wall must be arched and buttressed. This requirement reduces the spell’s area by half. The wall can be crudely shaped to allow crenellations, battlements, and so forth by likewise reducing the area. The wall is perpetual, lasting until destroyed, **disintegrated**, or **dispelled**, or until the caster dies or decides to stop sustaining the spell.

###### Wall of Thunder

Arcane 3 Type: elemental (air), wall

Range: 120’Duration: concentration

This spell conjures a wall of thunderous lightning and violent winds. The *wall of thunder* is 1’ thick and can be as large as 500 square feet. It can be almost any shape the caster desires, provided the entire wall is within the spell’s range and the bottom of the wall is in contact with the ground. The caster cannot evoke the wall that it appears on or on top of creatures or objects.

Any creatures that start their initiative or move within 5’ of the wall are subject to attack as if from a readied 2 HD monster. If the attack hits, the creature suffers 1d6 extraordinary electric damage. Any creature passing through the wall automatically suffers 2d6 extraordinary electric damage.

The wall does not block light, movement, or vision. It cannot be affected by physical or magical attacks and is invulnerable to physical and magical damage. If not destroyed, **dispelled**, or **disintegrated**, the *wall* remains so long as the caster maintain concentration on it. The concentrating caster can move the wall along the ground up to 20’ in any desired direction in range on his initiative each round.

Because *wall of thunder* draws its power from atmospheric winds, it can only be cast outdoors or in a well-ventilated room. It is primarily used during battles. An 8.25’ tall, 60’ wide *wall of thunder* can badly injure an entire company of troops by moving through them.

###### Wall of Wood

Arcane 4 Type: elemental (earth), wall

Range: 180’Duration: perpetual

This spell conjures a wooden wall into existence. The wall is normally 1” thick and can be as large as 1,200 square feet. The wall can be made thicker than 1” with a proportionate reduction in area, but cannot be made less than 1” thick. The caster can create a *wall**of**wood* in almost any shape he desires provided the entire wall is within the spell’s range. However, the caster cannot evoke the wall such that it appears on or on top of creatures or objects. The wall created need not be vertical, but must rest upon a firm foundation. It can be used to bridge a chasm, for instance, or as a ramp, but the wall must be shaped properly, reducing the spell’s area by half. Likewise, the wall can be crudely shaped to form battlements and ramparts by reducing the area. The wall is perpetual, lasting until destroyed, **disintegrated**, or **dispelled**, or until the caster dies or decides to stop sustaining the spell.

###### Warp Wood

Arcane 2 Type: blast, elemental (earth)

Range: 360’ Duration: instantaneous

This spell causes every small wooden object within a 20’ diameter sphere to be bent into a clumsy, twisted, uneven shape. It can affect arrows, bows, clubs, shields, spears, staffs, wands, and other non-structural wooden object weighing 1 stone or less, but not wooden creatures, doors, vessels, vehicles, or structures. Non-magical wooden objects are automatically warped to the point of uselessness. Magical wooden objects might resist the effect. If the object is held by a creature, the creature can make a Death saving throw, adding the weapon’s magic bonus (if any) to the save. If the object is not being held by a creature, the object must make a Death saving throw as a fighter of a level equal to its magic bonus. (Count staffs and wands as having a bonus equal to one-half their caster level.) If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect. If the save fails, the object is ruined. The spell causes no harm to the creature holding the weapon (except for depriving him of it).

###### Water Breathing

Arcane 3, Divine 3 Type: elemental (water), transmogrification

Range: 45’Duration: 1 day

This spell allows the recipient to breathe underwater at any depth. It does not prevent the recipient from breathing air, nor does it provide any special ability to move underwater. The recipient must be man-sized or smaller when the spell is cast or it fails to work.

###### Water Walking

Divine 3 Type: elemental (water), movement

Range: 45’Duration: 6 turns + 1 turn/caster level

This spell allows the recipient to walk on water as if it were solid, dry land. While walking on water, the recipient can still attack creatures in or beneath the surface of the water, but cannot swim or submerge itself without ending the spell effect. The caster must be man-sized or smaller when the spell is cast or it fails to work.

###### Weave Fire

Arcane 3 Type: elemental (fire), wall

Range: 180’Duration: 2 turns

This spell allows the caster to manipulate an existing volume of fire into a different shape. In order to weave fire the caster must concentrate. The concentrating caster can move up to 1,000 cubic feet of fire by up to 100’ each combat round. The caster does not need to maintain concentration to sustain the spell. For instance, he can concentrate for one round to weave fire, take another action the following round, and then resume weaving fire subsequent round.

The caster cannot weave fire carried or held by creatures or in which there are creatures already, nor can he weave it to impact creatures. He cannot affect a carried torch, for instance, nor can he weave fire straight into an enemy. In addition, the fire cannot be woven to be less than 1” thick and it must eventually merge with the fire’s kindling source. Subject to those limitations, the caster can weave the fire into almost any shape he desires. If the caster has a relevant Art or Craft proficiency, he can even weave the fire into fiery sculptures with intricate detail. When the spell expires, the fire sputters out wherever there is not appropriate fuel, and thereafter burns as a natural fire.

If woven to at least 6” thickness, woven fire will block vision, and if woven to 1’ thickness, it will block both vision and light. Due to the enchantments placed up on it, the woven fire is impenetrable to monsters with fewer than 5 HD. Monsters with 5 or more HD suffer 1d6 extraordinary fire damage if they pass through the fire. *Weave fire*does not create the fire itself, so it must be cast on a bonfire, forest fire, etc.

###### Weave Smoke

Arcane 1 Type: elemental (air), wall

Range: 180’Duration: 2 turns

This spell allows the caster to manipulate an existing volume of fog and/or smoke into a different shape. In order to weave smoke the caster must concentrate. The concentrating caster can move up to 1,000 cubic feet of smoke by up to 100’ each combat round. The caster does not need to maintain concentration to sustain the spell. For instance, he can concentrate for one round to weave smoke, take another action the following round, and then resume weaving fire subsequent round.

The caster cannot weave the smoke so that it appears where objects or creatures already are, nor can he weave it to impact creatures. In addition, the smoke cannot be woven to be less than 1” thick. Subject to those limitations, the caster can weave the smoke into almost any shape he desires. If the caster has a relevant Art or Craft proficiency, he can even weave the smoke into decorative sculptures with intricate detail. If woven to at least 6” thickness, woven smoke will block vision, and if woven to 1’ thickness, it will block both vision and light. Smoke never presents an obstacle to movement or magical effects (except for those requiring a line of sight to target, of course). Once woven, the smoke can still be affected by water or strong winds like an ordinary cloud of smoke, though other attacks will have correspondingly little effect on it. A *counterspell*, *disintegration,*or *dispel magic* spell can disperse the woven smoke instantly; it will otherwise dissipate in 1 turn. The spell does not create the smoke itself, so it must be cast on morning mist, banks of fog, smoke from a fire, etc.

###### Weave Water

Arcane 4 Type: elemental (water), wall

Range: 180’Duration: 2 turns

This spell allows the caster to manipulate an existing volume of water into a different shape. In order to weave fire the caster must concentrate. The concentrating caster can move up to 1,200 cubic feet of water by up to 120’ each combat round. The caster does not need to maintain concentration to sustain the spell. For instance, he can concentrate for one round to weave water, take another action the following round, and then resume weaving water subsequent round.

The caster cannot weave water carried or held by creatures or in which there are creatures already, nor can he weave it to impact creatures. In addition, the water cannot be woven to be less than 1” thick and it must eventually merge with the existing water source. Subject to those limitations, the caster can weave the water into almost any shape he desires. If the caster has a relevant Art or Craft proficiency, he can even weave the water into flowing sculptures with intricate detail. When the spell expires, the weaving collapses spectacularly and the water returns to its natural shape.

If woven to at least 6” thickness, woven water will block vision, and if woven to 1’ thickness, it will block both vision and light. Due to the enchantments placed up on it, the woven water is impenetrable to monsters with fewer than 5 HD. Monsters with 5 or more HD suffer 1d6 extraordinary cold damage if they pass through the water. *Weave water*does not create the water itself, so it must be cast on a fountain, lake, river, etc.

###### Webbing

Arcane 2 Type: esoteric, wall

Range: 10’Duration: 48 turns

This spell creates a many-layered mass of strong, sticky strands covering an area 10’ x 10’ x 10’. Creatures caught within the *webbing* when it appears become **webbed** by the gluey fibers. Creatures that attack targets in the *webbing* with weapons do not become restrained, but creatures that attack targets in the *webbing* with natural weapons or that move into the *webbing* do. Incorporeal creatures can ignore the *webbing* as if it were not there.

Webbed creatures cannot move, but can still attack, cast spells, take actions in lieu of attacking or moving, or attempt to escape. While webbed, the is **vulnerable** and can be ambushed or backstabbed by creatures capable of doing so.

Attempting to escape from the webbing is an action in lieu of attacking. The creature can attempt to slip free or break free. Slipping free requires a Paralysis saving throw. If the creature has Contortionism proficiency, it gains a +4 bonus on the throw. If the save succeeds, the creature escapes. If the save fails, the creature gets more entangled in the webs and becomes **helpless**.

Breaking free requires a Dungeonbashing proficiency throw at -9. If the throw succeeds, the creature escapes. If the throw fails, the creature remains webbed (but does not become helpless). Large creatures gain a +4 bonus, huge creatures gain a +8 bonus, gigantic creatures gain a +12 bonus, and colossal creatures gain a +16 bonus on the throw.

Webbed creatures can free themselves, and webbed creatures can be freed, by cutting the webbing or setting it aflame. Cutting webbing off a creature is an attack and requires a successful attack throw vs. AC 4 with a weapon dealing extraordinary slashing damage. If the attack throw succeeds, the creature is no longer webbed. Setting fire to the webbing is an attack and requires an attack throw against AC 0 with the fire source. If the attack succeeds, the webs instantly go up in flames. All creatures in the webbing immediately take 1d8 mundane fire damage at the start of their initiative until they escape the webbing. The webbing burns away at the end of two rounds.

###### Winged Flight

Divine 3 Type: transmogrification

Range: selfDuration: 1 turn per level

This spell endows the caster with a pair of majestic wings on his shoulders. The caster’s alignment, deity and spell signature determine the appearance of the wings (e.g. bat wings, butterfly wings, eagle wings, etc.). The wings permit the caster to fly in any direction with a combat speed of 120’ per round, and an encounter speed of 360’ per turn. The speed is reduced by encumbrance, however, and the caster of *winged**flight*cannot carry aloft more weight than his maximum load. *Winged**flight*requires only as much concentration as walking, so the caster can act normally. If *winged flight* is **dispelled** or the duration expires while the caster is flying, the caster will plummet from the air. The caster must be man-sized or smaller when she casts this spell or it fails to work.

###### Word of Command

Divine 1 Type: enchantment

Range: 15’ Duration: 1 round

This spell empowers the caster to give a living target a one word command. The command given must be a single verb in the imperative case, such as “approach,” “die,” “drop,” “flee,” “halt,” ”submit,” “surrender,” or “sleep.” The target must be able to hear and understand the word spoken.

When the command is uttered, the target must make a Spells saving throw. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect. If the save fails, the target is immediately affected by one or more conditions. On its next initiative, it follows the command given. All of the conditions except prone expires at the start of the target’s subsequent initiative. The prone condition ends when the target uses an action to get up.

* *Approach:* The target immediately becomes **enthralled**. On its initiative, it advances at combat speed towards the caster.
* *Die:* The target immediatelyfalls **prone** and becomes **unconscious**. On its initiative, it takes no action.
* *Drop:* The target immediately starts **faltering**. On its initiative, itdrops any items it is carrying in its hands or on its back.
* *Flee:* The target immediately becomes **frightened**. On its initiative, it flees at its running speed away from the caster.
* *Halt:* The target becomes **mesmerized**. On its initiative, it takes no action.
* *Submit:* The target immediately starts **faltering**. On its initiative, it sheathes any weapon it was carrying and prostates itself before the caster, becoming **prone**.
* *Surrender:* The target immediately starts **faltering**. On its initiative, it drops any weapons it is carrying (but not other objects) and raises its hands above its head.
* Sleep: The target immediately faints, falls **prone** and starts **slumbering**. On its initiative, it takes no action.

This list is exemplary rather than exclusive, and the Judge should be prepared to adjudicate other possible *words of command* based on these guidelines.

###### X-Ray Vision

Arcane 5 Type: detection, esoteric

Range: self Duration: concentration

The spell grants the caster the ability to see through most living and nonliving materials. Using *x-ray vision* requires concentration. In each turn (10 minutes), the caster can closely investigate a 10’ x 10’ x 10’ zone, automatically discovering the contents of chests, the location of secret doors or traps, or other hidden objects in the zone. The caster must be in or adjacent to the zone to use x-ray vision. *X-ray vision* can penetrate flesh, stone, earth, or wood within the zone, but not bone or metal; even a thin layer of lead blocks it.

# Chapter 6: Adventures

### Delves, Expeditions, and Voyages

Whether the adventurers are undertaking a specific quest for a patron, or simply seeking excitement, fame, and wealth, they will not find what they seek in the safety of towns and homesteads. Some adventures will take place in underground complexes such as crypts, tombs, labyrinths, or caverns. These locations, generally called **dungeons**, can vary greatly in their layout, design, and location, but all share one common characteristic — they are filled with a variety of challenges and dangers such as deadly monsters, traps, puzzles, and the potential for valuable treasures. An adventure in a dungeon is called a **delve**.

Other adventures will take place in thinly-settled frontiers or even unsettled lands beyond the borders of civilization. These **wildernesses** will confront the adventurers with natural hazards, wild beasts, savage tribes, and monstrous predators. An adventure in the wilderness is called an **expedition**.

Some adventures will even take the characters to the treacherous waters of the high seas, where they may face lacerating weather, sea monsters, and lost isles. Sea adventurers are called **voyages**. Voyages can involve fleets of vessels, aquatic and flying monsters, artillery, weather, and other complexities, which are discussed separately in Chapter 7.

## Dungeon Delves

The following rules apply to adventuring in dungeons. Additional rules are offered later in this chapter for adventuring in other kinds of environments. Unless otherwise noted, rules that apply to dungeon delves also apply to other types of adventures and rules that apply to adventurers apply to monsters, too. (It’s just easier to present the information from an adventurer’s point of view).

### Turns and Rounds

When delving a dungeon, adventurers take actions in units of time known as **turns** and **rounds**. Gameplay ordinarily proceeds in turns when the adventurers are exploring the dungeon and then shifts into rounds when the adventurers have an encounter.

A turn is a period of time ranging from a few minutes to a quarter hour. A round is a brief interval of time in which flurries of activity are punctuated by pauses and lulls that can be as brief as 10 – 15 seconds and as long as a minute or two depending on the complexity of the engagement. For instance, in a gladiatorial bout between two fighters, a round might be just 10 seconds, but in a huge battle between hundreds of troops, it might be a minute. For purposes of time-keeping, however, there are always 10 rounds per turn and 6 turns per hour of in-game time. (Any extra time is assumed to be taken up by, e.g., bandaging wounds, catching your breath, cleaning your weapons, and other “background” activities.) Each hour of dungeon delving counts as a strenuous ancillary activity (p. XX).

### Speed and Distance

Adventurers undertaking a dungeon delve can move at one of three basic speeds: exploration speed, combat speed, and running speed. (Special types of movement, including climbing, crawling, rappelling, sneaking, swimming, and traversing, are discussed later.) If using a battlemap or VTT, all speed and distance can be precisely measured on the map grid, with tokens to represent adventurers, creatures, and dungeon features. Otherwise the Judge must adjudicate speed and distance in the “theater of the mind.”

**Exploration speed** is measured in feet per turn and represents a pace appropriate to cautious exploration and careful mapping in an area of treacherous ground, shadowy obscurity, and dangerous pitfalls. Exploration speed is very slow (less than 1mph) but offers several advantages. When moving at exploration speed:

* Any party members equipped with a 10’ pole can use their pole(s) to probe ahead.
* Any party members who are in bright light can map the dungeon.
* Any party members who need to concentrate to maintain a spell or effect can do so.
* Any party members who are proficient in Searching can hastily search the areas they move through.
* The party makes much less noise when it moves (see p. XX).

**Combat speed** is measured in feet per round and represents a brief hustle in conditions of danger and distraction. Combat speed is generally used only during encounters or other circumstances where time is tracked in rounds. A party can explore a dungeon at combat speed if desired, but it loses the ability to use 10’ poles, map, or hastily search, and makes much more noise (see p. XX).

**Running speed** is measured in feet per round and represents the fastest pace an adventurer can maintain in the treacherous conditions of dungeons and the wilderness. Adventurers moving at running speed must move forward in a straight line or gentle curve and are **disordered** until the start of their next initiative, suffering a -2 penalty to AC. An adventuring running in difficult terrain (such as running up an accumulation of scree and talus), must make a Paralysis saving throw. Adventurers with Acrobatics can add their class level to the save. If the save succeeds, the adventurer completes his movement. If the save fails, the adventurer falls **prone** at the half-way point of his movement. Adventurers can only run for brief periods of time before needing rest. After running for 10 rounds +/- CON modifier, and each subsequent round that he runs thereafter, the adventurer must make a Paralysis saving throw. If the adventurer has Endurance proficiency, he gains a +4 bonus on the throw. If the save succeeds, the adventurer can continue running next round. If the save fails, the adventurer is immediately **winded.** Winded adventurers cannot run or charge. The condition is ended when the character rests for one turn (10 minutes).

### Marching and Mapping

When the party forays into the dungeon, they must organize themselves into **party formation**, sometimes called a marching order. The best formation for any given dungeon delve will depend on the width of the passages within the dungeon and the class make-up of the party. In corridors that are 5’ wide or less, adventures typically explore in single file. In corridors that are 6’ wide or wider, adventurers typically advance in two columns alongside one another. Heavily armored adventurers, such as fighters, crusaders, spellswords, and vaultguards usually occupy the front ranks, though in areas with numerous traps and pitfalls, a thief might move ahead of them as a scout. The second rank is usually made up of adventurers equipped with spears or polearms. Craftpriest, mages, priestesses, and venturers typically occupy the middle ranks. The rear guard is generally made up of either fast-moving or missile-equipped adventurers such as assassins, bards, bladedancers, explorers, nightblades, or thieves. If there are enough fighters, they can also assume the role of rear guard. It is important to document the formation so it is always clear as the group progresses through their adventure where each person is located.

If a battlemap or virtual table top (VTT) is being utilized, players can use dice, tokens, or miniature figures to represent their characters and their position within the formation. Otherwise, party formation can be recorded on scratch paper.

A dungeon delving party can designate an adventurer as the **mapper**. The mapper usually stands in the middle of the party formation. He must use both hands for mapping, must be within a brightly lit area, and suffers from the **vulnerable** condition (p. XX) due to distraction. The mapper draws a map of the dungeon as the adventurers explore it, ensuring the group does not become lost and keeping track of the areas that have been explored. Typically, dungeons are mapped on graph paper with 1/4” square grids, with a scale of either 5’ or 10’ per square. The player controlling the mapper, more than any other player, must pay close attention to all descriptions of areas offered by the Judge, as an error in the map could lead to difficulties or even harm for the group. Some groups employ multiple mappers to ensure the accuracy of their records.

The mapper should, but does not have to, have the Mapping proficiency (p. XX). If the mapper does have the proficiency, the Judge will provide reasonably accurate measurements. If the mapper makes an error on his map, the Judge will make a secret proficiency throw on behalf of the character to see if he realizes his error. If the mapper doesn’t have the proficiency, then the Judge will provide only vague measurements and the character has no opportunity to passively detect errors.

In the event that the mapper is killed, the player of the deceased character typically passes on cartography duties to a player whose character is still alive. This adventurer, in the game, acquires the map from the deceased mapper and continues their fallen companion’s work.

### Light and Darkness

Dungeon adventures usually take place in lightless catacombs and underground caves, environments where it is essential to bring light sources such as candles, torches, and lanterns. Candles emit bright light in a radius of 5’ and cast dim light another 5’ (out to 10’ total). Lanterns and torches emit light bright enough in a radius of 15’ and cast dim, shadowy light another 15’ (out to 30’ total). Adventurers in dim light cannot discern colors or read books, maps, or scrolls.

Torches shed light for 6 turns before burning out. Lanterns are fueled by flasks of oil; one flask of oil can keep a lantern burning for 24 turns. Adventurers or monsters that carry light sources can have difficulty surprising their opponents, as the light gives them away in advance.

Some adventurers, such as thieves, possess **shadowy senses.** When moving at combat speed or exploration speed, an adventurer with shadowy senses can “see” as if he were carrying a light source that sheds dim light in a 30’ radius. Shadowy senses can be used to fight, search, and so on. However, shadowy senses is actually relying on hearing, scent, touch, and human echolocation so it cannot be used to do activities requiring bright light. Shadowy senses does not function if the adventurer is moving at running speed, suffering from the **deafened** condition, or if in an area of magical darkness or magical silence.

Some adventurers and many monsters can enchant themselves with or natively possess **lightless vision** which allows them to see as if they were carrying a light source that shed dim light within a limited range. Lightless vision does not enable creatures to discern writing or fine details, so even creatures with lightless vision need light sources for some tasks. Assassins, nightblades, thieves, and other characters proficient in Hiding can hide from lightless vision.

Any creatures who cannot see (for whatever reason) are considered **blinded**.Blinded creatures are easy to sneak up on, and suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls. They cannot claim line of sight on any targets and cannot make missile attacks. They can only make melee attacks if they have reason to know the target is there. They suffer a -4 penalty to their melee attack throw and proficiency throws impacted by sight (Judge’s discretion). They reduce their speed to one third their normal rate. See **Conditions** (p. XX).

### Searching and Listening

While exploring the depths of a dungeon, adventurers can search for hidden features such as secret doors, hidden traps, or buried treasure, or listen carefully for the strange sounds that percolate throughout the underdark.

###### Searching

By using the Adventuring proficiency, an adventurer can attempt to methodically search the area within 5’ of his location, or 10’ of his location if equipped with a long pole or similar implement. Attempting to methodically search requires one turn (10 minutes) and a Searching proficiency throw of 18+. The Judge makes the throw in secret on behalf of the adventurer. The Judge might apply bonuses or penalties to the roll depending on the adventurer’s tools, the degree of concealment of the hidden features, and other factors.

If the throw succeeds, the adventurer notices any hidden features within the area he searched. If the throw fails, or there is nothing hidden, the adventurer finds nothing. The adventurer can make repeated attempt to methodically search a location if desired.

Thieves (and certain other character classes found in other ***ACKS***sourcebooks) are especially proficient in searching for hidden features. The target value for a thief’s Searching proficiency throws is determined by his class level and proficiencies choices; it might be as low as 1+. A thief gains a +4 bonus to his Searching proficiency throw when he methodically searches.

When time is short, a thief can attempt to hastily search for hidden features. Attempting to hastily search requires one round and a Searching proficiency throw. The Judge makes the throw in secret on behalf of the thief. If the throw succeeds, the thief notices any hidden features within the area he searched. If it fails, or there is nothing hidden, the thief finds nothing. A thief cannot repeat the attempt to hastily search the same area again until he reaches a higher experience level, but he can attempt to methodically search the area.

A thief can automatically attempt to hastily search while moving at exploration speed or less. Anytime the thief moves within 5’ of a hidden feature (within 10’ if equipped with a pole), the Judge secretly makes a proficiency throw on the thief’s behalf. If the throw succeeds, the thief notices the hidden feature (and if it’s a trap, he notices it before triggering it). If the throw fails, the thief does not notice the feature (and, if it’s a trap, he or another character in the party might trigger it as they move). Note that this counts as a failure to hastily search for hidden features.

The most common hidden features are secret doors and traps, discussed below, but there is no limit to the surprises a Judge might hide in a dungeon. Some features might be partially hidden and offer a bonus to Searching throws, or permit a hasty throw even for non-thieves, and others might be so obscure as to require a methodical search at a severe penalty.

###### Listening

Any adventurer can and will automatically hear loud and unusual noises. No special throw is required to hear a thunderclap or a berserker’s battle cry as he charges you. Other, quieter, sounds can only be heard with attention and luck.

An adventurer standing at a door, passageway, or intersection can actively listen for sounds coming from the other side of the door or passage. An adventurer who is not currently casting, concentrating, running, or fighting can also passively hear sounds that stand out from the ambient noise of their environment. In either case, the adventurer must be the closest creature in the party relative to the location of the sound or suspected sound.

To see if the adventurer hears the sound, the Judge makes a Listening proficiency throw in secret on his behalf. By virtue of their Adventuring proficiency, every adventurer can throw vs. a target value of 18+; but adventurers with certain class powers or proficiencies will have target values of 14+ or lower. If the throw succeeds, the adventurer hears any noises in earshot. If the throw fails, or if there aren’t any noises in earshot, the adventurer doesn’t hear anything. Listening only requires one round but can only be undertaken once per turn (10 minutes) if the party is moving at all, because it takes time for people to settle down into quiet.

The Earshot by Sound and Environment table lists the range at which various sounds can be heard by adventurers. The number before the slash is the distance at which the sound is automatically audible while the number after the slash is the distance at which the sound will only be heard with a successful Listening throw. “NA” means “not audible”. Quiet environments include crypts, tombs, villages or small towns at night, and still, empty wilderness. Normal environments include inhabited dungeons, villages or small towns during the day, large towns or cities at night, and ordinary wilderness. Loud environments include major battlefields, large towns and cities by day, wilderness during windy and rainy conditions, as well as venues such as arenas, cantinas, inns, and taverns. When measuring earshot, treat each closed door or wooden wall between the listener and source as 5’ of distance and each 1’ of stone wall as 10’ of distance.

| Earshot by Sound and Environment | | | |

### Doors and Dungeonbashing

While subterranean caverns and abandoned mines might have unrestricted tunnels and adits, many dungeon corridors are blocked by doors. The standard door in a dungeon is a sturdy construct of heavy wood reinforced with iron banding, though some doorways are sealed with rotten or fragile doors or even just curtains or skins.

Dungeon doors are usually closed, and often locked or stuck. An adventurer with the right key can unlock a locked door in one round. (If in combat, unlocking the door counts as an action in lieu of attacking; see p. XX). Otherwise, the locked door can be opened by picking the lock or battering the door down. Thieves (and certain other character classes found in other ***ACKS***sourcebooks) are capable of picking locks. A thief can attempt to pick a lock either hastily or methodically. He must have access to thieves’ tools to make the attempt.

Attempting to hastily pick a lock requires one full round and a Lockpicking proficiency throw. If the throw succeeds, the lock is opened. If it fails on an unmodified roll of 1-3, the thief breaks his pick in the lock, jamming it. The lock cannot thereafter be picked. If it fails on any other result, the thief cannot figure out how to quickly open the lock. He can still attempt to open it methodically, but cannot make another attempt to hastily pick the same lock again until he reaches a higher experience level.

Attempting to methodically pick a lock requires one turn (10 minutes) and a Lockpicking proficiency throw with a +4 bonus. If the throw succeeds, the lock is opened. If it fails on a natural roll of 1, the thief breaks his pick in the lock, jamming it. The lock cannot thereafter be picked. If it fails on any other result, the thief fails to pick the lock, but can make another methodical attempt if desired.

Certain bonuses or penalties might apply to the throw, depending on the thief’s tools, the complexity of the lock, and other factors.

If subtlety fails, an adventurer can batter down a locked door if equipped with any type of axe. Simple wooden doors take one turn to batter down with an axe, while sturdy iron-banded doors take 3 turns to batter down. Solid metal or stone doors cannot generally be battered down without heavy equipment capable of dealing structural damage. The adjoining table provides the armor class and structural hit points of various doors and portals.

| Lead Glass Window (24” x 46” x.25” and 25lbs or less) |  | 0 | - | Broken open in 1 round with any weapon |

An adventurer, or a pair of adventurers working together, can attempt to bash open a stuck door in one round. If In combat, bashing a door requires a combat action. The adventurer(s) must make a Dungeonbashing proficiency throw of 18+. For each point of Strength adjustment, modify the result of the die roll by ±4. (A character with Strength 18 thus opens doors with a Dungeonbashing proficiency throw of 6+). If a pair of adventurers cooperate to bash open a door, use the stronger character’s Strength adjustment +4. An adventurer equipped with a crowbar gains an additional +2 bonus. Creatures gain a further +8 bonus to Dungeonbashing for each size category above man-sized, and a -8 penalty for each size below it. Doors of unusual material or size might impose further modifiers on this proficiency throw. If the throw succeeds, the door is instantly forced open. If the throw fails, the adventurer(s) bounce(s) off it with a grunt and thud. If the throw fails on an unmodified 1, the adventurer(s) bounce(s) off with a painful grunt, suffering 1 bludgeoning damage. Adventurers can try again if they fail.

| Equipment Required | Key | Thieves’ tools | Thieves’ tools | Axe | Crowbar (optional, +2) |

Some dungeons are so drenched in evil that the doors themselves are antagonistic. Such evil doors automatically swing shut when released unless spiked or wedged open. Evil doors always open easily for monsters, unless the door is spiked shut, held firm, or magically closed. Spiking shut a door requires one round per spike. Spiked doors can be forced open with a Dungeonbashing throw, at a -4 penalty for each additional spike after the first. A door can have a maximum of 4 spikes securing it.

Some doors are somehow concealed or hidden — these are secret doors. Common secret doors are sliding panels in a wall, trap-doors under rugs, and so on. Secret doors can only be discovered by searching (see above). Apart from being hidden, secret doors function like other doors, and might need to be unlocked, battered down, or bashed open.

### Traps and Trapbreaking

Traps are an ever-present danger during dungeon delves. Dungeon traps range from simple pitfalls to deadly devices. Adventurers can find traps by successfully searching for hidden features (discussed above) or by activating the trap (usually unintentionally).

Each traps is activated by a specific trigger, such as opening a door or tripping a tripwire. When an adventurer takes an action that might (but not necessarily will) activate a trap, such as walking down a corridor with a tripwire, the Judge will secretly roll 1d6. On a roll of 1-2, the adventurer has accidentally activated the trap. On a roll of 3-6, the adventurer has accidentally missed the trap entirely and it remains inactivated. Depending on the location of the trigger, the party’s formation, and the vagaries of chance, the Judge might secretly roll many times before a hapless adventurer sets off a trap! Some traps can be accidentally (or intentionally!) activated by probing with a 10’ pole; in that case the pole is treated as an adventurer moving 5’ ahead of its bearer for purposes of activation.

The effect of the trap will vary depending on its type. The most common trap is a pit. Creatures falling into a pit suffer 1d6 bludgeoning damage per 10’ fallen. Some traps might offer their victims a saving throw to reduce or avoid their effects, or might only damage the adventurers on a successful attack throw.

With the aid of his thieves’ tools, a thief can attempt to disable or set off a trap harmlessly. A thief can disarm traps either hastily or methodically. Attempting to hastily disable a trap requires one full round and a Trapbreaking proficiency throw. If the throw succeeds, the trap is disarmed or discharged harmlessly (thief’s choice). If it fails on a natural roll of 1-3, the thief accidentally triggers the trap. If it fails on any other result, the thief cannot figure out how to quickly disable the trap. He can still attempt to disable it methodically, but cannot make another attempt to hastily remove the same trap again until he reaches a higher experience level.

Attempting to methodically disable a trap requires one turn (10 minutes) and a Trapbreaking proficiency throw with a +4 bonus. If the throw succeeds, the trap is disarmed or discharged harmlessly. If it fails on a natural roll of 1, the thief accidentally triggers the trap. If it fails on any other result, the thief is unable to disable the trap. The thief can make repeated attempts to methodically remove the same trap if desired.

Other bonuses or penalties might apply to the proficiency throw, depending on the thief’s tools, the complexity of the trap, and other factors. If desired, a thief can re-arm a disarmed (but not discharged) trap with a successful Trapbreaking throw.

If a thief is unavailable (or unwilling!), another adventurer can use Adventuring proficiency to attempt to methodically disable a trap with a Trapbreaking proficiency throw of 18+.

| Failed Throw | Trap not disarmed, cannot repeat | Trap not disarmed, try again |
| Botched Throw (2-3) | Trap triggered | N/A |
| Botched Throw (1) | Trap triggered | Trap triggered |

### Caving and Spelunking

Sometimes the only way to advance through a dungeon is to climb up or descend down a vertical obstacle such as a cave shaft, cliff or pillar. Other times the adventurers might come upon a chasm or pit over which they have to cross, or an overhang onto which they need to grab and clamber, or a narrow passage through they must squeeze.

Adventurers with access to magic can, of course, bypass such obstacles more easily using spells such as *arcane shift*, *flight*, *leaping*, *levitation*, *shrinking*,and *telekinesis*. Others must resort to climbing, rappelling, jumping, leaping, and crawling.

###### Climbing

By virtue of their Adventuring proficiency, all adventurers can climb ropes, branchy trees, and other easy obstacles. Only adventurers proficient in Climbing or Mountaineering, or whose climbing is supervised by an adventurer proficient in Mountaineering, can tackle sheer surfaces. A party of adventurers therefore has three ways to ascend a sheer surface. Either a proficient climber can ascend first and secure a rope to make an easy climb for his party members; an adventurer with a grappling hook can secure a rope to make it an easy climb; or the party can ascend the surface together simultaneously under the guidance of a proficient mountaineer.

Securing a rope with a grappling hook requires targeting a boulder, parapet, ledge, or other counterweight. The Judge determines the AC of the target counterweight (usually 1 – 3). The attack throw suffers a -2 penalty if the target is 11’ – 30’ away, a -5 penalty if the target is 31 – 50’ away, and a -10 penalty if the target is 51’ to 100’ away. If the throw succeeds, the grapple is securely attached. If the throw fails, the grapple fails to hook. If the throw fails on an unmodified 1, it seems to hook but slips loose the first time anyone fails a Climbing throw to ascend it. The Judge makes the throw in secret on behalf of the party so they don’t know if the hook will stay secure.

An adventurer scaling an easy obstacle must make a Climbing proficiency throw for each 100’ climbed (with a minimum of one check required at the midpoint). The target value is 8+, or based on the class level of the adventurer or the mountaineer assisting him.

* If the throw succeeds, the adventurer can ascend or descend safely for 100’.
* If the throw fails, the adventurer makes no progress for one round.
* If the throw fails on an unmodified 1, the adventurer falls from the midpoint of the distance they were attempting to climb on this proficiency throw, taking 1d6 bludgeoning damage per 10’ fallen.
* An adventurer who is proficient in both Climbing and Mountaineering who is using mountaineering gear never falls while climbing an easy obstacle, even on a botch, provided he moved at one-third combat speed or less.

An adventurer scaling a sheer surface must also make a Climbing proficiency throw for each 100’ climbed (with a minimum of one check required at the midpoint). The target value is based on the class level of the adventurer or of the mountaineer assisting him.

* If the throw succeeds, the adventurer can ascend or descend safely for 100’.
* If the throw fails, the adventurer falls from the midpoint of the distance they were attempting to climb on this proficiency throw, taking 1d6 bludgeoning damage per 10’ fallen.
* An adventurer who is proficient in both Climbing and Mountaineering who is using mountaineering gear does not fall while climbing a sheer surface provided he moved at one-third combat speed or less and did not roll an unmodified 1. A roll of 1 always triggers a fall from a sheer surface!

Whether scaling an easy obstacle or a sheer surface, an adventurer can climb at his exploration speed or, if action is being tracked in rounds, one-third his combat speed. An adventurer with Climbing proficiency can take a -5 penalty to move at one-half combat speed or -10 penalty to move at full combat speed. The Judge can impose other modifiers to the mechanics above to reflect weather conditions, wind, and other circumstances. For example, a very easy slope might grant a +5 bonus to the Climbing throw, enabling characters to move at full combat speed without penalty.

When an adventurer falls, he immediately plummets a distance equal to half the attempted distance, plus the distance covered by any previous throws, taking 1d6 bludgeoning damage per 10 feet. If fighting breaks out during a climb, any adventurers climbing sheer surfaces are **vulnerable** (p. XX).

###### Rappelling

An adventurer proficient in Climbing or Mountaineering, or assisted by an adventurer with Mountaineering proficiency, can rapidly descend a sheer surface by **rappelling**. Rappelling is done by using the body and limbs to slow the descent and is both dangerous and challenging. To set up a rappel, an adventurer must first secure a rope to a boulder, ledge, pillar, or other counterweight near the edge of the descent. This takes one full round for each rope.

Once a rope is secured, an adventurer can rappel down it. Each adventurer rappelling down a rope must make a Climbing proficiency throw for each 100’ descended (with a minimum one check required at the midpoint). The target value is based on the adventurer’s class level.

* If the throw succeeds, the adventurer can rappel down at his running speed.
* If the throw fails, the adventurer clutches the rope too firmly and can only can rappel down at his combat speed.
* If the roll fails on an unmodified 1, the adventurer falls from the midpoint of the distance they were attempting to climb on this proficiency throw, taking 1d6 bludgeoning damage per 10’ fallen.
* An adventurer proficient in both Climbing and Mountaineering never falls while rappelling.

The Judge can impose other modifiers to the mechanics above to reflect weather conditions, wind, and other circumstances. If fighting break out during a climb, any adventurers rappelling are **vulnerable** (p. XX).

###### Crawling Traverse

Adventurers who confront a chasm too wide or dangerous to jump can instead cross by rigging and using a **crawling traverse**. To set up a crawling traverse, an adventurer must first secure a rope to a boulder, ledge, pillar, or other counterweight on the near side of the obstacle. This takes one full round. When the rope is secured, the adventurer must then hurl a grappling hook to secure the rope to a counterweight on the far side. Securing a rope with a grappling hook requires a successful attack throw. The Judge determines the AC of the target counterweight (usually 1 – 3). The attack throw suffers a -2 penalty if the target is 11’ – 30’ away, a -5 penalty if the target is 31 – 50’ away, and a -10 penalty if the target is 51’ to 100’ away. If the throw succeeds, the grapple is securely attached. If the throw fails, the grapple fails to hook. The adventurer can try again until he succeeds. The adventurer must then spend one full round to tighten the traverse.

Once the traverse is rigged, the adventurers can begin to crawl across the traverse. The traverse will be able to support a load of up to 45 stone per rope used. Crawling across the traverse requires both hands and feet, leaving the adventurer **vulnerable** while doing so (p. XX). An adventurer must make a Climbing proficiency throw for each 100’ traversed (with a minimum of one check required at the midpoint). The target value is 8+, or based on the adventurer’s class level if he has Climbing proficiency or if the traverse was rigged by a character with Mountaineering proficiency.

* If the throw succeeds, the adventurer can traverse at his exploration speed or, if action is being tracked in rounds, at one-third his combat speed.
* If the throw fails, the adventurer makes no progress for one round.
* If the throw fails on an unmodified 1, the adventurer falls off the traverse, taking 1d6 bludgeoning damage per 10’ fallen.
* An adventurer proficient in both Climbing and Mountaineering never falls while traversing, provided he moved at one-third combat speed or less.

An adventurer proficient in Climbing can traverse at one-half combat speed by taking a -5 penalty to the proficiency throw and at full combat speed by taking a -10 penalty to the throw.

###### Balancing Traverse

Sometimes an adventurer may have to move across a narrow bridge over some vast subterranean crevice, or inch along the narrow ledge between a wall and a pit, or even tightrope walk across a rope. When an adventurer attempts to move along a precarious (1/2” to 4”) or narrow (4” to 8”) path, he is attempting a **balancing traverse**. Paths that are narrower than 1/2” cannot be traversed.

By virtue of their Adventuring proficiency, all adventurers can attempt balancing traverses of narrow paths. Only adventurers proficient in Climbing can attempt balancing traverses of precarious paths.

An adventurer traversing a narrow path must make a Climbing proficiency throw for each 100’ crossed (with a minimum of one check required at the midpoint). The target value is 8+, or based on the class level of the adventurer or mountaineer assisting him.

* If the throw succeeds, the adventurer can move safely for 100’.
* If the throw fails, the adventurer makes no progress for one round.
* If the throw fails on an unmodified 1, the adventurer loses his balance and falls off the path, taking 1d6 bludgeoning damage per 10’ fallen.
* An adventurer who is proficient in both Climbing and Cat Burglary never falls while traversing a narrow surface, even on an unmodified 1, provided he moved at one-third combat speed or less.

An adventurer traversing a precarious path must also make a Climbing proficiency throw for each 100’ crossed (with a minimum of one check required at the midpoint). The target value is based on the class level of the adventurer.

* If the throw succeeds, the adventurer can move safely for 100’.
* If the throw fails, the adventurer loses his balance and falls off the path, taking 1d6 bludgeoning damage per 10’ fallen.
* An adventurer who is proficient in both Climbing and Cat Burglary does not fall while traversing a precarious surface provided he moved at one-third combat speed or less and did not roll an unmodified 1. A roll of 1 always triggers a fall from a precarious ledge.

Whether traversing a narrow or precarious path, an adventurer can move at his exploration speed or, if action is being tracked in rounds, one-third his combat speed. An adventurer with Climbing proficiency can take a -2 penalty to move at one-half combat speed or -5 penalty to move at full combat speed. The Judge can impose other modifiers to the mechanics above to reflect wet surfaces, wind, and other circumstances.

If fighting breaks out during a balancing traverse, any adventurers on narrow or precarious path are **vulnerable** (p. XX). An adventurer who suffers damage while on a narrow or precarious path must make a Paralysis saving throw. Adventurers proficient in Cat Burglary gain a +2 bonus to the save. If the save succeeds, the character successfully maintains his balance. If the save fails, the adventurer loses his balance and falls off the path.

###### Belaying

An adventurer who has already ascended or traversed part or all of an obstacle can provide security to subsequent climbers by belaying rope to them in readiness to break a fall. Belaying requires a rope (or additional rope, if the adventurer is climbing a rope) of sufficient length to cover the distance between the belayer and the climber.

If the climber falls, the belayer must make a Dungeonbashing proficiency throw of 18+, modified by STR bonus as usual (±4 per point). The belayer suffers a penalty equal to the climber’s encumbrance in stone unless proficient in both Climbing and Mountaineering.

* If the proficiency throw succeeds, the belayer smoothly decelerates the climber’s fall, preventing damage.
* If the proficiency throw fails, the belayer is unable to slow the fall, and the climber falls the length of the rope, taking 1d6 bludgeoning damage per 10’ fallen.
* If the proficiency throw fails on an unmodified 1, or by 14 or more, the belayer not only fails to slow the fall, but risks falling himself. The belayer must make an immediate Climbing proficiency throw, applying the falling climber’s encumbrance as a penalty. If this throw fails, the belayer falls.

If the belayer was himself secured by another belayer further along than himself, that belayer must now repeat the steps above. It is possible, through a succession of poor rolls, for an entire party to fall.

###### Jumping and Leaping

The maximum height in feet that an adventurer can leap vertically is equal to his DEX bonus + 1, to a minimum of 1’. The maximum distance in feet that an adventurer can jump horizontally is equal to his DEX score + 1d6. The height and distance jumped are reduced by 1’ per stone of encumbrance the adventurer is carrying. An adventurer must have a moving start of at least 20’ or his leaping height and jumping distance, after encumbrance, are halved. If a jump occurs in combat or other circumstances where action is being tracked in rounds, the distance jumped counts against the adventurer’s movement during the round.

An adventurer proficient in Acrobatics can add his class level to his DEX score, to a maximum of 24, for purposes of calculating his leaping height and jumping distance. A DEX score of 19-20 grants a +4 bonus, 21-23 grants a +5 bonus, and 24 grants a +6 bonus.

|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Proficiency |  | Effect on DEX | Vertical Leap | Horizontal Jump |
| Adventuring |  | None | DEX Bonus + 1 | DEX + 1d6 – encumbrance |
| Acrobatics |  | Increase by class level, max 24 | DEX Bonus + 1 | DEX + 1d6 – encumbrance |

Sometimes an adventurer’s mount, dog, or other animal companion might make a jump, or the adventurer might be pursued across a chasm by another monster. The height and distance that a creature can jump is multiplied by its running speed / 120. Creatures are assumed to have DEX scores of 10 if not otherwise noted. For instance, a medium horse with a running speed of 180’ could jump (10 + 1d6 ) x 1.5 feet.

Jumps onto inclined surfaces, loose scree, narrow pillars, or other precarious destinations can fail disastrously, as can jumps made when charging into melee. The adventurer must make a Paralysis saving throw when he lands. Adventurers proficient in Acrobatics gain a +2 bonus to the save. If the save succeeds, the character successfully lands the jump. If the save fails, the adventurer lands short by 1d6 feet. If this puts him on solid ground, he falls prone. If this puts him exactly at the edge of a chasm, cliff, etc., then he ends his round hanging by his fingers and must climb or be pulled up. If this lands him over empty space, he falls, suffering 1d6 bludgeoning damage per 10’ when he hits the ground.

**Historical Note:** The greatest long jumper of the ancient world was Chionis of Laconia, a Spartan athlete who jumped 23’2” at the 656 BC Olympics. The current world record, made by modern athletes with all of the advantages of sports science, stands at 29’4”. We have assumed that an adventurer with a Dexterity score of 18 can attempt to match Chionis’s record, while adventurers with Acrobatics can attempt jumps to lengths similar to contemporary Olympians.

###### Squeezing

Abandoned mines, natural caverns, and constricted catacombs often present adventurers with boulder-filled **chokepoints** and narrow **squeezes**. A chokepoint is a feature that narrows for less than 5’ of length. A squeeze can be of any length.

An adventurer who wants to pass through a chokepoint or squeeze must make a Squeezing throw at the start of his initiative each round. The target value for the Squeezing throw is equal to the adventurer’s encumbrance in stone. A character with Contortionism proficiency gains a +4 bonus to the throw. If the throw fails, the adventurer makes no progress for one round. If the throw fails on an unmodified 1, the adventurer becomes **stuck**.

A stuck adventurer cannot attack, cast spells, move, or take any other action except to attempt to escape. He is also **vulnerable**. When attempting to escape from being stuck, an adventurer has two options, wiggling backwards or pushing forward. If the adventurer attempts to wiggle backwards, he must make a Paralysis saving throw. If the throw succeeds, the adventurer retreats 10’ and the condition ends. If the throw fails, the adventurer remains stuck.

If the adventurer attempts to push forward, he must make a Dungeonbashing proficiency throw. If the throw succeeds, the adventurer advances 10’ and the condition ends. If the throw fails, the adventurer worsens his plight. Further attempts to escape have a cumulative -4 penalty to their throws.

The adventurer’s encumbrance in stone is applied as a penalty to both the saving throw and proficiency throw to get free. However, if the adventurer has Contortionism proficiency, he gains a +4 bonus on either throw.

### Swimming and Drowning

Adventurers on a dungeon delve frequently encounter water obstacles that halt their progress. Whether they need to plumb a cave pool, swim through a sunken corridor, or dive into the sunless sea, the rules are the same.

An adventurer without a swimming speed must make a Swimming throw at the start of his initiative each round he is in water too deep for him to stand. The target value for the Swimming throw is equal to the adventurer’s encumbrance in stone. If the water is cold, rough, or fast-moving, the Judge might impose a penalty on the swimming throw of -2, -4, or more. If the character has the Swimming proficiency, he gains a +4 bonus on the throw. If this bonus would improve his Swimming throw to 0+ or better, he need not make a Swimming throw at all.

If the throw succeeds, the adventurer stays afloat. Swimming movement can be based on either the combatant’s combat or running speed, in either case being one-quarter the normal rate. A swimming combatant using combat movement may attack after his movement. A swimming combatant using running movement cannot attack, and is subject to becoming **winded** as per the running rules.

If the throw fails, the adventurer is **drowning**. A spellcaster that begins drowning loses any spell he was attempting to cast that round. A drowning adventurer is **vulnerable**, cannot take any actions, and no longer makes swimming throws. The adventurer sinks 10’ per round per stone of encumbrance at the start of his initiative. The condition ends if an allied creature who is not drowning grabs it (requiring an action in lieu of moving) and carries it to the surface of the water. The drowning adventurer imposes one-half his weight in encumbrance (usually 7 3/6 stone plus half of any equipment encumbrance). A human or demi-human adventurer can hold his breath for 5 + CON modifier rounds. If the drowning condition has not ended before then, the drowning adventurer dies at the end of his initiative.

### Rest and Recuperation

Delving into dungeons is physically demanding. All adventurers must rest for 1 turn for every 5 turns of exploration and combat. If the adventurers proceed for more than 5 turns without stopping to rest, they become **winded**.Winded adventurers cannot charge or run until they rest for 1 turn. Adventurers with the Endurance proficiency (p. XX) do not need to rest and can stand watch, search for hidden features, or undertake other actions while their party members rest.

## Wilderness Expeditions

When embarking on a wilderness expedition, adventurers must consider a variety of factors such as their destination, necessary equipment, and travel conditions. This includes assessing the need for warm clothing, the necessity of mounts, pack animals, and vehicles; and the logistics of food and drink.

**Note:** Some Judges prefer to “handwave” the logistical considerations of wilderness travel in favor of focusing on high adventure. Other Judges run campaigns where the wilderness is as dangerous as its inhabitants. Be sure to check with your Judge before spending too much attention worrying about rations, weather, and so on.

### Hours and Days

When journeying through the wilderness, time is usually measured in **days** and **hours** until a smaller interval becomes necessary to resolve a particular challenge or encounter. Then the unit of time reverts to turns and hours, as it was in dungeon delves. While the Auran Empire (and most other premodern civilizations) uses measures of hours that change with season, there are always exactly 6 turns in every hour for all game purposes.

### Speed and Distance

Dungeons are dark and cramp warzones where death lurks around every corner. In comparison, wildernesses are wide-open expanses with natural light and safe footing. Adventurers making wilderness expeditions can travel faster and further than those delving dungeons.

###### Expedition Speed

Adventurers on expeditions in the wilderness have a new type of speed, **expedition speed**, which measures the distance they can travel for each day spent traveling as the party’s dedicated activity. Expedition speed is based on exploration speed as shown on the Expedition Speed table below.

The table assumes the party is dedicating the day to travel, i.e. it is undertaking eight hours of intense marching, with the remaining 4 hours of daylight allocated to ancillary activities. If a party wants to travel faster than its expedition speed, it can engage in a **forced march**. Engaging in a forced march applies a movement modifier of x3/2, i.e. it increases speed by 50%. Force marching assumes 12 hours of marching. Characters who are force marching are considered to have used all their ancillary activities on the travel, and cannot undertake any ancillary activities. If a party wants to travel less than its expedition speed, it can travel for an hour as an ancillary activity. (A party that allocates all four of its ancillary activities to travel can travel at half speed.) Traveling for more than four hours counts as a dedicated activity even if party travels fewer miles than its full expedition speed.

The table also assumes relatively open terrain such as gently rolling grassy hills, flat steppe, and sparse shrubland or savannah. Roads can permit even faster movement, while jungles, swamps, and mountains reduce speed considerably, as shown on the table at the bottom of this page. Road multipliers are applied after the base modifier for the terrain through which it passes. Note that wheeled vehicles handled by adventurers with Driving proficiency have a speed multiplier of x2 when on roads, rather than x3/2.

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Exploration Speed  (Feet per Turn) | Expedition Speed  (Miles per Day) | Expedition Speed  (Hexes per Day) | Expedition Speed  (Miles per Hour) |
| 30’ | 6 | 1 | 0.75 |
| 60’ | 12 | 2 | 1.5 |
| 90’ | 18 | 3 | 2.25 |
| 120’ | 24 | 4 | 3 |
| 150’ | 30 | 5 | 3.75 |
| 180’ | 36 | 6 | 4.5 |
| 210’ | 42 | 7 | 5.25 |
| 240’ | 48 | 8 | 6 |
| 270’ | 54 | 9 | 6.75 |
| 300’ | 60 | 10 | 7.5 |
| 330’ | 66 | 11 | 8.25 |
| 360’ | 72 | 12 | 9 |

###### Combat and Running Speed

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Terrain** | **Speed Multiplier** |
| Grassland, scrubland | x1 |
| Barrens, desert, hills, forest | x2/3 |
| Jungle, mountain, swamp | x1/2 |
| Road | x3/2 (x2 for drivers) |
| Mud/Snow | x1/2 |

Dungeons have cramped spaces and uneven terrain that slows movement, but wilderness is much more open. Therefore, combat speed and running speed are three times faster in the wilderness than in the dungeon (i.e. effectively measured in yards rather than feet). This is further modified by the Speed multiplier for the terrain, as shown on the adjoining table. For instance, an adventurer with a combat speed of 40’ has a combat speed of 120’ in the wilderness, but this is reduced to 60’ in swamp. Note that terrain also has implications for wilderness encounter distance (p. XX).

###### Flight Speed

Flying creatures can travel much faster over long distances than creatures traveling by land. If a creature can fly all day, its expedition speed is doubled. For instance, a creature with an exploration speed of 120’ normally has an expedition speed of 24 miles per day. If that same creature were able to fly all day, it would have an air speed of 48 miles per day. If a creature can fly but not all day (for instance, if it is the recipient of a flight spell that grants one hour of flight time), only the portion of the creature’s movement spent in the air is doubled. Air movement is affected normally by all weather conditions except windy conditions. Windy conditions also halve flight speed for all purposes.

Some flying creatures are large enough to serve as mounts. The ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual*** details these creatures, along with the normal load they can carry. Flying creatures can move at full speed when carrying their normal load or less, and at half speed when carrying up to their maximum load. Depending on the creature, it might even be able to carry multiple riders or carry a gondola filled with characters and equipment.

### Marching and Mapping

Exploring and mapping in wilderness expeditions are conducted in a similar manner to that used for dungeon delves. The adventurers first establish a marching formation for their expedition and then proceed through the wilderness, whether it be a dense forest, wild moor, mountain range.

While the wilderness is not as confining as a 5’ wide dungeon corridor, marching formations must still remain relatively narrow in order to traverse the roads, passes, tracks, and trails that cut through the outdoors. A wilderness formation can be up to 15’ wide (sufficient for five man-sized creatures, three horses, or one wagon and one horse side by side) without penalty. Wider formations cannot use roads or trails. In any terrain except grasslands, wider formations also suffer a ½ speed multiplier, -1 penalty to surprise, and -4 penalty to evade.

Movement and mapping are also carried out in a similar way to other types of adventures. The characters journey in a pre-determined order, but the setting is in a wilderness environment such as a forest or glen, rather than underground. The mapper should keep track of the group’s progress if the area is uncharted, or the group may already have a map of the area. The game master will have a map prepared in advance, to have an understanding of the terrain.

The party member assigned as the mapper records their progress if the area is uncharted. Unlike dungeon maps, wilderness maps are typically drafted on graph paper with a hexagonal grid. In regional maps, each hex has a width of 6 miles from side to side, and encompasses about 30 square miles on territory. On large-scale maps, each hex has a width of 24 miles from side, and encompasses about 500 square miles of territory or 16 6-mile hexes. Some Judges ask adventurers in the wilderness to give abstract directions by hex facing, while other Judges prefer that the adventurers narrate a route in natural language based on his descriptions. Be sure to check with your Judge to find out which method he prefers, e.g. “we advance northwest from hex 401 to hex 502” or “we head north by northwest along the bank of the Blood River.”

### Visibility in the Wild

Adventurers can only map the terrain they can see. However, the visibility conditions facing adventurers on a wilderness expedition can range widely. Standing on a mountain in the bright light of noontide, adventurers might be able to see for a dozen miles. In a heavy fog on a moonless night, they might barely make out a few feet in front of them. The Maximum Visibility Distance table shows the maximum visibility distance that adventurers can perceive features of their environment such as terrain, fire, or approaching creatures under varying light conditions, in the absence of some obstacle that blocks line of sight.

|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Feature  Perceived | Daylight | Full  Moonlight | Half  Moonlight | Starlight |
| Terrain\* | 3 miles | 1.5 miles | 4,000’ | 2,000’ |
| Fire\* | 3 miles | 3 miles | 3 miles | 3 miles |
| Humanoid (1 - 9) | 600’ | 300’ | 150’ | 75’ |
| Party/Gang (10 - 30) | 900’ | 450’ | 225’ | 110’ |
| Platoon (31 - 60) | 1,200’ | 600’ | 300’ | 150’ |
| Company (61 - 240) | 1,800’ | 900’ | 450’ | 225’ |
| Battalion (241+) | 3,600’ | 1,800’ | 900’ | 450’ |
| \*Distance can be increased by elevation | | | | |

**Creature Size:** The maximum visibility distance shown is for man-sized creatures. Maximum visibility distance is increased by each mounted man or large creature as 2 men, each huge creature as 6 men, each gigantic creature as 24 men, and each colossal creature as 120 men.

**Elevation:** Maximum visibility distance of terrainand fire is increased by elevation. For each full 4,000’ of elevation, double maximum visibility distance. E.g. maximum visibility distance to a bonfire on a 14,000’ mountain is x2x2x2 = 24 miles or 4 6-mile hexes. Creatures do not necessarily become easier to spot with elevation.

**Terrain:** Dense terrain reduces visibility distance. Barren, desert, forest, forested hills, and scrubby swamp reduce visibility by 33%. Forested mountain, forested swamp, and jungle reduce visibility by 50%.

|  |
| --- |
|  |

**Weather:** In Rainy conditions, maximum visibility distance is halved. In Foggy or Snowy conditions, or Windy conditions in barrens or desert, maximum visibility distance is reduced to a flat 20’. See Weathering the Wild (p. XX) for more details on weather conditions.

### Searching the Wild

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Expedition Movement** | **Target Value** |
| 11 miles or less | 18+ |
| 12 - 23 miles | 17+ |
| 24 - 35 miles | 16+ |
| 36 - 47 miles | 15+ |
| 48 - 59 miles | 14+ |
| 60 - 71 miles | 13+ |
| 72 - 83 miles | 12+ |
| 84 - 95 miles | 11+ |
| 96 - 107 miles | 10+ |
| 108 – 119 miles | 9+ |
| 120 - 131 miles | 8+ |
| 132 - 143 miles | 7+ |
| 144 - 155 miles | 6+ |
| 156 - 167 miles | 5+ |
| 168 - 179 miles | 4+ |
| 180 – 191 miles | 3+ |
| 192 miles or more | 2+ |

When a party of adventurers undertakes a wilderness expedition, they usually do so with a goal in mind. Often that goal is to find dungeons, lairs, and other points of interest in the wild. Finding a point of interest in the wilderness is akin to searching for traps in a dungeon – even if there is one, there’s no guarantee the adventurers will find it when they search. There might be a lair isolated in a remote glade, a temple situated on an inaccessible peak, a cave hidden underground with its only entrance concealed. (The ***ACKS II Judges Journal***provides guidelines on placing points of interest.) Adventuring parties that can cover a lot of ground have a better chance of finding points of interest in the wilderness than parties slowed by encumbrance or bad going. Trackers capable of finding and following spoor are also invaluable.

If the Judge has mapped out the 6-mile hex in detail, he can use the small scale map to adjudicate the search process. Otherwise, the following abstract system can be used: Each hour (six turns) that the adventurers spend searching a hex (i.e. each ancillary activity), the Judge makes a Wilderness Searching throw on their behalf. The target value for the throw is determined by the party’s expedition speed, as shown on the accompanying Wilderness Search table. If the throw succeeds, the party discovers a dungeon entrance, lair, ruin, or other point of interest, if at least one is present. (If more than one lair is present, the Judge will decide which one the adventurers find.) If the throw fails, the party learns nothing.

Marcus, Quintus, and Balbus have journeyed to the Madoan Hills, south of the Borderlands. They decide to begin searching the area. After one hour, the Judge secretly rolls to see if they have discovered a point of interest in their current hex. The party are all mounted on light horses (48 miles per day base expedition movement) and moving through hills (movement multiplier of 2/3), so the party’s movement is 30 miles per day. The target value for their throw is therefore 16+. Unfortunately, the Judge rolls a 12, so their first hour of searching is fruitless.

If any member of the party has the Tracking proficiency, the party should receive a +4 bonus on the proficiency throw.

Had either Marcus, Quintus, or Balbus had Tracking proficiency, the party would have gained a +4 bonus on their throw. With a +4 bonus and a target value of 16+, they would have found a point of interest on a roll of 12 or more.

###### Searching for Specific Points of Interest

Sometimes, an expedition might set out to find a particular point of interest. Searching for a particular point of interest imposes a -4 penalty on the throw. If the throw succeeds, the party discovers the particular point of interest they are looking for, if it is present in the hex. If the throw fails, the party learns nothing.

###### Aerial Reconnaissance

If the party is capable of air travel, their expedition speed is doubled (see p. XX). In addition, when searching clear, grass, scrub, hills, barren, desert, or mountain terrain, they receive one searching throw per three turns (thirty minutes) on the Wilderness Search table, rather than one per hour. However, when searching forest, jungle, or swamp terrain, they suffer -8 penalty to their throw due to the canopy of foliage.

Imagine if the adventurers were mounted on giant eagles with exploration flight speeds of 480’, which translates to 96 miles per day. Since aerial movement is doubled, the giant eagles can fly 192 miles per day with no terrain penalty. At the party’s new expedition speed, the target value for their searching throw is 2+. In addition, since they are searching hills terrain, the Judge will throw on their behalf every three turns instead of every six turns. After thirty minutes of game time, the Judge throws 1d20; the result is a 13, and the party has found something! Had they been searching a forest hex, they’d have only gotten one throw per hour and would have needed 10+; that’s still better than on foot but not nearly as good as aerial reconnaissance on open ground.

###### Wandering Monsters

Adventurers searching a hex are far more likely to encounter monsters than those who are just passing through as quickly as possible. They trigger one random encounter roll per hour while searching, which the Judge will resolve based on the random encounter tables he has prepared for the region. It is possible for adventurers to fail on a search for a point of interest, only to stumble into it by way of a random encounter.

###### Splitting Up

If the party splits up into smaller sub-parties, they can search a hex much more rapidly. Each sub-party can make a separate Searching throw. However, each sub-party is subject to random encounters separately and must deal with the encounter on its own. If the sub-parties are close enough to assist in the encounter, they haven’t really “split up” and are effectively just searching the same area.

###### Land Surveying

If the party has a member with the Land Surveying proficiency, that adventurer can attempt to assess the total number of points of interest in the hex based on the lay of the land, evidence of cultivation, and other factors. The adventurer may attempt an assessment upon first arriving in the hex, and make another attempt each time the hex is searched. For each attempt, the Judge should secretly make a Land Surveying proficiency throw on the adventurer’s behalf. The target value for the proficiency throw is 18+, but the adventurer receives a cumulative +4 bonus for each successful search the party has conducted in the hex up to that point. If the proficiency throw succeeds, the character correctly assesses the number of points of interest in the hex, and the Judge should reveal the number. If the proficiency throw fails with an unmodified 1, the character incorrectly assess the number of interesting points in the hex, and the Judge should roll or choose a false value to reveal. On any other result, the character does not yet have enough information to make or revise an assessment.

Note that, in the absence of magical divination*,* a party can never be certain they have found all of a hex’s points of interest. It is possible a point of interest might remain hidden for weeks, years, or even generations before suddenly being found. The Judge should use his discretion in deciding whether an undiscovered dungeon or lair prevents a hex from being considered secured for purposes of settlement (see p. XX). An undiscovered dire wolf or manticore lair will almost certainly disrupt settlement, while an undiscovered lammasu lair might be a delightful surprise and an undiscovered khepri lair may be harmless until a foolish peasant awakens them in a few seasons…

### Navigating the Wild

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Terrain | Navigation |
| Barrens (any) | 6+ |
| Desert (any) | 6+ |
| Forest (any) | 8+ |
| Grassland (any) | 6+ |
| Hills (any) | 8+ |
| Jungle (any) | 14+ |
| Mountains (any) | 6+ |
| Scrubland (low, sparse) | 6+ |
| Scrubland (high, dense) | 8+ |
| Swamp (marshy, scrubby) | 10+ |
| Swamp (forested) | 14+ |

Adventurers who follow navigable rivers, roads, or other well-established routes are usually safe from the danger of becoming lost. However, most adventuring expeditions eventually head into untamed and unmapped wilderness, where it is easy to become disoriented. To determine if the party loses its way, the Judge must make a Navigation proficiency throw on their behalf at the beginning of each day of travel, using the target values listed in the table below. If any member of the party has the Pathfinding class power or the Navigation proficiency, the party receives a +4 bonus on this proficiency throw, or a +8 bonus if the party collectively knows both Pathfinding and Navigation. As with all throws, if the Judge rolls an unmodified roll of 1, the Navigation throw automatically fails.

If the throw succeeds, the party does not become lost. If the throw fails, the party becomes lost. A lost party does not realize it has become lost that day unless forewarned by, e.g. not getting to a destination it knew was nearby. Otherwise, the party simply strays off in an unintended direction without realizing it. For instance, a party seeking to travel southeast might travel south, or east, or even north or west instead. The Judge determines in which direction the party has strayed on the hex map, either based on the landmarks and terrain or randomly. To randomly determine the direction, the Judge assigns each hex face a value from 1 to 6, and then rolls 1d6 to determine which hex face the adventurers head towards.

The next day, when the Judge makes another Navigation proficiency throw on behalf of the party, they might discover they’ve gotten lost. If the throw succeeds, the party realizes it is lost and can resume traveling in its desired direction. The party does not, however, learn the actual direction it erroneously traveled unless it doubles back the way it came and sets off again. If the throw fails, the party remains ignorant of its misdirection and blithely continues on. (The players might figure out they are lost before the characters do.)

### Surviving the Wild

Each day, adventurers (and other humanoid creatures) must consume a daily ration of food and drink weighing a total of one stone. A typical ration consists of 2 lbs of food (1/ 6 st) and 1 gallon (5/6 st) of water. Adventurers who do not meet their daily ration begin to suffer severe penalties, and might die.

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Animal | Normal Load | Daily Food | Daily Water |
| Camel | 30 st | 3 st | 6 st\* |
| Dog, hunting | 2 st | 0.2 st | 0.4 st |
| Dog, war | 6 st | 0.6 st | 1.2 st |
| Donkey | 15 st | 1.5 st\* | 3 st |
| Elephant | 180 st | 18 st | 36 st |
| Horse, Heavy | 40 st | 4 st | 8 st |
| Horse, Light | 20 st | 2 st | 4 st |
| Horse, Medium | 30 st | 3 st | 6 st |
| Horse, Steppe | 20 st | 2 st\* | 4 st |
| Mule | 25 st | 2.5 st | 5 st |
| Ox | 45 st | 4.5 st\* | 9 st |

Camels, donkeys, horses, and other animals that accompany an expedition also need to consume food and water. Most animals need stones of food equal to their normal load / 10. Most animals needs stones of water equal to their normal load / 5. The adjoining table lists the food and water requirements of the domestic animals in this book. Animal feed for working animals (e.g. those engaged in strenuous activity) costs 2sp per stone.

**Desert Dromedaries:** Camels never become dehydrated unless they go without water for more than six months. When they find a water source, camels drink enough to make up for whatever they missed.

**Efficient Grazers:** Donkeys and steppe horses can usually graze enough food to feed themselves provided they are not force marched. Donkeys and steppe horses are often used as pack animals for this reason.

**Large Expeditions**: For very large expeditions with a variety of different pack and riding animals, some of which are being ridden or worked each day and others not, it is burdensome to track rations for every animal. Instead, simply ignore any donkeys and mules and charge 2.5 st of food and 5 st of water for each other pack or riding animals. This abstracted value is used in calculating supply costs in Chapter 10, **Maneuvers**.

###### Starvation

After one day with less than full rations, adventurers become **hungry.** A hungry adventurer suffersa -1 penalty on attack throws, proficiency throws, and saving throws until he eats a full day’s ration. After two consecutive days without any food, or five consecutive days with an average of half rations, adventurers also becomes **underfed**. An **underfed** adventurer cannot force march or heal wounds naturally (though magic will still work). Eating enough food for a day (over the course of the day, not all at once) ends the hungry and/or underfed condition. After five days of being underfed with no food, or ten days being underfed with an average of half rations, an adventurer becomes **starving**. A starving adventurer cannot force march or heal wounds naturally and loses 1 CON each day thereafter until the condition ends or his CON reaches 0, at which point he dies. Eating enough food for a day replaces the starving condition with the underfed condition. Lost CON returns at a rate of 1 point each day that the character gets a full ration of food.

###### Dehydration

Inadequate water affects characters more swiftly; after a single day without any water, or two days with less than half the required water ration, or five consecutive days with less than a full ration, adventurers become **dehydrated.** A dehydrated character cannot force march or heal wounds naturally and loses 1d6 CON each day thereafter until the condition ends or his CON reaches 0, at which point he dies. Drinking enough water for a day ends the dehydrated condition. Lost CON returns at a rate of 3 points each day that the character gets a full ration of water.

###### Hunting and Foraging

Adventurers can gather firewood and water by foraging, and can gather food by both foraging and hunting.

Foraging for firewood is an ancillary activity that can be undertaken as often as desired. Each adventurer can attempt a Foraging proficiency throw. The target value is 3+ in forest terrain and 14+ in other terrain. If the throw succeeds, that adventurer gathers 10 st of firewood (enough to maintain a campfire for 4 hours). An adventurer with Survival proficiency gains a +4 bonus to forage for firewood.

Foraging for water is an ancillary activity that can be undertaken once per day. Adventurers can automatically gather as much water as they can carry in any hex they cross containing a river or lake. Otherwise the party as a whole (up to 30 man-sized creatures) can attempt a single Foraging proficiency throw to find water. The target value is 14+ in clear, forest, hills, jungle, mountains, or swamp terrain, or 18+ in barrens or desert. If the throw succeeds, the party finds enough water to meet three day’s rations for each character foraging. If the throw fails, the party does not find a source of drinkable water. If any of the adventurers in the party has the Survival proficiency, the party gains a +4 bonus on its Foraging proficiency throw. Parties larger than 30 man-sized creatures should make multiple rolls, with success finding water enough for that group only.

Foraging for food is also an ancillary activity that can be undertaken once per day. For each day of travel while foraging, each adventurer can attempt a Foraging proficiency throw of 18+. If the throw succeeds, that adventurer gathers 1/2 stone of food, enough for three man-sized creatures. If the throw fails, the adventurer doesn’t find anything edible. An adventurer with the Survival proficiency automatically forages enough to feed himself and gains a +4 bonus on his Foraging proficiency throw to gather another 1/2 stone of food. Adventurers suffer a -4 penalty to forage in barrens or desert terrain. Adventurers who do not wish to steal forage from farmers suffer a -4 penalty to their Foraging proficiency throws in civilized territory and a -2 penalty in borderlands territory, as much of the available “forage” is actually crops.

Hunting for food is a dedicated activity. For each day dedicated to hunting, each adventurer can attempt a Hunting proficiency throw of 14+. If the throw succeeds, the character brings in 1 stone of game, i.e. enough to feed 6 man-sized creatures. Adventurers who hunt risk encountering wandering monsters, however, with the Judge rolling on his encounter table based on the terrain. An adventurer with the Survival proficiency gains a +4 bonus on his own Hunting proficiency throw.

For each day dedicated to hunting, a hunting dog can attempt a Hunting Proficiency throw of 19+. The dog gets a +1 bonus to the throw per dog that hunts with it (each of which gets to throw)., to a maximum bonus of +5. Thus a pack of six hunting dogs will get six rolls at 14+ to bring down game.

Game is scarce near human and demi-human settlements and more plentiful in remote wilderness. Adventurers suffer a -4 penalty to their Hunting proficiency throws in civilized territory, but gain a +2 bonus in outlands territory, and +4 in unsettled territory.

Other animals can gather food by grazing. For most animals, grazing a full day’s ration requires one day of dedicated activity. The animal can use its four ancillary activities to travel at half-speed if desired. Donkeys and steppe horses can graze for their full day’s rations with their ancillary activities, enabling them to dedicate their day to travel. Animals in barrens or deserts can only graze if they are native to the terrain.

###### Survival, Simplified

The mathematics for rations and foraging works out as follows. Each adventurer can forage about one-half the food he needs. Each party can find water about every other day. If the party is mounted and moving at half its expedition speed, or if exclusively using donkeys or steppe horses at full speed, the animals can also forage enough food for their own needs. Therefore, if the party carries enough food for each adventurer to last one-half its expected travel time and carries enough water for each adventurer and animal to last for three days, the party can feel safe from starvation and dehydration 90% of the time. If the party is traveling in terrain with abundant rivers and lakes, it can ignore the need to carry water entirely and just carry food.

EXAMPLE: A party on foot with a train of donkeys sets out on a 150-miles expedition. They are uncertain if there are any major lakes or rivers along the way, so they stock up. At 12 miles per day, their journey will take about 12 days. Each adventurer needs to carry 6 days of food (1/6 x 6 = 1 stone) and 3 days of water (5/6 x 6 = 5 stone), or 6 stone total. Each donkey needs to carry 9 stone of water. After setting aside the encumbrance of its own three-day water supply, each donkey can still carry (15 – 3 x 3) = 6 stone total. Thus, if each adventurer is accompanied by one donkey, they can travel for 12 days or about 150 miles in any direction.

The mathematics change if the party is in a barrens or desert, however. Each adventurer can only forage about one-quarter the feed he needs. Each party can only find water every three days. To be 90% secure from dehydration they must carry enough water for six days. But most pack animals can only carry five times their own water, so that makes long-distance travel across such terrain rather hard… This is where camels become worth their weight in gold, because they can forage at half speed and don’t need water.

EXAMPLE: A 15 stone adventurer with light (5 stone) encumbrance mounted on a camel weighs 20 stone. The camel has 10 stones of normal load left. Assuming the camel moves at only half speed and is given time to graze each day, it can feed itself, so the other 10 stone can be put towards the adventurer’s ration, giving him 10 days of food and water. A camel at half speed can move 15 miles per day, so the adventurer can push through 150 miles of barrens or desert. Not coincidentally, the Sahara Desert has about 90 oases across its expanse each situated about 150 miles apart from each other.

### Weathering the Wild

Every adventurer setting out on an expedition hopes for warm dry days with a gentle breeze. Few are so lucky and many find their expeditions halted or even lost to bad weather. The Judge determines the prevailing weather for each day of the expedition. The effects of weather depend on the specific weather condition. Some sample weather conditions are detailed below. Spells such as *control weather*, *control winds*, and *summon weather* can be invaluable to adventurers confronting bad weather.

###### Frigid Temperatures

Frigid temperatures occur at 0° F and below. Adventurers in frigid temperature have their expedition speed halved and cannot forage. If the adventurer goes without protective clothing for more than six turns, or if he gets wet, he becomes **hypothermic**. A hypothermic adventurer cannot force march or heal wounds naturally and loses 1d3 CON each hour until the condition ends or his CON reaches 0, at which point he dies. The conditions end if the adventurer is able to warm himself by a campfire or other large heat source for at least one hour. An adventurer who becomes hypothermic or who suffers cold damage on any day must make a Death saving throw at the end of the day. If the save fails, he is frostbitten and must roll 1d6 on the 16-20 row of the Savage Mortal Wounds table (p. XX), possibly losing fingers, toes, an ear, or even his nose. An adventurer cannot rest under frigid temperatures unless he has both protective clothing or blankets and a campfire or other large heat source. An adventurer who endures frigid temperatures for seven consecutive days has a 10% chance of catching a disease unless immune. An adventurer who is resistant or invulnerable to cold damage suffers none of the above effects except the risk of disease.

###### Cold Temperatures

Cold temperatures are above 0° F and below 32° F. If the adventurer goes without protective clothing for more than four hours (24 turns), or if he gets wet, he becomes **hypothermic**. A hypothermic adventurer cannot force march or heal wounds naturally and loses 1d3 CON each hour until the condition ends or his CON reaches 0, at which point he dies. The conditions end if the adventurer is able to warm himself by a campfire or other large heat source for at least one hour. An adventurer who becomes hypothermic or who suffers cold damage on any day must make a Death saving throw at the end of the day. If the save fails, he is frostbitten and must roll 1d6 on the 16-20 row of the Savage Mortal Wounds table (p. XX), possibly losing fingers, toes, an ear, or even his nose. An adventurer cannot rest under frigid temperatures unless he has either protective clothing or blankets or a campfire or other large heat source. An adventurer who endures cold temperatures for seven consecutive days has a 5% chance of catching a disease unless immune. An adventurer who is resistant or invulnerable to cold damage suffers none of the above effects except the risk of disease.

###### Sweltering Temperatures

Sweltering temperatures are 95° F and higher. Adventurers in sweltering weather have their expedition speed halved. An adventurer wearing 5 stone or more of armor must make a Death saving throw each hour. If the throw fails, the adventurer becomes **fatigued** until he sheds his armor for at least one hour**. (**The adventurer can avoid this penalty by removing parts of his armor to reduce its encumbrance to less than 5 stone.) An adventurer’s required water ration is increased by 25%. If he becomes **dehydrated**, he loses 2d6 CON each day rather than 1d6. An adventurer who is resistant or invulnerable to fire damage suffers none of the above effects.

###### Moderate Temperatures

Moderate temperatures are above 32° F and below 95° F. Moderate temperatures have no effect on gameplay. In the ***ACKS II Judges Journal***, moderate temperatures are sub-divided into a range from very chilly to hot, but this is purely narrative.

###### Drizzly Conditions

Drizzly conditions represent either short rain showers periodically through the day or light but continuous rainfall of about ¼” per day. Mud forms after three days of Drizzly conditions. Foraging proficiency throws to find firewood suffer a -2 penalty.

###### Fair Conditions

Fair conditions encompass any other type of precipitation condition that is not drizzly, foggy, flurry, rainy, snowy, or sunbaked. Chill days punctuated by short showers might make adventurers miserable, and warm days with gentle breezes might make adventurers happy, but neither has any game effect.

###### Flurry Conditions

Flurry conditions represent either periodic snow showers or light but continuous snow flurries at a rate of about 1/2” per day. Foraging proficiency throws to find firewood suffer a -2 penalty. Snow forms after three days of Flurry conditions.

###### Foggy Conditions

Foggy conditions can arise from hazy mist, dense fog, or even smoke. During foggy conditions, maximum visibility distance drops to 20’ (which has a major effect on encounter distance, see p. XX). Land Surveying, Navigation, Searching, and Tracking proficiency throws also suffer a -4 penalty. Adventurers in foggy conditions have their speeds halved for all purposes. The Judge can increase or decrease the visibility and proficiency penalties to represent dense smog, light mist, etc.

###### Rainy Conditions

Rainy conditions bring heavy or violent precipitation of at least 1” per day. During rainy conditions, maximum visibility distance drops to half range, all missile attacks suffer a -2 penalty, and earthen roads provide no benefit. Land Surveying, Navigation, and Searching proficiency throws suffer a -2 penalty. Foraging proficiency throws to find firewood suffer a -4 penalty. Tracking proficiency throws suffer a -4 penalty per hour. An adventurer who endures rainy conditions for seven consecutive days has a 10% chance of catching a disease.

###### Snowy Conditions

Snowy conditions bring heavy snowfall of at least 10” per day. During snowy weather, maximum visibility distance drops to 20’. Adventurers in snowy weather have their speed halved for all purposes. Land Surveying, Navigation, and Searching proficiency throws suffer a -4 penalty. Foraging proficiency throws to find firewood suffer a -4 penalty. Tracking proficiency throws suffer a -4 penalty per hour. Snow accumulates after a day of snowy weather. An adventurer who endures snowy conditions for seven consecutive days has a 10% chance of catching a disease unless immune to disease.

###### Sunbaked Conditions

Sunbaked conditions have clear skies with bright strong sunlight. Foraging proficiency throws to find water suffer a -4 penalty. Adventurers without protective clothing suffer 1 fire damage if they travel or work outdoors for 4 or more hours. Adventurers with the Savage Resilience class power never get sunburned, they just get dark and bronze.

###### Stormy Conditions

Storm conditions prevail when wind speeds are 50mph or more. During storm conditions, all missile attack throws and Listening proficiency throws suffer a -4 penalty. Adventurers in stormy conditions have their expedition speed quartered. The force of the windautomatically extinguishes any candles, torches, or other unprotected flames. It extinguishes protected flames unless the bearer succeeds on a Paralysis saving throw. All characters are affected each round as if by the spell *gale of wind.* In barrens or desert terrain only, maximum visibility distance is reduced to 20’ and Land Surveying, Navigation, Searching, and Tracking proficiency throws all suffer -4 penalties due to sand storms and dust clouds.

###### Windy Conditions

Windy conditions prevail when wind speeds are between 25 and 50mph. During windy conditions, all missile attack throws and Listening proficiency throws suffer a -2 penalty. Adventurers in windy conditions have their expedition speed halved. Air speed is halved in any terrain in windy conditions. In barrens or desert terrain only, visibility is reduced to 20’, all speeds are halved, and Land Surveying, Navigation, Searching, and Tracking proficiency throws all suffer -4 penalties due to sand storms and dust clouds.

###### Mud and Snow

Mud accumulates after one day of Rainy or three days of Drizzly conditions in grasslands or scrublands terrain. Once mud forms, adventurers have their speeds halved for all purposes unless traveling on paved roads. Earth and gravel roads provide no benefit in mud and wheeled vehicles cannot move in mud except on paved roads. Mud dries in one day of sweltering fair weather, or seven days of moderate fair weather and freezes in one day of cold or frigid fair weather.

Snow accumulates after one day of Snowy or three days of Flurry conditions. Once snow accumulates, adventurers have their speeds halved for all purposes. Roads provide no benefit and wheeled vehicles cannot move in snow. Snow melts in seven days of moderate temperatures or one day of sweltering temperatures, creating mud (as above).

### Rest and Recuperation

After each 12-hour day of a wilderness expedition, characters need 8 hours of restful sleep. Most adventuring parties organize themselves into three 4-hour watches, so that each character can take 4 hours of watch while still getting 8 hours of sleep. Characters become **fatigued** after one day of ordinary travel or other strenuous activity if they do not get restful sleep. Even with restful sleep, characters become fatigued after six days of ordinary travel or one day of forced marching. A fatigued character suffers a cumulative -1 penalty on attack throws, proficiency throws, saving throws, and damage rolls each day until the condition ends. The condition is ended when the character rests as his dedicated activity for a day and gets 8 hours of restful sleep.

Adventurers with Labor proficiency do not become fatigued from ordinary travel or other strenuous activity. They still become fatigued after a day of force marching. Adventurers with Endurance proficiency can go a day without having to rest, plus one additional day for each point of Constitution bonus. If the adventurer has both Endurance and Labor proficiency, he can go one additional day. Note that most animals, except for steppe ponies, do not have Endurance so they will become fatigued even if the adventurer does not.

###### Sleeping with Equipment

Characters should reduce their encumbrance to 0 to guarantee restful sleep. Characters who sleep in armor or otherwise do not lay down their arms, armor, and equipment must make a throw of greater than their encumbrance or the sleep is not restful. It takes 1 full round to don one stone worth of armor or equipment.

## Encounters

The world of ***ACKS***is filled with creatures of every sort. The vast majority, however, are ordinary animals such as badgers, crows, deer, doves, ferrets, goats, rabbits, sheep, squirrels, and so on. While the adventurers will inevitably come across many such critters, these meetings are not encounters — they’re window dressing placed by the Judge to bring the setting to life. An **encounter** is a significant moment where the adventurers come into contact with monsters that can help or harm them.

During an encounter, the unit of time shifts from hours or turns into rounds, as the action “zooms in” on the actions of the adventurers and monsters in the moment. The two sides are assumed to be **opponents** unless and until determined otherwise by their interaction.

### Encounter Distance

When an encounter occurs, the adventurers and the monsters begin at **encounter distance**. In the shadowy corridors of a dungeon they might only be a few feet apart, but in the vast plains of Skysostan they might be hundreds of feet distant. Encounter distance has implications for surprise (discussed below) because sometimes one side might encounter the other at a distance from which the other side cannot see it.

When determining encounter distance, different rules apply for deliberate and random encounters. A deliberate encounter is one where the Judge knows exactly where the adventurers and monsters are located on his map and can determine from that where and when an encounter occurs. A random encounter is one where a random roll has said that an encounter does occur, and the Judge is retro-causally determining what the circumstances of position and terrain must be for that to happen.

###### Dungeon Encounters

When an arranged encounter occurs (such as adventurers kicking down the door to a room the Judge has stocked with orcs), the Judge contextually determines the encounter distance based on the layout of the dungeon, the available light sources, the description of the room, and the direction by which the adventurers or monster(s) approached.

When a random encounter occurs in a dungeon, the Judge will roll 2d6 x 10 to determine the maximum encounter distance in feet at the start of the encounter. He will choose or randomly roll for the direction from which the monsters approach. He then will reduce the distance (using his dungeon map as a guide) until either the monster(s) can see the adventurers or adventurers’ light source, or the adventurers can see the monster(s) or their light source (if any).

###### Wilderness Encounters

Encounters in the wilderness can take place in a variety of terrain types with greatly varying line of sight. Even “flat” terrain often has shrubbery, small dips, low rises, and other geography that conceal creatures.

When a deliberate encounter occurs in the wilderness, it will be handled by the Judge in the same fashion as in dungeons based on the map of the area, the available light sources, the description of the area, and the direction of approach.

When a random encounter occurs in the wilderness, the Judge will roll on the Wilderness Encounter Distance table to randomly determine the maximum encounter distance in feet at the start of the encounter. The encounter will then occur at either the maximum encounter distance or the maximum visibility distance (p. XX), whichever is less. The maximum encounter distance accounts for geography and foliage, while the maximum visibility distance accounts for lighting and weather conditions. The Judge will then choose or randomly determine the direction of approach based on the terrain.

Note that because formations in the wilderness are generally only 5 men or 3 horses wide, they might extend over hundreds of feet in depth. Encounter distance will be the distance to the closest part of the formation; distant parts of the formation might not be able to see or hear what’s going on.

**Altitude and Elevation:** When flying creatures are encountered in any terrain, the creatures can start at an altitude of up to one-half the encounter distance. When encountering non-flyers in mountains terrain, the opposing sides begin separated by an elevation of one-half the encounter distance. The Judge determines which side is higher based on the context, geography, and stated plans of the adventurers.

**Maximum Visibility Distance:** As noted under Visibility in the Wild (p. XX), the maximum distance at which individual man-sized creatures can be in line of sight is 600’ in daylight, 300’ in full moonlight, 150’ in half-moonlight, and 75’ in starlight. Party-sized formations (10 – 30 men) increase visibility distance by +50%. Platoon-sized formations (31 – 60 men) increase it +100%. Company-sized formations (61 – 240 men) increase it by +200%. Battalion or larger formations (241+ men) increase it by +400%. Count each mounted man or large creature as 2 men, each huge creature as 6 men, each gigantic creature as 24 men, and each colossal creature as 120 men. Maximum visibility distance should be calculated separately for each side in the encounter, making it possible for a small group to spot a large formation from far off. Maximum visibility distance usually only matters in wide-open terrain like desert or plains, where line of sight is otherwise unlimited.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Wilderness Encounter Distance** | |
| **Terrain**  **Type** | **Max (Average)**  **Encounter Distance** |
| Barrens (any) | 4d6 x 30’ (420’) |
| Desert (rocky) | 6d20 x 30’ (1890’) |
| Desert (sandy) | 4d6 x 30’ (420’) |
| Forest (deciduous) | 5d8 x 3 (68’) |
| Forest (taiga) | 3d6 x 15’ (157’) |
| Grassland (farmland/prairie) | 4d6 x 30’ (420’) |
| Grassland (steppe) | 6d20 x 30’ (1890’) |
| Hills (forested) | 5d8 x 3’ (68’) |
| Hills (rocky/terraced) | 4d6 x 30’ (420’) |
| Jungle (any) | 5d4 x 3’ (38’) |
| Mountains (forested) | 5d8 x 3’ (68’) |
| Mountains (rocky/snowy/terraced) | 4d6 x 30’ (420’) |
| Scrubland (low, sparse) | 4d6 x 30’ (420’) |
| Scrubland (high, dense) | 3d6 x 15’ (157’) |
| Swamp (marshy) | 3d6 x 15’ (157’) |
| Swamp (scrubby) | 5d8 x 3’ (68’) |
| Swamp (forested) | 5d4 x 3’ (38’) |

EXAMPLE: A party of adventurers is exploring the Skysostan steppe when it has a random encounter with a colossal dragon. The Judge rolls 6d20 x 30 with a result of 1,710’. That exceeds the maximum visibility distance of 600’ for man-sized creatures. However, there are 20 adventurers and henchmen, all mounted on light horses. Therefore, the formation counts as 40 men, making it platoon-sized. This increases the maximum distance at which they are visible to the dragon by +100% to 1,200’. Since the dragon is a colossal creature, it counts as a 120-man company, increasing the distance at which it is visible to the adventurers by +200% to 1,800’. That’s greater than the maximum encounter distance. Therefore, the encounter begins at 1,710’ with the adventurers having detected the dragon.

**Encounters Across Terrain Types:** Sometimes when an encounter occurs, the adventurers might be in one type of terrain while the monsters are in another type. When this occurs, the Judge will roll for wilderness encounter distance twice, once for each side based on their terrain type. The encounter begins at the greater of the two ranges rolled. The side which rolled the greater range counts as having detected the enemy, while the enemy counts as not having detected them.

EXAMPLE: A party of adventurers is moving through the forest in search of chaotic foes when they come upon a 300’ wide area of open parkland with a chthonic temple erected in the center. A number of cultists are engaging in a ritual sacrifice in the temple. The Judge determines the distance at which the cultists would encounter the adventurers using the adventurers’ terrain type (closed forest), and rolls 5d8 x 3. The result is 63’. The Judge determines the distance at which the adventurers would encounter the cultists using the cultists’ terrain type (open forest), and rolls 3d6 x 15. The result is 135’. Therefore the party is 135’ away from the cultists. The cultists have neither detection nor foreknowledge for an encounter.

**Senses Other than Sight:** Some characters or creatures might be able to detect opponents by means other than sight, such as acute hearing or olfaction, echolocation, etc. If so, do not reduce encounter distance due to visibility or light to less than the range of the sense.

EXAMPLE: A party of adventurers is traveling across highland moors (low sparse scrublands) during a foggy day (visibility reduced to 20’) when they have a random encounter with a white worm. The Judge rolls for the encounter distance and the result is 420’. Normally, he would reduce encounter distance to 20’ to reflect the foggy conditions. However, the white worm has mechanoreception that enables it to “see” through the fog. Therefore, the encounter distance is the rolled result of 420’.

### Surprise

Every adventurer aspires to be ready for anything at any moment. The vagaries of chance, the risk of distraction, and the fatigue of constant readiness all conspire to make adventurers drop their guard, sometimes at the worst possible moment. Fortunately, monsters are subject to the same caprice. The rules for **surprise** model the likelihood that when an encounter begins, some or all of the creatures involved are caught flat-footed and unready — sometimes leading to no encounter at all!

To adjudicate surprise, the Judge must first determine whether each side had **foreknowledge** of the presence of the other side, and whether each side currently has **line of sight** on some or all of the opposing side. The Judge then consults the Surprise Matrix, below.

* A side has foreknowledge if, just prior to the encounter, it detected the opponents by any means (sight, sound, smell, etc.).
* A side has line of sight if it can see one or more opponent(s) when the encounter begins.

|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Adventurers | Monsters | | | |
| *FORE, LOS* | *FORE* | *LOS* | *NONE* |
| *FORE, LOS* | Monsters not surprised  Adventurers not surprised  Adventurers cannot evade | Monsters roll surprise (+1)  Adventurers not surprised  Adventurers can evade | Monsters roll surprise  Adventures not surprised  Adventurers can evade | Monsters roll surprise (-1)  Adventurers not surprised  Adventurers can always evade |
| *FORE* | Monsters not surprised  Adventurers roll surprise (+1)  Adventurers cannot evade | Monsters roll surprise (+1)  Adventures roll surprise (+1)  Adventurers can evade | Monsters roll surprise  Adventurers roll surprise (+1)  Adventurers can evade | Monsters roll surprise (-1)  Adventurers roll surprise (+1)  Adventurers can evade |
| *LOS* | Monsters not surprised  Adventures roll surprise  Adventurers cannot evade | Monsters roll surprise (+1)  Adventurers roll surprise  Adventurers can evade | Monsters roll surprise  Adventurers roll surprise  Adventurers can evade | Monsters roll surprise (-1)  Adventurers roll surprise  Adventurers can evade |
| *NONE* | Monsters not surprised  Adventurers roll surprise (-1)  Adventurers cannot evade | Monsters roll surprise (+1)  Adventurers roll surprise (-1)  Adventurers cannot evade | Monsters roll surprise  Adventurers rolls surprise (-1)  Adventurers cannot evade | No encounter |

A result of **no encounter** means just that. A result of **not surprised** means that side (the adventurers or the monsters) is not surprised by the encounter. They both knew it was coming. A result of **roll surprise** means that side might be caught flat-footed. Each creature on that side must make a surprise roll (described below), with a modifier if indicated. In large encounters, the Judge might have the adventurers and/or monsters roll by side or in sub-groups to speed play.

A result of **adventurers cannot evade** means that the adventurers cannot avoid having the encounter. A result of **adventurers can evade** means that the adventurers might be able to avoid having the encounter by evading (see below). A result of **adventurers can always evade** means that the adventurers can automatically avoid having the encounter without need to roll. (If circumstances require, the Judge can check for the monsters to see if they can evade by pretending they are the adventurers and the adventurers are the real monsters.)

EXAMPLE: A party of adventurers hunting orcs listens at a door and hears orcs on the other side. They then kick open the door, beginning the encounter. When the encounter begins, the adventurers have foreknowledge and line of sight. The orcs have line of sight on the adventurers, but no foreknowledge. The adventurers are not surprised, while the monsters have to roll surprise.

To make a surprise roll, the player or Judge rolls 1d6, adds any relevant adjustments, and consults the Surprise table below:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Surprise** | |
| **Adjusted Die Roll** | **Result** |
| 2- | Surprised |
| 3 – 6+ | Attentive |

An **attentive** creature can act normally in the first round of the encounter. A **surprised** creature is **vulnerable** and cannot take any actions in the first round of the encounter.

Some creatures impose a penalty on the surprise rolls of their opponents. For instance, barbarians are naturally stealthy. Opponents suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls when encountering a barbarian approaching from outside line of sight or lying in wait in cover or darkness. When different creatures on one side impose different surprise penalties on their opponents, only the smallest penalty is applied. It only takes one clumsy oaf to ruin an ambush!

EXAMPLE: A fighter and a barbarian lie in wait for an approaching orc patrol. The barbarian is naturally stealthy, so he imposes a -2 penalty on surprise rolls. However, the fighter is not. Therefore, the orcs do not suffer the surprise penalty. If the barbarian was alone or in the company of other stealthy adventurers, the penalty would apply.

Other creatures gain a bonus when making surprise rolls, or even several bonuses. For instance, explorers have an Alertness class power and an Animal Reflexes class power that each grant a +1 bonus to avoid surprise, for a total of +2. Each creature applies its own bonus to its own roll. (If the Judge is handling surprise by groups, use the average bonus across the group.)

EXAMPLE: A patrol of orcs lie in wait for an explorer and a fighter. The explorer has a +2 bonus to avoid surprise. If the Judge runs the encounter with individual surprise, the explorer gets a +2 bonus on his surprise roll while the fighter gets no bonus. If the Judge runs the encounter with group surprise, both the explorer and fighter get a +1 bonus on their surprise rolls.

**The “I’ve Got a Bad Feeling About This” Memorial Rule:** Occasionally a situation can arise in which the presence of one side in an encounter is entirely unknown to the other side, but the other side has one or more combatants who are attentive (not **surprised**). In such circumstances, the attentive combatants are assumed to “have a bad feeling about this.” They might not be able to see or hear the danger, but they can intuit it. On their initiative segment, attentive combatants who haven’t yet observed any enemies can delay their initiative or use their initiative to move, defend, ready, and so on. The one thing they cannot do is claim line of sight or attack their unobserved enemies until they reveal themselves.

###### Surprise and Hiding

Some creatures are proficient in Hiding, a class power that enables them to hide when in cover, dim light, or darkness. In combat, hiding requires a combat action. When a creature begins hiding, the Judge must make a Hiding proficiency throw on its behalf. Regardless of whether the throw succeeds, opponents encountering the creature suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls against it. If the throw succeeds, the creature is **hidden**. If the throw fails, the creature is not hidden.

No creature can claim line of sight on a creature that is hidden from it. If a hidden creature engages an unengaged opponent, the opponent cannot make a free facing change. If an opponent knows the hidden creature’s general location, the opponent can attack it in melee at a -4 penalty, but it cannot even blindly attack the hidden creature if it doesn’t knows the creature’s general location. The hidden condition expires at the end of the hidden creature’s initiative if it moves or attacks. It also terminates if the cover, dim light, or darkness no longer conceals the thief from his opponents.

Hidden creatures are especially dangerous because they can ambush or backstab even highly alert targets, as the examples below illustrate.

EXAMPLE: A thief is lying in wait for an approaching patrol of four orcs. The thief makes a Hiding proficiency throw. The throw succeeds, and the thief is now hidden. When the orcs come into line of sight of the thief, an encounter occurs. The thief has foreknowledge and line of sight on the orcs, while the orcs have neither of those factors. Therefore the orcs must make surprise rolls at -1, while the thief is automatically ready. Because the thief is hiding, they suffer a further -2 penalty on those rolls, so they will fail on a roll of 1-5.

Let’s call the four orcs Abash, Bargo, Chogak, and Dugot. Abash, Bargo, and Chogak roll badly and become **surprised**. They cannot act in the round. Dugot rolls well and is not surprised. Because he’s not surprised, he is aware that somethingis happening but isn’t sure exactly what. Despite being ready, he cannot target or attack the thief until after the thief acts.

Since both are ready, Dugot and thief both roll for initiative. Let’s say Dugot has the higher initiative, so he gets to act first. Dugot says “Is something there?” as he glimpses a flickering shadow, then draws his sword and uses his action to ready an attack on any opponent who comes in range.

The thief lunges out of the darkness from behind Dugot to backstab him. Dugot is readied to attack, but he is not allowed to attack the thief until after the thief acts. If the thief’s backstab kills Dugot, Dugot will not get to attack, and the thief might be able to cleave into the remaining orcs, all of whom can also be backstabbed. If the thief doesn’t kill Dugot, however, Dugot’s readied attack will trigger.

EXAMPLE: It’s the same scene, but thief fails his Hiding proficiency throw so he does not enjoy the benefits of being hidden. When the orcs come into line of sight of the thief, an encounter occurs. The thief has foreknowledge and line of sight on the orcs, while the orcs have neither of those factors. Therefore the orcs must make surprise rolls while the thief is automatically ready. As before, Abash, Bargo, and Chogak end up surprised while Dugot is ready. And, as before, both Dugot and the thief roll for initiative, and Dugot acts first. Since the thief isn’t hidden, Dugot is eligible to attack him, and does so. If the thief survives Dugot’s attack, he could attack Dugot normally or backstab Abash, Bargo, or Chogak.

###### Surprise and Sneaking

Some creatures are proficient in Sneaking, a class power that enables them to move silently. In combat, sneaking is a movement action. Creatures can sneak at their encounter speed or one-half combat speed without penalty. If they move greater than one-half combat speed, they take a -5 penalty to the proficiency throw. If they run, they take a -10 penalty.

When a creature begins sneaking, the Judge make a Sneaking proficiency throw on behalf of the creature. Regardless of whether the throw succeeds, opponents suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls when encountering the creature if it is sneaking towards them from outside line of sight. If the throw succeeds, the creature is **sneaking**. If the throw fails, the creature is not.

A **sneaking** creature makes no noise when it moves — none whatsoever. Even alert creatures that make a successful Listening throw will not hear a sound. A sneaky creature can ambush or backstab an attentive opponent as if it were **surprised**, provided that it was not in the opponent’s line of sight at any point within the prior round.

A creature cannot combine hiding and sneaking in a single movement action, but it can sneak into cover or darkness with its movement action and then start hiding with its combat action.

###### Surprise and Sleeping

A creature which is taking restful sleep at the start of an encounter does not roll for surprise. Instead, it begins the encounter **slumbering**. The slumbering condition ends immediately if the slumbering creature is attacked, damaged, or moved.

Unless the slumbering condition is being maintained by magic, it ends automatically at the conclusion of the first combat round in which a noise is made loud enough to be within earshot were the slumbering creature awake.

### Evasion

Sometimes, the circumstances of an encounter might permit the adventurers to evade it entirely. Dungeon encounters occur at such close proximity that evasion is impossible. (The party can run away during the course of a combat, but that’s not evasion.)

In the wilderness, however, the adventurers can attempt to evade if the Surprise Matrix entry for the encounter listed a result of **adventurers can evade** and the adventurers did not end up **surprised**. If the monsters are all surprised, the attempt succeeds automatically. Otherwise, the adventurers must make an Evasion proficiency throw to avoid the encounter.

The target value for the proficiency throw is determined by the size of the evading party and the terrain they are in, as shown on the Evasion Throw by Terrain table. (Evasion at sea is handled separately, see **Voyages**.) When determining party size, count each mounted man or large creature as 2 men, each huge creature as 6 men, each gigantic creature as 24 men, and each colossal creature as 120 men.

If the proficiency throw succeeds, the party has evaded the encounter. If the proficiency fails, the party fails to evade and gameplay proceeds to Reactions. A failed evasion does not necessarily mean a fight!

|  |  |  |  |  |  |

| **Evasion Throw by Terrain** | | | | | |
| **Terrain Type** | **Party Size** | | | | |
| **6-** | **7 to 14** | **15 to 30** | **31 to 60** | **61+** |
| Barrens (sandy) | 12+ | 14+ | 16+ | 18+ | 20+ |

| Grassland (farm/prairie) | 9+ | 11+ | 13+ | 15+ | 17+ |
| Grassland (steppe) | 16+ | 18+ | 20+ | 22+ | 24+ |
| Hills (forested) | 5+ | 7+ | 9+ | 11+ | 13+ |
| Hills (rocky) | 12+ | 14+ | 16+ | 18+ | 20+ |
| Jungle (any) | 2+ | 4+ | 6+ | 8+ | 10+ |
| Mountains (forested) | 5+ | 7+ | 9+ | 11+ | 13+ |
| Mountains (rocky) | 12+ | 14+ | 16+ | 18+ | 20+ |
| Scrubland (sparse) | 12+ | 14+ | 16+ | 18+ | 20+ |
| Scrubland (dense) | 9+ | 11+ | 13+ | 15+ | 17+ |
| Swamp (marshy) | 9+ | 11+ | 13+ | 15+ | 17+ |
| Swamp (scrubby) | 5+ | 7+ | 9+ | 11+ | 13+ |
| Swamp (forested) | 2+ | 4+ | 6+ | 8+ | 10+ |

**Aerial Encounters:** If the monsters can fly and the adventurers cannot, the adventurers suffer a -4 penalty to its Evasion throw unless in forest, forested hills, forested mountains, dense scrubland, jungle, or swamp. If the adventurers can fly and the monsters cannot they can automatically evade the encounter.

**Explorers:** If an explorer guides a party in familiar territory, the party gains a +5 bonus to its Evasion throw. An explorer’s party can even evade wilderness encounters when **surprised** provided the explorer himself is not surprised. (If using group surprise, the Judge should roll separately for the explorer.) Otherwise, the only way to evade is to leave the surprised party member(s) behind.

**Forlorn Hope:** If a number of adventurers at least equal to the number of the monsters stay to fight, the rest of the group can evade using the reduced party size with an additional +4 bonus.

**Movement:** If the fastest monster has a faster movement rate than the slowest adventurer, the adventurers suffer a -4 penalty to their Evasion throw. If the slowest adventure has a faster movement rate than the fastest monster, the adventurers gain a +4 bonus.

**Sauve Qui Peut:** If necessary, the party can split up into separate groups, perhaps to abandon stragglers who are slowing them down or simply to improve the odds that any one group escapes. Calculate the party size for each group. Roll separately for each group to determine whether it can evade, applying any modifiers based only on that group’s composition. All of the groups that fail collectively share the encounter, which is assumed to occur before they managed to split up. Each group that succeeds goes its own way.

**Designer’s Note:** The reason that all groups that do not evade are placed into one encounter is to avoid forcing the Judge into running multiple concurrent battles with only a portion of the players at each time. The Judge can choose to do this if he wants, splitting the monsters up to pursue each group separately, but it’s not recommended.

EXAMPLE: A party of adventurers in the Skysostan steppe spots a colossal dragon on the hunt flying above them 1,710’ away. The dragon cannot see them from further than 1,200’ away, so it hasn’t yet detected them. The adventurers have LOS, while the dragon has neither LOS nor foreknowledge. Consulting the chart, the Judge sees that the adventurers can attempt to evade! First, however, the dragon must roll for surprise at -1. If the dragon is **surprised**, the party can automatically evade. Unfortunately, the surprise roll is a 6 and the dragon is attentive. Since it hasn’t yet actually spotted the adventurers, it just “has a bad feeling” – perhaps it caught hints of movement or caught a scent on the wind.

Since the dragon is attentive, the adventurers must make an Evasion proficiency throw if they want to avoid the encounter. There are 20 adventurers mounted on light horses, so they count as two men each; their party size is 40. In steppe terrain, the target value is a nigh-impossible 22+. On light riding horses, the party has a speed of 240’. The colossal dragon has a gem-encrusted hide slowing it to a speed of only 210’, so the adventurers gain a +4 bonus. They also are being led by their trusty Skysostan explorer Subutai, who grants them an additional +5 bonus. However, the dragon can fly, so they face a -4 penalty. Their final target value is 17+ -- a tough but not impossible roll.

What if the party splits up into eight groups of five? That would reduce the base target value from 22+ to 16+. The dragon’s flight and party’s speed would continue to cancel out (+4 – 4). Whichever group the explorer joined would get a +5 bonus. By splitting up, then, one group of five adventurers can evade on 11+ and the other seven groups can evade on 16+. The party splits up to maximize the chance that some of them survive.

###### Aftermath of Evasion

By definition, a party evading an encounter is hastily moving to a new location. When a party evades, the Judge will first roll on the Wilderness Encounter Distance table to determine how far they had to travel to escape. (The same modifiers for creature and party size apply.) He will then roll 1d12 to determine the clock direction of their movement. If the party split up into multiple groups, each group heads in its own random direction for its own random distance. (Two or more groups sharing the same direction share the same distance.)

If the Judge has a small-scale map of the wilderness area, he will plot the party’s movement on that map. The party might “evade” straight into a monster lair or point of interest. In random wilderness encounters, however, the area is only mapped in large scale, so the Judge might make an additional encounter throw instead (Judge’s discretion). The Judge will have to decide the exact nature of the location where the adventurers halt based on the overall geography and likely route.

Once the party (or group thereof) comes to a halt, it must immediately make a Navigation throw at -4 to see if it has gotten lost. If the throw succeeds, the party or group is aware of its location relative to its last known location. If the throw fails, the party or group is lost and knows it.

A lost party or a group can attempt to search for its last known landmark (ruined structure, river bank, road, trail, etc.) by making a Wilderness Searching throw as if it were a point of interest (p. XX). Unless the Judge determines otherwise due to peculiar circumstances, the last known landmark is identical for any and all lost groups, allowing them to rendezvous after getting lost. Remember that searching triggers an encounter throw!

A group that didn’t get lost, or a group that was lost but then found its last known landmark, can make a Wilderness Searching throw to find a lost group. Treat the lost group as a point of interest. If the lost party is moving or searching, there is a -4 penalty to the throw to find it. If a searching group tries and fails to find a lost group in the same hour that a lost group successfully finds the last known landmark, the two groups miss each other. The searching group ends the hour in the wilderness, unaware that the lost group has made it to the landmark; and the lost group ends the hour at the landmark, unaware that another group is searching for it. Of course, magic such as *clairvoyancy, scry,* and so on can make such challenges easier to overcome, and Tracking proficiency might enable them to spot each’s other trails.

Adventurers who evade might be tracked by some monsters, depending on their abilities and intent. The Passing Without Trace proficiency and spell can be very useful in avoiding having a hungry monster in pursuit.

###### Evasion by monsters

Sometimes the party might be of such impressive size or power that the monsters want to evade them. The ***ACKS II Judges Journal***offers guidelines for the Judge to determine when monsters might evade.

### Reactions

Sometimes, it’s obvious how an encounter is going to go. When an orc scales up a siege ladder and leaps onto the rampart, the defenders know it’s there to kill or be killed. Likewise, if an adventuring party bristling with weapons and wearing holy symbols of Law bursts into a den of chaotic creatures, the creatures know it’s time to fight. Sometimes, however, an encounter might occur without both sides immediately coming to blows.

In such cases, the Judge will make a **reaction roll** of 2d6 and determine the monsters’ reactions by consulting the Encounter Reaction table. A reaction roll is subject to a number of modifiers. The CHA adjustment of the party’s “face” (typically whichever has the highest CHA) is usually added to the roll. If the “face” has certain class powers and proficiencies, such as Mystic Aura, those might grant a bonus to the roll as well. Certain conditions and effects on the adventurer or monsters might also modify the roll. The Judge can apply a wide range of modifiers based on the circumstances in which the encounter takes place (these are in the ***ACKS II Judge’s Journal***). Regardless of modifiers, however, an unmodified roll of 2 is never better than unfriendly, and an unmodified result of 12 is never worse than indifferent.

Sometimes the adventurers might not have a clear “face,” or may disagree as to who their “face” ought to be. In this case, whichever adventurer is encountered by or speaks to the other side first is considered to be the “face.” The Judge can call for an initiative roll to determine who speaks first if it is unclear. If the context of the encounter is such that no social interaction could take place at all, then the Judge will roll on the Encounter Reaction table without any modifier from the “face.”

EXAMPLE: Tavus is a paladin (CHA 18, Mystic Aura, Intimidation, +5 total bonus) nominally leading a party of 1st level adventurers. One of his comrades is an explorer named Morne (CHA 7, -1 penalty). The party encounters a group of 5 orcs. Tavus tells the Judge, “I draw my sword and tell them to surrender or die.” Morne, who enjoys disrupting the paladin’s plans, immediately says “I show my bare hands and say “let’s talk!” The party erupts into dispute around the gaming table. The Judge calls for Tavus and Morne to each roll initiative. Morne wins, so he speaks first. The orcs consider him the spokesperson of the adventurers.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Encounter Reaction** | |
| **Adjusted Die Roll** | **Result** |
| 2- | Hostile, attacks |
| 3 – 5 | Unfriendly, may attack |
| 6 – 8 | Neutral, uncertain |
| 9 – 11 | Indifferent, uninterested |
| 12+ | Friendly, helpful |

A result of **hostile** means that the monsters immediately attack the adventurers. An **unfriendly** result means that the monsters do not like the adventurers, and will attack if it seems possible to win. A **neutral** result simply means that the monsters are uncertain about the encounter. If the adventurers are aggressive or appear dangerous, the monsters will act unfriendly, but if the adventurers seem peaceful and interested in parley, the monsters will act indifferent. An **indifferent** result means that monsters will ignore the adventurers if the adventurers ignore them, and parley with the adventurers if the adventurers act otherwise. A **friendly** result means that the monsters will seek to cooperate with the adventurers in mutually beneficial ways. An adventurer can recruit a friendly monster with fewer HD than his own by rolling on the Reaction to Hiring Offer table (p. XX). If successful, the monster might be recruited as a henchman (see **Hirelings**, **Henchmen**, **Mercenaries**, **and Specialists**).

EXAMPLE #1: If the party has bashed down the door leading into a den of orcs, no reaction roll is necessary. Orcs know what to do when murder hobos… er, heroes… come into their homes.

EXAMPLE #2: The party has entered a crypt guarded by a hungry spider. No reaction roll is necessary. The Judge purposefully placed a hungry spider on the ceiling of the crypt to spring on adventurers. He doesn’t now need to roll to decide if the spider has an existential crisis about eating non-arachnids.

EXAMPLE #3: The party was heatedly arguing about the dungeon map when it encountered a pack of orcs. Nobody quite knows what to do. The Judge should make a reaction roll for the orcs.

EXAMPLE #4: The party was on an expedition in Skysostan when it had a random encounter with a colossal dragon. The adventurers haven’t been hostile and the Judge isn’t sure if the dragon is a hungry man-eater or a clever wyrm starved for sapient conversation. He decides a reaction roll is called for.

###### Attempting to Influence Reactions

If the adventurers want to change the reactions of creatures they have encountered, they can attempt to **influence** the creatures. Attempting to influence a creature or group of creatures requires an opportunity to peacefully converse. Once combat begins, adventurers cannot attempt to influence creatures unless and until the creatures are required to make morale rolls.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Number of Attempts | Time Required |
| 1st Attempt to Influence | 1 round (1 minute) |
| 2nd Attempt to Influence | 1 turn (10 minutes) |
| 3rd Attempt to Influence | 6 turns (1 hour) |
| 4th Attempt to Influence | 8 hours (1 work-day) |
| 5th+ Attempts to Influence | 5 work-days (1 week) |

The amount of time an attempt to influence requires depends on how well the interacting individuals or groups know each other. The adjoining table shows the amount of game time that characters must spend at each stage of influence. Impressions between strangers can take shape withing just a few minutes of chat; persuading a foe of decades to join an alliance might take a day or a week of negotiation in a peace summit.

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Reaction Roll | Initial Interaction | Attempt to Influence |
| 2 | Hostile, attacks | Shift 2 attitudes towards Hostile |
| 3 – 5 | Unfriendly, may attack | Shift 1 attitude towards Hostile |
| 6 – 8 | Neutral, uncertain | Shift 1 attitude towards Neutral |
| 9 – 11 | Indifferent, uninterested | Shift 1 attitude towards Friendly |
| 12 | Friendly, helpful | Shift 2 attitudes towards Friendly |

After the adventurers have spent the time required for their influence attempt, the Judge will make another reaction roll to determine the effect of the attempt on the creatures. All of the usual modifiers apply. The result of the roll influences the creatures’ reactions.

If the result is hostile, the creatures’ reactions shift by two steps towards hostile. If the result is unfriendly, the creatures’ reactions shift by one step towards hostile. A neutral result shifts the creatures’ reactions one step towards neutral. An indifferent result shifts the creatures’ reactions one step towards friendly. A friendly result shifts the creatures’ reactions two steps towards friendly.

Adventurers cannot use the evasion mechanics once they’ve started interacting with the monsters. If you’re close enough to know if they’re happy to see you, you’re too close to evade. (They can still run away during combat, but this is resolved using the combat rules.)

If combat breaks out between the adventurers and the creature(s), the adventurers cannot attempt to influence the creatures until the adventurers lay down their weapons or the creatures are forced to make a morale check.

###### Offering Bribes

Adventurers attempting to influence creatures they’ve encountered might wish to offer a bribe to their target. As a general rule, a bribe equal to one week’s pay for the target provides a +1 bonus, a month’s pay provides a +2 bonus, and a year’s pay provides a +3 bonus on the reaction roll. However, if a character bribes a target and fails to move the reaction towards friendly, the target’s attitude shifts towards hostile by one step (or one additional step). An adventurer who fails to bribe an official will be charged with the crime of bribery (p. XX) if the target becomes unfriendly or hostile or if he rolls an unmodified 2.

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cost of Bribes | | | |
| Character Proficient? | +1 Bonus | +2 Bonus | +3 Bonus |
| Proficient | 1 day | 1 week | 1 month |
| Non-Proficient | 1 week | 1 month | 1 year |

An adventurer with Bribery proficiency is exceptionally skilled at bribing targets with gifts of money or merchandise. A bribe equal to one day’s pay for the target provides a +1 bonus, a week’s pay provides a +2 bonus, and a month’s pay provides a +3 bonus. If the Bribery fails, the target’s attitude is not shifted towards hostile, as the character has been so subtle in his offer that the refusal was painless. A character with Bribery proficiency is only charged with the crime if he rolls an unmodified 2.

## Combat

When adventurers have an encounter with monsters, it often results in **combat**. Participants in combat are called **combatants**. Using the following rules, you can resolve combat between scores of combatants. For larger scale battles with hundreds to thousands of combatants, see p. XX.

### Simulating Combat on the Battlemap

Combat in ***ACKS II***can be enjoyed as a tactical wargame on a battlemap (analog or virtual) with counters, figures, or tokens to represent the exact position of the combatants throughout the combat, or purely in the imagination via the “theater of the mind.” The following rules introduce certain concepts that are useful for tactical simulation on the battlemap.

For groups who prefer a more narrative experience, or who want to de-emphasize combat in favor of exploration and campaign activities, ***ACKS II***can easily be run using the “theater of the mind.” (We do it a lot, especially for small fights.) When running theater of the mind, it’s the Judge’s responsibility to track the location of the various combatants and to decide which are affected by spells, which are in range of missile fire, and so on. He also must decide how many attackers can strike at one opponent based on the terrain and positioning of the combatants, when an opponent is approaching from the rear, and other factors. Groups that prefer to fight combat in the theater of mind can skip this section of the rules.

###### Square Scale

Each square on the battlemap represent a 5’ x 5’ area. (When measuring along diagonals, count every two squares as 15’.) This is the ideal scale for ***ACKS II****,* because being within 5’ of an enemy can trigger the **engaged** condition (p. XX). A combatant in a square adjacent to the front of an enemy combatant will generally be engaged with that enemy.

###### ![](data:image/png;base64...)Combatant Frontage and Interval

By tradition, the miniatures and virtual tokens typically used for man-sized combatants occupy a 5’ x 5’ square on the battlemap. However, a 5’ frontage is considerably larger than most historical combatants occupied in battle. In actuality, a man-sized combatant armed with a large bludgeoning or slashing weapon requires a full 5’ square frontage, but a man-sized combatant armed with a small or medium weapon or piercing weapon only requires a 3’ frontage. Therefore, ***ACKS II***permits three such combatants to fight in formation along two adjacent 5’ squares. To represent this on the battlemap, place one combatant’s figure in one square, the second combatant’s figure in the other square, and the third combatant’s figure on the line between the two, as shown in the adjoining image.

![](data:image/png;base64...)Likewise, a 5’ interval between troops is considerably greater than many historical combat formations used. Man-sized combatants can actually organize into ranks at 3’ intervals. This narrow interval enables combatants in the second rank equipped with polearms or spears.to attack opponents in the enemy formation. Therefore, ***ACKS II***permits up to three ranks of man-sized combatants per 10’. To represent this on the battlemap, place a second-rank combatant’s figure so that its base is overlapping the base of the figure to its front. A second-rank combatant armed with a long weapon can then attack targets as if it were occupying the space of the figure to its front.

Small combatants occupy the same space on the battlemap as man-sized combatants (one 5’ x 5’ square). Tiny combatants are typically represented on the battlemap as swarms rather than as individual creatures. The ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual*** has rules for swarms.

Large, huge, gigantic, and colossal targets occupy more spaces on the battlemap. By default, large creatures take up 2 squares (2 x 1 or 1 x 2), huge creatures take up 4 squares (2 x 2), gigantic creatures take up 12 squares (4 x 3 or 3 x 4) and colossal creatures take up 60 squares or more (10 x 6 or 6 x 10). The image below shows the default space requirements for each size of combatant. The Judge can adjust these at his discretion depending on the creature’s actual length and width, body posture, the combat situation, etc. Sizes are listed for each monster in its entry in the ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual****.*

###### Facing, Field of View and Line of Sight

Each combatant on the battlemap has a **facing**, which represents its directional orientation, and a **field of view**, which represents the arc on the battlemap within which it can claim **line of sight** on other combatants. A combatant’s facing determines its **flanks** and **rear**, as shown on the image below. (Combatants larger than man-sized have the same facings, simply extending their front and rear squares by their frontage and their flanks by their depth.) A combatant’s field of view encompasses only his front and flank squares. Therefore, he does not have line of sight on units approaching from his rear, which can leave him **vulnerable** to certain attacks.

![](data:image/png;base64...)

###### Passage of Lines

A man-sized combatant can move through a space occupied by an ally or between spaces occupied by two adjacent allies. However, a man-sized combatant cannot move through two spaces occupied by three adjacent allies. The tight 3’ wide frontage prevents passage of lines. This forces combatants to decide if they want a looser battle line that permits traverse or a tighter formation that puts more fighting power per square.

A combatant larger than man-sized can move through spaces occupied by allies at least two size categories smaller, provided there are enough contiguous unoccupied spaces to accommodate at least one-half the combatant’s frontage. A combatant larger than man-sized can end its movement “overlapping” with allies provided there are enough unoccupied spaces to accommodate at least one-half of its base.

![](data:image/png;base64...)

EXAMPLE: Orm is an ancient dragon of colossal size with a frontage of 6 squares. A number of his orc minions have taken up positions in front of him (as shown on the adjoining image). Orm can move through the first rank of orcs, because there are at least 3 empty spaces, but not through the second rank. He can end his initiative overlapping with the orcs because at least one-half his base is in empty spaces.

### Round and Initiative

Combat is resolved in a series of sequential units of time called **rounds**. A round is a brief interval of time in which flurries of activity are punctuated by pauses and lulls. It can be as brief as 10 – 15 seconds and as long as a minute or two. During each round, each combatant gets an **initiative segment** (usually just called the combatant’s “initiative”)**,** during which he has an opportunity to take one or more actions. Thus a round consists of several initiative segments, while an entire combat might consist of several rounds.

### Round Sequence

During each round, gameplay proceeds through the following steps.

1. **Pre-Initiative Declarations.** Combatants wishing to cast spells or engage in **defensive movement** (i.e. undertake the retreat or withdraw actions) in the upcoming round must publicly inform the Judge before the initiative dice are rolled. Other actions do not have to be declared in advance.
2. **Initiative Rolls.** After pre-initiative declarations, each combatant rolls 1d6 to determine his **initiative number**. This roll can be adjusted by the combatant’s DEX modifier, if any, and by certain special abilities or proficiencies. In larger combats, the Judge might roll 1d6 for each party-sized group of identical monsters instead of for each individual monster. Initiative number determines when a combatant acts during the round.
3. **Initiative Count.** The Judge begins calling out the initiative numbers starting with 10, then 9, then 8, and so on. Each combatant takes his initiative segmentwhen his initiative number is called. The initiative count continues until characters have acted or until it reaches -10, at which point the initiative count ends.
4. **Morale.** When the initiative count concludes, the Judge checks morale for any combatants who have suffered enough damage and/or lost enough allies that they might withdraw or flee. If all combatants on one side have been defeated, the combat ends. Otherwise another round begins.

###### Acting Before Initiative Number

There are three circumstances during which a combatant can act before his initiative number:

* **Readied to Attack:** If a combatant begins the round with a readied combat action (p. XX), he can take his readied combat action when it is triggered, regardless of his own initiative number. A readied combat action takes place at the end of the movement actions of the opponent that triggered his readied action, or at the last point of their movement where the opponent would disappear from view, beforehis combat action. A combatant who takes a readied combat action can act normally when his initiative segment occurs later in that round.
* **Readied Missile Weapon on First Round:** If, at the start of the first round of combat, a combatant was unengaged, had a missile weapon equipped, and was not surprised, he can interrupt to fire at a charging opponent on the charging opponent’s initiative number regardless of his own initiative number, as if he were readied. The combatant’s attack takes place just before the charging opponent’s attack. The combatant loses his initiative number whether or not his attack hits. However, the combatant can cleave after the attack (p. XX) if it kills his opponent.
* **Readied Long Melee Weapon on First Round** If, at the start of the first round of combat, a combatant was unengaged, had a long melee weapon equipped, and was not surprised, he can interrupt to attack at a charging opponent on the charging opponent’s initiative number regardless of his own initiative number, as if he were readied. The combatant’s attack takes place just before the charging opponent’s attack. The combatant cannot interrupt the charging opponent if it is of a bigger size category or is also equipped with a long melee weapon. The combatant loses his initiative number whether or not his attack hits. However, the combatant can cleave after the attack (p. XX) if it kills his opponent.

In all three cases, a combatant who was readied loses his opportunity to act if he takes damage, fails a saving throw, or is involuntarily moved before he uses his readied action.

EXAMPLE: Augilar is equipped with a spear. His comrade Skandara is equipped with a composite bow. They are facing three orcs, two equipped with spears and one with a great axe, all 30’ away. At the start of the first combat round neither Augilar nor Skandara is **engaged** or **surprised**. Augilar’s initiative number is 1, Skandara’s initiative number is 3, and the orcs’ initiative numbers are 4 (axe), 5 (spear), and 6 (spear). On initiative count 6, the first spear-armed orc charges Skandara. Skandara interrupts the orc’s attack to shoot it with her bow. Her attack wounds the orc, which then attacks her and misses. On initiative count 5, the second spear-armed orc charges Augilar. Augilar cannot interrupt because the orc has a spear. Fortunately, it misses. On initiative count 4, the axe-armed orc charges Augilar. Augilar interrupts the orc’s attack to stab it with his spear.

**Designer’s Note:** ***ACKS II*** uses sequential initiative over the course of rounds, rather than a second-by-second adjudication of action. This can create anomalies where a creature charges hundreds of feet across a battlefield into the face of spearmen or archers who just stand there for the greater part of the round. The Readied on First Round rules address this edge case

###### Engagement

A combatant that is facing an opponent within 5’ **engages** that opponent unless either (or both) the combatant and the enemy are hidden from the other or are protected by particular magic that prevents engagement (e.g. *sanctuary*). A combatant treats an enemy that does not engage it as if it were an ally for movement purposes.

EXAMPLE: Augilar, Ravila, and Skandara are 5’ away from an orc. The orc is facing Augilar and Ravila. Augilar is facing the orc, but Ravila has the orc to her rear (i.e. she’s facing the wrong direction). Skandara is facing the orc from the orc’s rear. Ravila is protected by a *sanctuary* spell. Therefore Augilar and Skandara have both engaged the orc. The orc has engaged Augilar. Ravila is not engaged by the orc because of her *sanctuary* spell. The orc is not engaged by Ravila both because it is to her rear and because of her *sanctuary* spell. Skandara is not engaged by the orc because she is to its rear.

Sometimes a combatant might engage an opponent that is not facing it. If the opponent is not already engaged and the combatant is not **sneaking**, the opponent can make a free facing change, turning to face the combatant that just engaged it, before any attack takes place. This permits the opponent to engage the combatant, avoid being **vulnerable** and, possibly, to take a readied action.

Engaged combatants are restricted in the actions they can take. They cannot use a full-round action to charge, run, or running sneak. They cannot use a movement action to march, sneak, stand up, or take cover. They cannot use a combat action to march. Creatures in flight cannot be engaged by creatures incapable of flight.

EXAMPLE: Let’s assume that Ravila were not protected by *sanctuary*. She would be engaged by the orc. Because Ravila is not engaged to her front, she could immediately change her facing to put the orc to her front. The orc cannot change its facing to prevent Skandara from backstabbing it, because the orc is engaged by Augilar.

**Engagement by Smaller or Larger Creatures (optional):** While a man can physically keep another man from passing him, that same man cannot necessarily stop an elephant from moving where it wants. However, a single titan or a phalanx of men might be able to prevent an elephant from passing. When such situations arise, the Engagement by Smaller or Larger Creatures table can be used to decide if a combatant is engaged. It shows the number of opponents of a given size that must be within 5’ of a single creature of a given size in order to engage it. If less than this number are present, the combatant can simply pass through the opponents as if they were allies. However, it cannot end its move overlapping (sharing space) with opponents unless it has some special ability that might permit that. These rules are optional and will be used at the Judge’s discretion when necessary to adjudicate gameplay.

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Engagement by Smaller or Larger Creatures | | | | | | |
| Engaging Creature Size | **Small**  **Opponent** | **Man-Sized**  **Opponent** | **Large**  **Opponent** | **Huge**  **Opponent** | **Gigantic**  **Opponent** | **Colossal**  **Opponent** |
| Small | 1 creature | 1 creature | 2 creatures | 2 creatures | 3 creatures | 4 creatures |
| Man-Sized | 1 creature | 1 creature | 2 creatures | 2 creatures | 3 creatures | 4 creatures |
| Large | 1 creature | 1 creature | 1 creature | 1 creature | 2 creatures | 3 creatures |
| Huge | 1 creature | 1 creature | 1 creature | 1 creature | 1 creature | 2 creatures |
| Gigantic | 1 creature | 1 creature | 1 creature | 1 creature | 1 creature | 2 creatures |
| Colossal | 1 creature | 1 creature | 1 creature | 1 creature | 1 creature | 1 creature |

![](data:image/png;base64...)

EXAMPLE: Orm is an ancient dragon of colossal size with a frontage of 6 squares. He cannot be engaged by less than 4 man-sized creatures. He can thus move through the first rank of legionaries as if they were allies. Once he starts moving over the legionaries he must continue moving so that he does not end his movement overlapping with them. When Orm reaches the second rank of legionaries, he is engaged and his movement ends. Had the second rank of legionaries been closer, Orm would not have been able to pass through the first rank. The image below illustrates the situation.

###### Delaying Actions

On a combatant’s initiative segment, the combatant can choose to **delay** until a lower initiative count, up to a maximum equal to the negative value of his initiative number. For instance, a character with an initiative number of 5 can delay his action until the initiative count reaches -5. If the character does not take his initiative segment at that time, he loses the ability to act that round.

A delaying combatant can take his actions when the count reaches a lower initiative number of his choice, or can wait for another combatant to act. If a combatant waits for a particular character, then the combatant’s action takes place just after that character on the same initiative number.

Effects triggered at the start of a character’s initiative take place before he delays. Effects triggered at the end of a character’s initiative (such as a spell he is casting) take place at the end of his initiative segment, or at the end of the round if he does not ever act.

EXAMPLE: Quintus is currently the victim of a *bloody flux*spell. According to the spell, the victim of this spell takes 1d12 extraordinary necrotic damage and must make a Death saving throw at the start of its initiative. Quintus rolled a 4 for initiative. Balbus, who can dispel *bloody flux,* only rolled a 2. When initiative count of 4 is called, Quintus announces he is delaying until after Balbus acts. Unfortunately, Quintus cannot delay the effect of the spell on him. He takes the damage and must make the Death saving throw, even though he’s not acting yet.

###### Simultaneous Initiative

If two more combatants have the same initiative number, those combatants act sequentially. They do not take their actions simultaneously. If the two combatants are on the same side, they may choose the order they act. If the combatants are on opposite sides, the side with fewer members can have some or all of its combatants act before or after the other side. If the sides have equal numbers of troops, then the side run by the Judge (the monsters) can have some or all of its combatants act before or after the other side.

### Actions

During his initiative segment, each combatant can take one full-round action; two movement actions; or one movement action and one combat action. The combatant must use his movement action before he uses his combat action. He cannot substitute one action for the other, or use the combat action before the movement action.

###### Full Round Actions

Full-round actions include:

**Cast Spell:** Remain stationary and cast a spell either from the caster’s repertoire or from a scroll in hand. The combatant must have declared the spell before initiative. If the combatant takes damage or fails a saving throw at any point during the round before casting, the casting is disrupted. The action and the spell are lost when this occurs.

**Charge:** Charge an opponent in line of sight at up to running speed. The combatant must not be **engaged** at the start of his charge. The charge must be in a straight line towards the intended target and the path to the target must be clear. If the charging combatant does not have line of sight to the opponent at the start of the charge, that opponent can’t be charged. The charging combatant is **disordered** (-2 penalty to AC) until the start of his next initiative. After charging, a combatant can make a melee attack with a +2 bonus on his attack throw on the target he charged and on subsequent cleaves provided he takes a 5’ step after each cleave. Impact weapons, such as spears, lances, and polearms, deal additional damage on a successful charge. The natural attacks of certain monsters sometimes count as impact weapons.

**Don/Remove Armor:** Don or remove 1 stone of armor. This action can be repeated over several rounds to don or remove suits of armor entirely. For instance, it takes 6 full-round actions to don or remove ordinary plate armor.

**Hastily Lockpick:** Attempt to hastily lockpick a door, chest, or other locked object within 5’ of the combatant.

**Hastily Search:** Attempt to hastily search the area within 5’ of the combat, or within 10’ if equipped with a long pole.

**Hastily Trapbreak:** Attempt to hastily disable a trap within 5’ of the combatant.

**Fire/Reload Artillery:** Make an attack with artillery within 5’ or reload artillery that has attacked.

**Run:** Run in a straight line or gradual curve at up to running speed. The combatant must not be **engaged** when he starts running. The running combatant is **disordered** (-2 penalty to AC) until the start of his next initiative. After running, a combatant can take cover if he is not engaged.

**Running Sneak:** Swiftly and sneakily hustle in a straight line or gradual curve at up to running speed. The combatant suffers a -10 penalty to its Sneaking proficiency throw. The combatant must not be **engaged** when it starts sneaking.

**Retreat:** Run away from engaging enemies at up to running speed. The combatant must have begun the round engaged and declared the retreat before rolling initiative unless he has Skirmishing. When the retreat begins, the combatant must change his facing to the desired direction of retreat, and thereafter cannot change his facing during the retreat. While retreating, the combatant can ignore engagement by any enemies that had him engaged at the start of the retreat. However, when his retreat is complete, the combatant must not remain engaged with any of the enemies that he had been engaged with. If the configuration of troops or terrain on the battlefield makes this impossible, then the combatant cannot retreat. A retreating combatant can still engage, and become engaged and forced to halt by, new enemies that he encounters during his retreat. A retreating combatant is **disordered** (-2 penalty to AC) until the start of his next initiative segment. Retreating is a type of defensive movement.

**Spike a Door:** Hammer a spike into a door within 5’ of the combatant.

###### Movement Actions

On its initiative segment, a combatant that did not take a full-round action can take one or two movement actions. If the combatant only takes one movement action, it can then take a combat action afterwards. Movement actions include:

**Action in Lieu of Movement:** Take a simple action requiring a few moments. A combatant can:

* Grab a helpless creature, either completely or just by the limbs, within 5’. The creature’s weight and encumbrance is added to the combatant’s encumbrance if he picks it up entirely. Otherwise half its weight and encumbrance is added to his encumbrance. The creature can be grabbed (and subsequently moved) even if it is engaged by enemies within 5’ provided the combatant is not himself engaged.
* Give a complex or extensive order to a creature or creatures. Simple orders (“protect me!”) do not require an action.
* Light an equipped lantern, torch, or oil flask.
* Mount or dismount a stationary or moving mount or vehicle (if proficient).
* Open an unlocked, unstuck door, or pull aside a curtain.
* Pick an item off the ground and equip it.
* Ready or loosen a shield.
* Retrieve an item from a backpack, rucksack, or sack and equip it. (Retrieving an item from an adventurer’s harness, belt pouch, bowcase, quiver, or sheath does not require an action in lieu of movement.)
* Sheathe a weapon and draw another. (Dropping a weapon rather than sheathing it and drawing a new one does not require an action in lieu of movement.)
* Perform another simple action that the rules or Judge permit.

**March:** Movein any desired direction (including to the flank or rear) at up to combat speed. The combatant can change facing as many times as desired while marching and end facing in any direction. The combatant must not be **engaged** at the start of the march.

**Remain Stationary/Change Facing:** Hold fast, not moving in any direction. A combatant who is remaining stationary can, however, change his facing in order to pick a more advantageous orientation.

**Sneak:** Move in a stealthy manner at up to one-half combat speed, or at combat speed with a -5 penalty on the Sneaking throw. The combatant must be proficient in Sneaking to take this action.

**Stand Up:** Stand up if prone. The combatant must not be **engaged**.

**Take Cover:** Take cover by falling prone, crouching, kneeling, etc. The combatant must not be **engaged**.

**Withdraw:** Move away from engaging enemies at up to half combat speed. The combatant can change facing as many times as desired while withdrawing and can end facing in any direction. While withdrawing, the combatant can ignore engagement by any enemies that had him engaged at the start of the withdrawal. When his withdrawal is complete, the combatant must not remain engaged with any of the enemies that he had been engaged with. If the configuration of troops or terrain on the battlefield makes this impossible, then the combatant cannot withdraw. A withdrawing combatant can still engage, and become **engaged** and forced to halt by, new enemies that he encounters during his withdrawal. To take a withdrawal, the combatant must begin the round engaged and declare the withdrawal before rolling initiative, unless he has Skirmishing. Withdrawal is a type of defensive movement.

###### Combat Actions

On its initiative segment, a combatant that did not take a full-round action or two movement actions can take a combat action.

**Action in Lieu of Attacking:** Take a moderately complex action requiring some interaction with the world or other combatants. With an action in lieu of attacking, a combatant can:

* Apply a healing herb, oil, or salve to himself, a willing or helpless combatant, or an equipped or stationary object.
* Brandish a holy symbol, garlic, or mirror.
* Cast a spell from a rod, staff, wand, or ring.
* Cleanse himself or a willing or helpless combatant of acid or oil by pouring out a waterskin of water.
* Drink a potion or pour a potion down a helpless combatant’s throat.
* Mount or dismount a stationary mount or vehicle.
* Unlock a door using a key.
* Use an equipped item for non-combat purposes.
* Perform an action in lieu of moving (from the list above).
* Perform another moderately complex action that the rules or Judge permit.

**Attack**: Attack one or more times, based on attack sequence. If the combatant remained stationary and is not **engaged**, he may move up to 5’ towards the enemy when he attacks if necessary to engage. Attacking can involve special maneuvers, cleaves, etc.

**Bash**: Bash down a stuck door, lift a portcullis, smash a window, etc. Depending on the action, this might require a Dungeonbashing proficiency throw.

**Defend:** Defend himself or an adjacent character to his rear or offhand flank. If the combatant does not have a shield, he or the target he defends gains a +2 AC against melee attacks. If the combatant has a shield, he or the target he defends gains a +4 AC against missile weapons other than thrown weapons, and a +2 AC against melee attacks and thrown missile attacks, and a +2 bonus on Blast saving throws.. The combatant must not have charged, run, or retreated. A character does not benefit from being defended by two characters from the same facing, but can benefit by being defended to both his front and flanks/rear. The benefits of the Defend action last until the start of the combatant’s next initiative or until the combatant declares he is casting a spell (whichever comes first).

**Escape:** Attempt to end the grabbed, restrained, or wrestled condition. See Escaping (p. XX).

**Hide:** Start hiding in cover or darkness. The combatant must be proficient in Hiding to take this action.

**Listen:** Listen for faint sounds.

**March:** Movein any desired direction (including to the flank or rear) at up to combat speed. The combatant can change facing as many times as desired while marching and end facing in any direction. The combatant must not be **engaged** at the start of the march.

**Ready a Combat or Movement Action:** Get ready to take an action at a later point. The combatant must state the intended action and trigger for taking it. A combatant who has a readied action loses his action if he takes damage, fails a saving throw, or is involuntarily moved before he uses his readied action.

**Rebuke:** Rebuke undead in line of sight.

**Stand Up:** Stand up if prone.

**Take Cover:** Take cover by falling prone, crouching, kneeling, etc.

**Treat Injury**: Treat the injury of an unconscious ally, triggering a roll on the Mortal Wounds table. The combatant can apply a healing herb on the ally, pour a potion down the ally’s throat, use a curative magic item on the ally, or use *lay on hands* on the ally as part of this action in order to grant the ally a bonus to the roll. (Casting a *cure* spell on an unconscious ally requires a full-round action, but also counts as treating the injury.)

**Use Spell-Like Ability:** Use a spell-like ability that is either innately possessed by the combatant or available from an equipped item.

###### Readied Actions

When a combatant readies a combat action, he gives up his ability to take an action on his initiative segment for a chance to do so later in the round. He can interrupt another combatant’s action any time before his next initiative segment to take his readied action. The interruption occurs after the interrupted combatant’s movement action but before the interrupted combatant’s combat action.

**Countercharge:** A readied attack may (but does not have to) be considered a countercharge if the opponent whose action it is interrupting took a charge movement action. If so, the combatant gains a +2 bonus on his attack throw and on subsequent cleaves provided he takes a 5’ step after each cleave, and deals impact damage if eligible to do so. However, the combatant’s AC is reduced by 2 until he takes his next initiative segment.

**Loss of Readied Action:** A combatant who takes damage, fails a saving throw, or is involuntarily moved loses his readied action.

**Readied vs. Readied:** If two combatants both have actions readied and both trigger at the same time, the combatant’s readied actions are resolved in order of their current initiative numbers.

**Staying Ready:** If at the end of a combat round, a character still has a readied action, he retains the readied action and can use it on the subsequent round. Once his initiative number comes up again, he stops being ready, but can still act normally. If he delays his initiative segment, he stops being ready.

**Reserve Standoff:** If an entire combat round passes with no offensive actions made by either side against their opponents, all combatants lose any readied actions. (This is why combatants can never begin combat readied.)

**Readied Attack Against Charge:** A combatant equipped with a polearm, spear or other weapon capable of dealing impact damage who makes a readied attack against a charging opponent deals impact damage. The combatant has “set for the charge” and uses the opponent’s momentum against him. The combatant does not get a +2 bonus to hit nor does he suffer a -2 penalty on his AC. (A combatant who wants the attack throw bonus should use his readied action to countercharge, see above).

### Conducting an Attack

By default, combatants receive one attack from any given combat action or charge action. Through magic such as *swift sword*,some combatants might gain an additional attack on their combat action. Some monsters have **attack sequences,** the most common of which is the claw/claw/bite sequence, which permits three attacks on one combat action. Combatants who kill or incapacitate an opponent with an attack can **cleave** to gain additional attacks (as described below). For combatants with multiple attacks, the cleaves from a successful attack are resolved before proceeding to the next attack in the attack sequence.

Whether or not an attack hits its target is determined with an **attack throw**.The player or Judge rolls 1d20 and applies any modifiers to the roll from high Strength or Dexterity, magic, or special circumstances. The result is compared to the target values listed on the Attack Throw table for the combatant’s class and level or HD. Because well-armored or highly dexterous targets are harder to hit than lightly-armored or sluggish ones, the target’s **Armor Class** is added to the target value necessary to hit it.

If the throw succeeds, the attack hits the target. When a hit is scored, the attacker rolls for damage by weapon type or monster attack, taking into account any bonuses or penalties. If the throw fails, the attack missed the target. (If it missed by less than the target’s AC from armor, the attack bounced off the armor.) As with all throws, an unmodified roll of 20 is always a hit, and an unmodified roll of 1 is always a miss.

EXAMPLE: Marcus is a 10th level fighter with an attack throw of 4+. To hit an unarmored target (AC 0), he only needs to roll a 4 or higher. To hit a plate-armored target (AC 6), he needs to roll a (4+6) = 10 or higher. If he rolled a 3 or less, his attack would be a clean miss. If he rolled a 4 – 9, his attack would still count as a miss, but in the game world he’d have clanged his blade on the plate.

EXAMPLE: A 20 HD bronze golem has an attack throw -10. It attacks an ogre (AC 3). To hit the ogre, it needs to roll a (-10 + 3) = -7 or higher. However, an modified roll of 1 is always a miss, so the golem will need to roll at least a 2 or more. The golem is so powerful that the ogre’s armor is irrelevant to it.

**Elevation and Flanking:** A combatant’s position relative to his target can affect his attack throw. If he is attacking a target at a lower elevation, the target is **subjacent**, granting him a +1 bonus to attack the target. If he is attacking the target from a space on either flank, the target is **flanked**, granting him a +2 bonus to attack the target. If he is attacking the target from its rear, the target is **vulnerable**, granting him a +2 bonus to attack it and to make an ambush or backstab if eligible. The bonus from attacking a subjacent character can stack with the bonus from attacking a flanked and/or vulnerable character, but the bonus from attacking a flanked and vulnerable character cannot stack.

| 20+ | - | - | - | -9+ |
| \*Non-proficient characters such as peasants and militia attack with a -1 penalty, giving them an effective 12+ attack throw. | | | | |

If a monster’s entry includes a hp bonus next to its HD value, round its HD up to the next highest value for purposes of calculating its attack throw value.

EXAMPLE: A hobgoblin has 1+1 HD. It attacks as a 2 HD monster, with a 9+ attack throw.

###### Melee Attacks

Melee attacks can be from swords, axes, spears, or other weapons or from natural weapons such as horns, tusks, and claws. In order to make a melee attack at a particular target, a combatant must be within 5’ of the target and facing him. However, combatants equipped with **long weapons** who are positioned behind and facing an ally can attack targets within 5’ of that ally. This represents the greater reach available to a second-rank combatant with a spear or polearm. Some monsters of great size or with special attacks can make melee attacks at 10’, 20’ or more. A combatant making a melee attack does not need to have line of sight on its target, but if it lacks line of sight it is considered **blind**.

Attack throws and damage rolls with melee attacks are modified by the attacker’s STR modifier and can also be modified by his and/or his target’s weapons, magic items, class powers, proficiencies, and/or conditions.

EXAMPLE: Norden is a 7th level dwarven vaultguard with 16 STR. He is equipped with a **+1 battle axe**and knows the Goblin-Slaying proficiency. He is attacking an orc chieftain with AC 6. Unfortunately, Norden is also **blinded** by evil magic. His attack throw value from his class level is 6+. He gets +2 from his Strength, +2 from Goblin Slaying, +1 for his magic axe, and -4 from being blinded. Therefore he hits on 5+, or 11+ after factoring in the chieftain’s armor class of 6.

**Fighting Style:** A combatant’s **fighting style** can sometimes affect his melee attack throw. Combatants fighting in the dual weapon style gain a +1 bonus to the melee attack throw from having the second weapon. If the combatant has Fighting Style Specialization (dual weapon), he gains an additional +1 bonus, for a total of +2. If a dual-wielding combatant’s off-hand weapon is magical, its magical bonus is also added to the attack throw (stacking with another weapon the way a shield stacks with armor), but not to the damage roll. However, the dual weapon style does notgive additional attacks.

**Special Maneuvers:** Instead of making a standard melee attack, combatants can attempt to disarm, knock down, wrestle, or otherwise disrupt their opponent in some way. See **Special Maneuvers**, below.

Missile attacks can be from bows, slings, crossbows, and even thrown items like bottles of holy water or oil flasks. In order to make a missile attack at a particular target, the target must be in **range**. The Missile Weapon Ranges table shows the short, medium, and long range of various missile weapons. Missile attack throws against targets at short range are not penalized. Missile attack throws against targets at medium range have a -2 penalty. Missile attack throws against targets at long range have a -5 penalty. If an opponent is further away than the long range listed, the missile weapon cannot target that opponent at all (unless he is part of a large formation, see below).

In most cases, the target must also be in **line of sight**. Line of sight can be blocked by corners, hills, walls, or other obstacles that completely block the view. Line of sight is not blocked by intervening combatants, nor by arrow loops, battlements, or other types of **cover**. However, cover can make it harder to hit.

Missile attacks at targets in cover suffer a -2 penalty if the cover is waist-high (like a hedge) and -4 if the cover is chest high (like a battlement) or very narrow (like an arrow loop).

Missile attacks through intervening **engaged** allies to strike at unengaged enemy targets suffer a -4 penalty. Missile attacks at enemy targets engaged with allied targets are not permitted at all due to the risk of friendly fire, unless the attacker has Precise Shooting proficiency. Attackers with Precise Shooting can shoot engaged targets at a -4 penalty, and unengaged targets through a melee at no penalty. They also ignore up to 4 points of cover. Missile attacks are never allowed against an enemy engaging the firer.

In addition to range and cover, attack throws with missile weapons might be modified by the attacker’s DEX modifier and by his and/or his target’s weapons, ammunition magic items, class powers, proficiencies, and/or conditions. A combatant who uses a magic missile weapon or magic ammunition adds the bonus to both the attack throw and damage. A combatant who fires magic ammunition from a magic weapon adds the higher bonus to his attack throw and adds both bonuses to his damage roll.

###### Missile Attacks vs. Troop Formations

When fighting on the battlefield, troops march in large formations. Man-sized infantry formations typically consist of 30 troops (platoons), 120 troops (company), 480 troops (battalion), or 1920 troops (brigade) occupying a frontage of 15’, 60’, 240’, and 960’ respectively. Because of these formations are so large, it much easier to target a formation rather than an individual troop within the formation.

* A platoon can be targeted at long range as if it were at medium range.
* A company can be targeted out to long range with no penalty.
* A battalion can be targeted out to double long range with no penalty.
* A brigade can be targeted out to quadruple long range with no penalty.

When making an attack against a formation, the actual target struck by the attack is determined randomly by the Judge. If there are allies engaged with the unit, the allies count as possible targets. The attacker cannot choose a target.

EXAMPLE: Athelstan is equipped with a long bow. A long bow has a medium range of 220’ and a long range of 360’. Athelstan can fire at a platoon 360’ away with a -2 penalty. He can fire at a company 360’ away with no penalty. He can fire at a battalion 720’ away at no penalty. He can fire at a brigade 1420’ away at no penalty. 1420’ is 475 yards. Historians typically set the absolute maximum range of the long bow at 450 to 500 yards. However, an English longbowmen could not hope to hit a man-sized target at 475 yards, and neither can Athelstan.

###### Missile Attacks with Burning Oil, Holy Water, and Torches

**Oil flasks** can be lit and then thrown as missile attacks. A missile attack with an oil flask is always targeted at an **impact point**. The impact point can be a particular creature, structure, vessel, terrain feature, or simply a point on a ceiling, floor, wall, or obstacle. The attacker must have a line of sight to the desired impact point. If the attacker’s line of sight to its impact point is blocked, then the oil flask’s impact point becomes the point at which its line of sight is blocked. Once the impact point is designated, the combatant hurling the oil flask makes an attack throw. If the impact point is in or behind cover, or at a different elevation from the attacker, apply those modifiers to throw. If the impact point is a creature, structure, or vessel, apply its AC. The result is determined by the attack throw:

* A direct hit occurs if the attacker’s modified attack throw is sufficient to hit the impact point. If the impact point is on a wooden structure or vessel, the oil deals 1 structural fire damage. If the impact point is a creature, then the oil deals 1d8 fire damage to the creature immediately, and another 1d8 fire damage on the same initiative count next round. A direct hit on the impact point also can deal splash damage to all targets within 5’ of it (see below).
* A splash occurs if the attacker’s modified attack throw is sufficient to hit the impact point, ignoring the target’s Armor Class. The combatant at the impact point (if any), and each combatant within 5’ of the impact point, must make a Blast saving throw. If the save fails, the combatant suffers 1d3 fire damage, and on a success avoid being splashed.
* A fumble occurs if the attacker’s attack throw is an unmodified 1. A fumble with oil results in the attacker setting himself on fire. He suffers damage as if directly hit. A fumble does not cause splash damage.
* A miss occurs on any other result. Roll 1d12 to determine the scatter (misdirection) of the throw, applied as a clock direction from the target. If thrown at short range, the oil flask lands 1d10’ away in the indicated direction. If thrown at medium range, it lands 2d10’ away. If thrown at long range, it lands 5d10’ away. Combatants within 5’ of the oil flask when it lands must make successful Blast saving throws or suffer splash damage, as above.

Unlike ordinary missile attacks, missile attacks with burning oil can target **engaged** opponents, albeit at grave risk of splash damage and scatter. The attack throw suffers a -4 penalty, or no penalty if the attacker has Precise Shooting proficiency.

Characters can also throw oil flasks unlit to avoid the risk of setting themselves on fire. Unlit oil does no damage, but can be lit with a torch later (either through melee or missile attacks). A character splashed with unlit oil takes 1d3 fire damage when it is lit. A character directly hit by unlit oil takes 1d8 fire damage when it is lit and another 1d8 fire damage on the same initiative count the following round.

An oil flask can also be poured on the ground and lit. Oil that is poured on the ground can cover a diameter of 5’ and burns for a full turn. It inflicts 1d8 fire damage to any creature that starts its initiative in or enters the burning patch.

**Vials of holy water** can also be thrown like flasks of burning oil. Holy water deals extraordinary luminous damage to chaotic enchanted creatures following the same rules as burning oil, but is harmless to other creatures. (Unholy water deals extraordinary necrotic damage to lawful enchanted creatures.) Holy water must be kept in its designated containers or it loses its sacred properties.

While not area of effect weapons, **torches** can also be thrown at creatures, structures, vessels, terrain features, or points. On a direct hit, a thrown torch deals 1d4 fire damage to its target. On a splash, it deals 1 fire damage to its target, then falls to the ground. On a miss, it scatters and does not deal damage. The torch remains lit. However, on a fumble, it scatters and is extinguished. Throwing torches is not a very effective combat tactic, but can be very useful for adventurers who want to illuminate an area up ahead without advancing into it.

Missile attacks with burning oil, holy water, or torches do not gain a bonus to damage from high STR or from class.

###### Missile Attacks with Artillery

A missile attack with artillery is always targeted at an **impact point**. The impact point can be a particular creature, structure, vessel, terrain feature, or simply a point in space. The artillery must have a line of sight to the desired impact point. If the artillery’s line of sight to its impact point is blocked, then the artillery’s impact point becomes the point at which its line of sight is blocked

Once the impact point is designated, the artillery crew makes an attack throw. If the impact point is a creature, structure, or vessel, apply its AC. The result is determined by the attack throw:

* A direct hit occurs if the attacker’s modified attack throw is sufficient to hit the target. If the impact point is on a structure or vessel, the artillery deals damage to the structural hit points (shp) of the target. If the impact point is a creature, terrain feature, or point in space, then the artillery deals damage to the creature and any other creatures in its area of effect. Creatures in the area of effect (excluding the creature at the impact point, if any) can reduce damage by half with a successful Blast saving throw.
* A splash occurs if the attacker’s modified attack throw is sufficient to hit the target, ignoring the target’s Armor Class. The artillery deals damage to any creatures in its area of effect. Creatures in the area of effect (including a creature at the impact point) can avoid all damage with a successful Blast saving throw. Splashes do not usually deal damage to structures.
* A fumble occurs if the character’s attack throw is an unmodified 1. A fumble with combustible pitch results in the artillery being set on fire, as if directly hit. A fumble with a repeating ballista indicates a malfunction requiring 1 turn for a siege engineer to repair. During this time the ballista cannot be fired. A fumble with any other weapon and ammunition results in a scatter of 6d6 feet per 250’ of range (see below).
* A scatter occurs on any other result. Roll 1d12 to determine the direction to a new impact point, applied as a clock direction from the original impact point (such that 6’o’clock points towards the firing artillery). The new impact point is 3d6 feet away per 250’ of range. Resolve the effects of the artillery as if a splash had occurred at the new impact point

The following other rules apply.

**Accuracy:** Counterweight trebuchets gain a +2 bonus on attack throws. Catapults and trebuchets (but not ballistas) have difficulty striking small, fast-moving creatures. They suffer a -4 penalty to attack throws against man-sized creatures and a -2 penalty to attack throws against large (ogre-sized) creatures. They suffer an additional -1 penalty to attack throws per 10’ of movement the creature moved. The size penalty does not apply to formations of troops, but the movement penalty does.

**Crew:** The number of crew and type of artillery determines rate of fire. Making a missile attack with artillery is a full-round action for the entire crew. The crew act on the same initiative, rolled with the worst initiative modifier of any crew member. Artillery crews attack as the lowest level member of the crew. Artillery crews without an artillerist reduce their rate of fire by half and suffer -4 to attack throws. In between shots, the artillery is reloaded, the firing arm is cranked back into position, the frame is adjusted to aim at a new target, etc.

**Range:** Artillery cannot be used to attack targets closer than the minimum range or farther than the maximum range indicated. Artillery do not have any range penalties within their effective range. However, artillery firing crude ammunition suffer a -2 to attack throws at all ranges.

**Damaging Stone Structures:** Light and medium ballista cannot damage stone structures, even with a direct hit. All other artillery deal 1/10 damage to stone structures on a direct hit.

**Damaging Wood Structures:** On a direct hit, light and medium ballista deal 1/10 damage to wooden structures; heavy ballista and light catapults deal 1/3 damage to wooden structure; and other artillery deal full damage to wooden structures.

**Damaging Wood Structures with Burning Pitch:** Some artillery can fire burning pitch. A wooden structure that is directly hit or splashed by burning pitch immediately takes structural fire damage and is set aflame. A character in the pitch’s area of effect must make a Blast saving throw. If the save fails, the character takes 4d6 fire damage. If the save succeeds, the character suffers half that damage.

Each round thereafter, on the same initiative count, the pitch continues to deal 4d6 structural fire damage to the wooden structure and 4d6 fire damage to characters in the area of effect (half that on a successful save). A character in or within 5’ of the area of effect can fight the fire as a full-round action. When a total of 15 full-round actions have been spent fighting the fire (e.g. 5 characters spending 3 full-round actions each), the fire is extinguished.

### Dealing Damage

When combatants successfully attack, they deal damage. Damage dealt is based on the type of weapon as well as the fighting style with which the combatant is wielding it:

* Whips deal 1d2 damage.
* Unarmed strikes deal 1d3 nonlethal damage.
* Tiny melee weapons, such as daggers, hatchets, clubs, and bludgeons all deal 1d4 damage. A staff deals 1d4 damage when wielded one-handed, and 1d6 damage when wielded two-handed.
* Small melee weapons designed exclusively for one-handed use, such as hand axes, javelins, and short swords, deal 1d6 points of damage.
* Medium melee weapons designed for both one- or two-handed use, such as flails, battle axes, maces, morning stars, picks, spears, swords, and warhammers, deal 1d6 damage when wielded one-handed, or 1d8 damage when wielded two-handed.
* Large melee weapons designed exclusively for two-handed use, such as polearms and two-handed swords, deal 1d10 damage.
* Thrown daggers, darts, and sling stones deal 1d4 damage. Arrows, crossbow bolts, and staff-slung stones bolts deal 1d6 damage. Arbalest bolts deal 1d8 damage.
* Combatants dual wielding two weapons do 1d6 damage if the weapon in their main hand is medium or small, and 1d4 damage if the weapon is tiny. The size of the weapon in their off-hand does not affect damage.
* Natural weapons used by monsters deal the damage listed in the monster’s entry.

The damage from an attack can be modified by the attacker’s Strength and by the attacker and/or the target’s magic bonuses, class powers, proficiencies, or conditions. Damage modifiers cannot reduce damage from a successful attack to 0 except by magic — at least 1 hp of damage will be dealt otherwise.

Some weapons deal **impact damage** when used in a charge, countercharge, or readied attack against a charging opponent. Impact damage is usually one extra die of damage by the weapon, though some monsters deal even more impact damage than that. Any impact damage dealt is of the same damage type as the weapon used.

###### Damage Type

Every spell, effect, or weapon that deals damage has one or more **damage types**. Damage types are important because some combatants are resistant or immune to them. There are 12 damage types in ***ACKS II****,* split into **physical** and **energy** damage. The physical damage types are acidic, arcane, bludgeoning, piercing, poisonous, and slashing. The energy damage types are cold, electric, fire, luminous, necrotic, seismic. If not otherwise tagged, damage is considered **mundane**, but some damage is tagged **extraordinary**.

* Acidic: Damage dealt by caustic and corrosive agents. Acidic damage can be dealt by natural acids and certain spells.
* Arcane: Damage dealt by magical physical force. Arcane damage can only be dealt by magic.
* Bludgeoning: Damage dealt by blunt force. Bludgeoning damage can be dealt by clubs, maces, and so on, or by spells.
* Cold: Damage dealt by exposure to extreme cold. Cold damage can be dealt by natural cold or by water elemental magic.
* Electric: Damage dealt by electricity. Electric damage can be dealt by natural lightning or by air elemental magic.
* Fire: Damage dealt by flame and heat. Fire damage can be dealt by natural heat and flame or by fire elemental magic.
* Luminous: Damage dealt by generative forces of creation and light. Luminous damage is only dealt by magic, usually divine.
* Necrotic: Damage dealt by entropic forces of destruction and darkness. Necrotic damage is usually dealt by death magic.
* Piercing: Damage dealt by penetration. Piercing damage is dealt by arrows, spears, and similar weapons and by some spells.
* Poisonous: Damage dealt by toxins. Poisonous damage can be dealt by natural venoms and by some spells.
* Seismic: Damage dealt by tectonic forces. Seismic damage can be dealt by natural earthquakes or by earth elemental magic.
* Slashing: Damage dealt by laceration. Slashing damage can be dealt by axes, swords, and similar weapons and by some spells.

If an attack can deal two or more types of damage, the target must be resistant or invulnerable to both or all of the types dealt to reduce or avoid the damage.

###### Damage Type Immunity and Resistance

Some combatants are immune or resistant to particular damage types. When a combatant is **immune** to a damage type, it automatically succeeds on all saving throws against spells or special abilities that deal that damage type, and ignores damage of that type. A combatant might be immune to both mundane and extraordinary damage of a type, or to just one or the other. When a combatant is **resistant** to a damage type, it suffers only half damage from that type. It also gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against spells or special abilities that deal that damage type.

Some monsters have particular flaws in their immunity or resistance. One common flaw is that the monster treats weapons made of silver as if they were magic for purposes of its resistance.

Since most monsters use natural attacks like bites and claws, this raises the question of whether monsters deal mundane or extraordinary damage. The ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual***specifies the exact damage type for each monster attack. In general, the following rules apply:

* If a monster is a humanoid, its natural attacks always deal mundane damage.
* If a monster is an animal with more than 4+1 HD and of huge size or larger, its natural attacks deal extraordinary damage; otherwise they deal mundane damage.
* If a monster is a construct, giant, monstrosity, undead, or vermin with more than 4+1 HD, its natural attacks deal extraordinary damage; otherwise they deal mundane damage.
* If a monster is an incarnation, its natural attacks always deal extraordinary damage.

###### Effects of Damage

All damage dealt is subtracted from a combatant’s hit points. When a combatant’s hit points drop to 0 or fewer, the combatant is usually **unconscious** and possiblydead. (A few types of combatants are immediately destroyed or slain, explained below.) The combatant’s condition remains uncertain until an ally either casts a *cure* spell on it or otherwise treats its wounds, or until necromantic magic is used on it. When this occurs, the unconscious combatant must roll 1d20 and 1d6 on the **Mortal Wounds** table for the type of damage that felled it. (For piercing or slashing damage dealt by natural weapons, use the **Permanent Wounds – Savage** table.) Combatants not treated within 24 hours of being unconscious mustroll, with no bonus for treatment and at the full -10 penalty for being treated 1 day later.

Apply the modifiers listed below to the d20 roll. The modified 1d20 roll determines the unconscious combatant’s condition while the unmodified 1d6 roll determines the **permanent wound** the creature suffers, if any.

* *Combatant’s Constitution:* ± CON modifier of unconscious combatant
* *Combatant’s Equipment:* +2 if wearing heavy helm
* *Combatant’s Hit Die Value:* +2 if d6 HD; +4 if d8 HD; +6 if d10 HD; +8 if d12 HD
* *Combatant’s Hit Points:* +5 if hp are exactly 0; -2 if hp are at negative value from ¼ to ½ max hp; -5 if hp are at negative value from -½ to max hp; -10 if hp are at negative value from max to 2x max hp; -20 if hp are at negative value greater than 2x max hp
* *Ally’s Healing Magic:* +1 per level of healing magic applied to unconscious creature; +1/2 class level if laying on hands
* *Ally’s Healing Proficiency:* +1 per rank of Healing proficiency
* *Ally’s Healing Herbs:* +2 if Horsetail applied
* *Necromantic Magic:* -1/2 spell level if roll triggered by necromantic magic
* *Treatment Timing:* +2 if treated within 1 round of injury; -3 if treated within 1 turn of injury; -5 if treated within 1 hour of injury; -8 if treated within 1 day of injury; -10 if treated more than 1 day after injury

Magic used to gain a bonus to the Mortal Wounds roll does not heal damage. If the Mortal Wounds roll was at least a 16, the combatant will awaken with 1 hp. If the Mortal Wounds roll was 15 or less, the combatant remains at its current hp (i.e. 0 or fewer) and begins dying. If the combatant is not then subsequently healed by the end of the listed time period for its condition, it is slain.

Constructs, incarnations, and undead that are reduced to 0 hp are immediately destroyed. Plants and oozes reduced to 0 hp are immediately slain. They cannot have their wounds treated nor benefit from healing magic.

EXAMPLE: Marcus, a fighter with 36 hit points and 18 CON, is reduced to -12 hit points by a *fireball*. His ally Balbus casts *cure serious injury* on him the next round. Marcus now rolls on the Mortal Wounds - Fire table. His d20 roll is modified by -2 (because his hp are at a negative value greater than ¼ his maximum hit points) +4 (from his d8 HD) +4 (from *cure serious injury*) +2 (treated within one round of injury) and +3 (modifier for 18 CON) for a total adjustment of +11. Unfortunately he rolls a 6, modified to 17, indicating that he is in shock. He is at 1 hp and needs magical healing and a night’s bed rest to recover. His d6 roll is a 2, so his ear is burned off. He suffers a permanent -1 penalty to surprise rolls and Listening throws. Note that Marcus did not regain any hp from *cure serious injury*.

What if Balbus had kept his *cure serious injury* to use after the roll? In that case, Marcus would have only had a +7 modifier, so his roll would have only been a 13. In this case, he would have been critically wounded with -12 hp. Marcus’s allies would have had just one day to get him to 1 hp before he died. In addition, his permanent wound would have been much worse — instead of a lost ear, he’d have had his manhood burned off! (A sadly common plight for adventurers, we are told.) It’s almost always better to use the healing spell on a Mortal Wounds roll when available.

If a combatant suffers a permanent wound, the effects are permanent until the wound is healed. *Repair disfigurement & disability*, *restore life and limb*, *trollblood*, and similar magic can heal one or more permanent wounds. If a combatant is killed, he can be revived with *restore life and limb* or other magical effect that restores the dead to life.

However, combatants treated with such magic often need extensive periods of time to recover, and might suffer strange side effects. The character rolls 1d20 and 1d6 on the **Tampering with Mortality** table for his alignment and applies the modifiers listed below. The resulting side effects are permanent and can only be removed with a *miracle* or *wish*.

* *Span of Combatant’s Life:* +2 if creature is youthful; 0 if creature is adult; -5 if creature is middle aged; -10 if creature is old; -20 if creature is ancient
* *Spellcaster’s Power:* +½ level of spellcaster casting spell; +2 if cast in temple of spellcaster’s god
* *State of the Combatant’s Body:* -10 if creature instantly killed; -5 per spine severing; -2 per limb destroyed; -1 per each hand/foot/ear/eye/tongue/genitalia destroyed
* *State of the Combatant’s Soul:* ±WIL modifier of creature; -1 for each full day creature has been dead; -1 for each side effect already suffered

When applying penalties due to the state of the combatant’s body, a combatant is considered to be instantly killed if it died from disease or poison, was slain while helpless, or rolled an “instantly killed” result on the Mortal Wounds table. The maximum penalty for state of the combatant’s body is -10.

The Mortal Wounds and Tampering with Mortality tables can be found in **Appendix C: Wounds and Woe** (p. XX). The permanent wounds and side effects are described in the tables.

###### Healing

Virtually all creatures recover hit points through rest. For each full day dedicated to rest in reasonably sanitary conditions, a combatant will recover 1d3 hp. Characters with the Healing proficiency can improve a creature’s natural healing (p. XX).

Interruptions during rest of more than 1 turn in duration prevents a creature from recovering any health that day. However, the healing process can be hastened through the use of magic, such as potions or spells, which can provide instantaneous or expedited recovery. It is possible to combine magical healing with natural healing to enhance the healing process.

Some results on the Mortal Wounds or Tampering with Mortality tables will indicate that a creature needs a period of bed rest to recover. During this time, the creature is **incapacitated**. It cannot be healed above 1 hit point by natural or magical healing, and cannot attack, cast spells, or undertake dedicated activities of any sort. If an incapacitated creature is reduced to 0 hp again before it has had sufficient rest, it is instantly slain. If the table indicates that the period of bed rest can be shortened with magical healing, then any form of healing magic, including **cure**spells, potions, Laying On Hands, or other means, will suffice. Otherwise, the period of bed rest cannot be shortened. An incapacitated creature under the care of a character with Healing proficiency can take bed rest when traveling as a passenger in a vehicle.

###### Nonlethal Damage

Some attacks may inflict **nonlethal damage**. Nonlethal damage is subtracted from a creature’s hit points like normal damage. A creature reduced to 0 hp or less by nonlethal damage, or any combination of normal or nonlethal damage, is still unconsciousand possiblydead. However, the likelihood of death and the rate of healing are different for nonlethal damage, so a running total of the amount of nonlethal damage should still be recorded.

EXAMPLE: Marcus is fighting an ogre with 26 hit points. In the first round of combat, Marcus stabs the ogre for 8 piercing damage, reducing it to 18 current hit points. In the second round of combat, Marcus starts attacking with the flat of his blade (a **special maneuver**, described later,that incurs a -4 penalty to his attack throw) to attempt to knock out the ogre. He inflicts 6 nonlethal bludgeoning damage in the second round and 9 points of nonlethal damage in the third round. At this point the ogre has 3 current hit points and has taken 15 nonlethal damage. In the fourth round, Marcus makes a normal attack that deals 7 slashing damage. This reduces the ogre to -4 hit points. Because it has now taken a combination of normal and nonlethal damage reducing its hit points to 0 or fewer, the ogre is knocked out and possibly dead.

Creatures reduced to 0 hp or less by nonlethal damage are far less likely to have sustained mortal wounds. When the creature rolls on the **Mortal Wounds** table, modify the die roll by +1 per point of nonlethal damage dealt before the creature was knocked unconscious. (Pummeling your allies after they are incapacitated does not help them recover).

EXAMPLE: Immediately after the fight, Marcus rouses the ogre to interrogate it. The Judge rolls 1d20+1d6 for the ogre and gets a 9 and a 3. Marcus did not use any healing magic or have Healing proficiency, so the 1d20 roll is modified by +15 (because ogre took 15 nonlethal damage) and -2 (because it was treated after the fight), for a +13 modifier, yielding a total of 22. Cross-referencing 22 and 3 on the Mortal Wounds table, the Judge determines that the ogre awakens concussed, with 1 hp, having lost 1d6 teeth. It will require 1 day of bed rest or magical healing.

Once a creature has resolved its condition on the Mortal Wounds table, all nonlethal damage is removed. Otherwise, nonlethal damage recovers at a rate of 1 hit point per hour. Spells or magical powers that cure hit point damage remove an equal amount of nonlethal damage in addition to their normal healing.

### Cleaving

In the legends and sagas, heroes can chop through weak foes quickly, often slaying two with one blow. Skilled archers might fire as quickly as one arrow every few seconds, fire two arrows at once, or pierce multiple foes with one arrow. The Cleaving rules simulate these feats of glorious mayhem.

Whenever a combatant kills or incapacitates an opponent with a melee or missile attack, he can immediately make another attack throw against another opponent in melee or missile range. The additional attack throw must be with the same weapon as the attack that killed the previous opponent. A combatant with multiple attacks must attack again with whichever attack incapacitated or killed the target. A combatant with multiple attacks must complete all cleaves triggered by its present attack before making the next attack in its routine.

A combatant who cleaves after an ambush or backstab continues to receive a +4 bonus on his attack throw and to deal extra damage provided that each subsequent target was eligible to be ambushed or backstabbed by the combatant at the start of his attack routine. As soon as the combatant attacks a target who doesn’t qualify, the ambush or backstab bonus is lost, though the combatant can keep cleaving if eligible.

Monsters, fighters, and other characters that use the fighter attack throw progression can make a maximum number of cleave attacks per round equal to their Hit Dice. Clerics, thieves, and other characters that use the cleric/thief attack throw progression can make a maximum number of cleave attacks per round equal to half their Hit Dice (rounded down). Mages and characters that use the mage attack throw progression cannot make cleave attacks.

###### Cleaving in Melee

When cleaving after a melee attack, a combatant who incapacitates or kills a target can take a 5’ step toward another target in line of sight prior to making the cleave attack. The combatant can take a 5’ step even if **engaged** by another target or targets, but must remain engaged by them at the end of its 5’ step unless it is moving after a successful overrun against them.

A combatant who cleaves after a charge or countercharge continues to receive a +2 bonus on its attack throw and to deal impact damage (if its weapon deals impact damage on a charge or countercharge) provided it takes a 5’ step after each cleave. As soon as the combatant cleaves without moving, the charge bonus is lost, though the combatant can keep cleaving if eligible

A combatant who cleaves after a readied attack with an impact weapon on a charging target continues to deal impact damage provided that each subsequent targets also charged. As soon as the combatant attacks a target who doesn’t qualify, the extra damage is lost, though the combatant can keep cleaving if eligible.

If, after completing a melee attack that killed or incapacitated a target, the combatant has no targets remaining within 5’ that he can engage, and has cleaves remaining, he can expend a cleave to hurl a thrown weapon. If he hurls a weapon and incapacitates or kills the target, he can cleave with other thrown weapons if available. Alternatively, he can expend a cleave to revert to the Defend action or to Ready a Combat Action. If he had Charged, reverting to Defend simply removes the -2 penalty from Charging, so that this penalty need not be tracked. (In the game world, the character, having destroyed all foes nearby, assumes a protective stance. This is seen in historical source material such as ***Conan the Barbarian***, where Valeria assumes a defensive stance after slaying all of Doom’s minions during the escape from the Mountain of Doom, as well as in most Akira Kurosawa samurai movies.)

A large magic melee weapon that deals bludgeoning or slashing damage adds its magic bonus to the maximum number of cleaves you can take with it, including for purposes of sweep attacks.

###### Cleaving with Missile Weapons

When cleaving after a missile attack, the attacker can move 5’ after each attack away from visible enemies. When making cleave attacks with missile weapons, combatants are limited to a maximum of 2 with arbalest or crossbow, and 3 + STR bonus with long bow and composite bow. They can take any number of cleaves using short bows, slings, sling-staffs, or thrown bola, darts, daggers, hand axes, javelins, spears, or warhammers, subject to their class, level, and available ammunition. Each target must be in the same range category as the original target, but the targets do not need to be within 5’ of each other.

If, after completing a missile attack that killed or incapacitated a target, the combatant has no targets in range that are unengaged by allies, and has cleaves remaining, he can expend a cleave to Ready, or to drop prone, hide, or move 5’ into cover. (In the game world, the character, having killed all threatening targets, seizes the opportunity to duck back into cover. This is seen in all historical source material. Missile firers who fail to kill all targets are assumed to still be in the process of engaging targets, caught off guard by the number of foes, or otherwise delay for that split second that lets them get blasted.)

### Saving Throws

Combatants are sometimes allowed or required to make **saving throws** to avoid the full effects of spells or certain attacks. There are five categories of saving throws. The appropriate saving throw to use and the effects of a success or failure will be indicated in the description of the spell, monster attack, or dungeon scenario. When there is a doubt as to which category to use, start at the left column and move to the right, and use the first which matches the particular effect.

* **Paralysis** covers those effects in which the victim will be rendered immobile or put in flight, such as being paralyzed by a ghoul, turned to stone, put to sleep, or subjected to a **fear** or **halt** spell.
* **Death** includes those effects where hit points are rendered irrelevant and the result is instant death, dismemberment, disease, disintegration, blindness, or other deadly effect.
* **Blast** is used for damaging effects targeting an area, such as a ball of fire, a lightning bolt, a dragon’s breath weapon, a collapsing ceiling, an avalanche, and so on, excluding effects covered by one of the earlier categories.
* **Implements** is used for any magical effects from items such as rings, rods, staffs, and wands not covered by one of the earlier categories.
* **Spells** covers any magical effect from a cast spell not covered by one of the earlier categories.

Characters and monsters have a target value for each saving throw category determined by their class, race, and level and/or HD. Like all throws, saving throws are made by rolling 1d20, applying any relevant modifiers (such as the character’s WIL modifier), and comparing the modified die roll to the throw’s target value.

A result that is greater than or equal to the target value is a success. A result that is less than the target value is a failure. As with all throws, an unmodified roll of 20 is always a success, and an unmodified roll of 1 is always a failure.

A successful saving throw rolls can sometimes completely negate an effect, but other times it will merely reduce the severity of the effect. An attack like a venomous bite can cause harm in two ways: through the physical bite and through the poison that may be injected into the wound. The damage is applied as hit points, while the result of the poison is resolved with a saving throw.

###### Saving Throw Adjustments from Cover

Combatants in cover gain bonus to Blast saving throws caused by artillery, burning oil, or similar effects. if the cover is waist-high (like a hedge), the bonus is +2. If the cover is chest-high (like a battlement) or very narrow (like an arrow loop), the bonus is +4. In addition, on a successful saving throw, creatures protected by arrow slits take nodamage, even if the effect would normally deal ½ damage.

###### Size-Adjusted Saving Throws

Sometimes a saving throw will be designed as **size-adjusted**, e.g. “the combatant must make a size-adjusted Paralysis saving throw.” A combatant making a size-adjusted saving throw suffers a -2 penalty to its saving throw per size category smaller than the creature which triggered the saving throw, but gains a +2 bonus to its saving throw per size category larger than the creature which triggered the throw.

EXAMPLE: A stone giant has made a successful throw to force back a human fighter. The fighter is required to make a size-adjusted Paralysis saving throw. The stone giant is huge, while the human is man-sized – two size categories smaller. Therefore the fighter saves at -4. If the fighter were forcing back the giant, the giant would save at +4.

###### Saving Throw Tables

For convenience, we have re-printed the saving throw tables for each class. Note that the fighter progression has been broadened to include 0th level NPCs as well as high HD monsters.

### Casting Spells and Using Magic

In order to cast a spell, a spellcaster must inform the Judge that a spell is being cast, and which spell will be cast, before the initiative dice are rolled. If the caster takes damage or fails a saving throw before he acts, the spell is interrupted and lost. (The spell still counts against the character’s spells per day as if it had been cast.) A caster cannot move or perform any other action on the round he attempts to cast a spell.

A spellcaster must have a line of sight on the targets or area the spell is cast on. Some spells also require that the caster be **beholding** the target or that the target be **beholding** the caster or the effect. A creature is beholding an ally, enemy, or effect when that ally, enemy, or effect is in line of sight and within 10% of maximum visibility distance (typically 60’ for man-sized creatures).

Some spells impose other, unique conditions. Unlike melee and missile attacks, most spell attacks will automatically hit their chosen targets if they are within the spells’ range and area of effect. Certain spells permit or mandate a saving throw for the target(s) by which they can reduce or even nullify the spell’s effects. See the discussion on **Spells** in Chapter 5 and **saving throws** later in this chapter.

Some spells require that a caster maintain **concentration**. More powerful spells can require the caster maintain stationary concentration. See Conditions (p. XX) for rules on concentration and stationary concentration.

Some combatants can use magic without casting spells, either via spell-like abilities or via magic items. Spell-like abilities function like spell except that they only require a combat action to use and cannot be interrupted. Most magic items grant the user spell-like abilities, but scrolls are cast as spells.

### Special Maneuvers

Not every action in combat will be a sword swing, arrow shot, or fireball. The rules below explain how to handle everything from a punch with a plate mail gauntlet to a giant tossing a dwarf. Combatants cannot cleave after special maneuvers unless the maneuver itself incapacitates the target or states that it permits cleaves. Except where otherwise noted, combatants with multiple attacks (such as claw/claw/bite or multiple tentacles) can use any or all attacks from their attack routine to perform special maneuvers.

EXAMPLE: A giant octopus with eight tentacles might force back an opponent with one tentacle, wrestle an opponent with another tentacle, and attack normally with the remaining 6 tentacles.

###### Brawling

Sometimes a combatant will attack without a weapon, striking with a fist or foot. This is called brawling. Normal characters do 1d3 points of nonlethal damage with a punch, or 1d4 with a kick; kicks are rolled at a -2 penalty on the attack throw. Standard Strength adjustments apply. (See the **Nonlethal Damage** section, above, for details on nonlethal damage.) All character classes can engage in brawling; there is no “weapon” restriction in this case.

However, a character in light, very light, or no armor cannot successfully punch or kick a character in medium or heavy armor – if this is attempted, the damage is applied to the attacker instead of the defender. The Judge must decide which monsters can be successfully brawled based on their AC and physical make-up. Monsters do not themselves brawl, as they have natural attacks that are as good as weapons.

###### Clamber

A combatant can attempt to clamber on top of a creature that is one or more size categories larger than him. To clamber onto a creature, a combatant must succeed on a melee attack throw with a -4 penalty. If the combatant is proficient in Climbing, the -4 penalty is waived if the character makes a successful proficiency throw.

If the combatant’s attempt succeeds, the creature must then make a size-adjusted Paralysis saving throw. However the size adjustment is reversed, so the creature suffers a -2 penalty to its saving throw per size category *larger* than the combatant. If the creature succeeds on its saving throw, it has shrugged off the combatant’s attempt. If it fails, the combatant is now **clambering** on the creature. The combatant might be mounted on its back, perched on its shoulders, etc.

A **clambering** combatant gains a +2 attack bonus against the creature he has clambered onto. In addition, the creature that has been clambered onto is **vulnerable** to the clambering combatant. A clambering combatant also gains a measure of protection against the creature’s own attacks. If the creature lacks arms, tails, or other appendages capable of reaching its own back, it cannot directly attack the clambering combatant. Even if the creature does have such appendages, it attacks the clambering combatant with a -4 penalty to attack throws.

As an action in lieu of attacking, a creature with one or more combatants clambering on it can attempt to unseat the clambering combatants by bucking, rearing, colliding with walls, and similar tactics. This forces every combatant clambering on the creature to make a Paralysis saving throw. Combatants who succeed on the saving throw continue clambering. Combatants who fail the saving throw slip off the creature. If the creature is more than 10’ tall at the shoulder, or is flying, the unseated combatants will suffer 1d6 bludgeoning damage per 10’ fallen.

###### Coup de Grace

A combatant can coup de grace a helpless opponent of the same or smaller size category. Provided the combatant is not **engaged**, and his attack is capable of damaging the helpless creature, then the helpless creature can be automatically slain without needing to roll to hit or damage it. The combatant cannot cleave after coup de gracing a helpless creature. Unlike an ordinary attack, a coup de grace does not end the sneaking condition.

###### Disarm

A combatant can attempt to disarm his opponent of a weapon in his hand. To disarm an opponent, the combatant must make a melee attack throw with a -4 penalty. If the attack succeeds, the opponent suffers damage and then must make a Paralysis saving throw. The opponent gains a +4 bonus if he is wielding his weapon two-handed. If the opponent’s save succeeds, he maintains his grip on the weapon or item. If the opponent’s save fails, the weapon or item is knocked 5’ away.

###### Force Back

A combatant can attempt to force an opponent back, pushing him into an obstacle, through a doorway, or off a cliff. To force back an opponent, the combatant must make a melee attack throw with a -4 penalty. If the attack succeeds, the opponent suffers damage and then must make a size-adjusted Paralysis saving throw. If the opponent’s save succeeds, he stands his ground. If the opponent’s save fails, he is forced back a number of feet equal to the damage dealt by the combatant. If this would push the opponent into a wall or obstacle, the opponent is knocked down, taking 1d6 bludgeoning damage per 10’ he has traveled.

If the opponent is pushed into another character or monster, he is knocked **prone** if the character or monster he is pushed into is as large or larger than him. If the character or monster he is pushed into is smaller, the smaller character/monster is instead knocked **prone**, and the opponent continues to be forced back.

###### Incapacitate

Combatants can attempt to knock out rather than kill their opponents, e.g. attacking with the “flat of the blade”, pulling their blows, and so on. To make an incapacitating attack with a weapon, the combatant must make a melee attack throw with a -4 penalty. If the attack succeeds, it deals nonlethal damage. Brawling attacks (see above) are always nonlethal damage.

###### Knock Down

A combatant can attempt to trip, sweep, or otherwise knock his opponent down by special maneuver. To knock down an opponent, the combatant must make a melee attack throw with a -4 penalty. If the attack succeeds, the opponent suffers damage and then must make a size-adjusted Paralysis saving throw. If the opponent’s save succeeds, he stays on his feet. If the opponent’s save fails, he is knocked **prone**.

###### Overrun

A combatant can attempt to overrun an opponent’s position without stopping to fight him. To overrun an opponent, the combatant must make a melee attack throw with a -4 penalty. If the attack succeeds, the opponent must then make a Paralysis saving throw. If the save succeeds, the opponent can choose to block the combatant, allowing the combatant to deal damage as if he had struck him with an ordinary attack. If the opponent fails on his saving throw, or chooses not to block the combatant, the combatant gains a bonus movement action and bonus combat action. The bonus movement action can only be used to move straight ahead through the opponent he has overrun by up to the combatant’s combat speed, less any movement he has already taken that initiative segment. The bonus combat action can only be used to make an attack, including another overrun.

A combatant that is **engaged** by several opponents that wishes to overrun them must sequentially overrun each opponent until has either overrun all engaging opponents or qualifies for passage of lines (p. XX).

###### Sunder

A combatant can attempt to break his opponent’s weapon or shield with a forceful blow. To sunder a weapon or shield, a combatant must make on a melee attack throw. There is a -4 penalty on the attack throw to sunder staffs, spears, and polearms, and a -6 penalty on the attack throw to sunder any other weapons or shields. If the attack succeeds, the opponent suffers damage and then must make a Paralysis saving throw. Subtract any magic bonus from the sundering weapon from the save, and add any magic bonus from the targeted weapon or shield. Daggers, swords, and shields gain a +4 bonus on the save, while staffs, spears, and polearms suffer a -4 penalty. If the saving throw is successful, the opponent’s weapon or shield is unharmed. If the saving throw is unsuccessful, the opponent’s weapon or shield is broken. Regardless of the attack and saving throw result, magic weapons and shields can only be sundered by weapons with a magic bonus equal to or greater than their own.

###### Sweep Attack

A combatant can make a sweep attack that strikes multiple targets at once. To make a sweep attack, the combatant first designates two or more targets **engaged** by him, and then makes an attack throw against each target. Each target that he successfully attacks then suffers damage equal to the ordinary damage of his attack divided by the total number of targets (including those he missed), rounded down. A sweep attack does not trigger special effects that would otherwise occur, including the additional damage from impact weapons. For instance, a giant roc making a sweep attack with its talons cannot **grab** targets. If the combatant successfully incapacitates more than half of the targets, he can cleave after the sweep attack. The cleave can be an ordinary attack or a sweep attack, as desired. A sweep attack only counts as one attack towards the combatant’s cleave limits, regardless of the number of targets.

EXAMPLE: A lesser titan equipped with a mace (6d6 damage) is engaged with four orcs. The titan makes a sweep attack on all four. He attacks each separately, hitting three but missing one. Each of the three he hit suffers damage equal to one-fourth his ordinary damage, since he attacked four targets. He rolls 6d6 and the result is 20. Each of the three orcs suffers (20/4) damage, rounded down, or 5 damage. This is enough to incapacitate the orcs. Since he killed more than half of his four targets, the titan can cleave. He uses his cleave to smash the remaining orc, hitting it for 6d6 damage.

###### Wrestling

A combatant can attempt to wrestle with an opponent. To wrestle an opponent, a combatant must make a melee attack throw with a -4 penalty. He can ignore the target’s AC from armor when making this attack, but not AC from DEX, magic bonus, natural armor, or spells. If the attack succeeds, the opponent must then make a size-adjusted Paralysis saving throw. If the opponent’s save succeeds, he has shrugged off the combatant. If the opponent’s save fails, he has been **wrestled**.

### Conditions

Conditions alter a creature’s capabilities in a variety of ways and can arise as a result of a spell, a class power, a proficiency, a monster’s attack, or other effect. Most conditions, such as **blinded**, are impairments, but a few, such as **invisible**, can be advantageous. A condition lasts either until it is countered (the prone condition is countered by standing up, for example) or for a duration specified by the effect that imposed the condition. If multiple effects impose the same condition on a creature, each instance of the condition has its own duration, but the condition’s effects don’t get worse. A creature either has a condition or doesn’t. For details on the effects of specific conditions, see Appendix B, **Conditions**.

###### General Rules for Conditions

The following rules apply to all conditions, except where otherwise noted:

* A condition that prevents a creature from casting spells also prevents the creature from using scrolls but not spell-like abilities.
* A condition that prevents a creature from moving also prevents the creature from taking actions in lieu of moving, such as standing up from being knocked down, sheathing one weapon and drawing another, readying or losing a shield, picking an item off the ground, or retrieving an item from a pack or sack.
* A condition that prevents a creature from attacking also prevents the creature from taking actions in lieu of attacking that could not be taken as actions in lieu of moving, such as drinking a magic potion, lighting a torch, using a magic item, or turning undead.
* If a condition reduces a creature’s speed, the reduction applies to all types of movement, including combat, encounter, expedition, and any special movement.

###### Escaping from the Grabbed, Restrained, and Wrestled Conditions

The grabbed, restrained, and wrestled conditions can be ended with a successful escape. An escape is a combat action.

When attempting to escape from being grabbed or wrestled, a creature has to two options. First, it can attempt to slip free with a size-adjusted Paralysis saving throw. Second, it can attempt to break free with a Dungeonbashing proficiency throw. If the creature has Contortionism proficiency, it gains a +4 bonus on either throw.

When attempting to escape from being restrained, a creature may in some cases have the option to slip free or break free, as above. Sometimes the creature might also or instead have the option to cut free by, e.g., slashing off the tentacle which is restraining it. To cut itself free, a creature must successfully deal a particular amount of damage (noted in the monster’s description) to the creature or appendage that has restrained it.

### Morale

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Monster Morale** | |
| **Adjusted Die Roll** | **Result** |
| 2- | Frightened Retreat |
| 3 – 5 | Morale Faltering |
| 6 – 8 | Fight On |
| 9 – 11 | Advance and Pursue |
| 12+ | Victory or Death |

Player characters always have a choice whether they will fight, surrender, or run away in an encounter. The Judge decides whether monsters surrender or run away. Monsters have a listing for **morale**, which represents how likely they are to fight or flee when in an encounter. Morale is rated from -6 to +4. A score of -6 indicates that the monster never fights (unless absolutely cornered), while a score of +4 indicates the monster will fight until killed.

The Judge makes a **morale roll** at the end of each round for a group when one-third the group has been killed or otherwise incapacitated, and each round thereafter that another creature in the group is killed, to determine if the monsters fight on. The Judge also makes a morale roll for a group at the end of the first round that the adventurers flee from it order to determine whether the monsters pursue.

The Judge makes a morale roll for a solitary creature when it loses one-third their hit points, and each round thereafter that the creature is damaged. He also makes a morale roll for the creature at the end of the first round that the adventurers all flee from it.

To make a morale roll, the Judge rolls 2d6, adding the morale rating of the monsters, along with any other adjustments he feels are reasonable, and consults the Monster Morale table. Suggested morale roll modifiers are as follows:

* Creature has lost 1/2 or more of its starting HP -2
* Creature has lost 2/3 or more of its starting HP -5
* Group outnumbers opponents +2
* Group outnumbers opponents by 2:1 or more +5
* Group has lost 1/2 or more of starting creatures -2
* Group has lost 2/3 or more of starting creatures -5
* Creature or group cannot retreat and enemy is not accepting surrender +5

###### Morale Results

**Frightened retreat** means that the creatures become **frightened**. Frightened creatures cannot attack, cast spells, or speak (except to scream in stark terror). They will run from the enemy at their full speed until they are no longer pursued by any enemies or 1d10 rounds passes. Frightened creatures that cannot flee begin **cowering** in terror. Engaged frightened creatures will cower in terror until able to flee with defensive movement. Cowering creatures are **vulnerable** and cannot attack, cast spells, move, or take any other actions until the condition ends. Cowering creatures will surrender if terms are offered.

**Morale faltering** means the creatures begin **faltering**. Faltering creatures suffer a -2 penalty to make attack throws, proficiency throws, or saving throws versus the enemy. The creatures stop falteringif, at the end of their initiative, they are no longer engaged by any enemies. Faltering creatures will usually attempt a fighting withdrawal to end the condition. Faltering creatures might surrender if offered fair and reasonable terms such as safe passage with their arms, etc. (Judge’s discretion).

**Fight On** means that the monsters will continue the battle without retreating, but they will not pursue if their opponents flee. **Advance and Pursue** means the monsters will continue the battle without retreating, going on the offensive where possible, and pursuing should the characters retreat. **Victory or Death** means the monsters will fight on without retreating or needing to roll morale for the remainder of the battle. They will pursue any retreating opponents, and fight with ferocity and grim determination.

If the adventurers attempt to **surrender** to their enemies, it is up to the Judge to decide whether the enemies even listen, and under what terms they will accept surrender. The adventurers can decide how to react if their opponents make attempts to surrender.

###### The Perils of Cowardice

Fear makes running more perilous. Any time a frightened or faltering combatant moves through a doorway, makes a hard turn around a corner, or traverses an obstacle at running speed, it must make a Paralysis saving throw. Adventurers with Acrobatics can add their class level to the save. If the save is failed, the combatant falls at that point and moves no further that round. If the save succeeds, the combatant can keep moving for the remainder of his action. Bad luck can cause even the swiftest combatant to fall prey to pursuing foes.

If the monsters are put to flight, the adventurers can run after them or let them escape, as they choose. If the adventurers flee, the monsters will pursue if their morale roll results in Advance and Pursue or Victory or Death, continuing to do so for as long as the adventurers are visible to them at the end of the monster’s initiative. If the monsters enjoy treasure, they must make a Paralysis saving throw at +4 if the adventurers drop treasure worth at least their XP value. Hungry monsters of bestial intelligence must do the same if the characters drop a day’s rations for the creature. If the save fails, the monster(s) stop(s) to snatch up the treasure or meal.

### Mounted Combat

A creature controlling a mount is called a **rider**. A creature seated on a mount, but not controlling it, is called a **passenger**. While combatants will rarely ride mounts in dungeons, they will often do so during wilderness encounters. The following rules apply during mounted combat.

###### Mounted Initiative and Movement

A rider and any passengers act on their own initiative number. A mount acts on the rider’s initiative number. The rider chooses what actions he and/or his mount undertake, unless it is frightened and fleeing. When the mount moves, the rider and passengers move with it, all using the mount’s speed. The rider and passengers are considered to have charged, retreated, run, or moved if the mount did so. (Therefore, a rider who wishes to cast spells must keep his mount stationary.) If either the rider or mount becomes **engaged**, both are considered engaged.

A rider or passenger can mount onto or dismount from a stationary mount as an action in lieu of attacking. A rider or passenger with Mounted Combat or Riding proficiency can mount onto or dismount from a stationary or moving mount as an action in lieu of movement. When mounting, the combatant must be within 5’ of the mount, which must not be hostile to him. When dismounting, the combatant can place himself anywhere within 5’ of the mount. A combatant dismounting from an aerial mount begins falling.

###### Mounted Attacks

If the mount moved but did not charge or take another full-round action, then either the rider, the passengers, or the mount can take a combat action (but not both). If the mount remained stationary, either the mount or both the rider and the passengers can take combat actions, but not all three. If the mount charged, then either the rider or the passengers can attack at the end of the charge, and the mount can usually also attack if war-trained. (Some mounts, such as camels, do not attack on a charge.) Riders and passengers with impact weapons will deal impact damage. Some mounts will deal impact damage, depending on their type.

If the mount remained stationary and the rider attacked with a missile weapon, the mount can take its movement action *after* the rider’s attack, as if the mount had readied a movement action triggered by the rider’s attack.

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | Mount Moved | Mount Stationary | Mount Charged |
| Rider | Can attack if passenger and mount don’t | Can attack if mount doesn’t | Can attack |
| Passenger | Can attack if rider and mount don’t | Can attack if mount doesn’t | Can attack |
| Mount | Can attack if rider and passenger don’t | Can attack if rider and passenger don’t;  Can move after rider’s missile attack | Can usually attack if war-trained |

A rider or passenger with Mounted Combat or Riding proficiency can stay mounted during attacks. However, a rider or passenger without one of those proficiencies must make a Paralysis saving throw after each attack he makes or the mount makes (including cleaves). If the save succeeds, he stays mounted. If the save fails, he is knocked off the mount. Combatants knocked off a mount are dismounted, knocked **prone**, and suffer 1d4 bludgeoning damage. Combatants knocked off an aerial mount into the sky takes no damage but begin falling.

If a rider or mount makes or is the target of a **force back** or **overrun** special maneuver, the mount’s size is used to determine the saving throw and effects.

A rider with Mounted Combat or Riding can take advantage of the mount’s height when attacking. Compare the size of the rider’s mount to the size of the target. (If the target is itself mounted, compare the size of the rider’s mount to the size of the target’s mount.) If the rider’s mount is larger, the target counts as **subjacent** to the rider.

###### Mounted Defenses

A rider or passenger without a military saddle must make a Paralysis saving throw every time they or the mount are dealt damage, unless they have both Riding and Mounted Combat proficiency. If the save succeeds, the rider or passenger stays mounted. If the save fails, the rider or passenger is knocked off the mount. If either the rider or mount is reduced to 0 hit points, everyone on the mount is automatically knocked off (as above).

If a mount fails a morale roll due to becoming injured, a rider with Mounted Combat or Riding proficiency can attempt to calm the mount as an action in lieu of attacking. This allows the mount to make a new morale roll at the end of the round.

### Vehicle Combat

A creature controlling a vehicle is called a **driver**. A creature riding on a vehicle under another’s control is called a **passenger**. A creature pulling a vehicle, carrying a vehicle with its hands and shoulders, or carrying a vehicle on its back, is called a **transporter**.The driver can be one of the transporters in some cases, e.g. the driver of a palanquin carrying a prisoner will be one of the transporters. The following rules apply during vehicular combat.

###### Vehicle Initiative, Movement, and Attacks

A driver and any passengers act on their own initiative number. Transporters act on the driver’s initiative number. The driver chooses what actions he and the transporters undertake, unless the transporters are frightened and fleeing. When the transporters move, the driver, passengers, and vehicle move with it, all using the vehicle’s speed. The rider and passengers are considered to have charged, retreated, run, or moved if the transporters did so. If either the driver or any transporters becomes **engaged**, all are considered engaged.

A rider or passenger can mount onto or dismount from a stationary vehicle as an action in lieu of attacking. A rider or passenger with Mounted Combat or Driving proficiency can mount onto or dismount from a stationary or moving vehicle as an action in lieu of movement. When mounting, the combatant must be within 5’ of the vehicle, whose transporters must not be hostile to him. When dismounting, the combatant can place himself anywhere within 5’ of the vehicle. A combatant dismounting from an aerial vehicle begins falling.

###### Vehicle Attacks

If the vehicle did not charge or take another full-round action, then driver and the passengers can take a combat action. The transporters cannot attack, with one exception: A transporter that is carrying the vehicle on its back can take a combat action. For instance, an elephant carrying a howdah can attack.

If the vehicle charged, the driver is busy driving and cannot attack. The passengers can make melee attacks at the end of the charge. The transporters can also make melee attack provided they are pulling the vehicle or carrying the vehicle on their back. For instance, a team of horses pulling a chariot or an elephant carrying a howdah could attack after the charge, but laborers carrying a palanquin could not. Passengers and transporters with impact weapons will deal impact damage.

If a vehicle is the target of a **force back** or **overrun** special maneuver, the vehicle’s size is used to determine the saving throw and effects.

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | Vehicle Didn’t Charge | Vehicle Charged |
| Driver | Can attack | Cannot attack |
| Passenger | Can attack | Can melee attack |
| Transporters | Can attack if carrying vehicle on back | Can melee attack if carrying on back or pulling vehicle |

###### Vehicles and Damage

If the vehicle is reduced to 0 structural hit points, everybody on it is automatically knocked off (as above). Transporters can ignore the frightened condition so long as less than half the transporters are also frightened.

## Earning Experience from Adventures

Adventures are dangerous, but the rewards are great. All characters that survive an adventure alive receive experience points (XP). Experience points are gained from two sources while on adventures: treasure and monsters.

### Experience from Treasure

Characters gain XP from treasure they recover from the dungeon or wilderness and bring back to civilization. For purposes of earning XP, “civilization” includes any friendly settlement or stronghold and/or any hex of civilized territory. Sometimes figuring out how to get a dragon’s hoard back to town can be an adventure in itself.

###### Non-Magical Treasure

The characters receive 1 XP per 1 gold piece (gp) value of treasure recovered on adventures. For purposes of XP “treasure” includes all coins, gems, jewels, and merchandise, and other valuables worth at least 1sp per stone (about the price of wheat).

EXAMPLE: After killing a warband of kobolds, the adventurers recover two suits of plate armor (worth 60gp each) and 100 st of firewood (worth 1gp total). Plate armor has an encumbrance of 6 st, making it worth 10 gp per st. It counts as treasure for XP purposes. The firewood is worth 1cp per stone, so it does not count as treasure.

###### Magical Treasure

If the party recovers magic items on an adventure, they receive XP equal to the apparent value of the item, i.e. what it would be worth if it were non-magical. The ***ACKS II Judges Journal*** lists the apparent value of most magic items, which is typically about the same value as a non-magical masterwork. However, if the party identifies a magic item and sells it without using the item, they receive an additional 1 XP per 1gp earned in the sale. If the characters use the items, they do not get any additional XP, even if later sold.

**Designer’s Note:** The Judge is the final arbiter of what counts as treasure. Some players have been known to pursue treasure XP to somewhat absurd degrees – carrying off building bricks, collecting seashells, or gathering firewood, as treasure. Limiting treasure XP to objects worth at least 1sp per stone excludes such items from counting. The intent is to encourage the players to focus on real treasure and not act like stars of a pawnshop reality TV show. Limiting treasure XP from sale of magic items to unused items prevents characters from using such items to help them adventure, then selling the magic items for XP later, benefiting twice.

###### Other Treasure

If the party receives a reward of treasure for accomplishing a task on an adventure, or captures a prisoner that can be ransomed or sold, the party gains treasure XP equal to the value of the reward, ransom, or sale price once it is received.

If the party earns income from wages or business transactions, the characters do not earn treasure XP. However, characters can get campaign XP from arbitrage trading of merchandise found on adventures, even if the merchandise does not itself provide adventuring XP (see p. XX).

### Experience from Monsters

All defeated monsters (either outsmarted, captured, or killed), grant XP based on how powerful they are. Monsters begin with a base XP determined by Hit Dice (HD), and receive a bonus for each special ability they have (fire breath, spell-like abilities, etc.). Refer to the Monster Experience Points table below. To determine the number of special abilities a monster has, count the number of asterisks next to its Hit Dice in its **Monster Listing** in the ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual****.*

To calculate a monster’s XP, begin with the base XP value for its Hit Dice. Add the value for the XP bonus per ability, multiplied by the number of special abilities the monster has. A lamia is a HD 9 creature with 3 special abilities, so her bonus XP is (3 x 600 = 1,800). A group of adventurers receives 2,500 XP (700 + 1,800) for each lamia they defeat.

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Monster Experience Points** | | |
| **Monster HD** | **Base XP** | **Bonus XP/Ability** |
| **Less than 1** | 5 | 1 |
| **1** | 10 | 3 |
| **1+** | 15 | 6 |
| **2** | 20 | 9 |
| **2+** | 35 | 12 |

| **5** | 200 | 150 |
| **5+** | 260 | 200 |
| **6** | 320 | 250 |
| **6+** | 380 | 300 |

| **20** | 2,800 | 1,800 |
| **21**\* | 3,000 | 2,000 |
| \*For monsters of HD 22 and higher, add a cumulative 250 XP for the Base and Bonus categories. | | |

### Allocating XP

The totals for each monster defeated are calculated and added to the value of all XP from treasure, and the sum for all XP is divided evenly among all party members who returned to civilization (alive or dead), with henchmen receiving a half share each.

EXAMPLE: A group consisting of Elaria (PC), Norden (PC), Avaro (henchman). and Drakima (henchman) kill a 5 HD monster worth 200 XP, and find a gold statue worth 500gp and a gem worth 200gp. 200 XP from monsters and 700 XP from gp are added up to 900 XP. The XP is then allocated across (1 + 1 + 0.5 + 0.5) = 3 shares. Elaria and Norden get 900 XP / 3 shares x 1 share = 300 XP. Avaro and Drakima get 900 XP / 3 shares x 1/2 share = 150 XP each.

XP is divided **only** among party members who return to civilization. Deceased party members who are left behind on the adventure do not receive a share of XP. Deceased party members who are brought back to civilization do receive a share of XP. If a deceased party member receives XP and is not restored to life within a day, the XP is applied to the player’s reserve XP (see below).

Sometimes, the exact moment when XP is allocated can be relevant. What if one adventurer is delayed by a few hours while his party members advance ahead with the treasure? Unless the Judge determines otherwise due to special circumstances, the division of XP occurs when the first member of the party reaches civilization, and is allocated to each party member as they arrive. This allows adventurers to “trickle in” over hours or days, or to press ahead for urgent tasks, etc.

### Adjustments to XP

Characters receive XP bonuses or penalties based on their score in their class key attributes, as detailed in Chapter 2, **Characters**. All bonuses or penalties are applied to the grand total XP a particular character receives at the end of an adventure. For example, if Balbus the Blessed receives 1,200 XP at the end of an adventure, and he has a key attribute that grants him +10% to experience, then the total XP after this bonus that Balbus receives is 1,320 XP ((1,200 x .10) + 1,200 = 1,320).

### Character Advancement

When a character has accumulated enough XP to go up in level, the player should do the following:

1. Note down the character’s new level and title and the number of XP needed to advance to the next level.
2. Re-roll the character’s hit points using his new number of hit dice, adding his Constitution bonus or penalty to each die rolled. Note the result as his new hit points on your character sheet. If, due to ill luck, his new hit points would be less than or equal to his hit points at his prior level of experience, he gains just 1 hit point.
3. Check to see if the character has improved or gained any class abilities and write them down on the character sheet.
4. Choose any new proficiencies from the **Proficiencies** chapter and any new spells from the **Spells** chapter that the character may be eligible for.
5. Update the character’s attack throws and saving throws.

Characters can never earn enough experience to advance 2 levels or more in one adventure. For example, if Arial is a 1st level elven spellsword with 0 XP, she should receive no more than 7,999 XP in one adventure (a huge sum!), which is 1 XP short of reaching 3rd level.

### Character Death

Not every character who becomes an adventurer will advance to maximum level. The fate of many characters is to die along the way. Dead characters can sometimes be brought back to life for another adventure, but even with powerful magic available, some characters will be permanently slain.

If the deceased character had no henchmen, or if his player doesn’t want to play any of them, the player can use a “back-up” he has previously generated or roll up a new character. A back-up or new character starts at 1st level with 0 XP unless the player has established a **reserve XP fund** or the party throws the deceased character a **heroic funeral**. Regardless of level, the back-up or new character begins with just the equipment for his template (or 3d6 x 10gp), unless the deceased character had made plans for **inheritance**.

If the deceased character had one or more henchmen, the player can elect to make one of those henchmen his new PC. The player simply takes over the henchman, at whatever his current level and XP, and begins playing him. If the deceased character had any other henchmen, they will depart the party unless they are recruited by the new player character or one of his party members. A henchman cannot benefit from reserve XP or heroic funerals, but can benefit from inheritance.

###### Reserve XP Fund

A reserve XP fund is a fund of experience points established by a player that serves as an XP floor for all of the player’s future characters. The number of experience points in the reserve is equal to 90% of the gold piece value of money allocated to the reserve. Money is allocated to the reserve by spending it to no other tangible game benefit whatsoever. This could include anonymous tithes to churches; reckless spending on wine, women, and song; elaborate funeral pyres for deceased henchmen; and so on. When the player begins playing a new character, the new character starts with XP equal to the XP reserve, rather than start at 0.

EXAMPLE: Amargein, a 5th level fighter, returns from a successful adventure laden with gold. In a reckless orgy, he spends 3,400gp carousing through the city of Aura. As this is money spent to no real in-game benefit, Amargein’s player notes that he has set aside a reserve XP fund of 3,060 XP (90% of the amount spent carousing). On his next adventure, Amargein is tragically slain. When Amargein’s player rolls up a new character, he will begin with 3,060xp, which is used to advance his character before play begins.

The XP reserve fund does not get depleted by use. The player’s new character can further increase the reserve fund while alive by spending money to no tangible game benefit whatsoever, and the player’s next new character would then be able to begin with even more XP. However, at no point can a new character ever enter play with more XP than the prior character. The XP reserve fund belongs to the player, not the character, and cannot be transferred between players.

EXAMPLE: Amargein’s player has created a new character, Beorn. Beorn begins play with 3,060xp. In his next adventure, Beorn finds a treasure trove worth 2,500gp, which (because gold grants XP) increases his XP up to 5,560xp. He spends 1,000gp of the trove erecting a ridiculous memorial to Amargein in the city’s most expensive cemetery, which increases his XP reserve fund by 900 XP (90% of the amount spent) to 3,960 XP. The following day, Beorn is killed by an assassin. The player can now create a character with 3,960g XP.

###### Heroic Funerals

If an adventurer dies heroically, his party members can honor him in death with a **heroic funeral**. A heroic funeral might include burning the deceased in a funeral pyre, burying him in a ship, interring him in a great barrow-mound, erecting a cenotaph or mausoleum, etc. In any case, the deceased adventurer must be sent off to the afterlife with a substantial amount of treasure, either buried with him or expended on funeral games, mourners, and memorials.

The beneficiary of a fallen adventurer’s heroic funeral is the player of the deceased character. His new character can enter the game with additional experience points equal to 90% of the gold piece value of money spent on the funeral and/or interred with his character on top of whatever XP is in the reserve fund. However, at no point can a new character ever enter play with more XP than the prior character. The new character can be a friend or relation of the deceased (often his heir, described below), and is assumed to be guided and inspired by the spirit of the slain.

Adventurers who die unheroically, due to their own cowardice, greed, or stupidity, or who are slain while cowering, frightened, faltering, or retreating, cannot benefit from a heroic funeral. Their spirit wanders aimlessly in the grey mists of the underworld. This is left to the Judge’s discretion, but the intent of the rule is to alleviate the pain of character loss for players who die in heroic fashion to save the lives of their party members, protect innocents, and so on.

Should players abuse this rule by having their characters loot the barrow-mound of a deceased player character following his funeral (to get back the treasure they interred therein), the characters perpetrating this perfidy are immediately transformed into wights and cursed to forever haunt the barrow. (Readers may draw their own conclusions as to whether the undead’s ability to **enervate** is actually an existential statement about the impact that players who exploit game mechanics can have on the Judge’s life energies!)

###### Inheritance

With the Judge’s permission, a henchman, back-up character, or new character can be declared to be the **heir** of the prior character. The Judge might allow players to create a will for their characters in order to leave treasure behind for an heir (often a henchman or party member, but sometimes a family member that might become a player character in the future). If this is done, the treasure is usually stored with a reputable bank, which will charge a total of 10% of the treasure for their services, taxes, etc. Magic items will be priced at their market value; adventurers who lie about their items to avoid paying high fees might find themselves receiving what they claimed to own, rather than what they owned. (“It says here the wand only had 2 charges left when you consigned it to us.”)

A player might try to leave money to an heir through less safe means, such as burying it and leaving a map behind, but this is obviously more risky. A player of a character who did not establish a will and heir might be allowed by the Judge to play a relative coming to collect his old character’s belongings once, but in the future should make more concrete plans if he wishes to retain his possessions.

If a character dies without an heir, any of his treasure deposited under his name (in a bank, warehouse, etc.) and any real property owned by the character are lost — assumed to be seized by the government, distant family members, and so on. Other personal property (such as armor, weapons, or equipment on his person) fall into the hands of their new possessors, who are probably his former party members.

### 0th Level Characters and Experience from Adventuring

A 0th level character who participates in an adventure will earn experience points. When a 0th level character earns 500 XP from adventuring, he advances to become a 1st level character of a class determined by the Judge based on his attributes, his existing proficiencies, and his adventures to date. (Some 0th level characters might need more or less XP to advance, as detailed in the ***ACKS II* *Judges Journal***.) The character gains the Adventuring proficiency and the attack throws, saving throws, class powers, and proficiencies of his new class. The character re-rolls his hit points using his new class’s Hit Die, keeping either his new hp total or his prior hp total +1 if that is higher.

The new 1st level character retains any proficiencies he already knew. If these proficiencies are equivalent to any of the class powers of his new class, they are replaced by the newly-gained class powers. If the proficiencies are not part of his class powers, they count against his limit of proficiencies from level, INT and/or time and training (p. XX). If he has more general proficiencies than permitted by level, INT, and time and training, he loses one proficiency each month of game time, representing the erosion of his old professional skills over time. If he has more class proficiencies than permitted, or class proficiencies not permitted to his class at all, he loses them when he advances to 1st level.

EXAMPLE: Muad is an Opelenean spice merchant with INT 16 who has the following proficiencies: Bargaining, Bribery, Diplomacy, Naturalism, and Profession (merchant) 3. One day, Elaria recruits Muad as a 0th level henchman and begins to take him on adventures with her. The erstwhile spicer gains 500 XP after a particularly harrowing escapade involving flesh-eating desert ghouls, and becomes 1st level. Because of his background and proficiencies, the Judge decides that Muad advances into the venturer class.

As a 1st level venturer, Muad gains the Bribery, Diplomacy, Expert Bargainer, Expert Traveler, Mercantile network, Multilingual, Pathfinding, and Treachery class powers and can select one class and one general proficiency. His Bargaining, Bribery, and Diplomacy proficiencies are replaced by the class powers of the same name. Naturalism becomes his 1st level general proficiency. His first two ranks of Profession (Merchant) use up his bonus proficiencies from INT 16. Profession (Merchant) 3 uses up one proficiency from time and training. He is left with one empty class proficiency slot, which he can fill from the Venturer class list.

Had the Judge unwisely decided that Muad advanced into the mage class, he would have gained the Arcane Magic and Collegiate Wizardry class powers. He would lose Bribery entirely. Bargaining, Diplomacy, and Naturalism would be his general proficiencies from level and INT. Profession (merchant) 3 would occupy three of his four possible time and training proficiencies, leaving him less flexible in the future.

# Chapter 7: Voyages

Adventures on the high seas are called **voyages** and can challenge the characters with lacerating weather, sea monsters, and enemy vessels. Whether they are following moldy treasure maps, seeking out lost civilizations, exploring what lies beyond the horizon, or simply pirating and swashbuckling, maritime adventure awaits!

## Seafarers

Two types of NPCs commonly appear during sea voyages. **Mariners** are specialists that can row, sail, and steer vessels. **Marines** are mercenaries that can fight on ships. All mariners and marines must be provided with food and water by their employer in addition to wages. Mariners and marines do not have Swimming proficiency and usually drown if they fall overboard or their ship is sunk.

###### Mariners

**Rowers and Sailors:** Rowers are skilled oarsmen with Seafaring (rowing) proficiency. They can handle oars and paddles, operate steering oars, and maintain vessels in working order. Sailors are able seamen with Seafaring (sailing) proficiency. They can hitch ropes, trim sails, operate steering oars, and maintain vessels in working order. Rowers and sailors cost 6gp per month.

Because their skills are valuable to every marine realm, sailors and rowers on vessels are reluctant to fight against human or demi-human opponents because they know they will just be captured rather than killed. If forced to fight, they do so with AC 0, Speed 120’, HD 1-1, #AT 1 11+, Dmg by weapon, ML -1. They have weapon proficiency in club, hand axe, net, and staff. They have no proficiency in weapon-and-shield, or dual weapon styles, nor in other weapons or any armor.

Conscripts or militia called up from a domain can be trained as rowers and sailors; training time and cost are as per light infantry (p. XX). If conscripts, militia, or other unproficient characters attempt to row or sail vessels, they do so poorly. The vessel’s speed is reduced as if it were missing crew, with each unproficient character counting as 0.5 missing crew. Time spent under oar or under sail counts as training time.

**Navigator:** Navigators are skilled experts in charting course by the sun, moon, stars, wind patterns, and water currents. To qualify as a navigator a character must have one rank of Seafaring proficiency and either the Pathfinding class power or the Navigation proficiency. Rowers and sailors treat each day they spend out of sight of land without a navigator on board as a morale calamity. Navigators cost 25gp per month. 25% of navigators are 1st level characters.

**Captain**: Captains are skilled mariners who know how to command vessels. To qualify as a captain, a character must have two ranks of Seafaring proficiency. If a vessel lacks a captain, it suffers a -4 penalty on any Seafaring proficiency throws. Captain cost 100gp per month. 25% of captains are 3rd level characters.

**Master Mariners:** Master mariners are captains with three ranks of Seafaring proficiency. Master mariners treat points of sail as one step more favorable, and grant their vessel a +4 bonus on Seafaring proficiency throws and ramming attack throws. Master mariners cost 250gp per month. 25% of master mariners are 4th level characters.

Roll 1d10 to determine the class of leveled mariners: 1 fighter, 2 – 5 explorer, 6 – 9 venturer, 10 Judge’s choice of any class. Mariners of higher than 4th level do not make themselves available for hire in the market but might be found on adventures.

The number of mariners required to fully crew a vessel depends on the type of vessel. Navigators, captains, and master mariners count as sailors (not rowers!) for purposes of crewing a vessel. The number of mariners available depends on the size of the market where they are recruited. If the number available is insufficient to crew his vessel(s), a domain or realm leader (or representative thereof) can recruit mariners from throughout the domain or realm to serve in their navies. The Naval Specialist Availability by Realm Size table shows how many of each type of specialist is available in each size of realm and how long they take to arrive. As with mercenaries, the listed realms are of minimum population for their type and can be scaled up for larger realms. The specialists arrive at the same rate as mercenaries, and as with finding and hiring mercenaries in a realm, there is a gp cost associated with finding and hiring specialists throughout the realm. The fee is identical to that for recruiting mercenaries from a realm (p. XX).

| Master Mariner | 1,800 | 145 | 36 | 9 | 2 | 1 | - | - |

###### Marines

Marines can be hired as mercenaries or called up as conscripts or militia to be trained. Any light infantry, slingers, bowmen, heavy infantry, long bowmen, and/or crossbowmen can serve as marines, but not mounted troops. The weight of the weapons and armor carried by the marines counts against the cargo capacity of the vessel they serve on.

EXAMPLE: Phaedra hires 75 heavy infantry with banded plate armor (5 st each) and polearms (1 st each) to serve as marines on her 5-rower galley. The marines’ equipment counts as 75 x (5 + 1) = 450 stone of cargo.

Up to 10% of mercenaries recruited from a coastal realm or port city might be **elite marines** (Judge’s discretion). Elite marines are able to fight as well as serve as either sailors or rowers. Elite marines cost 3gp per month more than ordinary mercenaries of their type.

The exact composition of a marine contingent can vary from realm to realm or even vessel to vessel. The Auran Empire favors a mix of one-third bowmen and two-thirds heavy infantry armed with polearms, while the Syrnasos islanders favor a mix of one-half bowmen and one-half light infantry with javelins. The Jutlanders field elite marines that serve as sailors or rowers but fight as heavy infantry.

Remember that if a vessel is equipped with artillery pieces or war machines, it will need crew for each machine. If the machine is an artillery piece, its crew should include an artillerist or the artillery piece will suffer penalties to its rate of fire and accuracy (p. XX). War machine crew count against the total number of marines that can be carried. The weight of war machines counts against the cargo capacity of the vessel, as does any ammunition carried.

Additional marines can be carried below deck as cargo. Each additional marine carried in this manner takes up 50 st of cargo space. Marines below deck cannot attack or be attacked until they move to the top deck. The top deck will usually not have room for more than the standard compliment of marines to fight at once.

###### Mariner and Marine Morale and Loyalty

Like all hirelings, mariners and marines have **morale scores** and **loyalty scores.** Morale score is the crew’s confidence in battle. Marine morale is based on their training and equipment (p. XX). Sailor and rower morale scores are -1, or -2 if untrained. Navigators, captains, and master mariners have morale scores of 0, or +1 if leveled. Morale rolls (but not the base score) are modified by the employer’s **morale modifier** (p. XX) when he leads them in battle. Loyalty is the crew’s fidelity to their employer. Mariners have a base loyalty score of 0. Marines have a base loyalty score of -2, or 0 if elite marines. Loyalty scores are permanently modified by the leader’s Charisma modifier.

The same rules for morale and loyalty apply as they do to hirelings retained by adventurers (p. xx), except as noted hereafter. When fielding navies, morale rolls and loyalty scores are tracked and rolled on a unit-by-unit base for events that occur to the unit.

Morale rolls for marines and mariners are made in combat when they suffer casualties (p. XX and p. XX). Loyalty rolls are made any time the vessel suffers a **calamity**. A calamity includes fleeing from a battle, suffering 25% or greater casualties, being out of supply for a week, going without pay for a month, or being out of sight of land without a navigator. If the crew are suffering from more than one calamity at once, there is a -2 penalty on the die roll per calamity after the first.

When making loyalty rolls, a result of **hostility** means that the crew mutinies immediately. A result of **resignation** means that the crew demands that the vessel head for the nearest friendly port. If the adventurers or captain agree to do so, the crew will continue to serve as crew until they reach the port, then disembark and resign. If the adventurers or captain refuse to do so, the crew will mutiny in 1d6 days.

## Sea Vessels

When adventuring at sea, characters sail or row on **sea vessels**. Some vessels are small, and they can be steered by an adventuring party. Others require a great number of sailors or rowers to crew them.

**Crew** indicates the number of sailors, rowers, and/or marines a vessel can carry. Each vessel must be crewed by one or more sailors and rowers in order to move under sail or under oars. The number listed for sailors and rowers is a full complement of crew. Vessels with fewer crew move slower (see p. XX). The number listed for marines is the maximum number of marines that can be carried on deck. Crew do not count against a vessel’s cargo capacity, but rations for crew do (see p. XX).

**Combat Speed** is the distance the vessel can travel in one combat round. *Oar Sprint* demands maximum exertion from the rowers and cannot be maintained for more than 1 turns (10 rounds). *Oar Cruise* is a fast pace that can be sustained for one hour (6 turns). *Oar Slow* is an easy pace that can be maintained by the rowers indefinitely. *Sail* is the vessel’s speed under favorable winds at full sail.

**Voyage Speed** is the distance in miles the vessel can travel in a 12-hour day of sailing or rowing. Voyage speed under oar is much slower than combat speed but can be maintained indefinitely. Travel speed under sail can be greatly affected by wind direction and strength. 1.5- and 2.5-rower galleys are designed to use oars to assist their sail speed if their sails are up, but do not so when cruising long distances. Therefore their relative sail combat speed is higher than voyage speed.

If a 2-, 3-, 4-, 6-, or 8-rower galley has its main mast stowed on board, its oar sprint speed and oar cruise speed are reduced by 30’ per round because there’s not enough room for the rowers to work. If a 2-, 3-, 4-, 6-, or 8-rower galley travels under sail without its main mast, its sail speed is reduced by 30’ per round and its sail voyage speed by 15 miles per day. 1.5- and 2.5-rower galleys do not face these difficulties.

**Cargo** is the carrying capacity of the vessel. The weight of crew do not count against cargo. Passengers can be carried as cargo at a weight of 50 stone each. Conversely, 50 st of cargo can be carried in lieu of each crew member.

**AC** indicates the armor class of the vessel.

**Structural Hit Points** (SHP) are the vehicular equivalent of hit points for creatures. When a vessel reaches 0 or less shp, it will sink in 1d10 rounds. Attacks by man-sized or large creatures cannot deal damage to vessels. Light and medium ballista deal 1/10 damage to vessels. Huge creatures, heavy ballista, and light catapults deal 1/3 to vessels. All other artillery, gigantic creatures, and colossal creatures deal full damage to vessels. Spells deal 1/10damage to wooden structures, increased if the spell has an area of effect by a factor of (AOE square footage / 25). (Some spells deal more damage to wooden structures, as noted in their description.)

See **Vessels** and **Vessel Descriptions** in Chapter 4 for more information about each type of vessel.

## Sea Voyages

Adventures on the high seas are called **voyages** and can challenge the characters with lacerating weather, sea monsters, and enemy vessels.

### Sailing the Seas

Speeds when traveling at sea are based on the type of vessel employed, the type of movement, and by the weather conditions. There are two types of movement, movement **under oar** and movement **under sail**. Movement under oar is less effected by the vagaries of wind direction. Movement under sail is faster over long distances than oar with favorable winds, but slower — much slower — when wind is unfavorable.

The voyage speeds listed on the Sea Vessels table are based on rowing or sailing for 12 hours each day with favorable winds. If gameplay requires movement to be adjudicated by hour, a vessel can move 1/12 the listed speed each hour. (Note that this is different than for creatures, where expedition speeds are based on traveling for 8 hours each day; crewing a vessel is considered an unstrenuous activity, so it can be performed for 12 hours per day.)

EXAMPLE: A large sailing ship has a voyage speed of 72 miles per 12-hour sailing day. Therefore it moves 6 miles per hour.

Vessels under sail in open seas with a navigator and full crew onboard can travel for 24 hours each day. By doing so, the vessel can travel twice the listed distance each day, although its hourly voyage speed is unchanged. Vessels traveling along a coastline, vessels under oar, vessels with less than the required crew, and/or vessels without a navigator must anchor or beach each night.

EXAMPLE: A large sailing ship in open seas with a navigator and full crew can sail 24 hours per day. It still moves 6 miles per hour but it will journey 144 miles every 24 hours.

###### Wind Direction

Every 12 hours, the Judge will roll 1d12 to determine **wind direction**. Movement of vessels under sail varies depending on the wind direction. Vessels under oar are not significantly affected by wind direction unless wind speed is very strong (see below).

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **D12** | **Wind Direction** |
| 1 | Northerly |
| 2 | Northeasterly |
| 3 | Easterly |
| 4 | Southeasterly |
| 5 | Southerly |
| 6 | Southwesterly |
| 7 | Westerly |
| 8 | Northwesterly |
| 9 – 12 | Prevailing wind direction for this locale |

The prevailing wind direction in the region of the Auran Empire depends on season and geography. Near the southern coast of the Ammasaurëan Sea, the winds are easterly in the summer and southwesterly in the winter. Near the northern coast of the Ammasaurëan, the winds are westerly in the summer and northwesterly in the winter. In campaigns outside of the Auran Empire setting, the Judge will determine the prevailing wind direction.

The Point of Sail diagram shows the effect that wind direction has on a vessel’s speed under sail. The vessels used on the Ammasaurëan Sea have shallow draft and small or no keels, making them awkward to handle under sail unless running before the wind. Vessels that are sailing in the direction opposite the wind are doing so by **tacking** (called “zigzagging” by landlubbers) between close hauled points of sail. Tacking vessels are moving at x1/3 speed but the zigzagging course means that they only move 66% of that distance in the direction they intend.

![](data:image/png;base64...)

EXAMPLE: Phaedra is commanding a sailing ship heading from Arganos to Aura. Her ship can sail 72 miles (12 hexes) per day. The first leg of her journey requires her to sail northwest along the southern coast. The Judge determines that the current wind direction is easterly. Using the Points of Sail diagram, the Judge sees that Phaedra’s vessel is broad reaching. Therefore she sails 72 x 2/3 = 48 miles over her 12-hour sailing day, for an average speed of 4mph. Had Phaedra been heading straight west, her ship would have been running before the wind and moved 72 miles over 12 hours. Had Phaedra been traveling straight east, her ship would have had to tack between close-hauled points, and would only progress 16 miles west over 12 hours, for an average speed of 1.5mph.

![](data:image/png;base64...)

**Master Mariners:** If the captain of a vessel under sail is a master mariner (three ranks of Seafaring) and has a full crew, he can treat the point of sail as one point more favorable. For instance, if his vessel is close-hauled, his vessel moves as if on a beam reach (x1/2 speed). If a master mariner’s vessel is on a beam reach, it moves as if broad reaching (x 2/3 speed), and so on.

###### Wind Strength

Every 12 hours, the Judge will roll 2d6 to determine **wind strength**. Add +2 to the wind strength roll if sailing in winter, when storms are more likely. Movement of vessels can vary greatly depending on the wind strength.

|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **2d6** | **Wind Speeds** | **Sail Speed** | **Oar Speed** | **Next Day’s Wind** | **Special Effect** |
| **2, 3, 4** | Still | x0 | x1 | -2 | None |
| **5, 6** | Gentle | x1/2 | x1 | -1 | None |
| **7, 8, 9** | Moderate | x1 | x1 | 0 | None |
| **10, 11** | Strong | x 3/2 | x1 | +1 | Cannot tack unless master mariner |
| **12, 13** | Very Strong | x2/3 | x2/3 | +2 | Cannot tack, Windy conditions |
| **14** | Gale | x2/3 or 0 | x2/3 or 0 | +4 | Damaged or drift, Stormy conditions |

**Still:** There is no wind. Vessels under sail cannot move. Vessels under oar can move at full speed. The Judge will apply a -2 penalty to the next day’s wind strength roll.

**Gentle:** Vessels under sail can only move at 1/2 speed. Vessels under oar can move at full speed. The Judge will apply a -1 penalty to the next day’s wind strength roll.

**Moderate:** Vessels under sail and oar can move at full speed.

**Strong:** Vessels under sail can move at 3/2 speed when close-hauled, beam reached, broad reached, or running before the wind. They cannot tack unless captained by a master mariner; master mariners can tack at 2/9 speed under strong wind. Vessels under oar can move at full speed. The Judge will apply a +1 bonus to the next day’s wind strength roll.

**Very Strong:** Vessels under sail must shorten their sails. They can move at only 2/3 speed and cannot tack unless captained by a master mariner (as above). Vessels under oar can move at only 2/3 speed because of choppy, swelling seas. Weather conditions will be Windy. The Judge will add +2 to the next day’s wind strength roll.

**Gale:** Gales will initially appear to be very strong winds. The Judge will roll 1d12 to randomly determine at what hour of the sailing day the weather worsens into a gale. When a gale begins, sailing ships can lower their sails. If the vessel lowers its sails, the vessel does not move for the remainder of the day. If the vessel does not lower its sails, the vessel can move as if under Very Strong Winds, but it suffers 2d8 slashing structural damage per hour sailed.

The effects of gales are worse on galleys than on sailing ships. When a gale begins, and each hour thereafter, the galley’s captain must make a Seafaring proficiency throw of 11+ (7+ if master mariner). If the galley is carrying a boarding bridge, the captain suffers -6 penalty to his throw. If the throw succeeds, the galley takes 2d8 structural slashing damage and moves at 2/3 speed for one hour. If the galley reaches the coast, it can beach to avoid further damage. If the coastline is clear terrain, the galley can automatically beach, but if not, the galley’s navigator must make a Navigation proficiency throw of 14+. If the navigator either is or is serving under a master mariner, he adds a +4 bonus to his throw. If the throw succeed, the navigator finds a safe beach. If the throw fails, the navigator does not find a safe beach. The galley must successfully move at sea for another hour before the navigator can try again.

If the throw fails, the galley takes 4d8 structural slashing damage and then moves 1d6 miles in the direction of the wind. If this random movement is enough to plunge the galley onto a coast, reef, or other obstacle, it takes 2d6 x 10 shp damage and is beached.

Weather conditions during a gale will always be Rainy and Stormy (see p. XX). The Judge will apply a +4 bonus to the next day’s wind strength roll. If the winds remain at Gale strength for two or more days, the winds whip up huge, dangerous waves. Each hour at sea, there is a 5% chance that a vessel is struck by a *capsizing wave* (as the spell).

### Visibility at Sea

|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Feature  Perceived | Daylight | Full  Moonlight | Half  Moonlight | Starlight |
| Coastline | 12 miles | 6 miles | 3 miles | 1.5miles |
| Vessel | 6 miles | 3 miles | 1.5 miles | 4,000’ |
| Fire | 6 miles | 6 miles | 6 miles | 6 miles |
| Flying Creatures | 1,800’ | 900’ | 450’ | 225’ |
| Submerged Creatures | 120’ | 60’ | 30’ | 15’ |

The surface of the sea offers lines of sight that are unmatched on land… but the depths can conceal untold terrors. The Maximum Visibility Distance table shows the maximum visibility distance that adventurers can perceive features of their environment such as mountains, islands, ships, or creatures under varying light conditions. Weather conditions can reduce maximum visibility as usual: In Rainy conditions, maximum visibility distance is halved while in Foggy or Snowy conditions, maximum visibility distance is reduced to a flat 20’.

### Navigating the Seas

Navigating the seas has two components – staying on course and avoiding nautical hazards.

###### Staying on Course

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Terrain** | **Navigation** |
| Lake or River | 4+ |
| Coast | 7+ |
| Open Sea | 11+ |

Getting lost is easy to do in the trackless expanse of endless ocean. At the start of each day or night of travel, the Judge will make a Navigation proficiency throw on the vessel’s behalf, using the target values listed in the table below. If any member of the crew has the Pathfinding class power or the Navigation proficiency, the vessel receives a +4 bonus on this proficiency throw, or a +8 bonus if the crew collectively knows both Pathfinding and Navigation. As with all throws, if the Judge rolls an unmodified roll of 1, the Navigation throw automatically fails.

If the throw succeeds, the vessel does not become lost. If the throw fails, the vessel becomes lost. The Judge should adjust his description of the wind direction to reflect the direction the crew believes it is traveling until they figure out their mistake. The effects of getting lost at sea are otherwise identical to those of getting list in the wilderness (p. XX).

###### Avoiding Nautical Hazards

Nautical hazards include underwater or partially submerged rocks, coral reefs, kelp forests, sandbars, shoals, sunken wrecks, and whirlpools. The Judge will determine the location of nautical hazards on a hex by hex basis on his map. Unless the hazard is a recent development, characters with Navigation and Seafaring proficiency will know about the hazards on common routes and can simply sail or row around them. Traveling into uncharted waters is much more dangerous.

When a vessel enters a hex containing a nautical hazard, the captain must make a Seafaring proficiency throw of 11+ (7+ if master mariner). If the vessel is moving at half speed or less, the captain gains a +4 bonus. If the vessel is a galley or longship, the captain gains +4 if navigating sandbars/shoals. If the throw succeeds, the vessel safely traverses the hex. If the throw fails, the vessel runs into the hazard, suffering the effects described below. The Judge can devise other nautical hazards for his setting. The suggestions for spells to escape nautical hazards are just that and are not intended to be an exclusive list of the ways a vessel might benefit from magic.

**Kelp Forest:** The vessel is entangled in seaweed. It cannot move until it is disentangled. Disentangling the vessel requires 1d4 hours plus an additional hour per 60 tons the vessel weighs. Spells such as *plant shrinkage*, *disintegration,* or *dominate plants* can instantly disentangle the vessel.

**Rock/Reef/Wreck:** The vessel strikes the hazard below the waterline and suffers 8d10 structural piercing damage. If the vessel was traveling at half speed or less when it entered the hex, damage is halved.

**Sandbar/Shoal:** The vessel runs aground and suffers 4d10 structural bludgeoning damage. If the vessel was traveling at half speed or less when it entered the hex, damage is halved. The vessel cannot move until it is refloated by high tide in 1d12 hours (Judge’s discretion) or until the vessel is freed from the shoal. The crew can attempt to free the vessel by lightening its load or by rocking it back and forth to dislodge it. Lightening the load grants a cumulative 5% chance the vessel escapes for every 200 st of cargo thrown overboard. Each crew member can unload 33 st of cargo per turn (200 st per hour). Rocking the vessel back and forth requires the entire crew to work at shifting ballast and cargo back and forth through the hold. Rocking the vessel grants a 5% cumulative chance per turn that the vessel escapes, but each time the roll fails the vessel suffers 1d4 structural bludgeoning damage. *Force of impetus* can dislodge the vessel immediately but deals 4d10 structural damage to it. *Earth’s movement* can dislodge the vessel in one turn.

**Whirlpool:** The vessel is sucked into a whirling maelstrom of water with spouting upswelling fountains and swirling vortices of depressed water. When the vessel enters the whirlpool, and at the end of each round that it remains in the whirlpool, it suffers 25-40 (1d4+4 x 5) structural bludgeoning damage and each crew member on deck must succeed on a Paralysis saving throw or be thrown overboard and must swim or drown. Swimming proficiencies suffer a -8 penalty in a whirlpool. On the captain’s initiative, he can make a Seafaring proficiency throw to steer out of the whirlpool. The target value is based on the vessel’s speed, as if targeted by a *capsizing wave* (p. XX). If the captain’s proficiency throw succeeds, the vessel escapes. If the captain’s proficiency throw fails, the vessel does not escape that round.

**Designer’s Note:** The rules above are intended to simulate the dangerous whirlpools that ancient mariners believed existed and those described in literature such as ***The Odyssey***,***A Descent into the Maelstrom***,and ***20,000 Leagues Under the Sea***.Actual whirlpools aren’t nearly as exciting.

### Surviving the Seas

Each day characters on a voyage must consume a daily ration of food and drink weighing a total of one stone, consisting of 2 lbs of food (1/ 6 st) and 1 gallon (5/6 st) of water. The total encumbrance of the rations carried is deducted from the vessel’s cargo capacity.

Characters that do not get their daily rations can become underfed, starving, and/or dehydrated. A vessel manned by underfed crew moves at half speed under oar or sail. A vessel crewed by starving or dehydrated crew moves at 1/3 speed under oar or sail. Becoming starved or dehydrated is a calamity that triggers morale rolls for the crew, posing a risk of mutiny!

###### Fishing

Characters at sea can fish each day that their vessel is becalmed or otherwise anchored. Fishing for food is a dedicated activity. For each day dedicated to fishing, each character can attempt a Fishing proficiency throw of 14+. A character with the Survival proficiency gains a +4 bonus on his Fishing proficiency throw. If the throw succeeds, the character brings in 1 stone of fish, i.e. enough to feed 6 man-sized creatures. (If the ship is in a rich fishing ground, fishing can gather much more food; see ***ACKS II Judges Journal***p. XX.)

###### Scurvy

Since standard rations spoil after one week, vessels on long sea voyages typically carry iron rations. After one month eating iron rations or caught fish, characters become **scurvy.** Scurvy characters lose 1 point of STR and CON immediately and another point of STR and CON each week thereafter. If either attribute reaches zero, the character dies. A scurvy character regains 1 point of STR and CON each day he eats a full ration of fresh food. Each time crewmembers lose points of STR and CON to scurvy, it counts as a calamity for their morale.

### Weathering the Seas

The Judge determines the prevailing weather for each day of the voyage. The effects of weather are in addition to any caused by wind direction and wind strength. Spells such as *control weather*, *control winds*, and *summon weather* can be invaluable to voyagers confronting bad weather.

###### Cold Temperatures

Cold temperatures do not affect the speed of vessels. They have their usual effect on characters. Characters below decks or in deckcastles or towers count as having protective clothing.

###### Hot Temperatures

Hot temperatures do not affect the speed of vessels. They have their usual effect on characters.

###### Foggy Conditions

Foggy conditions might occur when the wind strength is Still or Gentle. Foggy reduce the speed of vessels near a coast by half but do not affect speed in open sea. Foggy conditions drop visibility to 20’. Navigation proficiency throws suffer a -4 penalty in foggy conditions.

###### Rainy Conditions

Rainy conditions will occur anytime the wind strength is Gale, and might occur at other times. Rainy conditions drop visibility at sea by half. Navigation proficiency throws suffer a -2 penalty in rainy conditions. Rainy conditions have their usual effect on characters. However, characters below decks or in deckcastles or towers count as having shelter from the rain.

###### Snowy Conditions

Snowy conditions are rarely encountered at sea. If they occur, they drop visibility to 20’ and reduce the speed of vessels by half. Snowy conditions have their usual effect on characters, except those except those below decks or in deckcastles or towers count as having shelter from the snow.

###### Stormy Conditions

Stormy conditions will occur anytime the wind speed is Very Strong. Stormy conditions have their usual effect on characters, except that those below decks or in deckcastles or towers are not affected by the wind.

###### Windy Conditions

Windy conditions will occur anytime the wind speed is Very Strong. Windy conditions have their usual effect on characters, except that those below decks or in deckcastles or towers are not affected by the wind.

### Casualties, Damage, Rest, and Repair at Sea

Full crews operating vessels on sea voyages do not require specific days of rest, as the crew is assumed to sail or row in rotation throughout the voyage. However, if the vessel has less than a full crew, either its speed or its duration of uninterrupted travel will be less.

* A vessel with less than a full crew of rowers reduces its rowing voyage speed in proportion to the missing crew.
* A vessel with less than a full crew but more than half crew of sailors can maintain its sailing voyage speed by day, but must reduce its sailing voyage speed by night in double proportion to the missing crew. Alternatively, it can reduce both its day and night speed in proportion to the missing crew.
* A vessel with less than a half crew of sailors must reduce its sailing voyage speed in proportion to amount of crew missing to reach half-crewed. It must reduce its sailing voyage speed by night to zero. Alternatively, it can reduce both its day and night speed in proportion to the missing crew.
* During combat a vessel will usually have one-half its sailors manning the sails (so it can maintain its full speed), while the other sailors board, repair, or shoot.

Round speed to the nearest 6-mile interval.

EXAMPLE: A longship has a crew of 15 sailors and 60 rowers. It has an oar voyage speed of 30 miles per day and a sail voyage speed of 90 miles per day. In a battle, 5 sailors and 20 rowers are slain. The longship’s oar voyage speed is reduced to [(60-20)/60 x 30] = 20 miles per day. The longship’s sail voyage speed is still 90 miles per day, but if it sails at night, speed is reduced to [(15-5)/15 x 1/2 x 90] = 30 miles per day. Alternatively, the longship could just sail [(10/15) x 90] = 60 miles per day and night.

Damage to a vessel also reduce its voyage speed in proportion to the percentage of its shp lost, rounded to the nearest 6-mile interval. If a vessel is reduced to 0 or less shp, it cannot move under its own power. It will sink after 1d10 turns.

Missing crew and vessel damage also reduce combat speed by the same ratio that they reduce voyage speed, rounded to the nearest 30’ interval. Whether moving at combat or voyage speed, reduction in speed from crew loss and vessel damage are not cumulative — use whichever speed reduction is worse, casualties or damage.

Structural hit points cannot be healed, but they can be repaired. When a vessel is damaged, it takes five crew members one turn to repair each point of structural damage. They cannot take any other action while they are repairing the vessel. The crew can only repair half of any damage sustained while at sea; the remaining damage can only be fixed by using facilities at a dock.

## Sea Encounters

Sea encounters can confront the adventurers with privateers, pirates, foreign navies, aerial attackers, or — most dreaded of all —a sea monster.

### Encounter Distance

Encounters at sea always begin at maximum visibility distance. The direction from which the opponents approach each other will be determined by the Judge based on the wind and destination of the vessels. The direction from which creatures approach vessels is left to the Judge’s discretion, but will usually come from the front (i.e. in the vessel’s way). The Judge will begin sea combat when the range is 1,800’ or less. Because of the great range at which sea encounters between vessels start, many turns or even hours might pass before the vessels engage in combat.

### Evasion at Sea

Vessels cannot evade sea creatures, so the Judge will proceed directly to combat. Vessels can evade other vessels at sea if:

* It can travel fast and far enough to increase the distance between itself and its pursuer to greater than the maximum encounter distance (usually visibility distance).
* It can travel for just long enough for the maximum encounter distance to decrease (e.g. due to sun set) to less than the range between itself and its pursuer.
* It can travel into a fog bank, storm, or other weather condition that reduces the maximum encounter distance to less than the range between itself and its pursuer.
* It can travel into water that is too shallow for its pursuer to follow due to deeper draft.
* It can travel to an archipelago or coastline that affords hidden coves and beaches where it can conceal itself.

Because line of sight is so long, and distance so vast, vessel speed is paramount. It is virtually impossible for a slower vessel to reliably evade a faster one. In most cases, the faster vessel will eventually catch the slower vessel — it’s simply as a matter of sailing time.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Sea Pursuit Time** | |
| **Evading vessel is** | **Time to Catch** |
| Faster than pursuer | Cannot be caught |
| 0’ – 30’/round slower | 1d6+2 hours |
| 31’ –60’/round slower | 1d3+1 hours |
| 61’ – 90’/round slower | 1d3 hours |
| 91’ – 120’/round slower | 2d6+1 turns |
| 121’ – 150’/ round slower | 2d6-1 turns |

However, random events such as shifting ocean currents, sudden changes in wind direction, rogue waves, hidden reefs or shoals, and similar circumstances can modify the pursuit time, sometimes by enough to make evasion possible. The Sea Pursuit Time table can be used to randomly determine the time required for a pursuing vessel to close on an evading target. The table assumes the initial range is 6 miles; if less, reduce time proportionately. When comparing the vessel’s speed, be sure to account for wind direction and strength as well as a master mariner’s ability to sail faster against the wind (if one is on board).

Some vessels are much faster under oar than under sail, and adventurers might wish to escape under oar. Oar sprint speed can only be maintained for 10 rounds (1 turn) and oar cruise speed can only be maintained for 18 turns (3 hours). In most cases, the rowers will become winded before the vessel escapes. However, if the evading vessel is close to a safe harbor, or conditions limit visibility, or if the encounter occurs in the late afternoon just before sunset, then oar speed might be usable for long enough to make good an escape.

## Sea Combat

When hostile vessels or monsters move within 900’ of each other, a **sea combat** occurs.

### Simulating Sea Combat on the Battlemap

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Vessel | Length | Width | Hexes |
| Galley, 1-Rower | 65’ | 13’ | 1 |
| Galley, 1.5-Rower | 80’ | 14’ | 1 |
| Galley, 2-Rower | 90’ | 14’ | 1 |
| Galley, 2.5-Rower | 115’ | 19’ | 2 |
| Galley, 3-Rower | 130’ | 18.5’ | 2 |
| Galley, 4-Rower | 140’ | 18.5’ | 2 |
| Galley, 5-Rower | 150’ | 18.5’ | 3 |
| Galley, 6-Rower | 155’ | 25’ | 3 |
| Galley, 8-Rower | 320’ | 25’ | 5 |
| Longship | 100’ | 12.5’ | 2 |
| Sailing Ship, Small | 75’ | 25’ | 1 |
| Sailing Ship, Large | 100’ | 25’ | 2 |
| Sailing Ship, Huge | 115’ | 30’ | 2 |

While battles at sea can be resolved using the theater of the mind, they are better resolved by using a set of battlemaps (analog or virtual) with counters, figures, or tokens to represent the exact position of the vessels and combatants throughout the combat.

One battlemap is the **sea battlemap** used to represent the area where the naval battle is being fought. The sea battlemap should be divided into hexagons at the scale of 1 hex = 60’. The sea battlemap should be around 30 hexes long and wide.

The other battlemaps are the **deck battlemaps** of the vessels participating in the naval battle. The deck battlemaps should be divided into squares at the scale of 1 hex = 5’. A typical vessel is about 100’ to 150’ long and 10’ to 30’ wide, so a deck battlemap that is 30 squares x 30 squares can actually be used to illustrate several vessels, or one vessel and an area of sea around it, etc.

For players whose characters are captaining vessels, sea combat plays like a board wargame divided into one-minute rounds. Each vessel occupies one or more hexes on the battlemap, depending on its length, and moves 1 or more hexes on the captain’s initiative each round. The players controlling the captains control their vessels’ movements on the hex map and handle any ramming attacks the vessels make.

For the other players, sea combat plays like a traditional ***ACKS***combat and the ships function as essentially “moving terrain.” Characters and non-player characters can operate war machines, cast spells, and exchange missile fire, and when vessels get close enough, engage in boarding actions. Artillery fire, missile attacks, and long-range spellcasting are adjudicated using the sea battlemap. Boarding actions, when they occur, are fought on the deck battlemap for the vessels involved.

**Designer’s Note:** Gamers familiar with the ***Battlestations*** board game or ***FTL*** videogame might recognize the approach in these rules, where both a “zoomed-in” deck plan and a “zoomed out” battlefield map are used simultaneously. The same technique could be used by the Judge to simulate slow-moving kaiju crawling across a battlemap or aerial battles between flying castles and so on.

###### Stacking on the Sea Battlemap

Vessels and monsters occupy one or more hexes, depending on their length. Allied vessels cannot occupy the same hexes unless they are both stationary or lashed together or accidentally collide. Allied and enemy vessels can occupy the same hexes due to boarding actions, collisions, and/or ramming. Monsters can occupy the same hexes as vessels or other monsters. Aerial vehicles and monsters can occupy the same hexes as any waterborne vehicle or monster.

### Round Sequence

###### Pre-Initiative Declarations.

During Pre-Initiative Declarations, captains must re-calculate their vessel’s maximum speeds (oar sprint, oar cruise, oar slow, or sail) if they suffered any damage in the prior round. Each captain must decide and publicly inform the Judge before the initiative dice are rolled of the following:

* The vessel is raising or lowering sails in order to switch from oar to sail or vice versa.
* The vessel is changing speed. Oar speed can be set at any value up to oar sprint speed. Sail speed can be set at any value up to sail speed (modified by wind direction and strength). If a vessel lost crew or shp such that its speed on the prior round now exceeds its maximum speed, the vessel must reduce speed to at or below that maximum.
* The vessel is backwatering.

The captain, or other character steering the vessel, must also publicly inform the Judge whether they are using a full-round action to do so. Using a full-round action means that the captain will not be able to take any other movement or combat actions during the round, but enables him to steer the vessel throughout the entire round (see below).

###### Initiative Rolls

Ships do not have initiative scores. Instead they move throughout the round. Vessel captains, artillery crews, individual characters, and groups of marines or other NPCs each roll initiative separately.

### Movement During Sea Combat

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Vessel**  **Combat Speed** | **Hexes Moved** |
| 480\* | 8 |
| 450’\* | 7.5 |
| 420’\* | 7 |
| 390’\* | 6.5 |
| 360’ | 6 |
| 330’ | 5.5 |
| 300’ | 5 |
| 270’ | 4.5 |
| 240’ | 4 |
| 210’ | 3.5 |
| 180’ | 3 |
| 150’ | 2.5 |
| 120’ | 2 |
| 90’ | 1.5 |
| 60’ | 1 |
| 30’ | 0.5 |
| \*Only possible for 1.5-rower, 2-rower, and 2.5-rower galleys running in front of a strong wind. | |

As the Judge counts through the initiative numbers, vessels move across the battlefield on their captain’s initiative segment. Vessels move before characters or monsters on the same count. If both sides of the combat have vessels, whichever side has fewer vessels on that count can choose to move its vessels first or have the opposing side move its vessels first. The vessels on a side can go in any order they choose. Moving is not optional; the vessel must move at whatever speed its captain set before initiative was rolled. The Sea Combat Movement shows how many 60’ hexes a vessel moves based on its combat speed. Round speeds between rows to the nearest 30’.

EXAMPLE: Phaedra is commanding a 5-rower galley under oar rowing at sprint speed (240’). On Phaedra’s initiative count, her galley moves 4 hexes.

Sometimes a vessel’s speed include a half-hex. In this case, round the speed up if the captain rolled a natural 4 or higher on his initiative, and round it down if the captain rolled a natural 3 or less on his initiative. A captain who wishes to avoid such uncertainty can, of course, simply declare before initiative that the vessel will move at a slower rate.

EXAMPLE: Phaedra is commanding a 3-rower galley under oar at sprint speed (330’). If Phaedra rolls a 1-3 on her initiative, her galley moves 5 hexes on her count; if she rolls a 4-6, it moves 6 hexes. If Phaedra were certain she didn’t want to move 6 hexes, she could have just set her speed at 300’ and moved 5 hexes.

###### Oared Movement

A vessel moving at oar (cruise) speed can move straight ahead or turn into one of the hexes to either side of its bow. The following rules apply to turning:

* A one-hex vessel can make one turn per hex of movement. A two hex-vessel can make one turn per two hexes of movement (i.e. it must move straight ahead at least once between each turn). A three-hex vessel can make one turn per three hexes of movement, a four-hex vessel can make one turn per four hexes of movement, and so on.
* When a one-hex-long vessel turns, the vessel’s bow is turned to point in the direction it moved.
* When a two-hex-long vessel turns, the vessel’s bow is turned to point in the direction moved, while the vessel’s stern hex is moved to occupy the hex originally occupied by the bow.
* When a three-hex-long vessel (or longer) moves, the vessel’s bow is turned to the point in the direction it moved, the vessel’s middle hex is moved to occupy the hex originally occupied by the bow, and the vessel’s rear hex(es) are placed behind. This can trigger a collision (p. XX).

![](data:image/png;base64...)

###### Oar Sprinting

Rowers can only maintain a vessel at its oar sprint speed for a total of 10 rounds (1 turn) before becoming **winded.** Winded rowers cannot exceed oar cruise speed until the condition ends (which requires 1 turn of complete rest).

###### Backwatering

A vessel that is backwatering can move in reverse at one-third its oar cruise speed. When backwatering, the vessel can move straight back or turn into one of the hexes to either side of its stern. Vessels under sail cannot backwater. A vessel that is backwatering can halt at any point in the initiative count and does not need to continue moving.

###### Raising and Lowering Sails

A vessel that is raising or lowering sails does not move unless it is a 1.5-rower or 2.5-rower galley. 1.5- and 2.5-rower galleys can move at their oar cruise speed if raising sails or their sail speed if lowering sails. It takes three sailors (characters with Seafaring) to raise or lower sails on a 1.5-rower galley and five sailors on a 2.5-rower galley. It requires the entire crew of sailors, less captain and navigator, to raise or lower sails on other vessels.

###### Sailing Movement

A vessel under sail uses its sail speed. However, a vessel under sail must modify its sail speed based on wind strength and wind direction relative to the vessel at the start of the round. If a vessel starts the round facing into the wind, it cannot move at all that round but it can shift its bow into either adjacent hex on the captain’s initiative. A vessel under sail that turns directly into the wind immediately halts and moves no further that round.

EXAMPLE: Phaedra is commanding a 4-rower galley under sail. The galley has a sail movement of 180’. However, it is facing northwest against northerly winds, making it close-hauled. A close-hauled vessel moves at 2/3 speed, so Phaedra’s galley can only move 120’. Consulting the Sea Combat movement table, Phaedra sees that her vessel will move 2 hexes. Phaedra can move straight ahead or turn left (west) without issue, but if Phaedra turns her vessel north, it immediately halts.

###### Monster and Character Movement

Creatures complete their full movement (if any) when they take their actions on their initiative count. Aerial creatures in the sky and aquatic creatures in the open sea can move at three times their standard combat and running speed (as in wilderness), rounded to the nearest 30’. Fractional hexes are handled with the same mechanic as vessels (q.v.).

EXAMPLE: At the start of the round, a sea monster has appeared 240’ (5 hexes) from Phaedra’s vessel. The monster’s swimming speed is 30’ / 90’. On open ocean, it can “charge” 270’, or 4.5 hexes. The sea monster rolls a 4 for initiative. Since it rolled an unmodified 4, it can move up to 5 hexes. On count 4, it moves adjacent to Phaedra’s vessel’s stern starboard hex.

Creatures on vessels move at their standard combat speed and running speed. This simulates the difficult of moving across wet, slippery, and shifting decks.

EXAMPLE: Norden is a dwarven vaultguard with a charging/running speed of 90’ and combat speed of 30’ who is master of arms on Phaedra’s war galley. Phaedra’s war galley is 150’ long. Norden s amidship, just below the mast. His initiative roll was a 7 but he has delayed his initiative. After the sea monster reaches the vessel and attacks, Norden decides to take his initiative segment. He is 75’ from the sea monster, so she decides to charge.

### Naval Tactics

During sea combat, vessels can deploy a number of naval tactics such as artillery barrages, boarding actions, and rams. These tactics are further explained in the following sections.

###### Artillery

Some vessels carry one or more artillery pieces. A vessel’s captain can designate targets on his initiative as an action in lieu of moving, but each artillery piece fires on its own initiative segment rolled by its crew. Artillery pieces crewed by adventurers do not have to obey the captain’s orders. The arc of fire available to vessel-mounted artillery depends on where they are located on the vessel. Bow-mounted artillery can fire at targets in a 60-degree arc in front of the vessel. Stern-mounted artillery can fire at targets in a 60-degree arc behind the vessel. Artillery mounted port amidships can fire at targets in a 120-degree arc left of the vessel, while artillery mounted starboard amidships can fire at targets in a 120-degree arc right of the vessel.

![](data:image/png;base64...)

Actual artillery fire is handled as per the rules for missile attacks with artillery (p. XX). Catapults are not penalized when firing on vessels based on their movement, but they are penalized when firing on moving monsters. Remember that light and medium ballista deal 1/10 damage to vessels. Heavy ballista and light catapults deal 1/3 damage to vessels. All other artillery deal full damage to vessels. If combustible pitch is used, see **Fire Pot Poles and Pitch**, below.

Characters atop towers and rowing on aphract vessels gain a +4 bonus to AC and a +4 bonus to their Blast saving throws vs. artillery. Characters inside towers or rowing on cataphract vessels cannot be damaged by artillery unless the ship has lost at least 25% of its shp, in which case they are targeted as if in arrow loops: +4 bonus to AC, +4 bonus to Blast saving throws, and no damage on a successful save.

Submerged aquatic monsters gain a +4 bonus to AC vs. artillery and take only half damage from direct hits. They cannot be harmed by splash damage at all while submerged.

###### Attaching Grappling Lines

When a vessel is adjacent to or in the same hex as another vessel, one or more of its crew can use a combat action to secure a grapple line. Securing a grappling line requires an attack throw vs. the enemy vessel’s AC. The attack throw suffers a -2 penalty if the vessels share a hex and a -5 penalty if the vessels are merely adjacent. As long as the two vessels are grappled together, the vessels cannot increase the number of hexes between them. If the lighter vessel attempts to do so, it simply stays in place. If the heavier vessel attempts to do so, it moves but the lighter vessel moves with it.

A character can attempt to cut or dislodge a grapple line as a combat action. Cutting a grapple line requires a successful attack throw vs. AC 0 that deals at least 5 slashing damage. Dislodging a grapple line requires a successful Dungeonbashing throw.

###### Boarding by Boarding Bridge

A boarding bridge is a war machine positioned on a vessels’ bow operated by one character. When the vessel’s bow hex is adjacent to or in a hex of an enemy vessel, the operator can use a combat action to lower the bridge. (Usually the operator will ready an action to lower the bridge as soon as an enemy vessel is adjacent to the bow.) When the bridge is lowered, the character operating the boarding bridge must make an attack throw against the enemy vessel’s AC.

If the attack throw succeeds, the bridge is securely fastened to the enemy vessel. Both vessels have their speed reduced to 0 and cannot move until the bridge is raised. Once the bridge is lowered, up to 30 man-sized characters (one infantry platoon) can cross it on their initiative. If more than 30 attempt to cross in one round, the extra characters must end their movement on the bridge.

If the throw fails, the bridge is not fastened securely. Both vessels retain their speed and continue to move. Characters that charge or run across the unsecured bridge must make successful Paralysis saving throws or fall overboard.

In either case, characters on the enemy vessel who are underneath the falling bridge must make Blast saving throws. If the save succeeds, the character avoids the falling bridge. If the save fails, the character takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone next to the bridge.

Raising the boarding bridge also requires a combat action. If the bridge is securely fastened to the enemy vessel, the operator must make a Dungeonbashing proficiency throw. There is a -4 penalty per character currently standing on the bridge. If the throw succeeds, the bridge is raised. If the throw fails, the bridge remains fastened to the deck.

Characters on the enemy vessel cannot raise the bridge if it is secured, but can attempt to dislodge it if unsecured. Dislodging the bridge is a combat action that requires a Dungeonbashing proficiency throw. There is a +4 bonus per additional character assisting in the effort and a -4 penalty per character currently standing on the bridge. If the throw succeeds, the bridge is dislodged.

When a boarding bridge is raised or dislodged, any characters on board must make Paralysis saving throws. If the save fails, the character fails overboard. If the save succeeds, the character safely leaps to his choice of vessel.

###### Boarding by Boarding Ramp

A boarding ramp is a portable war machine weighing 40 st carried by a crew of two man-sized characters. When a vessel is adjacent to or in a hex of an enemy vessel, the crew can use a combat action to attempt to place the ramp across the gap between the two vessels. The crewmember closest to the enemy vessel must make an attack throw against the enemy vessel’s AC. If the throw fails, the boarding ramp isn’t placed successfully. Both vessels retain their speed and continue to move.

If the throw succeeds, the ramp is successfully placed on the enemy vessel. Both vessels retain their speed and continue to move. Up to 8 man-sized characters can cross the ramp on their initiative thereafter. If more than 8 attempt to cross in one round, the extra characters must end their movement on the ramp. Characters that charge or run across the ramp must make successful Paralysis saving throws or fall overboard.

Characters on the enemy vessel can attempt to dislodge a boarding ramp. Dislodging a ramp is a combat action that requires a Dungeonbashing proficiency throw at +4. There is an additional +4 bonus per additional character assisting in the effort and a -4 penalty per character currently standing on the ramp. If the throw succeeds, the ramp is dislodged. Characters on the ramp when it is dislodged must make Paralysis saving throws or fall overboard (as above). If either of the vessels move, the boarding ramp is automatically dislodged.

###### Boarding by Jumping

Anytime a vessel is adjacent to or in a hex of an enemy vessel, a character on one vessel can attempt to jump onto the other. If the vessels are adjacent and moving, the character must make a 30’ jump. If the vessels are adjacent and stationary, the character must make a 15’ jump. If the vessels share one or more hexes, the character must make a 10’ jump.

As per the rules in the **Adventuring** chapter, the maximum distance in feet that a character can jump horizontally is equal to his DEX score + 1d6. A character proficient in Acrobatics can add his class level to his DEX score, to a maximum of 24. In addition, a character jumping from a larger onto a smaller vessel gains a +4 bonus to his DEX score due to the height advantage, to a maximum of 28. The distance jumped is reduced by 1’ per stone of encumbrance the character is carrying. A character must have a moving start of at least 20’ or halve his jumping distance. The distance jumped counts against the character’s movement during the round.

The character must make a Paralysis saving throw when he lands. Adventurers proficient in Acrobatics gain a +2 bonus to the save. If the save succeeds, the character successfully lands the jump. If the save fails, the adventurer lands short by 1d6 feet. If this puts him on the other vessel, he falls prone. If this puts him exactly at the edge of the vessel’s hull, then he ends his round hanging by his fingers and must climb or be pulled up. If this lands him over the water, he falls into the water.

###### Falling Overboard

A non-player character who falls overboard can be assumed to die in 1d10 rounds. A player character who falls overboard must make a Swimming throw at the start of his initiative each round. The target value for the Swimming throw is equal to the adventurer’s encumbrance in stone. If the weather is Windy there is a -2 penalty, if Stormy a -4 penalty. If the character has the Swimming proficiency, he gains a +4 bonus. If the throw succeeds, the character stays afloat and can use swimming movement. Swimming movement can be based on either the combatant’s combat or running speed, in either case being one-quarter the normal rate. A swimming combatant using combat movement may attack after his movement. A swimming combatant using running movement cannot attack, and is subject to becoming **winded** as per the running rules (p. XX).

If the throw fails, the character is **drowning**. A spellcaster that begins drowning loses any spell he was attempting to cast that round. A drowning character is **vulnerable,** cannot take any actions, and no longer make swimming throws. The character sinks 10’ per round per stone of encumbrance at the start of his initiative. The condition ends if an allied creature who is not drowning grabs it (requiring an action in lieu of moving) and carries it to the surface of the water. The drowning character imposes one-half his weight in encumbrance (usually 7 3/6 stone plus half of any equipment encumbrance). If the condition has not ended after 5 rounds, the drowning character dies at the end of his initiative.

A character who swims to a vessel can attempt to climb on board. If a ladder or rope is lowered, this is an easy climb (p. XX) but if not it is a climb up a sheer surface (p. XX).

###### Fire Pot Poles and Pitch

A fire pot pole is a war machine positioned on a vessel’s bow operated by one character. When the vessel’s bow hex is adjacent to or in a hex of an enemy vessel, the operator of the fire pot pole can use a combat action to dump the contents of the pots on to the enemy vessel.

The fire pots creates a 15’ diameter puddle of burning pitch. On the initiative count that the pots are dumped, the vessel immediately takes 4d6 structural fire damage and is set aflame. Each character in the area of effect must make a Blast saving throw. If the save fails, the character takes 4d6 fire damage. If the save succeeds, the character suffers half that damage.

Some artillery can also fire burning pitch. Damage ranges from 3d6 to 5d6 in a 15’ diameter. A vessel that is directly hit or splashed by burning pitch immediately takes structural fire damage and is set aflame. A character in the pitch’s area of effect must make a Blast saving throw. If the save fails, the character takes fire damage. If the save succeeds, the character suffers half that damage.

Each round thereafter, on the same initiative count, pitch (whether delivered by fire pot or artillery) continues to deal its structural fire damage to the vessel and its fire damage to characters in the area of effect (half that on a successful save). A character in or within 5’ of the area of effect can fight the fire as a full-round action. When a total of 15 full-round actions have been spent fighting the fire (e.g. 5 characters spending 3 full-round actions each), the fire is extinguished.

If a vessel is set aflame by multiple artillery pieces or fire pots, each fire must be extinguished separately.

###### Firing and Winching a Heavy Harpoon Ballista

A heavy harpoon ballista is an artillery piece that can be mounted on a vessel in order to fire grapnel darts at enemy vessels. If the crew of a heavy harpoon ballista scores a direct hit at an enemy vessel, the grapnel is securely latched onto it. Thereafter, the crew can begin to crank the winch to bring the two vessels closer together.

Cranking a heavy harpoon ballista’s winch requires a full round action by its crew. Each time the ballista’s winch is cranked, the lighter vessel is moved one hex closer to the heavier vessel. If the vessels weigh the same, roll 1d2 to decide which moves each time the winch is cranked. The vessel’s facing is not changed by the movement.

As long as the two vessels are grappled together, the vessels cannot increase the number of hexes between them. If the lighter vessel attempts to do so, it simply stays in place. If the heavier vessel attempts to do so, it moves but the lighter vessel moves with it.

###### Missile Attacks

|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Missile Weapon Range by Hex | Short | Med. | Long | Double Long |
| Arbalest | 0 – 2 | 3 – 4 | 5 – 8 | 9 – 16 |
| Crossbow | 0 – 2 | 3 – 4 | 5 – 7 | 8 – 14 |
| Composite Bow | 0 – 2 | 3 – 4 | 5 – 6 | 7 – 12 |
| Javelin/Spear | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 – 4 |
| Long Bow | 0 – 2 | 3 – 4 | 5 – 6 | 7 – 12 |
| Short Bow | 0 – 2 | 3 | 4 – 5 | 6 – 10 |
| Sling | 0 – 1 | 2 | 3 – 4 | 5 – 8 |
| Sling-Staff | 0 – 2 | 3 | 4 – 5 | 6 – 10 |
| Other (thrown) | 0 | 0 | 1 | 2 |

Missile-armed characters on a vessel can attack opponents on board the enemy’s vessels. The Judge will determine range based on the number of hexes between the vessels on the sea battlemap. The Missile Weapon Range by Hex table shows the hex range for all of the missile weapons in ***ACKS II****.*

To avoid range penalties, most missile attacks in sea combat are directed at the enemy’s crew as a whole rather than at particular individuals. This is the equivalent of a **Missile Attack vs. Troop Formation** (p. XX).

* The crew of a vessel with 59 or fewer sailors or marines can be targeted at long range as if it were at medium range.
* The crew of a vessel with 60 – 239 sailors and/or marines can be targeted out to long range with no penalty.
* The crew of a vessel with 240 – 959 sailors and/or marines can be targeted out to double long range with no penalty.
* The crew of a vessel with 960 sailors and/or marines can be targeted out to quadruple long range with no penalty.

Rowers do not normally count for purposes of crew size because they are below decks or sheltered by outriggers. However, if rowers have left their oars to fight, they’d count as marines.

Remember that when attacks are made against a formation, the actual target struck by the attack is determined randomly by the Judge. If there are allies **engaged** with the unit, the allies count as possible targets. The attacker cannot choose a target.

###### Ramming

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Ramming Vessel | Damage |
| Galley, 1-rower | 3d6 structural piercing |
| Galley, 1.5-rower | 4d6 structural piercing |
| Galley, 2-rower | 5d6 structure piercing |
| Galley, 2.5 rower | 7d6 structural piercing |
| Galley, 3 rower | 8d6 structural piercing |
| Galley, 4 rower | 9d6 structural piercing |
| Galley, 5 rower | 11d6 structural piercing |
| Galley, 6 rower | 12d6 structural piercing |
| Galley, 8 rower | 13d6 structural piercing |

A vessel with a naval ram can attempt to ram another vessel or monster after a movement that brings the front face of the vessel’s bow hex into any of the enemy vessel or monster’s hexes.

The captain of the ramming vessel must make an attack throw vs. the AC of the target vessel or monster. He cannot apply his STR or DEX bonus to the throw, nor any magical bonus from weapons, but can add +4 if he is a master mariner.

If the throw succeeds, the vessel or monster is dealt damage based on the size of the ramming vessel. However, damage is halved if the vessel is not moving at least oar cruise speed. The ramming vessel and the target halt for the remainder of the round. The vessel must backwater before it can resume moving ahead. If the throw fails, the ram is deflected harmlessly off the hull or hide of the target. The ramming vessel halts but the target does not. The ramming vessel does not need to backwater.

A vessel without a naval ram can attempt to ram another vessel but if it succeeds, damage is split evenly between the ramming vessel and the target vessel.

**Head-On Ramming:** If a movement brings a vessel’s bow hex straight into the front face of another vessel’s bow hex, then a head-on ram has occurred. Both captains must make attack throws. Whichever captain hits the highest AC chooses the outcome, from the following choices:

* The captain’s vessel rams the enemy vessel.
* The captain’s vessel shears off the oars of the enemy vessel. The enemy vessel takes 1d10 structural bludgeoning damage per 100 oars. For instance, a 5-rower galley with 300 oars takes 3d10 structural bludgeoning damage if its oars are sheared. Both vessels continue movement for the remainder of the round, passing through each other’s hexes. Neither vessel can ram again until it moves out of the opposing vessel’s hexes.
* The two vessels miss each other. Both vessels continue movement for the remainder of the round, as above.

**Collisions:** A collision occurs when one of a vessel’s mid- or stern hexes accidentally overlaps with one hex occupied by another vessel. When a collision occurs, both captains must make Seafaring throws of 11+ (7+ if master mariner). If eitherthrows succeed, the vessels avoid collision. If both throws fail, the vessels collide. Each vessel deals one-half ramming damage to the other vessel. (Vessels moving at less than oar cruise speed deal one-quarter damage.) A captain can choose to purposefully fail the throw. Sometimes a collision is “accidental”…

###### Steering

During combat, whichever character is steering a vessel is considered to be the vessels’ captain for purposes of initiative, ramming attack throws, and any required Seafaring proficiency checks. The captain must be located on the aft deck adjacent to the steering oars. If the captain starts the round at the steering oars and declares a full-round action to steer the vessel, he can steer it for the entire round. If the captain doesn’t start the round at the steering oars, or simply doesn’t want to commit a full-round action to doing so, he can steer through the vessel through a single hex turn as a movement action and/or combat action. If the captain is incapacitated, another character can become captain by moving to the steering oars.

EXAMPLE: At the start of the first round of combat, Phaedra is at the steering oars of her 3-hex-long galley. She takes a full-round action in order to steer it through a number of hex turns that round. She makes the vessel turn on initiative count 10 and again on initiative count 7. Her next chance to turn will come on initiative count 4. However, on initiative count 5 she is incapacitated by an enemy attack. On initiative count 4, her party member Norden uses a movement action to run to the steering oars and a combat action to steer the vessel. Normally the 3-hex-long galley would be able to turn again on initiative count 1, but since Norden didn’t commit a full-round action to steering, he can’t make the vessel turn.

In order to be steered, a vessel under oar must have its full complement of rowers, or its speed is reduced (p. XX). A vessel under sail must have at least one-half its complement of sailors or its speed is reduced in proportion to the missing crew (p. XX).

###### Traversing Grapple Lines

If two vessels are connected by a grapple line (whether by hook or harpoon), characters can cross by either zipping or crawling across them. If the character’s vessel is larger than the other vessel, the character can zip across using the rules for rappelling (p. XX). If the character’s vessel is the same size as or smaller than the other vessel, the character can crawl across using the rules for crawling traverse (p. XX).

If the vessels are adjacent and moving, the character must make a 30’ traverse. If the vessels are adjacent and stationary, the character must make a 15’ traverse. If the vessels share one or more hexes, the character must make a 10’ traverse. If the grapple line is cut or dislodged while the character is traversing it, he must make a Paralysis saving throw. If the save succeeds, he retains his grip on the rope as he falls into the water. If the save fails, he loses his grip on the rope and takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage as he hits the water.

###### Underwater Combat

From time to time, characters may accidentally or deliberately end up fighting underwater. The following effects apply:

* Maximum visibility range is reduced by half at depths of 300’ to 600’, by 75% at depths of 600’ to 1200’, by 87.5% at depths of 1,200’ to 2,500’. Below 2,500’ there is no light at all and visibility drops to 0.
* Characters making melee attacks with weapons that do not deal piercing damage suffer a -2 penalty to their attack throw.
* Characters making missile attacks have a -2 penalty to attack and damage targets at short range, a -5 penalty at medium range, and a -10 penalty at long range. If damage is reduced to 0 or less, the missile was halted by the water harmlessly.
* Characters who cannot breathe water cannot cast spells or speak command words underwater.
* Characters who attempt to use scrolls underwater simply destroy the scroll and their player suffers a -1 penalty to INT.

## River Voyages

Not every voyage involves sailing across the high seas. Sometimes the adventurers will want to engage in trade or travel along the navigable rivers of the realm. Current and depth become primary considerations for river voyages.

### River Current

The water current at the ocean surface is moved primarily by winds, but the water current of rivers is moved primarily by changes in elevation — rivers flow downward from mountains into flatlands and eventually drain into lakes or seas. Therefore, in addition to wind direction and wind strength, **river current direction** and **river current speed** affect river voyages. Rivers are also much shallower than seas, so **river depth** can become an issue.

###### River Current Direction

A vessel that is moving with the current is moving downriver, while a vessel moving against the current is moving upriver. River current direction will be determined by the Judge based on his regional and campaign maps. For instance, in the Auran Empire setting, the Ammasaurëan Sea sits in a depression between two great mountain ranges, the Jutting Mountains in the north and the Meniri Mountains in the south. Rivers with their source in the Jutting Mountains thus tend to flow south to the sea, while rivers sourced in the Meniri flow north to the sea.

###### River Current Speed

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Current Speed | Voyage Speed Modifier |
| Placid | ±6 miles (1 hex) |
| Gentle | ±12 miles (2 hexes) |
| Slow | ±18 miles (3 hexes) |
| Moderate | ±24 miles (4 hexes) |
| Swift | ±36 miles (6 hexes) |
| Rapid | ±48 miles (8 hexes) |

A vessel moving downriver gains a bonus to its voyage speed, while a vessel moving upriver suffers a penalty to its voyage speed. The magnitude of the bonus or penalty depends on whether the current speed is placid (0.5 mph), gentle (1 mph), slow (1.5 mph), moderate (2 mph), swift (3 mph), or rapid (4 mph). The voyage speed modifier applies to both sailing and rowing speed. It is applied after wind direction and wind speed modifiers. River current speed will be determined by the Judge based on his regional and campaign maps.

EXAMPLE: A barge on the Kem River is traveling north with a cargo of quarried stone downriver to the Ammasaurëan Sea. The barge has a voyage speed of 60 miles per day under sail and 36 miles per day under oar. The wind is moderate westerly, so the barge is beam reaching (1/2 sailing speed), reducing its sailing speed to just 30 miles per day. Therefore the barge is under oar to use its voyage speed of 36 miles per day. The Kem River has a moderate current, modifying voyage speed by 24 miles. Since the barge is sailing downriver, the modifier increases its voyage speed to 60 miles per day. If the barge were sailing upriver, its voyage speed would be just 12 miles per day under these conditions.

### River Depth

Rivers are also much shallower and narrower than seas, so **river** **depth** can become an issue. The depth and width of the river determines the size of the vessels that can travel and maneuver on it. Navigable rivers can range from 6’ to 500’ deep or more. The Judge will determine the depth of rivers based on his campaign and regional maps.

|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Vessel** | **Draft** |  |  | **Vessel** | **Draft** |
| Boat, Row | 6” |  |  | Galley, 4-Rower | 4’ |
| Boat, Sail | 2’ |  |  | Galley, 5-Rower | 5’ |
| Canoe | 6” |  |  | Galley, 6-Rower | 6’ |
| Galley, 1-Rower | 2’4” |  |  | Gallery, 8-Rower’ | 8’ |
| Galley, 1.5-Rower | 2’6” |  |  | Longship | 2’6” |
| Galley, 2-Rower | 2’6” |  |  | Sailing Ship, Small | 5’ |
| Galley, 2.5-Rower | 2’6” |  |  | Sailing Ship, Large | 10’ |
| Galley, 3-Rower | 3’ |  |  | Sailing Ship, Huge | 12’6” |

If the river’s depth is at least 2’ deeper than the vessel’s draft, the vessel can safely sail or row on the river. If the river’s depth is less than the vessel’s draft, then it cannot sail or row on the river at all. If the river’s depth is greater than the vessel’s draft but by less than 2’, the vessel can sail or row on the river but each river hex is treated as a sandbar/shoal nautical hazard (p. XX). However, galleys and longships do not gain a +4 bonus vs. sandbars/shoals in rivers; it’s already factored into their shallow draft.

# Chapter 8: Campaigns

If the adventurers fare well they will accumulate fame, wealth, and power over many adventures. Eventually they will seek to put a permanent mark on their world. Some may pursue spiritual leadership, creating throngs of zealous worshippers, or magical power, plumbing the depths of lost lore to learn new spells, craft mighty golems, or even become undead. Others may seek temporal power by establishing a stronghold and ruling a domain, or material riches by pursuing mercantile trade and other ventures.

## Followers and Strongholds

Upon reaching 9th level, an adventurer can begin to attract followers by buying, building, conquering, or receiving a stronghold of a minimum value (5,000gp to 15,000gp, depending on type). The type of stronghold and the number and type of followers attracted are defined by the character’s class. Some strongholds can be used to secure domains (p. XX) while others can be used to establish crime syndicates (p. XX). The Followers by Class table summarizes the different possibilities.

The character’s followers will begin arriving when the stronghold is built or, if the character already has a stronghold, when the character reaches 9th level. The exact time required for followers to arrive is listed in each class’s description.

The Judge must generate the followers that arrive to serve an adventurer. Followers consist of apprentices (always 0th level), companions (always 1st – 3rd level) and military troops (either 0th or 1st level). Apprentices and companions can be generated using the class creation rules, rolling for a pre-generated template for each follower. Roll 1d6 for each companion to determine their level. On 1-3, 1st level; on 4-5, 2nd level; on 6, 3rd. Apprentices and companions function as henchmen for all purposes (including domain vassalage) but do not take up henchmen slots.

Troops consist of a mix of types that varies by the class of the character they serve. For every platoon (30 troops) or fraction thereof, the Judge must roll on the Followers Type and Equipment by Class table to determine the arms and equipment of the arriving troops. Military followers function like mercenaries, except that they will follow the adventurer on adventurers.

Followers have better morale and loyalty than ordinary hirelings. A crusader or bladedancer’s followers are fanatically brave and zealously faithful. Their morale and loyalty scores start at +4. Crusader and bladedancer followers do not have to make loyalty rolls when suffering calamities, but still have to make morale rolls. All other classes attract followers with loyalty scores starting at +2 and morale scores based on class, level, and equipment +1.

An adventurer who attracts followers will also attract peasants to his domain, if he has established one. This is discussed in the Attracting Peasants section of the domain rules (p. XX).

## Domains and Realms

As its name suggests, the ***Adventurer Conqueror King System***expects characters to advance from wandering adventurers to great conquerors and kings. These rules explain how an adventurer can become a **ruler**.

### Acquiring the Domain

An adventurer begins the process of becoming a ruler by first acquiring an area of land, which will serve as the **territory** of the **domain**. Domains can vary considerably in territory. A very small domain will encompass a 2-square mile territory (one 1.5-mile hex on a local map). A typical domain will encompass a 32-square mile territory (one 6-mile hex on a regional map, or sixteen contiguous 1.5-mile hexes on a local map). A very large domain, fit for a king, might encompass a 500-square mile territory (one 24-mile hex on a continental map, or sixteen contiguous 6-mile hexes on a regional map). A domain’s territory is often contiguous, but it may be noncontiguous if desired. While there are no restrictions on a domain’s size or shape, large and noncontiguous domains are harder to control, as explained below.

Adventurers can acquire a domain in several ways. An adventurer might be **granted** a domain by an existing ruler (usually in exchange for completing a quest and requiring a pledge of fealty to become the ruler’s vassal). While bending the knee has its disadvantages, it can allow an adventurer to get a large domain quickly. If an adventurer wishes to buy civilized land on which to establish a domain, he will find it very expensive; an acre of good land in a civilized territory typically costs 50gp.

EXAMPLE: Marcus has brought a treacherous tribune to justice, and as a reward, the legate Ulrand Valerian grants Marcus the deceased tribune’s domain in exchange for Marcus agreeing to become his vassal. Marcus is now a ruler.

Some adventurers **conquer** their domains by defeating the prior ruler. Conquest is detailed in subsequent chapters (p. XX). Depending on the course of events, a conquered domain might be nothing more than the rubble of a sacked stronghold in a desolate countryside or it might be a rich domain with an intact stronghold and flourishing population.

EXAMPLE: Anárion has defeated the chief of Brythumbria in a pitched battle. With the chief dead and his troops captured or routed, Anárion claims the chief’s stronghold as his own and declares himself chief of Brythumbria. Anárion is now a ruler.

Finally, some adventurers **establish** their own domains in unsettled territory. This requires entering the area with other adventurers or mercenaries and driving off, killing, or pacifying any monsters that dwell there. The larger the domain, the more challenging to clear it and control it. A domain cannot be secured until all monster lairs have been dealt with.

EXAMPLE: Rigan is an explorer who wishes to rule a border fort far from the stinking cesspools called cities. He leads a band of adventurers and mercenaries into the wilderness and together they clear a 6-mile unsettled hex of monsters. Rigan claims the hex as his domain. Rigan is now a ruler. He’s not ruling over anything but empty land, but he’s a ruler.

When a domain is granted, conquered, or established, it gets classified as either a **civilized**, **borderlands**,or **outlands** domain. Existing domains acquired by grant or conquest are classified by the Judge based on the geography, history, and politics of the region. Newly established domains are classified based on their proximity to urban settlements.

* A newly-established domain is classified as civilized if all of its territory is within 48 miles of a city or large town.
* A newly established domain is classified as borderlands if all of its territory is within 72 miles of a city or large town.
* All other newly established domains, as well as all territories that are not part of any domain at all, are classified as outlands.

Domains can change their classification during play as cities rise and fall and population grows and shrinks (see p. XX). Territories that are not part of any domain at all are always classified as **unsettled**, even if they are in proximity to a city or large town!

**Designer’s Note:** In the original rules of ***ACKS****,* domains were classified as civilized, borderlands, or wilderness. This naming convention caused confusion because areas without any domains at all were also called wilderness. Outlands is the new term for thinly-settled but still wilderness territory, while unsettled is the updated term for unsettled wilderness territory.

###### Land Value

Not all land is equally valuable. Therefore we assign each 6-mile hex a **land value** in gp per peasant family per month. High land revenue means the domain is rich in farm produce, timber, furs, stone, or even minerals. Low land revenue represents barren, infertile soil with limited natural resources. Roll 3d3 per hex to determine its land value. The Judge should determine the exact reason for the land’s value (or lack thereof) based on the roll.

There are three ways an adventurer can discover the land value of a hex, either by land survey, inquiry, or settlement.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Terrain Type** | **Target Value** |
| Clear, Grass | 11+ |
| Scrub, Hills | 17+ |
| Barren, Desert | 18+ |
| Mountains, Woods | 19+ |
| Swamp, Jungle | 20+ |

**Land Survey:** A land surveyor (either an NPC hireling or an adventurer with the Land Surveying proficiency) can assess the land value of a 6-mile hex. Assessing land value counts as a dedicated activity for one day. At the end of the day, the land surveyor makes a Land Surveying proficiency throw. The target value of the proficiency throw is based on the terrain. It is easy to survey the value of arable fields and pasture, but surveying the value of forests, jungles, and mountains is considerably more time-consuming as it involves, e.g., prospecting for minerals or sampling trees. If the proficiency throw succeeds, the character correctly assesses the land value of the hex and the Judge should reveal the number. If the proficiency throw fails with an unmodified 1, the character incorrectly assesses the land value of the hex, and the Judge should roll or choose a false value to reveal. (The false value will be revealed as such when the land is settled). On any other result, the character does not yet have enough information to make or revise an assessment. Land surveying in wilderness terrain is risky. Make an encounter throw each day.

**Inquiry:** If the domain is already settled by peasant families, the ruler can simply ask the peasants to tell him the land value. The peasants are usually honest, if only for fear of being caught, but peasants working particularly rich land are sometimes inclined to minimize the value of their land to reduce taxes (Judge’s discretion). Wise rulers trust but verify with a land survey.

**Settling the Land:** If the domain is not already settled by peasant families, then the process of settlement itself will reveal the domain’s land value to its ruler. The ruler learns the actual land value of the hex when he receives his first month’s revenue. See **Attracting Peasants**, below.

**Land Value Simplified (optional):** For a simpler approach, Judges may apply the same land value to all 6-mile hexes within a single 24-mile hex, or (for maximum simplicity) treat all land values as 6. By default, ***ACKS II*** products assume land values of 6gp for most NPC domains, reserving detailed land values for PC domains.

### Securing the Domain

The adventurer must now **secure his domain** by claiming or constructing a stronghold on its territory. If there is an existing structure that’s suitable for use as a stronghold on the domain, this structure can be claimed by the adventure as his stronghold. This structure might be a castle granted with the land, or a tunnel complex cleared of its prior inhabitants in the process of securing the domain, and so on. Otherwise, the adventurer will need to construct his own stronghold to secure his new territory. See Chapter 4 p. XX – XX for rules regarding construction of strongholds.

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Minimum Stronghold Value** | | | |
| **Classification** | **Per 1.5-mi hex** | **Per 6-mi. hex** | **Per 24-mi. hex** |
| Civilized | 1,000gp | 15,000gp | 240,000gp |
| Borderlands | 1,500gp | 22,500gp | 360,000gp |
| Outlands | 2,000gp | 32,000gp | 512,000gp |

In order to secure a domain, a stronghold must meet a **minimum value**, based on the size and classification of the domain to be secured. Small domains in civilized realms can be secured with a stone home or tower, but large tracts of outlands territory can only be secured with a formidable stronghold. The Minimum Stronghold Value table shows the minimum value required to secure each 1.5-mile hex, 6-mile hex, and 24-mile hex in a domain based on its classification. If a domain has multiple strongholds, the total value of all strongholds in the domain should be counted. A stronghold of insufficient value will make the domain harder to control. See **Keeping the Peace**, below.

In most cases, the stronghold the adventurer uses to attract his followers can be the same stronghold with which he secures his domain. However, guildhouses and hideouts cannot secure domains no matter how valuable they are. An assassin, nightblade, venturer, or thief who wants to rule a domain can do so, but must claim or construct a separate stronghold to govern from. Note that it’s possible for a stronghold to have sufficient value to attract followers (15,000gp) to the ruler, but not sufficient value to secure the ruler’s domain, or vice versa.

EXAMPLE: Marcus has been granted a tribunate. The tribunate’s territory consists of two 6-mile borderlands hexes. The minimum stronghold value is therefore (22,500gp x 2) = 45,000gp. The prior tribune’s stronghold consisted of a headquarters, two barracks, and four watch towers, with a total value of 87,500gp. Since Marcus has been granted the prior tribune’s stronghold, his domain is secure.

EXAMPLE: Anárion has conquered the domain of Brythumbria from its prior chief. Brythumbria’s territory consists of one 6-mile wilderness hex, so it has a minimum stronghold value of 32,000gp. The prior chief’s stronghold had been worth 40,000gp but it was badly damaged in the conquest and is currently only worth 30,000gp. Anárion orders that 2,000gp be spent to rebuild the outer walls. Until this construction is complete, Anárion’s domain is considered insecure, which will affect his domain morale.

EXAMPLE: Rigan has established a domain by clearing its territory, a 6-mile wilderness hex, of all monsters. The domain’s minimum stronghold value is therefore 32,000gp. There is no existing structure in the territory that Rigan could claim, so Rigan must construct a 32,000gp stronghold from scratch to secure his domain.

###### Noncontiguous Domains and Strongholds

Most domains are established with contiguous territory, such that a single stronghold can easily secure the entire domain. If a domain is established in a noncontiguous area of land, then a stronghold or set of strongholds must be built that is large enough to secure all the noncontiguous hexes in between the domain’s territories. If this is not done, the stronghold will count as being of insufficient value and domain morale will suffer.

EXAMPLE: Quintus has established a new domain consisting of four 6-mile borderlands hexes. Three of the hexes are clustered contiguously, while the fourth lies a distance of 18 miles (3 6-mile hexes) away. His stronghold must be of sufficient value to secure seven 6-mile hexes — the three contiguous hexes, the noncontiguous hex, and the three hexes in between. Therefore its value must be (22,500 x 7) 157,500gp or more.

###### Littoral Domains and Navies

Just as strongholds secure the countryside, vessels can secure the sea. When a domain’s territory is adjacent to one or more 6-mile hexes of navigable water, the domain ruler can apply the gp value of his navy towards his stronghold value for purposes of securing those hexes. To count as part of a navy, a vessel must either be a galley or a longship and must have its full complement of crew (captain, navigator, sailors, rowers, and/or marines). The crew for a naval vessel can be paid for out of, and counts towards, garrison expenditure.

### Attracting Peasants

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Families Arriving with Followers** | |
| **Hex Classification** | **Arriving Peasant Families** |
| Civilized | 8d6 x 10 per 6-mile hex |
| Borderlands | 3d6 x 10 per 6-mile hex |
| Outlands | 1d4+1 x 10 per 6-mile hex |

If the adventurer has acquired an existing domain by grant or conquest, he will begin his reign with peasant families on his lands. However, if the adventurer has established a new domain, it will be unoccupied until he attracts peasants to settle there. There are a number of ways that the population of peasant families in the ruler’s domains can be increased.

###### Arrival of Followers

When a domain ruler attracts followers, the followers bring with them a number of peasant families that settle in his domain. Some of these peasant families are the friends and relatives of the followers, i.e. civilians coming to support the soldiery. Others are immigrants attracted by the promise of a fresh start under the protection of the powerful adventurer. These peasant families become permanent inhabitants of the adventurer’s domain.The number of peasant families that settle in the domain is determined on the Families Arriving with Followers table. Roll for each hex of the domain’s territory as of the moment when the followers arrive. Each peasant family is assumed to have an average of 5 peasants. Families will be of the same race as the adventurer, e.g. elven fastnesses are settled by elven peasants. The foregoing notwithstanding, followers attracted by a guildhouse or a hideout do not bring peasants with them. The point of a hideout is that it’s hidden…

EXAMPLE: When Marcus was granted his tribunate, he was only 7th level. A few years later, Marcus reaches 9th level and gains the Castle class power. Because he has a stronghold worth 15,000gp, he attracts 5d6 x 10 mercenaries and 1d6 1st – 3rd level fighters as followers. These followers arrive within 1d3 months. With the followers come a number of families keen on settling in Marcus’s domain. With two 6-mile borderlands hexes, Marcus attracts 6d6 x 10 peasant families. These families add to his current domain population.

EXAMPLE: When Anárion conquered Brythumbria, he was already 10th level. However, he hadn’t yet acquired a stronghold worth at least 15,000gp, so he hadn’t attracted followers. Now, however, he has taken his defeated foe’s 30,000gp-stronghold as his own. 1d3 months after he becomes chief of Brythumbria, Anárion attracts 5d6 x 10 mercenaries and 1d6 1st – 3rd level barbarians as followers. With the followers come a number of families seeking Anárion’s governance. Since Brythumbria’s territory is one 6-mile outlands hex, Anárion attracts 1d4+1 x 10 peasant families. These families add to his current domain population.

EXAMPLE: When Rigan completed his border fort, he was 9th level. 1d3 months after the stronghold is built, Rigan attracts 5d6 x 10 mercenaries and 1d6 1st – 3rd level explorers. With those followers come peasants seeking a new life under Rigan’s protection. Since Rigan established a domain of one 6-mile hex of outlands, he attracts 1d4+1 x 10 peasant families. These families become the first inhabitants of his new domain.

###### Immigration from Investment

A ruler can encourage immigration into his domain by making **agricultural investments** into the area. For every 1000gp spent on investments in a month, the domain will attract 1d10 new peasant families. The maximum amount that may be spent in investment per month is equal to the domain’s monthly revenue or 1000gp, whichever is greater.

EXAMPLE: When Rigan’s followers arrived, they came with 30 peasant families. In order to increase his domain’s population, Rigan spends 1,000gp each month on agricultural investments. Each month he does so, he attracts 1d10 additional peasant families.

###### Immigration from Prestige

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Population (families)** | **Increase** | **Population (Families)** | **Increase** |
| 1 – 100 | +5d20 | 301 – 400 | +3d10 |
| 101 – 200 | +5d10 | 401 – 500 | +2d10 |
| 201 – 300 | +4d10 | 500+ | +1d10 |

Adventurers can attract additional peasants to move to their domains by deeds of heroism and valor. Provided an adventurer actively adventures at least once per month and keeps his domain secure from threats, his domain’s population will grow by a random amount each month, determined by the number of families already present. Elven domains always increase in population as if they were two population categories larger (e.g. a population of 350 families grows as if it were 500+). Dwarven domains increase in population as if they were one population category larger (e.g. a population of 50 families grows if it were 101 – 200).

EXAMPLE: Brythumbria currently has a population of 210 families. Anárion rules from his chieftain’s hall for several months. Then he sets out on an adventure to slay a dragon that has been plaguing the Rornish people. While he’s away, his trusty followers keep the domain secure. Since he’s gone an adventure and kept his domain secure, he attracts an additional 4d10 peasant families. If Anárion were a dwarven ruler, he’d only have attracted 3d10 families; if he were an elven ruler, 2d10.

###### Population Growth and Shrinkage

If a ruler is fortunate, birth and immigration will naturally increase the population of a domain. If he is unlucky, fire, disease, and emigration will decrease it. Each month, a ruler makes two die rolls of 1d10! per 1,000 families in the domain (rounded up). These rolls will determine the change in his domain’s population. The first roll determines the increase in the domain’s number of peasant families, and the second roll determines the decrease in the domain’s number of peasant families.

EXAMPLE: Marcus’s tribunate has grown dramatically. It now has a population of 1,200 peasant families. He will make two die rolls of 2d10. Marcus first rolls 2d10! for increase and gets a 3 and an 8. His domain gains 11 peasant families. He then rolls 2d10! for decrease and gets a 10 and a 7. Since one of the dice rolled a “10”, he must roll that die again and add it to the total. This roll results in another 10! Marcus has to roll yet again, this time getting a 4. His total is 10+7+10+4, or 31. Marcus’s domain loses 31 peasant families. Having gained 11 and lost 31, Marcus’s domain ends up down 20 peasant families.

**Stagnant Domains (optional):** Note that if a domain ruler is not actively adventuring, does not make agricultural investments, and does not have very high domain morale, the gain and loss in population each month will tend to equalize and domain population will be flat. For faster play, the Judge may assume that population increase from birth and immigration and population decrease from death and emigration are equal in domains with a morale of 0. Instead of rolling two die rolls of 1d10 every month, the ruler only rolls dice for population change from active adventuring and from morale (q.v.)

###### Limits of Growth

The classification and territory of a domain determine its maximum population. An outlands domain cannot exceed 185 families per 6-mile hex (30 people per square mile). A borderlands domain cannot exceed 375 families per 6-mile hex (60 people per square mile). A civilized domain cannot exceed 780 families per 6-mile hex (125 people per square mile).

To increase the number of families in his domain beyond these limits, a ruler may either secure additional territory; establish an **urban settlement** with **urban families** in existing territory; or improve the domains classification from outlands to borderland or borderlands to civilized. Acquiring territory is handled as above (q.v.). Establishing urban settlements is discussed in the **Villages**, **Towns**, **and Cities** rules below. Improving domain classification follows the rules below.

**Advancing from Outlands to Borderland:** An outlands domain becomes a borderlands domain if, at the end of any month, either:

* The domain has at least 185 families, is connected by road to a small town within 24 miles, and has a morale score of +1 or better;
* The domain has a territory of at least 5 hexes populated by at least 925 families and has a morale score of +1 or better; or
* An urban settlement has been established in the domain that is within 72 miles of a friendly city or large town.

**Advancing from Borderland to Civilized:** A borderlands domain becomes a civilized domain if, at the end of any month:

* The domain has at least 375 families, is connected by road to a small town within 24 miles, and has a morale score of +1 or better;
* The domain has a territory of at least 7 hexes populated by at least 1,200 families and has a morale score of +1 or better; or
* An urban settlement has been established in the domain that is within 48 miles of a friendly city or large town.

The Judge might advance a domain’s classification for other in-game circumstances that seem to merit it (Judge’s discretion). Once a domain has improved in classification, the improvement is permanent, even if the requirements for the classification are no longer being met.

**Regress of Classification (Optional):** Domains might regress in classification at the Judge’s discretion if the circumstances merit it. For instance, if a city gradually declines in population into a small town, that would probably not be enough to reduce the nearby domains from civilized to borderlands. But if the city were sacked and destroyed by a powerful monster that now terrorizes the region, the domains around it might be justifiably reduced from civilized to borderlands. The Judge is the arbiter of such cases.

**Littoral Hexes (Optional):** Communities that can exploit the bounty of the sea can maintain higher population densities. When a domain’s territory is adjacent to one or more 6-mile hexes of fishable water, the domain can count the adjacent hexes of water as part of its territory for purposes of calculating its limits of growth.

**Alternative Farming Methods (Optional):** The limits of growth above assume the low-yield mixed-use farming methods detailed in ***The Economics of Peasant Farming***in the ***Judges Journal***. Intensive cultivation of high yield crops twice per year could yield population densities eight times higher. To emulate a particular historical setting, the Judge can adjust the limits of growth where appropriate.

### Collecting Revenue

Each month, a ruler collects revenue from each peasant family in his domain. There are four sources of revenue: land revenue, service revenue, tax revenue, and tribute. The first three types of revenue are generated by the domain’s peasant families, while the last is only generated if the ruler has one or more vassal domains (described below).

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Source** | **Monthly Revenue** |
| Land | 3 – 9gp / family |
| Services | 4gp/ family |
| Taxes | 2gp/ family |
| Tribute | Varies |

**Land:** As noted under **Securing the Domain** (above), land revenue derives from labor on the domain’s lands. It includes wheat, barley, and other grains; cheese, milk, meat, bee honey, and other animal products; and clay, stone, coal, and metals. The average domain produces 6gp of land revenue per peasant, but not all land is equally valuable. Each hex of the domain’s land revenue will have been determined with a roll of 3d3 when the domain was first secured — this value is the monthly land revenue per peasant family in that hex.

EXAMPLE: Rigan has secured a 6-mile hex domain in the forest across the Mirmen River. The Judge rolls 3d3 to determine what his land revenue will be. His results were 3, 2, 3, for a total of 8. Each peasant family that settles there will generate 8gp of land revenue per month. The Judge determines the land is so valuable because of an abundance of timber and fur.

**Services:** Services revenue derives from the services of skilled tradesmen, such as baking, carpentry, lumbering, milling, and smithing. Most of these services are provided by freemen who offer a portion of their labor to the ruler in exchange for the right to practice their trade on his domain. Monthly service revenue is 4gp per family.

**Tax:** Tax revenue is coin paid directly to the ruler by his peasants. The ruler of a domain has the right to collect fees upon marriage, inheritance, birth and death, harvest, and other occasions; to levy fines and fees for administering justice; to charge tolls for the roads; to charge a duty on merchants in his markets; and to levy a rent and tax on those working the land. The sum of these constitutes the domain’s monthly tax revenue of 2gp per family. Tax revenue can be increased above this amount but doing so damages the peasants’ loyalty. Lower taxes, on the other hand, can improve the domain’s morale.

**Tribute:** Tribute is revenue received from vassal domains controlled by the ruler but managed on his behalf by henchmen. Tribute varies based on the rank and realm of the vassal. See **Establishing the Realm**,below.

###### Improving Land

As a 25,000gp construction project, a ruler may improve the land value of a 6-mile hex by 1gp. Land value may never be increased by more than 3gp and never to more than 9gp. However, land improvements are very fragile. If a domain has land improvements, their value is reduced by 1gp per 1gp plundered from the domain during pillaging (see **Maneuvers**for details on looting and pillaging.) During a siege, land improvements can be destroyed by bombardment as wooden structures — multiply shp dealt by 8 to calculate loss of gp value.

### Paying Expenses

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Source** | **Monthly Expense** |
| Garrison | 2gp / family |
| Liturgies | 1gp / family |
| Mainten. | 1gp / family |
| Tithes | 1gp / family |
| Tribute | Varies |

After collecting revenue, a ruler must pay certain expenses in order to maintain his domain.

**Garrison:** In order to maintain the security of his domain, a ruler must expend 2gp per peasant family per month on a garrison of troops. The ruler should specify the exact make-up of the garrison, hiring an appropriate number of mercenaries or conscripting troops. The **Armies** chapter (p. XX) has more details. Certain special rules apply:

* The gold piece value of a trained and equipped militia can also be applied against the garrison cost of a domain, even if the militia is not called up. Dwarven vaults and elven fastnesses automatically have trained and equipped militia worth 2gp per family. (See p. XXfor details on training and equipping militia and p. XX for vaults and fastnesses.)
* The gold piece value of scutage paid to a ruler’s lord as a Duty (see below) can be applied against the garrison cost of the domain.
* The gold piece value of troops provided by a ruler’s lord as a Favor (see below) can sometimes be applied against the garrison cost of the domain. If the ruler is paying scutage, then the value of troops supplied in excess of his scutage can be applied. If the ruler has called up troops, then the value of troops provided is reduced by the value of troops supplied.

Garrison cost cannot be paid with expenditure on henchman, mercenary officers, specialists, or any other hireling except actual troops.

The garrison cost above is a minimum expenditure. A ruler may spend more on his garrison if desired. Rulers of realms subject to frequent invasion often maintain large garrisons to avoid morale problems. Borderland domains often maintain garrisons of 3gp per family and outlands domains must maintain garrisons of 4gp per family or base morale will be reduced. See **Keeping the Peace**, below.

**Liturgies:** A ruler will be expected to pay for ceremonial games, sporting events, religious feasts, country festivals, and public works that please and impress the domain’s peasant families. The cost of liturgies is 1gp per peasant family. If this tradition is not honored, the loyalty of the population to the ruler will be reduced.

**Maintenance:** A ruler must pay 1gp per peasant family to maintain his domain’s stronghold. Failure to pay maintenance reduces the stronghold value of the domain (by 1gp per gp of unpaid maintenance), which can reduce the domain’s base morale score and make it harder to control.

**Tithes:** A ruler must pay a tithe of 1gp per peasant family to the church of the domain’s dominant religion. If the domain ruler is a bladedancer or crusader, the domain’s dominant religion is the ruler’s. Otherwise, the domain’s dominant religion is the prevailing religion of the region (Judge’s discretion). If the tithe is not paid, the loyalty of the population to the ruler will be reduced, and the ruler may be declared a heretic or excommunicated by the church. The domain ruler may change the domain’s religion but doing so causes substantial penalties to domain morale. See **Keeping the Peace**, below.

Note that even a domain ruled by a bladedancer or crusader must pay tithes. Churches and temples in ***ACKS*** are assumed to generate revenue from both owning land and from receiving tithes. The individual abbot, bishop, or other ecclesiastic ruler of each domain will receive and spend the land revenue, while the overall head of the religion will control the funds from tithes.

**Tribute:** If a ruler holds a domain within the realm of a superior lord, he will have to pay a tribute to his liege. A ruler who fails to pay tribute risks retribution from his lord. See **Establishing the Realm**, below.

###### Magistrates

The domain ruler doesn’t personally count the tithes to the temple or oversee the workmen on the castle. He has various NPC magistrates who handle such matters for him. The cost of these magistrates is subsumed into the domain expense total. If desired, however, the domain ruler can appoint specific qualifying PCs or NPCs as his magistrates**.** There are four types of magistrates, each with its own qualification requirements.

* **Captain of the Guard:** The captain of the guard oversees the domain’s garrison expenditure. The captain of the guard must have both Command and Manual of Arms proficiencies.
* **Chaplain:** The chaplain oversees het domain’s tithe expenditure. The chaplain must have the ability to cast divine magic and at least one rank of Theology proficiency.
* **Munerator**: The munerator oversees the domain’s liturgies expenditure. The munerator must have Diplomacy proficiency and at least one rank in a Performance proficiency.
* **Steward:** The steward oversees the domain’s maintenance expenditure. The steward must have Bargaining proficiency and at least one rank in a Craft or Profession proficiency.

Each month, the magistrate keeps 12.5% of the domain expense he oversees as his salary for his services. This salary does not increase the ruler’s domain expenses or decrease the funds available to pay his troops. It’s abstractly paid out of his domain expenses. The salary does count as domain income for the magistrate and grants campaign XP to the extent it exceeds the magistrate’s GP threshold (see p. XX).

Magistrates are usually either fellow adventurers, followers, or henchmen of the ruler. Non-henchman magistrates might be susceptible to corruption or treachery (Judge’s discretion).

**Designer’s Note:** These magistrate rules work best when the players are collaborating to run a single domain, as one can serve as ruler and the others can serve as magistrates. Some players aren’t interested in running a domain but would still like to earn XP from campaign activities.

### Earning Domain Income

Domain income is the difference between domain revenue and domain expenses. For independent realms, domain income calculations are easily calculated on a per-family basis. Domains that are part of a larger realm will have tribute revenue and costs as well. Domain income can give an adventurer campaign XP (p. XX).

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Domain** | **Revenue per Family** | **Costs per Family** | **Income per Family** |
| Outlands | Land (3-9gp) + Service (4gp) + Tax (2gp) | Garrison (4gp) + Liturgies (1gp) + Tithes (1gp) + Maint. (1gp) | ~ 5gp |
| Borderlands | Land (3-9gp) + Service (4gp) + Tax (2gp) | Garrison (3gp) + Liturgies (1gp) + Tithes (1gp) + Maint. (1gp) | ~ 6gp |
| Civilized | Land (3-9gp) + Service (4gp) + Tax (2gp) | Garrison (2gp) + Liturgies (1gp) + Tithes (1gp) + Maint. (1gp) | ~ 7gp |

Note that if the ruler of a borderlands or outlands domain spends only the minimum 2gp per family on its garrison then its income per family is the same as a civilized domain, but its base morale will be reduced.

### Establishing the Realm

Through conquest, expansion, or politics, a ruler may find himself in control of a domain that is too large to safely control. At any time, a ruler may divide the territory of an existing domain into one or more smaller domains, each with its own territory and families. A ruler may also establish new domains by acquiring land and constructing strongholds, or conquer a new domain, or be granted a new domain in a treaty. However the situation comes about, a group of domains under the control of one ruler are collectively called a **realm**.However, a ruler can only directly rule one domain, known as his **personal domain**. Other domains in the realm are considered **vassal domains**, and must be assigned to a henchman, called a **vassal**, to rule.

Since the number of henchmen any character may employ is limited to between 1 and 7 (depending on his Charisma), rulers may end up with more territory under their control than can be managed even by assigning one domain to each of their henchmen. In this case, multiple vassal domains can be assigned to trusted henchmen, who then themselves have to sub-assign vassal domains to their own henchmen. A group of domains ruled by a vassal is called a **vassal realm**.A ruler may himself be a sub-vassal to another ruler that he has sworn fealty to (usually the lord who granted him the land to build his domain).

EXAMPLE: Quintus rules a realm of thirteen domains. He has six henchmen. He manages one domain directly, and assigns two vassal domains to each of his six henchmen. Each of his six henchmen thus has a vassal realm of two domains. Each manages one of their domains directly, and sub-assigns the other as a vassal domain to his own henchman.

###### Titles of Nobility

Adventurers and other domain rulers may claim a title of nobility or be awarded one by their lord. If the adventurer secures his domain within an existing realm, his title will be awarded based on the heraldry of that realm. The more domains the adventurer controls (including assigned and sub-assigned vassal domains), the higher the title he will hold. An adventurer who establishes a new realm can claim any title he wishes, of course, but other realms will not necessarily treat him as such. A domain ruler may award titles below his own to his own vassals.

Three factors determine a ruler’s title — the size of his personal domain, the number of vassal domains he has, and the overall size of the realm he rules. The Titles of Nobility table shows the common titles of nobility used based on these criteria. A common title is provided for each tier, plus titles used by cultures within the Auran Empire campaign setting.

###### Tribute

Each month, a ruler will **collect tribute** from his vassals (if any) and **pay tribute** to his lord (if he has one). The amount of tribute each ruler receives from his vassals, and the amount each must pay to his own lord, is determined by the number of families in their realms. While tribute increases as a realm goes larger, there are diminishing returns. The larger a realm becomes, the more difficult and expensive the collection of tribute becomes. Appraising the amount of tribute required, collecting it, transporting it, accounting for its receipt, and storing it are manual processes, each expensive, and each vassal will extract some percentage of tribute for himself before paying his own lord.

Most rulers in the Auran Empire and other fantasy settings lack access to spreadsheets, so a ruler’s title of nobility is usually used as a proxy for estimating how much tribute is owed. The Tribute by Title table provides a range of tribute values for various rules showing how much they would pay by their title.

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Title** | **Tribute (Minimum)** | **Tribute (Average)** | **Tribute (Maximum)** |
| King | 36,000gp (~365,000 families) | 80,000gp (~1,100,000 families) | 110,000gp (~2,000,000 families) |
| Prince | 16,500gp (~87,000 families) | 27,000gp (~205,000 families) | 34,000gp (~322,000 families) |
| Duke | 6850gp (~20,000 families) | 9750gp (~36,000 families) | 12,000gp (~52,000 families) |
| Count | 2850gp (~4600 families) | 3650gp (~6500 families) | 4375gp (~8500 families) |
| Viscount | 1125gp (~960 families) | 1200gp (~1125 families) | 1325gp (~1280 families) |
| Baron | 275gp (~100 families) | 425gp (~200 families) | 550gp (~300 families) |

For NPC rulers, the Judge can select an appropriate value based on the ruler’s title, the families in his realm, and the known wealth and prosperity of his realm. Adventurers can set the tribute for their own vassals as desired. Changing a vassal’s tribute always triggers a roll on the Henchman Loyalty table. If the Judge determines a particular vassal’s tribute is set at an unreasonable level (either too low or too high), he may impose a penalty on all loyalty rolls by the vassal. (Demanding too little tribute suggests the lord is weak and not worthy of respect, demanding too much suggests he is grasping or desperate.)

EXAMPLE #1: Tarkaun Valros Valuin rules the Auran Empire, a realm of 4,319,990 families. He has five vassals, the Exarchs of Tirenea (1,287,000 families), Nicea (1,028,804 families), Krysea (901,624 families), Opelenea (530,419 families), and Southern Argollë (459,255 families). Looking at the Titles of Nobility table, the Judge notes that Tirenea, Nicea, and Krysea are all moderately populated kingdoms, while Opelenea and Southern Argollë are relatively small kingdoms. He decides that the Tarkaun collects the following tribute: Tirenea 85,000gp; Nicea 75,000gp; Krysea 70,000gp; Opelenea 50,000gp; and Southern Argollë 40,000gp. His total revenue from tribute is 320,000gp (it’s good to be the Tarkaun).

EXAMPLE #2: The Exarch of Southern Argollë rules a realm that consists of his personal domain (21,059 families) and four Prefectures with 109,549 families each, for a total of 459,255 families. The Judge rules that he must pay 40,000gp in tribute. The Judge decides that he receives 20,000gp from each of his Prefectures, or 80,000gp total.

**Calculating Precise Tribute (Optional):** Judges who prefer working mathematically can use the following formula to calculate a precise tribute: 18gp x realm families0.6. The Tribute by Realm Families tables, below, can also be used to assess the tribute that a ruler must pay, and the tribute that he collects from each of his vassals. Use the closest value to the actual number of families in the realm. Note that results on the Tribute by Families tables are rounded to the nearest increment of 5gp, while those on the Tribute by Title table are rounded more broadly, so results vary slightly.

OPTIONAL EXAMPLE #1: Tarkaun Drakomir rules the Auran Empire, a realm of 4,319,990 families. He has five vassals, the Exarch of Tirenea (1,287,000 families), Nicea (1,028,804 families), Krysea (901,624 families), Opelenea (530,419 families), Southern Argollë (459,255 families). Consulting the Tribute by Realm Population tables, the Judge determines that the Tarkaun collects the following tribute: Tirenea 83,875gp; Nicea 75,875gp; Krysea 67,270gp; Opelenea 47,445gp; and Southern Argollë 41,275gp. His total revenue from tribute is 315,740gp (it’s good to be the Tarkaun).

OPTIONAL EXAMPLE #2: The Exarch of Southern Argollë rules a realm that consists of his personal domain (21,059 families) and four Prefectures with 109,549 families each, for a total of 459,255 families. According to the Tribute by Realm Population tables, he must pay 41,275gp in tribute. He will receives 19,060gp in tribute from each of his four Prefectures, for a total of 76,240gp.

###### Favors and Duties

In addition to paying tribute to his lord (as described above), a vassal ruler must roll once per month on the Favors and Duties table to see what favors are granted or asked by his lord. These events can serve the Judge as the basis for adventures for the player character. Adventurers with vassals may choose to offer favors and demand duties to their own vassals, either in response to favors and duties they receive, or independently.

During any month, each vassal can be safely asked to perform one ongoing duty, plus an additional ongoing duty for each ongoing favor and each one-time favor given this month. If an adventurer demands duties in excess of this total, the vassal’s loyalty must be checked on the Hireling Loyalty table for each extra duty. There is a cumulative -1 penalty for each additional duty levied on the vassal after the duty that triggers the roll. Note that a one-time favor only offsets a duty during the month it is given (such gifts are quickly taken for granted…). Charters of monopoly count as one favor, even if granted to cover multiple types of merchandise.

A lord may always choose to demand less when demanding a duty. For instance, he might demand a loan of just 0.5gp per family in the vassal’s realm, or levy scutage on only a fraction of the vassal’s overall realm. The entries on the Favor/Duty do not exhaust the possible edicts that a ruler might impose on his vassal. The Judge should feel free to devise additional favors and duties based on the particulars of his campaign setting.

EXAMPLE: Quintus has a vassal named Cadom. Cadom rules a realm with 650 families in his personal domain and 1,600 families in the realm. In the first month of summer, Quintus demands Cadom loan him an amount equal to 1gp per family in his realm, or 1600gp total (one duty). No roll on the Henchman Loyalty table is required, as a lord is entitled to one duty from his vassal. The next month, Quintus leaves the loan unpaid (one duty), and calls Cadom to arms. He gives Cadom a gift of a gilded masterwork longsword worth 1600gp (a favor). No roll on the Henchman Loyalty table is required. The third month he maintains both the unpaid loan and the call to arms but offers no favors. Cadom has now been charged with two duties, with no offsetting favors, so he must now roll on the Henchman Loyalty table.

The fourth month, Quintus finds himself in need of even more troops, so he now calls Cadom to arms again. He offers no favors. Cadom has now been charged with three duties with no offsetting favors. He must make a roll on the Henchmen Loyalty table at -1 (i.e. no roll required for one duty; roll required at no penalty for two duties; roll required at -1 for three duties). Fortunately Cadom remains loyal. In the fifth month, Quintus holds festivals in Cadom’s realm to honor for his military exploits, spending 1600gp towards liturgy expenses in Cadom’s realm. He also repays the loan. Cadom has now received one favor and been charged with two duties, so no roll on the Henchman Loyalty table is required.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Roll (1d20) | Favor / Duty |
| 1 | **Construction:** The vassal is ordered to construct bridges, roads, forts, towers, or other structures somewhere within his realm. If a littoral domain, the vassal may be ordered to construct vessels. Each month, the vassal will be expected to expend a total amount of gp equal to his monthly tribute to the ruler. This duty is automatically revoked when the vassal expends a total of 15,000gp per 6-mile hex in his realm. |
| 2 | **Scutage:** The lord demands the vassal to pay a special tax to fund troops. The tax is equal to 1gp per family in the vassal’s realm. This duty can be imposed multiple times. The tax must be paid each month until the duty is revoked. However, scutage counts as garrison expense for the vassal. In some realms, a vassal may send troops instead of gp (see Call to Arms, below). A lord who receives scutage must spend the funds on troops or provoke Henchman Loyalty rolls at -4. Scutage does not count as domain income for XP purposes. |
| 3 – 4 | **Call to Council:** The vassal is called to provide judicial and managerial council to his lord. He must travel to his lord’s domain to provide this service until the duty is revoked. If this duty is rolled again, the lord summons the vassal’s henchmen in addition (who would issue his own Call to Council upon them). |
| 5 – 6 | **Call to Arms:** The vassal is called to provide military troops to his lord. He must muster an army with troop wages equal to 1gp per family in his realm and make it available to his lord until the duty is revoked. He does not have to go personally unless a Call to Council favor is also demanded. This duty can be imposed multiple times, increasing the gp value of troop wages accordingly. |
| 7 – 8 | **Loan:** The lord demands a loan equal to 1gp per family in the vassal’s realm. The loan is repaid when the duty is revoked. Otherwise, the probability of repayment is equal to the adventurer’s CHA stated as a percentage, rolled monthly. Repayment of the loan revokes the duty. No interest will be paid in either case. This duty can be imposed multiple times. |
| 9 – 12 | **Previous duty/favor revoked:** The vassals loses his most recently granted favor (1) or duty (2 – 6). |
| 13 – 14 | **Charter of Monopoly:** The vassal is granted a monopoly on a particular type of merchandise within his realm. Merchants will buy or sell twice the normal volume of that type from him, and prices are adjusted by 1 price step in his favor. (A lord may not grant a monopoly to a vassal if his lord has already given that monopoly to another, or if he has been awarded it as a favor from his own lord.) This is an ongoing favor. |
| 15 – 16 | **Gift:** The lord gives the vassal a gift with a value at least equal to 1gp per family in the vassal’s realm. The gift may be agricultural investments, land improvements, festivals, treasure, warhorses, slaves, merchandise, magical items, etc. (Judge’s discretion). Gifts increase the vassal recipient’s domain income for XP purposes and decrease the grantor-lord’s. This is a one-time favor. |
| 17 – 18 | **Office:** The vassal is granted a ceremonial office appropriate to his land holdings (e.g. “Knight Marshal,” “Keeper of the Seals,” or “Royal Chancellor”). Holding an office increases a vassal’s prestige and status and grants the officeholder a +1 bonus to loyalty rolls by the officeholder’s own vassals. If the lord’s realm is a senatorial realm (see p. XX), an officeholder must be given a seat on the lord’s senate. This is an ongoing favor. If this favor is granted multiple times, the bonus does not stack, but each office must be revoked separately. |
| 19 | **Troops:** The lord sends a garrison of troops to serve under the vassal’s command. The gp value of the troops will be equal to at least 1gp per family in the vassal’s realm. The lord may specify where in the realm the troops are to be stationed or leave that to the vassal. The vassal is not responsible for paying the wages of the troops. The troops count as part of the garrison of whatever domains they are stationed in. This is an ongoing favor that can be extended multiple times. If the favor is revoked, the lord recalls his troops. It is usually counterbalanced by a demand for scutage. |
| 20 | **Grant of Land:** The vassal is granted an additional domain to add to his realm. The new domain will be at least equal to the size (in hexes) of the smallest of the vassal’s own vassal domains. If the vassal has no vassal domains below him, he is granted a domain consisting of 1 6-mile hex on the border of one of his existing domains. Generate the new domain normally, as per the rules above. The vassal may add the new domain to his personal domain or award it to a sub-vassal, as desired. |

**Calling to Arms:** When a lord calls his vassals to arms, it will take time for the troops to become available for his use. The time required is based on the size of the lord’s realm, as shown on the adjoining table. One half the requested troops (rounded up) will arrive within the first time period after the leader begins mustering troops. Another quarter (rounded down, minimum 1) will arrive during the second time period. The remainder of the troops becomes available in the third period. The lengthy amount of time required to muster troops by large realms is a major reason why many realms are divided into small domains with local forces that can respond to raids and skirmishes quickly. See **Armies** (p. XX) for more details.

**Scutage Demanded:** When a lord demands scutage, it will take time for the funds to become available for his use. The time is required is based on the size of the lord’s realm. One half the requested funds (rounded up) will arrive at the end of the first time period after the leader demands a tax. Another quarter (rounded down, minimum 1) will arrive at the end of the second time period. The remainder of the funds become available at the end of the third period. Scutage will thereafter arrive monthly until the duty is revoked. Because demanding scutage is cumbersome, lords typically avoid demanding scutage except to maintain standing armies (in which case it is an ongoing duty) or in cases of very special need.

**Standing Armies:** The Favor / Duty table assumes that “scutage” duties and “troops” favors are relatively rare edicts that represent special circumstances. However, some realms might be organized with a full-time standing army. A standing army would be represented in game with a combination of ongoing “scutage” duties and “troops” favors. The favors and duties even out; the rules put a standing army and feudal army on equal footing. A vassal can still have his own private troops even if he has a standing army paid for by his lord; it is not unusual for realms to include both standing armies and household forces. It is up to the Judge to determine if the standing army’s forces are under the command of the local ruler or have their own separate commanders.

EXAMPLE: The Tarkaun of the Auran Empire demands two “scutage” duties from all of his Exarchs, each of whom must therefore send him 2gp per family. (They in turn make the same demand of their Prefects, who demand it of their Palatines, etc.) The Empire has a population of 4,300,000 families, which yields scutage of 8,600,000gp. The Tarkaun spends this gold on the Auran Army, maintaining a force of 344,000 troops with wages of 8.6 million gp per month. He then uses “troops” favors to deploy these troops in the Empire. He provides many more troops to areas such as the Borderlands or the Kemeshi border, and many fewer troops to the safe interior of Tirenea. In the Auran Empire, domain rulers have both civil and military authority, so the legionaries of the Auran Empire are under the command of the local leaders where they are deployed.

###### Non-Henchman Vassals

Rather than assigning multiple vassal domains to a henchman who then has to sub-assign the vassal domain to his own henchmen, a ruler may **assign vassal domains** to **non-henchmen.** These may be NPC adventurers, mercenary commanders, specialists, etc. Non-henchmen rulers have a base loyalty of -2 instead of 0. If the non-henchman vassal’s domain is outside the range of trade of his ruler’s largest urban settlement, a non-henchman’s base loyalty is -4. (See ***ACKS II Judges Journal****,* p. XXX for details on range of trade.) During any month, a non-henchman vassal can only be safely asked to perform one duty for each favor given (there is no “free” duty, as there is with a henchman). If the ruler demands duties in excess of this total, the non-henchman vassal’s loyalty must be checked on the Henchman Loyalty table for each extra duty.

###### Tribute Inefficiency

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Number of Vassals** | **Tribute Received** |
| 16,384 or more | 1% |
| 4,096 – 16,384 | 5% |
| 1,025 – 4,095 | 10% |
| 217 – 1,024 | 20% |
| 64 – 216 | 33% |
| 17 – 63 | 50% |
| 9 – 16 | 66% |
| 8 or less | 100% |

Sometimes a ruler may conclude that he can increase his tribute by having many weak vassals. Since the per capita tribute is greater from a baron than a prince, for instance, a king might decide to have 400 barons instead of 4 princes as vassals. However, the more vassals a ruler maintains, the more difficult and expensive the collection of tribute becomes. Appraising the amount of tribute required, collecting it, transporting it, accounting for its receipt, and storing it are manual processes, each expensive by themselves and susceptible to loss from banditry, corruption, graft, and simple stupidity.

These inefficiencies are reflected by reducing the actual tribute received from vassals. Consult the Tribute Inefficiency table to assess how much a ruler actually receives. The “missing” tribute of course still exists in the economy but it’s not available to the ruler — it’s eaten up by crime, corruption, or waste.

EXAMPLE: Tarkaun Drakomir decides to purge all mid-tier nobles from the Auran Empire and rule his realm of 4,319,990 families by having 21,600 patricians with 200 families each owing 430gp in tribute, for a total of 9,288,000gp per month.

However, the massive inefficiencies of having 21,600 direct reports means he only gets 1% of that — 92,880gp per month. That’s much less than the 320,000gp he got by having exarchs! Tarkaun Drakomir goes broke and is overthrown. Later, he writes a memoir explaining that his efforts at popular rule were foiled by a military junta.

What if instead of replacing five exarchs with 21,600 patricians, Drakomir had gone with twenty prefects each with about 215,000 families?

He’d demand 27,000gp in tribute from each prefect, or 540,000gp. But he’d only get 50% of that, or 270,000gp, so he’s still worse off — he’s earning less, and he now has a dozen or more non-henchman vassals to worry about.

### Keeping the Peace

###### Base Morale Score

All domains have a morale scorewhich represent their populations’ trust and faith in their ruler. Domains begin with a **base morale score** of 0 plus or minus their ruler’s Charisma adjustment and certain modifiers based on the ruler’s personal authority, his stronghold, his domain classification, his garrison, and his religion. Base morale score only changes if the ruler’s Charisma adjustment, personal authority, stronghold, or garrison modifiers change. Round penalties up; round bonuses down.

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Modifier** | **Base Morale Score** | **Modifier** | **Base Morale Score** |
| Personal authority | By Level & Income | Insufficient stronghold | -1/-2/-3 |
| Leadership proficiency | +1 | Lawful/Chaotic ruler, Neutral domain | -1 |
| Neutral ruler, Chaotic domain | -1 | Neutral ruler, Lawful domain | -1 |
| Lawful ruler, Chaotic domain | -2 | Chaotic ruler, Lawful domain | -2 |
| Domain classified borderlands | -1 | Domain classified outlands | -2 |
| Additional troops in borderlands | +1 | Additional troops in outlands | +1/+2 |

**Personal Authority:** “Happy is the land whose king is a noble leader” is more than just a proverb. In times of peril and war, the commoners and nobility both demand leaders with the strength to protect their interests. Weak leaders will be marginalized, deposed, or slain. Of course, “strong” and “weak” are relative to the size of the realm. A strong baron may be a weak emperor. **Personal authority** measures the strength of the ruler relative to his domain and applies as a modifier to his domain’s **base morale score**. Cross reference the ruler’s class level with his domain income on the Personal Authority table.

EXAMPLE: Legate Ulrand Valerian is an 8th level fighter with CHA 13 who rules a domain with an income of 4,450gp per month. Cross-referencing his class level (8) with his domain income (4,450gp), the Judge finds that Valerian’s personal authority is 0. Combined with his Charisma bonus of +1, this gives his domain a base morale score of +1. If Legate Valerian were slain and his wife (a 0-level normal woman with CHA 16) took over, her personal authority modifier would be -4, which combined with her Charisma bonus of +2 would yield a base morale score of -2. (Assuming she remains in power, her XP from running the domain would advance her in level until she reached a personal authority of 0.)

| 14 | +4 | +4 | +4 | +4 | +4 | +4 | +4 | +4 | +4 | +4 | +3 | +2 | +1 | 0 | -1 |

**Designer’s Note:** Because of how the GP Threshold for campaign XP works in ***ACKS****,* a ruler of a realm will tend to advance in level of experience until he reaches a personal authority of 0, and then stop advancing. Most rulers will be just below, at, or just above that level, so Personal Authority for NPC realms can generally be assumed to average out to 0 (or roll 1d3-2). Specific calculations need be used only for PC realms or special situations such as young or inexperienced rulers, recent conquests, and so on.

**Leadership Proficiency:** If the ruler has the Leadership proficiency, his domain’s base morale score is increased by 1.

**Insufficient Stronghold:** A domain’s base morale score is decreased if its stronghold is insufficient. An insufficient stronghold is one whose value is below the minimum required to secure the territory of the domain. Apply a -1 modifier to base morale score if the stronghold value is at least half the minimum, by -2 if at least one quarter the minimum, and by -3 if less than one quarter the minimum. A stronghold that is damaged or destroyed by war can become insufficient for its domain.

**Domain Classification:** Domains on the frontier are less well-regulated, and prone to unruliness, disrespect for authority, and lawlessness. Borderlands domains suffer a -1 penalty to base morale, while outland domains suffer a -2 penalty to base morale. These penalties can be alleviated with additional troops.

**Additional Troops:** A strong garrison can reduce the lawlessness of borderland and outlands domains. A borderlands domain gains a +1 bonus to base morale if 1gp per peasant family of additional troops are garrisoned in the domain. An outlands domain gains a +1 bonus to base morale if 1gp per peasant family of additional troops are garrisoned in the domain, and a +2 bonus if 2gp per peasant family of additional troops are garrisoned in the domain.

**Alignment & Religion:** The inhabitants of a realm cannot tell what alignment their ruler is directly, so they will do so based on his apparent religious practices. A domain is considered to be Lawful if it is predominantly populated by humans and demi-humans who worship Lawful gods. In the Auran Empire setting, this would include the Auran Empire itself, Northern Argollë, Rorn, and Somirea. A domain is considered to be Chaotic if it is predominantly populated by beastmen or by any creatures who worship Chaotic gods. In the Auran Empire setting, this would include Celdorea and Kemesh. (Jutland and Skysostan, being shamanistic, are Neutral.) A domain’s religion (and hence its alignment) can be changed by the ruler but doing so is not easy — see **Introducing a New Religion**, below.

###### Current Morale Score

A domain’s **current morale score** may differ from its base morale score depending on the ruler’s decisions. Any change to a domain’s base morale score immediately changes its current morale score. In addition, at the end of each month, the Judge will roll 2d6 on the Domain Morale table, applying any relevant adjustments to the roll, to determine whether the domain’s morale has changed as a result of recent events. Round penalties up; round bonuses down. A natural roll of 2 always reduces current morale by 2, while a natural roll of 12 always increases current morale by 2.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Domain Morale** | |
| **Adjusted Die Roll** | **Result** |
| 2- | Morale reduced by 2 (min -4) |
| 3 – 5 | Morale reduced by 1 (min -4) |
| 6 – 8 | Morale shifts by 1 towards base |
| 9 – 11 | Morale increased by 1 (max +4) |
| 12+ | Morale increased by 2 (max +4) |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Monthly Events** | **Morale Roll Adjustment** |
| Garrison expenditure below 2gp/family this month | -1/gp below |
| Domain invaded and occupied by enemy army | 0, then -1 per month |
| Domain pillaged by enemy army | -4 |
| 1gp/family in troops repressing domain this month | +1\* |
| 2gp/family in troops repressing domain this month | +2\* |
| Additional troops repressing domain this month | +1#/gp above |
| Liturgy expense above 1gp/family this month | +1/gp above |
| Liturgy expense below 1gp/family this month | -1/gp below |
| Taxes above 2gp/family this month | -1/gp above |
| Taxes below 2gp/family this month | +1/gp below |
| Tithes not paid this month | -1 |
| Ruler introduces or maintains worship of god of different alignment this month | -4 |
| Ruler maintains worship of god of different alignment this month | -2 |
| Ruler administers domain | +1 |
| Calamity affects domain this month | Varies |

\* Current morale score cannot exceed 0 when repressed

**Invasion and Occupation**: A domain does not suffer an immediate penalty to its morale roll when it is invaded. As has been proven in countless wars throughout history, people are often stubbornly resilient in the defense of their homes. However, if the number of invading troops is sufficiently large enough to constitute an occupying garrison (see**Invading, Conquering, Occupying, and Pillaging Domains** on p. XX), and the invading army remains in the domain for more than a month, it begins to suffer a cumulative penalty of -1 per month on each morale roll, to a maximum of -4.

**Pillage:** If a domain is pillaged by an enemy army (see**Invading, Conquering, Occupying, and Pillaging Domains** on p. XX), it suffers a -4 penalty on its next morale roll. This penalty is in lieu of any penalty for occupation (they do not stack).

**Repressing Peasantry:** Rather than deploy its garrison on a military campaign outside the domain, a ruler may deploy some or all of the garrison to repress the peasantry. However, a militia cannot be deployed to repress the peasantry. A domain gains a +1 bonus to morale rolls if 1gp per family of additional troops is repressing the peasants, a +2 bonus if 2gp per family of additional troops is repressing the peasants, and an additional +1 bonus per full gp per family of additional troops repressing the domain. However, a repressed domain’s current morale score can never be higher than 0 (Apathetic).

**Introducing a New Religion:** A ruler can simply command his subjects to worship his god, creating vast congregations within his domain. Typically such commands shift the focus of a domain’s worship from one god to another of the same alignment. For instance, a lord might command his realm to emphasize worship Ianna, rather than Ammonar. This does not count as changing religion for morale purposes. However, demanding the worship a god of a different alignment is incredibly damaging to domain morale.

The domain suffers a -4 penalty to its morale rolls in the first month the new religion is introduced, and a -2 penalty thereafter until either the ruler allows the domain’s families to return to their old faith or until a majority of the domain converts to the new religion. Conversion occurs if the domain’s current morale reaches Stalwart (+4) or if the domain’s ruler or chaplain ever acquires congregants equal to more than half the domain’s population (see **Congregants and Divine Power**, p. XX).

**Administering the Domain:** If the ruler or his magistrate administered the domain that month, he gains a +1 bonus on that month’s domain morale roll. Administering the domain is a campaign activity discussed under **Ruling the Realm** (p. XX).

**Calamities:** Various vagaries and calamities can befall a domain in the course of play, ranging from plague to earthquakes to magical transformation of the land into a living hellscape (as happened to the domain of Detroit, Michigan). The Judge can impose a penalty on the domain’s morale rolls based on calamities that occur. A minor calamity that causes property damage inflicts a -1 penalty. A major calamity that causes substantial property damage and loss of life inflicts a -2 to -3 penalty. An utter catastrophe (such as a *cataclysm* or *plague* ritual) inflicts a -4 penalty. (Since tracking the floods, droughts, and plagues of NPC domains is a lot of work, and given that calamities were commonplace in history, the Judge can just assume a default of -1 for NPC domains each month if desired.)

EXAMPLE: Marcus, a Lawful 9th level fighter with CHA 13, is ruler of a domain with 1,200 families with an income of 14,000gp per month. This gives him a personal authority modifier of 0. His stronghold is of standard value. His garrison of 40 heavy cavalry costs 2,400gp per month, the required amount. His domain is within the Auran Empire and its people, like Marcus, worship the Empyrean gods, so there is no modifier for religion. Therefore his domain has a base morale score of +1 (Loyal). After several months of good rulership, his domain has a current morale score of +2.

However, after accidentally donning a **helm of alignment change**,Marcus becomes Chaotic and starts worshipping the chthonic gods. His new alignment reduces his domain’s base morale by 2, to -1. The change in base morale score immediately reduces the domain’s current morale score from +2 to 0. Worse, the newly villainous Marcus decides to start running his domain with an iron fist. He pays no tithes (-1) and raises taxes from 2gp to 4gp per peasant (-2). At the end of the month, he makes a domain morale roll of 2d6-3 for his domain’s loyalty. He rolls a 5, which after adjustment results in a 2. That means his domain’s current morale score drops by 2 points, from 0 to -2, to Turbulent.

The next month, Marcus decides to deploy his entire garrison of 40 heavy cavalry to repress the domain. He uses the additional 2,400gp of taxes he’s charging to hire 40 mercenary heavy cavalry to repress as well. The domain’s morale roll is modified by +2 because the entire garrison is repressing the peasants, with an additional +2 from spending an extra 2gp per family to repress the peasants. He continues to pay no tithes (-1) and continues to charge high taxes (-2). At the end of the month, he makes a domain morale roll of 2d6+ 4- 3 for his domain’s loyalty; the result is an 8. His domain’s current morale score shifts one point towards its base morale score of -1. Had Marcus not deployed troops to repress the peasants, his die roll would have had a modified result of 4, and his domain’s current morale score would have dropped by one point, from -2 to -3.

Marcus decides to change his approach. He reduces taxes back to 2gp per peasant (0). He introduces the Chthonic faith to his domain (-4), to which he pays tithes (0), but then spends an extra 2gp per peasant family on liturgies to introduce them to their new religion (+2). He continues to repress them with his garrison and mercenaries (+4). He rolls 2d6+6-4 and gets a 9. His domain’s current morale score now increases to 0.

In order to convert the peasants of his domain to his new faith, he must raise its morale to +4. However, a domain cannot have a morale greater than 0 if it is being repressed. Marcus therefore relinquishes his mercenaries and orders his cavalry back to their barracks. He maintains taxes at 2gp per peasant (0), continues to proselytize the Chthonic faith (-2), and increases his liturgy expenditure to 5gp per peasant family (+5). He rolls 2d6+ 5- 2 and gets a 10. His domain’s current morale score now increases to +1.

If Marcus is eventually able to raise his domain’s morale to Stalwart (+4), he will have successfully introduced the new religion into his domain and converting its alignment to his own. This will increase his base morale to +1 and alleviate the ongoing -2 penalty to his morale rolls.

###### Effects of Morale

A domain’s current morale scores affects its functioning as described below.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Effects of Current Morale** | |
| **Morale Score** | **Morale Level** |
| -4 | Rebellious |
| -3 | Defiant |
| -2 | Turbulent |
| -1 | Demoralized |
| 0 | Apathetic |
| +1 | Loyal |
| +2 | Dedicated |
| +3 | Steadfast |
| +4 | Stalwart |

**Rebellious** means that the domain is revolting against their ruler. All rolls on the Vagaries of Recruitment tables are at -20. All vassal loyalty rolls are at -2 due to the ruler’s uneasy grip on power. There is no population growth, and an extra 4d10 families per thousand are lost to illness, casualties, and emigration each month. Conscripts and militia cannot be levied. The able-bodied men (one per family) become bandits, and begin to attack officials, trade caravans, troops, and travelers in the domain. With no workers, the domain’s tax, land, trade, and service income drop to zero. Each month there is a cumulative 10% chance that an NPC emerges from the ranks of the bandits to challenge the character’s rule. The NPC will have a level of experience sufficient to grant him a personal authority of +0.

**Defiant** means that the domain’s inhabitants have become violently unhappy with their ruler. This unhappiness manifests in banditry, tax evasion, and disloyalty. All rolls on the Vagaries of Recruitment tables are at -10. All vassal loyalty rolls are at -1. An extra 3d10 families per thousand are lost to illness, casualties, and emigration each month. Conscripts and militia cannot be levied. Tax, land, trade, and service income are halved as one able-bodied man per two families becomes a bandit, as above. Each month there is a cumulative 5% chance that an NPC emerges from the ranks of the bandits to challenge the character’s rule.

**Turbulent** means that the domain is in a state of dissatisfaction and unrest. All rolls on the Vagaries of Recruitment tables are at -5. An extra 2d10 families per thousand are lost to illness, casualties, and emigration each month. Conscripts and militia cannot be levied. Tax, land, trade, and service income is reduced by 20% as one able-bodied man per five families becomes as a bandit, as above. Each month there is a cumulative 1% chance that an NPC emerges from the ranks of the bandits to challenge the character’s rule.

**Demoralized** means that the domain’s populace sees their ruler as worse than average. An extra 1d10 families per thousand are lost to illness, casualties, and immigration each month. Conscripts and militia levied from the domain suffer a -1 decrease to their morale scores.

**Apathetic** means that the domain’s populace sees their ruler as just another petty noble. They work the land, pay their taxes, and do their duty, but have no special love for their ruler. Conscripts and militia levied from the domain suffer a -1 decrease to their morale scores.

**Loyal** means that the domain’s ruler is respected and popular with his subjects. Spies and thieves operating against the domain suffer a -1 penalty to their proficiency throws (see **Hijinks**,below). The population grows by an extra 1d10 families per thousand each month.

**Dedicated** means that the domain’s populace has been inspired to strong loyalist sentiment by their ruler. Spies and thieves operating against the domain suffer a -2 penalty to their proficiency throws. The population grows by an extra 2d10 families per thousand each month. All rolls on the Vagaries of Recruitment tables are at +5.

**Steadfast** means that the domain’s inhabitants hail their ruler as great leader deserving of strident support. The population grows by an extra 3d10 families per thousand each month. Spies and thieves operating against the domain suffer a -3 penalty to their proficiency throws. All rolls on the Vagaries of Recruitment tables are at +10. Conscripts and militia levied from the domain gain a +1 bonus to their morale scores. All vassal loyalty rolls are at +1.

**Stalwart** means that the domain’s populace acclaims their ruler as a beloved and righteous sovereign. The population grows by an extra 4d10 families per thousand each month. Spies and thieves operating against the domain suffer a -4 penalty to their proficiency throws. Conscripts and militia levied from the domain gain a +1 bonus to their morale scores. All rolls on the Vagaries of Recruitment tables are at +20. All vassal loyalty rolls are at +2 due to the ruler’s secure base of power.

###### Dealing with Bandits

Domains with current morale scores of -2 or less will be plagued by bandits. Bandits count as an enemy army, and if left unchecked, they can cause a domain’s current morale score to drop even further because of the cumulative penalty from enemy army occupation.

A ruler has two options to deal with bandits. He can attempt to defeat them with his troops, or he can attempt to increase his domain’s morale score. If ruler attacks and successfully defeats the bandits, the current morale of his domain is increased by 1, but the population of his domain is reduced by the number of bandits killed (e.g. killing 100 bandits reduces the population by 100 families). Bandits taken prisoner rather than killed can be freed and will return to work. If the domain’s morale is not at least -1 or better when the prisoners are freed, the appropriate percentage will return to banditry the following month.

EXAMPLE: Anárion rules a domain of 1,600 peasants. Due to some mismanagement, his domain’s morale slips to -3. One able-boded worker per two families becomes a bandit, leaving his domain with just 800 families while Anárion now find himself facing a veritable army of 800 bandits! He immediately takes to the field and defeats them, with 400 bandits killed and 400 captured. Anárion’s current domain morale increases from -3 to -2 because of the victory. He then restores the 400 prisoners to their lands, restoring his domain to 1,200 families. However, he unwisely neglects to take any other actions to increase his domain’s morale. The next month, his domain’s current morale remains -2, so one able-bodied worker per five families becomes a bandit. Since he has 1,200 families, that’s 240 bandits.

If the ruler manages to raise his domain’s morale score, the number of bandits is decreased accordingly without diminishing the population. For instance, a ruler who increases his domain’s morale score from -4 to -3 will reduce the number of bandits from one per family to one per two families, while a ruler who increases his domain’s morale score from -2 to -1 would reduce the number of bandits to zero. If an NPC emerges from the ranks of the bandits to challenge the character’s rule, he will offer battle at the first opportunity. If the ruler does not meet him in battle, the NPC will begin to loot or pillage the domain, imposing a -4 penalty on its morale rolls.

| 200,000 | 4,999 |
| 625,000 | 19,999 |
| 2,500,000 | 100,000 |

When a domain reaches its limit of growth, its ruler will normally secure an additional area of land to permit the population to grow. Instead of (or in addition to) doing so, he may choose to found an **urban settlement** within his domain. To found an urban settlement, a ruler must make an initial investment of 10,000gp and then move between 75 to 249 peasant families from his domain into the urban settlement.

Once established, an urban settlement functions much like a separate domain, except that the ruler can directly manage both his domain and the urban settlement within the domain. A ruler cannot directly manage a domain and an urban settlement located in a different domain, however.

###### Growing the Settlement

As with a domain, the ruler will make two die rolls of 1d10 per 1,000 families in the urban settlement each month to determine the change in the settlement’s population. If a character actively adventures at least once per month and keeps his urban settlement secure from threats, the settlement’s population will grow by an additional amount each month from immigration, using the Domain Population Growth table.

Unlike domains, the limits of an urban settlement’s growth are not based the available land. Instead, the limits are based on the extent of **urban investment**.Initially, the urban settlement is limited to less than 250 families. When the Total Investment shown on the table below is reached, the urban settlement expands to accommodate a greater maximum.

By spending more gold pieces on roads, aqueducts, sewers, marketplaces, walls, and other infrastructure, a ruler can increase the maximum population size of the urban settlement. In addition to increasing the maximum population, **urban investment** also attracts new residents. For every 1,000gp spent on investments in a month, the settlement will attract 1d10 new urban families. A ruler cannot spend more than his domain’s revenue on urban investment each month.

###### Collecting Revenue

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Settlement**  **Population**  **(families)** | **Trade**  **Revenue**  **(gp/family)** | **Market**  **Class** |
| 75 – 249 | 1 | Class VI |
| 250 – 499 | 1.5 | Class V |
| 500 – 2,499 | 1.5 | Class IV |
| 2,500 – 4,999 | 1.5 | Class III |
| 5,000 – 19,999 | 2 | Class II |
| 20,000 – 100,000 | 2.5 | Class I |

Each month, a ruler will collect revenue from each urban family in his domain. Like peasant families, urban families generate 4gp of service revenue and 2gp of tax revenue per month. (If the domain is levying higher or lower taxes, this will apply to the urban settlement.) Instead of land value, urban families generate trade revenue, representing tolls, duties, tariffs, rent, and other fees paid by the residents and itinerants to the ruler. Trade revenue begins at 1gp per family per month and increases with the size of the settlement. Rulers may also profit from taking advantage of the urban settlement as a market. Each urban settlement has a market class based on its size. See **Mercantile Ventures** for more details on markets.

###### Paying Expenses

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Expense** | **Monthly Cost** |
| Garrison | 2gp/family |
| Liturgies | 1gp/family |
| Tithes | 1gp/family |
| Upkeep | 1gp/family |
| Tribute | Special |

Settlement expenses are similar to domain expenses. Each month, the ruler must pay a garrison cost of 2gp per urban family, a liturgies expense of 1gp per urban family, an upkeep expense of 1gp per urban family, and a tithe of 1gp per urban family. If the ruler is paying higher or lower liturgies for the domain, apply the same value to the urban settlement.

**Tribute:** Urban families are added to the total in the realm for purposes of tribute.

**Upkeep Expenses:** Unpaid upkeep expenses reduce the total investment value of the urban settlement. If this results in the settlement dropping to a lower market class, any excess urban families emigrate in search of better economic conditions and are lost.

###### Keeping the Peace

Urban settlements share the base and current morale score of the domain within which they are located; they do not have a separate morale score. Add the urban settlement’s income to the domain income to determine the ruler’s personal authority modifier.

###### Dissolution of an Urban Settlement

Urban settlements depend on a large population to support the necessary division of labor. If fewer than 75 urban families are ever present in a settlement, the urban settlement dissolves into the hamlets of the peasantry and become peasant families. Remove the urban settlement and replace the urban families with peasant families in the nearby hexes.

###### Villages, Towns, and Cities Benchmarks

The Villages, Towns, and Cities table, below, shows the average monthly income, after expenses, of urban settlements of various sizes (excluding tribute). This table can be used to quickly determine the income generated by an urban settlement located within a domain, excluding tribute. Remember to add the number of urban families to the total in the realm for purposes of tribute!

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Villages, Towns, and Cities** | | |
| **Urban Settlement (families)** | **Monthly Income** | **Market Class** |
| Hamlets (74-) | 0gp | Class VI\* |
| Small Village (75 – 99) | 150 – 199gp | Class VI |
| Village (100 – 159) | 200 – 319gp | Class VI |
| Village (160 – 249) | 320 – 624gp | Class VI |
| Large village (250-499) | 625 – 12494gp | Class V |

| \*Class VI market at domain’s stronghold only | | |

### Ruling the Realm

An adventurer who has become the ruler of a domain or realm gains access to a number of campaign activities. Some campaign activities can be delegated to magistrates, who act in his place. The ruler or magistrate must be in the domain to undertake the activity.

**Administering Domain:** The tasks of a ruler are many and varied: holding court, passing laws, standing in judgment, presiding over assemblies of the people and nobility, erecting public works, drafting budgets, performing religious ceremonies, and more. These tasks are collectively referred to as administering a domain. Administering a domain is an ongoing dedicated activity that requires 1/2 x [ (number of 6 miles hexes in the ruler’s personal domain) + (number of vassals reporting to ruler) + (6 – market class of largest urban settlement in ruler’s personal domain) ] days to complete. Rulers who administer their domain gain a +1 bonus on domain morale rolls and a +5% bonus on domain XP that month. The ruler can delegate this activity to his steward.

**Inspecting Troops:** A ruler of at least 5th level with **Manual of Arms** proficiency can inspect troops under his command. Each company inspected counts as an ancillary activity. Troops that have been inspected by their commander gain a +1 bonus to their first attack throw within the next day. The ruler can delegate this activity to his captain of the guard.

**Issuing Decrees:** A domain rulerin his domain can issue a decree, changing the laws of his realm. Issuing a decree is an ancillary activity. Issuing decrees is the method by which various decisions get implemented in the game world, including:

* Changing the rate of taxes or liturgies within the character’s domain
* Granting a favor to a vassal
* Demanding a duty of a vassal
* Freeing a perpetrator caught committing a crime
* Ordering the construction of a new stronghold within the character’s domain
* Ordering agricultural or urban investment within the character’s domain

When giving favors, ordering construction, or ordering investment, the gp cost is immediately paid. (If desired, Judges may deduct the expense at a rate of 500gp per day, but this is usually more book-keeping than its worth.) Morale rolls triggered by demanding duties are rolled immediately. Funds from taxes or duties are received during the Revenue Collection sub-phase of the following month.

**Overseeing Investments:** A domain ruler can personally oversee agricultural or urban investment he has ordered there. Overseeing investment is an ongoing ancillary activity lasting 1 day per 500gp of investment. As workers perform better when inspired and supervised by their liege, the investment will attract 1d10+1 new families instead of the usual 1d10 per 1,000gp. The ruler can delegate this activity to his munerator.

**Overseeing Construction:** A domain ruler can personally oversee a construction project in his domain. Overseeing construction is an ongoing ancillary activity lasting until the project is complete. However, a character who supervises construction as a dedicated activity (see below) can oversee construction at the same time as an incidental activity. Laborers work harder when overseen by the domain ruler, so their construction rate is increased by 5%, or by 10% if the ruler is also supervising construction (see below). The bonus continues for as long as the character oversees construction. The ruler can delegate this activity to his munerator or steward.

**Overseeing Troop Training:** A domain ruler of at least 5th level with Manual of Armsproficiency can personally oversee the training of conscripts or militia he has called up (see p. XX). Overseeing training counts as one ongoing ancillary activity per 60 troops. The time required is based on the type of troop the men are being trained to become. Oversight must be maintained throughout the entire training time or the benefit is list. However, a character who trains troops as a dedicated activity (see below) can oversee training of those troops at the same time as a incidental activity. Troops whose training is overseen by their domain ruler receive a permanent +1 bonus to their morale score for as long as they remain in his service. The ruler can delegate this activity to his captain of the guard.

**Summoning the Senate:** A domain ruler of a senatorial republic (p. XX) can summon the senate to consult with him. Consulting the senate is a singular dedicated activity for each matter discussed by the senate. A ruler consulting the senate can issue decrees approved by the senate as an incidental activity. The ruler cannot delegate this activity.

**Supervising Construction:** A domain ruler with sufficient ranks of Engineering or Siege Engineering proficiency can serve as the construction supervisor for a construction project in his domain. Supervising construction is an ongoing dedicated activity lasting until the project is complete. A ruler supervising construction can oversee construction (see above) as an incidental activity. The ruler can delegate this activity to his munerator or steward, if he qualifies.

**Training Troops:** A domain ruler with sufficient ranks of Manual at Arms (and Riding and/or Weapon Focus where necessary) can serve as the marshaltraining up to 60 conscripts or militia (p. XX). Training troops is an ongoing dedicated activity. The time required is based on the type of troop the men are being trained to become. A ruler training troops can oversee training (see above) as an incidental activity. The ruler can delegate this activity to his captain of the guard, if he qualifies.

**Waging War:** A domain ruler can undertake a military campaign. Military campaigning is an ongoing strenuous dedicated activity. It is considered to begin when a character leads his army’s troops out of their garrisons, and end when the character returns his army’s troops to garrison or hands over command. While waging war the ruler will have to pay for the cost of armorers, quartermasters, and supplies for his army, so waging war is a very expensive activity. See Chapters 8 – 11 for comprehensive rules on waging war. The ruler can delegate this activity to his captain of the guard.

### Special Domain Types

The peoples of the world are many and varied, and so too are their political organizations. These rules supplement the earlier rules to allow the Judge to include other types of domains in his setting.

###### Barbarian Clanholds

Not every domain and realm is civilized and cosmopolitan. Many domains are made up of loose-knit collections of clans and tribes who eke out existence as pastoralists or horticulturalists. Clanholds are similar to ordinary domains, with the following special rules:

* Clanholds are always classified as outlands domains. They cannot exceed 125 peasant families per 6-mile hex and 2,000 per 24-mile hex. Clanhold peasants subsist through simple horticulture, local pastoralism, and foraging. They do not rotate their crops, irrigate their fields, terrace their hills, or practice the other land improvements that civilizations use to intensively cultivate land. As a result the population density of clanholds is limited.
* Clanhold families consists of one warrior and one or more noncombatants, including woman, young, elderly, and/or thralls.
* Provided the chieftain actively adventures or raids at least once per month, his clanhold’s population will grow by an additional amount each month, determined by the number of families already present. Use the table on p. XX*,* but treat the clanhold as if it were two population categories smaller than an equivalent human domain, so it grows faster.
* Clanhold settlements are limited to less than 250 urban families (Market Class VI). They cannot be increased in size or market class with urban investment. At no time can the number of urban families in a clanhold exceed 12.5% of the peasant population of the clanhold.
* Clanhold chieftains cannot conscript peasants or levy a militia from their domain like ordinary rulers (see p. XX). Instead, clanhold chieftains can **levy clanhold warriors**, up to 1 warrior per family (see p. XX).
* Because of their primitive political structures, clanhold chieftains are limited in the favors they can offer and duties they can demand of their vassals. Chieftains cannot **call to council***,* except for purposes of war, and cannot**demand****loans**at all. They cannot offer **charters****of****monopoly**or**grants****of****title***.* When chieftains **call****to****arms** they can call for half the available clan warriors as one favor, or all clan warriors as two favors.
* Clanhold chieftains can establish realms either by founding additional clanholds and assigning them to a henchman to manage, or by conquering and annexing an existing domain (see Chapter 10). Clanhold chieftains can offer and demand the full range of favors and duties from their ordinary vassal domains . However, ordinary (e.g. civilized) human and demi-human domains subjected to clanhold rule reduce their base morale score by 2 points, in addition to any penalty from alignment.
* Clanholds can be added to the realms of ordinary rulers. The clanhold domain(s) and ordinary domain(s) follow the rules for their domain type. The ruler can only offer and demand the full range of favors and duties from his ordinary vassal domains, but can only offer and demand the favors and duties available to clanhold chieftains from his clanhold vassals.

Beastmen domains are always barbarian clanholds unless ruled by a chaotic human or monster ruler of great power and intelligence (discussed below). Some human domains and realms are also clanholds. In the Auran Empire campaign setting, clanholds are primarily found in Skysostan, the northern regions of Jutland, and the western portions of the Ivory Kingdoms. At the Judge’s discretion, a barbarian or shaman might establish a clanhold instead of an ordinary domain.

###### Transitional Domains

A **transitional domain** is half-way between a clanhold and ordinary (civilized) domain. It represents the liminal stage when clan-based society begins to develop complex social hierarchies, enact formal laws, establish larger settlements, and achieve stable governance.

A clanhold domain can become a transitional domain if it meets the following criteria:

* The ruler is a human, demi-human or sapient monster other than a beastman;
* The ruler rules an urban settlement of at least 150 families; and
* Either the domain is adjacent to an ordinary domain, the ruler rules a realm with one or more civilized or transitional vassal domains, or the ruler is the vassal of a civilized or transitional domain.

The ruler decides if and when the clanhold domain becomes a transitional domain. The decision is made by issuing a decree (p. XX). Once made, the decision is irrevocable, as the formerly robust and hardy clanhold warriors soon grow soft and fat on the spoils of civilization and abandon the ways of their ancestors.

Transitional domains function like clanholds, with the following exceptions:

* A transitional domain can be civilized, but only if within 24 miles of a city or large town in the same realm. A transitional domain can be borderlands, but only if within 48 miles of civilized areas in the same realm.
* A transitional domain can exceed 125 peasant families per 6-mile hex, but the excess peasant families provide only half the normal land revenue.
* An urban settlement in a transitional domains is not limited to 250 families or 12.5% of the peasant population, and can be increased in size or market class. However, the value of investment in transitional domains is halved, e.g. it takes 2,000gp to attract 1d10 new families and 50,000gp to achieve market class V. In addition, trade revenue cannot exceed 1gp per family regardless of the settlement population.
* The ruler of a transitional domain can levy militia and conscript troops, but cannot call clanhold warriors. He can offer and demand the full range of favors and duties available.
* Ordinary human and demi-human domains subject to a transitional domain do not suffer the special -2 penalty to morale since the ruler isn’t a mere barbarian.

EXAMPLE: Raknar once ruled a clanhold domain consisting of 10 6-mile hexes. After he became a vassal of Moruvai, a Zaharan ruinguard who rules a flourishing realm, he decreed that his clanhold become a transitional domain. Moruvai’s domain has a large town within 48 miles of Raknar’s domain, so Raknar’s domain became classified as a borderlands domain,. As a borderlands domain, Raknar’s realm could have up to 250 families per 6-mile hex. Through time and investment, Raknar has reached this limit in each of his 10 hexes, so he has 2,500 orc peasant families. The 126th – 250th peasant families in each hex provide only half the normal land value. Raknar has also invested 50,000gp so that his domain can have a class V urban settlement; it currently has 400 orc urban families. Raknar’s monthly revenue is {[ 1,250 x (6 + 4 + 2)] + [1,250 x (3 + 4 + 2)]} from his peasant families and (400 x 7) from his urban families, for a total of 15,000gp + 11,250gp + 2,800gp = 29,050gp. Now that he rules a transitional domain, Raknar can conscript troops, levy militia, and accept ordinary vassals without a morale penalty, but can no longer directly call on clanhold warriors

A transitional domain can be converted to an ordinary domain once it has been a transitional domain for at least 20 years.

###### Dwarven Vaults

A dwarf of 9th level and above will soon attract dwarven followers appropriate to his class as well as a number of dwarven peasant families when he claims or constructs a vault. A dwarf of below 9th level who claims or construct a vault will attract followers and peasants when he attains 9th level.

A vault is a special stronghold built underground. While it may include above-ground gates, walls, or structures as necessary for defense or commerce, these cannot constitute more than 25% of the gp value of the stronghold. Any above-ground structures must be of earth or stone. A vault can only be constructed within the territory of a dwarven realm or in unclaimed wilderness territory. A stronghold built in human or elven territory, or built above ground, does not qualify.

Dwarves have a martial tradition in which many of the menfolk serve in a militia. Vault rulers can call up to 2gp per family of trained militia, which arrive equipped as light infantry (see p. XX). If they need additional troops, however, vault rulers can only garrison their domains with dwarven troops. They can hire and deploy human or elven troops but those troops do not count for the domain’s morale score.

Dwarven vaults otherwise function like human strongholds for all other purposes. Players and Judges interested in robust rules for dwarven mining, mushroom farming, eldermoots, and other mechanics should consult ***By This Axe: The Cyclopedia of Dwarven Civilization***.The domain rules in that book are 100% compatible with those of ***ACKS II***.

###### Elven Fastnesses

An elf of 9th level and above will soon attract elven followers appropriate to his class as well as a number of elven peasant families when he claims or constructs a fastness. An elf of below 9th level who claims or construct a fastness will attract followers and peasants when he attains 9th level.

A fastness is a special stronghold built harmoniously within a site of natural majesty. Fastnesses might be erected at the summit of a great peak, in the branches of a mighty tree, or behind a towering waterfall, but not at the foot of medium-sized hill in an unimpressive scrubland. A fastness can only be constructed within the territory of an existing elven realm or in unclaimed wilderness territory. A stronghold built in human or dwarven territory, or built at a site lacking suitable majesty, does not qualify.

The advantage of a fastness is that it brings the elves who dwell there into closer harmony with nature. All ordinary animals within 3 miles of the fastness (i.e. in its 6-mile hex) will be friendly to the elven residents. The elves will be able to communicate with the animals as if affected by *speak with beasts*, and the animals will warn of approaching strangers, carry news of events, deliver short messages to nearby places, etc. As a result, spies and thieves operating against the domain suffer a -2 penalty to their proficiency throws (see **Hijinks**,below). However, in exchange for this assistance, an elven ruler must always defend the animals within this territory.

The long lifespan of the elves gives many adults an opportunity to pursue military training. Fastness rulers can call up to 2gp per family of trained militia, which arrive equipped as light infantry (see p. XX). If they need additional troops, however, fastness rulers can only garrison their domains with elven troops. If they use any dwarven or human troops to garrison it, they lose the friendship of the local wildlife until they cease doing so. Fastness rulers can freely use mercenaries of any race for offensive operations outside the domain, and can hire and retain specialists and henchmen of any race. Elven fastnesses are otherwise maintained like human domains.

## Politics and Power

Whether it be the Athenian Council of 500, the Senate of Rome, or the Great Council of the Serene Republic of Venice, many of history’s greatest realms have been advised or ruled by deliberative bodies drawn from the aristocratic classes. In ***ACKS II***these bodies are referred to as **senates**, and a realm with a senate is called a **senatorial republic** or just a **republic.**

Senatorial republics have certain advantages over other types of realms, but suffer certain disadvantages as well. Using these rules, adventurers can seek to influence the policies of leading senators, get elected as senators, become rulers of senatorial republics, or even establish senatorial republics of their own. They can, in short, participate in politics and accumulate the power that goes with it. Except where otherwise noted, all rules for domains apply to a senatorial republic.

### Benefits of a Senate

A senatorial republic gains the following advantages over other realms:

* Each domain in the realm gains a permanent +1 bonus to its base morale score. Realms with senates tend to inspire more patriotism and have more stability.
* Non-henchmen assigned to rule vassal domains within the realm have base loyalty scores of 0 instead of -2. A senatorial republic commands loyalty to its senate even if not every member of the government is personally loyal to the current ruler.
* The first extra duty demanded (e.g. build additional stronghold, call to arms, tax demanded, or loan demanded) each month does not trigger a Henchman loyalty check, provided the demand is approved by the Senate. Thus rulers of Republics can demand two duties of their henchman vassals and one duty of their non-henchman vassals, without needing to offer favors or risking a Henchman Loyalty check.
* Levying militia from the realm does not reduce the morale of the realm, provided the levy is approved by the senate. Senatorial republics often pride themselves on their citizen-soldiers.

### Restrictions of a Senate

A senatorial republic has the following restrictions:

* The ruler must consult the senate before invading another realm.
* The ruler must consult the senate before demanding a duty from any vassals.
* The ruler must consult the senate when appointing a new character to manage a vassal domain.
* The ruler must consult the senate before changing the republic’s taxes.
* The ruler must consult the senate before changing the republic’s religion.
* The ruler must consult the senate before levying conscripts or militia from the republic.

Particular senatorial republics may have different restrictions, but these are typical of all. See **Consulting the Senate**, below, for the applicable rules.

If a ruler does not consult the senate when required to do so, or enacts a policy that the senate voted against, then the realm is in **dispute** and temporarily loses all of the benefits of being a senatorial republic. See **Disputes with the Senate**, below.

### Establishing a Senatorial republic

A senatorial republic can be established in one of two ways.

* The ruler of an existing realm can establish a senate to advise him. In this case, the ruler will continue to rule his realm, subject to the restrictions imposed by the new senate.
* Several independent rulers can merge their realms together into one larger realm, establishing a senate as the new realm’s governing body. In this case, the first action of the new senate will be to appoint a character as the new senatorial republic’s ruler. The new ruler will manage the realm subject to the restrictions of the senate. Realms where the ruler is chosen by the senate are often referred to as **republics** and their rulers bear titles such as consul, prime minister, or doge.

Rules for construction of senates are provided below.

###### Constructing A Senate

The following guidelines are offered to help players and Judges establish senatorial republics.

1. Determine the **size of the senate**. This could range from as few as a dozen to over 2,000 senatorial seats. Larger realms typically have larger senates.
2. Determine the **requirements of office**. Requirements might be a minimum level of experience, a title, a wealth threshold, or a property holding. Write down a few sentences about how senators are selected and what powers they hold.
3. Determine the number of **leading senators** in the senate. (Leading senators are named NPCs with whom the adventurers interact. Other senators are called **minor senators**.) For each leading senator, the Judge should generate the following characteristics: alignment; class; level; Intellect, Will, and Charisma; and proficiencies.
4. Assign each leading senator 1d3 **policy objectives** which he aims to achieve while in office. A list of random policy objectives is provided below.
5. Assign each leading senator an **influence value**, which is the number of votes that the senator controls. If the number of votes controlled by all leading senators is less than the number of senatorial seats, the remaining votes are held by **independent minor senators**. If the number of votes controlled is greater than the number of senatorial seats, reduce the number of leading senators, starting with the least influential.
6. Group leading senators with compatible policy objectives together to create **political factions**. Historically, a common configuration has been two opposed factions, such as the Optimates and Populares in the Roman Republic and the Blues and Greens in the Byzantine Empire. Judges who prefer more complexity can, of course, have additional factions. Write down a few sentences about the platform of each faction.
7. Total up to the influence of the leading senators in each faction. If one faction has a majority of influence, it is the **ruling faction**. Otherwise, the faction with the most influence is the **leading faction**.

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Realm Population | Minimum Size | Maximum Size |
| Less than 4,600 | 4 seats | 15 seats |
| 4,600 – 52,000 | 4 seats | 50 seats |
| 53,000 – 363,000 | 16 seats | 225 seats |
| 364,000 – 1,499,000 | 51 seats | 1,500 seats |
| 1,500,001 or more | 225 seats | 6,000 seats |

**Size of the Senate:** The size of a senate is measured in **senatorial seats**. A senate must be large enough to attend to the business of the realm, but not so large that it becomes dysfunctional. The Size of the Senate table, to the right, shows the minimum and maximum size based on the number of families populating the realm.

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Senatorial Seats | Minimum Senator Level | Leading Senators | Influence per Senator |
| 4 – 15 | Ruler’s Level -1 | 1d4 | 2d3 votes |
| 16 –50 | Ruler’s Level -3 | 2d6 | 2d6 votes |
| 51 – 225 | Ruler’s Level -5 | 2d6+3 | 2d6x3 votes |
| 226 – 1,500 | Ruler’s Level -7 | 3d6+2 | 2d10x5 votes |
| 1,501 or more | Ruler’s Level -9 | 4d6+1 | 2d10x20 votes |

The larger a senate, the easier it is to qualify for, and the harder it is for a small number of senators to dominate it. The Senate Characteristics table summarizes these factors.

EXAMPLE: The Auran Empire has a population of 4.3 million families. Its senate must have between 225 and 6,000 seats. The Judge decides it has a senate of 600 seats. The Empire is ruled by a 14th level ruler, so the minimum senator level will be (14-7) 7, and there will be 3d6+2 leading senators. Rolling 3d6+2, the Judge gets a total of 11, so there are 11 leading senators. He rolls 2d8 for the number of votes controlled by each senator, getting 35, 45, 55, 20, 75, 60, 10, 75, 40, 85, and 50 votes, for a total of 550 votes. 50 votes are held by independent minor senators.

**Requirements of Office:** By cross-referencing the level of the realm ruler with the size of the senate, the Judge can determine the minimum level to hold the office of senator. The Judge can use level of experience as the requirement for senator if desired. However, a character’s level of experience is a game mechanic of which the inhabitants of the game world are only indirectly aware; a better option is to impose a requirement such as title, net worth, land owned, or families governed. The Requirements of Office has recommendations for each level, from which the Judge should select a few criteria. The Bribe column is used to determine the cost to bribe a senator (see below).

|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Required Level | Required Title | Required Net Worth | Required Land | Required Families | Bribe (day/week/month/year) |
| 3 | Baron | 5,000gp | 5 1.5m hexes | 40 families | 4gp/25gp/100gp/1,200gp |

EXAMPLE: As a 600-seat body under a 14th level ruler, the Auran senate is open to 7th level characters and above. The Judge decides that in the game world, the senate is open to characters who hold the title of Legate (count) or above and manage realms with at least 550 families.

**Policy Objectives:** The Policy Objectives table can be used to randomly determine goals for the leading senators. Re-roll conflicting results. The Judge should interpret the policy objectives in light of the his campaign.

EXAMPLE: Senator Ulrand Valerian is being assigned 1d3 policy objectives. The Judge rolls for 3 policy goals and gets an 11, 15, and 16. He interprets these goals in light of Valerian’s position as a highly Lawful traditionalist serving as a legate on the borderlands. Valerian has a policy objective of strengthening the border forts along the Krysivor River because he fears the coming beastman invasion. He wants to re-distribute land from the nobility to the peasants in the civilized areas because he believes the Empire can only recover if it returns to its foundation of independent citizen-farmers. He wants to spread the faith of the realm because he believes that the Chthonic gods are subverting the Empire, its laws, and its patriotism.

A senator’s influence and policy objectives are secret until revealed in play.

**Senates Established by Adventurers:** An adventurer who establishes a senate only performs step 1 (determine the size of the senate) and step 2 (determine the requirements for office). He can then appoint qualified senators as desired. Normally these will be the adventurer’s friends, henchman, and vassals, and/or henchman of the same. A ruler who establishes a senate begins with very strong influence over it. For the first 1d6 months after the senate is established, all its senators will vote for the ruler’s policies.

Politics is unpredictable, however, and yesterday’s trusted right-hand man can be tomorrow’s rival. 1d6 months after the adventurer has established his senate, the Judge should randomly determine how many leading senators emerge as influential within the senate. The Judge should then select leading senators from among the NPCs appointed by the adventurer, giving more weight to NPCs that have high INT, WIL, CHA, class level, and relevant proficiencies such as Command, Diplomacy, Leadership, Military Strategy, and Mystic Aura. The Judge should then choose or roll for policy objectives and influence for the senate’s new leaders, and create political factions guided by these results.

###### Consulting the Senate

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Senate Voting** | |
| **Adjusted Die Roll** | **Result** |
| 2- | Votes Against and Condemns Ruler’s Policy |
| 3 – 5 | Votes Against Ruler’s Policy |
| 6 – 8 | Votes With Current Trend |
| 9 – 11 | Vote For Ruler’s Policy |
| 12+ | Votes For and Endorses Ruler’s Policy |

When a ruler seeks the senate’s support for a policy, he must **consult the senate**. When a ruler consults the senate, the Judge should roll 2d6 on the Senate Voting table for each leading senator to see if the senator votes for or against the ruler’s policy. A senator that is **bewitched** will always vote however the character who has bewitched him directs.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Condition** | **Voting Roll Adjustment** |
| Ruler’s current Domain Morale score | + Domain Morale score |
| Ruler does not have Diplomacy | -2 |
| Ruler has Mystic Aura | +1 |
| Ruler is Lawful and has never been implicated in bribery, etc. | +1 |
| Senator is henchman of ruler, or of ruler’s henchman | +5 |
| Senator and ruler are in same political faction | +1 |
| Senator and ruler are in opposed political factions | -2 |
| Other senator from same faction has endorsed ruler | +1 per endorsement |
| Other senator from same faction has condemned ruler | -1 per condemnation |
| Ruler’s proposed policy helps senator’s policy objective | +1 per objective |
| Ruler’s proposed policy hinders senator’s policy objective | -2 per objective |
| Senator has been bribed by ruler | +1/+2/+3 |
| Senator has been bribed by ruler’s rivals | -1/-2/-3 |
| Senator has been intimidated or seduced by ruler | +1 |
| Senator previously but no longer bewitched, intimidated or seduced by ruler | -5 |
| Senator has been intimidated or seduced by ruler’s rivals | -1 |
| Senator previously but no longer bewitched, intim., or seduced by ruler’s rivals | +1 |
| Senator owes ruler for prior favor | +1 per favor |
| One-third or more of realm’s military loyal to ruler | +1 |
| All of realm’s military loyal to ruler | +2 |

A result of “Votes Against and Condemns Petition” means that the senator votes against the petition while giving a rousing condemnation of the petition and the petitioner, which will influence future votes by members of his faction. A result of “Votes Against Petition” means the senator votes against the petition but does not urge others to do so.

A result of “Votes with Current Trend” means the senator votes for the petition if more votes have so far been cast for the petition, and votes against the petition if more votes have so far been cast against the petition. If no votes have been cast for or against yet, the senator abstains.

A result of “Votes For Petition” means the senator votes for the petition but does not urge others to do so. Finally, a result of “Votes For and Endorses Petition” means that the senator votes for the petition and gives an inspiring speech supporting the petition and petitioner which will influence future votes by members of his faction.

Voting is not simultaneous. Instead, voting rolls are conducted in order starting with the most influential senator and continue until a majority of the senators have voted either in favor or against the ruler’s policy. Remember that a leading senator’s vote carries a number of votes equal to the senator’s influence. (These other, less influential senators are assumed to vote “off camera”).

###### Voting Roll Adjustments

To reflect circumstances that may affect the senator’s vote, apply the Voting Roll adjustments shown, based on the ruler, the senator voting, and the policy being discussed.

**Political Factions**: A ruler may choose to align himself with a political faction in the senate. Doing so earns him a +1 bonus to the voting rolls of all senators of the same faction but a -2 penalty to the voting rolls of all senators in opposed factions.

**Bribery:** Rulers may bribe senators prior to a vote in order to ensure a more favorable outcome. Any character can bribe but those with Bribery proficiency are better at it. Proficient characters with Briber proficiency gain a +1 bonus from a day’s income, +2 from a week’s, and +3 from a month’s. Non-proficient characters proficiency gain a +1 bonus from a week’s income, +2 from a month’s, and +3 from a year’s. On an unmodified voting roll result of 2, a bribed senator will reveal that the ruler bribed him. At the Judge’s discretion, a ruler’s rivals may bribe senators to vote against the ruler.

**Intimidation:** Rulers may intimidate senators prior to the vote in order to ensure a more favorable outcome. The character must have the Intimidation proficiency, be in a position to implicitly or explicitly threaten the senator, and grossly outrank or outnumber him. However, if a senator who was previously intimidated by the ruler is able to escape his dominance, a -5 penalty applies instead of a +1 bonus. On an unmodified voting roll result of 2, an intimidated senator will reveal that the ruler intimidated him. At the Judge’s discretion, a ruler’s rivals may intimidate senators to vote against the ruler.

**Seduction:** Petitioners may seduce senators who are potentially attracted to them. The character must have Seduction proficiency and be in a position to entice or allure the senator. However, if a senator was previously seduced by a petitioner and thereafter not well-treated, a -5 penalty applies instead of a +1 bonus. On an unmodified voting roll result of 2, a seduced senator will reveal that the ruler seduced him. At the Judge’s discretion, a ruler’s rivals may seduce senators to vote against the ruler.

**Military Loyalty:** Divisions of troops that are led by the ruler, or by the ruler’s henchmen, count as personally loyal to the ruler. Divisions of troops led by non-henchmen or mercenary commanders do not.

###### Voting Rolls by Faction

If the adventurers have not spent time building relationships with the leading senators, then the Judge can resolve a senate consultation by rolling once for each political faction instead of for each leading senator. Follow the rules above, but only apply voting roll adjustments which are applicable to the ruler and the faction as a whole.

### Disputes with the Senate

If a ruler does not consult the senate when required to do so, or enacts a policy that the senate voted against, then the realm is in **dispute**. A realm in dispute temporarily loses all of the benefits of being a senatorial republic. The benefits are restored if the ruler successfully regains the approval of the senate.

In order to regain the approval of the senate, the ruler must consult the senate with a policy proposal to retroactively approve of his recent action(s). The Judge should roll on the Senate Voting table for each leading senator to see if the senator votes for or against the ruler. If a majority of the senators vote for the ruler, then the dispute ends. If the majority of the senators vote against the ruler, the dispute continues, and any senator who voted against the ruler gains the policy objective “replace realm ruler with new ruler.” The ruler may try to regain the approval of the senate repeatedly if desired but doing so will become harder and harder as more senators become committed to ending his reign.

If the ruler cannot or does not want to regain the approval of the senate, he may simply abandon senatorial government, either formally (dissolving the senate) or informally (ignoring it). In either case, abandoning senatorial government has the following effects:

* The realm permanently loses all of the benefits of being a senatorial republic.
* The ruler’s personal domain must makes its next domain morale roll at a -2 penalty.
* If any of the ruler’s henchmen are senators, they must immediately make loyalty rolls at a -2 penalty.
* If any of the ruler’s vassals are not henchmen, they must immediately make loyalty rolls at a -2 penalty. This penalty is in addition to the base -2 morale of non-vassal henchmen.
* Any influential senators with the policy objective “replace realm with new ruler” will become Hostile, and work against the ruler to the extent possible, using methods such as assassination, ritual magic, war, etc.

Assuming the ruler survives the turmoil that ensues, he may thereafter rule his realm without a senate. He may establish a new senate after 2d6 months, if desired.

### Senatorial Shenanigans

Adventurers with ruffians hired or running a syndicate can order hijinks to gather intelligence on, and influence over, the senate. The following hijinks are particularly useful when dealing with senatorial politics:

* Assassination: Perpetrators can be assigned to assassinate senators.
* Carousing: Perpetrators can be told to seek out political rumors.
* Slandering: Perpetrators can be told to spread lies and rumors.
* Spying: Perpetrators can be assigned to spy on specific senators.

Complete rules on syndicates, perpetrators, and hijinks are explained in **Hideouts and** **Hijinks**, p. XX – XX.

### Gaining Influence

Adventurers who are rulers or senators themselves might seek to gain influence over independent minor senators. An independent minor senator will vote as directed by the adventurer if any of the following applies:

* The minor senator has been **bewitched** by the adventurer.
* The minor senator is a henchman of the adventurer.
* The minor senator has received gifts his month from the adventurer sufficient to provide a +3 bonus on reaction rolls from a bribe.
* The minor senator has Friendly reactions with the adventurer andhas received gifts this month from the adventurer sufficient to provide a +1 bonus to reaction rolls from a bribe.

If two or more characters provide gifts (or bribes) to the same minor senator in the same month, the senator is considered to favor whichever gift-giver offered more. If the value of the gifts is the same, the senator favors whichever gift-giver he has better reactions with currently. If the senator’s reactions are also the same with both gift-givers, the gifts have no effect.

### Politics Is Just War Continued By Other Means

This system is purposefully open to terrible amounts of skullduggery. Adventurers and their opponents can bewitch, bribe, intimidate, and seduce senators; assassinate or kidnap senators so they cannot vote; defame and blackmail their political opponents; and generally do all of the awful and ruthless things that historical politicians have done. It is up to the Judge to determine how much of the campaign should be set aside for “politicking”. Bribery, intimidation, etc. can be extensively role-played or resolved quickly with die rolls, depending on the interests of the Judge and players.

## Hideouts and Hijinks

Assassins, nightblades, and thieves can build secret strongholds called **hideouts**. (Venturers can build guildhouses, which can function as hideouts of one-half their value; see p. XX). Being secret, hideouts do not secure domains and do not attract peasant families. Instead, hideouts are used to operate **syndicates** of organized crime and commerce. The head of a syndicate is called a **boss** and is analogous to the ruler of a domain. In certain corrupt and plutocratic regions, a syndicate boss might actually bea domain ruler, but in most areas, boss operate their syndicates within domains ruled by more “legitimate” authorities.

### Building a Hideout

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Hideout Size, Cost, and Level** | | | |
| **Market**  **Class** | **Max. Syndicate**  **Membership** | **Minimum**  **Hideout Value (gp)** | **Max. Effective**  **Level** |
| Class VI | 25 | 5,000 | 3rd |
| Class V | 50 | 10,000 | 5th |
| Class IV | 100 | 20,000 | 7th |
| Class III | 375 | 75,000 | 9th |
| Class II | 750 | 150,000 | 11th |
| Class I | 3,000 | 600,000 | 14th |

Hideouts must be built within 6 miles of an urban settlement, which becomes the syndicate’s base of operations. The market class of the urban settlement determines the maximum size of the syndicate. Large ports and cosmopolitan cities can sustain much larger criminal gangs. However, in order to reach its maximum size, a syndicate’s boss must construct a sufficiently large hideout. The Hideout Size, Cost, and Level table shows the maximum syndicate membership by settlement class and the required hideout cost to reach that size of membership.

EXAMPLE: Viktir establishes a hideout in the town of Siadanos, a class IV market. Initially, he spends 10,000gp on his hideout. Based on the value of his hideout, the maximum membership of his syndicate is 50. Later, he spends another 10,000gp on his hideout, increasing its value to 20,000gp. The maximum membership of his syndicate rises to 100. The year following, he expands his hideout to a 75,000gp mansion. However, the maximum membership of his syndicate does not increase, because a Class IV market can only sustain a 100-member syndicate.

### Establishing a Syndicate

Just having a big hideout does not mean anyone works there. Cunning, ruthless, and/or impatient adventurers might take over a pre-existing syndicate from its prior boss, rather than establish their own. This is a very risky, though possibly very rewarding, path. See **Change in Management**, below, for rules on taking over a pre-existing syndicate.

Because of the great risk of a takeover, most bosses prefer to establish their own syndicate. To do so, the boss must find and hire ruffians to join his syndicate. If of 9th level or above, the boss will automatically attract 2d6 1st level followers to his service when he establishes his hideout. Once the followers arrive, they can begin to be assigned **hijinks** (discussed below).

In addition to or instead of followers, the syndicate boss can also recruit ruffians from the urban settlement to staff his syndicate. However, there’s a catch. While most ruffians are happy to do a gig for pay, far fewer ruffians are interested in leaving their current syndicate to join a new one — only the desperate or disgruntled. Therefore, when recruiting ruffians from a settlement with an existing syndicate, the urban settlement count as one market class smaller (if already Class VI, reduce available ruffians by half). A boss who wishes to be more aggressive in hiring can do so, but then must follow the rules in Change in Management when recruiting them. See the **Hirelings**, **Henchmen**, **Mercenaries**, **and Specialists** rules on p. XX for details on ruffians.

Once a member joins the syndicate, he is assumed to remain a member until he is executed or fired or until he betrays the boss due to a failed loyalty roll. Over time, some members would age out, retire to start families, put crime behind them, and so on, but for playability’s sake the Judge should assume that the total number and level of the syndicate’s members stays the same except if the boss gains or loses members from actual play.

### Assigning, Planning, and Perpetrating Hijinks

Once an adventurer has established a syndicate, he can begin to assign hijinks to its members. Some hijinks require planning before they are performed, and some hijinks require laying low after they are performed in order to avoid being caught. Planning, performing, and laying low after a hijink generally require about a month in total.

A character undertaking a hijink is called a **perpetrator.** Only characters with the Streetwise proficiency can perpetrate hijinks. Perpetrators resolve their hijinks with proficiency throws (or in some cases attack throws). If the throw succeeds, the hijink succeeds. If the throw fails, the hijinks fails. If the throw fails by 14 or more or is an unmodified 1, the perpetrator gets caught.

The Hijinks by Type table, below, shows the available hijinks, the proficiency throw required to accomplish the hijink, and the outcome of a successful throw. These are discussed in more detail in the next section. Some hijinks, such as assassination and kidnapping, set the level of the target by referencing the level of the perpetrator. Other hijinks, such as stealing, offer rewards that scale with the perpetrator’s level. 0th level perpetrators count as 1st level for purposes of reward.

A perpetrator whose class level is higher than the maximum effective level permitted by the market class he is in must use the maximum effective level to determine the level of his target and the amount of earnings. The perpetrator still uses his class level for calculating his throw values.

Viktir is a 9th level thief. He is in a small village near the Krysivor River with only about 100 urban families (Class VI market). He decides to earn some money by perpetrating a kidnapping hijink. Normally, as a 9th level thief Viktir would kidnap targets of between 7th and 11th level, earning 3500gp – 5500gp. In a Class VI market, however, the maximum effective level is 3rd, so Viktir can only kidnap someone of 1st to 5th level.

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Hijink | Requirement | Successful Outcome |
| Arson\* | Sneaking | Burn down 4d6 x 10 shp of buildings per perpetrator level |
| Assassinating\* | Hiding | Victim dies; bounty of 1,000gp per level of victim to boss |
| Carousing | Listening | Learn one rumor worth 3d12 x 5gp per perpetrator level to boss |
| Escaping\* | Lockpicking | Escape from prison |
| Infiltrating\* | Hiding | Infiltrate enemy army or stronghold to perform future hijinks |
| Kidnapping\* | Hiding | Victim abducted; ransom of 500gp per level of victim to boss |
| Racketeering | Attack AC 6 | Extract 100gp in coin and goods per level of perpetrator; payout of 60% of value to boss |
| Sabotaging\* | Sneaking | Destroy 1,000gp of supplies in a stronghold per perpetrator level |
| Slandering | Listening | Victim loses control of one minor senator per perpetrator level |
| Smuggling\* | Sneaking | Smuggle goods worth 3000gp per perpetrator level, payout of 12% of value of goods to boss |
| Soliciting | Listening | Earn 3d12 x 5gp per level of perpetrator for boss |
| Spying | Hiding | Gain evidence of one secret worth 2d12 x 100gp per level of perpetrator to boss |
| Stealing\* | Pickpocketing | Steal goods worth 600gp per perpetrator level, payout of 60% of value of goods to boss |
| Subverting\* | Lockpicking | Create breach in a stronghold |
| Treasure-Hunting | Searching | Find treasure map to hoard worth 1d6 x 1,000gp per level of perpetrator to boss |
| Hijinks marked \* require 2d8+3 days of planning and 1 day to perform. Other hijinks require 3d6+10 days to perform. | | |

###### Assigning Hijinks

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Monthly Member Tribute** | |
| **Syndicate**  **Member Level** | **Monthly**  **Tribute (gp)** |
| 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 5 |
| 2 | 30 |
| 3 | 200 |
| 4 | 425 |
| 5 | 650 |
| 6 | 835 |
| 7 | 1,500 |
| 8 | 2,000 |

The boss of a syndicate can assign hijinks to none, some, or all of the members of his syndicate. By custom, a boss may only assign one hijink to each member per month, and must leave the deadline for its completion that month up to the perpetrator. A boss can order a member to undertake additional hijinks or operate on a tight deadline, but doing so triggers a loyalty roll by the member; due to the time required to plan, perform, and lay low, the perpetration of multiple or rushed hijinks places the member at great risk. The boss who controls the syndicate gets the benefit of any successful hijinks he orders.

A boss can perform hijinks himself, if desired. A character without a hideout can perform hijinks independently, as if he were his own boss, though he might anger the local syndicates.

Each time a boss orders a hijink, he must pay a fee to the member he orders. The fee is 6gp for a 0th level member, or one month’s henchman wages for a 1st level or higher member. For instance, a 1st level thief must be paid 25gp to undertake a hijink, while a 4th level assassin must be paid 200gp. (Note that is much less than the amount an ordinary adventurer must pay to hire ruffians. When adventurers hire ruffians, the ruffians they hire still have to pay their boss his cut, so they pass that cost on to the adventurer. The adventurer pays the henchmen wage + the tribute).

Assigning hijinks takes time. Arranging bribes, making payoffs, holding secret meetings with fixers and fences, recording assignments in the syndicate’s ledger and so on all add up! The boss can assign up to 12 hijinks as an ancillary activity or 100 hijinks as a dedicated activity. If the boss has more than 100 members in his syndicate, it would take him several days to assign hijinks every month. Assigning hijinks to a 3,000-member syndicate would keep its boss busy every day of the month.

Fortunately, a syndicate member who is not assigned a hijink by his boss receives no wages that month and still earns money for his boss, paying a tribute from his own earnings. The amount of tribute paid based on the member’s level, as shown on the Monthly Member Tribute table. Members whose level exceeds the maximum effective level for their market pay tribute based on the maximum effective level.

EXAMPLE: Viktir’s syndicate currently has 50 0th level members, 30 1st level members, 15 2nd level members, and 5 3rd level members. Viktir doesn’t order any hijinks this month. He just collects (50 x 1gp) + (30 x 5gp) + (15 x 30) + (5 x 200) = 1,650gp in tribute from his members.

**Designer’s Note:** The Monthly Member Tribute has been carefully tuned so that, on average, it is equal to the amount of profit the boss earns from ordering a hijink, taking into account all the relevant factors such a cost of wages and chance of imprisonment. Therefore, if the player or the Judge are not interested in the details of syndicate administration, the boss can just sit back and collect his ill-gotten gains each month without having to roll a lot of dice or track a lot of income and expenses. It’s entirely up to each gaming group to decide how much they want to focus on campaign activities.

###### Planning Hijinks

Arson, assassinating, escaping, infiltrating, kidnapping, sabotaging, smuggling, subverting, and stealing hijinks require planning to avoid penalties to the hijink throw. Any character can plan a hijink if he has the appropriate thief skill necessary to perform the hijink. Planning a hijink is an ongoing ancillary activity that requires 2d8+3 days to complete. Perpetrators (classed characters with the relevant thief skill) of 5th level or higher can plan a hijink in 2d6+3 days, and those of 9th level or higher can plan a hijink in 2d4 + 3 days. During this time, the perpetrator is recruiting conspirators, establishing an alibi, profiling the target, casing the venue, etc. Due to the number of “unknown unknowns” involved in a hijink, a perpetrator will never know how much time is required to plan a hijink until he has completed the planning. If a perpetrator performs the hijink before completing planning, he suffers a penalty of -1 to his proficiency throw per day of planning left uncomplete. The penalty is revealed when the die roll is made. A hijink can be planned on behalf of another perpetrator. Hijinks other than those listed above neither require nor benefit from planning.

EXAMPLE: Viktir, a 9th level thief, wants to assassinate the depraved palatine of Arganos to avenge the many thieves the palatine has tortured to death. An assassination hijink requires planning to avoid penalties, so Viktir performs the plan hijink activity. The Judge rolls 2d4 + 3 days and secretly determines it will take Viktir 8 days to complete the planning. However, after 5 days, Viktir’s’ comrades tell him that they need to depart for an adventure. Knowing his planning is incomplete, though not sure by how much, Viktir nevertheless decides to perform the hijink. When he makes the hijink’s proficiency throw, he discovers he has incurred a (5 – 8) -3 penalty.

###### Perpetrating Hijinks

Any character with the appropriate thief skill can perpetrate a hijink. Hijinks that must be planned (arson, assassinating, escaping, infiltrating, kidnapping, sabotaging, smuggling, subverting, and stealing hijinks) are singular dedicated activities which require 1 day. Other hijinks (carousing, racketeering, slandering, soliciting, spying, and treasure hunting) are ongoing dedicated activities requiring 3d6 + 10 days to complete. Perpetrators of 5th level or above can perpetrate an ongoing hijink in 3d4+8 days, and those of 9th level or above can do so in 2d6 + 5 days. When the activity is complete, the perpetrator makes his hijink throw. A perpetrator will never know how much time is required to perform an ongoing hijink until they have completed the hijink. If a perpetrator rushes the hijink, he suffers a penalty of -1 to his proficiency throw per day of activity left uncomplete. The penalty is revealed when the die roll is made.

EXAMPLE: Reingo the Ruthless, a 1st level thief, decides to carouse in the town of Cyfaraun. As a 1st level thief, performing the carousing hijink will be an ongoing dedicated activity for him for 3d6 + 10 days. The Judge rolls the dice and determines it will require 21 days to complete the hijink. After 21 days, Reingo makes his Hear Noise proficiency throw. Had he gotten impatient and decided to throw after 17 days, Reingo would have suffered a penalty of (17 – 21) -4.

###### Laying Low

After performing an arson, assassinating, escaping, infiltrating, kidnapping, sabotaging, smuggling, subversion, or stealing hijink, a perpetrator must lay low, avoiding drawing any attention to himself or his misdeeds. Laying low is an ongoing ancillary activity requiring 2d8 + 3 days to complete. A character cannot plan or perform any additional hijinks in the same base of operations during this time. (He may plan or perform hijinks in other bases of operations.) A character will never know how long it will take for “the heat to die down” until they have completed laying low. If a perpetrator does not lay low, then he is much more likely to be caught on his next hijink in that base of operations: If the proficiency throw fails by 11 or more or is an unmodified 1 – 3, the perpetrator will be caught. Hijinks other than those listed above do not require laying low.

|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Perpetrator Level | Planning Hijink | Performing Hijink — Planned | Performing Hijink — Ongoing | Laying Low |
| 1st – 4th | 2d8 + 3 days | 1 day | 3d6 + 10 days | 2d8 + 3 days |
| 5th – 8th | 2d6 + 3 days | 1 day | 3d4 + 8 days | 2d8 + 3 days |
| 9th+ | 2d4 + 3 days | 1 day | 2d6 + 5 days | 2d8 + 3 days |

###### Hijinks by Crews

Two or more perpetrators can form a **crew** to perform a hijink together. The members of the crew do not have to be of the same class or level, but all must be capable of performing the hijink in question. The highest-level perpetrator in the crew is the **honcho**.(If two or more are the same level, the perpetrator with the highest CHA is the honcho.)The number of crew members can be equal to the honcho’s number of henchmen slots. Any extra crew members thereafter impose a -1 penalty each on the proficiency throw.

All members of the crew must plan (if necessary) and perform the heist together. The time required to plan the heist (if any) and perform it is rolled once for the whole crew, using the level of the honcho. A high-level honcho can thus help low-level perpetrators plan and perform hijinks more swiftly. Crews do not remain together while laying low and roll separately.

When performing the hijink, all members of the crew each make a separate proficiency throw for the same hijink. If at least one of the crew succeeds on the throw, the hijink is considered a success and its outcome occurs – the target is assassinated, goods are stolen, etc. For hijinks with variable outcomes based on perpetrator level, add up the class levels of all of the perpetrators who succeeded and use that as the perpetrator level. However, if any member of the crew is caught, that perpetrator and all other perpetrators who didn’t succeed on the throw are caught. It is possible for a hijink to both be successful and to result in some perpetrators being caught. The GP and XP earned from the hijink is split pro rata by level among all the perpetrators who don’t get caught.

EXAMPLE: Viktir (9th level thief), Gordon (6th level freebooter), Bingo (1st level thief), and Reingo (1st level thief) form a crew to perform a stealing hijink. As the highest level crew member, Viktir is the honcho. Viktir’s CHA is 13 so his crew could safely have up to 5 members; at 4 members there’s no penalty. A stealing hijink requires planning. If Bingo or Reingo were attempting the hijink alone it would take them 2d8 + 3 days, but because the honcho Viktir is 9th level, it only takes 2d4+3 days to plan the hijink. The Judge secretly throws the dice and rolls an 8. After 8 days of planning, the crew performs the hijink.

Performing a stealing hijink requires 1 day. Each member of the crew makes a proficiency throw to Pick Pockets. Viktir needs 6+ and rolls a 16, a success. Gordon needs 12+ and rolls a 13, a success. Bingo needs 17+ and rolls an 11, a failure. Reingo needs 17+ and rolls a 3, a failure by 14 points. Since Reingo failed by 14 points, he’s been caught and since Bingo also failed, he’s unfortunately caught too. Since Viktir and Gordon both succeeded, they stole 300gp of merchandise per level. They add their levels together to determine the effective perpetrator level, meaning they stole [ (9 + 6) x 300] 4,500gp of merchandise! The pair split the loot pro rata by level, with Viktir getting (9 / 15 x 4,500gp) 2,700gp and Gordon getting (6 / 15 x 30) 1,800gp. (If the crew had been assembled and paid by a syndicate boss, then the boss would get the loot, of course.)

###### Hasty Hijinks

The following hijinks can be performed hastily: carousing, racketeering, soliciting. A hasty hijink is a dedicated activity that requires 1d6 + 3 days (1d4 + 3 at 5th level and 1d3 + 2 at 9th level). There is no penalty to the hijink’s proficiency throw. However, if the throw succeeds the outcome is much less valuable (see the List of Hijinks section for details). Conversely, if a hasty hijink’s proficiency throw fails by 14 or more or is an unmodified 1, the perpetrator isn’t necessarily caught. Throw the die again; the perpetrator is caught only if the second throw fails. Hasty hijinks cannot be performed by crews as they’re not complex enough to benefit from a coordinated scheme.

### List of Hijinks

Some proficiencies grant a special bonus (separate from their usual effects) when performing hijinks. For NPC ruffians without specific proficiencies, assume no such bonus at 0th to 4th level, a +1 bonus from 5th to 8th level and +2 bonus from 9th level on. NPCs still gain any bonus due to class powers (e.g. Listening).

###### Arson

Arson is the intentional ignition of fires in order to destroy structures. For an arson to succeed, the perpetrator must first make a successful Sneaking throw. However, for each of the following proficiencies the perpetrator knows, he gains a special +1 bonus on his throw to commit arson: Engineering, Siege Engineering, Survival. Skulking proficiency grants the usual +2 bonus.

If the proficiency throw succeeds, the perpetrator deals 4d6 x 10 structural fire damage per class level to a structure of his choice. The perpetrator can set a larger fire by taking a -1 penalty on the proficiency throw per 4d6 x 10 additional shp. Divide damage from arson by 10 if the structure being damaged is constructed of stone.

If the proficiency throw fails, the arson attempt failed. If the proficiency throw fails by 14 or more or on an unmodified 1, the perpetrator has been caught. If caught, determine the charges with a 1d6 roll: vandalism (1 – 3), mayhem (4 – 5), or arson (6). There is no economic value in arson, so it is usually performed to warn or avenge.

**Arson for Military Purposes:** An infiltrated perpetrator can attempt to reduce the stronghold by arson. For arson to succeed, the perpetrator must make a successful Move Silently throw. The proficiency throw is modified by the opposing army’s leader’s strategic ability. If the throw is successful, the perpetrator destroys 4d6 x 10 shp per class level. The perpetrator can set a larger fire by taking a -1 penalty on the proficiency throw per 4d6 x 10 additional shp. Divide damage from arson by 10 if the besieged stronghold is stone.

###### Assassinating

Assassination is the murder of unsuspecting NPC targets for pay. (Assassinating a PC or suspicious NPC victim is an adventure, not a hijink.) Only assassins and elven nightblades can be assigned assassination hijinks — they will not be undertaken by thieves or other classes. An adventurer can assign an assassination against a particular target for personal reasons if desired. Otherwise, an assassination hijink is murder-for-hire on a victim within ±2 levels of the perpetrator’s level (i.e. 1d10/2 – 3 + perpetrator’s level).

For an assassination to succeed, the perpetrator must first make a successful Hiding throw. There is a -1 penalty on the proficiency throw per each level of the victim. In addition, for each of the following proficiencies the perpetrator knows, he gains a special +1 bonus on his throw to assassinate: Acrobatics, Disguise, Sniping. Skulking proficiency grants the usual +2 bonus to Hiding throws.

If the proficiency throw succeeds, the victim is slain. The boss collects a bounty equal to 1,000gp per level of the victim from whomever hired the guild. A victim assassinated for the boss’s personal reasons does not generate a bounty for the boss. 0th level victims count as half level for purposes of bounties (500gp).

If the proficiency throw fails, the assassination attempt failed. If the proficiency throw fails by 14 or more or is an unmodified 1, the perpetrator has been caught. If caught, determine the charges with a 1d6 roll: assault (1 – 3), mayhem (4 – 5), or murder (6).

**Assassination for Military Purposes:** A perpetrator that has infiltrated an army can target an identified enemy officer for an assassination hijink. For an assassination to succeed, the perpetrator must make a successful Hiding throw. There is a -1 penalty on the proficiency throw per level of the victim. The proficiency throw is further modified by the target officer’s morale modifier (as highly charismatic, popular officers tend to be better protected and harder to harm). If a perpetrator is caught attempting to assassinate an enemy officer, the charge is always murder.

**Assassination for Political Purposes:** A perpetrator can be assigned to assassinate a senator or other magistrate. Both leading and minor senators can be assassinated. If a leading senator is assassinated, half of the minor senators he controls become independent and the other half are allocated pro rata to members of his political faction (if none, then all of the votes he controls become independent). A new leading senator will emerge in 1d6 months. If a minor senator is assassinated, it reduces the influence of the leading senator who controlled him. Minor senators are always the minimum level for the senate. If a perpetrator is caught, the charge is sedition if the victim was a minor senator and high treason if a leading senator.

###### Carousing

Carousing includes all manner of consortium with barkeeps, gossips, harlots, jongleurs, tavern wenches, and other unsavory characters in unseemly inns and taverns. For carousing to succeed, the perpetrator must make a successful Listening throw. For each of the following proficiencies the perpetrator knows, he gains a special +1 bonus on his throw to carouse: Bribery, Diplomacy, Folkways, Lip Reading, Performance, Revelry, Seduction.

If the proficiency throw succeeds, the perpetrator learns one valuable rumor appropriate to the perpetrator’s location. The boss earns 3d12 x 5gp per level of the perpetrator exploiting the rumor through blackmail, insider trading, etc. Alternatively, the Judge may provide a specific rumor valuable within the ongoing campaign in lieu of money.

EXAMPLE: In his campaign’s starting city, the Judge has created a table of rumors that adventurers might learn from talking to NPCs. One such rumor is “The ruler of the city is actually a vampire – that’s why all official functions are held at night.” Rather than 3d12 x 5gp per level, the Judge could have the carouser hear that rumor.

If the proficiency throw fails, the perpetrator learns nothing. If the proficiency throw fails by 14 or more or is an unmodified 1, the perpetrator has been caught. If caught, determine the charges with a 1d6 roll: drunkenness (1 – 3), gambling (4 – 5), or vandalism (6).

**Carousing for Military Purposes:** A perpetrator infiltrated into an enemy army can acquire information through carousing hijinks. If the throw is successful, one piece of common information is acquired (as if interrogating a prisoner). Valuable information can be acquired by taking a -2 penalty on the proficiency throw; very valuable information by taking a -5 penalty. If a perpetrator is caught carousing, the charge is sedition.

**Carousing for Political Purposes:** Perpetrators based in senatorial republics can be told to seek out political rumors. If successful, the perpetrator learns one of the following pieces of information (roll 1d4):

1. The current influence of a random leading senator.
2. The policy objectives of a random leading senator.
3. The general itinerary of a random leading senator’s upcoming month. This information provides a +2 bonus to Assassination hijinks that month.
4. Compromising information worth 3d12 x 5gp per level with which a leading senator could be blackmailed. Blackmail can be resolved with Intimidation or Bribery proficiency (the “bribe” is not revealing the information).

**Hasty Carousing**: If the proficiency throw succeeds, the perpetrator learns a rumor of questionable value. The rumor has only a 25% chance to be true. If true, the rumor has the usual value. If false, the rumor is worthless.

###### Escaping

A perpetrator who is languishing in prison awaiting trial can attempt to escape. For escaping to succeed, the perpetrator must make a successful Lockpicking throw. For each of the following proficiencies the perpetrator knows, he gains a special +1 bonus on his throw to escape: Climbing, Contortionism, Trapfinding. Lockpicking Expertise proficiency grants the usual +2 bonus.

However, as more dangerous characters are kept under closer watch, the proficiency throw is penalized by severity of the crime: breach of peace, drunkenness, outrage of decency 0; eavesdropping, gambling, or trespassing -1; assault, bribery, contraband, extortion, theft, or vandalism -2; battery, burglary, kidnapping, rioting, or smuggling -3; manslaughter, mayhem, racketeering, rape, robbery, or sedition -4; arson, desertion, murder, or piracy -5; heresy, high treason, or regicide -6.

If the proficiency throw succeeds, the perpetrator escapes confinement and reaches the safety of the hideout (or other location of his choice). If the proficiency throw fails, the perpetrator is caught trying to escape and security on him is heightened. Each time security is heightened, the perpetrator suffers a -2 cumulative penalty on future escapes for this crime. If the proficiency throw fails by 14 or more or is an unmodified 1, the perpetrator is caught and punished for trying to escape. He is whipped (Death saving throw or suffer gruesome scarring, -2 to reaction rolls) and beaten (Blast saving throw or lose 1d6 teeth). Each time a perpetrator is caught and punished for trying to escape, he suffers a cumulative -2 penalty on future escapes and on his trial roll.

###### Infiltrating

Before any hijinks can be performed against an army, a perpetrator must be infiltrated into the opposing army as a spy. To undertake an infiltration hijink, the perpetrator must be a member of a race present in the opposing army’s troops, or be disguised with a successful Disguise proficiency throw in addition to the hijink throw. The perpetrator must also speak at least one the languages spoken by the opposing army’s troops and be able to wear the armor and weapons of at least one type of troop.

For infiltrating to succeed, the perpetrator must make a successful Hiding throw. For each of the following proficiencies the perpetrator knows, he gains a special +1 bonus on his throw to infiltrate the army: Bribery, Disguise, Manual of Arms. Skulking proficiency grants the usual +2 bonus.

If the proficiency throw succeeds, the perpetrator grants his army’s commander a +1 bonus on reconnaissance rolls made against the opposing army while he remains infiltrated (see p. XX). The infiltrated perpetrator also has the opportunity to conduct arson, assassinating, carousing, sabotaging, subverting, spying, or stealing hijinks thereafter. A perpetrator can remain infiltrated into the opposing army until caught performing another hijink or exposed by a vagary of war.

If the proficiency throw fails, the perpetrator failed to infiltrate the enemy army. If the proficiency throw fails by 14 or more or is an unmodified 1, the perpetrator has been caught attempting to infiltrate. If a perpetrator is caught attempting to infiltrate an enemy army, the charge is sedition.

###### Kidnapping

Kidnapping is the abduction of an unsuspecting victim to gain a hostage or extract a ransom. (Kidnapping a PC or suspicious NPC victim is an adventure, not a hijink.) An adventurer may assign a kidnapping against a particular target for personal reasons if desired. Otherwise, a kidnapping hijink is in order to ransom a valuable victim within 1d2 levels of the perpetrator’s level.

For kidnapping to succeed, the perpetrator must make a successful Hiding throw. There is a -1 penalty on the proficiency throw per each level of the victim. However, for each of the following proficiencies the perpetrator knows, he gains a special +1 bonus on his throw to kidnap: Combat Trickery (incapacitate), Intimidation, Tracking. Skulking proficiency grants the usual +2 bonus.

If the proficiency throw succeeds, the victim is kidnapped. The boss can thereafter interrogate, imprison, or otherwise exploit the victim. If the victim is ransomed, the boss earns 500gp per level of the victim. A victim kidnapped for the boss’s personal reasons cannot be ransomed except at Judge’s discretion. 0th level victims count as half level for purposes of bounties (250gp).

If the proficiency throw fails, the kidnapping attempt failed. If the proficiency throw fails by 14 or more or is an unmodified 1, the perpetrator has been caught. If caught, determine the charges with a 1d6 roll: assault (1 – 3), kidnapping (4 – 5), or racketeering (6).

###### Racketeering

Racketeering includes various criminal activities relying on force or threat of force, such as collecting on loans or extorting protection money. For racketeering to succeed, the perpetrator must make a successful attack throw against AC 6. STR or DEX modifiers may be applied, but not bonuses for magic weapons or fighting styles. However, for each of the following proficiencies the perpetrator knows, the perpetrator gains a special +1 bonus on his throw: Combat Trickery, Dungeonbashing Expertise, Intimidation.

If the proficiency throw succeeds, the perpetrator extorts 5d6 x 10gp per class level for the boss. If the proficiency throw fails, the perpetrator was not able to extort anything. If the proficiency throw fails by 14 or more or is an unmodified 1, the perpetrator has been caught. If caught, determine charges with a 1d6 roll: trespassing (1 – 3), assault (4 – 5) or racketeering (6).

**Hasty Racketeering:** If the throw succeeds, the perpetrator extorts 30gp per class level for the boss.

###### Sabotaging

A perpetrator who has infiltrated an enemy army (see Infiltration, above) can attempt to destroy the supplies of the opposing army. For sabotage to succeed, the perpetrator must make a successful Sneaking throw. The proficiency throw is modified by the opposing army’s leader’s strategic ability (as skilled generals tend to be better at guarding their supply train). In addition, for each of the following proficiencies the perpetrator knows, he gains a special +1 bonus on his throw to sabotage the supplies: Animal Training, Manual of Arms, Siege Engineering. Skulking proficiency grants the usual +2 bonus.

If the proficiency throw succeeds, the perpetrator destroys 1,000gp of supplies per class level (representing a mix of grains, beer, preserved meat, salt, etc.) The perpetrator can destroy extra supplies by taking a -1 penalty on the proficiency throw per 1,000gp.

If the proficiency throw fails, the perpetrator failed to infiltrate the enemy army. If the proficiency throw fails by 14 or more or is an unmodified 1, the perpetrator has been caught attempting sabotage. If a perpetrator is caught attempting to sabotage an army’s supplies, the charge is arson.

###### Slandering

A Perpetrator based in senatorial republics can spread lies and rumors about a leading senator, reducing his influence. For slandering to succeed, the perpetrator must make a successful Hear Noise throw. There is a -1 penalty on the proficiency throw per each level the perpetrator is lower than the victim. However, for each of the following proficiencies the perpetrator knows, he gains a special +1 bonus on his throw to slander the senator: Diplomacy, Folkways, Performance, Revelry, Seduction.

If the proficiency throw succeeds, the targeted senator loses control of one minor senator per level of the perpetrator. If the proficiency throw fails, the perpetrator’s slander failed to have any impact with his slander. If the proficiency throw fails by 14 or more or is an unmodified 1, the perpetrator has been caught. If caught, determine the charges with a 1d6 roll: outrage (1 – 3), sedition (4 – 5), or treason (6).

**Slandering for Military Purposes:** A perpetrator infiltrated into an enemy army can spread lies and rumors through the army’s ranks. If the throw is successful, any reconnaissance rolls made by the opposing army are at a -2 penalty for the next month. If a perpetrator is caught slandering, the charge is sedition.

###### Smuggling

Smuggling is the illicit movement of goods in order to avoid tolls, customs duties, labor fees, and monopolies. For smuggling to succeed, the perpetrator must make a successful Sneaking throw. For each of the following proficiencies the perpetrator knows, he gains a special +1 bonus on his throw to smuggle: Alertness, Bargaining, Bribery, Disguise. Skulking proficiency grants the usual +2 bonus.

If the proficiency throw succeeds, the perpetrator smuggles merchandise worth 3,000gp per class level. The exact type of merchandise smuggled will be either chosen by the Judge based on the demand modifiers in the urban settlement or randomly rolled on the Random Merchandise table (see Mercantile Ventures, p. XX). The perpetrator can attempt to smuggle a particular type of merchandise by taking a -4 penalty on the proficiency throw. The perpetrator can smuggle more cargo by taking a -1 penalty on the proficiency throw per 3,000gp extra. When smuggling succeeds, the boss collects a fee equal to 10% of the market value of the merchandise smuggled.

If the proficiency throw fails, the perpetrator was not able to move the merchandise. If the proficiency throw fails by 14 or more or is an unmodified 1, the perpetrator has been caught and the merchandise confiscated. If caught, determine charges with a 1d6 roll: contraband (1 – 3), smuggling (4 – 5), racketeering (6).

**Smuggling Prisoners:** A smuggling hijink can be used to rescue a perpetrator who is in prison awaiting trial. Apply a penalty to the throw based on the severity of the crime (as per Escaping, above). If the proficiency throw fails, the perpetrator was not able to rescue his target. If the proficiency throw fails by 14 or more or is an unmodified 1, the perpetrator has been caught in the jailbreak. If caught, he is considered a conspirator of the imprisoned criminal and faces the same charges.

**Smuggling During Sieges:** A defending army leader with access to perpetrators can order his perpetrators to attempt smuggling hijinks to re-supply his stronghold. The proficiency throw is penalized by the besieging leader’s strategic ability. If a circumvallation completely encircles the stronghold, the proficiency throw suffers an additional -4 penalty. If the proficiency throw succeeds, the perpetrator smuggles 1,000gp of supplies in per class level. (This amount is less than the standard 3,000gp per class level because it consists of high-bulk, low-value items such as grains, preserved meat, salt, onions, etc. A perpetrator who wants to smuggle in more valuable goods can still do so, but the gp value cannot be applied towards supply cost.) The perpetrator can smuggle extra supplies by taking a -1 penalty on the proficiency throw per 3,000gp. If a perpetrator is caught smuggling for military purposes, the charge is sedition.

###### Soliciting

Soliciting is the unlawful invitation to engage in sexual relations for a fee. For soliciting to succeed, the perpetrator must make a successful Listening throw. For each of the following proficiencies the perpetrator knows, he gains a special +1 bonus on his throw to solicit: Bargaining, Folkways, Performance (dance), Revelry, Seduction. In addition, the perpetrator can add his CHA modifier to the throw. No, Contortionism and Endurance do not provide bonuses.

If the proficiency throw succeeds, the perpetrator earns 3d12 x 5gp per class level for the boss. If the proficiency throw fails, the perpetrator was not able to earn anything. If the proficiency throw fails by 14 or more or is an unmodified 1, the perpetrator has been caught. If caught, determine charges with a 1d6 roll: outrage of decency (1 – 3), solicitation (4 – 5) or consortium (6).

**Hasty Soliciting:** If the proficiency throw succeeds, the perpetrator earns 3d6gp per class level for the boss.

###### Spying

Spying is the clandestine retrieval of secrets from powerful and influential figures. For spying to succeed, the perpetrator must make a successful Hiding throw. For each of the following proficiencies the perpetrator knows, he gains a special +1 bonus on his throw to spy: Disguise, Eavesdropping, Lip Reading. Skulking proficiency grants the usual +2 bonus.

If the proficiency throw succeeds, the perpetrator gathers evidence of confidential activities, secret facts, or other highly valuable information from the perpetrator’s area of operation. The information learned from spying is similar to that learned from carousing, but much more valuable: carousing only reveals gossip and hearsay while spying gathers evidence and proof. Successfully carousing offers leads; successfully spying offers actionable info that can be used to blackmail, extort, humiliate, or otherwise exploit some unlucky fool. The Judge can offer specific secrets valuable within the ongoing campaign or simply abstract it as a gp value. If the latter, then the boss earns 2d12 x 100gp per level of the perpetrator exploiting the valuable secret.

EXAMPLE: A perpetrator who succeeds on a carousing hijink in a city might hear that “The ruler of this city is actually a vampire – that’s why all official functions are held at night.” The same perpetrator in the same area who succeeds on a spying hijink might acquire a copy of the lord’s itinerary showing him holding court with specific NPCs by night and unavailable by day.

If the proficiency throw fails, the perpetrator learns nothing. If the proficiency throw fails by 14 or more or is an unmodified 1, the perpetrator has been caught. If caught, determine charges with a 1d6 roll: eavesdropping (1 – 3), sedition (4 – 5), or treason (6).

**Spying for Political Purposes:** Perpetrators can be assigned to spy on a specific leading senator. If successful, the perpetrator will learn 2d12 x 100gp per level worth of compromising information with which to blackmail the senator. In addition, the spy will learn one piece of information about the senator, determined randomly on the table below. If a perpetrator is caught spying on a leading senator, the charge is high treason.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Roll | Secret |
| 1 | The current influence of the leading senator and 1d3 members of his political faction. |
| 2 | The policy objectives of the leading senator and 1d3 members of his political faction. |
| 3 | The senator’s current attitude towards the ruler (roll 2d6 and tell the player the number. This number will be the die roll on the senator’s next voting roll). |
| 4 | The general itinerary of a random leading senator’s upcoming month. This information provides a +2 bonus to Assassination or Kidnapping hijinks that month. |

**Spying for Military Purposes:** A perpetrator infiltrated into an enemy army can acquire information through spying hijinks. If the throw is successful, one piece of very valuable military information is obtained (see p. XX). If a perpetrator is caught spying in an enemy army, the charge is high treason.

###### Stealing

Stealing includes all manner of burglary, robbery, and theft. For stealing to succeed, the perpetrator must make a successful Pickpocketing throw. For each of the following proficiencies the perpetrator knows, he gains a special +1 bonus on his throw to steal: Cat Burglary, Lockpicking Expertise, Trapfinding.

If the proficiency throw succeeds, the perpetrator steals goods worth 300gp per class level. The exact type of merchandise stolen will be either chosen by the Judge based on the demand modifiers in the urban settlement or randomly rolled on the Random Merchandise table (see Mercantile Ventures, p. XX). The perpetrator can attempt to steal a particular item available in the settlement (such as a magic item, vessel, valuable mount, etc.) or a particular type of merchandise, by taking a -4 penalty on the proficiency throw. The value of the item or merchandise cannot exceed 300gp per class level. However, the perpetrator can steal more by taking a -1 penalty on the proficiency throw per 300gp extra. When stealing succeeds, the boss receives the market value of the stolen merchandise.

If the proficiency throw fails, the perpetrator was not able to steal anything. If the proficiency throw fails by 14 or more or is an unmodified 1, the perpetrator has been caught. If caught, determine charges with a 1d6 roll: theft (1 – 3), burglary (4 – 5) or robbery (6).

EXAMPLE: Viktir is an 11th level thief with a Pickpocketing target value of 2+. He has Cat Burglary and Lockpicking Expertise, giving him a +2 bonus on Pickpocketing throws to steal merchandise. On anything but a 1, Viktir can steal 3,300gp worth of merchandise. However, Viktir wants to steal something in particular — the carved ivory torch in the Temple of Mityara (4,000gp value). He suffers a -4 penalty to his throw for targeting a specific item and another -3 penalty for the extra value. He needs to roll 8+ to successfully steal the relic.

**Stealing for Military Purposes:** A perpetrator who has infiltrated an enemy army can attempt to steal the flag of one of the units in the opposing army. The proficiency throw is modified by the target unit’s morale score (representing the unit’s discipline at the watch). If the throw is successful, the unit in question has lost its flag. This is so demoralizing that the unit must immediately make a loyalty roll at a -1 penalty. (Attempting to steal the emblem of the entire army imposes a penalty of -10 on the proficiency throw, but if successful each unit in the army must make a loyalty roll at a -1 penalty.) If a perpetrator is caught stealing for military purposes, the charge is sedition.

###### Subverting

A perpetrator who has infiltrated a stronghold can attempt to subvert the stronghold’s defenses. For subversion to succeed, the perpetrator must make a successful Hiding throw. For each of the following proficiencies the perpetrator knows, he gains a special +1 bonus on his throw to subvert the defenses: Disguise, Manual of Arms, Siege Engineering. Skulking proficiency grants the usual +2 bonus. The proficiency throw is modified by the opposing army leader’s strategic ability. If the throw is successful, the perpetrator creates a breach in the stronghold. The perpetrator can create additional breaches by taking a -1 penalty on the proficiency throw per breach. Breaches created with subversion must be exploited with an assault immediately or they are lost, as they are nothing more than unlocked doors, opened gates, etc.

###### Treasure-Hunting

Treasure-hunting covers all manner of skulking and scavenging for treasure maps and rumors of hidden wealth. For treasure-hunting to succeed, the perpetrator must make a successful Searching throw. For each of the following proficiencies the perpetrator knows, he gains a special +1 bonus on his throw to find treasure maps: Caving, Land Surveying, Mapping. Trapfinding proficiency grants the usual +2 bonus. If the throw is successful, the perpetrator finds a treasure map to a random hoard worth 1d6 x 1,000gp per level of the perpetrator. The Judge determines the exact location of the hoard; hoards will generally be at least 6 miles away from the boss’s hideout for each 1,000gp value.

If the proficiency throw fails, the perpetrator finds nothing. If the proficiency throw fails by 14 or more or is an unmodified 1, the perpetrator has been caught. If caught, determine charges with a 1d6 roll: trespassing (1 – 3), theft (4 – 5), or burglary (6).

### Getting Caught

Whenever the proficiency throw fails by 14 or more or is an unmodified 1, the perpetrator has been caught. The Judge immediately rolls 1d6 to determine the crime for which the perpetrator is arrested. The perpetrator is then sent to the settlement’s brig, dungeon, jail, or other prison to await trial.

###### Awaiting Trial

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Crime | Time Languishing |
| Drunkenness, Outrage | 1d2 days |
| Eavesdropping, Trespassing, Gambling | 1d4 days |
| Bribery, Theft, Contraband | 1d6 days |
| Assault, Vandalism | 1d8 days |
| Burglary, Smuggling | 1d4 weeks |
| Kidnapping, Manslaughter, Mayhem | 1d4 months |
| Robbery, Racketeering | 1d6 months |
| Arson, Desertion, Murder, Sedition | 1d12 months |
| Heresy, High Treason, Regicide | 2d12 months |

Since trials don’t happen immediately, any character caught committing a hijink must perform this “activity” while languishing in the settlement’s prison.

Awaiting trial is an ongoing dedicated activity that includes cowering in darkness, suffering the lash, eating prison gruel, and other torments. The time spent languishing depends on the crime charged against the character, as shown on the accompanying table. Characters caught committing a hijink do not roll on the Crime and Punishment table until after they have finished awaiting trial.

The first time a perpetrator gets caught, he can automatically finish awaiting trial by pleading guilty and accepting the lesser punishment for his crime.

The second time a perpetrator gets caught in the same settlement, he can still plead guilty, but he will have to accept the standard punishment for his crime. A perpetrator who is caught for a third time must stand trial.

EXAMPLE: Reingo the Ruthless, a 1st level thief, is caught stealing in Cyfaraun and charged with theft. It’s his first time getting caught in Cyfaraun. Rather than await trial and risk a severe punishment, he pleads guilty. He automatically receives the lesser punishment for his crime. He is placed in stocks 2d6 days (as above) and fined 150gp.

A month later, Reingo gets caught stealing in Cyfaraun and is charged with theft. It’s his second time getting caught, so now if he pleads guilty he has to face the standard punishment. He’d be whipped and fined 300gp. Reingo decides to stand trial instead.

###### Undergoing Trial

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Crime and Punishment** | |
| **Adjusted Die Roll** | **Result** |
| 2- | Punitive Conviction |
| 3 – 5 | Conviction |
| 6 – 8 | Conviction on Lesser Charge |
| 9 – 11 | Acquittal |
| 12+ | Acquittal with Damages |

Any perpetrator who gets caught might face legal penalties for his deeds if found guilty at trial. To determine the punishments suffered, the Judge rolls 2d6 on the Crime and Punishment table. Adjust the die roll by the perpetrator’s Charisma modifier and any appropriate proficiency modifiers (from Diplomacy, Mystic Aura, or Seduction). Other circumstances that will apply are listed below.

**Bribery:** The syndicate boss or one of his henchmen or followers can attempt to corrupt the courts. If the bribing character is proficient in Bribery, he gains a +1 bonus for offering a day’s wages, +2 for a week’s, and +3 for a month’s. If not proficient, the bonus is +1 for a week’s wages, +2 for a month’s, and +3 for a year’s. A day’s wage for the court is the equivalent of 50gp, a week’s is 350gp, a month’s is 1,500gp, and a year’s is 18,000gp. If the result of the Crime and Punishment roll is an unmodified 2, the syndicate member who offered the bribe is charged with a crime — Sedition if the perpetrator was on trial for Heresy, High Treason, or Regicide, and Bribery for any other crime.

**Evidence:** Roll 1d4 to represent evidence favorable to the perpetrator (alibis, good character, etc.). Roll 1d8 to determine the penalty from unfavorable evidence (witnesses to the crime, caught with stolen goods, etc.)

**Interpleader:** If the syndicate has ties with a domain ruler, the ruler could plead on the perpetrator’s behalf. Add the Charisma modifier of the domain ruler, plus an additional +1 if the interpleader has either Diplomacy or Intimidation and another +1 if he has Mystic Aura. Note that if the domain ruler controls the domain where the crime happened, he may free the perpetrator without resorting to trial at all.

**Attorney:** Add the perpetrator’s rank in Profession (lawyer), if any. Otherwise, a lawyer can be hired by the syndicate. A rank 1 lawyer costs 25gp, a rank 2 lawyer costs 50gp, and a rank 3 lawyer costs 100gp.

**Prior Crimes:** -1 if perpetrator has been branded; -2 if perpetrator has been maimed (loss of tongue or hands); -3 if perpetrator has been proscribed.

**Severity of Crime:** The worse the crime, the worse the penalty. Breach of peace, drunkenness, outrage of decency 0; eavesdropping, gambling, or trespassing -1; assault, bribery, contraband, extortion, theft, or vandalism -2; battery, burglary, kidnapping, rioting, or smuggling -3; manslaughter, mayhem, racketeering, rape, robbery, or sedition -4; arson, desertion, murder, or piracy -5; heresy, high treason, or regicide -6.

The result of the table indicates the fate of the perpetrator. A **punitive conviction** means that the perpetrator has been found guilty and will be punished out of proportion to his charges to serve as a deterrent to others. A **conviction** means that the perpetrator has been found guilty of the charges and will be punished appropriately. **Conviction on lesser charge** means that the perpetrator has been found guilty, but will not be punished as severely. **Acquittal** means the perpetrator has been found innocent. **Acquittal with damages** means that the perpetrator has been found so innocent that the court awards monetary damages for the offense to his reputation. Damages are always equal to what the fine would have been for the charges.

The Retribution by Crime table can be used to find an appropriate punishment for various charges. Punishments can include various forms of fines, humiliation, torture, mutilation, enslavement, exile, and execution. A perpetrator who cannot pay a fine is indentured to work off the fine. Perpetrators work off fines at a rate of 3gp per month. A perpetrator who can pay three times the amount of a fine can avoid other associated punishments.

The syndicate boss is expected to pay for the lawyers, bribes, fines, and healing of members who get caught while assigned hijinks. If the boss regularly abandons his members to their fate, the Judge can roll on the Hireling Loyalty table to see if the remaining syndicate members attack or betray their boss.

EXAMPLE: Reingo the Ruthless, a 1st level thief, is caught stealing a bundle of rare furs (500gp) and charged with theft (-2). Reingo is quite uncharismatic (-2) and the evidence looks bad (the 1d4 roll scores +1, while the 1d8 roll scores -5, for a -4 penalty). Since Reingo has been a loyal follower, his boss Viktir hires the best available attorney (+3) for 100gp and spends 350gp on bribes (+2). Reingo will roll on the Crime and Punishment table with a -3 on the die roll. He rolls an 8, reduced by 3, for a score of 5, resulting in a Conviction. Reingo will be whipped and fined 500gp.

| Burglary,  Smuggling | Both hands amputated (cannot climb, use weapons or items, open locks, remove traps, or any other similar actions) and fined 900gp | Branded (gruesome scarring, as the Mortal Wound) and fined 600gp | Whipped (as above) and fined 450gp |
| Kidnapping,  Manslaughter,  Mayhem | Tortured and proscribed (lose all property and rights, permanently exiled) | Tortured (Death save or suffer permanent wound from row 11-15 of Mortal Wounds table) and 750gp | Whipped (as above) and fined 600gp |
| Robbery,  Racketeering | Execution (beheaded or hung) and fined 1,200gp | Hand amputated (cannot dual wield or use two-handed weapons) and fined 900gp | Branded (gruesome scarring, as the Mortal Wound) and fined 750gp |
| Arson, Desertion, Murder,  Sedition | Agonizing execution (burned, crucified, drawn and quartered, or devoured by wild beasts such that no intact corpse remains) | Execution (beheaded or hung) | Proscribed (lose all property and rights, permanently exiled) |
| Heresy, High Treason, Regicide | Fate worse than death (cross-bred into monstrous creature, transformed into undead, etc.) | Agonizing execution (burned, crucified, drawn and quartered, devoured by wild beasts such that no intact corpse remains) | Execution (beheaded or hung) |

**Risks of Military Hijinks:** Performing hijinks against enemy armies is highly risky. If a perpetrator is caught performing a hijink, not only are very severe charges always levied against him, neither attorneys nor interpleaders are available. If the perpetrator is convicted, he will suffer the usual punishments. He will also be interrogated as a **prisoner**. If the perpetrator is 0th – 4th level, he has the information of a common prisoner; if 5th – 8th level, a valuable prisoner; if 9th level or more, a very valuable prisoner. (If the perpetrator is a PC, the Judge might allow the PC to negotiate a trade of information for a reduced sentence…)

**Risks of Crews:** If two or more perpetrators from a crew are caught, they face grave risk from defection. Make a reaction roll for each perpetrator towards his crew members. If all of the perpetrators are friendly to each other, they each gain a +2 bonus on the Crime and Punishment table. If one of the perpetrators is indifferent or worse, while all the other perpetrators are friendly, the indifferent perpetrator rats them out. He gains a +4 bonus and his crew members suffer a -4 penalty. If two or more perpetrators are indifferent or worse, everyone rats out, and all crew members suffer a -4 penalty. Syndicate bosses have closely studied this “prisoner’s dilemma” but in the absence of magical communication methods or crews with longstanding trust between them, there seems no way to reliably avoid defection.

### Creating a Criminal Guild

A **criminal guild** is a group of multiple syndicates under the control of one boss. Criminal guilds are commonly named for the class of their boss and primary constituents, e.g. a thieves’ guild or assassins’ guild. There are four general ways an adventurer can create a criminal guild.

###### New Base of Operations

A boss whose syndicate has reached its maximum size in its current base of operations can decide to establish a new syndicate in a new base of operations by building a hideout there and relocating some of his membership. The new syndicate in the new base of operations becomes part of the adventurer’s criminal guild.

EXAMPLE: Viktir’s syndicate, based in Siadanos (a Class IV settlement), has reached its maximum size of 100 members. In order to keep his criminal enterprise growing, Viktir builds a new hideout in Cyfaraun (a Class III settlement) and moves 20 of his members there.

###### Henchman Advancement

If one of the boss’s assassin, thief, or nightblade henchmen reaches 9th level, the adventurer may fund a hideout for the henchman. The henchman will attract followers into a syndicate as per the rules above, and the henchman’s syndicate becomes part of the adventurer’s criminal guild.

###### Henchman Acquisition

A boss can recruit an NPC who already controls a syndicate to be a henchman. The new henchman’s syndicate becomes part of the adventurer’s criminal guild.

###### Change in Management

An assassin, elven nightblade, thief, or venturer can exile, imprison, or kill an NPC who already controls a syndicate. He may then claim the syndicate and its members as his own. The Judge should roll on the Change in Management table for each of the NPC’s former henchmen and followers to see if they are successfully recruited by the adventurer. For very large syndicates, the Judge may roll in batches of 5, 10, 25, or even 100 where appropriate.

The character’s CHA modifier is applied as a die roll modifier, along with any bonuses from proficiencies and powers. If the character is higher level than the previous leader, add a +1 bonus per level difference; apply a -1 penalty per level difference if the converse is true. Apply the previous leader’s CHA bonus (if any) as a penalty to the recruitment roll. If desired, the adventurer can bribe one, some, or all of the members, with the cost determined by their class level on the Henchmen Wage table. The Judge may apply an additional modifier between -2 to +2 reflecting the adventurer’s reputation or other circumstances

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Change in Management** | |
| **Adjusted Die Roll (2d6)** | **Result** |
| 2- | Immediate Attack |
| 3 – 5 | Betray |
| 6 – 8 | Hesitate |
| 9 – 11 | Accept |
| 12+ | Accept with élan |

**Immediate attack** means that the member seeks immediate revenge against the adventurer and will attack him at the first available opportunity. **Betray** means that the member will pretend to be loyal to adventurer, but will betray him if an opportunity to do so presents itself. **Hesitate** means that the member feels conflicting loyalties. He will betray the adventurer if a plurality of his fellows do so, but remain loyal if not. **Accept** means that the member becomes loyal to the character. **Accept with élan** means the member becomes exceptionally loyal, and gains a permanent +1 bonus to his loyalty score.

EXAMPLE: Viktir, a 14th level thief with CHA 13, assassinates Rollio, a 12th level thief with CHA 16 and four followers. Viktir claims Rollio’s four followers for himself, so the Judge secretly rolls to see how Rollio’s followers respond to the change in management. Each die roll will be at +2 (because Viktir is two levels higher than Rollio) +1 (from Viktir’s CHA) -2 (from Rollio’s CHA), for a total of +1. The Judge rolls incredibly badly — an adjusted 3, 5, 8, and 9. Only one follower is loyal to Viktir. One is hesitant, and two plan to betray Viktir. Since the two betrayers are a plurality, the hesitant follower will join their attempt.

### Managing a Criminal Guild

A boss can only directly manage one syndicate at a time. Other syndicates in the criminal guild must be assigned to a henchman to manage, either the henchman who established the syndicate or one appointed by the adventurer. A henchman who manages a syndicate is called an **underboss**.

A boss can assign hijinks to his own syndicate members, and to the members of any syndicates controlled by his underbosses. However, underbosses expect to be given wide latitude in running their part of the syndicate. If the boss assigns hijinks to more than 20% of the followers that any underboss controls, this causes the underboss to roll on the Hireling Loyalty table, with a -1 penalty per each additional 10% of the followers that the adventurer is ordering around. A henchman who resigns or becomes hostile takes his syndicate with him.

In lieu of assigning hijinks to his underbosses, a boss can simply demand a percentage of their revenue. A revenue share of 20% will be accepted without issue by the underbosses. If the boss demands a greater percentage, it triggers a roll on the Hireling Loyalty table as above.

**Underbosses** may themselves have underbosses beneath them. In this way very large criminal guilds spread across multiple bases of operation can be formed. For purposes of assigning hijinks, each underboss can be assumed to have direct control over 20% of the followers one rank below him on the chain.

EXAMPLE: Viktir manages a syndicate with 80 followers in Cyfaraun. His underboss, Anzio, manages a syndicate with 20 followers in Arganos. Anzio himself has an underboss with 10 followers in Isfaran. Anzio directly manages his own 20 followers plus 20% of his underboss’s 10, for a total of 22 followers. Viktir directly manages his own 80 followers plus 20% of Anzio’s 22, for a total of 84 followers. If Viktir assigns hijinks to greater than 20% of Anzio’s followers, this will cause Anzio to roll on the Henchman Loyalty table.

## Mercantile Ventures

In their youth, adventurers are wont to squander their treasures on wine, women, and song. But older, wiser adventurers, who have faced death one time too often for a bare handful of coin, may find that their favorite type of venture is mercantile.

### Entering the Market

In order to engage in **mercantile ventures**, the adventurers must first travel to and enter a **market**. Markets allow adventurers to buy and sell **merchandise** such as such as “wheat & vegetables,” “pottery,” and “tools.”There are 19 different types of common merchandise and 10 types of precious merchandiseavailable in each market. (The complete list is found on the Common and Precious Merchandise tables below.) These 29 types of merchandise collectively but abstractly represent all available goods in the market. Markets also allow adventurers to find **passengers** who want to book passage to other markets and to accept contracts from **shippers** who need fleets or wagons to carry goods from port to port. Finally, markets offer **investment** opportunities for adventurers with spare cash.In short, markets are to mercantile venturers what dungeons are to adventures — they’re where the action takes place!

When adventurers enter a market, the Judge should guide play through the following steps.

###### 1. Determine the Market’s Characteristics

A market can be anything from a humble county fair to a city-state’s outdoor bazaar to the ports of a major metropolis, but each has different characteristics. Each domain generally has its own separate market.

Markets are rated by **market class** from I to VI, which rate their size and importance. The market class of an urban settlement determines:

* the **baseline merchant cargo** required to make an impact in the market;
* the **toll** charged to enter the market and **tariff** imposed on imported merchandise;
* the volume of **merchandise** available to buy and sell;
* the number of **shipping consignments** available for carriage; and
* the number of **passengers** interested in booking passage.

The vast mercantile hubs of empires, with urban populations of 20,000 families or more, constitute Class I. Major ports, national capitals, and other large cities of 5,000 or more families constitute Class II. Provincial capitals and medium-sized cities of 1,750 to 5,000 families make up Class III. Small cities and large towns of 600 to 1,750 families make up Class IV. Small towns and large villages of 250 to 600 families are Class V. Any village of 250 families or less is Class VI.

The Market Characteristics table shows the baseline merchant cargo for each market class, along with the toll charged, number of passengers, and number of shipping consignments at the baseline.

|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Market**  **Class** | **Baseline**  **Cargo** | **Baseline**  **Toll** | **Baseline**  **Tariff** | **Baseline**  **Consignments** | **Baseline**  **Passengers** |
| **I** | 30,000 st | 0.2cp/st | 20% and 5% | 4,000 st | 2d6+1 x 10 |
| **II** | 7,500 st | 0.2cp/st | 20% and 5% | 1,000 st | 6d6 |
| **III** | 3,750 st | 0.2cp/st | 20% and 5% | 500 st | 4d4 |
| **IV** | 1,000 st | 0.1 cp/st | 20% and 5% | 120 st | 2d3 |
| **V** | 400 st | 0.1 cp/st | 20% and 5% | 50 st | 1d4 |
| **VI** | 150 st | None | None | 20 st | 1d2-1 |

In addition to being assigned a market class, each market is also assigned a unique set of **demand modifiers**, determined by the Judge, for the different types of merchandise. The demand modifier modifies the price for merchandise in the market. A low demand modifier indicates that merchandise is easy to get cheaply, usually because the market is a producer of that merchandise. A high demand modifier indicates that the merchandise is hard to get and very expensive. (See **Generating Demand Modifiers** in the ***ACKS II Judges Journal*** if the DMs are unknown).

EXAMPLE: Alakyrum, the capital of Opelenea, is a Class I market. Its demand modifiers are Grain +3, Salt -3, Pottery -2, Common Wood +3, Wine & Spirits +2, Oil +2, Glassware -2, Rare Wood +2, Common Metal +2, Textiles+2, Dyes & Pigments +1, Clothing -2, Tools -2, Armor & Weapons -2, Monster Parts +1, Precious Metals +1, Spices -2, Silk -2, Semiprecious Stones -1. Alakyrum is an exporter of salt, glass, clothing, tools, weapons, and spices, and silk. It is an importer of grain, wood, wine, and textiles.

###### 2. Determine the Adventurer’s Market Impact

When a character (or party of characters) wants to enter a market, the Judge should determine the party’s **market impact** based on the number of boats, vessels, wagons, carts, and pack animals they have entered the market with relative to the market’s baseline merchant cargo. The character or party’s market impact is equal to the total cargo capacity its boats, vessels, wagons, carts, porters, and/or pack animals can carry divided by the market’s baseline merchant cargo. Round fractions to the nearest whole number, rounding 0.5 to even.

Market Impact = Total Load / Baseline Merchant Cargo

Market impact represents the fact that the city magistrates will charge a higher toll to the commander of a six-ship fleet than to an itinerant peddler with a single wagon, and that more of the city’s traders ought to be interested in doing business with a mighty merchant-captain than a lowly peddler.

EXAMPLE: On 4/1/381, Caleför arrives at Alakyrum at the head of a caravan of 40 four-horse wagons. Four-horse wagons have a maximum load of 640 st, so his total cargo capacity is (40 x 640) is 25,600. Alakyrum is a Class I market, so its baseline cargo is 30,000 st Caleför has a market impact of (25,600 / 30,000) 0.85, rounded to 1.

**Maximum Impact:** If the characters are entering a Class II market or smaller, their maximum market impact is 10. The market simply cannot service a fleet or caravan any bigger. The maximum market impact permitted in a Class I market, however, is equal to the greater of 10 or its urban families / 2,000.

EXAMPLE: En route from Alakyrum, Caleför arrives at a small village at a nameless oasis. The village is a Class VI market with a baseline cargo of 150 st With a cargo capacity of 25,600 st, Caleför’s market impact would be (26,500 / 150) 177. However, since Caleför is in a Class VI market, his maximum market impact is 10. It’s easy to flood small markets.

**Parties:** A group of characters arriving together can decide when entering the market whether to do so as a party or to enter separately. Their market impact is determined accordingly. However, when a party of characters enter the market separately, the maximum market impact is limited to 10 divided by the number of characters.

EXAMPLE: On the far side of the empire, Marcus, Quintus, and Viktir enter Arganos, a Class II market, to trade. Each of the trio commands a small sailing ship with a cargo capacity of 10,000 st. As a Class II market, Arganos has a baseline cargo of 7,500 st. They could each enter Arganos separately, accepting a market impact of (10,000 / 7,500) 1.33 or 1 each, or they could enter collectively with a market impact of (30,000 / 7,500) 4 for the party as a whole.

**No Market Impact:** If a character’s market impact is 0, he can still transact in the market. If he has the Mercantile Network class power and uses it to increase his market impact, he can transact at market impact 1. Otherwise, he treats the market as being of the next lower market class for mercantile purposes (excluding tolls). If his market impact is still 0, reduce the market class again, repeating this procedure until the character’s market impact is at least 1. A character can always trade in a Class VI market as if he had market impact 1.

EXAMPLE: In a tragically bad game of dice, Viktir loses a lot of his wealth. He is forced to sell his sailing ship and replace it with a pair of 5 sail boats with 3,000 st total cargo capacity. When he next enters Arganos, his market impact would be less than 1, so treats it as if it were a Class III market instead of a Class II market. He has market impact 1 in a class III market, as (3,000 / 3,750) rounds to 1.

**Mercantile Networks:** Whenever venturersengage in mercantile ventures in a market they have previously visited, they may treat the market as one class higher, or treat their market impact as one point higher, whichever is more beneficial. (The benefit does not increase his tolls in either case.) Reputable and established venturers attract interest just from entering the market, and can rely on their reputation rather than the size of their caravan or fleet to impress potential buyers and sellers.

EXAMPLE #1: Cain, a 5th level venturer, is in Siadanos (a Class IV market). He wishes to purchase a heavy warhorse (700gp). According to the Equipment Availability by Market Class table, there is only a 25% chance for 1 heavy warhorse to be available in a Class IV market. However, Cain has visited Siadanos before, so he may treat it as a Class III market. There is a 100% chance for 1 heavy warhorse available in a Class III market, so Cain is able to purchase the heavy warhorse. His party members shake their heads in amazement that he’s found such a fine steed in an outpost town. “I know people,” he explains.

EXAMPLE #2: Caleför is a 6th level venturer who has done business in Alakyrum before. Since Alakyrum is already Class I, he decides to trade there as if his market impact were 2, not 1. This does not affect tolls.

###### 3. Charge Toll and Tariff at Point of Entry

Adventurers arriving by road enter markets at caravanserai, city gates, or other points of entry. City watchmen, customs agents, and toll collectors monitor these points of entry, where they demand to see proofs of citizenship, interrogate foreign travelers, inspect cargo for taxable goods, examine duty stamps, and so on.

Adventurers arriving by ship enter the market at a pier, dock, or other port. Heavily-trafficked ports with busy or dangerous waterways might require that incoming vessels retain specialized pilots to navigate the ship safely to a berth; small ports with crowded berths might require ships to anchor in the harbor, with small boats being used to disembark passengers and unload cargo. Harbor masters, customs officers, and marines will greet arriving boats and ships with inspection, interrogation, and taxation.

All of this takes time, so entering the market counts as a **dedicated activity** for a day. It also takes money. Each time adventurers enter a market, they must pay a **toll** (unless they sneak in). The standard cost of the toll is shown on the Market Characteristics table. This represents harbor fees paid to the harbormaster of a port, guild tolls at the city gate for caravans, etc.

EXAMPLE: Caleför has just arrived at Alakyrum at the head of a caravan of 40 wagons with a cargo capacity of 25,600 st. Alakyrum is Class I, so the standard toll is 0.2cp per st. His toll is therefore 25,600 x 0.2cp = 5,120cp or 51.2gp.

If the adventurers enter a market with merchandise they intend to sell, they may also have to pay a **tariff**. The tariff is equal to 20% of the base cost of precious merchandise and 5% of the base cost of common merchandise other than wheat. Player characters disinclined to pay tolls and tariffs can, of course, attempt to smuggle goods into the market.

**Ruler’s Privilege:** Adventurers entering a market in a domain they control need not pay tolls or tariffs.

**Designer’s Note:** The tolls and tariffs presented here are loosely based on those used in the Roman Empire, which imposed tariffs of up to 25% on luxury goods such as spices and 5% to 2.5% on other goods excluding grain and oil, plus various other surcharges. The Judge can adjust the nature and cost of the “toll” to reflect the specific fees appropriate to his own setting, of course. The Judge can also randomize the tariff at 2d20% for precious merchandise and 2d4% for common merchandise.

### Engaging in Mercantile Ventures

Once a party or character has entered the market, they can begin to engage in mercantile ventures. The available mercantile ventures are **arbitrage trading**, **passenger and cargo transport**,and **passive investment**.Each is discussed separately below.

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Vehicle/Animal | Moorage/Stabling | Anchor/Pasture |  |
| Ship | 1gp per 50 shp | 1gp |  |
| Wagon\* | 2gp | 5sp |  |
| Cart\*, Elephant | 1gp | 2sp |  |
| Horse | 5sp | 1sp |  |
| Camel/Donkey/Ox | 2sp | 4cp |  |
| \*Cost of the cart or wagon’s animals is included | | | |

Mercantile ventures can take many game days. Each day that adventurers have one or more ships in a berth, or one or more wagons or animals in a stable or caravanserai, they will have to pay **moorage or stabling fees**. Penurious adventurers may opt to keep their ships anchored outside of port, or keep their caravan in pasture outside the city. However, doing so substantially increases the time and cost of loading and unloading merchandise (q.v.). See the adjoining table.

EXAMPLE: Caleför wants to get in and get out of Alakyrum quickly so he decides to stable his caravan in a caravanserai that is easily accessible to the city’s warehouses. He must pay 2gp per day per wagon, so with 40 wagons his daily stabling fee is 80gp.

**Ruler’s Privilege:** Adventurers operating in a market in a domain they control need not pay moorage or stabling fees.

### Arbitrage Trading

The riskiest, but most lucrative, form of mercantile trade is arbitrage: The movement of merchandise across long distances from markets where they are cheap to markets where they are expensive. Arbitragers must identify an opportunity, front the cost of purchasing large quantities of merchandise, safely transport it across long distances to distant markets by cart or ship, and then find a buyer willing to pay enough of a premium to earn the arbitrager a profit. Because it requires large sums of treasure and risky travel across the wilderness, arbitrage is a common choice for merchant-adventurers.

Each day that a character or party engages in arbitrage trading, follow the steps below to adjudicate the outcome.

###### 1. Assess Supply and Demand

The first step to arbitrage trading is to assess supply and demand in the market in order to learn its demand modifiers. As noted above, demand modifiers affect the price for merchandise in the market. A low demand modifier indicates that there is a low demand for that type of merchandise available, usually because the market is a surplus producer of that merchandise. A high demand modifier indicates that the merchandise is hard to get and very expensive, usually because the market is an importer of that merchandise.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Assessment of Supply & Demand** | |
| **Adjusted Die Roll** | **Result** |
| 2- | False Assessment |
| 3 – 5 | Failed Assessment |
| 6 – 8 | Expertise Is Required |
| 9 – 11 | Partial Assessment |
| 12+ | Successful Assessment |

Assessing supply and demand takes time — lots of time. After all, markets in ***ACKS*** do not have Bloomberg terminals, financial newsletters, or even commodity exchange floors. Instead, the arbitrager must traffic a variety of open-air plazas, guild halls, private offices, harbor fronts, and other locations scattered across the urban settlement, listening in on price negotiations, investigating warehouses, talking to dockworkers and so on.

Assessing supply and demand counts as a dedicated activity (8 hours) in a day. During this time, the arbitrager may face random encounters in the urban settlement. Arbitragers frequently attract the attention of local cartels, criminals, tax assessors, and other unsavory types.

When the day’s activity is complete, the Judge rolls 2d6 on the Assessment of Supply and Demand table. The Judge should modify the roll by the arbitrager’s Charisma modifier.

Where appropriate, arbitragers might further modify the roll by using Diplomacy, Intimidation, or Seduction proficiencies on NPCs or by spending money on Bribery. (Assume the target of the bribes earns 100gp per month.)

If the result is a **successful assessment**, the arbitrager learns the state of supply and demand in the market. The Judge reveals the market’s complete list of demand modifiers for all 29 types of merchandise.

If the result is a **partial assessment**, the arbitrager has learned some information, but not all of it. The Judge reveals the demand modifier for 1d6 merchandise types of the arbitrager’s choice.

If **expertise is required**, the arbitrager learns the demand modifier of one type of merchandise, but only if he is an expert in that type of merchandise. To qualify as an expert, the arbitrager must have at least two ranks in an Art, Craft, or Profession proficiency related to a specific type of merchandise. If the arbitrager qualifies as an expert in two or more types of merchandise, he learns the demand modifier for each.

On a **failed assessment**, then the arbitrager does not glean any information.

On a **false assessment**, the arbitrager has been misinformed about the local economic situation. The Judge reveals the demand modifier for 1d6 merchandise types of the arbitrager’s choice (as with a partial assessment) but all of the demand modifiers are wrong!

Caleför has three ranks of Profession (salt merchant). Having arrived on 4/1/381, he spends 4/2/381 assessing supply and demand on Alakyrum. He rolls an 8. Since this is an Expertise Required result, he will earn the market’s demand modifier for salt. He cannot choose to learn the demand modifier of, e.g., precious metals because he lacks expertise. If he didn’t have Profession or a similar proficiency, he wouldn’t learn any price at all from this result.

After assessing supply and demand, the arbitrager may move to the next step (selecting merchandise to trade the next day) or repeat this step (assessing supply and demand the next day) if he wants to glean more information. Conversely, an arbitrager who has already assessed supply and demand on a prior visit, or who just wants to buy or sell at any price, can skip this step if desired.

**Splitting Up:** Sometimes (as in the example of Marcus, Quintus, and Viktir) an entire party may engage in arbitrage trading. The rules assume that normally all the characters in the party are assessing supply and demand together. If desired, party members can split up and each assess supply and demand separately. If so, they risk random encounters separately but might glean more information.

###### 2. Select Type of Merchandise

The second step to arbitrage trading is to choose a type of merchandise to trade that day. As noted above, there are 19 different types of common merchandise and 10 types of precious merchandiseavailable. The choice of what merchandise to buy or sell is up to the arbitrager.

If the arbitrager has entered the market with a cargo of specific merchandise he needs to sell, he might wish to trade in that merchandise regardless of the demand for it. Alternatively, if the arbitrager wants to buy goods, he might wish to trade in whatever has the lowest demand modifier. If he has a variety of cargo and will be visiting several markets, he might wish to sell only merchandise that has a high demand modifier. This is where correctly assessing supply and demand is important!

The Common and Precious Merchandise table, below, lists each type of merchandise; the container used to store it; the price per stone of the merchandise; the amount by which that price steps up or down when it changes; and the base number of stones available to buy or sell each day with market impact I. Amount of less than 1 stone cannot be bought or sold in arbitrage; instead, the fractional demand or supply accumulates day by day that the character solicits interest from buyers or sellers until 1 stone of supply or demand is reached.

Caleför decides to buy salt in Alakyrum to take advantage of the low demand modifier. Because Alakyrum is a Class I market, the base number of stones available per day is 1,000 at market impact 1.

**Designer’s Note:** Sometimes the Judge may want to just use a standard or generic merchandise for some purpose, such as computing the value of a random warehouse’s contents, or a quick estimate of the total quantity of goods in a village’s stores.

* Generic common merchandise has an average value of 1.1gp per stone. Each day 0.025 stone per urban family per is traded.
* Generic precious merchandise has an average value of 135gp per stone. Each day 0.00074 stone per urban family is traded.
* Generic merchandise has an average value of 3.1gp per stone. Each day 0.0168 stone per urban family is traded.
* For merchandise that is manufactured year round, there will usually be one month’s supply, e.g. 30 times daily trade.
* For merchandise that is harvested twice per year, there will usually be three (or 1d6) month’s supply.
* For merchandise that is harvested once per year, there will usually be six (or 1d12) month’s supply.

###### 3. Solicit Buyers or Sellers in Merchandise

Once the arbitrager has chosen what type of merchandise to trade in that day, the next step is to solicit buyers or sellers in that merchandise. Each type of merchandise is traded by different types of merchant. The arbitrager must find and approach these merchants by prowling through bazaars, business districts, and trade rows. Soliciting buyers or sellers for a particular type of merchandise counts as a dedicated activity (8 hours) in a day. During this time, the arbitrager may again face random encounters in the urban settlement.

Once buyers and sellers are solicited, multiply the base amount of merchandise available by the arbitrager’s market impact to determine the amount he can buy or sell.

Daily Supply / Demand from Solicitation = Base Number of Stones x Market Impact

An arbitrager can solicit for buyers and sellers every day if desired, either in the same or in a different type of merchandise. Party members can split up and each solicit interest for a different type of merchandise separately. If so, they risk random encounters separately as well. Party members cannot split up to solicit interest for buyers or sellers the sametype of merchandise without splitting up the amount of merchandise available. There are only so many buyers and sellers, and they will just end up getting smaller pieces of the same pie.

**Steady Trade Routes:** A venturer with a steady trade route for a particular type of merchandise in his market can add one-half his class level to his market impact when assessing determining the amount of merchandise of that type available for purchase or sale. If that results in his market impact exceeding the market maximum, he can advance to the next highest market class.

EXAMPLE: On 4/3/381, Caleför spends the day talking to the Alakyrum Salter’s Guild trade agent. The 6th level venturer actually has a steady trade route in salt with Alakyrum, so he adds one-half his class level to his market impact, increasing it from 2 to 5. Caleför can buy 5,000 stone of salt.

###### 4. Determine Market Price of Merchandise

Once the arbitrager has solicited buyers or sellers, he learns that merchandise’s **market price** from them. The market price for merchandise is derived from its **base price**, which represents an average value of the commodity across all markets as a whole. The base price is adjusted for the economic and political factors of the market where the transaction is occurring. These factors are modeled randomly using die rolls and situational adjustments.

The market price is the prevailing price for that market for that month, and should only be calculated once for each type of merchandise. Different merchants in the same market will not buy and sell the same type of goods at different prices unless negotiated with (see below). To determine market price, follow these steps:

* Find the merchandise’s base price on the Common or Precious Merchandise Table.
* Roll 4d4-10. If the result is positive, shift the price upward by that number of steps. If the result is negative, shift the price downward by that number of steps.
* If the demand modifier is positive, shift the price upward by that number of steps. If the demand modifier is negative, shift the price downward by that number of steps.
* If the market is a Class I or Class II, shift the price upward by one step. If the market is Class V or VI, shift the price downward by one step
* If the merchandise is “grains & vegetables” and it is currently spring (sowing season), shift the price upward by one step. If the merchandise is “grain & vegetables” and it is currently autumn (harvest season), shift the price downward by one step.
* Modify by one step in the arbitrager’s favor if he has a **steady trade route** in that type of merchandise. The Judge may also apply any special modifiers from vagaries (war, calamity, etc.).

The price that emerges from these price steps is the market price for the merchandise.

EXAMPLE: Caleför has solicited sales from the Alakyrum Salter’s Guild. The base price for a stone of salt is 0.15gp and its price step is 0.02gp. The Judge tosses 4d4-10 for a result of -1. He decreases the price by one step, to 0.13gp. Alakyrum is Class 1, so he increases the price by one step to 0.15gp. The DM for salt is -3, so he decreases the price by three steps to 0.09gp. Finally he shifts the price by one step in Caleför’s favor, since he has a steady trade route, to 0.07gp. The market price for salt in Alakyrum is currently 0.07gp per stone.

**Exhaustion of Arbitrage (Optional):** If an arbitrager stays in the same market buying or selling the same merchandise in large volume, eventually he will exhaust the opportunity for arbitrage. There is a 20% cumulative chance each day that an arbitrager is transacting in merchandise that its price will shift as a result of his efforts. If the arbitrager is buying, the price increases by one step. If the arbitrager is selling, the price decreases by one step. Once the price changes, the chance of a price shift resets to 20%. This rule should be applied at the Judge’s discretion for verisimilitude.

EXAMPLE: If Caleför were to continue soliciting sellers for salt each day, there’d be a 20% cumulative chance each day that the price increases by one step (0.02gp). Over time his continued demand for salt would raise the price and erode his margins.

**Price Reset (Optional):** At any given moment, prices reflect both the current supply and demand for merchandise as well as the expectation of future supply and demand given the information collectively known by the buyers and sellers. As circumstances change, prices change too. Prices might change because of the arrival of large caravans or fleets, the importation of goods, the harvesting of crops, changes in seasonal demand due to holidays, travel, or military deployments, etc. From the point of any individual merchant, price changes are effectively random. If the adventurers are traveling regularly between markets, the Judge can simply re-roll priceseach time the adventurers enter a new market. If the adventurers linger in the same market, assume there is a 10% cumulative chance per week of a major event occurring that causes all prices to reset.

###### 5. Negotiate the Spot Price

Most transactions occur at the market price. However, an arbitrager may wish to negotiate a higher price (if selling) or a lower price (if buying), haggling on the basis of future price trends, superior or shoddy quality, reputation, rival merchants, and so on.

Negotiation is an ancillary activity requiring one hour (6 turns). Negotiations are assumed to occur against a leading merchant, major broker, cartel representative, or other “market maker” such that the outcome affects all of the arbitrager’s purchases or sales of that merchandise that day.

A typical merchant buying or selling common merchandise has a +1 CHA bonus and one rank of Bargaining. A typical merchant buying or selling precious merchandise has a +2 CHA bonus, a +1 WIL bonus, and one rank of Bargaining. The Judge should secretly roll 1d6 when bargaining begins; if the die roll exceeds the market class of the market, the merchant the arbitrager is facing has one additional rank of Bargaining.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Reaction to Negotiation** | |
| **Adjusted Die Roll** | **Result** |
| 2- | Outraged refusal |
| 3 – 5 | Refusal |
| 6 – 8 | Negotiations continue |
| 9 – 11 | Grudging agreement |
| 12+ | Agreement |

When negotiations commence, the arbitrager rolls 2d6 on the Reaction to Negotiation table. He adds his CHA modifier (if any) to the roll but subtracts the opposing merchant’s CHA modifier (if any). The arbitrager adds a +2 bonus to his roll for each rank of Bargaining proficiency he possesses, but applies a -2 penalty to his roll per rank of Bargaining proficiency possessed by the opposing merchant.

The Judge may apply any other adjustments he feels are appropriate given the circumstances of the negotiation, the reputation of the parties, and so on. However, a natural roll of 2 always counts as 2-, and a natural roll of 12 always counts as 12+, regardless of any adjustments.

**Agreement** means that the merchant agrees to adjust the price by one price step in the arbitrager’s favor.

**Grudging agreement** means that the merchant agrees to adjust the price by one price step in the arbitrager’s favor. In exchange, however, he extracts some other concession, such as a commitment to pay a higher price on a subsequent month, a minimum volume of purchase or sale, a secondary purchase of less interesting merchandise, etc. If the arbitrager refuses this concession, then negotiations continue (as below). Even If he does agree, the arbitrager does not necessarily have to abide by any promises, though failure to do so may result in a penalties in future reaction rolls, random encounters, and so on (Judge’s discretion).

**Negotiations continue** means that the merchant has not accepted the spot price, but hasn’t flatly rejected it either. The arbitrager can halt negotiations and buy or sell at the market price or continue negotiations by rolling again. As negotiations have now become a matter of will, the arbitrager must now add his WIL modifier (if any) to the roll and must subtract the merchant’s WIL modifier.

**Refusal** means that the merchant has flatly rejected the proposed price and ended negotiations. The arbitrager can still buy from or sell to the merchant at the market price, but he can no longer negotiate for a better price with that merchant (or any other merchants that merchant was representing) that month.

**Outraged refusal** means that the merchant is so insulted by the character’s offer or negotiating strategy that he will not buy or sell with the arbitrager that month. This means the arbitrager is locked out of the market in that good that month!

EXAMPLE: Although 0.07gp per stone of salt is a good price, Caleför decides to haggle it down further. He spends one hour (6 turns) in heated negotiation with the Salter’s Guild agent. This lets him finish the negotiations on the same day, 4/3/381. Caleför has a CHA bonus of +3 and one rank of Bargaining proficiency.

The Judge quickly determines that the Salter’s Guild sales agent has a +1 CHA bonus and two ranks of Bargaining. Therefore, Caleför has a total modifier of +3 +2 -1 -4 = 0. He throws the dice and rolls a 9, achieving “grudging agreement.”

The Judge decides that the Salter’s Guild agent will ask for a minimum purchase. “We will offer a 10% price reduction, if you agree to buy at least 50% of the available supply,” says the agent. Caleför accepts, as he intended to buy all 5,000 stone anyway. The price reduction reduces the market price by another price step, to 0.05gp.

**Fixed Deal Terms:** If an arbitrager returns to transact in the same market that month to buy or sell the exact same merchandise he previously sought or bold, he uses his prior results to determine his spot price. E.g. If an arbitrager has bargained the spot price down, he cannot then bargain the spot price up in the same market in the same month.

###### 6. Exchange Merchandise for Payment

If the arbitrager and the merchant(s) come to mutually-agreeable price (either the market price or a price negotiated on the spot), they next proceed to exchange merchandise for payment.

If the arbitrager is the seller, the merchant(s) will deliver payment to the seller’s choice of bank, guild merchant, or other reputable third-party. The arbitrager will be expected to begin unloading and delivering the merchandise to the merchant(s) within a day. Once delivery is made, the arbitrager may collect payment from the bank.

If the arbitrager is the buyer, he will be expected to make payment to a bank designated by the merchant(s) within a day. The merchant(s) will begin loading the merchandise the day after payment is posted. After loading the merchandise, the merchant(s) will then collect the payment that was deposited. The arbitrager and merchant can work out a different schedule for delivery if desired.

The seller is responsible for unloading the merchandise from his caravan, fleet, or warehouse, while the buyer is responsible for loading it into his own transport. Loading and unloading merchandise is a considerable enterprise. Workers must lift and carry the various amphora, barrels, crates, and sacks, while quartermasters attend to any necessary accounting and record-keeping. Ships take even longer, as the crew must arrange and stack the cargo securely with ballast, cushions, rigging, and tying. Warehouses can only load and unload during restricted hours and are hampered by traffic.

The Cargo Handling Time and Cost table shows the manpower required to load and unload various animals and vehicles, the rate of work, and the total time required. Caravans and vessels are loaded and unloaded by their crew, while warehouses are loaded and unloaded by workers, who charge the listed fee. The buyer and seller are assumed to work in parallel, so the total time is simply the greater of the buyer’s or seller’s. If the arbitrager has kept his caravan in pasture or his ship anchored in the harbor, the time and cost are doubled for both buyer and seller.

|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cargo Handling Time and Cost | | | | |
| Type of Transport | **Crew** | **Work Rate** | **Total Time\*** | **Total Cost\*** |
| 1 pack donkey (20 st) | 1 worker | 40 st / hour | 3 turns | 0.5cp |
| 1 pack mule (40 st) | 1 worker | 40 st / hour | 1 hour | 1cp |
| 1 pack camel (60 st) | 1 worker | 40 st / hour | 1.5 hours | 1.5cp |
| 1 pack horse (80 st) | 1 worker | 40 st / hour | 2 hours | 2cp |
| 1 cart (320 st) | 2 workers | 40 st / hour | 4 hours | 8cp |
| 1 wagon (640 st) | 4 workers | 40 st / hour | 4 hours | 16cp |
| 1 barge, small (2,000 st) | 5 workers | 20 st / hour | 2.5 days | 1gp |
| 1 barge, large (9,000 st) | 10 workers | 20 st / hour | 5 days 5 hours | 4.5gp |
| 1 barge, huge (180,000) | 50 workers | 20 st / hour | 22 days 4 hours | 90gp |
| 1 sailing ship, small (10,000 st) | 12 workers | 20 st / hour | 5 days 2 hours | 5gp |
| 1 sailing ship, large (30,000 st) | 20 workers | 20 st / hour | 9 days 3 hours | 15gp |
| 1 sailing ship, huge (50,000 st) | 40 workers | 20 st / hour | 7 days 6 hours | 25gp |
| Warehouse | 10 workers | 20 st / hour | 1 hour / 200st | 1gp/100st |
| \*Doubled if loading vessels at anchor or caravans outside in pasture. | | | | |

Loading and unloading merchandise must be supervised by the arbitrager or a trusted henchman. Each character can supervise one ship or warehouse, ten boats, ten wagons, or forty ordinary animals as an ancillary activity (up to 12x if it is his only activity for the day). Unsupervised loading or unloading may result in a loss of 2d10% of the value to petty theft or other problems (Judge’s discretion).

EXAMPLE: Let’s assume Caleför solicits the Salter’s Guild on 4/4 and 4/5, with the same result, then halts due to exhaustion of arbitrage. At this point he has purchased 15,000 stone of salt at a cost of 0.05gp per stone, for a total cost of 750gp. The day after each transaction, he deposited payment with the Salter’s Guild. It will take the seller (5,000 st / 200 st) 25 hours, or 3 days, to bring salt from its warehouses to the caravan each day. So in the evening of 4/6, Caleför’s caravan receives 5,000 stone that he bought on 4/3; on the evening of 4/7, he gets the salt he bought on 4/4; and on 4/8, he gets the salt he bought on 4/5.

All of the wagons can be loaded simultaneously, so it will only take 4 hours to load the salt as it is delivered each day. Since the caravaneers load the salt in parallel with the seller’s delivery of it, that adds no additional time to the process. However, if Caleför kept his caravan outside the city, each load would have taken 6 days to deliver. That would mean Caleför would get the salt on 4/9, 4/10, and 4/11, extending his stay by three days.

Arbitragers who like to play dirty can, of course, engage in any number of shenanigans during this time, such as stealing back their own merchandise, robbing the merchant’s guild, delivering goods of shoddy quality or inadequate volume, and so on. The Judge can adjudicate such schemes at his discretion. The Hijinks rules are often useful in this regard! It’s also a time for random encounters to occur, as a fully-loaded ship or caravan that hasn’t left town is a shining target for burglars and thugs.

###### 7. Continue to Trade or Exit Market

If the arbitrager has completed all of his desired transactions, including making and/or taking delivery of any merchandise and giving and/or receiving any payments due, he can exit the market with his caravan or fleet. Before he leaves he has to pay for moorage and stabling fees he’s incurred.

If the arbitrager hasn’t yet completed all of his desired arbitrage trading, or wishes to pursue another type of mercantile venture, he can stay in the market. He could return to step 1 and assess supply and demand for another type of merchandise, return to step 2 and select a new type of merchandise to trade, or start a different type of mercantile venture altogether.

EXAMPLE: After his wagons are loaded up, Caleför heads out. He arrived on 4/1/381 and departs 4/11/381, so he has to pay stabling for 10 days. With 40 wagons stabled for 10 days, that costs (40 wagons x 2gp/wagon/day x 10 days) 800gp.

###### 8. Transport or Store Goods

If the arbitrager has purchased merchandise, he will eventually need to transport the merchandise to a new market for sale. Transporting goods should be handled as a wilderness adventure, as described in Chapter 6 under **Wilderness** **Adventures**. When the arbitrager reaches a new market, he may enter the market and engage in arbitrage trading to sell his merchandise, starting with step 1 or 2 as above.

Sometimes an arbitrager may prefer to warehouse his merchandise for later transport and/or resale. Warehouse space can be rented at a cost of 1cp per stone per month. A market typically has 50 stone per urban family of warehouse space available.

###### Arbitrage Trade Summarized

1. Arbitrager assesses supply and demand in the market to determine its demand modifiers. Depending on the success of his assessment, he learns none, some, or all of the market’s DMs. This is a dedicated activity for a day.
2. Arbitrager selects a type of merchandise to trade from the 19 common and 10 precious merchandise types. The Judge reveals the quantity of merchandise available to buy or sell.
3. Arbitrager solicits buyers and sellers interested in that type of merchandise. He multiples the quantity of merchandise available by his market impact. This is a dedicated activity for a day.
4. Judge determines the market price for that type of merchandise and reveals the price to the arbitrager.
5. Arbitrager can, but doesn’t have to, negotiate for a spot price with some or all of the interested merchants. This is an ancillary activity in a day.
6. Arbitrager can, but doesn’t have to, exchanges merchandise for payment. If buying merchandise, he must make payment within 1 day and then starts receiving his goods. If selling merchandise, he receives payment within 1 day and then must start loading the goods the next day.
7. Arbitrager can continue to trade, returning to step 1 or 2, or can exit the market. If he stays in the market, he must pay moorage and stabling fees (if any). He can store his goods in a warehouse at 1cp per stone per month.
8. Once he exits the market, arbitrager transports any merchandise he has bought to a new market.

**Designer’s Note:** These revised arbitrage trading rules have been carefully designed to play quickly. In the original ***ACKS*** rules,arbitrage trading rules, the Judge had to randomly generate a large number of merchants, then randomly determine which type of merchandise they were interested in buying or selling, and then randomly generate the number of loads they’d transact. This could be a frustrating process, as often there’d be no merchants buying or selling any of the merchandise the adventurers were interested in. The frustration couldn’t even be justified as realistic, either, because there was no guarantee the merchants would be buying and selling the merchandise the market was known for.

With these revised rules, the arbitrager (player) chooses what he wants to trade in, and the Judge only has to generate that type of merchandise. As written, the rules are concrete enough to be run in session with narrative exploration of the cityscape and role-play with each merchant, but they are also abstract enough to be resolved between sessions, too. And if the arbitrager already knows what he wants to buy or sell, has already assessed demand, and doesn’t want to haggle, the entire process can be resolved without any rolls.

### Passenger and Cargo Carriage

If an adventurer is operating a caravan of one or more wagons or a fleet of one or more vessels, he may carry passengers or cargo between markets. When a character or party wants to engage in passenger and cargo carriage, follow the steps below to adjudicate the outcome.

###### Announce Destination, Route, and Departure Time

A carrier’s first step is to announce his planned destination, route, and date of departure. The choice of destination and date is up to the carrier. Some carriers prefer to schedule frequent, short trips to nearby destinations while others plot their trips around arbitrage trading activities or adventures of exploration. Difficult or unusual routes and destinations will attract less interest from passengers and shippers, though they might permit higher fees (Judge’s discretion).

Caleför intends to travel to deliver his cargo of salt to the class II port city of Nuvië, 156 miles to the north by imperial highway. His caravan has a cargo capacity of 25,600 st, but he’s only bought 10,000 st of salt, leaving him with 15,600 st of unused cargo capacity. Since the salt won’t be fully loaded for several days, Caleför also has time available. He decides to announce a trip to Nuvië by way of the imperial highways on 4/10 so he can solicit merchants and passengers.

The planned destination, route, and departure date modify the carrier’s market impact for purposes of passenger and cargo carriage, as shown on the Destination, Route, and Departure Date table. If modifiers would increase the carrier’s market impact above the maximum for his market, it stays at the maximum. If modifiers would reduce the carrier’s market impact below 1, it drops his market class by 1 per point, and market impact is recalculated.

| --- | --- |
| **Destination, Route, and Departure Date** | |
| **Situation** | **Market Impact** |
| Destination is Class I or Class II market | +1 |
| Destination is Class III or Class IV market | 0 |
| Destination is Class V or Class VI market | -1 |
| Destination is within range of trade of current market | +1 |
| Destination is mysterious, unknown, legendary, etc. | -3 |
| Route travels exclusively on roads, rivers, and coastlines | +1 |
| Route travels through any desert, mountains, and/or ocean terrain | -1 per 24-mile hex |
| Route travels on river when sea route of equal or lesser length to same destination is available | -3 |
| Route travels on road when river route to same destination is available | -3 |
| Route travels on road when sea route to same destination is available | -8 |
| Date of departure is more than 3 days away and less than 10 days away | 0 |
| Date of departure is less than 3 days away or more than 10 days away | -1/day |
| Carrier has safely delivered passengers or merchandise on route to destination in last 30 days | +1 |

What is Caleför’s market impact for purposes of passenger and cargo carriage? As a venturer with 40 wagons, he’s currently market impact 2 in Alakyrum. His destination is a Class II market, so he gains a +1 bonus to market impact. His route is entirely along roads, adding another +1 bonus. His date of departure is 7 days away, so he has no modifier for departure date. He hasn’t delivered passengers or cargo on this route to this destination previously. Therefore his market impact is 2 +1 + 1 = 4.

###### 2. Solicit Shippers to Consign Cargo

After announcing his destination and route, the carrier can begin soliciting shippers to consign cargo for transport to his destination. Soliciting shippers counts as a dedicated activity (8 hours) in a day, and the carrier may face random encounters in the urban settlement during this time. Talking to harbormasters, negotiating with freight forwarders and shipping agents, and visiting warehouses exposes a merchant to a lot of sketchy characters!

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Cargo Consignments and Passengers** | | |
| **Market** | **Cargo** | **Number of** |
| **Class** | **Consignment** | **Passengers** |
| I | 4,000 st | 2d6+1 x 10 |
| II | 1,000 st | 6d6 |
| III | 500 st | 4d4 |
| IV | 200 st | 2d3 |
| V | 120 st | 1d4 |
| VI | 20 st | 1d2-1 |

When the activity is complete, the Judge determines the number of stone of merchandise potentially available for consignment by consulting the Cargo Consignments and Passengers table, finding the appropriate row based on the class of the market, and cross-indexing it with the row in the “Cargo Consignment” column. Multiply the total shown by the carrier’s modified market impact in the market. The result is the stones of cargo available for consignment.

Caleför spends 4/5/381 wheeling-and-dealing at the warehouses of Alakyrum. After avoiding an unpleasant random encounter, he finishes up the day’s work. The Judge consults the Cargo Consignment and Passengers table and sees that 4,000 st of consignment is typically available each day. This value is multiplied by Caleför’s effective market impact of 4 to yield 16,000 st available for consignment.

Shippers will not consign their goods to carriers they deem untrustworthy. To convert potential consignments into actual consignments, the carrier must make a reaction roll on the Contract of Carriage table. The carrier adds his Charisma and Mystic Aura modifiers. Where appropriate, arbitragers might further modify the roll by using Diplomacy, Intimidation, or Seduction proficiencies on NPCs or by spending money on Bribery. (Assume the target of the bribes earns 100gp per month.)

The Judge may apply any other adjustments he feels are appropriate given the circumstances — for instance, is the carrier’s vessel new and well-maintained, or battle-damaged and decrepit? Is his crew clean and professional, or a band of cut-throat ex-pirates? Whatever modifies are applied, a natural roll of 2 always counts as 2-, and a natural roll of 12 always counts as 12.

**Enthusiastic agreement** means that the shippers agree to consign their merchandise to the carrier without reservation.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Contract of Carriage** | |
| **Adjusted Die Roll** | **Result** |
| 2- | Jeering Refusal |
| 3 – 5 | Skepticism |
| 6 – 8 | Assurances demanded |
| 9 – 11 | Cautious agreement |
| 12+ | Enthusiastic agreement |

**Cautious agreement** means that the shippers agree to consign their merchandise to the carrier if he can prove he is a legitimate merchant. The proof required is up to the Judge but might involve showing (1) the carrier is a venturer with a steady trade route to the destination; (2) the carrier has safely made a round-trip journey to the destination within the last 30 days (or, if the journey would take longer than 30 days, as recently as practically possible); or (3) the carrier is domiciled in the current market, with a home, guild membership, and so on. (The shippers don’t want to consign their goods to someone who might just vanish into foreign lands). If none of these apply, then the shippers demand assurances instead.

**Assurances demanded** means that the shippers want assurances that carrier will safely and swiftly deliver their goods to the destination. Assurances might include depositing collateral with a bank or vault sufficient to cover the value of the merchandise if lost, purchasing insurance from the merchant guild, agreeing to hiring a mercenary company chosen by the shipper, etc. The Judge decides what assurances are demanded; the best assurances are those that make the carrier feel as nervous as the shipper! If the carrier refuses to give assurances, treat this result as skepticism instead.

**Skepticism** means that the shippers are reluctant to consign much of their merchandise to the carrier, but if the carrier is willing to reduce his rate by 10%, he can get a limited number of consignments. The Judge should re-calculate the stones of merchandise available for consignment, reducing both the market class and the carrier’s market impact by 1.

**Jeering refusal** means that the shippers find the carrier to be a contemptuous and untrustworthy sort. He receives no merchandise for consignment. Because of bad word of mouth, he cannot solicit shippers in this market again until circumstances change or a month passes.

Caleför has the opportunity to accept up to 16,000 stone of merchandise for consignment. He offers a smooth patter about his experience making the trek between Alakyrum and Nuvië, and rolls 2d6 on the Contract of Carriage table. With a +3 CHA modifier and +1 bonus for Diplomacy, he has good odds. Sadly, the dice are disagreeable, and he rolls a 3. Even with his +4 bonus, that’s only a 7 — “assurances demanded.” The shippers demand that Caleför hire the hated Imperial Vanguard to protect their cargo. Outraged, the proud adventurer refuses, thereby shifting the result to “skepticism.” The Judge re-calculates the stones of merchandise available, treating Alakyrum as being market class II instead of I and Caleför as having market impact 3 instead of 4. Multiplying 1,000 stone by market impact 3 yields 3,000 stone of merchandise ifhe will reduce his rate by 10%. Caleför begrudgingly accepts the deal.

If the adventurers intend to just deliver the cargo, its exact make-up won’t matter much and the Judge will simply assume it is a mixed shipment of exports from the region worth 1gp per stone. However, if the adventurers are less-than-savory types who might consider pirating the goods, the Judge can use the Random Merchandise table below, rolling a number of times equal to the adventurer’s market impact and evenly allocating the stones of cargo across the set of rolls.

EXAMPLE: Caleför has been consigned 3,000 st of cargo. He had a market impact of 3, so the Judge rolls three times on the Random Merchandise table. Each roll will represent (3,000 / 3 ) 1,000 st of cargo. The first roll is 68, the second roll is 26, and the third roll is 91. . The Judges determines that the shipment consists of wine (1,000 st, 190gp); salt (1,000 st, 150gp); and bronze ingots (1,000 st, 2,000gp). The total value of the consignment is 2,340gp, or 0.78gp per st.

| **Carriage Shipping Rate** | | |
| **Distance** | **Consignment** | **Passenger** |
| Road 24 miles | 1.25cp / st | 1gp / passenger |
| River 96 miles | 1.25cp / st | 1gp / passenger |
| Sea 480 miles | 1.25cp / st | 1gp / passenger |

A carrier’s rate for transporting merchandise under consignment depends on the distance and mode of travel (road, river, or sea), as shown on the Carrier Shipping Rate table. Fractional loads and distances can be calculated in terms of stone-miles. The rate is 1.25cp per 24 stone-miles by road, 1.25cp per 96 stone-miles by river, or 1.25cp per 480 stone-miles by sea or ocean.

Shippers will generally pay half when they contract for consignment and the remainder (through an agent) upon their cargo safely reaching its destination. Carriers who received less than enthusiastic agreement are also be expected to offer free passage for one (invariably nosey and annoying) merchant representative who takes care of the goods and tax payments. The representative counts as a passenger weighing 50 st.

Caleför has secured a consignment of 3,000 stone of merchandise for the 156-mile road trip to Nuvië. Caleför’s shipping rate will be (156 miles / 24 miles) x (1.25cp / st) x (3,000 st). That works out to 244gp. He has to reduce that by 10% to 220gp. He collects 110gp now and will collect the remaining 110gp in Nuvië. He needs to set aside 3,000 st for the consignment of merchandise and 50 st for the merchant representative. Since he had 15,600 st of unused cargo capacity, he’s now got 12,550 st of capacity left.

**Soliciting Shippers Again:** A carrier may spend additional time soliciting shippers to consign cargo each day.

**Splitting Up:** If desired, party members can split up and each solicit shippers separately. If so, they risk random encounters separately as well. Party members cannot split up to solicit shippers for the same trip without splitting their market impact. There are only so many shippers, and the characters will just end up getting smaller pieces of the same pie.

###### 3. Solicit Travelers to Book Passage

Before, after, or instead of soliciting merchants to consign cargo, the carrier can begin soliciting travelers to book passage to his destination. Soliciting passengers also counts as a dedicated activity (8 hours) in a day, during which the carrier may face random encounters as he visits waystations, inns, and hostels to talk to tourists, pilgrims, and wanderers.

When the activity is complete, the Judge determines the number of passengers potentially interested in booking passage by consulting the Number of Consignments and Passengers table above, finding the appropriate row based on the class of the market, and rolling the dice shown for that row in the “Number of Passengers” column. Multiply the total rolled by the carrier’s modified market class in the market.

Now Caleför turns to booking passengers. (He could keep soliciting consignment but that wouldn’t help our example.) He spends 4/7/381 soliciting travelers at venues across Alakyrum. At the day’s end, the Judge rolls to see how successful he was. Since he’s in a Class I market, the Judge rolls 2d6+1 x 10. The total is 50, which is then multiplied by Caleför’s effective market impact of 4 to yield 200 potential passengers.

As with shippers, travelers will not book passage with carriers they deem untrustworthy. To convert potential passengers into actual passengers, the carrier must make a reaction roll on the Contract of Carriage table following the rules above. The results are the same, except that they relate to passengers rather than merchandise consignments.

Caleför has the opportunity to book 320 passengers for travel to Nuvië. He again rolls 2d6 on the Contract of Carriage table and adds his +3 CHA modifier and +1 Diplomacy bonus. This time he rolls a 7, which is adjusted to 11 — “cautious acceptance.” Because Caleför has a steady trade route in salt from Alakyrum to Nuvië, the passengers book passage with him.

A carrier’s rate for transporting passengers under consignment depends on the distance and mode of travel (road, river, or sea), as shown on the Carrier Shipping Rate table. Passengers will generally pay half when they book passage and the other half upon safely reaching their destination.

Ship passengers typically sleep on the deck of the ship, and are responsible for bringing their own mess kits, blankets, bedrolls, and tents. Each passenger occupies 50 st of cargo space. In addition, the carrier is expected to provide rations (food and drink) for passengers. Rations cost 5cp and weigh 1 stone per day per passenger.

Caleför has booked 200 passengers for his caravan to Nuvië. The Judge informs him that they are pilgrims on the first leg of their journey; at Nuvië they intend to catch a vessel to Aura to climb Mt. Audarammas. Caleför grits his teeth in anticipation of days of righteous sermonizing and calculates his fee. Caleför’s shipping rate will be (156 miles / 12 miles) x (1gp / passenger) x (200 passengers), which works out to 2,600gp. He’ll collect half when they embark and half when they disembark. He needs to set aside (200 passengers x 50 st / passenger) 10,000 st for the passengers. After that, he’s got (12,400 – 10,000) = 2,400 st of capacity left in his caravan.

The venturer estimates he can reach Nuvië in 7 days of travel by road. He will need 7 x 200 = 1,400 days rations for the passengers, at a cost of 70gp and weight of 1400 stone. He has 2,400 – 1,400 = 1,000 st of capacity left.

**Soliciting Passengers Again:** A carrier may spend additional time soliciting travelers to book passage each day. A carrier may freely solicit passengers for different trips, but has to have a separate fleet or caravan or split up his market impact.

**Splitting Up:** If desired, party members can split up and each solicit travelers separately. If so, they risk random encounters separately as well. Party members cannot split up to solicit passengers for the same trip without splitting their market impact.

###### 4. Check for Chartered Travel

Sometimes a carrier may announce he’s heading in one direction, but be approached by passengers or shippers who want to go elsewhere. Anytime a carrier solicits shippers and/or travelers, the Judge rolls 1d20 and adds the carrier’s market impact to see if someone tries to charter his caravan or fleet.

If the roll is 21+, a charterer approaches the carrier at a randomly-determined date prior to his departure. The charter asks to charter the carrier’s entire caravan, fleet, or vehicle(s) to carry them and/or their goods to a distant market of their choice located 2d20 x 100 miles away from the current market. It’s up to the carrier if he wants to accept the charter.

Charterers that hire a fleet or caravan to go to a particular designation must pay as if they shipped enough to fill up the caravan or fleet’s entire cargo capacity. If the charter’s destination is 2 or more market classes smaller than the carrier’s announced destination, then the charterer must also pay for a return trip (i.e. twice the fee). Chartered travelers bring their own rations. Charterers will generally pay half in advance and the remainder upon safely reaching their destination.

**Designer’s Note:** Judges who want to encourage exploration of a huge sandbox or introduce new locations to their campaign can use chartered travel to do so. The lengthy journeys to far-off locations can become entire adventures or mini-campaigns. On the other hand, Judges who’d prefer to keep things local can skip this step without impacting the economics of mercantile ventures.

###### 5. Embark Passenger and Load Cargo

Before a carrier can depart, he has to embark his passengers and load his cargo consignments.

Passengers will arrive to board the carrier’s caravan or ships shortly before their scheduled departure. For instance, if the departure is planned for dawn, the passengers will embark during pre-dawn twilight. One or more characters representing the carrier must be on hand to manage embarking, which takes one turn (10 minutes) per 25 passengers.

Shippers will load their cargo consignments as quickly as possible. The shippers pay for the cost of delivering and loading the cargo. One or more characters representing the carrier must be on hand to oversee the cargo loading process. See the Cargo Handling Time and Cost table (q.v.).

Since embarking passengers and loading cargo can take several turns, it may trigger random encounters in the urban settlement as robbers, customs officials, and so on take an interest.

3,000 st of consignment takes 15 hours (2 days) to be delivered. With delivery beginning on 4/7, it arrives by the close of 4/9. It then takes 4 hours to load the caravan. These can all be loaded simultaneously in a day. Caleför or a henchman needs to be on hand to supervise that, so he schedules it for 4/11/381. 80 passengers will take (80 / 25) = 3 turns to embark on the morning of 4/11/381.

###### 6. Continue to Solicit or Exit Market.

If all solicitation is complete, all passengers are embarked, and all cargo is laden, the carrier can exit the market. Before he leaves he has to pay for moorage and stabling fees he’s incurred.

If the carrier hasn’t yet completed all of the above, or wishes to pursue another type of mercantile venture, he can stay in the market. He could return to step 1 and announce a different trip, return to step 2 or 3 to solicit more cargo consignments or passenger bookings, or start a different type of mercantile venture altogether.

Caleför hasn’t completely filled his caravan, but decides he doesn’t have time to make any further solicitations. On 4/11 he exits Alakyrum and starts heading towards Nuvië. (Note that we already handled his stabling fees in the earlier example under Arbitrage Trading.)

###### 7. Transport Passengers and Cargo.

Transporting passengers and cargo should be handled as a wilderness adventure, as described in Chapter 6 under **Wilderness** **Adventures**. When the carrier reaches the destination, he must enter the market in order to disembark his passengers and unload his cargo. Disembarking and unloading takes as much time as embarking and loading (q.v.). The carrier collects his remaining fees at this time. Note that the carrier is responsible for paying the toll to enter the destination market, but is not responsible for paying customs duties on cargo.

###### Passenger and Cargo Carriage Summarized

1. Carrier announces his planned destination and date of departure. Judge calculates his modified market impact.
2. Carrier solicits shippers to consign cargo to the destination. Judge determines the number of available consignments and carrier makes a reaction roll to secure the consignments. This is a dedicated activity for a day.
3. Carrier solicits travelers to book passage to the destination. Judge determines the number of potential passengers and carrier makes a reaction roll to book them. This is a dedicated activity for a day.
4. Judge checks to see if a charterer attempts to charter the carrier’s caravan or fleet.
5. Carrier embarks passengers and load cargo. Passengers count as 200 st of cargo. 1 st of food worth 0.5cp per passenger per day is required.
6. If all solicitation is complete, all passengers are embarked, and all cargo is laden, the carrier can exit the market. Otherwise, he can stay in the market, returning to any prior step. However, each day he stays in the market, he must pay moorage and stabling fees (if any).
7. Once he exits the market, the carrier transports the cargo and passengers to the agreed-upon destination, where he collects his final fee.

### Passive Investment

Characters can make passive investments in the hopes of earning returns on the investment. For simplicity, passive investments are categorized into three types — establishing businesses, funding commercial expeditions, and lending money — as well as five levels of risk — safe, cautious, balanced, risky, and perilous. The type of investment determines what sort of vagaries may occur, while the level of risk determines the **base rate of return** per month and influences the vagaries.

###### Making an Investment

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Market Class | Max Investment / Month |
| I | 100,000gp\* |
| II | 25,000gp |
| III | 10,000gp |
| IV | 5,000gp |
| V | 2,000gp |
| VI | 1,000gp |
| \*Per 20,000 families | |

To make a passive investment, the character allocates 1gp or more, and chooses the investment’s type (**business establishment**, **commercial expedition**, or **money lending**) and level of risk (**safe**, **cautious**, **balanced**, **risky**, or **perilous**).

The character must be in a market in order to make an investment. Making an investment requires one day of dedicated activity (6 hours) per 5,000gp. The maximum investment per month is determined by the market class. The adjoining table shows the maximum mercantile investment permitted each month in a market by a character.

Once a passive investment is made, the Judge will roll 1d100 on the Vagaries of Investment table each month and apply its results. Unless noted otherwise by the vagary, the character will then receive a return on his investment, equal to the current value of his investment multiplied by its current rate of return. (Both the value of the investment and the rate of return may vary over time.) To collect the return on his passive investment, the character must be in the market where he established the business and must undertake an ancillary activity (1 hour). Uncollected returns are notautomatically compounded, although characters may choose to re-invest profits into the same or a new investment. Characters do notearn XP from abstract investments.

###### Levels of Risk

**Safe investments** prioritize the protection of capital above all else. Safe investments include loaning money to chartered banks and investing in licensed guilds with local monopolies. They have a base rate of return of 0.25% per month.

**Cautious investments** seek a steady return with limited risk to capital, such as investing in civilized farms, investing in large, established businesses, and loaning money to large private landowners. They have a base rate of return of 0.5% per month.

**Balanced investments** seek a balance between return and risk, such as investing in border farms, funding short-distance mercantile ventures, and loaning money to stable realms. They have a base rate of return of 1% per month.

**Risky investments** aim for high returns, but may incur substantial losses in some years. Risky investments include investing in wilderness farms, funding long-distance mercantile ventures, loaning money to unstable or warring realms, and investing money in small businesses. They have a base rate of return of 3% per month on average.

**Perilous investments** offer very high returns at exceptional risk, such as funding adventuring expeditions, funding private military campaigns, and investing in criminal syndicates. Perilous investments have a base rate of return of 9% per month or more — but most perilous ventures will be bankrupt within a year.

###### Diversifying Risk

A character can make one investment of any type without penalty. He can make an additional investment of any type per rank in Profession (merchant). He can make an additional investment in a business establishment per rank in a proficiency related to the business. He can make an additional investment into a commercial expedition per rank of Driving or Seafaring and (if a venturer) per Steady Trade Route.

A high-level venturer can make a number additional investment into any type equal to the value of his guildhouse divided by the maximum investment in the market class where his guildhouse is located.

If the character makes investments beyond these limits, all of his businesses suffer a -10 penalty on the Vagaries of Investment table per investment past the limit. This penalty reflects the fact that the character is too distracted or ignorant of the business to be able to ensure it’s being run responsibly. Embezzling employees, shiftless business partners, and other hazards await the overextended entrepreneur! With this rule, characters are rewarded for making fewer, large investments, which is both more dramatic and easier to resolve.

EXAMPLE: Foggy is an aspiring entrepreneur in Siadanos, a Class IV market (maximum investment 5,000gp per month). He has two ranks of Profession (bawdyhouse proprietor). He can make one investment of any type (business establishment, commercial expedition, or money lending), as well as two investments in business establishments related to bawdyhouses, without penalty. Foggy, however, is a dwarf whose greed knows no limits, and he invests 5,000gp into not one, not two, but five different bawdyhouses. Therefore he suffers a penalty of (5 – 3) x -10 = -20 on all rolls on the Vagaries of Investment table.

If Foggy were a venturer with a guildhouse, he might have been able to avoid these penalties. If he had a 5,000gp guildhouse he’d have been permitted to make four investments without penalty, and if he had a 10,000gp guildhouse, he could have made all five.

**Designer’s Note:** Some players, overly schooled in modern financial theory, will have their characters invest the smallest amount of money possible in each of a dozen or more investments, thereby reducing their risk through diversity. Such tactics are not only unrealistic given the time period simulated, they greatly increase the burden on the Judge, who must make dozens of rolls each month for small amounts of wealth. These rules are designed to limit such shenanigans.

###### Liquidating an Investment

Characters can liquidate an investment to recover their capital. A safe investment can be liquidated immediately. It takes one month to liquidate a cautious investment, two months to liquidate a balanced investment, three months to liquidate a risky investment, and 1d6+3 months to liquidate a perilous investment. During that time, the character continues to earn a return and risk vagaries. It is possible to be wiped out by a bad vagary while trying to liquidate!

###### Vagaries of Investment

For each investment each month the Judge will roll 1d100 on the Vagaries of Investment table, cross-referencing the die roll, the level of risk, and the type of investment to determine the result affecting the character’s investment.

**Acclamation:** The business has gained a reputation for excellence. The business’s current rate of return is doubled this month and for the next 1d6 months. A “Disrepute” vagary cancels this vagary as soon as it occurs.

**Annihilation:** The expedition has been utterly destroyed. The character earns no return this month, and his investment is completely lost. 1d4 survivors report that the cause of the annihilation is (roll 1d8): 1 — mysterious, 2 — a rival expedition, 3 — a natural disaster, 4 — a group of monsters, 5 — an enemy army, 6 — brigands or pirates, 7 — betrayal from within, 8 — betrayal from trading partners.

**Bailout:** The debtor needs more funds. The character is asked to invest additional sums equal to the value of his investment multiplied by the percentage shown. If the character provides the bailout, he collects his return based on the new value. If he does not, he can take a “Writedown” vagary or seize the debtor’s assets in repayment. Seizing the debtor’s assets reduces the current value of the character’s investment by 2d6 x 5% and liquidates the investment.

EXAMPLE: The Zaharan ruinguard Moruvai has taken up predatory lending. He has made a perilous money-lending investment valued at 20,000gp with a base rate of return of 9% per month. The Judge rolls a “Bailout 25%” vagary. Moruvai may either lend another 4,000gp, accept a Writedown of 2d10% of his investment, or seize the debtor’s assets, losing 2d6 x 5% of his investment and liquidating it.

**Banking Fee:** The character is able to secure an additional fee from the debtor. The return on the character’s investment is increased this month by 50%. The fee is (roll 1d6): 1 — origination fee, 2 — late payment fee, 3 — legal expense, 4 — certification, 5 — appraisal, 6 — prepayment penalty.

**Bankruptcy:** The business goes bust. The character earns no return this month, and his investment is completely lost. The reason for the bankruptcy is (roll 1d10): 1 — mysterious, 2 — casualty, 3 — theft, 4 — loss of key personnel, 5 — corruption, 6 — competition, 7 — government interference, 8 – 10 — bad judgment.

**Brigandage/Piracy:** The expedition has become the target of an organized company of brigands or fleet of pirates. The expedition’s current rate of return is reduced by 33% for the next 1d6 months. The enemy will consist of NPC brigands or pirates with wages equal to half the losses they are causing. Despite their predatory nature, the brigands keep worse things at bay, so slaying them increases risk by one level (e.g. from Cautious to Balanced) for 1d6 months unless the PC takes steps to address it (Judge’s discretion). Note that this increase in risk is not matched by any increase in rate of return. A “Protector” vagary cancels this vagary as soon as it occurs.

**Calamity:** A calamity has wrecked the business’s storefront and/or inventory. The character earns no return this month, and the value of his investment is reduced by 2d6 x 5%. The calamity is (roll 1d6): 1 — arson, 2 — vandalism, 3 — burglary, 4 — riot, 5 — accidental fire, 6 — flood.

**Collateral:** The debtor deposits collateral worth 5% – 20% of the investment value with the character. In the event that the character loses any investment value in the future due to a “Default,” “Deferment,” “Bailout,” or “Writedown” vagary, the character may seize the collateral to make up for the loss. The character may also apply the value of collateral towards a bailout. The collateral is (roll 1d6): 1 — common merchandise, 2 — precious merchandise, 3 — gems, 4 — jewelry, 5 — silver, 6 — gold.

**Decimation:** The expedition has been decimated. The character earns no return this month, and the value of his investment is reduced by 2d10%. The cause of the casualties is (roll 1d8): 1 — mysterious, 2 — a rival expedition, 3 — a natural disaster, 4 — a group of monsters, 5 — an enemy army, 6 — brigands or pirates, 7 — betrayal from within, 8 — betrayal from trading partners.

**Default:** The debtor defaults and has no assets; the value of the loan must be written off completely. The character earns no return this month, and his investment is completely lost. The reason for the default is (roll 1d10): 1 — mysterious, 2 — casualty, 3 — theft, 4 — loss of key personnel, 5 — corruption, 6 — competition, 7 — debt jubilee, 8 – 10 — bad judgment.

**Deferment:** The debtor is unable to make payments and has asked to defer payment on his loan. If the character agrees, he earns no return this month or for the next 1d6 months. Do not roll vagaries during this time. If the character refuses, he may seize the debtor’s assets in repayment. The current value of his investment is reduced by 2d6 x 5% and then the investment is liquidated.

**Delay:** The expedition has been gotten lost, become imprisoned, had its inventory impounded, or otherwise held up. The character earns no return this month. If the expedition attempts to escape or push ahead, reduce the value of its investment by 2d6 x 5%. Otherwise, the character earns no return for the next 1d6 months, during which time no vagaries occur. The cause of the delay is (roll 1d8): 1 — mysterious, 2 — lost in wilderness/at sea, 3 — halted by inclement weather, 4 — held up at customs, 5 — imprisoned by government, 6 — captured by brigands or pirates, 7 — inventory impounded, 8 — internal crisis.

**Discovery:** The expedition has unearthed something of great worth. The current value of the character’s investment is increased by the percentage shown (2d10%, 2d6 x 5%, or 100%), or the discovery may lead to an adventure (Judge’s discretion). The discovery is (roll 1d6) 1 — a treasure map, 2 — buried treasure, 3 — a hidden urban settlement, 4 — a new trade route, 5 — the confirmation of a legend, 6 — a place of power.

**Disrepute:** The character’s business has fallen into disrepute due to slander by the competition, shady business practices, or just bad luck. The business’s rate of return is halved this month and for the next 1d6 months. This vagary can be cumulative in its impact, halving the rate of return each time it occurs. An “Acclamation” or “Patron” vagary cancels this vagary as soon as it occurs.

**Extension:** The debtor is unable to make his payment this month and asks for an extension. If the character agrees, the amount will be paid in 1, 2, or 3 months, as noted. If the character refuses, he may seize the debtor’s assets in repayment. The current value of his investment is reduced by 2d6 x 5% and then the investment is liquidated.

**Fee:** The business suffers a burdensome fee equal to 2d10% of the value of its investment. The fee is (roll 1d6) 1 — tariff, 2 — fine/penalty, 3 — legal expense, 4 — liturgy, 5 — licensing fee, 6 — bribery or extortion by magistrates. If the business is in a domain ruled by the character, this vagary can be ignored if desired.

**Maturation:** The debtor’s creditworthiness has substantially improved. All future rolls on the Vagaries of Investment table are made as if the investment were one level less risky. Note that this decrease in risk is not matched by any decrease in rate of return.

**Monopoly:** The expedition has gained a monopoly over its services. The monopoly is both local and temporary, but the expedition’s current rate of return is doubled this month and for the next 1d6 months. A “Rival” vagary cancels this vagary as soon as it occurs.

**Patron:** The business has secured the patronage of a powerful or important customer. If the business is suffering from a “Disrepute” or “Racket” vagary, those are immediately cancelled. For the next 1d6 months, the business’s rate of return is increased by 33% due to the patron’s generous contribution and referrals. If an adventurer openly owns the business, the patron may be interested in the adventurer in some way (Judge’s discretion). The patron is (roll 1d10) 1 — magistrate, 2 — senator, 3 — merchant, 4 — master craftsman, 5 — specialist, 6 — fighter, 7 — thief, 8 — mage, 9 — crusader, 10 — unusual (Judge’s choice).

**Principal:** The value of the investment has increased due to changes in the market. After collecting this month’s return, the character may immediately increase the current value of his investment by 2d10% and liquidate the investment if desired. If the character does not liquidate the investment, however, the value is not increased.

**Protector:** The expedition has garnered the protection of a powerful and authoritative figure in the region. If the expedition is suffering from a “Brigandage/Piracy” vagary, it is immediately cancelled. For the next 1d6 months, the expedition can ignore any “Annihilation,” “Delay,” “Decimation,” or “Brigandage/Piracy” vagaries it suffers. If an adventurer openly owns the expedition, the protector may be interested in the adventurer in some way (Judge’s discretion). The protector is (roll 1d6): 1 — a ruler, 2 — a military commander, 3 — a notorious brigand or buccaneer, 4 — a famous adventurer, 5 — a powerful monster, 6 — unusual (Judge’s choice).

**Racket:** The business has become the target of an organized criminal protection racket. The business’s current rate of return is reduced by 33% for as long as the racket continues. The racketeers will consist of NPC ruffians with wages equal to half the losses they are causing. Slaying the racketeers earns the ire of the local syndicate and increases risk by one level (e.g. from Cautious to Balanced) for 1d6 months unless the PC takes steps to address it (Judge’s discretion). Note that this increase in risk is not matched by any increase in rate of return. If the local syndicate is under the character’s control, this vagary represents a rival syndicate trying to take a cut of the action. A “Patron” vagary cancels this vagary as soon as it occurs.

**Repayment:** The debtor has come into funds and is able to repay any late payments that may have resulted from an “Extension” vagary. In addition, if payment is currently being deferred due to a “Deferment” vagary, that vagary is cancelled.

**Return (±%:):** The investment yields a return. If no modifier is listed, the return is equal to the current rate of return; there is no other vagary. If modified by a positive number, the return is increased by the relative percentage shown this month. If modified by a negative number, the return is decreased by the number shown this month, possibly yielding a negative return (loss). Losses can be paid by the character or deducted from the investment value.

EXAMPLE: A risky investment with a current rate of return of 3% will yield -3% on “Return -200%”, 0% on “Return -100%”, 4.5% on “Return +50%” and 9% on “Return +200%”.

**Rival:** The expedition is facing competition from a cut-throat rival that will stop at nothing to bring them ruin. The expedition’s rate of return is halved this month and for the next 1d6 months. This vagary can be cumulative in its impact, halving the rate of return each time it occurs. A “Monopoly” vagary cancels this vagary as soon as it occurs.

**Windfall (%):** An unexpected windfall yields fiscal rewards. The current value of the character’s investment is increased by the percentage shown (2d10%, 2d6 x 5%, or 100%). The windfall is (roll 1d6): 1 — an inheritance, 2 — a property appreciation, 3 — a business innovation, 4 — the failure of a competitor, 5 — an expectedly successful advertisement 6 — of mysterious origin.

**Writedown:** Market conditions are such that the character will never be able to recoup the full value of his loan completely. The character earns no return this month, and the value of his investment is reduced by 2d6 x 5%.

## Sanctums and Dungeons

A mage can build a **sanctum** to attract 1d6 companions of 1st – 3rd level each, plus 2d6 apprentices of 0th level. The Intellect scores of the apprentices will be at least 9 (discard any rolls of 8 or less). In order to advance to 1st level, a 0th level apprentice must engage in magical research for one year and then make a research throw of 18+ (modified by INT). If the throw succeeds, the apprentice advances to 1st level. If the throw fails on an unmodified 1-3, the apprentice becomes discouraged by his inaptitude for magic and leaves the mage’s service. On any other result, the apprentice fails to advance in level but continues his studies. Each year the mage dwells in his sanctum, he can attract an additional 1d6 0th level apprentices, until he has a maximum of 6 companions of 1st level or higher and 12 apprentices of 0th level studying at any one time.

### Constructing a Dungeon

Many mages devote their later careers to magical research. This vocation demands a constant supply of rare components, generally monster parts, such as the fangs of 20 hellhounds or skulls of 50 ogres. Rather than squander their time hunting beasts for these components, a mage can build a **dungeon** within his domain with the aim of luring monsters to lair within. There they can be harvested at the mage’s leisure. The following rules govern the creation of such dungeons.

A dungeon is constructed using the Structure Costs listed in Chapter 4 (p. XX). There are no restrictions on the dungeon’s size (other than what the mage can afford) and a mage can construct multiple dungeons if desired. A mage’s dungeon(s) need not be in the same hex as his stronghold but must be within the area secured by the mage’s stronghold value (see p. XX). A mage can, but does not have to, establish a domain before, as, or after he builds a dungeon. Dungeons work best when they are in wilderness hexes with terrain favorable to monsters, such as forests, swamps, and mountains.

The value of a dungeon does not count towards Minimum Stronghold Value unless it is used to secure a chaotic domain such as a beastman clanhold.

### Populating a Dungeon

After the dungeon is completed, the Judge will determine the rate at which wandering monsters begin to arrive in the dungeon (as detailed in the ***ACKS II Judge’s Journal,* p. XX)**. Wandering monsters that arrive have a percentage chance of establishing a lair in the dungeon determined by their Lair entry.

If desired, the mage can seed the dungeon with treasure to help entice the monsters to stay. If a monster finds unclaimed treasure equal to or greater than the average for its Treasure Type (as explained in the ***ACKS II Judges Journal***), the monster’s chance of making its lair within the dungeon is doubled. Monsters without a Treasure Type simply do not care about treasure, so it has no effect on them. Wandering monsters do not normally have any treasure of their own.

Wandering monsters who establish a lair will choose the best available room or area within the dungeon appropriate for their size, displacing any less powerful monsters already in that area (and taking their excess treasure, if any). Monsters generally prefer to be deeper in dungeons where possible, as the depth gives added security. As a result, the more powerful monsters with the most treasure will generally be deep within the dungeon, with progressively weaker monsters closer to the entrance.

When 1/3 of the areas in the dungeon have monsters lairing within them, the dungeon becomes full. The remaining rooms will be buffer zones between the different creatures. Any future monsters that arrive will displace weaker creatures out of the dungeon entirely, unless they are the sort of creature which would prefer to subjugate the current denizens (Judge’s discretion). For instance, a dragon might enslave kobolds rather than displace them.

Sometimes the Judge’s encounter throws might indicate that NPC men, dwarves, or elves have arrived. These results mean that adventuring parties have come to clear the dungeon! Such encounters are best resolved by having the player whose mage owns the dungeon run a one-off session with the rest of the group playing as the wandering adventurers. The dungeon-owning mage may, of course, intervene personally when his dungeon is invaded.

### Peasants and Dungeons

Like fighters, crusaders, and most other classes (but unlike thieves), the domain around the mage’s stronghold can become settled by peasant families seeking his protection and leadership. Some mages do not want the burden of rulership and drive off any peasants who attempt to settle in their land. Others, whoever, welcome the peasant families as a source of labor and revenue.

However, peasant families can be demoralized if the mage builds a dungeon and does not protect the peasants from the monsters therein. If maintaining a secure peasant population is important to him, the mage can increase his monthly garrison expenditure of gold pieces. Total the experience point value of the monsters in the dungeon and divide that total by the number of peasant families (rounded up). The quotient represents the required increase in monthly garrison. If the mage fails to pay this, his domain morale will decrease by 1 per gp/family.

EXAMPLE: Quintus’ domain has 1,100 peasant families. It also is home to a sinister dungeon with a cyclops (2,400xp), 6 ogres (1,290xp), and 60 orcs (600xp), for 4,290xp total. 4,290xp/1,100 families is 3.9, rounded to 4, so Quintus’ garrison cost is increased by 4gp per peasant. Being a stingy archmage, Quintus opts to only spend an extra 3gp per peasant (3,300gp). His domain morale decreases by 1.

If desired, mages may actually hire the monsters in their dungeon to serve as the garrison. This will cause a -2 domain morale penalty if the monsters are Chaotic and the peasants are not. Mages with beastmen peasant families (see **Clanholds**) do not need to increase their garrison because of dungeons, unless the dungeon’s inhabitants are Lawful.

### Harvesting a Dungeon for Monster Parts

It is up to the mage how he harvests the monsters within his dungeon. Some mages prefer to hire low-level adventurers to enter their dungeons to gather particular components. For instance, a mage might offer 140gp per ogre skull to adventurers exploring the maze he has created. Other mages may **bewitch**the monsters, stage gladiatorial battles among them, or simply kill the old and weak. Some Chaotic mages harvest adventurers…

Note that a mage receives no experience for seizing his own treasure back from monsters, but wandering adventurers who seize treasure from the mage’s dungeon receive experience points normally.

### Extracting Arcane Power from a Dungeon

Mages of 9th level or higher who control a dungeon may, in some circumstances, be able to extract **arcane power** from the monsters in the dungeon. Arcane power is measured in gp value equivalent and can be used to pay for the component cost of magical research performed by the spellcaster when he is in the dungeon’s vicinity (i.e. the same 6-mile hex).

###### Defining the Dungeon

Since precisely what constitutes a “dungeon” can be open to question, the mage must define the dungeon as an area (measured in square feet). The area must be contiguous. If the dungeon is multi-level, each level’s square footage must be counted separately. The mage’s sanctum (or at least his library, workshop, mortuary, and/or crossbreeding laboratory) do not have to be in the dungeon, but must be within its vicinity (the same 6-mile hex) in order to benefit from arcane power.

###### Attuning to the Dungeon

After defining the dungeon’s area, the mage must become attuned to it. If the mage has personally funded and overseen the construction of the dungeon, he is automatically attuned to it when it is completed.

If he has conquered or otherwise taken control of an existing dungeon, he can become attuned to it by residing in the dungeon’s vicinity, not leaving the 6-mile hex for any reason for one month, and visiting the dungeon for at least one hour per 30,000 square feet each day. Each hour counts as an ancillary activity for the day. At the end of the month, the spellcaster must make a successful magic research throw with a penalty of -1 per 5,000 square feet of dungeon area. If the throw succeeds, the spellcaster has become attuned to the dungeon.

Once attuned to the dungeon, the mage remains attuned until (a) he voluntarily relinquishes his attunement, (b) he attunes to another dungeon, (c) he leaves the dungeon’s vicinity for more than a month, or (d) is slain. Only one spellcaster can be attuned to any given dungeon (and any overlap is sufficient to prevent attunement). If another spellcaster is attuned to it, that spellcaster’s attunement must first be extinguished before a new spellcaster can attune.

###### Establishing Sovereignty over the Dungeon

In order to extract arcane power from the dungeon’s inhabitants, the mage must establish sovereignty over them. The inhabitants must worship, dread, and/or fear the spellcaster as if he were nigh god! A mage might establish sovereignty in a number of ways:

* If the mage rolls 12+ on a reaction roll modified by Intimidation or Mystic Aura, he establishes sovereignty over the creature or creatures affected by the roll;
* If the mage successfully recruits a tribal chieftain (or similar leader) as a henchmen, he establishes sovereignty over the chief and his tribe; and/or
* If the mage slays the most powerful monster in the dungeon, and the slaying is known to be by him, he establishes sovereignty over the other monsters in the dungeon, provided they are of lower HD than the spellcaster and the slain monster.

The Judge can permit other methods using the above as guidelines. Only one mage can be sovereign over a dungeon. If new monsters arrive, the mage must establish sovereignty over them if he is to extract arcane power from them.

###### Extracting Arcane Power

Each day, the mage extracts arcane power equal to 2% of the XP value of the monsters inhabiting the dungeon over whom he has sovereignty. Arcane power is ephemeral and cannot be stored. It must be spent within the month it is accumulated.

EXAMPLE: Quintus’ domain is home to a sinister dungeon with a cyclops (2,400 XP), 6 ogres (1,290 XP), and 60 orcs (600 XP), for 4,290 XP total. He has sovereignty over all of them. Therefore, Quintus gains (.02gp / XP x 4290 XP) = 85gp value per day, or 2,550gp value per month, of arcane power that he can use for magic research.

###### Arcane and Divine Power Conflict

Nothing prohibits a mage from calling a local town his “dungeon,” terrifying the peasants, and extracting arcane power from them. However, deities and their associated clergy do not appreciate having their worship usurped. Mages who seek to extract arcane power from human and demi-human realms will certainly be confronted by the servants and soldiers of the gods.

A mage who establishes his sovereignty over a dungeon can be served by a crusader who also extracts divine power from the same creatures. (Mathematically, this is because a crusader takes 10% of a creature’s divine power, 10% of its divine power remains in its corpse, and the god takes the other 80%.)

EXAMPLE: Imagine that instead of various beastmen, Quintus’s “dungeon” is actually a settlement of 200 families, for a total of 1,000 peasants (5,000 XP total). Quintus collects (.02gp x 5000 XP) = 100gp per day of arcane power, or 700gp per week. Quintus’s friend Balbus serves as the chaplain for the settlement. Balbus collects 4gp of divine power per 10 families per week, or (200 families x 4gp / 10 families) = 80gp per week. In total, 780gp per week is “extracted” from the peasants. For more information, see ***Appendix C: Cosmology*** in ***ACKS II Judges Journal.*** Yes, you can use these rules to become a god.

**Magic research projects** include researching spells, scribing scrolls, brewing potions, crafting charged and permanent magic items, crossbreeding monsters, creating necromantic servants, designing and building constructs, and learning and casting ritual spells. The exact type of research projects a character can undertake is determined by his class, level, and proficiencies.

Every research project has a **component cost**, a **material cost**, anda **research cost**, each measuredin gold pieces. In most cases the three costs are equal, such that a project’s material cost equals its component cost equals its research cost. This shared value is often called the research’s **base cost**. The material cost, research cost, component cost, and any other requirements are determined by the type of magic research and the power of magic involved.

EXAMPLE: A For example, a **scroll of slumber** has a base cost of 500gp. Its material, component, and research cost are each 500gp. A while a **sword +1** has a base cost of 5,000gp. Its material, component, and research costs are each 5,000gp.

The component cost is paid in kind with special components. Usually these are monster parts containing magical power. The component cost represents the means by which magical energy is affixed to the project. The exact nature of the components required will vary by project. The component cost of a **sword +1**might be paid with the iron slag of an iron golem worth 5,000gp. The component cost is paid at the end of the project.

The material cost is paid by coin or in kind with precious materials. Rare woods, noble metals, such as silver, gold, and platinum, and precious gems, such as rubies and diamonds, retain magic better than common woods, crude metals, or simple stone. Likewise, masterful craftsmanship that achieves the golden ratios of balance and symmetry is more useful for magic than clumsy or shoddy work. The exact nature of the material cost will vary by project. The material cost of a **sword +1** might include the cost of a masterwork blade, a jeweled pommel, a gilded tip, and so on, all costing a total of 5,000gp. The material cost is paid at the beginning of the project.

The research cost is “paid” by the labor of a **magic researcher** and possibly one or more **research assistants**. The research rate is paid over the course of the project. Each day, each participating character contributes a gp value of research towards the research cost. This amount is known as the **research rate**. A character’s research rate is determined by his caster level, as shown on the adjoining table. The sum of the research rates of all the participating characters on the project is the **total research rate**.

Undertaking magic research counts as a strenuous dedicated activity each day. A researcher can undertake magic research as an ancillary activity but only applies 1/8 his research rate. A researcher can undertake magic research as both dedicated and ancillary activities, but doing so counts as overtime and causes the researcher to become **fatigued**.

EXAMPLE: Elaria is a 9th level elven wizard with a research rate of 600gp per day. She is assisted by her henchman Irial, an elven courtier with a research rate of 25gp per day. The pair are scribing a scrollwith a research cost of 2,500gp. Each day, Elaria and Irial contribute 625gp towards the research cost. After four days of research, they have contributed 625 x 4 = 2,500gp so they have completed the project.

If Elaria had worked alone, her research rate would have been 600gp per day. After four days, she would have contributed 2,400gp towards the research cost, leaving (2,500gp – 2,400gp) 100 gp in research cost unpaid. On the fifth day, she uses two ancillary activities (two hours) to complete the project.

Some research projects also require a **magic research throw** to succeed. The magic research throw is made after the component cost, material cost, and research cost have been paid. To make a magic research throw, the researcher rolls 1d20 and compares the result to the table above. A result that is greater than or equal to themagical research target value listed for the researcher’s level indicates the task has been a success. The researcher adds his Intellect bonus to the die roll, and if he has the Magical Engineering proficiency he may add his proficiency rank. An unmodified die roll of 1 – 3 is always a failure when conducting magical research, however. When a magic research throw fails, all the time, money, materials, and components spent on the research are lost.

In some cases, the researcher may **experiment**. Experimenting always requires a magic research throw, and can have a wondrous or disastrous results. See **Experimentation** later in this chapter.

### Component Cost

When a monster dies, a residue of its soul will linger in some its body parts, such as organs and bodily fluids. These body parts are known as **special components** and can be tapped by spellcasters to power the creation of magic items or the casting of ritual spells. Powerful mages and clerics often send parties of adventurers on quests to slay certain monsters and return with the monsters’ special components. The ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual***lists the special components for each monster in the game as well as the type of magic that component can be used for.

However, sometimes a caster might want to perform magic research for which he doesn’t have a sufficient amount of the appropriate components. The caster can instead pay part or all of the component cost with:

* Arcane power (p. XX) or divine power (p. XX);
* The component cost of an identified magic item for which the caster has the formula (p. XX);
* Miscellaneous components purchased on the market (p. XX); or
* Special components from an inappropriate monster.

The caster suffers a -1 penalty on his throw per level of the spell or effect when using inappropriate or miscellaneous special components in magical research. If the caster uses a blend of the required components and inappropriate or miscellaneous components, the penalty is reduced. Multiply the penalty by the percentage of inappropriate or miscellaneous components. Round the penalty up, with a minimum -1 penalty.

EXAMPLE: Süreus is scribing a **scroll of fireball***.* His research requires 1,500gp worth of greater hellhound fangs. Unfortunately, he has only 500gp worth of fangs so he substitutes 1,000gp of ogre hearts instead. *Fireball* is a 3rd level spell. Süreus suffers a penalty of (-3 x 1000/1,500) = -2. If he used only ogre hearts, the penalty would be -3. If he used 1,000gp of fangs the penalty would be -1.

Note that if any inappropriate or miscellaneous components are used to pay the component cost of a project, the caster cannot benefit from following a formula for that project. A caster can still benefit from following a formula if he pays the component cost arcane power, divine power, or an identified magic item for which he has the formula.

Components are always consumed when used in magic research, whether they be miscellaneous components, identified magic items, etc.

### Research Assistants

Because their magic is a learned art rather than a miracle of faith, studious spellcasters can benefit by working collegially. A studious spellcaster of at least 5th level can manage one **research assistant** plus an additional assistant for each point of his Intellect bonus.

Each research assistant can either directly aid his researcher on the researcher’s own project, or he can work on a semi-independent project under the researcher’s supervision.

* When an assistant directly aids his researcher, he adds his research rate to the project’s total research rate. (In the earlier example, Irial worked as a research assistant to Elaria.)
* When an assistant works on a separate project under his researcher’s supervision, he functions as the researcher for that project. The assistant must have a formula or sample to work from for the project. The project’s research rate is determined by the assistant’s level.

To directly aid a researcher on spell research or item creation, a research assistant must be at least 1st level. To work semi-independently on spell research, brewing potions, or scribing scroll, a research assistant must be at least 3rd level. To work semi-independently on charged or permanent item creation, a research assistant must be at least 7th level.

### Proficiencies and Powers

Some proficiencies and powers may affect magic research.

###### Alchemy

A character with one rank of Alchemy proficiency counts as a 1st level mage for purposes of brewing potions or gains a +1 bonus to alchemy-related magic research throws if already of higher caster level. He gains a research rate of 5gp for alchemy or increases his existing research rate by 5%.

A character with two ranks of Alchemy counts as 3rd level mage for purposing of brewing potions or gains a +2 bonus to alchemy-related magic research throws if already of higher caster level. He gains a research rate of 15gp for alchemy or increases his existing research rate by 10%.

A character with three ranks of Alchemy counts as a 5th level mage for purposes of brewing potions or gains a +3 bonus to alchemy-related magic research throws if already of higher caster level. He can supervise other spellcasters or alchemists brewing potions. He gains a research rate of 50gp for alchemy or increases his existing research rate by 15%.

###### Art/Craft

A mastery of the mundane arts and crafts enables a researcher to focus on the esoteric aspects of his research. When performing Magic Experimentation relating to his Art or Craft proficiency (as determined by the GM), a character can add his ranks in the proficiency to his throw exclusively for purposes of determining whether he has achieved a breakthrough. In addition, a character with 4 ranks in Art or Craft gains one additional experimental advantage any time his experiment relates to his Art or Craft.

###### Other Proficiencies and Powers

**Black Lore of Zahar:** The character’s eligibility to conduct research into death magic and necromancy is determined as if he were two caster levels higher than actual. He gains a +2 bonus on magic research throws and increases his research rate by 10% when researching death magic and necromancy.

**Bright Lore of Aura:** The character’s eligibility to research protection magic is determined as if he were two caster levels higher than actual. He gains a +2 bonus on magic research throws and increases his research rate by 10% when researching protection magic.

**Loremastery:** The character can identify magic items as if he were a 5th level mage. If the character can already identify magic items, he can do so with a +2 bonus to his magic research throw and +10% bonus to his research rate.

**Magical Engineering:** For each rank of Magical Engineering, the character gains a +1 bonus on magic research throws and increases his research rate by 5%. The bonus applies when brewing potions and stacks with Alchemy.

**Mastery of Conjuration & Summoning:** The character’s eligibility to research summoning magic is determined as if he were two caster levels higher than actual. He gains a +2 bonus on magic research throws and increases his research rate by 10% when researching summoning magic.

**Mastery of Enchantments & Illusions:** The character’s eligibility to research enchantment and illusion magic is determined as if he were two caster levels higher than actual. He gains a +2 bonus on magic research throws and increases his research rate by 10% when researching enchantment and illusion magic.

**Transmogrification:** The character’s eligibility to research transmogrification magic and create crossbreeds is determined as if he were two caster levels higher than actual. He gains a +2 bonus on magic research throws and increases his research rate by 10% when researching transmogrification magic and creating crossbreeds.

### Researching Spells

###### Researcher Requirements

Spell research can be undertaken by a spellcaster of 5th level or higher to gain the formula to a common spell that he lacks access to from scrolls or spell books or in order to create the formula to a new spell. When creating a new spell, the spellcaster must describe in detail the kind of spell he wants to create, and the effects it will have. The Judge will then determine if the spell can be created, and if so what the spell level will be*.* Esoteric spells cannot be researched without experimental breakthroughs (p. XX).

The researcher must be capable of casting spells of the spell level of the spell he is researching. After completing spell research, a studious spellcaster gains the formula to the spell. He can then add it to his repertoire by spending one week of practice if desired.

Prayerful divine casters cannot research spells. A prayerful caster who faces an urgent need can pray to his deity to replace a particular spell on his class list with one normally not available to him, but such prayers are rarely granted except to the most powerful casters in times of urgent need for the faith.

###### Cost Requirements

**Component Cost:** None

**Material Cost:** 1,000gp per spell level

**Research Cost:** 1,000gp per spell level

###### Magic Research Throw Requirements

No magic research throw is required to gain the formula to a common spell. A magic research throw is required to create the formula to a new spell. The target value of the throw is increased by the level of the spell.

**Designer’s Note**: The rules are deliberately ambiguous as to what counts as a “common” spell. We’ve left it up to each Judge to decide which spells are common based on how secretive magic-users are in his campaign world. Depending on the campaign, common spells might include every spell published by Autarch in official books, only the spells found in this book, or only spells found on a customized list created by the Judge. Common spells might even be different for different classes, races, or regions. Remember, every campaign is a law unto itself!

###### Other Requirements

**Library:** To research a spell, a researcher must have access to a **library**. Wizard’s guilds often will provide their mages access to such a library. If a spellcaster wishes to compile his own library, a minimum of 4,000gp must be invested to allow research on 1st level spells. For each subsequent spell level to be researched, another 2,000gp must be invested.

Having an exceptionally large library aids research. For every 10,000gp of value above the minimum required for the spell, the spellcaster receives a +1 bonus on his magic research throw (up to a maximum +3 bonus).

Every time a researcher successfully researches a spell, 10% of the gold spent for that effect is added to his library value, reflecting the value of notes and annotations made during research. Authoritative tomes or rare books found as treasure might provide an additional bonus to research specific spells or types of spells.

Two or more researchers can share the same library. When calculating the bonus from large library size, divide the total value of the library by the number of researchers using it using it for different projects. However, regardless of the number of researchers, use the total value of the library to determine the maximum level of spells that can be researched there.

### Creating Magic Items

###### Researcher Requirements

At 5th level, spellcasters may scribe scrolls and brew potions. At 9th level, they may create other types of magic items, such as rods, rings, and swords. In order to create a magic item, the spellcaster must have the spell(s) that replicate the magic item’s effect in his repertoire, or must find a sample or formula of the item. If a magic item has an effect that does not compare to any existing spell, the spellcaster must either research a new spell that will produce the desired effect, or he must find a sample or formula of the item.

An arcane spellcaster may make any type of magic item except those with healing effects. A divine spellcaster may only make items his class is eligible to use. For instance, a 9th level bladedancer could create a **sword +1**, **leather armor +1**, or **staff of healing**, but not a **bow +1** or **wand of fireball**. Casters cannot create activated or permanent items with esoteric spells unless experimenting (p. XX).

###### Cost Requirements

The component, material, and research costs are shown on the table below. The Effect Types are clarified after the table.

|  |  |  |  |

| \*But not more than 1/day; \*\*But not more than 1/hour | | | |

**Effect Types:** Different types of effects have different restrictions.

* A **one-use effect** typically may only be imbued in a potion or a scroll. Its duration, caster level, usage requirements, and usage time are determined by the type of item. Otherwise, count it as a single-use miscellaneous charged item as below. Examples: **potion of healing**,**scroll of fireball***.*
* A **charged effect** may be imbued in any type of non-consumable item. Its caster level, usage requirements, and usage time are determined by the type of item. If a charged item has multiple spell effects powered by the same charges, use the base cost for the highest-level spell effect, plus half the cost for each other spell effect. There are four types of charged items:
  + **Wands:** Wands are 1’ to 2’ long batons that weigh 1/6 stone. When created a wand must have at least 10 and no more than 20 charges. The effects of a wand are at minimum caster level +1 for the effect. Wands can only be used by arcane spellcasters.
  + **Rods:** Rods are 2’ to 4’ long shafts that weigh 3/6 stone. When created a rod must have at least 6 and no more than 12 charges. The effects of a rod are at minimum caster level +2 for the effect. Rods can be used by either or both arcane or divine spellcasters, as decided by the creator.
  + **Staffs:** Staffs are 6’ long, 2” thick poles that weigh 1 stone. When created a staff must have at least 15 and no more than 30 charges. The effect of a staff are at minimum caster level +3 for the effect. Staffs can be used by either or both arcane or divine spellcasters, as decided by the creator.
  + **Miscellaneous:** Any other items made as charged items must weigh at least 1/6 stone. The effects of a miscellaneous charged item are at minimum caster level for the effect. Miscellaneous charged items can be used by either or both arcane or divine spellcasters, or by specific classes, as decided by the creator.
* An **activated effect** can be imbued in any type of non-consumable item. Any spell effect can be imbued as an activated effect. An activated effect can be **dispelled***,* but the item’s user can reactivate the effect subject to its usage limits. Examples: **crystal ball**.
* An **at-will effect** can be imbued in any type of non-consumable item. A spell effect can only be imbued into an at-will item if it has a duration of concentration. Instantaneous or limited duration effects cannot be made at-will! An at-will concentration effect can be **dispelled**, but the item’s user can reactivate the effect the following round. Example: **helm of telepathy**.
* A **permanent effect** can be imbued in any type of non-consumable item. Unlike other effects, a permanent effect cannot be **dispelled**even temporarily. A spell effect can only be imbued permanently if it has a duration of at least 1 turn (10 minutes) and if it only targets the wearer(s) or user(s) of an item while it is worn or used. The cost of imbuing a permanent effect is based on the duration of the spell effect used. For example, to permanently imbue a spell with a 12 turn duration would require a component cost of 500gp x spell level x 24, as its duration is more than 1 hour, but less than 1 day. Examples:**gauntlets of ogre strength, witch’s broom**.
* A **permanent bonus** can be imbued into armor, shields, and weapons. 5 darts or 20 arrows, bolts, and slingstones can be enchanted as one item. If the weapon or armor has a bonus that is restricted to a particular class or type of opponents, the extra bonus is half price. If the weapon or armor is enchanted with spell-like effects, the spell-like effects are enchanted separately using the cost and time for charged or permanent effects. Permanent bonuses cannot be **dispelled**.

At the Judge’s discretion, ritual effects imbued into an item may violate these limits.

**Component Cost:** The Judge determines the special components required for each item. If a character does not have a formula when he begins creating the item, he will not learn the components required until 50% of the labor cost has been paid. Usually the component cost for magic items must be paid with various monster parts from one or more monsters with a total XP value equal to the gp cost of the research.

Different formulas for the same item may require different components. For instance, one formula for a **wand of fireball** might require the fangs of 20 hellhounds, while another formula for a **wand of fireball** might require the ichor of four efreeti.

**Reducing Cost with Drawbacks:** Some magic items may carry **drawbacks** that hamper or limit the user of the item. Drawbacks should be assigned a cost based on their effect level and frequency. The cost of the drawback is subtracted from the costs of the item. Drawbacks may be a constant hazard from carrying or using an item, or may occur with the same frequency as the use of the item itself. If a drawback is a constant trouble, the discount is equal to the drawback’s cost as an effect; if the drawback only occurs when an item is activated, the discount is a max of half the costs of the effect which the drawback applies to.

An item can have a total max discount (from any or all drawbacks) of half the item’s costs. The effect level can be calculated as a negative spell or at the Judge’s discretion. When drawbacks can be calculated in terms of a spell (the inverse of an AC or saving throw bonus, a negative effect suffered, etc.), the Judge should round the level down — a 13-point negative spell is a 1st level drawback. A drawback that does not actually disadvantage normal users of the item does not give any cost discount (Judge’s discretion). It does not reduce the cost of an item to limit its powers to specific users (such as a specific class or race), as this is as much an advantage as it is a disadvantage.

###### Magic Research Throw Requirements

A magic research throw is required to create a magic item unless the researcher has a formula for the item. The target value of the throw is increased by the level of the spell effect imbued. If multiple effects are being imbued, use the total level of all spell effects (except for charged items, see above). A +1 item bonus is considered a 1st level spell, a +2 item bonus is considered a single 3rd level spell, and a +3 item bonus is considered a single 6th level spell. If the researcher is working from a sample, he gains a +4 bonus to the magic research throw.

###### Other Requirements

**Formulas and Samples:** While not technically “required,” formulas and samples are very useful for magic item creation.

A **formula** is a magical recipe for the creation of an item. A researcher automatically has a formula for any magic item he has previously created. Formulas may also be recovered from ancient ruins, found in esoteric libraries, purchased or stolen from other spellcasters, and so on. When a researcher has a formula for a magic item, the researcher:

* knows the special components required to pay the component cost before he begins the project;
* can enchant that magic item without having to learn or invent the spells imbued in the item; and
* does not have to make a magic research throw to complete the magic item, unless he is experimenting.

A **sample** is simply an existing magic item that is available to the spellcaster while he is working. When a researcher has a sample for a magic item, the researcher:

* can enchant that magic item without having to learn or invent the spells imbued in the item; and
* gains a +4 bonus on his magic research throw to complete the magic item.

**Workshops:** Just as a spellcaster needs a library to research spells, he needs a **workshop** in order to create magic items. Wizards’ guilds and major temples often will provide their mages and crusaders access to a workshop. If a spellcaster wishes to build his own workshop, a minimum of 4,000gp must be invested to allow creation of 1st level spell effects or item bonuses. For each subsequent spell level or bonus, another 2,000gp must be invested.

Having an exceptionally valuable workshop aids item creation. For every 10,000gp of value above the minimum required for the item, the spellcaster gains a +1 bonus on his magic research throw (up to a maximum +3 bonus).

Two or more researchers can share the same workshop. When calculating the bonus from large workshops, divide the total value of the workshop by the number of researchers using it for different projects. However, regardless of the number of researchers, use the total value of the workshop to determine the maximum level of spells that can be researched there.

EXAMPLE: Hearing tales of the legendary **Bow of the Great Eagles**, Rigan wishes to commission a similar weapon, but lacks the funds for such a grand project. Elaria proposes crafting a cheaper alternative: a **composite bow +3** (base cost 35,000gp) that can grant the wielder the Precise Shooting proficiency for 12 turns 3/day (3rd level effect, base cost 18,000gp), with a couple shortcuts in the creation process to cut costs. Rigan soon finds that these shortcuts come with a toll: animals are wary of him while carrying his new bow (1st level permanent drawback: reversed beast friendship proficiency, -25,000gp), and whenever he is shooting more precisely his reaction time is slowed (2nd level 3/day drawback: -1 initiative penalty custom power with 12 turn duration, -12,000gp). The cost of his bow is calculated like so: 35,000gp + 18,000gp = 53,000gp (determine pre-discount cost); 18,000gp – 12,000gp = 9,000gp (apply discounts for any activated effects, with a max discount of 1/2 the cost of each effect); 35,000gp + 9000gp – 25,000gp = 26,500gp final cost (apply discounts for permanent effects, with a max total discount of 1/2 the pre-discount cost). Rigan dubs it the **Bow of the Half-Decent Falcon**, much to Elaria’s annoyance.

### Identifying Magic Items

###### Researcher Requirements

Magic item research can be undertaken by a spellcaster of 5th level or higher to discover the properties and command words associated with a particular magic item.

###### Cost Requirements

**Component Cost:** None

**Material Cost:** 1,000gp.

**Research Cost:** 1,000gp.

###### Magic Research Throw Requirements

A magic research throw is required to discover the properties of a magic item. The target value of the throw is increased by the level of the spells imbued into the item (as above).

###### Other Requirements

**Library:** The researcher must have access to a library (his own or shared, as above) at least equal in value to the cost of the research. For every 10,000gp of value above the minimum required for the research, the researcher receives a +1 bonus on his magic research throw.

**Sample:** The researcher must have a sample, that is, he must be able to study the item he is researching. The sample must be intact and functional, with at least one charge if a charged item.

### Designing Constructs

###### Researcher Requirements

Spellcasters who reach 11th level or higher can design magical **constructs** similar to animated statues, gargoyles, and golems. Because of their proficiency with crafts, dwarven craftpriests can design magical constructs starting at 9th level. The spellcaster is limited to designing constructs with HD no more than twice his class level.

The designer of a construct can reverse-engineer the design from a sample or design from scratch. If designing from scratch, he will determine all of its characteristics, as explained below. The researcher must decide on the characteristics will take before beginning the actual process of design.

**Type:** All constructs are, obviously, constructs! If the designer is also capable of granting unlife (see below), he can design an undead construct. All constructs are enchanted creatures for purposes of spells such as *dispel evil* and *holy circle*.

**Body Form:** Constructs can have any desired body form.

**Movement:** Constructs will have their movement capabilities determined by its body form. Other movement capabilities can be selected as minor or major special abilities, as per the ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual****.*

**Armor Class**: Constructs will have a default Armor Class equal to half their Hit Dice. The construct’s body form or size can further modify its AC. Improvements to AC can be selected as minor or major special abilities as per the ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual****.*

**Immunities:** Because they are not truly alive, constructs are immune to enchantment effects and poisonous damage. These collectively count as one major special ability. Constructs can be given additional resistances or immunities, such as immunity to non-magical weapons, if desired. Additional resistances and immunities count as between 1 minor (#) and 1 major (\*) special ability, as per the ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual***.

**Hit Dice**: Constructs must have a minimum of 1 HD. The spellcaster is limited to designing constructs with HD no more than twice his class level.

**Weight and Size:** Constructs’ weight and size will be determined using their HD and the body mass exponent (BME) as if they were a living creature, according to the rules in the ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual***. Then multiply weight by 2.5 to reflect the sturdy materials used in constructs. (Bronze, iron, and other constructs can be assumed to be partly hollow, or otherwise weight would be 6-20x). Undead constructs weigh 50% as much as living creatures. Halving a construct’s weight counts as two minor special abilities.

**Attacks**: Constructs may have from one to four attacks per round selected from those available to their body form. Their attacks may inflict up to three times their HD in maximum damage per round. This damage may be divided among all their attacks as desired. Any special attacks or powers count as minor or major special abilities, as per the ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual***.

**Morale:** If mindless, morale is not applicable. If of animal or sapient intelligence, constructs have morale scores of +4.

**Special Abilities:** Constructs can have one or more additional minor or major special abilities selected from the list in the ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual****.* The spellcaster must have spells in his repertoire that emulate any desired spell-like or supernatural abilities. For instance, a mage cannot imbue a construct with the power to magically teleport if he doesn’t have *teleportation* in his repertoire.

**Special Disabilities:** Constructs can have major and/or minor special disabilities like those in the ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual***. Special disabilities reduce the cost of constructs as if they were negative special abilities.

**Intellect:** Most constructs are mindless. Constructs can be designed to have animal intelligence at a cost of one major special ability (\*) or sapient intelligence at a cost of two major special abilities (\*\*).

**Alignment:** If mindless, the construct’s alignment is Neutral, or Chaotic if undead. Otherwise the construct’s alignment is the same as that of its designer.

###### Cost Requirements

**Component Cost:** Designing a construct does not require any special components.

**Material Cost:** 2,000gp per Hit Die of the construct, plus an additional 625gp per minor special ability and 5,000gp per major special ability.

**Research Cost:** 2,000gp per Hit Die of the construct, plus an additional 625gp per minor special ability and 5,000gp per major special ability.

###### Magic Research Throw Requirements

A magic research throw is required to design a construct. The target value for this throw is increased by +1 for every 5,000gp the construct costs. If the throw is successful, the researcher gains a formula that can be used to manufacture the construct. If the researcher is reverse-engineering from a sample, he gains a +4 bonus to the magic research throw.

###### Other Requirements

**Library:** To design a construct, the researcher must have access to a library (his own or shared, as above) at least equal in value to the cost of the construct throughout the design process. For every 10,000gp of value above the minimum required for the construct, the spellcaster receives a +1 bonus on his magic research throw (up to a maximum +3 bonus).

**Sample:** A sample is required to reverse engineer the design of an existing construct. A sample need not be intact or functional — the remains of a construct destroyed in battle can serve as a sample. A sample is not required to design a construct from scratch.

### Manufacturing Constructs

###### Researcher Requirements

Spellcasters who reach 11th level or higher can manufacture magical **constructs** similar to animated statues, gargoyles, and golems. Because of their proficiency with crafts, dwarven craftpriests can manufacture magical constructs starting at 9th level. The spellcaster is limited to manufacturing constructs with HD no more than twice his class level.

###### Cost Requirements

**Component Cost:** Manufacturing a construct does not require any special components in most cases. However, if the construct being manufactured is undead, the manufacturer must supply one or more dead bodies with the same body form as the construct and a total weight equal to or greater than the construct’s weight.

**Material Cost:** 2,000gp per Hit Die of the construct, plus an additional 625gp per minor special ability and 5,000gp per major special ability.

**Research Cost:** 2,000gp per Hit Die of the construct, plus an additional 625gp per minor special ability and 5,000gp per major special ability.

###### Magic Research Throw Requirements

A magic research throw is required to manufacture a construct. The target value for this throw is increased by +1 for every 5,000gp the construct costs. If the throw is successful, the researcher successfully manufactures the construct.

A mindless construct is automatically under the control of its manufacturer. Otherwise, the Judge should make a reaction roll to determine the construct’s reaction to the caster. If the construct is unfriendly or hostile, the researcher could try to control it using spells, or imprison it in his dungeon, or simply unleash it onto the world.

###### Other Requirements

**Formula or Sample:** The researcher must have a manufacturing formula for the construct he wishes to create. Formula can be found as treasure in rare manuals, or designed by the research (see above). A sample is insufficient, though it can be used to reverse engineer the formula (see above).

**Workshop:** To manufacture a construct, the researcher must have access to a workshop (his own or shared, as above) at least equal in value to the cost of the construct throughout the manufacturing process. (If the construct is undead, the manufacturer must have a **mortuary and embalming chamber** instead, as described below). For every 10,000gp of value above the minimum required for the construct, the spellcaster receives a +1 bonus on his magic research throw.

EXAMPLE: Quintus, an 11th level mage with 16 INT, is designing a golem from scratch. Therefore he gets to determine all of its characteristics freely. He chooses to design a humanoid construct with 10 HD. He assigns it a BME of 1.88, giving it a weight of 5,754 lbs; this is then multiplied by 2.5 to reflect construct materials, for a final weight of 14,385 lbs. As a humanoid, it has a speed of 120’. At 10 HD, it has a default AC of 5. He wants it to be immune to acid (##), cold (##), fire (##), and lightning (##) in addition to its standard construct immunities to poison and enchantment effects (\*). Since eight minor abilities (#) counts as one major special ability (\*), the construct has a total of two major special abilities (\*\*). The construct can inflict a maximum of 30 damage per round, and Quintus decides to give it one slam attack dealing 3d10 bludgeoning damage.

This gives the construct a materials cost and research cost of (2,000gp x 10) + (5,000 x 2) = 30,000gp. As an 11th level mage, Quintus has a research rate of 1,750gp per day, so it will take him about 18 days to complete the design. He is working from a library with a value of 40,000gp. The magic research throw value to design the construct is 12+ (base 6+ plus 30,000/5,000) but Quintus gets a bonus of +2 for his INT bonus and +1 for the library quality [(40,000-30,000)/(10,000)]. Quintus will therefore need to throw 9+ to succeed. He rolls a 14 and succeeds. He names his new design a granite golem.

Now that he has the formula for the granite golem, Quintus can manufacture it. The construct’s manufacture will cost him another 30,000gp in materials and research. As an 11th level mage, Quintus has a research rate of 1,750gp per day, so it will take him about 18 days to complete the construct. He will need a workshop of at least 30,000gp in order to manufacture the golem and will need to succeed on another magic research throw of 12+, modified by his INT and any bonus from his workshop quality.

### Crossbreeds

###### Researcher Requirements

Arcane and eldritch spellcasters who reach 11th level or higher may create **crossbreeds** by magically blending different progenitor creatures together.

The progenitor creatures must not have HD greater than the arcane spellcaster’s class level, and cannot have more than one major special ability (\*) plus one major special ability per point of the spellcaster’s attribute bonus from Intellect. Eight minor special abilities (#) count as one major special ability.

EXAMPLE: Quintus, an 11th level mage with 16 INT, can crossbreed from 11 HD progenitors each with 3 major special abilities or 24 minor special abilities or any equivalent combination thereof.

The creator of a magical crossbreed will imbue it with various features and abilities drawn from their progenitors, as explained below. The researcher must decide on the form his crossbreed will take before beginning the actual process of creating the crossbreed.

**Type:** Crossbreeds are usually monstrosities. However, they might also or instead be animals, beastmen, giant humanoids, humanoids, incarnations, oozes, or vermin, depending on their progenitors and their characteristics (Judge’s discretion).

**Body Form:** The crossbreed can have the body form of either progenitor or a hybrid body form.

**Movement:** The crossbreed will have the movement capabilities of whichever progenitor’s body form it took. If it has a hybrid body form, it can have the movement capabilities of either or both progenitors. If it has the movement of both, this counts as a major special ability.

**Armor Class**: The crossbreed will have the AC of the progenitor from which it was assigned its movement capabilities. If it has the movement of both, it will have whichever AC is better.

**Hit Dice**: The researcher can assign his crossbreed the HD of either progenitor, or any amount in between.

**Weight and Size:** The crossbreed’s weight and size will be determined using its HD and the body mass exponent (BME) of its body form according to the rules in the ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual***. If it has a hybrid body form, it can have the BME of either progenitor, or any amount in between.

**Attacks**: The crossbreed will have the attacks of whichever progenitor’s body form it took. If it has a hybrid body form, it can be assigned the attacks of either or both progenitors. If it has the attacks of both, this counts as a major special ability. If the crossbreed is of greater HD than the progenitor from which it draws its attacks, the damage inflicted by the attacks will be scaled up proportionate to the increase in Hit Dice.

**Morale:** A crossbreed can be assigned the morale of either progenitor, or any amount in between.

**Special Abilities:** A crossbreed can have the major and/or minor special abilities of one, both, or none of its progenitors. Since the number of special abilities permitted is capped, and each special ability makes the crossbreed more expensive and difficult to create, the researcher may opt to drop some or all special abilities of either or both progenitors.

**Special Disabilities:** A crossbreed can have the major and/or minor special disabilities of one, both, or none of its progenitors. Special disabilities reduce the cost of the crossbreed as if they were negative special abilities.

**Special Senses:** A crossbreed can have the visual senses and other senses of one, both, or none of its progenitors, paying for them as special abilities. Any crossbreed can be given lightless vision (60’) at a cost of two minor abilities regardless of progenitors.

**Intellect:** The crossbreed might be of mindless, animal, semi-sapient, or sapient intelligence depending on its progenitors. If both progenitors are mindless, the crossbreed must be mindless. If either progenitor is of animal intelligence, the progenitor can be of animal intelligence. If both are of animal intelligence, the progenitor must be of animal intelligence. If either progenitor is sapient, the crossbreed can be sapient. If both are sapient, the progenitor must be, too. The researcher can decide to preserve the memory and personality of one of the progenitors, if desired.

**Alignment:** If either progenitor is Chaotic, the crossbreed will be Chaotic. If both progenitors are Lawful, the crossbreed will be Lawful. Otherwise the crossbreed will be Neutral.

**Other Characteristics:** Whatever their type, crossbreeds heal naturally, and can reproduce with others of their breed. If they still closely resemble one of their progenitors, they can breed with them as well. It has a lifespan and reproductive cycle mid-way between its progenitors. If the caster wishes the crossbreed to have the lifespan and reproductive cycle of just one progenitor, this counts as a special ability.

A magical crossbreed is not automatically under the control of the caster. If the researcher preserved the memory and personality of a progenitor, the magical crossbreed will have the same relationship with the caster as the progenitor did. Otherwise, the Judge should make a reaction roll to determine the crossbreed’s reaction to the caster. If the crossbreed is unfriendly or hostile, the caster could try to tame, train, or **bewitch** it using specialists or spells; imprison it in his dungeon; or just unleash it onto the world.

###### Cost Requirements

**Component Cost:** Creating a crossbreed does not require any special components beyond the progenitor creatures themselves (which are irrevocably killed in the process). A researcher can use himself as a progenitor if desired.

**Material Cost:** 2,000gp per Hit Die of the crossbreed, plus an additional 625gp per minor special ability and 5,000gp per major special ability.

**Research Cost:** 2,000gp per Hit Die of the crossbreed, plus an additional 625gp per minor special ability and 5,000gp per major special ability.

###### Magic Research Throw Requirements

A magic research throw is required to create a crossbreed. The target value for this throw is increased by +1 for every 5,000gp the crossbreeding costs. The success or failure of the crossbreeding will not be known until the progenitors are killed in the attempt.

###### Other Requirements

**Crossbreeding Laboratory:** The spellcaster must have access to a special **crossbreeding laboratory** at least equal in value to the cost of the crossbreed. For every 10,000gp of value above the minimum required for the crossbreed, the spellcaster receives a +1 bonus on his magic research throw.

### Performing Necromancy

###### Researcher Requirements

Chaotic spellcasters who reach 11th level or higher may transform a recently-deceased subject into an intelligent undead monster through the black arts of necromancy.

The subject must be dead when the project is completed, but it can only have been dead for 1 day per HD, so it is often best if preparations are begun before the subject dies or is killed. A spellcaster may transform himself into an intelligent undead using necromancy if desired, by killing himself or having himself killed at the conclusion of the project.

The new undead’s form must not have HD greater than the caster level. In addition, if the subject is transformed into corporeal undead, its undead body must remain in approximately the same form and size as it possessed in life. Subject to these limitations, the researcher can transform the creature into any type of undead with which he is familiar. New types of undead with previously unseen powers can be created only via experimentation.

EXAMPLE: Quintus, an 11th level mage with 16 INT, can transform creatures into undead with up to 11 HD with 3 special abilities each.

An undead monster created through necromancy is not automatically under the control of the caster. If the subject creature was a willing participant in the necromancy, it will retain its friendly relationship with the caster when it becomes undead. Otherwise, the Judge should make a reaction roll to determine the undead’s reaction to the caster. If the undead monster is unfriendly or hostile, the caster could try to control it using spells, or imprison it in his dungeon, or simply unleash it onto the world.

###### Cost Requirements

**Component Cost:** Transforming a creature into an undead monster requires special components, usually (as if with magic items) organs or blood from one or more monsters with a total XP value equal to the cost of the research. If the undead has special abilities the creature providing the components must have at least as many special abilities. The Judge will determine the specific components based on the necromancy involved. If the undead has particular needs (a phylactery, coffin, etc.) these must also be provided. If the researcher doesn’t know the components at the outset of the necromancy, he learns them when 50% of the labor cost has been paid.

**Material Cost:** 2,000gp per Hit Die of the undead, plus an additional 625gp per minor special ability and 5,000gp per major special ability.

**Research Cost:** 2,000gp per Hit Die of the undead, plus an additional 625gp per minor special ability and 5,000gp per major special ability.

###### Magic Research Throw Requirements

A magic research throw is required to grant unlife. If the creature is willing, the target value for this throw is increased by +1 for every 5,000gp of necromancy costs. If the creature is unwilling, the target value for the throw is increased by +2 for every 5,000gp. The success or failure of the necromancy will not be known until the creature is dead.

###### Other Requirements

**Mortuary and Embalming Chamber:** To perform necromancy, the researcher must have access to a private **mortuary and embalming chamber** at least equal in value to the cost of the necromancy. For every 10,000gp of value above the minimum required for the necromancy, the spellcaster receives a +1 bonus on his magic research throw. By using precious materials, the spellcaster can gain a bonus on his magic research throw, as described above.

### Learning Ritual Spells

###### Researcher Requirements

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Caster Level** | **Ritual Spell Repertoire** |
| 11 | 1 + key attribute modifier |
| 12 | 2 + key attribute modifier |
| 13 | 3 + key attribute modifier |
| 14 | 4 + key attribute modifier |

Ritual spells are very powerful dweomers of 7th, 8th, or 9th spell level. Only spellcasters of 11th level or higher can learn ritual spells. Each ritual spell must be learned separately through research. When a researcher learns a ritual spell, he gains a copy of its formula (if he does not have it already) and adds it to his repertoire. A researcher can have any number of ritual spell formulas, but he can only keep a small number of ritual spells of each level in his repertoire, as shown on the Ritual Spell Repertoire table.

EXAMPLE: Quintus, an 11th level mage with 16 Intellect, could learn 3 arcane ritual spells of each level. Balbus, a 14th level crusader with 14 Will, could learn 5 divine ritual spells of each level.

###### Cost Requirements

**Component Cost:** None

**Material Cost:** 50,000gp for 7th level; 100,000gp for 8th level; 200,000gp for 9th level

**Research Cost:** 50,000gp for 7th level; 100,000gp for 8th level; 200,000gp for 9th level

###### Magic Research Throw Requirements

A magic research throw is required to learn a ritual spell unless the researcher has a formula for the ritual. The target value of the throw is increased by the level of the ritual spell.

###### Other Requirements

**Library:** The researcher must have access to a library (his own or shared, as above). The minimum library value is 16,000gp for 7th level spells; 18,000gp for 8th level spells; and 20,000gp for 9th level spells. For every 10,000gp of value above the minimum required for the spell, the spellcaster receives a +1 bonus on his magic research throw (up to a maximum +3 bonus).

**Formula:** If a researcher has the formula for a ritual spell, he can learn it without making a magic research throw. He still must pay the material cost and research cost.

### Casting Ritual Spells

###### Researcher Requirements

Spellcasters of 11th level or higher can cast ritual spells from their repertoire of rituals they have learned.

###### Cost Requirements

**Component Cost:** 50,000gp for 7th level; 100,000gp for 8th level; 200,000gp for 9th level. The special components required to cast the ritual will be known from the ritual spell’s formula. Usually the component cost for ritual spells must be paid with various monster parts from one or more monsters with a total XP value equal to the gp cost of the research. Some ritual spells have even more esoteric requirements. Ritual spells can never use miscellaneous components.

**Material Cost:** 50,000gp for 7th level; 100,000gp for 8th level; 200,000gp for 9th level

**Research Cost:** 50,000gp for 7th level; 100,000gp for 8th level; 200,000gp for 9th level

###### Magic Research Throw Requirements

A magic research throw is required to cast a ritual spell. The target value of the throw is increased by the level of the ritual spell. When a ritual spell is successfully cast, the spellcaster can choose to have the ritual take effect immediately, or he can store the spell effect on a scroll or as a charge in a ring (like a **ring of wishes**), rod, staff, or wand. Storing the spell effect does not have an additional cost — the act of casting a ritual spell is identical to that of creating a single charge of a magic item with the spell effect. Ritual spells can never be enchanted as activated, at-will, or permanent magic items.

###### Other Requirements

**Workshop:** The researcher must have access to a **workshop**. The minimum workshop value is 16,000gp for 7th level spells; 18,000gp for 8th level spells; and 20,000gp for 9th level spells. For every 10,000gp of value above the minimum required for the spell, the spellcaster receives a +1 bonus on his magic research throw (up to a maximum +3 bonus).

### Sample Ritual Spells

A short list of ritual spells is provided below. The Judge can make available additional rituals spells from a variety of other compatible fantasy games or develop a list of ritual spells unique to his campaign using the rules in ***ACKS II Judges Journal****.*

###### Apotheosis

Arcane 9, Divine 9 Type: ritual, transmogrification

Range: touch Duration: instantaneous

The Empyrean faiths teach that after death, the body must be burned so that Calefa can swiftly usher the soul to the afterlife, where its valor is weighed by Türas. Base and sordid souls drink of the waters of sorrow and return again to the realms of man in a new body. Noble, heroic souls pass to the Empyrean Heaven as Exalted beings, to dwell in the glory of the halls of Ammonar. The Chthonic cults teach that this is a lie, and that the souls of the dead are dissolved into chaos upon death. Only by achieving undeath can the individual soul survive until the Awakening incarnates all the faithful.

Esoteric practitioners of both faiths admit to the possibility of a third path, one that transcends death and undeath, and bypasses the judgment of the Empyrean gods and the slumber of the Chthonic ones. The ritual of *apotheosis* allows a living or undead creature to transfigure into an immortal without ever dying.

When the ritual is complete, the recipient of the spell (who can be the caster or another of the same alignment) must make a Death saving throw. If the recipient is a Zaharan or other race with the Dark Souls racial weakness, he suffers a -1 penalty on the save per class level unless he has first transformed himself unto undead. If the recipient’s saving throws are improved by magic items or spells, those bonuses do not apply, but saving throw bonuses from class powers, proficiencies, and racial powers do apply.

If the saving throw fails, the recipient’s soul proves too weak to achieve immortality. His very existence is obliterated forever, with not even ritual magic able to restore him to life.

If the saving throw succeeds, the subject is transformed into a divine being. Update the recipient’s characteristics as noted:

* The recipient’s monster type becomes **incarnation**. As an incarnation, he gains an indefinite lifespan and no longer needs to consume food or water to survive. He can no longer be affected by spells or effects that only target living creatures.
* The recipient retains all of his attributes and preserves his sex. He mostly maintains his physical appearance, but it is always transformed in some way based on his alignment, faith, powers, and deeds. The Judge determines the final appearance.
* The recipient is healed of any existing permanent wounds or side effects of tampering with mortality.
* The recipient retains all of his earned XP, class powers, and racial abilities. He advances thereafter following the rules for transformed characters in the ***ACKS II Judges Journal***.
* The recipient’s Hit Die is increased to d8 per level of experience. If the recipient already had d6 Hit Dice, he gains a permanent +2 bonus to AC as well. If the recipient already had d8 Hit Dice, he gains a permanent +4 bonus to AC. If the recipient has a higher HD, it remains unaltered and the recipient gains a permanent +4 bonus to AC.
* The recipient’s attack throw progression is increased to the monster progression. If the recipient already had crusader or thief progression, he gains a +2 bonus to damage from attacks. If the recipient already had fighter progression, he gains a +4 bonus to damage from attacks. The damage bonus does not apply to spells.
* The recipient gains lightless vision (90’) and permanent *telepathy* (as the spell).
* The recipient becomes aligned with another sphere of existence – either the sphere of empyrean heaven, the sphere of chthonic darkness, or one of the four elemental spheres. The sphere is determined by the Judge based on the character’s alignment, faith, powers, and deeds. He can *teleport* without error as a movement action to and from his aligned sphere, arriving at whatever location on the sphere is geo-spiritually “analogous” to the location from which he departed.
* The recipient becomes immune to mundane damage and poison damage. He also becomes immune to one other type of damage, depending on which sphere he aligns himself with: empyrean heaven – luminous; chthonic darkness – necrotic; elemental air – electric; elemental earth – seismic; elemental fire – fire; elemental water – cold.
* The recipient can become **incorporeal** at will as a movement action. When the recipient becomes incorporeal, all his worn and carried objects also become incorporeal. He can, but does not have to, become **invisible**and **inaudible**while incorporeal. While incorporeal, the recipient can *scry* (as the spell) any shrine or temple dedicated to his worship, and *teleport* there without error by expending a movement action.
* The recipient’s immortal existence must hereafter be sustained by worship. Calculate the recipient’s XP value as if he were a monster with \*\*\*\*\* (5 special abilities). Each day, he must consume arcane power or divine power equal to 6% of his XP value. If he fails to consume enough power, his HD drop by 1. He can re-gain lost HD by catching up on missing power. If reduced to 0 HD, he is forced into a deathless incorporeal torpor until his worship resumes – which may be never.
* The recipient can hereafter absorb arcane power and divine power from worship and can expend this power directly to cast spells, grant spells to divine casters who worship him, undertake magic research, or simply sustain his existence. He can also consume divine power to increase his vitality, gaining 1 campaign XP per gp value of divine power. Appendix C: Cosmology in the ***ACKS Judges Journal***provides the costs of spells cast with arcane and divine power.

The component cost for this spell can only be paid with arcane power, divine power, or special components extracted from incarnations. If divine power is used, the deity which granted the divine power must consent to the ritual, and will expect the newly-ascended immortal to serve as an angel, demon, or demigod in his service.

###### Cataclysm

Divine 9 Type: blast, ritual

Range: special Duration: 1 day

This ritual unleashes the full wrath of the caster’s god. The nature of the *cataclysm*will depend on the deity the spellcaster serves: Ammonar, Lord of the Dawn, favors a meteor from the heavens; Telith, the Earth Mother, often sends earthquakes, and Dirgion, the Doom Lord, prefers a rain of hellfire. Regardless of its form, a *cataclysm*will affect one domain with an area of up to 16 6-mile hexes (or 1 24-mile hex). It will affect both the domain and any urban settlement within the domain, but each should be treated separately.

A *cataclysm* has unlimited range, but the caster must have either visited the target domain, or personally met the ruler of the target domain. *Cataclysm* cannot be cast against the domain of a ruler of the same alignment in good standing with the caster’s religion; it is usually reserved for punishing terrible heresies or destroying foes during holy wars. A *cataclysm*’s component cost can only be paid for with divine power (p. XX).

Once the *cataclysm*ritual is begun, ominous signs and portents (swelling tides, falling stars, rippling fault-lines, etc.) will warn the inhabitants of the target domain of their imminent doom. The signs and portents will increase in frequency as the ritual nears completion. (If the *cataclysm* has been crafted into a magic item such that it can be cast immediately, then the *cataclysm* takes place one week after it is cast, with daily portents of increasing gravity.)

A *miracle*or *wish*, if available, can be used during this time period to avert the *cataclysm*. The death of the ritual’s caster will also avert the *cataclysm*. Left unchecked, the actual *cataclysm* will occur when the ritual is completed. A *cataclysm* cannot be **dispelled**.

If it is allowed to occur, the *cataclysm*devastates the target domain. The extent of damage caused by the *cataclysm* will depend on the population density of the affected domain. For every 1,000 families in a domain, each stronghold and each urban settlement will lose 3d6 x 1000gp in value, and 1d10 x 100 families will be slain. (Where the number of dice is quite large, the Judge can simply use the average values or use an online die rolling tool). If the remaining stronghold value or urban investment value in the hex is too low to sustain the domain’s population, it will immediately lose any excess population as the population scatters. A domain subject to a *cataclysm*must also make an immediate domain morale roll with a -4 penalty.

EXAMPLE: Mentu the Death-Priest, theocrat of Dirgion, unleashes a *cataclysm* on the domain of Aura itself. A band of heroes fails to stop him in time, and the *cataclysm*occurs as rains of hellfire plummets downward. Aura has a population of 12,500 plus an urban settlement with 100,000 families. Its stronghold value is 720,000gp and its urban investment is 2,500,000gp. The *cataclysm* causes the loss of (12,500 / 1000 x 1d10 x 100) 12d10 x 100 peasant families and (100,000 / 1000 x 1d10 x 100) 100d10 x 100 urban families. The dice result in the loss of 5,700 peasant families and 54,400 urban families. The *cataclysm*also causes the loss of (12,500 / 1000 x 3d6 x 1000gp) 36d6 x 1000gp in stronghold value and (100,000 / 1000 x 3d6 x 1000gp) 300d6 x 1000gp in urban investment. The dice result in the loss of 132,000gp in stronghold value and 1,085,000gp in urban investment.

###### Consonant Transit

Arcane 8, Divine 8 Type: movement, ritual

Range: touch Duration: special

This ritual allows the caster to harmonize the hyperdimensional orbit of the celestial sphere of Cybele with that of another sphere of existence within the Cosmos, allowing two-way transit between the two: one instant of transit to the target sphere, and one later instant to travel back.

The material cost for *consonant transit* must be expended in the creation of a transit frame, which resembles a cube circumscribed by ethereal figments. The specific composition of the frame is dictated by the destination sphere. The cost of the frame is determined by its size, quality, and intended destination. The frame can transit one passenger per 25 square feet. The minimum cost is 100,000gp (the material cost for this ritual.)

|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Frame Quality | Elemental Sphere (any) | Celestial Sphere (any) | Chthonic Darkness | Empyrean Heaven |
| Low | 500gp per 25sf | 1000gp per 25sf | 2,500gp per 25sf | 50,000gp per 25sf |
| Medium | 5,000gp per 25sf | 10,000gp per 25sf | 25,000gp per 25sf | 500,000gp per 25sf |
| High | 25,000gp per 25sf | 50,000gp per 25sf | 125,000gp per 25sf | 2,500,000gp per 25sf |

EXAMPLE: Tirenius wishes to create a transit frame that will be able to convey himself and his three companions into the Sphere of Chthonic Darkness. He sees that he can create a 100sf medium-quality frame for 100,000gp, which meets the material cost of the ritual.

When the ritual is complete, the caster designates a sapient recipient by touch to guide the transition. The caster can designate himself as the recipient if desired. The recipient is responsible for paying the component cost of the ritual, a responsibility which presents him with a terrible dilemma: *consonant transit’*s entire component cost can be paid off if the recipient willingly sacrifices his own child by blood. (Recipients transiting to the Chthonic Darkness can sacrifice themselves instead of their child.) The sacrificed victim’s soul is then used to briefly bind the spheres, after which its residue dissipates into the interstices of the Cosmos and is lost even to the gods. If a familial blood sacrifice is not acceptable (or available), the component cost can be paid with arcane power, divine power, fragments of the Tablet of Destiny, and other sources.

One the sacrifice or expenditure is made, the transit takes place. The recipient will transit to the new sphere, along with whichever willing creatures within the frame he desires to bring. All carried and worn equipment is brought along in transit. Creatures who choose not to come (or who the recipient chooses not to bring) remain behind with their belongings.

At the moment of transit, the recipient has some control over the point of arrival. The amount of control is determined by the quality of the frame. A high-quality frame allows the recipient to select any unwarded destination on the target sphere. A medium-quality frame allows the recipient to select one of several possible destination offered by the Judge (e.g., in a dense fog in a forest, in a cavern below ground). A low-qualify frame offers no choice; the Judge selects the destination. Regardless of frame quality, the selected destination must be devoid of living creatures.

After transit, the frame will appear at the destination, but its appearance, form, and nature might be transformed by the transit to the new sphere. For instance, transit to the sphere of Chthonic Darkness might cause the frame to appear as a blood-stained altar while transit to the Empyrean Heaven might cause the frame to appear as incorporeal lines of light.

The recipient also has some control over the amount of time before the return occurs, also determined by the quality of the transit frame. A high-quality frame allows the recipient to determine the precise moment of return, and trigger it at will at an earlier time. A medium-quality frame allows the recipient to select the day of return, but the exact moment during the day will be random. A low-quality frame offers no choice; the return will happen at some point during the next 1d100 years. Fortunately, the recipient knows precisely when return will occur, even if he did not precisely select the moment.

Any creature, within the frame, willing or not, at the instant of return will transit back to the originating sphere to the location of initial departure.

A *consonant travel* ritual cannot be **dispelled**. However, a *wish* or *miracle* could be used to end the ritual and either immediately return or prevent the return of the travelers.

###### Consume Power

Arcane 8 , Divine 8 Type: protection, ritual, transmogrification

Range: special Duration: instantaneous

This ritual can only be cast in a place of power such as a an aerie of elemental air, pinnacle of good, etc. When it is complete, the ritual permanently drains the ambient power from the entire place and diverts it into the caster. The effect that the caster experiences from consuming these magical energies depends on the type and power of the place.

On the table below, roll 1d4 for a minor place of power; roll 1d4 then 1d8 for a major place of power; and roll 1d4, 1d8, and then 1d12 for a supreme place of power. (From time to time a particularly bold or desperate spellcaster has cast *consume power* while visiting another sphere of existence, such as the empyrean heaven or elemental sphere of fire. In such cases, the caster rolls 1d8, 1d12, and 1d12+4.) Apply the effects in the order rolled. All effects, good and ill, are cumulative, permanent, and irreversible save by ritual magic.

|  |  |  |  |

###### Harvest\*

Divine 7 Type: healing, ritual, transmogrification

Range: 12 milesDuration: 12 months

This ritual enables the caster to channel divine energy into the land around him, blessing it with fertile soil and bountiful harvests. *Harvest* increases the land value of all territory within 12 miles (1 24-mile hex or 500 square miles) by 2gp per peasant family for the next 12 months. See Collecting Revenue in the **Domains and Realms** section for details on land value.

*Ravage*, the reverse of *harvest*, decreases the land value of all territory within 12 miles by 2gp per peasant family for the next 12 months. *Ravage* can be undone by a successful *remove curse* cast by a spellcaster of greater level than the caster or by a *harvest* spell.

###### Emissary

Arcane 8 Type: ritual, summoning

Range: special Duration: special

This ritual reaches across the infinite horizons of the Cosmos to summon an emissary from another sphere of existence. The connection across the spheres can only be made at a major or supreme place of power, and the summoned emissary will always appear in a random location within the place. The ritual usually, but not always, selects an emissary that was about to die in his home sphere.

The emissary will be a 9th level character with exceptional attributes generated by rolling 5d6 for each and keeping the best 3d6. (Some can have guaranteed attributes.) The emissary can progress rapidly in power, automatically gaining a +50% bonus on any earned XP. The Judge can choose the race, class, origin, equipment, and powers of the emissary or roll 1d10 on the table below.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Die Roll | Race and Class |
| 1 | A **Mage** with strange golden skin and slitted pupils in red robes arrives by arcane portal. He has INT 18 but suffers from the Heart and Lung Damage permanent wound. |
| 2 | An **Elven Nightblade** with a 7HD panther henchman step out of the shadows. The nightblade has Beast Friendship and Fighting Style Specialization (Dual Weapons). Unlike most elves, he has black skin and white hair. |
| 3 | A **Paladin** wanders in from the mist. He is wearing a surcoat emblazoned with a dragon and carrying a *vorpal sword.* He claims he found the sword inside a rock or in a lake; the story isn’t consistent. He has CHA 18, Command, and Leadership. |
| 4 | A **Thief** with golden teeth and seafarer’s clothes splashes down. He is a master mariner (3 ranks of Seafaring) who carries a slender short sword and a brace of wheellock pistols with smoke-powder. See *Guns of War* p. XX. |
| 5 | A **Fighter** stumbles forward, bleeding from his heel but otherwise unharmed. He wears archaic Nicean plate armor and carries a spear, shield, and short sword. He is protected by *permanent deflect ordinary weapons*. |
| 6 | A **Zaharan Ruinguard** with pale skin and colorless eyes manifests out of a chaotic portal. His CON is capped at 7 but he carries a two-handed sword +3 that grants him *necromantic potence, ogre strength, striking*,and *swift sword* as permanent effects. Any creatures slain by the sword cannot be raised from the dead. If the Ruinguard is slain, the sword laughs and vanishes. |
| 7 | A **Terran Cosmonaut** emerges from a wrecked space capsule bearing a strange red, white, and blue insignia. His space capsule is filled with mysterious techno-artifacts. See *Barbarian Conquerors of Kanahu* p. XX. |
| 8 | A **Terran Starman** appears in a wrecked escape pod labeled NCC-17…. Roll 1d4 for branch: 1 – Command, 2 – Engineering, 3 – Medical, 4 – Science. His escape pod is filled with strange techno-tools. See *BCK*, p. XX. |
| 9 | A **Nephil**, gray-skinned and bug-eyed, enters through a strange iris-like portal. It carries weird alien artifacts; roll for 1d2 weapons and 1d4 devices on Visitor Horde tables. See *BCK*, p. XX. |
| 10 | An **Orc Shaman** of caster level 14 arrives through a dark portal of burning green flame. He keeps querying where the rest of the Horde has gone. See *Axioms Issue 2,* p. XX. |

Having been summoned without warning to another sphere of existence, the emissary is often quite confused as to where or when he is. However, the ritual guarantees that the emissary will be favorably disposed towards the caster, at least initially. The emissary counts as **bewitched**(as the spell *bewitch* *humanoid* spell) until he succeeds on a saving throw to shake off the effect. The emissary will inexplicably be able to speak the primary language of the caster, although from the emissary’s perspective the caster speaks *his* language.

An emissarycan only be **dispelled** by the original caster or by another caster of higher level. If the effect is dispelled, the *emissary* is immediately returned to his sphere of existence. Some emissaries may actively seek to have the effect dispelled while others might wish to avoid it (Judge’s discretion).

###### Flying Fortress

Arcane 9 Type: movement, ritual

Range: touch Duration: permanent

This ritual imbues a target structure or vessel worth up to 75,000gp with the power of flight. As soon as the ritual is cast, the newly-enchanted *flying fortress* ascends at a rate of 20’ per round until it reaches an altitude of 100’ above the ground. Thereafter, the *flying fortress* can be piloted through the air with a combat speed of 20’ per round, an encounter speed of 60’ per turn, and an expedition speed of 24 miles per day, moving in any direction with a maximum elevation of 30,000’ above sea level and a minimum elevation of 100’ above the ground.

The *flying fortress* is piloted from its seat of power. The seat of power can be a cathedra, chair, recliner, throne, stool, or any other piece of furniture affixed to the *flying fortress* and large enough to seat a man-sized creature. The seat of power is decided by the caster when the ritual is cast. The seat of power is not necessarily ornate, but it is usually designed to be as comfortable and sturdy as possible. Piloting the *flying fortress* from the seat of power is a strenuous activity which requires stationary concentration by a sapient creature of at least 9 HD. (Note that if enough high-level pilots are available, the seat of power can be occupied for 24 hours per day, enabling up to 72 miles of travel.) If the seat of power is unoccupied or destroyed, the *flying fortress* remains stationary if at an elevation of 1,000’ or less; otherwise it drifts in the direction of the prevailing wind. A destroyed seat of power can be repaired by an 11th level or higher caster as a magic research project with a 5,000gp component, material, and research cost.

From time to time, the occupants of a *flying fortress* have been known to attempt to drop or fling ballista, catapult or trebuchet stones onto points on the surface. If the target point is within the ordinary range for a war machine (usually 600’ – 1,500’), resolve such attacks as missile attacks with artillery (p. XX) against the target point’s AC. Beyond that range, treat the attack as if it were a missile attack with artillery that scattered. Roll 1d12 to determine the direction to a new impact point, applied as a clock direction from the original impact point (such that 6’o’clock points towards the *flying fortress*). The new impact point is 3d6 feet away per 250’ of range.

EXAMPLE: The occupants of a *flying fortress* drop a 180 lbs trebuchet stone onto the throne room of the imperial palace at Aura. The target point is 10,000’ directly below the *flying fortress*. Because 10,000’ exceeds the range of a heavy trebuchet, the stone automatically scatters by 3d6 x 40’ in a random clock direction. Tragically it lands in the public baths, killing hundreds…

A *flying fortress* cannot be **dispelled,** even by *wish* or *miracle*,as long as its seat of power is intact. However, if the seat of power is destroyed, the *flying fortress* can be dispelled by the original caster or another caster of higher level than the original caster. If the ritual is dispelled, the *flying fortress* crashes to the ground immediately. The structure or vessel takes 1 shp per 10’ fallen, while all creatures in the structure or vessel suffer 20d6 bludgeoning damage, or half that on a successful Blast save.

###### Magic Mushrooms

Divine 7 Type: ritual, transmogrification

Range: 12 milesDuration: 12 months

This ritual magically mutates all of the mushroom farms within 12 miles (1 24-mile hex or 500 square miles). The caster can choose to apply one vagary of mycocultural mutation to the domain or domains within range. The domain ruler cannot stop the vagary from affecting his mushroom crops, but he can avoid the effects by halting further farming until the duration expires. If this occurs, the land revenue of every piltgarin family drops to 0 until the end of the duration. See ***By This Axe***p. XX – XX for details on the vagaries of mycocultural mutation.

The *magic mushrooms* ritual can be **dispelled** by either the caster or a higher-level spellcaster. If not dispelled, the effects of the ritual last for 12 months.

###### Miracle

Divine 9 Type: ritual

Range: unlimited Duration: see below

*Miracle* is the most potent dweomer that any divine caster can perform. Like its arcane counterpart, *wish*, it can accomplish effects beyond the reach of ordinary magic. Some examples of what a *miracle* can accomplish include:

* Create a blast of fire, cloud of poison, or other effect that deals 1d6 extraordinary damage to up to 960 creatures in a 25,000 square foot area of effect with no saving throw — enough to destroy 8 companies, 2 battalions, or 1/2 brigade of ordinary troops.
* Instantaneously create magical construct(s) or magic item(s) with a total base cost of up to 200,000gp.
* Crossbreed any two creatures in line of sight. Unwilling creatures can make a Spells saving throw to resist the effect.
* Destroy a magic item worth up to 200,000gp base cost that was created by or is aligned with the god’s enemies.
* **Dispel** any other spell, heal any disease, or remove any curse, by any source.
* Eliminate any and all existing side effects from tampering with mortality in one creature.
* Instantaneously end another ritual spell. Any ritual spell can be ended except where otherwise noted in its entry.
* Instantaneously grant a class proficiency or class power to a named creature, at the cost of also giving it a side effect from the Tampering with Mortality table.
* Heal up to 1,920 creatures in line of sight of 1d6 damage.
* Instantaneously raise one of a named creature’s ability scores to 18, at the cost of it suffering a side effect from Tampering with Mortality table.
* Restore 60 slain creatures to life as if by *restore life and limb*.
* Slay a named creature or creature in line of sight. The creature can make a Death saving throw to resist the effect.
* Instantaneously transfer up to 600,000gp of precious metals, jewelry, merchandise, and/or livestock to the caster’s possession. The caster cannot specify specific items nor specific sources. The treasure is always sourced from myriad locations around the world, minimizing the chance that any prior possessors notice an absence.
* Instantaneously undo the effects of one battle turn in a battle.

Unlike *wish*, however, *miracles*are fulfilled indirectly, via the intercessory power of the caster’s deity, and successful fulfillment of the *miracle* is contingent on the approval of the deity rather than on the precise wording used. *Miracles*which do not advance the agenda of the deity will invariably go unfulfilled, and unless the *miracle*is obviously self-sacrificing on the part of the divine caster, the deity will subject him to a *quest*when the *miracle*is granted. A *miracle*’s component cost can only be paid for with divine power (p. XX).

###### Palace of Sulaimon

Arcane 8 Type: ritual, summoning

Range: 10’ Duration: 1 day

The ritual summoners 64 hafari (genies of elemental earth) to serve the caster for one day and night (24 hours total) in the construction of a structure. During this time, the hafari will collectively cast 192 of each of the following spells:

* C*reate objects*, conjuring 1,920 st. of goods by master craftsmen worth up to 192,000gp;
* *Earth’s movement*, permitting a total of 1,440,000,000 cubic feet of earthen construction;
* E*arth’s mire* or *earth’s hardening,* transforming a total of 5,760,000 cubic feet of earth into hard rock;
* *Perpetual figment*, weaving illusions covering 12,288,000 in cubic feet, all including visual, auditory, olfactory, and thermal components; and
* *Wall of stone,* creating a total of 96,000gp of stone construction or 960,000gp of decorative re-surfacing.

The typical means by which the *palace* is constructed is for the hafari to use *wall of stone* to create stone molds. The hafari then use *earths’ mire* to transform the nearby earth and rock into mud, and use *earth’s movement* to move the mud into the stone molds. The mud is then hardened with *earth’s hardening,* and the *walls of stone* dispelled to reveal concrete-like stone. The concrete can instead be re-surfaced with decorative *walls of stone* if desired*. Perpetual figments* can be used to decorate the *palace* in almost any conceivable fashion, while *create permanent soft objects* can be used to create carpets, furniture, and tapestries for the new domicile.

The hafari will use these powers to create whatever structure(s) the caster dictates. However, they are only begrudgingly loyal, and if commanded to make ugly, unstable, or impossible structures, they will gleefully comply. To ensure that the construction project is properly constructed, the caster must either be an engineer, or have an engineer at hand to supervise it. A character does not gain XP from a structure constructed using this spell.

Because it actually represents hundreds of castings, a *palace of Sulaimon* cannot be **dispelled**. Specific *objects*, *perpetual figments*, or *walls of stone* can be dispelled by ordinary means, though walls made by moving mud into molds via *earth’s movement* cannot be dispelled (being wholly mundane in nature if not construction).” A *wish* or *miracle* could destroy the entire structure, however.

It is said that Sulaimon, the sorcerer-king who founded the city of Alakyrum, used this mighty ritual to construct his opulent palace in a single night. So glorious was Sulaimon’s palace that it was named one of the seven wonders of the known world. Tragically, the palace was destroyed by the Emperor’s Talons during the Auran conquest of Opelenea.

###### Permanency

Arcane 8, Divine 8 Type: ritual

Range: 15’ Duration: permanent

This ritual makes a particular spell effect permanent. Spells can be made permanent on creatures, items, or areas. Creatures might receive permanent *discern magic, discern evil, flight, giant strength,* and *invulnerability to evil*. Items might be enchanted with permanent *bane-rune, sharpness,* or *striking.* Areas might be imbued with permanent *illumination, spellwarded zone,* or *wall of force.* This is not an exclusive list, and other spells can also be made permanent. However, *permanency* cannot make permanent any spell which has an instantaneous duration, any spell which causes the target of the spell to make a saving throw, or any ritual spell. Divine spells can only be made permanent with the permission of the deity (Judge’s discretion). The Judge can also declare that the *permanency* will not work with any other specific spell that he believes damages game balance.

An area can receive any number of *permanency* spells. An item can receive up to five *permanency* spells, at increasing risk. There is a cumulative 20% chance of failure for each *permanency* after the first, and if the *permanency* fails, it destroys the item completely. A creature can benefit from one *permanency* without risk. If the creature receives further permanency spells, it will begin to suffer side effects. For each additional effect, roll on the Tampering with Mortality table at -1 per additional *permanency*, in addition to other modifiers, and no bonus from caster level.

A *permanency* spell lasts until it is successfully **dispelled** by either the caster or a higher-level spellcaster. When the *permanency* is dispelled, the other spell effect vanishes immediately. Using a permanency to bind a spell to an item is not the same as creating a magic item, which uses a different process. True magic items cannot be dispelled, making them far more durable than items which have merely had spells permanently placed upon them.

###### Plague

Arcane 9 Type: death, ritual

Range: unlimited Duration: 1 month per level

This ritual creates a terrible pestilence that devastates the local population. The *plague* initially targets one 6-mile hex of a domain. The caster must have either visited the target domain, or personally met the ruler of the target domain, in order to target it. Each month, the *plague* spreads to affect each 6-mile hex adjacent to the hexes already affected. Each hex affected by the *plague*loses 1d10! families for every 100 families each month. A hex can only be affected by *plague* if it is settled with at least 100 families.

EXAMPLE: A 1-hex barony with a population of 700 families is subject to a *plague* cast by a 14th level mage. Each month it loses 7d10! families. After 14 months, the barony will have lost 98d10! families. In addition, the *plague* will have spread to many other hexes.

A *plague*also devastates the morale of affected domains. When a *plague* first affects a domain, the domain’s base morale score is immediately reduced by 2 points. Every three months that the *plague* continues thereafter, the domain’s base morale score is reduced by another point. The domain’s morale recovers at a rate of 1 point per month once the *plague* ends.

A *plague* ends if the caster dies or if it has no place to spread (either because it has killed all of the population or there are no settled hexes nearby). Otherwise, it can be ended only by *miracle, wish,* or the expiration of the duration. It cannot be **dispelled**.

###### Ranine Rain

Arcane 7 , Divine 7 Type: ritual, summoning

Range: unlimited Duration: 1 month

This ritual unleashes a supernatural meteorological phenomena commonly called a rain of frogs. The *ranine rain*will affect one domain with an area of up to 16 6-mile hexes (or 1 24-mile hex). Though the ritual has unlimited range, the caster must have either visited the target domain, or personally met the ruler of the target domain. Once the ritual is complete, the hex becomes subject to a set of new weather conditions, “Slimy” and “Foggy,” described below.

**Slimy:** This condition replaces the Drizzly condition. During Slimy conditions, thousands of tiny tadpoles continuously rain down from the sky throughout the day. The tadpoles are too small to cause harm, but being hit by them is disgusting. Creatures in the open during Slimy conditions must make a Blast saving throw each turn. If the save succeeds, the creature is unaffected that turn. If the save fails, the creature becomes **queasy** from disgust for one turn. If the save fails on an unmodified 1, the creature accidentally gets tadpoles in its mouth or nose, and begins **vomiting** for one turn.

**Froggy:** This condition replaces the Rainy condition. During Froggy conditions, thousands of frogs shower down from the heavens throughout the day. Most of the frogs die messily when they hit the ground, but those fortunate enough to fall in soft ground, mud, or water survive and begin to hop around. The falling frogs reduce maximum visibility distance to 60’, and all creatures outdoors suffer a -1 penalty to avoid surprise due to the croaking, hopping, and spattering frogs. Land Surveying, Navigation, Searching, and Tracking proficiency throws also suffer a -4 penalty, but Survival proficiency throws to hunt automatically succeed – it's frog legs for dinner, boys! Wandering monsters encountered during Froggy conditions have a 50% chance to be giant frogs, regardless of terrain. Finally, creatures in the open during Froggy conditions must make a Blast saving throw each turn. If the save succeeds, the creature is unaffected that turn. If the save fails, the creature is struck by a frog for 1d4 mundane bludgeoning damage. If the save fails on a natural 1, the creature accidentally swallows a frog. Such unlucky fools must make a successful Death save or be slain by choking or poison.

The effects of the *ranine rain* over time can be quite damaging to the domain. The domain’s base morale score is reduced by 1 point as soon as a Slimy or Froggy day occurs, and by an additional point for every five days of Slimy or Froggy conditions thereafter. (The domain’s morale recovers at a rate of 1 point per month once the *ranine rain* ends.) The families residing in the hex cannot safely work during Froggy conditions. If permitted to shelter at home, domain revenue is reduced by 3% each day of Froggy conditions. If forced to work, the peasants lose 1d10! families per 100 families in the domain. At the end of the month, if the number of Froggy days exceeds twice the land value, the land value is reduced by 1 from environmental damage. A *ranine rain* ends if the caster dies. Otherwise, it can be ended only by *miracle, wish,* or the expiration of the duration. It cannot be **dispelled**.

###### Resurrection\*

Divine 8 Type: healing, ritual

Range: touchDuration: instantaneous

This ritual functions like *restore life and limb*, except that upon completion of the spell, the recipient is immediately restored to full hit points, vigor, and health, with no side effects or lingering exhaustion. Any existing permanent wounds or side effects are removed. The condition of the recipient’s remains is not a factor. So long as some small portion of the recipient’s body still exists, it can be *resurrected*. However, the recipient must not have died before the caster was born and must not have died of old age.

*Destruction,* the reverse of *resurrection*, causes the living creature touched by the caster to die immediately and fall to dust with no saving throw. A creature slain by *destruction* cannot be restored to life by any means short of *miracle* or *wish*.

###### Seven-League Stride

Arcane 7, Divine 7 Type: movement, ritual

Range: touch Duration: see below

When this ritual is cast, the spellcaster designates a recipient and a destination. The destination must be known to the caster, either from an accurate map, first-hand visit, *scrying,* etc. The recipient can travel towards the destination at great speed, traversing seven leagues (21 miles) with every stride while carrying up to its full encumbrance load.

Though very fast, the journey is not instantaneous. To calculate the number of rounds required for the trip, divide the distance in miles to the designated location by 210. For instance, if the designated location is 1,680 miles away, the recipient will arrive 8 minutes after it sets out.

The recipient only dimly perceives its surroundings during its journey, as the terrain features pass by in a blur of speed, and thus might lose his way. The recipient must make a proficiency throw to avoid getting lost (affected normally by the terrain at the designated location). If the throw fails, each point by which the throw was missed increases the actual time passed by 25%.

A *seven-league stride* cannot be **dispelled**.

###### Shadeveil

Arcane: 9                          Type: illusion, enchantment, transmogrification, ritual

Range: 12 miles               Duration: Special

*Shadeveil* is an old, potent ritual first invoked by the ancient elves to protect their woodland realms from the encroachment of man and dwarf. A more sinister, warped version of the ritual was said to be perfected by the ancient Zaharans during their rise to power, though it is possible some Chthonic cult of elvenkind is the true culprit and the *shadeveil* is their final legacy before being butchered by the surgent Thrassians.

The *shadeveil* ritual infuses a target domain with potent dweomers. All of the target domain’s territory must be in range of the spell, and the domain cannot occupy more than one 24-mile hex. The caster decides which aspect of the ritual to invoke at the time of casting, either cloaking the area in a *secret veil* or shrouding it in a *living nightmare*.

A *secret veil*draws upon the power of illusion and enchantment to prevent unwanted intrusion into a protected domain and discourages potential interlopers and invaders. A domain under this version of the spell gains the following:

* The entire domain is infused with illusions of misdirection and concealment. Creatures that enter the domain are automatically affected by these illusions with no saving throw. Affected creatures can only discern what the caster wishes them to see – a town can look like a grove of trees, a grassy expanse can be a field of lava, or a mountain path an impenetrable mass of sticky webs. The magical misdirection and shifting, illusory landscapes make it impossible for affected creatures to succeed on Mapping, Land Surveying, and Navigation proficiency throws. Affected creatures’ minds will rationalize moving through these landscapes, avoiding obstacles and impassible terrain, without disturbing the illusion.
* Sapient creatures traveling in the domain can find themselves unknowingly diverted to the nearest exist. Each creature must make a Spells saving throw every hour. (If the creatures are traveling as a unit, roll once for the unit as a whole using the unit leader’s throw.) If the save fails, the creature(s) or unit move in a straight line to the closest possible point of exit to the area of the spell. The affected creature(s) will believe they have maintained their desired direction.
* For each caster level, one structure, such as a tower, bridge, or statue, can be cloaked in *invisibility*. However, the caster and any creatures he designates can see the invisible structures normally.
* For each caster level, a single path, trail, road, or waterway can be excluded from the spell if the caster desires. This permits “safe” travel along these routes.
* For one hour per day, the caster or a designated guardian (see below) can use an ordinary mirror, crystal ball, pool, or similar reflective surface to *scry* (as the spell) anywhere within the spell’s area.

A *living nightmare* does the following:

* The domain is shrouded in a dismal and foreboding shadowscape. Creatures that enter the affected area are automatically affected by the shadowscape with no saving throw. Affected creatures reduce their movement by half (on top of any terrain modifiers) and reduce their visibility distance to just 30’. The magical misdirection combined with the constantly grasping, tripping, twisting landscape makes it impossible for affected creatures to succeed on Mapping, Land Surveying, and Navigation proficiency throws.
* The domain is abandoned, becoming unsettled, with all inhabitants departing over a period of 1d6 months. After 12 months, the entire domain becomes a *shadowed sinkhole of evil*.
* All animals in the domain attempt to flee. Those that are unable to flee die within 1d12 months (and might thereafter rise as undead). All normal plants slowly wither and die over 1d12 months. The dead remnants then begin to horrifically warp into bleak, thorny, and misshapen forms.
* Sapient creatures traveling in the domain can find themselves unknowingly diverted away from the nearest exit. Each creature must make a Spells saving throw every hour. (If the creatures are traveling as a unit, roll once for the unit as a whole using the unit leader’s throw.) If the save fails, the creature(s) or unit spends the hour wandering in circles with no sense of direction.
* A sense of hopelessness, fear, and misery affects the minds of those within. Whether traveling or stationary, each sapient creature in the domain must make another Spells saving throw every hour. If the save fails, the creature suffers one of the following effects (roll 1d12):
  + 1-2: The creature suffers a living nightmare in which it is “killed.” The creature must make a Death saving throw. If the save succeeds, it becomes **slumbering** for 1d12 rounds. If the save fails, it becomes **slumbering** for 1d12 hours.
  + 3-4: The creature experiences a traumatic event, either a real vision from its past or an imagined event that plays into its worst dread. Grief and misery root it to the spot, leaving it **cowering** for 1d10 turns.
  + 5-6: The creature experiences a waking dream in which it is beset by enemies or terrible beasts. The creature becomes **infuriated** and immediately attacks the closest sapient creature (usually an ally) and continues to do so for 1d10 rounds before coming to its senses.
  + 7-8: The creature encounters one of its worst fears, causing it to become **frightened** for 1d10 turns. The creature will run in a random direction, believing itself to be relentlessly “pursued” by the illusion.
  + 9-10: A wave of exhaustion overcomes the creature. The creature must make a Death saving throw. If the save succeeds, the creature becomes **fatigued** for 1d6 turns. If the save fails, the creature is **slumbering** for 1d10 hours.
  + 11-12: A random encounter appropriate to the terrain is triggered. Combat ensues but the creatures are illusory, disappearing when hit. Damage sustained, however, remains.
* Sapient creatures slain in the domain become haunts (see ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual***).

When the ritual is cast, the caster can decide who, aside from himself, will be unaffected by the ritual in either form. This decision is permanent for the duration of the ritual. If the caster chooses, he can craft special talismans which ward off the ritual’s effects on whichever creatures carry them. Crafting a *shadeveil* talisman has a material cost, component cost, and research cost of 500gp.

Once complete, the ritual lasts for 12 months. However, the caster can extend the ritual duration by linking the *shadeveil* with the life force of a living creature.

In the case of a *secret veil,* the caster can designate a willing living creature to be the guardian of the veil. Thereafter, as long as the guardian remains alive and stays within the domain, the ritual’s duration will remain in effect perpetually. In the days of old, it was common for long-lived creatures such as sphinxes, treeherders, and unicorns to be chosen as guardians.

In the case of a *living nightmare,* the caster can designate a living creature to become the cursed victim of the nightmare. The creature does not have to be willing, but it must be magically put to sleep (usually by *slumber* or *deep slumber*) in order to become the cursed victim. Once asleep, the victim enters into a perpetual nightmare that slowly consumes their soul. Each year that it slumbers, the victim ages 1d10 years. If the creature dies, it becomes a specter doomed to haunt (and sustain) the domain.

A *shadeveil* can be **dispelled** by a *remove curse* spell by a higher level spellcaster than the creator of the ritual. Alternatively, the *shadeveil* can be dispelled by removing or killing the guardian of the *secret veil*, waking up the victim of the *living nightmare,* or destroying the specter the victim has become. A *wish* or *miracle* could also end the ritual.

###### Spawn of the Deep

Arcane 7, Divine 7 Type: ritual, summoning

Range: 480’ Duration: 1 day

This ritual summons one of the most terrible archfiends of Lammala -- Cthaylor of the Deep – from the watery depths. It can only be performed within range of a well of elemental water that is connected to or in the ocean. When the ritual is complete, dread Cthaylor arises from the well of elemental water to serve the caster.

Sages who have studied the lore of Cthaylor – and they are few – believe that she was once a powerful elven enchantress in Southern Argollë, seduced by wicked influences of Lammala and transformed into a cacodemon by ritual magic. Whatever her origins, Cthaylor stands 36’ tall and weighs over 40,000 lbs. Her form, though humanoid, is bloated to colossal size, with skin a loathsome, rubbery texture the color of seaweed. Cthaylor’s hands and feet terminate in claw-like nails, each one the size and color of a narwhal horn. From her back arise a pair of great fins, almost resembling vestigial wings. In lieu of hair, Cthaylor’s brow is crowned with a writhing mass of pale tentacles, each one undulating with a life of its own as if to some unheard rhythm. But what is most horrific of all is the creature’s face: for dread Cthaylor carries the visage of fair-eyed elven woman of surpassing beaty and grace, a beauty transformed into an abomination by the rest of the creature’s body. From her lavish lips she utters a constant trilling song; to those who can speak Ancient Zaharan, her words are recognizable as litanies of remorse for lost love, but to others it is the ghastly sound of damnation.

Dread Cthaylor acts on her own initiative. As a servant of Chaos, she will assist the caster in the pursuit of fell deeds that serve to bring destruction and ruin into the world. She will not pursue tasks that she deems beneath her majesty, nor courses of action that are motivated by benevolence or compassion or that work towards Lawful or even Neutral ends. Any such requests will cause Cthaylor to return to the water depths. Otherwise, Cthaylor will serve until destroyed or **dispelled** by a caster of higher level than the summoner or until a full day has elapsed.

**Cthaylor of the Deep:** Archfiend; CON 18; Size Colossal (16,000 st), AC 12, Spd 40’/120’ or 60’/180’ (swim), HD 24\*\*\*\*\*\*\*, hp 200, #AT 6 (2 claws, 4 tentacles -9+) or 1 (trample -9+), Dmg 3d10/3d10/1d10/1d10/1d10/1d10 or 9d10, Save F24, ML +3, AL C, XP 23,000; Special Abilities: *capsizing wave* (1/turn), enthralling song (as harpy), immunity (necrotic damage, poisonous damage, all mundane damage), massive size, spellcasting, *water breathing* (at will), *telepathy* (at will); Spells per day 5 1st, 5 2nd, 5 3rd, 5 4th, 5 5th, 5 6th ; Caster Level 20th; Repertoire: 1st – *conjure cacodemon spawn, counterspell, desiccate, discern magic, ice floe;* 2nd – *conjure imp, discern invisible, rain of vitriol, shrouding fog, swimming;* 3 – *cone of frost, dispel magic, ice sheet, incite madness, infuriate crowd*; 4th -  *cloud of poison, scry, sunder structure, wall of frost, weave water;* 5th – *carnage, conjure dybbuk, conjure supreme elemental, ice storm, summon weather, teleportation;* 6th – *anti-magic sphere, conjure fiend, control weather, level water, locate place of power*

**Designer’s Note:** While the ritual itself is specific to Cthaylor, the Judge’s campaign world can of course include similar rituals that summon other archfiends of his own design.

###### Undead Legion

Arcane 9 Type: death, ritual

Range: touch Duration: permanent

This ritual can only be cast in a place of death (such as a cemetery, catacomb, or battleground). When it is complete, the spellcaster raises an *undead legion*under his command from the corpses and skeletons residing therein. The *undead legion*will include a number of Hit Dice of skeletons or zombies equal to 400 times caster level, subject to the maximum number of dead in his area. Whether the *undead legion*consists of skeletons or zombies will depend on the state of the corpses in the surrounding area. Animated skeletons have Hit Dice equal to the number the monster had in life, excluding class levels; for skeletons of humans or demi-humans, this means one Hit Die, regardless of the class level of the deceased. Zombies have one more Hit Die than the monster had in life.

EXAMPLE: Sebek, a 14th level mage, travels to the catacombs of Old Zahar, in order to perform the *undead legion*ritual. After 9 weeks, his Magic Research throw succeeds, so he animates 5,600 Hit Dice of undead. Since the Old Zaharans mummified the dead, the corpses are relatively intact and become zombies. Sebek’s *undead legion*consists of 2,800 2 HD human zombies.

The caster can give verbal orders to the members of the *undead legion* when they rise and thereafter anytime they are in line of sight on his initiative. Complex or extensive orders require the caster to expend an action in lieu of moving, but simple orders (“protect me!”) do not require an action. Orders can be given in any language the caster speaks. The animated undead will mindlessly obey whatever orders they are given to the best of their (limited) ability. They cannot accomplish tasks that require abstract thought or higher reasoning. If they complete all of their orders, or for whatever reason are physically unable to obey their orders, the undead will simply remain stationary until they receive new orders. The undead act on their own initiative each round.

The members of the*undead legion*remain animated until they are destroyed or **dispelled**. Note that if *undead legion*is cast in a **sinkhole of evil**, the spellcaster will calculate the spell effects as if he were one or more class levels higher than his actual level of experience. Rules for **sinkholes of evil** can be found in the ***ACKS II Judges Journal***.

###### Wish

Arcane 9 Type: ritual

Range: unlimited Duration: special

*Wish* is the mightiest spell that any arcane caster can perform. By simply speaking aloud, the caster can alter reality. This spell can accomplish unique effects that are otherwise impossible for mere mortals. Some examples of what a *wish* can do include:

* Create a blast of fire, cloud of poison, or other effect that deals 1d6 extraordinary damage to up to 1,920 creatures in a 50,000 square foot area of effect with no saving throw — enough to destroy 16 companies, 4 battalions, or 1 brigade of ordinary troops.
* Instantaneously create magical construct(s) or magic item(s) with a total base cost of up to 200,000gp.
* Crossbreed any two creatures in line of sight. (Unwilling creatures can make a Spells saving throw to resist the effect.)
* Destroy a magic item worth up to 200,000gp base cost that was created by arcane magic.
* **Dispel** any other spell, heal any disease, or remove any curse, by any source.
* Eliminate any and all existing side effects from tampering with mortality in one creature.
* Instantaneously end another ritual spell. Any ritual spell can be ended except where otherwise noted in its entry.
* Instantaneously grant a class proficiency or class power to a named creature, at the cost of also giving it a side effect from the Tampering with Mortality table.
* Heal up to 960 creatures in line of sight of 1d6 damage.
* Instantaneously raise one of a named creature’s ability scores to 18, at the cost of it suffering a side effect from the Tampering with Mortality table.
* Restore 30 slain creatures to life as if by *restore life and limb*.
* Slay a named creature or creature in line of sight. The creature can make a Death saving throw to resist the effect.
* Teleport up to 30 creatures within line of sight to any place in any sphere of existence without error.
* Instantaneously transfer up to 600,000gp of precious metals, jewelry, merchandise, and/or livestock to the caster’s possession. The caster cannot specify specific items nor specific sources. The treasure is always sourced from myriad locations around the world, minimizing the chance that any prior possessors notice an absence.
* Instantaneously undo the effects of one battle turn in a battle.

*Wishes* will be fulfilled according to the letter of the request, and the Judge can exercise some regulation of *wishes* based on this strict enforcement. Ultimately, the Judge will have to decide the limits of a *wish* spell.

###### Youthfulness

Divine 7 Type: healing, ritual

Range: touch Duration: instantaneous

This ritual restores the recipient touched to the prime of his life. His age is re-set to the first year of the adult category for his species and any and all aging penalties he has accrued are removed. Such a radical rejuvenation of the body can come with serious consequences. The recipient must roll 1d20 and 1d6 on the Tampering with Mortality table for his alignment and suffer the resulting side effect. This roll is modified only by the character’s WIL and age.

Those who would prefer to avoid the unpleasantries that come with tampering with mortality have another choice. If the caster conducts a sufficient amount of blood sacrificing (see p. XX) during the ritual, the recipient can avoid rolling on the Tampering with Mortality table entirely by bathing in the blood of the victims. The amount of divine power that must be supplied by blood sacrifice is equal to the recipient’s age multiplied by 100. This cost is in addition to the component cost of the ritual itself, which must be paid separately. For purposes of calculating the divine power, the recipient’s relationship to the sacrificial victim counts instead of the caster’s.

EXAMPLE: Akasha, a 12th level Zaharan ruinguard, has reached the age of 79. Faced with the prospect of oblivion or undeath, she seeks out the chthonic priest Xisuthros to perform the ritual of *youthfulness* upon her. When informed of the grave risks of such a ritual, she decides to resort to blood sacrifice. She will need (79 x 100) = 7,900 XP in blood sacrifice. She calculates that around 800 0th level virgins purchased in the flesh-market of Zahar should suffice for her bath of blood…

### Magic Experimentation

Magic experimentation is a rare practice. In the thousands of years since the arts of magic were first undertaken by mortals, countless spellcasters have penned formula and devised items. The majority of magic research entails following the formulas and methods lain down by the ancient masters, or perhaps re-engineering some device from a sample discovered in an old trove. Occasionally, ambitious researchers devise new spells or entirely new magic items, but this is rare. The risk of loss of components, materials, and — most of all — time, is simply too great to be countenanced by temples and towers of learning. Rarer still are those researchers who will push beyond the ordinary limits of magic and achieve great deeds of renown.

Anytime a researcher conducts a research project that requires a magic research throw, he can choose to engage in **magic experimentation**. By eschewing the ordinary parameters of practice and safety, experimenters can gain an **experimental advantage** such as speedier progress or superior insight. With luck, an experimenter may even achieve a **breakthrough**, resulting in a more powerful spell or item than expected. However, if the magic research fails, the experimenter will suffer a **mishap**. The experimental advantage gained, and the harm caused by a mishap, is determined by the experimenter’s **method of experimentation**.

###### Experimental Advantage

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Advantage** | **Effect of Advantage** |
| Haste | Doubles research rate |
| Efficiency | Doubles value of special components |
| Insight | Grants +2 bonus on research throw |
| Lore | Allows esoteric spells (1st – 2nd level) |

By performing an experiment, a researcher gains his choice of one or more advantages, choosing from **haste**, **efficiency**, **insight,** or **lore**. Haste doubles the research rate of the experimenter. Efficiency doubles the value of special components expended on the project. Insight grants a +2 bonus to the experimenter’s magic research throw. Lore allows the experimenter to enchant an esoteric spell of 1st or 2nd level into an activated or permanent item.

An experimenter can (but doesn’t have to) select the same advantage multiple times. If he does, the bonus is cumulative. Selecting haste or efficiency twice causes the research rate or component value to triple (x3), while selecting haste or efficiency three times causes the research rate or component value to quadruple (x4). Selecting lore twice allows up to 4th level esoteric spells or a bonus greater than +3 versus a particular monster type, and selecting lore three times allows up to 6th level esoteric spells to be enchanted or a bonus greater than +3 versus all monsters.

###### Method of Experimentation

When a spellcaster choose to experiment, he may choose from **conventional**, **pioneering**, or **radical** methods. Conventional experiments rely on the customary approaches of collegiate wizards, designed to create incremental gains with minimum risk. Examples would be slight changes to magical algorithms, minor adjustments to potion or scroll formula, and so on. Pioneering experiments seek significant advances at greater risk. A pioneering experiment might deploy new paradigms of magical theory or major changes to customary formulas and may draw on alternative traditions outside the spellcaster’s craft. Radical experiments risk catastrophe to accomplish the otherwise impossible. Radical experiments use highly dangerous and often forbidden practices, such as directly accessing extraplanar forces, binding demons, or blood magic.

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Method of**  **Experimentation** | **Experimental**  **Advantages** | **Result of Failed**  **Experiment** | **Minimum**  **Level** |
| Conventional | 1 Advantage | Minor Mishap | 5th |
| Pioneering | 2 Advantages | Major Mishap | 9th |
| Radical | 3 Advantages | Catastrophic Mishap | 11th |

Using conventional methods grants one experimental advantage, but triggers **minor mishaps** if the research fails. Using pioneering methods grants two experimental advantages, while triggering **major mishaps** if the research fails. Using radical methods grants three experimental advantages, but triggers **catastrophic mishaps** if the research fails. (Remember that an unmodified die roll of 1 – 3 is an automatic failure. Any spellcaster using experimental methods risks at least a 15% chance of a mishap!) An experimenter must reach the required minimum level shown before he can use that method of experimentation. (After all, a caster who has not mastered the basics of his art cannot hope to push the boundaries.)

A research assistant can directly aid an experimenter without having to meet the experiment’s minimum level. A research assistant working semi-independently cannot engage in magic experimentation.

###### Mishaps

When an experiment fails, the experimenter must roll 1d10 on whichever Mishap table is appropriate for the type of research he was attempting (e.g. creating a construct or researching a spell) and suffer the effect listed in the column matching the degree of mishap. Some of the results on the Mishap tables require that the spellcaster roll on other tables; these are either in the ***ACKS II Judges Journal***, or listed after the Mishaps tables.

Research assistants aiding an experiment can be affected by mishaps, but the danger is not as great as for the experimenter himself. If a minor mishap occurs, the assistants are unaffected. If a major mishap occurs, the assistants are each affected by the equivalent minor mishap. If a catastrophic mishap occurs, the assistants are each affected by the equivalent major mishap.

###### Breakthroughs

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Level of Breakthrough** | **Threshold of Success** | **Required Method** | **Min. Level** |
| Minor | Target Value Exceeded by 5+ | Any | 7th |
| Major | Target Value Exceeded by 10+ | Pioneering or Radical | 9th |
| Revolutionary | Target Value Exceeded by 20+ | Radical | 11th |

A breakthrough occurs when the experimenter’s magic research throw exceeds his target value by a particular threshold.

A **minor breakthrough** occurs when the target value is exceeded by 5+. A **major breakthrough** is achieved when the target value is exceeded by 10+. A **revolutionary breakthrough** is achieved when the target value is exceeded by 20+.

However, regardless of the throw, conventional experiments cannot achieve better than minor breakthroughs, while pioneering experiments cannot achieve better than major breakthroughs. Additionally, spellcasters must reach a certain minimum level before they are able to achieve certain levels of breakthrough. (Again, a caster who has not mastered the basics of his art cannot hope to push the boundaries.) The requirements to achieve a breakthrough are summarized on the Level of Breakthroughs table. When the magic throw results in a breakthrough exceeding that permitted by the caster’s level or method of experimentation, the highest level of breakthrough that would be permitted occurs instead.

The results of a breakthrough depends on the type of magical research and the level of the breakthrough. The Results of Breakthroughs table summarizes the benefits of various levels of breakthrough for different types of research.

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Type of Magical Research** | **Minor Breakthrough** | **Major Breakthrough** | **Revolutionary Breakthrough** |
| Creating Magic Items | Minor bonus effect | Notable bonus effect | Powerful bonus effect |
| Crossbreeding Creatures | 1 ability (roll 3d6) | 2 abilities (roll 2d10) | 3 abilities (roll 1d20) |
| Designing Construct | +2 HD maximum | +6 HD maximum | +12 HD maximum |
| Manufacturing Constructs | 1 ability (roll 3d6) | 2 abilities (roll 2d10) | 3 abilities (roll 1d20) |
| Performing Necromancy | 1 ability (roll 3d6) | 2 abilities (roll 2d10) | 3 abilities (roll 1d20) |
| Researching Spell/Ritual | +1/2 spell level | +1 spell level | +2 spell levels |
| Ritual Casting | +1/2 spell level | +1 spell level | +2 spell levels |

**Creating Magic Items**: The magic item unexpectedly gains additional powers as a result of the breakthrough. A minor breakthrough gives the item a minor bonus effect, such as a +1 bonus versus a particular monster type or additional spell effect(s) of lower level than its existing effects worth up to 50% of the item’s cost. A major breakthrough results provides the item with a notable bonus effect, such as a +2 bonus versus a particular monster type or additional spell effect(s) of similar level to its existing effects, worth up to the item’s cost. A revolutionary breakthrough results in the item acquiring a powerful bonus effect, such as a +3 bonus versus a particular monster type, or acquiring additional spell effect(s) of similar or even higher level worth up to twice the item’s cost.

Bonus effect types can have the same effect type as the item’s primary effect type, or a less expensive effect type (Judge’s discretion based on cost). The Judge may roll randomly to choose spell-like effect(s) (as per a spell scroll) or select them based on the context and history of the item. The bonus effects do not increase the cost of this project. The bonus effects are not part of the item’s formula, so researchers working from the item’s formula will not replicate the bonus effects. However, a researcher who uses the item as a sample can thereafter create a copy that does replicate the item’s bonus effects (at the full cost!).

EXAMPLE #1: Quintus has achieved a minor breakthrough while enchanting a **sword +2***.* The item gains a +1 bonus versus a particular monster type. Quintus has long warred against the beastmen of the Waste, so the Judge decides this hatred has imbued itself into the weapon, making it a **sword +2, +3 versus beastmen***.* For purposes of Quintus’s project, the **sword +2**retains its 15,000gp component, material, and research cost. The formula produced by Quintus’s research is also for a **sword +2**. However, Quintus could now use the sword as a sample for a new 25,000gp magic research project to create a **sword +2, +3 vs. beastmen***.*

EXAMPLE #2: Elaria has achieved a revolutionary breakthrough while enchanting a **ring of invisibility**. A **ring of invisibility**is built as a 3rd level spell available once per turn for a cost of 15,000gp. The revolutionary breakthrough grants additional spell effect(s) of 3rd level or higher, useable once per day or less frequently, costing up to 30,000gp. The **ring**is intended as a gift for Elaria’s friend Fogrimm to use while exploring dungeons, so the Judge decides that the **ring**also grants the wearer **inaudibility**and **shrinking**once per day. For purposes of Elaria’s research project, the *ring* retains its 15,000gp component, material, and research costs, and the project yields a formula for a **ring of invisibility**. However, Elaria could now use the ring as a sample to research the 45,000gp **ring of invisibility, inaudibility, and shrinking***.*

**Crossbreeding Creatures**: A breakthrough results in the crossbreed gaining special abilities that were not present in the progenitor creatures. Such abilities are the result of unexpected synergies between the two progenitors. A minor breakthrough provides the crossbreed with 1 special ability. A major breakthrough provides the crossbreed with 2 special abilities. A revolutionary breakthrough provides the crossbreed with 3 special abilities. Major and revolutionary breakthroughs tend to provide more powerful abilities. The Judge may select appropriate special abilities or have the player roll on the Unexpected Abilities table using the listed die. The additional special abilities do not increase the costs of creating the crossbreed. The unexpected abilities can be transmitted to new creatures in future crossbreeding if desired.

EXAMPLE: Artashumara has achieved a revolutionary breakthrough while crossbreeding a hellhound with a stegosaurus to create a hellish luposaurus (AC 6, Move 120’, HD 11, Attacks 1 tail or 1 trample, or fiery breath, Dmg 2d8/2d6/11d6, ML +1, detects invisibility 60’). He rolls 1d20 three times on the Unexpected Abilities table. His first roll is an 8, gaining a swallow attack. The Judge decides that when the luposaurus hits with its tail on a natural 19-20, it flings creatures smaller than itself into its maw. Artashumara’s second roll is a 4, a breath weapon. The hellish luposaurus already has a breath weapon, so he re-rolls and gets a 7, immunity. The Judge rules that the luposaurus is immune to fire, to correspond with its breath weapon. Artashumara’s third roll is an 18, petrification. The follow-on roll determines that the luposaurus petrifies creatures struck by its attacks. The Judge justifies this by saying that the creature’s extreme heat instantly petrifies living tissue. (Clearly the creature must enjoy eating calcified flesh, since it swallows its victims whole…).

**Designing Constructs**: Innovative design techniques and cutting-edge engineering allows the experimenter to exceed his normal design parameters. A minor breakthrough increases the HD limit by 2, a major breakthrough by 6, and a revolutionary breakthrough by 12. The breakthrough does not increase the material or research cost that the experimenter must pay to complete the design. The construct’s higher HD are part of the formula, and increase the material cost and research cost to actually manufacture the construct. However, the additional HD do not increase the level required to manufacture the construct.

EXAMPLE: Quintus achieves a revolutionary breakthrough while designing a 28\*\* HD construct. Quintus’s design will be for a construct of 40\*\* HD. The design still has a material cost and research cost of 66,000gp each. If Quintus or another researcher later manufactures the construct, the material cost and research cost will be 90,000gp each. Even though the construct is 40 HD, it can be manufactured from the formula by a 14th level caster (because it originally had 28 HD).

**Manufacturing Constructs**: Unexpected synergies during the construction process yield special abilities that were not present in the experimenter’s formula. A minor breakthrough provides the construct with 1 special ability, a major breakthrough provides 2 special abilities, and a revolutionary breakthrough provides 3 special abilities. Major and revolutionary breakthroughs tend to provide more powerful abilities. The Judge may select appropriate special abilities or have the player roll on the Unexpected Abilities table using the listed die. The additional special abilities do not increase the costs of manufacturing this construct. Future research working from this formula will not replicate the breakthrough. However, a researcher who uses the newly-manufactured construct as a sample can design a construct that replicates the construct’s special abilities.

EXAMPLE: Quintus is manufacturing a construct using the formula for a 20\* HD bronze golem. However, through experimentation, he has achieved a minor breakthrough. He rolls 3d6 once on the Unexpected Abilities table and gets a 9, indicating ongoing damage. The Judge determines that when the bronze golem hits, it seizes hold of its victim and can squeeze it each round for 3d10 more damage. Although the bronze golem is now 20\*\* HD, the manufacturing project still has a material cost and research cost of 45,000gp.

Quintus’s formula is still just for a 45,000gp research project to manufacture a 20\* HD bronze golem. However, Quintus or another researcher could use the newly-made bronze golem as a sample for a 50,000gp research project to design a 20\*\* HD bronze golem.

**Performing Necromancy**: The dark magic used in the experiment results in the undead gaining unexpected special abilities. Where the undead has the ability to reproduce (e.g. ghouls), this may result in the creation of an entirely new sub-type of undead in the world! A minor breakthrough provides the undead with 1 special ability. A major breakthrough provides the undead with 2 special abilities. A revolutionary breakthrough provides the undead with 3 special abilities. Major and revolutionary breakthroughs tend to provide more powerful abilities. The Judge may select appropriate special abilities or roll on the Unexpected Abilities table using the listed die. The additional special abilities do not increase the researcher’s costs of performing this necromancy. After completing the research, the researcher counts as familiar with the breakthrough undead, and can thereafter perform necromancy to deliberately create the undead.

EXAMPLE: Sargon is performing necromancy to transform a henchman into a 5+1\* HD mummy. Through experimentation, he has achieved a major breakthrough. He rolls 2d10 twice on the Unexpected Abilities table. The first roll is a 16, so the mummy is massive size. The result is a 10+2 HD mummy that deals 2d12 damage with its strike. The second roll is a 10, “Bonus Attack,” with a follow-on d6 result of 3. The mummy gains a bonus melee attack identical to the mummy’s primary attack. Since its primary attack has gained double damage (2d12), so does its bonus attack. Brutal! Sargon’s component, material, and research cost for this project is still only 15,000gp. In the future, Sargon can perform necromancy to create 10+2\*\* HD giant mummies, but the cost will be 30,000gp.

**Researching Spells**: When researching spells, breakthroughs increase the power of the spell without increasing its actual spell level. A minor breakthrough raises the spell’s power by 1/2 level (i.e. mid-way to the next level). A major breakthrough raises the spell’s power by 1 level. A revolutionary breakthrough raises the spell’s power by 2 levels. In this way, low level spells can be created which are as powerful as higher level spells. Once such a spell is created, other arcane casters can learn it from spellbooks and scrolls normally. Many of the most famous and popular spells were created in this way.For example, the 3rd level *fireball* was the result of a revolutionary breakthrough that resulted in a spell as powerful as the 5th level *ice storm*. It is up to the Judge to determine if a breakthrough spell counts as “common” thereafter in his campaign.

**Ritual Learning:** When learning rituals, breakthroughs increase the power of the ritual without increasing its actual ritual level. A minor breakthrough raises the ritual’s power by 1/2 level (i.e. mid-way to the next level). A major breakthrough raises the ritual’s power by 1 level. A revolutionary breakthrough raises the ritual’s power by 2 levels. *Miracle* and *wish* are examples of breakthroughs, being effectively 11th level in power. The formula produced by the successful completion of the project can thereafter be used by other researchers to learn the ritual according to the usual rules.

**Ritual Casting:** When casting ritual spells, breakthroughs increase the power of the spell, as per ritual learning above. However, the increase in power occurs only for that particular instance of the ritual. Achieving a revolutionary breakthroughwhile casting **cataclysm** will wreak incredible havoc, but the next **cataclysm** the caster performs will have its usual effects.

| 1 | You either (50% either way) shrink to half size (as per *shrinking*)or grow to giant size (as per a *growth*). You are unused to your new size, and your DEX is immediately reduced to 3. Each week spent at your new size increases your DEX by 1 point until it reaches its normal score. |
| 2 | You acquire the characteristics of the animal that your character most resembles (Judge’s discretion). As a result of this change, 3 attributes will be increased by 2 points, and 3 other attributes will be decreased by 2 points. |
| 3 | Your skin thickens like rhinoceros hide. You gain a bonus of +2 to your armor class, but lose 1 point of DEX and CHA because the skin is clumsy and unattractive. |

| 4 | All non-magical plants near you wilt and die whenever you cast a spell. The effect extends around you to a radius of 1’ per spell level. Plant-like monsters within the area of effect take 1 point of damage per spell level. |
| 5 | A faint and unpleasant aroma lingers around you whenever you cast a spell. The stench remains for 1 turn (10 minutes) per spell level. While it lingers, you suffer a -3 penalty on reaction rolls. |
| 6 | When you cast a spell, everything around you seems hideous and rotten, as if from a terrible nightmare. You suffer a -2 penalty to saving throws for 1 round per spell level. |
| 7 | When you cast a spell, you feel disembodied and ghostly, as if in a dream. You suffer a -1 to initiative and -2 to attack throws for 1 round per spell level. |
| 8 | Your spell signature makes normal animals angry and fearful. Any within 10’ will immediately attack you (if wild) or flee (if domesticated). The effect lasts for 1 turn (10 minutes) per spell level. |
| 9 | After you cast a spell, you experience nerve-wracking sensations (e.g. bugs crawling on your skin or restless limbs). The sensations are not actually harmful, but they are so distracting that you suffer a -2 penalty to initiative. The effect lasts for 1 round per level. Repeatedly casting spells makes the initiative penalty cumulative as the sensations become increasingly overwhelming. If you become undead, this effect is removed. |
| 10 | Your magic diffuses into your spell signature, rather than channeling into your spells. Any damaging spells do 1 less point of damage per die, and saving throws against your magic are at +2. |
| 11 | After you cast a spell, you emanate a painful glow, equal to a *perpetual illumination* spell, for one round per spell level. (If chaotic, you instead emanate a magical *perpetual tenebrosity*). |
| 12 | A tumultuous cacophony fills the air for one round after you cast a spell. Any creatures within 120’ will automatically hear the sound, even if there is a battle or other loud noise nearby. |
| 13 | Your body cools to an icy temperature after you cast a spell, and remains frigid for 1 round per spell level. Unless you are wearing winter clothing, you suffer a -4 penalty to attack throws, saving throws, and initiative rolls from the cold. If you become undead, this effect is removed. |
| 14 | Your body rises to a very warm temperature after you cast a spell, and remains fevered for 1 round per spell level. If you are wearing anything heavier than underclothes, you suffer a -4 penalty to attack throws, saving throws, and initiative rolls from the heat. If you become undead, this effect is removed. |
| 15 | Your spell signature is filled with glorious images that entrance and seduce you. You cannot take any action for 1 round after you cast a spell. |
| 16 | Whenever you cast a spell, your shadow transforms into the monster of the same name. The shadow has 1 HD per spell level and attacks you ceaselessly until destroyed. If you cast spells in total darkness, this prevents the effect. |
| 17 | Your magic burns you with power. Each time you cast a spell, any flammable material you carry is ignited. This includes most clothing, torches, paper, oil, etc. If any material is ignited, you suffer 1d8 damage for 2 rounds. |
| 18 | You must pay for your spells with your own flesh and blood. Each time you cast a spell, you lose 1 lb per spell level. Once your weight dips below 1.5 lbs/inch, you begin to weaken, losing 3 points of CON per 10 lbs thereafter. If you become undead, this effect is removed. |
| 19 | The chaotic energies released by your spells take a terrible toll on your body. Each time you cast a spell, you age 1 year per spell level. If you become undead, this effect is removed. |
| 20 | Casting spells sends harmful negative energy coursing through your body. Each time you cast a spell, you suffer 1 point of damage per spell level. If you become undead, this effect is removed. |

| **Unexpected Abilities** | |
| **Roll** | **Special Ability** |
| 1 | **Magic Resistance\*:** The creature gains magic resistance with a target value of (20-HD). |
| 2 | **Enslave\*:** The creature can enslave victims to its will 3/day by gaze. The target must make a Spells saving throw, and on a failure is totally enthralled by the creature. If the creature has 3 HD or less, the save is at +2. If the creature has 9 HD or more, the save is at -2. |
| 3 | Invisibility\*: The creature is naturally **invisible**. It may act freely, including attacking, without becoming visible. |
| 4 | **Breath Weapon\*:** The creature gains a dragon-like breath weapon usable 3/day. The breath weapon deals 1d6 damage per HD of the creature, with a Blast saving throw reducing damage by half. 1 – flame (fire); 2 – lightning (electric); 3 – freezing vapors (cold); 4 – poison vapor (poisonous); 5 – sonic blast (seismic); 6 – blistering corrosive (acidic); 7 – magical force (arcane); 8 – fetid gas (necrotic). Area of effect and special properties are as per a dragon. |
| 5 | **Flying####:** The creature is capable of flying at an exploration speed of 10’ per HD. If it already flies, it becomes capable of making dive attacks that deal double damage. If a dive hits a victim smaller than itself, it grabs and carries him off, unless the victim makes a successful Paralysis saving throw. If it already has a dive attack, re-roll. |
| 6 | **Poison\*:** Victims of the creature’s primary attack(s) must make a successful Death saving throw or be poisoned. Roll 1d20 to determine onset time: 1-12, instant (at the end of the creature’s initiative); 13-14, 1 turn; 15, 1d4 turns; 16-19 1d4+2 turns; 20, 1 d10 turns. Roll 1d20 to determine effect 1-16, death; 17-19: paralysis 2d4 turns + 1d6 damage per HD; 20: incapacitation. If the creature has 3 HD or less, the save is at +2. If the creature has 9 HD or more, the save is at -2. |
| 7 | **Immunity**: The creature gains an immunity. Roll 1d12: 1 – all mundane damage \*, 2 – all extraordinary damage \*, 3 – all physical damage\*, 4 – all energy damage\*, 5 – any 6 damage types \*, 6 – Any 3 damage types ####, 7 – Any mundane physical damage ####, 8 – any 3 mundane damage types ##, 9 – all enchantment effects ####, 10 – all death effects ####, 11 – all transmogrification effects ####, 12 roll 1d8+4 twice. Re-roll if the creature is already immune to the effect. |
| 8 | **Swallow Attack\*:** The creature can swallow whole victims two size categories smaller than itself on an unmodified attack throw of 20. A victim that is swallowed whole takes damage equal to the creature’s most damaging attack each round until the creature is killed or the victim dies. If the creature is gigantic size, it can swallow on 19-20; if colossal size, on 18-20. If the creature is not at least large, re-roll. |
| 9 | **Ongoing Damage\*:** Once the creature has hit its victim, has hit its victim, it can use its combat action to automatically deal ongoing damage each round equal to its most damaging attack. Special effects (enervation, poison, etc.) are not ongoing. |
| 10 | **Bonus Attack (##):** The monster gains one or more bonus attacks. Roll 1d6: 1 – 3 one bonus attack dealing damage equal to its primary attack, 4 – 6 two bonus attacks each dealing damage equal to its secondary attack (or half its primary attack). If the bonus attack increases the monster’s average damage to more than 4 points per HD, it counts as a special ability (\*) for XP purposes. Otherwise it is two minor abilities (##). |
| 11 | **Senses (#):** The creature gains a superior sense. Roll 1d10: 1 acute vision, 2 acute hearing, 3 acute olfaction, 4 echolocation 120’, 5 mechanoreception (air), 6 mechanoreception (ground), 3-6 lightless vision 60’.

| 13 | **Grab/Restrain**\*: The creature gains the ability to grab or restrain its targets. Roll 1d20: 1-14, it gains a constriction attack that deals damage equal to its primary attack and restrains any creature struck that is smaller than itself; 15-17, If it hits a creature smaller than itself with at least two of its secondary attacks, the creature struck must make a successful Paralysis saving throw or be grabbed; 18-20, if it hits a creature smaller than itself with its primary attack, the creature struck must make a successful Paralysis saving throw or be grabbed. |
| 14 | **Aura\*:** The creature is surrounded by a damaging aura that deals damage to susceptible creatures each round. The aura has a radius of 1’ per HD (min 5’), and deals 1d8 damage per round. Roll 1d8 for the type of aura: 1 – arcane; 2 – acidic; 3 – cold; 4 – electric; 5 – fire; 6 – necrotic; 7 – poisonous; 8 – seismic. |
| 15 | **Paralysis:** Victims of the monster’s primary attack(s) must make a successful Paralysis saving throw or be paralyzed. Roll 1d6: 1 – 2 paralysis lasts for 1d10 rounds, 3 – 6 paralysis lasts for 2d4 turns. |
| 16 | **Massive Size:** The creature’s size is increased by one category. Its HD are doubled. Its damage from physical attacks is doubled. |
| 17 | **Acid\*:** The creature’s attacks destroy non-magical armor or clothing on a successful hit. A non-magical weapon that strikes the creature dissolves immediately after dealing damage. Magical weapons and armor are allowed a Death saving throw using the wearer’s throw, adding any magical bonus to the roll if applicable. |
| 18 | **Petrification\*:** Any victim that either (1 – 3) meets the creature’s gaze or (4 – 6) is struck by the creature’s attack(s) is required to make a Paralysis saving throw or be turned to stone. |
| 19 | **Enervation\*\*:** Victims of the creature’s primary attack reduce their maximum hp by the damage dealt and cause the target to become **enervated**. |
| 20 | **Spell-like Abilities:** The creature gains 1d4 spell-like abilities, each usable 1/day. Generate the abilities as if rolling for spell scrolls or select appropriate abilities based on the creature’s other powers (Judge’s choice). |

When rolling on the Unexpected Abilities table, re-roll any results that duplicate abilities the creature already possesses except where otherwise noted. At the Judge’s discretion, particular special abilities may be chosen based on existing powers, or adjusted to match earlier results. For example, if the first ability a creature gains is a lightning aura, and a later roll indicates an immunity, it would make sense for the immunity to be versus lightning. All results are cumulative.

## Congregants and Divine Power

Divine spellcasters such as crusaders, bladedancers, and craftpriests, can draw on the **divine power** of their deity to aid them. Divine power is measured in **gp value equivalent** and has a number of uses.

### Congregations

Lawful divine spellcasters earn divine power drawn by building congregations of faithful worshippers. Every fifty congregants earns the caster 10gp worth of divine power per week of faithful worship.

To qualify as congregants, characters must be of the same alignment as the divine spellcaster, worship his deity, and consider the divine spellcaster to be their spiritual advisor. A divine spellcaster’s party members, henchmen and followers can (and should) form the core of his congregants.

Divine spellcasters can recruit congregants by performing charitable deeds, sending out missionaries, and constructing temples. Each month, calculate the value of the spellcaster’s proselytizing:

* The gp value of all spells charitably cast on behalf of peasants by the spellcaster or his henchmen or followers (using the costs for spells from the Spell Availability by Markettable in the **Hirelings**, **Henchmen**, **Mercenaries**, **and Specialists** section);
* The gp value of any hirelings deployed as missionaries in the realm by the spellcaster; and
* The gp value of any religious structures erected in the realm by the spellcaster that month.

For every full 1,000gp value of proselytizing in the month, the divine spellcaster gains a number of congregants equal to 1d10 + CHA bonus. The divine spellcaster cannot acquire more congregants than exist in the realm that he is proselytizing within.

EXAMPLE: Balbus, a 4th level crusader, seeks congregants in the village he and his party are based in. He erects a wooden chapel to Ammonar costing 700gp, and spends a week casting spells for the peasants. As a 4th level crusader, he can cast 2 1st level spells (each worth 5gp) and 2 2nd level spells (worth 20gp) each day. Over the course of a week, Balbus casts 350gp worth of spells for the peasants. The gp value of his proselytizing is 1,050gp, so he gains a number of congregants equal to a roll of 1d10 + CHA bonus.

Once acquired, the divine caster must maintain the congregation or they will begin to lose faith. Maintaining a congregation requires one day of dedicated activity each week. If the caster does not undertake this dedicated activity, the divine spellcaster loses 1d10! congregants per 1,000. This represents counter-missionary work, abandonment of faith, or other spiritual challenges.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Domain Worship** | |
| **Domain**  **Morale** | **Divine Power**  **per 10 Families**  **per Week** |
| -4 | 0 |
| -3 | 1 |
| -2 | 2 |
| -1 | 3 |
| 0 | 4 |
| +1 | 5 |
| +2 | 6 |
| +3 | 7 |
| +4 | 8 |

More powerful divine spellcasters can amass congregants by assuming rulership of a domain, or becoming the chaplain of a domain ruler. A ruler can simply command his subjects to worship his god, creating vast multitudes of worshippers within his domain. Of course, not every subject in a domain will faithfully worship on command — the domain’s morale will make a large difference. The Domain Worship table lists the value of spiritual essence a ruler or his chaplain can extract from the peasant families in his domain. This amount is always less than the full 10gp per fifty congregants, as no domain will be 100% faithful to the character’s god.

EXAMPLE: Balbus, now a 9th level Crusader, rules Ammantavus, a domain of 2,500 peasant families (12,500 people) with a domain morale score of 0. Each week, Balbus gains 4gp worth of spiritual essence per 10 families (50 people), or 1,000gp value total, from his domain. If Balbus’s subjects were more loyal to him, he could gain much more spiritual essence from his domain.

A ruler who asks his subjects to worship a god or religion foreign to them will suffer large penalties to domain morale. Rulers will often address this by throwing festivals in the new faith or taking other steps to increase domain morale.

Sometimes a divine spellcaster might have congregants from proselytization that are also residents in the domain he presides over; For instance, he might have been proselytizing in a domain, and then become ruler or chaplain of that domain. In that case, the caster gets 10gp per 10 families (50 congregants) in his personal congregation, and then a variable gp per family from the remaining families based on the domain morale.

### Blood Sacrifice

While chaotic divine spellcasters can earn divine power from gaining congregants, a darker path is also available to them: Blood sacrifice of living creatures to their deity.

Conducting a blood sacrifice must be performed in a chaotic temple, graveyard, or other sinkhole of evil. The sacrificial victim(s) must be **helpless** (if Lawful or Neutral) orwilling (if Chaotic). Sacrificing unwilling chaotic creatures provides no divine power, as the dark gods see little merit in the slaughter of their own worshippers. The sacrifice of a willing chaotic creature does earn divine power, however, as it offers a means for chaotic spellcasters to demonstrate their power and faith.

Each blood sacrifice takes one turn. At the completion of the sacrifice, the spellcaster earns divine power equal to the value of the creature’s components. Usually this value is equal to its XP value, but not always. For instance, most ordinary animals provide no divine power and some great-souled creatures provide ten times as much! See ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual***for details.

After receiving this divine power, the spellcaster then makes a magic research throw. If the throw fails, there is no further effect. If it succeeds, the spellcaster gains additional divine power, as a reward from his dark gods. The additional power gained is based on the characteristics of the victim:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Victim Characteristic | Multiplier |
| Victim is virgin | + Component Value |
| Victim is divine caster of opposite alignment/faith | + Component Value x 2 |
| Victim is noble (ruler or heir of barony to duchy) | + Component Value x 3 |
| Victim is royal (ruler or heir of principality, kingdom, or empire) | + Component Value x 5 |
| Victim is parent, mature descendant, or beloved of sacrificier | + Component Value x 10 |

EXAMPLE: Mentu the Death Priest, a 12th level chaotic crusader, is sacrificing Balbus to his patron deity, Dirgion the Doombringer. Balbus is a 14th level crusader worth 2,700 XP. Balbus is also the ruler of a principality and is a crusader of Dirgion’s hated rival, Ammonar. Therefore, If Mentu succeeds on his magical research throw of 5+, he will earn divine power totaling (2,700) + (2,700 x 2) + (2,700 x 5) = 21,600.

Unfortunately, Mentu rolls a 2. He gains a mere 2,700 divine power as the crusader’s spirit escapes to a holier place. In a rage, Mentu sacrifices the ogres who had captured the crusader. As these are unwilling chaotic sacrifices, he gains no value from doing so (apart from sating his blood lust!).

**Designer’s Note:** In the Auran Empire setting, animal sacrifices to the Empyrean gods do not generate divine power for the spellcaster, because the divine power is sent to the deity in an act of devotion. In other campaign settings, however, Lawful or Neutral divine spellcasters might be permitted to conduct blood sacrifice of non-sapient animals such as bulls, horses, etc. Since ordinary animals do not provide any divine power, only exceptional specimens could be used in such sacrifices. Lawful or Neutral spellcasters can never benefit from the blood sacrifice of sapient creatures.

### Using Divine Power

Divine power is granted to casters so that they can advance the agenda of the power they serve. It must be spent within one month of being received and cannot be stored. If not spent within one month of its accumulation, it fades away, the spiritual energies returning to the caster’s deity.

###### Consecrating Altar

A divine caster can use divine power to consecrate an altar. Consecrating an altar is an ongoing dedicated activity lasting one day per 500gp of altar value and requires an expenditure of divine power equal to the value of the altar. An altar consecrated to the Chaotic powers creates a sinkhole of evil, while an altar consecrated to the Lawful powers creates a pinnacle of good. The size of the sinkhole or pinnacle around the altar will be 100 square feet per 100gp spent on the altar. If a humbler-looking altar is desired, divine power can be spent in lieu of gp. Once consecrated, an altar retains its aura until the aura is **dispelled**or the altar is physically broken and *blessed*.

###### Consecrating Fields

A divine caster can use divine power to consecrate a domain’s fields. Consecrating fields is an ongoing dedicated activity requiring 1 day per 780 peasant families (rounded up). Upon completing the consecration, the spellcaster must expend 2gp of divine power per family and make a magic research throw. If the throw succeeds, the fields have been consecrated. Consecration increases the Land Value by 1gp during the next month’s Revenue Collection phase. If the throw is an unmodified 1, the consecration goes awry, and the Land Value is decreased by 1gp during the next month’s Revenue Collection phase. Fields may be consecrated repeatedly if sufficient divine power is available, and legends tell of garden-like realms blessed by the gods.

###### Consecrating Ruler

A divine caster of 9th level or higher who is the chaplain of a domain ruler can invest the ruler with sacred authority. Consecrating a ruler is a dedicated activity for one day, but it cannot be performed more than once per year. Upon completing the consecration, the spellcaster must expend divine power equal to the ruler’s monthly domain revenue, and make a magic research throw. If the throw succeeds, the ruler has been consecrated. For the next 12 game months, the consecrated ruler increases his domain’s base morale score by 1 point and gain a +1 bonus on all loyalty rolls by vassals. When generating random vagaries while the ruler is consecrated, the Judge will roll twice and select the vagary that is more favorable to the ruler (vagaries are detailed in the ***ACKS II Judges Journal***). However, if the throw is an unmodified 1, the consecration goes awry. The ruler decreases his domain’s base morale score by 1 point, imposes a -1 penalty to all loyalty rolls by vassals, and suffers the worse of two vagary rolls. At the Judge’s discretion, the magic research throw can be modified by the ruler’s behavior in the past 12 months, and awry results might occur in an increased range (an unmodified 1 – 3) for exceptionally impious rulers.

###### Magic Research

A divine caster who is engaged in magic research can use divine powerto pay for some or all of the component cost and/or material cost of the research. The research must be in furtherance of the goals of the divine spellcaster’s patron deity. Some magic research projects might require special components that cannot be replaced by divine power (Judge’s discretion).

###### Praying and Sacrificing

A divine caster can return divine power to his god through prayer and sacrifice. Prayer and sacrifice requires one day of dedicated activity. The gp value of divine power returned to the deity each month grants campaign XP to the extent it exceeds the spellcaster’s GP threshold.

## Earning Experience from Campaigns

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Monthly XP Threshold** | |
| **Class Level** | **XP Threshold** |
| **1** | 25 |
| **2** | 75 |
| **3** | 150 |
| **4** | 300 |
| **5** | 600 |
| **6** | 1,200 |
| **7** | 2,400 |
| **8** | 5,000 |
| **9** | 10,000 |
| **10** | 20,000 |
| **11** | 45,000 |
| **12** | 75,000 |
| **13** | 150,000 |
| **14** | 425,000 |

Characters that undertake campaign activities can earn experience points (XP) from the income (or income equivalent) of their activities, just as they earn XP for gold recovered on adventurers. However, in most cases, the amount of experienced earned from campaign activities is reduced each month by the character’s **monthly XP threshold**. The XP threshold is based on the character’s level, and is based on the monthly income that a character of that stature should be able to earn with little risk or effort.

### Experience from Construction

A character receives 1 XP per 2gp spent constructing a stronghold (castle, sanctum, etc.) used to secure a domain. A stronghold constructed by a henchman earns the henchman 1 XP per 4gp (i.e. 50% of the normal award). The XP is earned when the stronghold is completed.

Assassins, nightblades, thieves, and venturers do not get XP from gp spent to construct a hideout or guildhouse. Casters do not gain XP from gp spent to construct dungeons, but do gain XP for harvesting monsters in them.

Unlike all other types of campaign XP, experience from construction is not reduced by the character’s monthly XP threshold. However, if the character ever loses the stronghold, the character loses the XP earned from its construction. This may result in the loss of class levels. The character can regain the lost XP by re-taking the stronghold intact. If the stronghold is partially destroyed when re-captured, the character re-gains XP equal to its reduced value.

### Experience from Domains

A character can earn XP from his **domain income**. Domain income is the total of the ruler’s land, service, tax, trade, and tribute revenue, less his garrison, liturgy, maintenance, tithe, tribute, and upkeep expenses. If domain income exceeds the character’s XP threshold, he earns XP equal to the difference. Domain income is earned monthly. Magistrates treat their salary as domain income (p. XX) for XP purposes.

EXAMPLE: Marcus is a 9th level fighter who has become king of a newly-independent Borderlands. His domain of 1,500 families generates 9,000gp of land income, 6,000gp of service income, and 2,000gp of tax income. His 5 vassals pay him an additional 8,000gp each month in tribute, making his domain revenue 25,000gp. However, his garrison costs 4,500gp; liturgies costs 1,500gp; maintenance costs 1,500gp, tithes cost 1,500gp each month, making his domain expenses 9,000gp. His domain income is therefore (25,000gp – 9,000gp) = 16,000gp per month. Since he is 9th level, Marcus has an XP threshold of 10,000. Therefore he earns (16,000 – 10,000) = 6,000 XP per month. If he were a henchman, he’d earn half that, or 3,000 XP.

If he rules his domain for long enough, the 6,000 XP per month will eventually bring Marcus to 10th level. At that point, his XP threshold will become 20,000. He will thereafter no longer earn XP from his domain unless and until he raises his domain income. Rulers in ***ACKS***who end up with domain income larger than their XP threshold must be ambitious and ruthless!

### Experience from Hijinks

A syndicate boss can earn XP from his monthly hijink income. Monthly hijink income is the total gp value earned from hijinks by the boss, less the cost of wages, attorneys, bribes, fines, and magical healing for his members. (Income can be rolled and calculated manually, or the Monthly Hijink Income table in the **Managing Criminal Guilds** section can be used for to calculate a fixed income, or a combination of both.) If monthly hijink income exceeds the character’s XP threshold, he earns XP equal to the difference.

Syndicate members earn XP equal to 50% of the gp value of hijinks they perpetrate successfully.

A, 1st level syndicate member will earn an average of 50 XP per month from hijinks. Assuming that the boss manages to bail them out of trouble every time he gets caught, a 1st level member will reach 2nd level in about 25 months (two years). Most ruffians do not, in practice, live that long.

A 0th level syndicate member can also earn XP from perpetrating hijinks. However, in most cases, the only hijink available to 0th level characters is carousing (15% chance of success). If a 0th level character earns 500 XP from carousing, he will become a 1st level assassin, bard, nightblade, or thief. Which class will depend on his race but more importantly on the sort of company the character is keeping. On average, it takes 0th level characters about 28 months of consorting with unsavory sorts in dimly-lit taverns to advance to 1st level.

Remember that XP earned from hijinks performed by a crew is split pro rata by level among all the perpetrators who don’t get caught.

### Experience from Mercantile Income

A character or group of characters can earn XP from mercantile income. Mercantile income is the total of gp earned from arbitraging goods and transporting cargo and passengers, less the cost of goods sold, wages, rations, tolls, tariffs, moorage and stabling, and labor fees. (Note that the purchase price of unsold merchandise is not subtracted as a cost.) Mercantile income is calculated at the end of each month for the venture as a whole.

If mercantile income is positive, the venture has earned a profit. When a venture earns a profit, it is allocated for XP purposes as follows. 50% of the profit goes to the owner(s) of the venture’s assets (its funds, caravan, ships, and/or arbitrage cargo), while 50% of the profit goes to the operator(s) of the venture. If several characters co-own the assets, the profit split pro-rata by ownership share. If several characters operate the venture, the profit is split evenly among all surviving operators, including player characters, henchmen, and followers, with henchmen and followers receiving a half share each. Hired mercenaries or specialists do not receive a share of profit. If the share of profit received by a character exceeds his XP threshold, he earns campaign XP equal to the difference.

Income from passive investment does not grant campaign XP.

**Designer’s Note**: In the real world, entrepreneurs attempt to achieve cash flow without taxable profit. In the game world, your players will attempt to achieve XP without actual profit by, e.g. arranging for all expenses to fall in one month and all revenue to fall in another to therefore claim a huge profit that blows past their XP threshold. The mechanics above are intended to keep such “cheese” in check.

EXAMPLE: Caleför, Foggy, and Norden pool their wealth to launch a mercantile venture for a 500-mile run between Aura and Zidium. Caleför contributes 30,000gp while Foggy and Norden each contribute 10,000gp, for a total of 50,000gp. The funds are used to buy a large sailing ship (20,000gp) with 200 shp and 30,000 st of cargo capacity. The remainder is set aside for operations.

On Day 1 of Month 1, the party hires a captain, navigator, and 18 crew for a month of operations (252gp). Caleför spends 10 days soliciting merchandise for sale in Aura, ultimately purchasing 23,750gp worth of precious merchandise weighing 175 stone. Foggy and Norden solicit 50 passengers and 19,500 stone of cargo for a 500-mile journey. They then load the merchandise onto their vessel and depart. Overall they spent 13 days in the market, paying (200 shp / 50 shp x 1gp/day x 13 days) 52gp in moorage and (.05gp/day x 20 crew x 13 days) = 13gp for rations.

They spend seven days at sea. The cost of rations for the trip is (.05gp/day x [20 crew + 50 passengers] x 7 days) 24.5gp. They reach Zidium on Day 20, paying a toll of 60gp (0.2cp / stone x 30,000 st) and a tariff of (20% x 23,750gp) 4,750gp to enter. They collect 150gp from their passengers and 245gp from their shipping contract.

Caleför now spends ten days selling their precious merchandise for 29,700gp, while Foggy and Norden solicit for merchandise to purchase. They purchase 23,750gp worth of merchandise. During that time they pay (200 shp / 50 shp x 1gp/day x 10 days) = 40gp in moorage and (.05gp/day x 20 crew x 10 days) = 10gp for rations.

At the end of the month, their revenue was (150gp + 245gp + 29,700gp) = 30,095gp. Their expenses were 23,750gp in cost of goods; 4,750gp in tariffs; 252gp in wages; 92gp in moorage; 60gp in tolls; and 47.5gp in rations, for a total of 28,951gp. Their mercantile income was 1,144gp. Our intrepid adventurers have a return of 2.28% on their 50,000gp venture!

For XP purposes, 50% of the mercantile income is distributed based on ownership of the assets of the venture. Caleför owns 60%, so he gets 343.2gp, while Foggy and Norden get 114.4gp each. The other 50% is distributed equally between the three participants, so they each get 190.6gp. Caleför thus nets 534gp while Foggy and Norden each get 305gp for XP purposes. If this exceeds their GP threshold, they will earn campaign XP.

Note that even though the venture purchased more merchandise in Zidium, that 23,750gp purchase was not counted as an expense. The cost of those goods will not be counted until they are sold. Also note that over time the venture will actually be able to complete 3 trips every 60 days (13 days in market + 7 days at sea); the first voyage was less profitable on a per-day basis because the venture had nothing to sell while it was buying. Over long periods of time, making round trips, the venture will average about 1,570gp per month in profit, with a rate of return of about 3.77% per month.

What if the venture only handled passenger and cargo carriage? In this case, it would only take about three days to solicit passengers and cargo. Their ship would thus depart Aura on Day 4 after paying 12gp in moorage and 3gp in rations. It would spend seven days at sea, paying 24.5gp for rations. Arriving at Zidium on Day 10, the venture would pay a toll of 60gp, then collect 395gp for the passengers and cargo delivery.

The venture would then spend three days in Zidium (again paying 12gp in moorage and 3gp in rations) and seven days at sea (paying 24.5gp in rations), arriving at Aura on Day 20. Upon arrival, the venture would pay a toll of 60gp and collect 395gp for the carriage.

Finally, the venture would spend another three days in Aura (again paying 12gp in moorage and 3gp in rations), seven days at sea (paying 24.5gp in rations) and arrive at Zidium on day 30, paying 60gp in tolls and collecting 395gp in carriage.

The mercantile revenue would be (395gp + 395gp + 395gp) = 1,185gp. The mercantile expenses would be 252gp in wages; 180gp in moorage; 82.5gp in rations; and 36gp in moorage, for a total of 550gp. Mercantile income would be 1,185gp – 550gp = 635gp. Since there was no arbitrage trading, the capital required to establish the venture is only the cost of the ship (20,000gp) and a month’s expenses (550gp), so the rate of return would be 635gp / 20,550gp = 3% per month.

###### Selling Treasure to gain Campaign XP

Adventurers often recover merchandise on dungeon delves, wilderness expeditions. This merchandise earns them adventuring XP equal to its base price when they return it to civilization (p. XX). This raises an interesting question: If the adventurers later sell that merchandise into the market, do they also get campaign XP from mercantile income? The answer is yes, but they must treat the base price (which they already earned as XP) as the cost of goods for purposes of campaign XP. This rule also applies to adventurers who seek to earn campaign XP from selling, e.g., gifts received from NPCs, objects made by genies, etc.

EXAMPLE: Caleför discovers 4 stones of ivory on an expedition into the Ivory Kingdoms. Ivory has a base price of 100gp per stone, so when he brings the ivory back to civilization he earns 400 XP from adventuring. He then transports the ivory to Aura, where he sells it on the market for a price of 150gp per stone, 600gp total. He treats his cost of goods as 100gp per stone, 400gp total, so he earns campaign XP on a mercantile income of (600 – 400) = 200gp. Had he sold the ivory for 100gp per stone or less, he’d not have been able to get any campaign XP at all.

### Experience from Magical Research

A character can earn XP from undertaking magical research. At the end of each month, calculate the total gp value of research that the character contributed towards magical research projects. If the amount exceeds his XP threshold, the character earns campaign XP equal to the difference. The character does not need to have completed the research to collect the XP. He still gains XP for research invested even if he fails a required magic research throw.

EXAMPLE: Elaria is a 9th level mage with a research rate of 600gp per day and an XP threshold of 10,000gp. At the start of the month, she begins work on a **sword +3** (research cost of 35,000gp). Each day, Elaria contributes 600gp value towards the research cost of the **sword +3**. After 30 days of research, she has contributed 18,000gp towards the research cost. She gains (18,000 – 10,000) = 8,000 XP for her month of research. Note that she still has 28.33 days of research left to complete the **sword +3**.

Note that because the materials cost must be paid at the start of a project, while the component cost is paid at the end of a project, a researcher could in theory gain experience from creating magic items without ever paying the component cost to actually create the magic items! In effect, he is “practicing” at magic item creation. Since material costs are very high, and nothing is produced by the work, this would be quite an expensive way to learn.

**Assistants:** An assistant aiding or working semi-independently gains 50% of the magical research XP he would earn if he conducted the research without supervision. Characters do not receive XP for magical research conducted by their assistants.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Breakthrough Achieved** | **XP Bonus** |
| Minor Breakthrough | 1/2 x Research Cost |
| Major Breakthrough | Research Cost |
| Revolutionary Breakthrough | 2 x Research Cost |

**Experimentation:** A researcher who increases his research rate by hasty experimentation contributes research value more quickly, which can help him exceed his gp threshold and thus advance in level faster. A researcher who achieves a breakthrough gains bonus XP. The bonus is one-half of the research cost of the project for a minor breakthrough; the research cost for a major breakthrough; and double the research cost for a revolutionary breakthrough.

**Pro-Rata GP Threshold (Optional Rule):** In some campaigns, the Judge may limit or discourage long periods of downtime. This can make it difficult for spellcasters to ever gain XP from magic research because they won’t work enough days per month to exceed their GP threshold. As an optional rule, the Judge can divide the character’s XP threshold by 30 and treat it as a daily XP threshold applied to each day’s research rate.

### Experience from Divine Power

A divine caster can earn XP from prayer and sacrifice that returns divine power to his deity. At the end of each month, calculate the total gp value of divine power that the caster returned to his deity. If the amount exceeds his XP threshold, the character earns campaign XP equal to the difference.

### 0th Level Characters and Experience from Campaigns

A 0th level character can earn experience points from campaign activities. If the 0th level character earns 500 XP from campaign activities, he can advance to become a 1st level character. (Some 0th level characters might need more or less XP to advance, as detailed in the ***Judges Journal***.)

**Magical Research:** A 0th level apprentice who studies under a studious spellcaster of 9th level or higher can become 1st level casters of the same class (i.e. mage or witch). The apprentice must first undertake a year of dedicated study. (The assumption is that they study at 6 days per week for 50 weeks, with a research rate of 2.5gp per day to yield the equivalent of 750 XP). He then must make a research throw of 18+ (modified by INT). If the throw succeeds, the apprentice advances to 1st level. If the throw fails on an unmodified 1 – 3, the apprentice becomes discouraged by his inaptitude for magic and leaves the mage’s service. On any other result, the apprentice fails to advance in level but continues his studies.

**Domain and Mercantile Income:** A 0th level character can earn XP from domain and mercantile income. They are treated as if they had an XP Threshold of 25gp. The character will advance into a type of class appropriate to way the XP was earned. For instance, a petty noble’s son (0th level character) who inherits his father’s small domain (125gp per month) will earn 100 XP per month (125gp – 25gp), advancing to become a 1st level fighter after 5 months as serving as baron (if bandits don’t kill him first).

**Hijinks:** A 0th level character can earn XP from perpetrating hijinks (usually carousing or racketeering). When the 0th level character earns 500 XP from hijinks, he can become a 1st level assassin, nightblade, or thief. Which class will depend on his race (only elves may be nightblades) and the sort of company the character is keeping. On average, it takes 0th level characters several years of consorting with unsavory sorts in dimly-lit taverns to advance to become a “real” thief.

When a 0th level character advances to 1st level, he gains the Adventuring proficiency and the attack throws, saving throws, class powers, and proficiencies of his new class. The character re-rolls his hit points using his new class’s Hit Die, keeping either his new hp total or his prior hp total +1 if it was higher.

The new 1st level character retains any proficiencies he already knew. If these proficiencies are equivalent to any of the class powers of his new class, they are replaced by the newly-gained class powers. If the proficiencies are not part of his class powers, they count against his limit of proficiencies from level, INT and/or time and training (p. XX). If he has more general proficiencies than permitted by level, INT, and time and training, he loses one proficiency each month of game time, representing the erosion of his old professional skills over time. If he has more class proficiencies than permitted, or class proficiencies not permitted to his class at all, he loses them when he advances to 1st level.

# Chapter 9: Armies

Adventurers can hire troops at any time, but it is only when they become **leaders** of **domains** and **realms** that they truly become able to wage war and fight pitched battles. To do so, a leader must raise an **army**.Armies are organized into one or more **divisions**, eachled by **commanders.** Each division has one or more **units** of troops.

## Army Troops

The troops in an army can be drawn from five sources: **mercenaries**, **conscripts**, **militias**, **followers**,and **vassal troops**.

### Mercenaries

**Mercenaries** are hired soldiers that will guard, patrol, and campaign for anyone who pays their fee. Unlike conscripts and militias, which are levied involuntarily, mercenaries must be found and recruited to serve in an army.

###### Availability of Mercenaries in Markets

All characters can hire small numbers of mercenaries from markets to serve in their armies (p. XX). The availability of mercenaries will depend on the market class within which they are recruited, as noted on the Hireling Availability by Market Class table (p. XX). Mercenaries will be of the prevailing race of the settlement they are recruited from (usually human). Dwarven and elven troops may only be found in dwarven and elven settlements. Beastmen troops may only be found in Chaotic-aligned settlements. Certain troops can only be found when the realm lies within particular types of climates, or consists of particular types of terrain. For instance, camel archers are only available in desert realms.

###### Availability of Mercenaries from the Realm

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Realm**  **Size** | **Cost Per Time Period**  **Per Mercenary Type** |
| Continent | 6d10 x 1,000gp |
| Empire | 2d6+1 x 1,000gp |
| Kingdom | 4d12 x 100gp |
| Principality | 5d6 x 100gp |
| Duchy | 4d20 x 10gp |
| County | 4d10 x 10gp |
| Viscounty | 2d4 x 10gp |
| Barony | 2d6+1gp |

A domain or realm leader, or a character acting with the permission of the leader, can recruit mercenaries from throughout his entire realm to serve in his army. Doing so takes longer than recruiting from markets but yields many more troops. The Mercenary Availability by Realm Size table shows how many of each type of mercenary is available in each size of realm and what time period is required to recruit them. Only one character can recruit mercenaries in any one domain or realm at a time. Availability restrictions by race, climate, and terrain are identical to those from settlements (above). Note that the listed realms are of minimum population for their type; if the realm is larger than the listed population, scale up proportionately.

One half of the realm’s crop of mercenaries (rounded up) become available within the first time period after the leaders begin mustering troops. Another quarter (rounded down, minimum 1) become available during the second time period. The remainder of the crop becomes available in the third period. The crop of mercenaries available in the realm replenishes at the end of the fourth time period. (Replenishment represents younger sons deciding to become warriors, veterans leaving military life to become sellswords, foreign mercenaries being attracted by the opportunities for gold, etc.)

EXAMPLE: The Tarkaun of Aura, an empire with a population of 5,600,000 families, wants to hire all the heavy infantry mercenaries in his realm. A total crop of (5,600,000 / 1,500,000 x 13,000) 48,000 heavy infantry can be hired. He begins mustering mercenaries in the spring of the Year 381. In the first season (spring), a crop of 24,000 heavy infantry are available. In the second season (summer), a crop of 12,000 more heavy infantry become available. In the third season (fall), another crop of 12,000 heavy infantry become available. At the end of the fourth season (winter), the crop of heavy infantry available replenishes to 48,000.

As with finding and hiring mercenaries in markets, there is a gp cost associated with finding and hiring mercenaries in a realm. Each time period that the adventurer is recruiting mercenaries in his domain or realm, he must pay the fee listed on the adjoining table. This fee is per type of mercenary.

###### Availability of Military Specialists in the Realm

A domain or realm leaders (or representative thereof) can also recruit military specialists from throughout the domain or realm to serve in their armies. The Military Specialist Availability by Realm Size table shows how many of each type of specialist is available in each size of realm and how long they take to arrive. As with mercenaries, the listed realms are of minimum population for their type and can be scaled up for larger realms. The specialists arrive at the same rate as mercenaries, and as with finding and hiring mercenaries in a realm, there is a gp cost associated with finding and hiring specialists throughout the realm. The fee is identical to that for recruiting mercenaries.

###### Hiring Mercenaries and Specialists

Just because mercenaries and specialists are available does not mean they will automatically serve the character. Mercenaries must be recruited through negotiation, as per the rules in **Recruiting Hirelings**(p. XX). However, leaders raising armies generally hire large numbers of mercenaries and specialists at once, making it far too time-consuming to recruit them individually. The Judge will divide the mercenaries into formations of companies (120), battalions (500), or brigades (2,000) for purposes of rolls on the Reaction to Hiring Offer table. The Judge might assign some specialists to particular mercenary units.

EXAMPLE: The Tarkaun of Aura is attempting to recruit 24,000 heavy infantry mercenaries. The Judge divides these into 12 brigades of 2,000 mercenaries each. The Tarkaun rolls 12 times on the Reaction to Hiring Offer table. 11 of the heavy infantry brigades accept his offer, meaning he has recruited 22,000 mercenaries.

After they are hired, mercenaries must be paid the monthly wages listed on the Mercenary Gp Wage per Monthtable, below. Note that troops with alternative arms and armor or experience might have a better or worse wage. See the **Troop Characteristic Summaries** (p. XX)for examples.

If a realm’s entire crop of mercenaries of a particular type is hired, multiple leaders attempt to recruit mercenaries at the same time, or background events in the campaign cause mercenaries to be in demand, the wages that mercenaries demand might increase (Judge’s discretion).

###### Mercenary Morale and Loyalty

Like all hirelings, an army’s mercenaries and specialists have **morale scores** and **loyalty scores.** Morale score is the mercenary’s confidence in battle. Mercenary morale is based on their training and equipment, as shown on the table below. Morale rolls (but not the base score) are modified by the commander’s **morale modifier** (p. XX) when he leads them in battle. Loyalty is the mercenary’s fidelity to his employer. Mercenary officers have a base loyalty score of -2. Mercenary troops and other types of specialists have a loyalty score of 0. Loyalty scores are permanently modified by the leader’s Charisma modifier.

The same rules for morale and loyalty apply as they do to hirelings retained by adventurers (p. xx), except as noted hereafter. When fielding armies, morale rolls and loyalty scores are tracked and rolled on a unit-by-unit base for events that occur to the unit.

Morale rolls for units are made during battles when casualties exceed an army’s break point (p. XX). Loyalty rolls for units are made any time the unit suffers a **calamity**. A calamity includes routing from a battle, suffering 25% or greater casualties, being out of supply for a week, or going without pay for a month. If the troops are suffering from more than one calamity at once, there is a -2 penalty on the die roll per calamity after the first.

The effect of loyalty rolls on units are slightly different than their effect on individuals. Refer to the Unit Loyalty table. **Hostility** means that the unit as a whole considers their former employer to be an enemy. The troops will immediately leave his service. If their erstwhile leader is personally vulnerable, the mercenaries might attack him or stage a coup. If the character is opposed by a strong enemy, they will seek employment with the enemy leader.

| Roll whenever a calamity occurs (routing from a battle, 25% or greater casualties, loss of supply, no pay for a month) | |

**Resignation** means that the unit has decided to leave the leader’s service. If possible they will resign at an advantageous moment, such as right after being paid or reaching a safe stronghold, but in no circumstances will they risk a further battle or calamity.

**Grudging Loyalty** means the unit is reluctant to continue in the leader’s service, but sees no better options. If a result of grudging loyalty is rolled on two consecutive morale rolls, the mercenaries will leave the character’s service.

**Loyalty** means that the mercenaries will continue in the character’s service with enthusiasm. **Fanatic Loyalty** means the mercenaries have become dedicated and sworn servants of the character. All future loyalty rolls will be at +1. Fanatic Loyalty can never result from going without pay — treat such results as Loyalty.

###### Mercenary Veterans

Most mercenary units try to avoid actual warfare, preferring to be deployed to patrols, garrisons, and punitive expeditions against peasants. After all, real fighting leads to real dying, and dead mercenaries collect no wages! As a result, the average human mercenary is a 0th level normal man (1-1 HD, attack throw 11+, damage by weapon).

Mercenary units with experience of real war are known as **veterans**. Veterans will generally be 1st level fighters or explorers. They will have morale scores 1 point higher than the base morale for their troop type. If recruited into a leader’s army, veterans must be paid a higher wage because of their scarcity and prowess. Up to 25% of human mercenaries hired (e.g. 100 out of every 400) may be veterans.

**Designer’s Note:** Veterans make up 25% of a human army. Owing to their longer life spans, demi-humans have twice as many leveled characters as humans, but their mercenaries cost around twice as much. Thus, for every given domain size, demi-humans armies will have half as many troops as a human army, but all of those troops will be veterans. Dwarven and elven militia are the equivalent of human regulars. Higher-level dwarven, elven, and human troops are assumed to be in positions of command, support, and so on.

### Conscripts

The leader of a domain can permanently **conscript** peasants into his army. Up to 1 conscript per 10 peasant families can be levied without impacting domain morale or domain revenue. This conscription can be done all at once, or over a period of time. If the number of peasant families changes, the available number of conscripts likewise changes — a reduction in population means that some conscripts will have to be released from service, while an increase in population allows for increased conscription. If conscripts are killed, they can only be replaced through population growth, so leaders should track conscript casualties.

EXAMPLE: When the campaign begins, Marcus’s domain has 1,000 families. He can conscript and maintain a standing army of 100 conscripts from his domain. Six months later, Marcus has lost 50 conscripts to battle, but his domain has grown to 1,200 families. He can recruit an additional 20 conscripts (from the 200 families that joined his domain), giving him 70 conscripts.

When recruited, conscripts will carry no weapons or armor, have 1d4 hit points each, have morale scores of -2, and fight as normal men. Unless trained, they can only be equipped with spears, clubs, quarterstaffs, or daggers. Conscripts must be paid wages of 3gp per month. Conscripts who are better equipped and trained must be paid more (see below).

When a leader levies conscripts, it will take time for them to become available for his use, based on the size of realm. One half the requested conscripts (rounded up) will arrive within the first time period after the leader begins conscription. Another quarter (rounded down, minimum 1) will arrive during the second time period. The remainder of the conscripts becomes available in the third period.

**Designer’s Note:** Most ***ACKS***campaigns only cover 3 to 5 years of action. In long term campaigns that encompass many years of gameplay, the Judge can optionally replace casualties by 5% of the recruitable amount each year. For instance, with 1,000 families Marcus could replenish (100 x .05) = 5 conscripts each year from the 50 he’d lost. After ten years, he’d have made good his losses.

###### Training Conscripts

Once levied, conscripts can be trained to become professional troops in the same varieties as exist for mercenaries (e.g. light infantry, horse archers, etc.). However, not every conscript can qualify to become every type of troop. Some lack any talent with animals, and cannot become cavalry; others are nearsighted and cannot become archers, for instance.

Any peasant able-bodied enough to be conscripted in the first place can be trained to be light infantry. 50% of conscripts have the fitness and discipline to be heavy infantry. 50% have the agility and vision to be slingers, bowmen or crossbowmen. Up to 25% have the skill and seat to be light cavalry and only two-thirds of those (17% of the total) to be medium cavalry. Longbowmen must be drawn from those with the qualities of both heavy infantry and bowmen, so only 25% of conscripts can qualify. Horse archers must be drawn from those capable of being both bowmen and cavalry, so only 12.5% can qualify. Heavy cavalry must be drawn from those capable of being both heavy infantry and medium cavalry, so only 8.5% can qualify. Cataphract cavalry must be drawn from those capable of being heavy infantry, bowmen, and medium cavalry, so only 5% can qualify.

Forces drawn from elven, dwarven, and humanoid racial stock follow similar rules at slightly different breakdowns. The Qualifying Number of Conscripts table summarizes these results, showing the number of each type of troop that can recruited from a pool of 120 conscripts. The Judge can create additional tables to create specialized nations or races. For instance, conscripts from a pseudo-Mongolian kingdom might all qualify as cavalry.

Training troops takes time, ranging from one month for light infantry to a full year for cataphract cavalry. During this time, the leader who levied the troops incurs costs for ammunition, training gear, **marshals** (p. XX), and so on. He must also provide equipment for the troops.

**Naval Conscripts:** Littoral domains can train conscripts to be sailors, rowers, or marines. Training sailors or rowers has the same time and gp cost as training light infantry. Training marines adds 1 month and 10gp in training cost to the marine’s mercenary type.

###### Conscript Morale

Like mercenaries, conscripts have morale scores representing their willingness to fight and loyalty scores measuring their fidelity to the leader. When first levied, conscripts have a base morale of -2 and loyalty of 0. After they are trained, conscripts have a base morale appropriate to their troop type.

Conscripts levied from domains with Steadfast or Stalwart domain morale gain a one-time +1 increase to their morale and loyalty scores. Conscripts levied from domains with Apathetic or Demoralized domain morale suffer a one-time -1 decrease to their morale and loyalty scores.

Conscripts make morale rolls during battles when casualties exceed their army’s break point, and loyalty rolls any time the conscripts suffer a calamity. (Remember, a calamity includes routing from a battle, suffering 25% or greater casualties, being out of supply, or going without pay for a month.)

When a loyalty roll is called for, use the Unit Loyalty table (p. XX). Since conscripts cannot voluntarily leave their leader’s service, hostility and resignation represent rebellion and desertion, respectively. If conscripts are released from service by their leader, trained conscripts will become mercenaries or brigands, while untrained conscripts will return to their farms.

### Militia

In addition to conscripting peasants, the leader of a domain can also levy a **peasant militia**. Up to 2 additional peasants per 10 families can be levied into the militia. For each peasant levied, domain revenues are reduced by one family, from loss of able-bodied manpower. Domain morale is also reduced by 1 point by levying 1 or fewer peasants per 10 families, and by 2 points by levying 2 peasants per 10 families. These penalties remain until the militia is sent home. If militia are killed, they can only be replaced through population growth, so leaders should track militia casualties. Militia arrive at the same rate as conscripts.

EXAMPLE: Marcus needs more troops than just 70 conscripts. He decides to call up 2 militia per 10 families, yielding him (1,200 / 10 x 2) 240 militia. Marcus’s domain will now produce revenue as if it has (1,200 – 240) 960 families, and his domain morale is reduced by 2 points. After a tough campaign season in which 80 militia are lost, the surviving 160 militia return home. This ends the domain morale penalty. However, if Marcus wants to call up his militia again, he now has only 160 to draw on, at least until his domain gains new families.

###### Training Militia

When recruited, militia have no weapons or armor, have only 1d4 hit points each, fight as normal men, and have -2 morale. Militia can be improved through training, like conscripts. (Littoral domains can train militia as marines, rowers, or sailors.) They must be paid wages of 3gp per month while called up (or more if they are trained).

If militia are trained and then sent home, they will take their equipment with them. When the militia are called up again, they will respond to the call with their equipment and be able to fight as the appropriate troop type. Trained militia will have the same characteristics as mercenaries of their type. They must be paid wages appropriate to their troop type when called up. The gold piece value of a trained and equipped militia can be applied against the garrison cost of a domain, even if the militia is not called up (p. XX)

EXAMPLE: Marcus has called up 240 militia prior to the outbreak of war, so that he can train them. 50% qualify to be trained as heavy infantry, which takes 1 month and 124gp each. The other 50% are trained as light infantry, taking 1 month and 94.5gp each. His total cost is [(120 x 124) + (120 x 94.5)] 26,220gp. (In addition he has lost out on the domain revenue he’d have gained during this time, as noted above). However, should Marcus go to war in the future, when he calls up his militia he has a fighting force of 120 light infantry and 120 heavy infantry, rather than just a poorly-armed peasant levy. In addition, he can apply their implicit wages of 2,160gp towards his garrison cost.

Once equipped, the members of a peasant militia are assumed to pass their arms and skills on to their heirs when they become no longer capable of serving. This assumption frees the Judge from tracking the age of each militia member and accounting for their deaths due to disease and so on.

Training and equipping a militia is a very expensive proposition. It also carries a risk. Should the domain’s morale ever become Turbulent, Defiant, or Rebellious (p. xxx), any rebels will be drawn from the militia. This means an unfortunate or uncharismatic leader might find himself fighting heavily armed, well trained forces rather than peasant rabble.

###### Militia Morale

Militia morale and loyalty scores are similar to those of conscripts. When first levied, militias have a base morale of -2. If trained, militias have a base morale appropriate to their troop type. Militias levied from domains with Steadfast or Stalwart domain morale gain a one-time +1 bonus to their morale and loyalty scores. Militias levied from domains with Apathetic or Demoralized domain morale suffer a one-time -1 penalty to their morale and loyalty scores.

Militia make morale rolls during battles when casualties exceed their army’s break point, and loyalty rolls any time the militia suffer a calamity. A calamity includes routing from a battle, suffering 25% or greater casualties, being out of supply, or going without pay for a month. In addition, militias also consider each full season of continuous campaigning to be a calamity.

When a loyalty roll is called for, use the Unit Loyalty table (p. XX). Like conscripts, militias cannot voluntarily leave their leader’s service, but may desert, betray, or attack the leader. If militia are voluntarily released from service by their leader, they will return to their farms.

### Clanhold Warriors

In sedentary agricultural civilizations, only a small fraction of the able-bodied men serve in the realms’ armies. In barbaric cultures, all able-bodied men (and some women) serve as **clanhold warriors**. The chief of a clanholdcan levy these clanhold warriors into his personal army. The chief of a realm of clanholds can use the “call to arms” favor to levy clanhold warriors from his vassals.

Up to 1 clanhold warrior per peasant family can be levied without impacting clanhold morale or revenue. The levy can be done all at once or over a period of time. If the number of peasant families changes, the available number of clanhold warriors likewise changes — a reduction in population means that some clanhold warriors will have to be released to return to their villages, while an increase in population means new warriors can be rallied to serve. If clanhold warriors are killed, they can only be replaced through population growth, so leaders should track clan warrior casualties.

When mustered, clanhold warriors arrive at the same rate as conscripts but are already trained and equipped as customary for their tribe. One-third of clanhold warriors levied are veterans instead of the usual one-fourth. While serving the chief, clanhold warriors do not have to be paid wages. However, they will expect spoils of war in order to continue service.

###### Clanhold Warrior Morale

Clanhold warriors have a base morale appropriate to their troop type. Clanhold warriors levied from clanholds with Steadfast or Stalwart domain morale gain a one-time +1 increase to their morale scores. Clanhold warriors levied from clanholds with Apathetic or Demoralized domain morale suffer a one-time -1 decrease to their morale scores. Clanhold warriors may have additional bonuses or penalties to morale based on working conditions, just as with mercenaries.

Clanhold warriors make morale rolls during battles when casualties exceed their army’s break point, and loyalty rolls any time the warriors suffer a calamity. Clanhold warriors also must make loyalty rolls each time they serve for three consecutive months without receiving spoils from a battle or siege at least equal to their wages.

When a loyalty roll is called for, use the Unit Loyalty table (p. XX). Clanhold warriors who leave their leader’s service will return to their clanhold if possible, but become brigands/mercenaries if not.

### Followers

The leader of a domain may have attracted followers that he can deploy into his army. The Followers Type and Equipment by Class table (p. XX) lists the arms and equipment of various types of followers.

###### Follower Morale

Like other types of troops, followers have a morale and loyalty score, which represents their willingness to fight and die for the leader. The loyalty score for followers is +2, or +4 for fanatical followers. Loyalty scores are permanently modified by the leader’s Charisma modifier. The morale score for followers is the same as for a mercenary of their type, or +4 for fanatical followers. Morale rolls (but not the base score) are modified by the commander’s **morale modifier** (p. XX

Followers make morale rolls during battles when casualties exceed their army’s break point, and loyalty rolls any time the followers suffer a calamity. When a loyalty roll is called for, use the Unit Loyalty table (p. XX). As with mercenaries, a calamity includes routing from a battle, suffering 25% or greater casualties, being out of supply, or going without pay for a month.

A crusader or bladedancer’s followers do not have to make loyalty rolls when suffering calamities, but still have to make morale rolls during battles. Other followers must make loyalty rolls when suffering calamities as usual.

### Vassal Troops

The leader of a realm does not have direct access to the mercenaries, conscripts, militias, or slave soldiers employed by his **vassals**. To access these troops, the leader of a realm must make a **call to arms** to his vassals. When a call to arms is issued, the vassal must muster a force at least equal to half the garrison of his realm. If desired, the leader can call for the vassal to send their full garrison, but doing so counts as demanding two duties and may provoke a Loyalty roll as described in **Favors and Duties** in Chapter 6 of ***ACKS***(p. 130). The Henchman Morale roll can be avoided by offering a boon of some sort to the vassal, as usual.

Note that when a leader makes a call to arms to a vassal, the vassal is required to muster forces based on the garrison of the vassal’srealm*,* not the vassal’s domain. The vassal will be expected to muster more than just the forces of his personal domain — it is the vassal’s responsibility in turn to issue calls to his own vassals. These sub-vassals may, in turn, call upon their own vassals for troops, and so on. In this way, the forces of an entire kingdom can be mobilized, one tier at a time.

Any particular domain’s garrison will be made up of some mix of followers, mercenaries, conscripts, and militia. The exact mix will be determined by the Judge or the player character who rules the domain.

###### Vassal Troops by Realm Size

The approximate value and number of troops available to realm leaders of various sizes is listed below on the Vassal Troops by Realm Size table. This table can be used to quickly determine the armies that can be fielded by realms of various sizes.

In most cases, a leader will not muster the maximum number of vassal troops, for several reasons. First, doing so would require him to either provoke a substantial number of Henchmen Morale rolls or offer a substantial number of gifts to vassals to avoid those rolls (see **Favors and Duties**, p. XX, for details on this). Second, huge armies are expensive to supply, being effectively cities on the march (See Chapter 10, **Supply**, p. XX). Mustering a huge army can bankrupt a realm. Third, in the unfortunate event that the realm’s army is defeated, the leader will have no forces with which to continue the war or maintain his rule. Most leaders will muster the minimum force necessary for a given conflict, or even better, allow the conflict to be settled by forces available to a vassal at the point of conflict.

The Vassal Troops by Realm Size table assumes garrison expenditures of 2gp per peasant family each month. Borderlands and outlands domains will have more troops, as will highly militarized societies. A realm engaged in “total war” might have a garrison 50 – 100% larger than listed.

| Earl/Count | 16 – 36 | 4,600 – 8,500 | 1,500gp | 9,600 – 17,000gp | 460 – 850 | Week |
| Viscount | 4 – 6 | 960 – 1,280 | 640gp | 1,920 – 2,560gp | 100 – 130 | Week |
| Baron | 1 | 120-200 | 320gp | 240 – 400gp | 12 – 20 | Week |

###### Time Required

When a call to arms is issued, one half the requested troops (rounded up) will arrive within the first time period after the leader begins mustering troops. Another quarter (rounded down, minimum 1) will arrive during the second time period. The remainder of the troops becomes available in the third period.

The lengthy amount of time required to muster troops must be weighed against the costs and risk of doing so. The long period of time required for vast empires and kingdoms to raise all their forces is another reason why many leaders opt to have battles settled by lower-rank vassals close to the action.

Troops called to arms will generally muster at the realm leader’s stronghold, unless ordered to muster elsewhere. If the realm is highly dispersed geographically, or its constituent domains have been isolated by enemy troops, troops may not be able to muster in one place. The Judge should use his discretion in determining where troops will rendezvous in these cases.

###### Standing Armies

Rather than rely on vassals troops, a leader might maintain a standing army instead. A standing army sufficient to protect a realm is very expensive, usually requiring the leader to demand Scutage from his vassals of 1gp or more per peasant family. Each gp levied counts as demanding a duty, so levies of 2gp or more may provoke Henchman Morale rolls by the vassals, just as calling up troops will. However, the ruler can mollify his vassals by placing troops in their domains under their (delegated) control using the Troops favor.

Standing armies tend to be parceled out across the realm to supplement the garrisons of vassal rulers in threatened areas, so in practice there may be little distinction between a standing army and an army of vassal troops. If parceled out, the same time is required as with other vassal troops. The biggest difference between the two may be the nature of the troops. Leaders who rely on their vassals to provide troops can expect to get conscripts recruited from the various domains of their realms, while leaders who maintain standing armies usually hire mercenaries.

### Elite Troops (Optional)

From time to time, army leaders might attempt to find and recruit troops that have all been taught a particular class power or proficiency, such as Precise Shooting or Skirmishing. The rules for these **elite troops** can be found in *Axioms 4: War.* When all of the troops in a unit know the same proficiency, it affects their unit characteristics when using *Domains at War: Battles.* If you are not using the optional mechanics found in *Axioms 4* and *D@W:B,* just note:

* Elite troops cost an additional 1gp per month for every 6gp of regular wage, with a minimum additional monthly wage of 3gp.
* Elite troops gain a +1 bonus to their attack throws during their battle turn (p. XX).

## Army Organization

A body of men without order, organization, and officers cannot wage war. Once a leader has raised an army, he must organize it into **units** and **divisions**.

### Units

Troops in an army are organized into company-sized units. Each unit may have up to 120 man-sized creatures, 60 large (cavalry or ogre-sized) creatures, 20 huge creatures, 5 gigantic creatures, or 1 colossal creature. Where possible, units should consist exclusively of creatures of the same race, class, level, Hit Dice, and equipment.

If necessary, units may be made of any mix of creatures. Each unit has a minimum equivalent of 20 men or other normal-sized creatures, and a maximum equivalent of 120 men. Large creatures such as bears, ogres, or human cavalry on horses count as 2 men. Huge creatures such as chimeras, hill giants, or wyverns count as 6 men. Gigantic creatures such as giant crocodiles, mammoths, or stegosaurs count as 24 men. Colossal creatures such as ancient dragons, giant rocs, or black worms count as 120 men. Living and undead creatures cannot be part of the same unit. Infantry and cavalry cannot be part of the same unit.

EXAMPLE: Marcus has 60 heavy cavalry, 360 heavy infantry, 360 light infantry, and 360 bowmen. He divides these troops into 1 unit of 60 heavy cavalry, 3 units of 120 heavy infantry, 3 units of 120 light infantry, and 3 units of 120 bowmen, for a total of 10 units.

### Divisions

After the army’s troops have been divided into units, the next step is to assign those units to divisions. A division represents a group of units positioned in proximity to each other in the army’s line of battle and supervised by a **commander** reporting to the army’s leader.

An army must have a minimum of three units and can have a maximum number of divisions equal to the maximum number of henchmen the army leader may retain, i.e. four plus his Charisma bonus or penalty. If the army leader has Leadership proficiency, the number of divisions permitted in his army is increased by one. (See also **leadership ability**,p. XX).

EXAMPLE: Marcus has CHA 16 (+2) and Leadership proficiency. His army may have up to (4+2+1) 7 divisions. Since he has only 10 units, he decides to organize his army into 4 divisions. The first division is assigned his 1 unit of heavy cavalry. Each of the other divisions is assigned 1 unit of heavy infantry, 1 unit of light infantry, and 1 unit of bowmen.

## Army Command

After the leader has organized his army into units and divisions, he must assign officers to it. Officers consist of **commanders**, **adjutants**, and **lieutenants**. Each division must have a commander. Each commander may have an adjutant. Each unit may have a lieutenant. Only exceptionally well-trained and organized armies, such as the historical Roman legion, will have lieutenant characters for every unit.

The army leader will generally serve as one of the commanders, while other adventurers or high-level henchmen and followers fill the remaining commander and adjutant positions. If an army has lieutenants, these might be drawn from the henchmen of the various commanders. Alternatively, **mercenary officers** (p. XX) can be hired as commanders, adjutants, and lieutenants.

### Qualifying as an Officer

A PC or NPC must be at least 6th level to serve as a commander or adjutant in a campaign battle, and must be of at least 5th level to serve as a lieutenant.

A monster must have at least four more Hit Dice than is average for the creatures it commands to serve as a commander in a campaign battle, and at least two more Hit Dice than is average to serve as a lieutenant. However, a beastman chieftain can always serve as a commander for units of its own race, regardless of its HD. Likewise, a beastman sub-chieftain can always serve as a lieutenant for a unit of its race.

The officer requirements can be waived by the Judge if he feels a particular PC, NPC, or monster is in a position to command units despite not meeting these qualifications.

### Officer Characteristics

Commanders have three officer characteristics: **leadership ability**, **strategic ability**, and **morale modifier**. Adjutants only use strategic ability, while lieutenants only use morale modifier, but it is worth calculating their other characteristics because they might later be appointed commanders to replace casualties.

**Leadership Ability:** This is the maximum number of units the character can readily control at once during a battle. (It also determines the number of divisions a leader may have in his army, as explained earlier). A character’s leadership ability is equal to the number of henchmen the character may retain, i.e. 4 plus his Charisma bonus or penalty. If the commander has Leadership proficiency, the commander’s leadership ability is increased by 1. If the commander is using an adjutant, his Leadership Ability is reduced by 1. The maximum leadership ability is 8.

EXAMPLE: Marcus has CHA 16 (+2) and Leadership proficiency. His leadership ability is (4 + 2 + 1) 7.

For monstrous officers without Charisma scores, calculate leadership ability as 3 + 1 per 4 HD, rounded down, to a maximum of 8.

EXAMPLE: An orc chieftain has 4 HD, so it will have a leadership ability of (3 + 4/4) 4. A venerable red dragon has 20 HD, so it will have a leadership ability of (3 + (20/4)) 8.

**Strategic Ability***:*This rates the character’s military puissance and effectiveness. Great strategic ability demands great cunning and iron will and no truly superior officer will be lacking in either. An officer’s strategic ability score equals his bonus from either high Intellect or Will (whichever is better, minimum 0), less his penalty from low Intellect or Will (whichever is worse, maximum 0). For each rank of Military Strategy proficiency the officer possesses, his strategic ability is increased by 1. The minimum strategic ability is -3 and the maximum strategic ability is +6.

EXAMPLE: Marcus has INT 14 (+1), WIL 11 (0), and 2 ranks of Military Strategy. His strategic ability is (1 – 0 + 2) +3.

EXAMPLE: Seanan has INT 18 (+3), WIL 7 (-1), and 3 ranks of Military Strategy. His strategic ability is (+3 – 1 + 3) +5.

A commander with an adjutant can use his adjutant’s Strategic Ability – 1 in place of his own.

EXAMPLE: Marcus has strategic ability +3. Seanan, with strategic ability +5, is Marcus’s adjutant. Marcus can use Seanan’s strategic ability – 1, so he functions as if his strategic ability were at +4 because of the wise counsel of his adjutant.

For monstrous officers without Intellect or Will scores, their strategic ability is 0 + 1 per 5 HD, rounded down. If the monster is of generally sub-human intelligence (e.g., beastmen) strategic ability is reduced by 1. If the monster is of generally high intelligence (e.g. medusas or vampires), strategic ability is increased by 1. If the monster is of super-human intelligence (e.g., venerable dragons), it is increased by 2. The Judge might adjust the strategic ability score based on his assessment of the monster’s experience and tactical knowledge.

EXAMPLE: An orc chieftain has a strategic ability of [(4 / 5, rounded down) – 1], or -1. A venerable red dragon (20 HD) has a strategic ability of [(20 / 5) + 2] +6.

**Morale Modifier:** A character’s morale modifier modifies rolls on the Unit Morale table (p. XX) made by units under his command. (Morale modifier does notaffect rolls on the Unit Loyalty table!) Morale modifier is equal to the character’s Charisma bonus or penalty. If the character is a barbarian, bard, explorer, fighter, or paladin of 5th level or higher, his morale modifier is increased by +1 (from his **battlefield prowess** class power or equivalent). If a character has Command proficiency, his morale modifier is increased by +2. If a commander uses an adjutant’s strategic ability in place of his own, he inspires less confidence in his troops, so his morale modifier is decreased by 1. Some class powers and random events can also adjust a character’s morale modifier.

EXAMPLE: Marcus is a 9th level fighter with CHA 16 (+2) and the Command proficiency. His morale modifier is (2 + 1 + 2) +5. If he makes Seanan his adjutant, his morale modifier is reduced to +4, however.

For monstrous officers without Charisma scores, their morale modifier is usually 0. However, whenever the monster entry notes that “as long as [monstrous commander] is alive, the [monsters of a given type] will gain a [bonus] to morale rolls,” use the listed bonus as the monster’s morale modifier.

EXAMPLE: As long as an orc chieftain is alive, orcs gain a +2 to morale rolls. An orc chieftain’s morale modifier is +2.

### Role of Officers

An officer’s leadership ability, strategic ability, and morale modifier impact the success of his troops in waging war. An army with mediocre officers, or insufficient numbers of officers given the size of the army, will be substantially disadvantaged in fighting. These mechanics are detailed hereafter and intensively explored in ***Domains at War: Battles****.*

## Organization and Command in Very Small or Very Large Armies

A typical army built using the rules above will have 10 to 25 units, representing a force of around 600 to 3,000 combatants. This is a perfectly sized army for war-mongering barons, earls, counts, and dukes, such as most adventuring player characters. However, high-level ***ACKS***campaigns can feature far larger armies, with battles between empires fielding tens of thousands of troops on each side. Other campaigns might feature clashes between war bands of a few hundred troops.

When armies are very small or very large, the company-scale unit and division structure outlined above will not suffice. If the army has 600 or fewer troops, organize its troops into **platoon-scale** units. If the army has 3,001 to 12,000 troops, organize its troops into **battalion-scale** units. If the army has 12,001 or more troops, organize its troops into **brigade-scale** units.

Larger-sized units require more experienced officers. The stricter qualification requirements serve to keep the number of officers to a manageable level. While there are obviously still low- and mid-level characters leading smaller sub-formations in the army, they don’t need to be tracked. Just as company-sized units are subsumed into battalions and brigades, the company-scale officers are subsumed into the units they are part of.

Conversely, smaller-sized units require less experienced offers. Low- and mid-level characters can serve as important commanders and lieutenants in battles of this scale. The Army Size and Unit Scale table shows the unit scale, troops per unit, commander qualifications, and lieutenant qualifications recommended for each army size.

A typical realm will simply not have a lieutenant available for every unit of each size. Lieutenants become progressively scarcer for larger units, reflecting the difficulty of finding competent people capable of managing large bodies of troops. About two-thirds of platoons will have a lieutenant and about one-half of companies, but only one-fourth of battalions and brigades.

|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Army Size** | **Unit Scale** | **Troops/Unit** | **Commander Qualification** | **Lieutenant Qualification** |
| 120 – 600 | Platoon | x¼: 30 infantry, 15 cavalry | NPC: 4th level; Monster: HD + 2 | NPC: 3rd level: Monster: HD + 1 |
| 601 – 3,000 | Company | x1: 120 infantry, 60 cavalry | NPC: 6th level; Monster: HD + 4 | NPC: 5th level; Monster: HD + 2 |
| 3,001 – 12,000 | Battalion | x4: 480 infantry, 240 cavalry | NPC: 8th level; Monster: HD + 6 | NPC: 7th level; Monster: HD + 4 |
| 12,001 or more | Brigade | x16: 1,920 infantry, 960 cavalry | NPC: 10th level; Monster: HD +8 | NPC: 9th level; Monster: HD + 6 |

### Beastmen Officers

As noted under **Qualifying as an Officer** (p. XX), a beastman chieftain can always serve as a commander for company-sized units of its own race, regardless of its HD; and a beastman sub-chieftain can always serve as a lieutenant for a company-sized unit of its race.

At platoon scale, a beastman sub-chieftain can always serve as a commander or lieutenant for units of its race, regardless of its HD. At battalion and brigade scale, beastman leaders do not receive any particular edge — beastmen tend to fare poorly in large-scale warfare.

### Rump Troops

When organizing small- and large-scale armies, there will often be a “rump” of excess troops left over. If the rump is less than half a unit, ignore the rump (assume it represents reserves, trainees, or sick troops). If the rump is at least half a unit, organize it as one or more understrength units. With large-scale units, you can sometimes reduce the “rump” by rounding the sizes to the nearest interval of 500, e.g. 500 infantry per battalion or 2,000 infantry per brigade, again assuming any excess is reserves, sick troops, and so on.

EXAMPLE #1: Balbus, a 14th level cleric, has become Theocrat of Aura. He raises a vast army for a crusade against Kemesh. His army consists of 6,000 heavy cavalry; 18,000 heavy infantry; 18,000 light infantry, and 18,000 bowmen, for a total of 60,000 troops. Since the army is greater than 12,000 troops, he organizes it into brigade-sized units. He divides the troops into 6 brigades of 960 heavy cavalry each; 9 brigades of 1,920 heavy infantry each; 9 brigades of 1,920 light infantry each; and 9 brigades of 1,920 bowmen each. The “rump” of excess troops is ignored. He has a total of 33 brigade-sized units in his army. Balbus has CHA 14 (+1) and Leadership proficiency. His army may have up to (4+1+1) 6 divisions. He decides to organize his army as follows:

* 1st division with six brigades of heavy cavalry
* 2nd division with four brigades of heavy infantry and two brigades of bowmen
* 3rd division with four brigades of heavy infantry and two brigades of bowmen
* 4th division with four brigades of light infantry and two brigades of bowmen
* 5th division with four brigades of light infantry and two brigades of bowmen
* 6th division with one brigade of heavy infantry, one brigade of light infantry, and one brigade of bowmen

Because the army is organized into brigade-sized units, any unit lieutenants will need to be at least 9th level, and each division commander will need to be at least 10th level.

EXAMPLE #2: An orc village is going to war. The village consists of 1 orc chief, 6 sub-chieftains, 30 champions (1+1 Hit Dice each), and 180 orcs. The orc chief organizes his army into seven platoons. Six platoons consist of 30 orcs each. The seventh platoon consists of 30 champions. The orc chief has a leadership ability of 4, so he may have up to four divisions in his army. He organizes his divisions as follows:

* 1st division with one platoon of orc champions, commanded by the orc chief
* 2nd division with two platoons of orcs, commanded by an orc sub-chief
* 3rd division with two platoons of orcs, commanded by an orc sub-chief
* 4th division with two platoons of orcs, commanded by an orc sub-chief

The remaining three orc sub-chiefs are distributed as lieutenants.

## Troop Characteristics Summary

The following tables summarize thecharacteristics for common demi-human, human, and beastman troops. All mercenaries and followers previously presented in ***ACKS Core***,the ***Player’s Companion***,and the ***Domains at War: Campaigns***supplement are described.

**Notes:**

* When several equipment loadouts exist for a given troop type, the default mercenary loadout is listed as “A”, while variant types are listed as “B”, “C”, etc. Some followers are of variant types. Other availability of variant types is at the Judge’s discretion.
* Cavalry characteristics are separated by a “/” to separate the AC, HD, hp, # of attacks, and damage of rider and mount.
* BR, or “Battle Rating”, measures the troop’s value on the battlefield. The listed BR is per creature. See Chapter 11, **Battle Ratings,** p. XX.

## Unit Characteristics Summary

The following tables summarize thecharacteristics for common demi-human, human, and beastman troops.

**Daily Move/Weekly Move:** See Chapter 10, **Moving Armies,** p. XX.

**Monthly Wage:** Monthly wage is equal to the troops’ monthly wage x 120 (for infantry) or x 60 (for cavalry or large creatures).

**Supply Cost:** Supply cost is generally 60gp per week for infantry units and 240gp per week for cavalry units. Units without quartermasters, and carnivorous units, cost more. See Chapter 10, **Supply Cost**, p. XX.

**Specialist Cost:** For all units except untrained conscripts and militia, we assume there is 1 quartermaster (40gp) and 1 armorer, 2 journeymen, and 4 apprentices (costing 160gp) per 480 infantry or 240 cavalry troops, for a net cost per company of (50 + 160)/4 = 50gp.

**Cost to Field:** The cost to field a unit is equal to monthly wage cost plus monthly specialist cost plus 4 x weekly supply cost.

**Battle Rating**: The measure of the unit’s value on the battlefield. See Chapter 11, **Battle Ratings**, p. XX.

# Chapter 10: Maneuvers

Once a leader has raised and equipped his army, he may begin to wage war. Wars are fought in a series of **military campaigns**. A military campaign begins when an army’s troops are taken out of their garrisons, and ends when the army’s troops return to garrison. A short military campaign will last one month. Longer campaigns can last seasons or even years. Hannibal of Carthage fought a ten year campaign against the Romans during the Second Punic War.

## Regions

Military campaigns take place within **regions**, consisting of several domains or realms. Regions should be mapped on sheets of hex graph paper beforehand, so that the Judge knows the layout of the land. The **regional map** should show the terrain type in each hex, and indicate the location of major domains, urban settlements, navigable waterways, and roads.

***ACKS****-*compatiblemedium region hex paper, available for free download at [www.autarch.co](http://www.autarch.co), is ideal for regional maps. This hex paper is 32 6-mile hexes wide and 48 6-mile hexes long. A set of larger 24-mile hexes, 8 wide and 12 long, are superimposed on top for easy reference. The medium region map is sufficient for a principality or portion of a kingdom. Larger regions can be plotted by adjusting the scale upwards so that each small hex equals 24 miles.

## Campaign Activities

When on campaign, armies generally take actions in time increments of **weeks.** During each week of a military campaign, the Judge should follow the procedure below:

1. **Initial Reconnaissance:** The Judge makes an initial **reconnaissance roll** (p. XX) for each army to determine what intelligence it learns about nearby opposing armies, if any. This represents information gleaned from scouting reports, spies, etc.
2. **Initiative:** Each army’s leader calculates his initiative score by rolling 1d6 and adding his **strategic ability** (p. XX) to the roll. Before rolling, the leader may order a **forced march** (p. XX) in order to gain a +2 bonus to their initiative score. Resolve any ties in favor of the leader with higher strategic ability; if still tied, re-roll.
3. **Movement, Reconnaissance, and Battles:** Starting with the leader with highest initiative score and counting downward, each leader now has the opportunity to move his army. A leader may choose to delay his army’s initiative until a lower count is reached, down to the negative value of his initiative score. The army with the initiative is called the “acting army.”
   1. The acting army selects its **strategic stance** (p. XX),either offensive, defensive, or evasive.
   2. The acting army conducts any desired **movement** (p. XX) on the regional map. If this takes the acting army into a domain controlled by another leader without his permission, the army is considered to have **invaded** the domain (p. XX).
   3. If, as the acting army moves, it enters the same 6-mile hex as an opposing army, the Judge makes an additional **reconnaissance roll** for the acting and opposing army to determine what intelligence they learn about each other.
   4. If the acting army is in the same 6-mile hex as an opposing army, those armies might fight a **battle**. Battles are discussed in Chapter 11, **Battles**. If one of the armies is in a stronghold, a **siege** might result. Sieges are discussed in Chapter 12, **Sieges**. If no battle occurs, the acting army continues its movement.
   5. After the results of any battles or sieges triggered by the acting army are resolved, the initiative passes to the leader with the next highest initiative score. His army now becomes the acting army.
4. **Supply:** Each army checks if it is in **supply** (p. XX). If so, it pays its supply cost. If not, it resolves the consequences of lack of supplies.
5. **Occupation and Conquest:** The outcome of any **invasions** by the various armies are resolved. Successful invaders get an opportunity for **occupation**, **conquest**,and **pillage**.These mechanics are discussed in the **Invading, Occupying, Conquering, and Pillaging Domains** section (p. XX).

When opposing armies are within one week’s movement of each other, the Judge should shift the time increment to **days** instead of weeks. This allows for close maneuver of the opposing forces. When resolving actions in daily increments, the Judge should follow the same steps as above. Movement, battles, invasion, reconnaissance rolls, and other activities should be addressed daily. However, supply should still only be checked once per week unless the army is in barrens or desert terrain.

Conversely, if the opposing armies are so far apart as to make interaction impossible, the Judge should dispense with these steps and simply adjudicate each army’s movement and activities in a more casual manner. The weekly increments can be thought of as similar to the turns of a dungeon crawl — sometimes tracking turns is very important, and other times it’s not at all.

## Strategic Stance

An army on campaign must be assigned a **strategic stance**. Strategic stance determines how an army reacts when it detects opposing armies. An army’s strategic stance may be either **offensive**, meaning that the army is actively seeking battle with opposing armies; **defensive**, meaning the army will fight if battle is offered by an opposing army, but will not otherwise attack; or **evasive**,meaning the army will avoid battle if possible.

When an army chooses its stance, it must designate one-quarter to one-third of its divisions to be its **vanguard** and another one-quarter to one-third to be in the **rear guard**. The remaining divisions are in the **main body**. Divisions in the vanguard lead the marching order and are the most likely to fight an offensive battle. Divisions in the rear guard cover the flank of an evading army’s other divisions and are the most likely formation to fight an evasive battle.

Any army’s strategic stance can be changed freely each time initiative is rolled. With the Judge’s permission, it can also be changed when a new opposing army is detected. Strategic stance is discussed further in Chapter 11, **Battles**.

## Moving Armies

Armies move on the regional map. The daily and weekly movement rates of an army are related directly to encounter movement rates of its troops, as shown on the adjacent table.

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Exploration**  **Speed** | **Daily**  **Expedition Speed** | **Weekly**  **Expedition Speed** |
| *Feet per Turn* | *Miles /*  *6-Mile Hexes* | *Miles /*  *24-Mile Hexes* |
| 30’ | 6 / 1 | 24 / 1 |
| 60’ | 12 / 2 | 48 / 2 |
| 90’ | 18 / 3 | 72 / 3 |
| 120’ | 24 / 4 | 96 / 4 |
| 150’ | 30 / 5 | 120 / 5 |
| 180’ | 36 / 6 | 144 / 6 |
| 210’ | 42 / 7 | 168 / 7 |
| 240’ | 48 / 8 | 192 / 8 |
| 270’ | 54 / 9 | 216 / 9 |
| 300’ | 60 / 10 | 240 / 10 |
| 330’ | 66 / 11 | 264 / 11 |
| 360’ | 72 / 12 | 288 / 12 |

Naturally, any army traveling in formation moves at the rate of its slowest unit. The movement rates shown on the table above are figured based on a full day of travel through open, clear terrain. Terrain type (p. XX) and weather (p. XX) will modify speed.

### Rest and Recuperation

When moving over long distances, armies are required to rest for three days out of every seven in order to re-supply and care for their pack animals. The weekly speed on the adjoining table takes into account this mandatory rest period.

If an army marches more than four days out of seven without resting, all its units become **fatigued** until they have caught up on the required rest.

**Tireless Troops:** Certain troops, such as constructs, have no need to rest. Such units can march every day, and even conduct a forced marching without penalty if desired (see below).

### Forced Marching

When necessary, armies can engage in a forced march. A leader may order a forced march either before initiative is rolled or during his initiative. If the leader orders a forced march before initiative is rolled, he gets a +2 bonus to his initiative score. This represents awakening the troops early for a pre-dawn start. A leader who orders a forced march during his initiative does not get this bonus. Either way, the army’s daily movement rate is increased by 50% because of the forced march.

The army must rest for one day after force marching or it becomes **fatigued**. This penalty applies even if the army does not actually move more than its normal daily movement.

### Movement of Large Armies

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Movement of Large Armies** | | |
| **Army Size** | **Column**  **Length** | **Speed**  **Multiplier** |
| Less than 16 brigades | 3 miles (1 hex) | x1 |
| 16 – 26 brigades | 6 miles (1 hexes) | X2/3 |
| 27 – 32 brigades | 9 miles (1.5 hexes) | x1/2 |
| 33 brigades or more | 12 miles (2 hexes) | x1/3 |

Most armies occupy one 6-mile hex or less, and can march at about the same pace as individual men and horses. Large armies with multiple brigades, however, require such long columns of march that they occupy additional hexes on the regional map, and move much slower. The Movement of Large Armies table shows the column length and movement multiplier based on the size of the army.

Regardless of size, an army begins and ends its weekly or daily march in one hex. The column length is the length during the march. The speed multiplier due to army size is applied on top of the speed multiplier for terrain. If a multi-hex army occupies two or more different types of terrain, apply the speed multiplier of the terrain the leading element of the army has just entered.

EXAMPLE: Audarius Tarkaun is commanding an army of 32 infantry brigades and 8 heavy cavalry brigades (40 brigades total). The strategic turns are one week long and his army has a movement rate of 48 miles per week. It is traveling on a road, so speed is increased to 72 miles per week. However, the size of the army reduces that to 24 miles per week. As it moves, his army column extends a length of 12 miles (2 hexes).

If an army’s column length in miles exceeds its modified speed in miles, then the army’s column length is reduced to its speed. This represents such slow movement that the vanguard of the army is forced to halt and start pitching camp before the rearguard has even left the prior day’s camp.

When Tarkaun’s army nears the enemy, gameplay switches to daily turns. His army’s movement rate is 12 miles per day, modified to 18 miles per day by the road, and further modified to 6 miles per day by the army size. The army’s column length is only 6 miles.

Because large armies move so slowly, it can sometimes be advantageous to split the army into divisions and have each division march separately. Each of the divisions then functions a separate army for all purposes until the armies regroup by moving back into the same hex.

### Movement of War Machines

**War machines**, which include all types of artillery, battering rams, galleries, hoists, screws, and siege towers, can be moved either assembled or disassembled. Assembled war machines move at a speed of 30’ per turn (6 miles per day and 24 miles per week), while disassembled war machines move at a speed of 60’ per turn (12 miles per day and 48 miles per week).

Assembling and disassembling a war machine is a **construction project** (p. XX) with a construction cost equal to 1/100 the cost of constructing the war machine from scratch (minimum one day). Disassembled war machines cannot be used until they are assembled, so an army that has to suddenly pitch battle, or is surprised on the march, will not have access to any disassembled artillery and other devices.

### Effects of Weather Conditions

The effects of weather conditions on armies are noted below. All effects are cumulative. For example, if both Cold and Snowy conditions are indicated, movement will be reduced to 25% normal (50% x 50%) while disease will have a 20% chance of occurring.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Effects of Severe Weather | |
| *Temperature* | |
| Frigid | The army’s expedition speed is halved. Mounts cannot graze to avoid supply cost. The army suffers a 10% chance of a disease vagary each week due to exposure. Troops without protective clothing suffer a morale calamity each week that frigid temperatures endure. |
| Cold | The army suffers a 5% chance of a disease vagary each week due to exposure. |
| Moderate | No effects |
| Sweltering | The army’s expedition speed is halved. Troops in heavy armor must strip down to medium or lighter armor. Supply cost increased 25% due to more water consumption. Out of supply penalties are doubled due to heat exhaustion and dehydration. |
| *Precipitation* | |
| Sunbaked | No effects |
| Drizzly/Flurry | No effects |
| Rainy/Snowy | The army’s expedition speed is halved. Reconnaissance rolls suffer -2 penalty due to limited visibility. Missile units suffer a -2 penalty to attack throws. The army suffers a 10% chance of a disease vagary each week due to wetness. |
| *Wind* |  |
| Windy | The army’s expedition speed is halved. In barren or desert terrain, reconnaissance rolls suffer -4 penalty due to sandstorms. Missile units suffer a -2 penalty to attack throws. |
| Stormy | The army’s expedition speed is quartered. In barren or desert terrain, reconnaissance rolls suffer -4 penalty due to sandstorms. Missile units suffer a -4 penalty to attack throws. |

## Supplying Armies

An army on campaign must periodically receive **supplies** or suffer severe consequences. In order to receive supplies, an army must meet three conditions. First, it must be able to pay a **supply cost** (in gold pieces). Second, it must have a sufficiently valuable **supply base** or bases.Third, it must have a clear **line of supply** to its supply base when supply is checked.

### Supply Cost

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Unit**  **Scale** | **Cost Per**  **Infantry Unit** | **Cost Per**  **Cavalry Unit** |
| Platoon | 15gp | 60gp |
| Company | 60gp | 240gp |
| Battalion | 240gp | 960gp |
| Brigade | 960gp | 3,840gp |

Each week, the supply cost is 60gp for each unit of 120 infantry; and 240gp for each unit of 60 cavalry or 60 large creatures. The ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual***has a list of weekly supply costs for other types of creatures. Armies with smaller- or larger- scale units cost proportionately more to supply per unit.

The costs are inclusive of fresh bread, wheat, and water, as well as pack animals and handlers for the transport of the provisions.

EXAMPLE: Marcus’s army consists of 12 brigade-sized infantry units and 4 brigade-sized cavalry units. His army’s supply cost is [12 x 960) + (4 x 3,840)] 26,880gp per week.

**Carnivorous Troops:** Most units are fed wheat, oats, grass, and similar inexpensive foodstuffs. If a unit’s troops or mounts are carnivorous (e.g. beast riders, dragons, ghouls), the unit will be much more expensive to supply. The supply cost for these units is generally four times higher.

As supplying carnivores can be quite expensive, these units are sometimes fed battle **casualties** (p. XX) or **prisoners captured** (p. XX and p. XX) in battle or from pillage. Each casualty or prisoner supplies 1gp of meat per 1.5 st of weight. (A typical human prisoner would therefore provide 10gp worth of meat.) A non-Chaotic unit which sees casualties or prisoners of its own race eaten by a carnivorous unit from its own army suffers a calamity (triggering a loyalty roll) due to the innate repulsiveness of the practice.

EXAMPLE: Moruvai’s army includes a unit of 60 goblin wolf riders. The wolf riders cost (240 x 4) 960gp per week to supply.

When Moruvai’s army captures 500 human commoners, the ruthless ruinguard decides to use the prisoners as food for the wolf riders. Human commoners weigh 15 st (150 lbs) each. Therefore they supply (500 x 15 / 1.5 ) = 5,000gp worth of meat to the wolf riders, enough to keep the unit in supply for more than 5 weeks.

However, Moruvai’s army includes four units of Neutral-aligned human mercenaries. Upon seeing prisoners of their race devoured by the wolf riders, each of these units must now make a loyalty roll. One of the units fails its roll and deserts. Undeterred, Moruvai sends his wolf riders to capture the deserters. Some problems create their own solutions…

**Hungerless Troops:** Certain troops, such as constructs, have no need to eat or drink. Such units have no supply cost and do not have to maintain lines of supply. They are never considered out of supply.

### Supply Base

A supply base converts supply cost (gold) into food, water, and other provisions. Any friendly or occupied city, town, or stronghold can serve as a supply base. In order to be in supply, an army requires one or more supply bases whose total value equals or exceeds its supply cost.The value of a supply base is the sum of the following:

* The monthly income (after expenses) of the supply base;
* The monthly income (after expenses) of any friendly domains in the same 24-mile hex as the supply base; and
* The value of any supply bases to which the supply base itself has a clear line of supply (see below)

EXAMPLE #1: Marcus’s supply base is Cyfaraun, a city of 2,550 families in a domain of 7,500 families. Cyfaraun’s total monthly income is 62,400gp. Cyfaraun has a clear line of supply to Arganos, a Class II city with a supply value of 110,000gp. Cyfaraun is therefore a supply base with a value of (62,400 + 110,000) 172,400gp, easily valuable enough to serve as the supply base for Marcus’s army.

EXAMPLE #2: Later in the war, Marcus has greatly expanded his army, and now has a supply cost of 65,000gp. Meanwhile, Arganos has become besieged, so there is no longer a clear line of supply to it from Cyfaraun. Cyfaraun is now worth only 62,400gp as a supply base. It is no longer of sufficient value to serve as a supply base for Marcus’s expanded force.

If necessary an army can construct its own supply bases. As a 10,000gp construction project, an army can build a small border fort that can serve as a Class VI market. By building such supply bases periodically as necessary to maintain a clear line of supply, the army can create a chain of supply bases back to a large capital.

EXAMPLE: With Cyfaraun no longer sufficient to serve as his supply base, Marcus must find a larger supply base. The city of Kavala is the last friendly city of sufficient size to be his supply base, but Kavala is separated from his army by 900 miles of desert. Marcus decides to construct a chain of 38 forts, each 24 miles apart, stretching from his army’s area of operation all the way back to Kavala. It will cost 380,000gp to build these forts, but Marcus will have a supply base for campaigns anywhere between the borderlands and Kavala… assuming that the enemy does not capture one of the “links” in the chain of forts.

An army may change its supply base(s) at any time. For instance, if it captures a stronghold near the front lines, it can begin to use the captured stronghold as its supply base.

### Line and Length of Supply

The **line of supply** is the route between the army and its supply base, or from one supply base to another. To function, a line of supply must be **clear**. A line of supply is clear if it is neither **blocked** nor **overextended** when supply is checked. Supply is checked weekly, except in barrens or desert terrain, where it is checked daily.

A supply line becomes **blocked** if the route passes through any hexes **occupied** by at least a unit of enemy troops. The size of the unit must be at least equal to the unit scale of the army whose supply line is being blocked. An army with a blocked supply line is out of supply until the enemy forces are driven off or a new, unobstructed route is found for the supplies.

EXAMPLE: An army of 6 heavy infantry companies and 2 light cavalry companies can have its supply line blocked in a hex by one enemy company. An army of 6 heavy infantry brigades and 2 light cavalry brigades can only have its supply line blocked in a hex by an enemy brigade.

A supply line becomes **overextended** if the route between the army and its supply base is too long. The length that the supply line can extend is limited by the terrain the supply line traverses.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Each Hex of Terrain | Counts as |
| Barrens, Desert | 4 hexes |
| Jungle, Mountain, Swamp | 2 hexes |
| Hills, Forest | 3/2 hexes |
| Grassland, Shrubland | 1 hex |
| Road | 1/2 hex |
| Navigable Waterway | No hexes |

Determining whether a supply line is overextended is a simple matter. Just count the number of 6-mile hexes between the army and its supply base. Count each barren or desert hex as four hexes. Count each jungle, mountain, or swamp hex as two hexes. Count every two hill or forest hexes as three hexes. Count each grassland and scrub hex. Count every two road hexes as just one hex. Do not count hexes where the route runs along a navigable waterway at all! If the total count exceeds 16 hexes (96 miles), the line of supply is overextended.

An army with an overextended supply line is out of supply until it shortens its supply line to within the permitted length.

EXAMPLE #1: Marcus’s army departs from Cyfaraun, marching along an old imperial road for 32 hexes (192 miles). Every 4 road hex counts as 1 hex, so the length of the supply line is (32/2) 16 hexes. The army’s supply line is not overextended.

Marcus’s army then enters the harsh desert of the Waste, travelling 3 hexes. Each desert hex counts as 4 hexes, so the length of the army’s supply line is now (32 / 2) 16 hexes from the road and (3 x 4) 12 hexes from the desert, for a total of 28 hexes. Its supply line is overextended, so Marcus’s army is out of supply!

EXAMPLE #2: Baal the Terrible’s army departs its supply base in Zidium and marches 30 hexes (320 miles) along the coast of Celdorea, and then 3 hexes inland across settled grassland terrain towards Dappakosea. Since every grassland hex count as 1 hex, and hexes where the route runs along a navigable waterway are not counted at all, Baal’s army’s supply line only counts as 3 hexes long.

For purposes of measuring their line of supply, elves treat forest terrain as grassland, while dwarves treat hills and mountains as grassland. Beastmen, who have little need for food or drink, eat anything, and forage rapaciously, treat all terrain as grassland.

### Requisitioning and Looting Supplies

While adventurers on an expedition can forage and hunt to meet their needs, armies are too large to sustain themselves in the wild. Instead, an army that is out of supply can **requisition** or **loot** supplies from peasants in the domains it passes through. An orderly requisition of supplies will yield 40gp of supplies per peasant family. This will leave the peasants with sufficient supplies to survive. Supplies can only be requisitioned once per year.

Any additional supplies taken must be looted. Looting will yield up to 20gp of supplies per peasant family, but the more that is taken the less remains for the peasants to survive on. For each 20gp of supplies looted, one peasant family is lost. This represents the flight of farmers to the woods, starvation from soldiers stealing all the food, and losses from resistance to the looting. A domain can be looted until no peasant families remain, yielding supplies totaling 60gp per family (40gp from requisition and 20gp from looting). Such a domain is usually **pillaged** to boot; see **Pillaging Domains**, p. XX.

An army (or detached portion thereof) cannot requisition and/or loot more than its own weekly supply cost each day. An army or part of an army that wishes to gather additional supplies beyond those limits can only do so by pillaging.

EXAMPLE: A company of 60 light cavalry has a supply cost of 240gp per week. Each day, the company could requisition 160gp of supplies and loot another 80gp of supplies, destroying 4 peasant families in the process.

If the domain’s leader takes umbrage at the supplies being requisitioned or looted, he can fight a battle against the invading army, but generally an army large enough to need to requisition supplies is sufficiently large enough that the petty barons and manorial lords do not resist its efforts, provided the lord himself is not harmed.

EXAMPLE: Marcus’s army has encamped in a hex at the borders of the Waste. The hex has 600 peasant families under a local lord. With a supply cost of 27,600gp per week and no supplies coming from Cyfaraun, Marcus’s army needs supplies from the peasants. The local lord, with only a small garrison, dares not resist. Marcus requisitions supplies, and gets (600 x 40) 24,000gp.

Marcus’s army needs more supplies, so despite his moral objections he orders his men to loot another 4,000gp. This causes the loss of (4,000 / 20) 200 peasant families. Marcus’s army is supplied and marches on. The count stares in horror at the ruin that was once his flourishing domain.

A moving army can either requisition all its supplies from one particular hex, or requisition a fraction of its supplies from each hex it travels though. Either way, requisitioning and looting reduces its speed by 50%. If an army force marches while requisitioning and looting, it can move at its normal expedition speed.

An encamped (stationary) army must first requisition supplies from the hexes it is encamped in, and then from adjacent hexes.

### Consequences of Lack of Supplies

Troops which are only partially supplied (but still at least half their full supplies) become **underfed**. Underfed troops suffer a -1 penalty on attack throws, proficiency throws, and saving throws, cannot force march, and cannot heal wounds naturally. As soon as the troops receive all of the required supplies, the underfed condition ends.

Troops which are unsupplied (less than half their full supplies) become **starving**. Starving troops suffer a -1 penalty on attack throws, proficiency throws, and saving throw, lose 3 hit points each week (inflicted on the day they should have been supplied), and cannot force march or heal wounds naturally. Ordinary troops with 1-1 HD will be at 1 hp after the first week, and will be dead after the second week. If the troops receive partial supplies, the starving condition is replaced by the underfed condition, but lost hp are not recovered. If the troops receive full supplies, the starving condition ends and lost hit points are recovered at 1 point per day while they remain in supply.

Troops which are unsupplied in barrens or desert and not in a hex with a river or lake also become **dehydrated**. Dehydrated troops lose 1 hit point per day. Ordinary troops with 1-1 HD will be dead after five days. If the troops receive half supplies or full supplies, the dehydrated condition ends.

Even if an army physically survives lack of supply, it might not survive psychologically. Each week a unit is partially or completely unsupplied counts as a calamity(p. XX), and the unit must make a loyalty roll.

If the army has enough supplies to feed some of its units, but not all, the army’s leader can choose which units to supply and to what extent. If some troops receive full supplies while others receive none, the unsupplied units suffer an additional -1 penalty on their loyalty rolls, as it is evident that they are being left to starve while others feed.

### Supply Simplified

In most cases, field armies that campaign in well-populated areas along roads and waterways can easily maintain their lines of supply. The Judge can simply deduct an army’s supply cost from its leader’s treasury each week, and only check for supply if the army is cut off by enemies, attempts to cross hostile or unsettled terrain, or moves more than 24 miles from a road or waterway.

## Equipment Availability on Campaign

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Army Size** | **Market Class** |
| 72,000 troops or more | II |
| 36,001 – 72,000 troops | III |
| 12,001 – 36,000 troops | IV |
| 3,001 - 12,000 troops | V |
| 1,200 - 3,000 troops | VI |

An army of even modest size will be accompanied by a baggage train that includes merchants, craftsmen, and tinkers that supply the army with its equipment. This allows an army of 1,200 troops (12 units) or more to function as its own market for purposes of **equipment availability**, as shown on the adjacent table. This benefit is lost if the army’s supply lines become blocked or over-extended.

## Reconnaissance and Intelligence

Intelligence gathering is crucial to waging war. Since the means of intelligence gathering that might be employed, and the counter-measures against them, are as limitless as the imagination of players, ***ACKS II***abstracts the various tactics into a set of mechanics called **reconnaissance rolls**.

### Frequency of Reconnaissance rolls

At the start of each week (or day, if in close proximity), the Judge will make an initial reconnaissance rollfor each army to determine what intelligence it has gathered on each nearby opposing army from regular scouting, spies, and so on. The maximum range at which armies can be reconnoitered is determined by its size, as shown on the adjacent Reconnaissance Range table. The “observing army” is the army making the reconnaissance roll, while the “opposing army” is the army being observed.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Reconnaissance Range** | |
| **Opposing Army Size** | **Observing Army Must Be Within** |
| 120 troops or less | One 24-mile hex |
| 121 – 600 troops | Two 24-mile hexes |
| 601 – 3000 troops | Three 24-mile hexes |
| 3,001 troops or more | Four 24-mile hexes |

There is no particular limit to the number of reconnaissance rolls an army will make during initial reconnaissance — if there are three armies within range, it will make three reconnaissance rolls. If there is only one army within range, it will make only one reconnaissance roll.

Anytime there are multiple friendly armies within one 24-mile hex, all armies in that hex are treated as a single army for purposes of initial reconnaissance rolls. For example, if there are 10 watchtowers with 1 unit of cavalry each spread across a 24-mile hex, the Judge will roll for and against them as a single army with 10 units of cavalry.

If, during the course of an acting army’s movement, it enters the same 6 mile hex as an opposing army, both the acting army and opposing army make an additional reconnaissance roll. Multiple opposing armies within one 6-mile hex are always treated as a single army.

Reconnaissance rolls should alwaysbe made by the Judge, so that the army leaders remain unaware of how many rolls were made, and how many they failed.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Reconnaissance Rolls** | |
| **Modified Die Roll** | **Result** |
| 2- | Catastrophe |
| 3 – 5 | Failure |
| 6 – 8 | Marginal Success |
| 9 – 11 | Success |
| 12+ | Major Success |

### Reconnaissance Roll Procedure

To make a reconnaissance roll, the Judge rolls 2d6 and consults the Reconnaissance Rolls table. The die roll should be modified based on the Reconnaissance Modifiers table on the adjoining table. The “observing army” is the army making the reconnaissance roll, while the “opposing army” is the army being observed.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Reconnaissance Modifiers** | **Modifier** |
| **Army Size** |  |
| Opposing army has 600 or fewer troops total | -2 |
| Opposing army has only 601 to 3,000 troops | -1 |
| Opposing army has 3,001 to 12,000 troops total | 0 |
| Opposing army has 12,001 to 36,000 troops total | +1 |
| Opposing army has 36,001 to 72,000 troops total | +2 |
| Opposing army has 72,001 or more troops | +3 |
| **Proximity of Armies** |  |
| Armies are in same 6-mile hex | +2 |
| Armies are in adjacent 6-mile hexes | +1 |
| Armies are in same 24-mile hex | 0 |
| Armies are 1 or more 24-mile hexes away from each other | -1/hex |
| **Leadership** |  |
| Observing army’s leader has higher strategic ability than opposing army’s leader | +1 |
| Opposing army’s leader has higher strategic ability than observing army’s leader | -1 |
| **Magic, Spies, and Stratagems** |  |
| Observing army can observe opposing army with magic (*greater clairvoyance*, scry*,* etc.) | Varies |
| Opposing army can camouflage location with magic (*hidden**host*, *illusory**terrain,* etc.) | Varies |
| Observing army has spy infiltrated within opposing army | +1/spy |
| Observing army can observe opposing army from the air | +2 |
| Observing army has stratagem to reconnoiter or scout enemy position (Judge’s discretion) | Varies |
| Opposing army has stratagem to deceive or trick scouts (Judge’s discretion) | Varies |
| **Scouting and Screening Troops** |  |
| Observing army scouting with 6 to 20 units | +1 |
| Observing army scouting with 21 to 100 units | +2 |
| Observing army scouting 101 or more units | +3 |
| Opposing army screened by 6 to 20 units | -1 |
| Opposing army screened by 21 to 100 units | -2 |
| Opposing army screened by 101 or more units | -3 |
| Observing army has more cavalry units in total than opposing army | +1 |
| Opposing army has more cavalry units in total than observing army | -1 |
| **Terrain** |  |
| Opposing army is in barrens (any), desert (any), grasslands (any), scrubland (low, sparse) | +1 |
| Opposing army is in forest (taiga), hills (rocky),scrubland (high, dense), swamp (marshy) | 0 |
| Opposing army is in forest (deciduous), hills (forested), jungle, mountains (any), swamp (scrubby, forested) | 0 |
| Observing army is more familiar with region than opposing army | +1 |
| Opposing army is more familiar with region than observing army | -1 |

**Proximity of Armies:** If the observing army is dispersed into two or more hexes, determine the proximity by counting the number of hexes between the closest unit of the observing army and the opposing army. If the opposing army is dispersed into two or more hexes, determine the proximity by counting the number of hexes between the observing army and the largest division (or other body of troops) in the opposing army. If both the observing and opposing armies are dispersed into multiple hexes, determine the proximity by counting the number of hexes between the closest unit of the observing army and the largest division in the opposing army.

**Magic — Observation:** Magic can only be used for observation during initial reconnaissance rolls, as the army commander won’t know that additional rolls are occurring as his army moves. Using magic grants a +1 bonus for each of the following spells: *greater clairaudiency*, *greater clairvoyancy*, *lay of the land*, *locate distance object*, *scry.* In addition, the following rules apply:

* *Lay of the Land* always reveals the presence of an enemy army or supply base if within the same 6-mile hex.
* *Locate distant object* always reveals the distance and direction to the designated object (usually an enemy battle standard).
* *Greater clairaudiency*, *greater clairvoyance*, and *scry* allow the observing army to designate a 6-mile hex upon which the magic is used. The observing army then uses either that hex or its actual hex for purposes of proximity, whichever is better. However, if the observing army designates a 6-mile hex outside of its own reconaissance range, it cannot capture prisoners from the reconnaissance roll.

The spellcaster must be able to meet the requirements of the spell in order to use it. For example, to use *scrying,* the caster must be familiar with someone in the opposing army, or already know the location of the opposing army. If an officer is protected by an **amulet of indiscernibility** or the spell of the same name, his location and the location of units under his direct command cannot be scried upon. This does not prevent other officers or units from the army being scried on. Only if everyofficer in the army is protected by an **amulet** or *indiscernibility*is their army protected from scrying.

Other spells, such as *communion*or*contact**other**sphere*,do not modify the reconnaissance roll. However, the Judge should still provide information from these spells using the mechanics described in their spell entry.

**Magic — Camouflage:** Magical camouflage reduces the effective size of the opposing army, which makes the army harder to observe. Each *illusory**terrain*, *hidden**host*,or *permanent**figment* spell can hide one company-sized unit. For example, if an army with seven units employs*hidden**host* to disguise two units, it will count as being an army of five units (600 troops) total for purposes of army size. Even if the reconnaissance roll succeeds, the units hidden by magic will not revealed by the roll. However, interrogation of prisoners might still reveal the existence of these troops.

**Scouting and Screening Troops:** Scouting and screening troops only modify reconnaissance rolls within a limited range around them. Cavalry and flyers on garrison duty will scout and screen within the territory of the domain they garrison. Cavalry and flyers in an army on campaign will only scout and screen the 24-mile hex their army is located in and the adjacent 24-mile hexes. Reconnaissance rolls between armies two or more 24-mile hexes away will therefore not be modified. The table assumes company-sized units; treat 4 platoon-sized units as 1 unit, a battalion-sized unit as 4 units, and a brigade-scale unit as 16 units.

**Spies:** Spies can be infiltrated into an opposing army using the rules in for Hijinks (p. XX).

**Stratagems:** This represents a variable modifier that the Judge can assign based on the actions of PCs and major NPCs. See the **Stratagems** section below.

EXAMPLE: A goblin army (4,320 troops) has just moved into a 24-mile hex of woods occupied by an elven army (1,200 troops). Both armies now get the chance to locate each other. The leader of the elves has a strategic ability of +2, while the leader of the goblins has a strategic ability of -1. The elves have 1 unit of giant hawks (flyers) and 2 units of horse archers (cavalry); the goblins have 16 units of wolf riders (cavalry). The elves are more familiar with the region.

The elven army will make a reconnaissance roll with the following modifiers: -1 (opposing army has 6 to 20 cavalry units), -1 (opposing army has overall more cavalry and flyers units), +1 (superior ranks in military strategy), +1 (more familiar with region), +2 (can observe enemy from the air), -1 (opposing army in woods). The total bonuses and penalties add up to +1, so the Judge will roll 2d6+1 for the elves. The Judge rolls an 8, modified to 9. The elves have rolled a success!

The goblin army will make a reconnaissance roll with the following modifiers: +1 (6 to 20 cavalry units), +1 (army has overall more cavalry and flyers), -1 (inferior ranks in military strategy), -1 (less familiar with region), -1 (opposing army in woods), -1 (opposing army has only 5 to 20 units). The total adds up to -2, so the Judge will roll 2d6-2 for the goblins.

The Judge rolls a 5, modified to a 3; the goblins have failed to gather any information about the elves. In fact, they probably aren’t even aware there is an elven army in the area (unless they knew from a prior reconnaissance roll success).

### Results of Reconnaissance Rolls

A **catastrophe** means that the observing army has gathered false intelligence. The Judge should inform the observing army’s leader that he has rolled a marginal success and pretend to provide intelligence as if that were the case. However, the intelligence will be riddled with falsehoods and misinformation.

A **failure** simply means the observing army has gathered no intelligence. If the opposing army has not yet been detected, then the observing army may be unaware that the observing army is there at all.

A **marginal success, success**, or **major success** means the observing army has gathered some intelligence. The amount of intelligence gathered will depend on the degree of success and the proximity of the two armies, as shown on the **Results of Reconnaissance** table below.

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Results of Reconnaissance Rolls** | | | |
| **Degree of Success** | | | |
| **Proximity of Armies** | **Marginal Success** | **Success** | **Major Success** |
| Same 6-mile Hex | Location (6-mile hex)  Approximate size  Direction of march  Number of divisions  Number of units per division  Common prisoner | Location (6-mile hex)  Approximate size  Direction of march  Number of divisions  Number of units per division  Type of each unit  Valuable prisoner | Location (6-mile hex)  Approximate size  Direction of march  Number of divisions  Number of units per division  Type of each unit  Strength of each unit  Very valuable prisoner |
| Same 24-mile Hex | Location (24-mile hex)  Approximate size  Direction of march  Number of divisions | Location (6-mile hex)  Approximate size  Direction of march  Number of divisions  Number of units per division  Common prisoner | Location (6-mile hex)  Approximate size  Direction of march  Number of divisions  Number of units per division  Type of each unit  Valuable prisoner |
| 1 – 2 24-mile Hexes | Location (within 2 24-mile hexes)  Approximate size  Direction of march | Location (24-mile hex)  Approximate size  Direction of march  Number of divisions | Location (6-mile hex)  Approximate size  Direction of march  Number of divisions  Number of units per division  Common prisoner |
| 3 – 4 24-mile Hexes | Location (within 4 24-mile hexes)  Approximate size | Location (within 2 24-mile hexes)  Approximate size  Direction of march | Location (24-mile hex)  Approximate size  Direction of march  Number of divisions |

**Location:** The observing army learns the location of the opposing army relative to its own position. The precision with which the location is known can range from a wide swath of hexes to a specific 6-mile hex.

EXAMPLE: The modified result of the elven army’s reconnaissance roll was a 9, so the elven army had a success. The elven army is in the same 24-mile hex as the goblin army. Cross-indexing “same 24-mile hex” with “success” on the Results of the Reconnaissance Rolls table, the Judge notes that the elven army learns which 6-mile hex the goblin army occupies. He provides this information to the leader of the elven army.

**Approximate Size:** The observing army learns whether the opposing army is small (600 or fewer troops); average (600 to 3,000 troops); large (3,001 to 12,000 troops); huge (12,001 to 36,000 troops); gigantic (36,001 to 72,000 troops); or colossal (72,001 or more troops).

EXAMPLE: The Judge reveals that the goblin army is large (3,001 to 12,000 troops).

**Direction of March:** The observing army learns the opposing army’s direction of march in the preceding week. In most cases, this is a compass direction on the hex map. However, if the opposing army remained stationary last week, the observing army learns that instead. If the opposing army had been following a particular road, the observing army learns which road.

EXAMPLE: The Judge reveals that the goblin army is marching southwest.

**Number of Divisions**: The observing army learns the number of divisions in the opposing army. This can be valuable intelligence as it hints at the leadership ability of the enemy general, the number of officers available to the opposing army, and the flexibility of its command.

EXAMPLE: The Judge reveals that the goblin army is divided into four divisions.

**Number of Units per Division:** The observing army learns the number of units in each division of the opposing army. This can help identify if some divisions have particularly able commanders, or are particularly strong or weak. The observing army also learns whether the opposing army is organized into company-sized, battalion-sized or brigade-sized units.

EXAMPLE: The Judge reveals that the goblin army’s first division has two battalion-sized units; its second division has three battalion-sized units; its third division has three battalion-sized units; and its fourth division has two battalion-sized units.

**Type of Each Unit:** The observing army learns the type of each unit it has detected, such as heavy infantry, light cavalry, war elephants, and so on. An army of cavalry and heavy infantry is obviously far more threatening than an army of conscripted peasants.

EXAMPLE: Since the elven army only rolled a success, it does not learn the type of each unit. Had the elven army rolled a major success, the Judge would have revealed that the goblin army’s first division consisted of two battalion-sized goblin wolf rider units; its second division has four battalion-sized goblin light infantry units; its third division has three battalion-sized goblin slinger units; and its fourth division has two battalion-sized goblin wolf rider units.

**Strength of Each Unit:** The observing army learns the troop strength of each unit it has detected. This intelligence can be critically valuable as an army might turn out to consist of understrength units.

EXAMPLE: Since the elven army only rolled a success and was not in the same 6-mile hex as the goblin army, it does not learn the strength of each unit. Had the elven army rolled a major success while sharing the same 6-mile hex as the goblin army, the Judge would have revealed that the goblin army’s first division consisted of two goblin wolf rider units of 240 troops each; its second division has four goblin light infantry units of 480 troops each; its third division has three goblin slinger units of 480 troops each; and its fourth division has two goblin wolf rider units of 240 troops each.

**Prisoners:** In some cases, a reconnaissance roll can yield **prisoners**! Prisoners might to be captured deserters, foragers, scouts, or even turncoats. Each prisoner will know 1d3 pieces of information. For each piece of information, roll 1d8 and cross-index the result with the appropriate column on the Prisoner Information table. If the same piece of information is rolled twice, then the information known to the prisoner is of a more detailed nature (shift one column right on the table). The Judge should make these rolls in secret and then decide the identity of the prisoner accordingly.

EXAMPLE: The elven army rolled a success on its reconnaissance roll against the goblin army in its 24-mile hex. According to the Results of Reconnaissance table, the elven army has captured a common prisoner. The Judge secretly rolls 1d3 and scores a 2, so the prisoner will know two pieces of information. He rolls 1d4 for the first piece of information and scores a 1. Cross-indexing a roll of 1 with the “Common Prisoner” column, the Judge finds that the prisoner knows the name, race, and class of the goblin army’s leader. The Judge then rolls 1d4 for the second piece of information and scores another 1. This means the prisoner knows even more on the same topic. The Judge therefore cross-indexes a roll of 1 with the “Valuable Prisoner” column, and finds that the prisoner knows the name, class, approximate level, and description of the goblin army’s leader, and its total number of officers. The Judge decides the prisoner is a goblin wolf rider who was captured by a scouting party while foraging.

When a character interrogates a prisoner, the Judge can role-play the interrogation, and/or secretly roll 2d6 on the Results of Interrogation table. The Judge will modify the roll by the interrogator’s Charisma and applicable proficiencies (e.g. Bribery, Diplomacy, Intimidation, or Seduction), and any other adjustments he deems reasonable.

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Prisoner Information** | | | |
| **1d8** | **Common Prisoner** | **Valuable Prisoner** | **Very Valuable Prisoner** |
| 1 | The name, class, approximate level, and description of the opposing army’s leader. | The name, class, approximate level, and description of the opposing army’s leader; and its total number of officers. | The names, classes, approximate levels, and descriptions of the opposing army’s leader and division commanders; and its total number of officers. |
| 2 | Whether there are any spies infiltrated into friendly army by opposing army. | Whether there are any spies infiltrated into friendly army by opposing army; and if so, the name, class, approximate level, and description of 1 spy. | Whether there are any spies infiltrated into friendly army by opposing army; and if so, the name, class, approximate level, and description of up to 1d4 spies. |
| 3 | Whether the opposing army is in supply. | Whether the opposing army is in supply, and the location of its supply base if so. | Whether the opposing army is in supply, along with the location and description of its supply base and the route of its supply line if so. The description of the supply base includes the supply base’s commander, size, stronghold value, and garrison (if any). |
| 4 | Whether any spellcasters of 7th level or higher are serving in the opposing army. | Whether any spellcasters of 7th level or higher are serving in the opposing army, plus the name, class, and description of the opposing army’s most powerful spellcaster. | The total number of spellcasters of 7th level or higher serving in the opposing army, plus the name, class, approximate level, and description of the opposing army’s most powerful spellcaster. |

| 7 | Type of each unit in opposing army. | Type and strength of each unit in opposing army. | Type and strength of each unit in opposing army as well as its strategic objective. |
| 8 | Judge’s choice of any of the above or other piece of common information | Judge’s choice of any of the above or other piece of valuable information | Judge’s choice of any of the above or another piece of very valuable information |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Results of Interrogation** | |
| **Adjusted Die Roll** | **Result** |
| 2- | False Information |
| 3 – 5 | Nothing |
| 6 – 8 | One piece of information |
| 9 – 11 | Two pieces of information |
| 12+ | All known information |

On a roll of **2 or less**, the prisoner reveals one piece of false information. The Judge should present this information as if it is the result of a successful roll. On a roll of **3 – 5**, the prisoner reveals nothing of value (he may babble incoherently, reveal information already known to the interrogator, or beg for his parents, of course). On a roll of **6 – 8**, the prisoner reveals one piece of information, and on a roll of **9 – 11** the prisoner reveals two pieces of information. On a roll of **12** or more, the prisoner reveals all known information.

Without magic, there is no way for an interrogator to know for sure how many pieces of information a prisoner possesses, or whether the information he has shared is true or false. If magic is available, a prisoner might be **bewitched** into revealing the information, mentally questioned using *telepathy*, and so on.

EXAMPLE: The elven army’s leader has CHA 16 and the Bribery proficiency. He is offering the wolf rider a month’s pay (+3 bonus). The elven army’s leader rolls 2d6 and gets an 8. Adding his CHA bonus of +2 and his Bribery bonus of +3, his adjusted total is 13. This yields an “all known information” result on the Results of Interrogation table. “I don’t know much, but I can tell you about our chieftain, Igrak, and his warband leaders….”

### Stratagems

From time to time, characters may concoct **stratagems** to reconnoiter or scout enemy positions, or slay, deceive or trick enemy scouts. When stratagems are carried out by NPCs, the Judge may simply apply a variable die roll modifier of +1 to +3 (or -1 to -3 to an enemy) to a reconnaissance roll to reflect the stratagem, based on his assessment of the value of the stratagem.

If PCs are personally carrying out the stratagem, the Judge may wish to resolve the stratagem using the **Heroic Forays** rules (p. XX). This would represent skirmishing with enemy scouts, killing enemy foragers, and so on. Each 1/2 point of BR at stake (at the appropriate army scale) should provide a +1 benefit to the army’s reconnaissance roll.

### Hijinks

Once an opposing army has been located, leaders with access to a syndicate (or other source of perpetrators) might wish to order **hijinks** against the army.

Before any hijinks can be performed against an army, a perpetrator must first be infiltrated into the opposing army as a spy. To undertake an infiltration hijink, the perpetrator must be a member of a race present in the opposing army’s troops, or be disguised with a successful Disguise proficiency throw in addition to the hijink throw. The perpetrator must also speak at least one the languages spoken by the opposing army’s troops and be able to wear the armor and weapons of at least one type of troop.

For infiltrating to succeed, the perpetrator must make a successful Hiding throw. For each of the following proficiencies the perpetrator knows, he gains a special +1 bonus on his throw to infiltrate the army: Bribery, Disguise, Manual of Arms. Skulking proficiency grants the usual +2 bonus.

If the proficiency throw succeeds, the perpetrator grants his army’s commander a +1 bonus on reconnaissance rolls made against the opposing army while he remains infiltrated (see p. XX). The infiltrated perpetrator also has the opportunity to conduct assassinating, carousing, sabotaging, slandering, spying, stealing, or subverting hijinks thereafter. A perpetrator can remain infiltrated into the opposing army until caught performing another hijink or exposed by a vagary of war (Judge’s discretion).

If the proficiency throw fails, the perpetrator failed to infiltrate the enemy army. If the proficiency throw fails by 14 or more or is an unmodified 1, the perpetrator has been caught attempting to infiltrate. If a perpetrator is caught attempting to infiltrate an enemy army, the charge is sedition.

Performing hijinks against enemy armies is highly risky. If a perpetrator is caught performing a hijink, very severe charges are always levied against him, and neither attorneys nor interpleaders are available. If the perpetrator is convicted, he will suffer the usual punishments. He will also be interrogated as a **prisoner**. If the perpetrator is 0th – 4th level, he has the information of a common prisoner; if 5th – 9th level, a valuable prisoner; if 10th level or more, a very valuable prisoner. (If the perpetrator is a PC, the Judge might allow the PC to negotiate a trade of information for a reduced sentence…)

Complete rules on syndicates, perpetrators, and hijinks are explained in **Hideouts and** **Hijinks**, p. XX – XX.

## Invading, Conquering, Occupying, and Pillaging Domains

When an army moves into a domain controlled by another leader without his permission, the army is considered to have **invaded** the domain. Invading a domain is the first step towards **occupying, conquering**, and/or **pillaging** it.

When a domain is invaded, it must make an immediate domain morale roll (p. XX). Remember that only that portion of the garrison that is physically present in the domain counts for morale purposes in such cases. If the garrison is off campaigning, this will be detrimental to the domain’s morale. On the other hand, if there is a friendly army from the same realm within the domain, it will count as a garrison for the invaded domain, even if it is not directly under control of the domain’s ruler.

### Occupying Domains

An army has **occupied** a domain when the number of invading troops is sufficiently large enough to constitute an effective garrison without a morale penalty. Large, heavily populated domains are more difficult to occupy than thinly populated ones, although civilized peasants do tend to be more docile than those on the borders.

To determine whether a domain is occupied, calculate the value (in wages/month) of the occupying troops in the domain, and subtract the value (in wages/month) of any of the defending garrison remaining in the domain after any battles have been fought. Divide the difference by the number of peasant families to calculate the **net gp value** of occupying troops per peasant. If the net gp value of occupying troops per peasant is greater than the domain’s garrison cost (2 – 4gp), the domain is occupied. Effectively, if the enemy troops, less any friendly troops, would be enough to garrison the domain without a morale penalty, the domain is occupied.

EXAMPLE: Marcus invades the civilized domain of Sarotem, a small, civilized barony with 500 peasant families. Marcus’s army consists of 100 heavy cavalry (6,000gp wages/month). The domain is only defended with 200 light infantry (1,200gp wages/month). The net gp value of occupying troops per family is (6,000 – 1,200 / 500) is 9.6gp. Marcus has occupied the domain, because 9.6gp exceeds 2gp, the domain’s garrison cost.

Once a domain has been occupied, control over its peasant families and their revenues passes to the occupier, as does responsibility for garrisoning the domain and paying expenses (although tribute will go to the occupier’s lord, not the owner’s lord). Control over urban families does not pass to the occupier until the domain is conquered.

The Judge will calculate a new base morale score for the domain based on the occupier’s personal authority, alignment, garrison, etc. The occupying ruler suffers a penalty to the domain’s current morale score until he conquers the domain. The penalty is equal to the current morale score of the prior ruler at the time of occupation, with a minimum penalty of -1. Should an occupied domain become Turbulent, Defiant, or Rebellious towards the occupier, the rebel peasants will fight to restore the “rightful” owner.

If the owner is able to end the occupation before the domain is conquered, he resumes control over it with the current morale score it had when he last ruled. However, his next domain morale roll suffers a penalty of -1 per month of occupation.

### Conquering Domains

An occupied domain is **conquered** when all strongholds and settlements within it have been captured. A stronghold or settlement is captured when no opposing units are present within. Ungarrisoned strongholds or urban settlements can thus be captured automatically. However, if the strongholds or settlements are garrisoned by troops, then the invading army must besiege them. See Chapter 12, **Sieges**.

When a leader conquers a domain, he can add it to his personal domain if his personal domain is not yet at maximum size. Alternatively the newly conquered domain can be added to the conqueror’s realm, to be ruled by a vassal (or sub-vassal), or can be pillaged (or both). It can even be pillaged until nothing remains…

### Pillaging Domains

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Domain Pillaging Requirements** | | |
| **Domain Size** | **Army**  **Required** | **Time**  **Required** |
| 1 – 500 families | 600 troops | 1 day |
| 501 – 2,500 families | 2,400 troops | 1d3 days |
| 2,501 – 7,500 families | 7,200 troops | 1d4 days |
| 7,500 – 12,500 families | 12,000 troops | 1d6 days |
| 12,501+ families | 24,000 troops | 1d8 days |

Instead of or before integrating a conquered domain into his realm, a leader can **pillage** it. Pillaging a domain requires a sizable force and can take up to a week, but can be exceptionally profitable. See the Domain Pillaging Requirements table for the army size and time required to pillage a domain.

Pillaging a domain yields gold pieces, supplies, and prisoners. Prisoners can be kept as conscript labor, or ransomed or sold for 40gp each. When a domain is pillaged, its population (in families) and its stronghold value or urban investment are reduced. See the Results of Pillaging table, below.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Results of Pillaging** | |
| Gold Plundered | 3d6gp per family |
| Supplies Looted | 1d10 x 5gp per family |
| Prisoners Taken | 1d10 per 10 families |
| Families Lost | 1d10 per 10 families |
| Stronghold Reduction | 1gp per 1gp plundered |

EXAMPLE: Marcus orders his army to pillage the domain. Since Sarotem has 500 families, it takes 1 day to pillage. Marcus plunders 3d6 gp per family; rolling a 13, Marcus plunders (13 x 500) 6,500gp. He loots 1d10 x 5gp in supplies per family; rolling a 5, he loots (5 x 5 x 500) 12,500gp in supplies. He takes 1d10 prisoners per 10 families; rolling a 4, Marcus captures (4 x 500 / 10) 200 prisoners. He ransoms the prisoners off for 40gp each (8,000gp). The total yield from pillaging Sarotem is (6,500 + 12,500 + 8,000) 27,000gp.

If, after pillaging, the remaining stronghold value or urban investment value is too low to sustain the domain’s remaining population, it will lose any excess population when the pillaging ends. A pillaged domain must also make an immediate domain morale roll with a -4 penalty.

EXAMPLE: Sarotem’s population is reduced by 1d10 per 10 families. The 1d10 roll is a 4, so Sarotem loses (4 x 500 / 10) 200 families. It has 300 families remaining. The gp value of Sarotem’s stronghold is also reduced by 6,500gp, the amount of gp plundered. If Sarotem’s stronghold was only 10,000gp to begin with, it would be down to 3,500gp, barely large enough to secure 4 square miles. A 4 square mile domain cannot sustain more than 100 families. The excess 200 families would flee Sarotem when the pillaging was over. (They’d prefer to flee before then, but the presence of the enemy army at their gates makes this hard!)

A domain can be pillaged repeatedly. Each time the effects of the Results of Pillaging table should be applied based on the current size of the domain. Pillaging a domain until nothing remains (“salting the earth”) takes four times the required time, while yielding 20gp in plunder, 50gp in supplies, and 1 prisoner per family in total. The domain is then destroyed and cannot be looted any further.

EXAMPLE: Marcus marches on to Luseatum, a 600 family domain that had rebelled against his authority. He decides to make an example of the domain, and “salts the earth”. After 1d3 x 4 days, Luseatum yields 12,000gp in plunder, 30,000gp in supplies, and 600 prisoners. The domain is destroyed. Future generations use the destruction of Luseatum as a parable against rebellion.

An army too small to pillage a domain can still enjoy some plunder; it just doesn’t do a proper job of it. Roll on the Results of Pillaging table normally, but the gp plundered, supplies looted, and prisoners taken are multiplied by the ratio of units available to units required. Pillaging with a small force still takes the normal time required.

EXAMPLE: 600 orcs are lucky enough to find an unprotected domain with 2,000 families. According to the Domain Pillaging Requirements table, it takes 2400 troops to pillage the domain, but the 600 orcs try anyway! They spend 1d3 days wreaking havoc and then roll on the Results of Pillaging table. The roll yields 20,000gp in plunder, 50,000gp in supplies, and 800 prisoners, which is reduced to (600/2400 = 25%) 5,000gp in plunder, 12,500gp in supplies, and 200 prisoners. Having acquired about 40gp each, the orcs feel rich!

An army that is pillaging a domain cannot move. It can be attacked by an opposing army that moves into the hex it is pillaging. If it is interrupted prior to the completion of pillaging, some pillaging will still have occurred. Again, roll on the Results of Pillaging table normally, but the gp plundered, supplies looted, and prisoners taken is multiplied by the ratio of time spent pillaging to time required. (If a pillaging army is both small and limited in time, then the plunder, loot, and supplies acquired will be reduced proportionately based on both the size of the force and the time spent pillaging.)

Gold and prisoners plundered from pillaging count as **spoils of war** (p. XX) for purposes of experience points. Supplies looted do not count as spoils of war.

### Handling Very Small or Large Domains and Urban Settlements

If a single hex has a mix of small domains with small urban settlements (Class V or Class VI), the Judge should sum the number of families into one value and treat them as a single domain for purposes of invasion, occupation, conquest, and pillage. On the other hand, urban settlements of Class IV or higher should be considered separate domains for purposes of invasion, occupation, conquest, and pillage.

### Pillaging Supply Bases

When the domain or settlement being pillaged is functioning as a supply base, it will yield more than the standard gold, supplies, and prisoners. The pillaging army will gain additional gold equal to one month’s wages for the opposing army, and additional supplies equal to one month’s supply cost for the opposing army.

|  |
| --- |
| The rules assume that gold and supplies are being cached at the supply base in advance and then brought forward to the front line when the troops are fed and paid. The Judge should use his judgment to adjust these rules if the situation does not fit these assumptions. |

EXAMPLE: Marcus pillages the supply base of his arch-rival Moruvai. Moruvai’s army consists of 4 units of goblin wolf riders (900gp wages/month and 3,840gp supplies/month per unit), 5 units of hobgoblin heavy infantry (1,440gp wages/month and 240gp supplies/month per unit), and 5 units of goblin slingers (240gp wages/month and 240gp supplies/month per unit).

Moruvai’s wage cost is [(4 x 900gp) + (5 x 1,440gp) + (5 x 240gp)] 11,800gp per month. Moruvai’s supply cost is [(4 x 3,840gp) + (5 x 240gp) + (5 x 240gp)] 17,760 per month. Therefore Marcus will net 17,760gp in supplies and 11,800gp in gold from pillaging Moruvai’s base.

When an army’s supply base is pillaged, its wages and supply costs for the next month are doubled as its leader must pay for the lost resources. The sack of the supply base counts as a calamity for morale purposes!

# Chapter 11: Battles

When two opposing armies move into the same hex, a **battle** might result. In ***ACKS II****,* battles are resolved either with a streamlined resolution system (provided in this rulebook) or by pitching a battle on a tabletop **battlemap** (discussed in the ***Domains at War: Battles***sourcebook, available separately ). The battle system in this rulebook is intended to quickly resolve engagements between armies commanded by NPC rulers. The system can also be employed for PC-on-NPC battles, or even to pit different PCs against each other, if the Judge prefers a more abstract resolution.

Once the outcome of a battle is resolved, the defeated force may be pursued or **besieged**. The victor will earn the **spoils of war** and have the opportunity to **occupy**, **conquer**,and/or **pillage** the domain of the enemy.

When two opposing armies are in the same 6-mile hex, a **battle** might occur. To determine whether a battle occurs, first the Judge identifies the **state of awareness**. The three possible states are **mutual awareness**, **mutual unawareness**, or **unilateral awareness**.

The state of awareness depends on whether the various armies have located each other through reconnaissance rolls. If both armies have located each other, the state is one of **mutual awareness**. If neither army has located the other, the state is one of **mutual unawareness**. If just one army has located the other, the state is **unilateral awareness**.

Once the state of awareness is known, the Judge finds the appropriate **State of Awareness** table, below. Cross index the two army’s **strategic stances** (p. XX) to find the resulting **strategic situation**. Some strategic situations will result in a battle.

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Mutual Awareness** | | | |
| **Army A’s** | **Army B’s Stance** | | |
| **Stance** | *Offensive* | *Defensive* | *Evasive* |
| *Offensive* | Pitched Battle | Pitched Battle | Rear Guard Action |
| *Defensive* | Pitched Battle | No Battle | No Battle |
| *Evasive* | Rear Guard Action | No Battle | No Battle |

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Mutual Unawareness** | | | |
| **Army A’s** | **Army B’s Stance** | | |
| **Stance** | *Offensive* | *Defensive* | *Evasive* |
| *Offensive* | Meeting Engagement | Meeting Engagement | Skirmish |
| *Defensive* | Meeting Engagement | No Battle | No Battle |
| *Evasive* | Skirmish | No Battle | No Battle |

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Unilateral Awareness** | | | |
| **Army A’s** | **Army B’s Stance (Unaware)** | | |
| **Stance (Aware)** | *Offensive* | *Defensive* | *Evasive* |
| *Offensive* | Deep Envelopment | Envelopment | Rear Guard Envelopment |
| *Defensive* | Ambush | No Battle | No Battle |
| *Evasive* | No Battle | No Battle | No Battle |

Note that when indexing results on the tables above, the two opposing armies are always designated “Army A” and “Army B.” In states of mutual awareness and mutual unawareness, the designation is arbitrary. In states of unilateral awareness, the aware army is Army A, and the unaware army is Army B.

## Strategic Situations

The State of Awareness tables will yield one of several different strategic situations. The strategic situation determines whether a battle is fought; and if so, which divisions of the armies may participate in the fight, and whether either army is surprised.

**No Battle:** No battle occurs. The two armies may each continue to move when they are next active.

**Pitched Battle:** A pitched battle occurs when the two armies meet on a mutually agreed battlefield, fully deployed. Every division from each army participates in the battle. Neither army is surprised.

**Meeting Engagement:** A meeting engagement pits the vanguard divisions of one army against the vanguard divisions of the other army. Neither army is surprised. Only units from each army’s vanguard can be deployed before the first battle turn.

**Rear Guard Action:** A rear guard action pits every division of an offensive army against the rear guard divisions of an evading army. Neither army is surprised. Only units from the evading army’s rear guard can be deployed before the first battle turn.

**Skirmish:** A skirmish pits the vanguard divisions of an offensive army against the rear guard divisions of an evading army. Neither army is surprised. Only units from the attacking army’s vanguard and the defending army’s rear guard can be deployed before the first battle turn.

**Ambush:** An ambush occurs when an unaware army on the march is surprised by a fully deployed and ready army to its front. Every division from each army participates in the battle, but the unaware army is surprised. An ambushing army always counts as an attacking army for purposes of army size symmetry (see p. XX), so if it is smaller than the enemy it can attack before they are fully deployed.

**Envelopment:** An envelopment occurs when an army deployed for defense is surprised by an attack by an offensive army on its front and flank. Every division from each army participates in the battle.

**Deep Envelopment:** A deep envelopment occurs when an offensive army is surprised by an attack by an opposing army on its front and rear. Every division from each army participates in the battle.

**Rear Guard Envelopment:** A rear guard envelopment occurs when an army’s rear guard divisions, deployed to cover an evasion, are surprised by an attack by an opposing army on its front and flank. Every division from the opposing army participates.

Units that are unable to be deployed before the first battle turn can later join the battle as reinforcements (see p. XX).

On any result other than **No Battle***,* the Judge can resolve the battle using the rules below. Alternatively, the Judge can use the more detailed rules available in ***Domains at War: Battles***to fight the battle on the tabletop*.*

## Running a Battle

### Gathering the Units

Make a counter or marker for each unit in each participating division in the battle. You can use the official ***Domains at War: Troops & Terrain*** counters or use figures or scratch paper. Group the units into their divisions and be sure to mark which unit the general and the division commander is with, as well as any lieutenants or other heroes (p. XX). Use figures to represent the officers and heroes.

Some of the units might be **missile units** or **loose units.** To count as a missile unit, the unit must be:

1. Equipped with arbalests, crossbows, composite bows, long bows, short bows, staff-slings, or slings; or
2. Made up of spellcasters capable of casting at least three offensive mass combat spells with a range of at least 120’; or
3. Made up of monsters with a special attack with a range of at least 120’; or

To count as a loose unit, the unit must be:

1. Human or demi-human light infantry equipped with arbalests, crossbows, composite bows, long bows, short bows, staff-slings, slings, 3 or more javelins, or 5 or more darts; or
2. Human or demi-human light cavalry or horse archers equipped with crossbows, composite bows, short bows, or 3 or more javelins.
3. If using ***D@W: Battles****,* any LF, LM, or FLY units.

Mark which units are missile and loose on the counter or scratch paper.

###### Battlefield Artillery Units

Artillery units are only rarely deployed in battle, being primarily reserved for sieges and assaults (p. XX). However, if an army has artillery ready for use, it can use them in the battle. They are organized into units with BR as for an assault (p. XX), but act as missile units and fire in the missile phase. They do not get a separate Artillery Phase as they cannot take advantage of their full range.

### Calculating the Battle Ratings

A unit’s **battle rating (BR)** is a measure of its value on the battlefield. An army’s BR is equal to the sum of the battle ratings of all the units in the army, rounded down. The battle ratings of the default units for the major races are listed in the Battle Rating table, below. The **Unit Characteristics Summaries** (p. XX) have battle ratings for many additional unit types.

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Troop Type** | *Man* | *Dwarf* | *Elf* | *Kobold* | *Goblin* | *Orc* | *Hobgoblin* | *Gnoll* | *Lizardman* | *Bugbear* | *Ogre* |
| Conscript/Militia | 0.5 | 0.5 | 1 | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - |
| Light Infantry | 1 | - | 1.5 | 0.25 | 0.5 | 1 | 2 | 2.5 | 4 | 5.5 | 7.5 |
| Heavy Infantry | 2 | 3 | 4 | - | - | 1.5 | 3 | 3.5 | 6 | 7 | 12 |
| Slinger | 1 | - | - | - | 0.5 | - | - | - | - | - | - |
| Bowman | 1.5 | - | 4 | - | 0.5 | 1.5 | - | - | - | - | - |
| Crossbowman | 3 | 3.5 | - | - | - | 2 | - | - | - | - | - |
| Longbowman | 3 | - | 6 | - | - | - | 4.5 | 5.5 | - | - | - |
| Light Cavalry | 3 | - | 6.5 | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - |
| Horse Archers | 5 | - | 8.5 | - | - | - | 6.5 | - | - | - | - |
| Medium Cavalry | 4 | - | - | - | - | - | 7 | - | - | - | - |
| Heavy Cavalry | 6 | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - |
| Cataphract Cavalry | 8 | - | 12.5 | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - |
| Camel Archers | 2.5 | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - |
| Camel Lancers | 3.5 | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - |
| War Elephants | 3.5 | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - |
| Mounted Crossbowman | - | 5 | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - |
| Beast Rider | - | - | - | - | 7 | 9 | - | - | - | - | - |

EXAMPLE: Moruvai has an army consisting of 20 units of goblin bowmen (BR 0.5 each), 4 units of goblin wolf riders (BR 6.5 each), and 5 units of ogre light infantry (BR 4 each). Moruvai’s army has a battle rating of [(20 x 0.5) + (4 x 6.5) + (5 x 4)] 56.

###### Battle Scale

The battle ratings are for company-sized units. If one army has units at a larger scale than the other, increase the larger units’ BR proportionately or split them into smaller units. See **Organization and Command in Very Small or Very Large Armies** (p. XX).

EXAMPLE: Among the forces facing Moruvai’s army are a battalion-sized unit of 480 elven longbowmen. Since a company-sized unit of 120 elven longbowmen has BR 7, a battalion-sized unit of 480 elven longbowmen would have BR 28. Alternatively, the elven longbow battalion could be split into four company-sized units of 120 troops, each with BR 7.

If both armies are organized into small- or large-scale units of the same size, use the BRs at the standard value. This allows you to quickly fight very large battles with the standard BR values.

EXAMPLE #1: A large dwarven army (6 brigade-sized units of 1,080 heavy infantry) is battling a huge goblin army (18 brigade-sized units of 1,080 bowmen). Rather than scale BR upward by a factor of 16, the Judge simply assigns the standard BR value to the larger units. Therefore the dwarven army has 6 units with a battle rating of 3 each while the goblin army has 18 units with a battle rating of 0.5 each.

EXAMPLE #2: A caravan of nomads (6 platoon-sized units of horse archers) are facing a village of goblins (8 platoon-sized units of goblin light infantry). The Judge assigns the standard BR value to the smaller units. Therefore the nomad “army” has 6 units with a BR of 5 each, while the goblin army has 8 units with a battle rating of 0.5 each.

The battles system works best if both armies have at least 6 units. If either army has fewer than 6 units, reduce the scale by one step or split up the higher BR units into a number of partial units.

EXAMPLE #1: 9 companies of light infantry (BR 1 each, 9 total) are confronting two companies of goblin wolf riders (BR 7 each, 14 total). The Judge decides to run the fight at platoon scale, so it will be 36 platoons of light infantry versus 8 platoons of wolf riders. The BR values of the two armies are now 36 BR for 56 BR.

EXAMPLE #2: 12 platoons of militia (BR 0.5 each, 6 BR total) face one platoon of ogre heavy infantry (BR 12). The Judge splits the ogre unit into 12 partial units of 1 BR each.

###### Strategic Ability of Commanders

A commander of great **strategic ability** (p. XX) increases the BR of the units in his division. At strategic ability +3 or better, each unit’s BR is increased by 0.5. At strategic ability +5 or better, each unit’s BR is increased by 1.0.

EXAMPLE: 4 longbowmen are led by a captain with strategic ability +3. Their total battle rating is (4) x (3 + 0.5) 14.

### Setting Up the Battlefield

Next, on a battlemat or large sheet of paper, divide the battlefield into a Left, Center, Right, and Reserve zones for Army A and Army B, as shown.

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Army B Reserve | | |
| Army B Right | Army B Center | Army B Left |
| Army A Left | Army A Center | Army A Right |
| Army A Reserve | | |

Each side now deploys its army. In a pitched battle, meeting engagement, rear guard action, and skirmish, the two sides deploy secretly. In an ambush, envelopment, deep envelopment, and rear guard envelopment, the surprised side deploys first publicly and then the opponent deploys.

Side A is the attacking army. If both armies have an offensive strategic stance, there may not be a clear defender. Use the following guidelines to determine which is the defending army:.

1. If one of the two armies is surprised, it is the defending army.
2. If both armies are aware of each other, the army that arrived in the hex first can choose whether to be the attacking or defending army.
3. If both armies are aware of each other and both armies arrived in the hex simultaneously, then the smaller of the two can choose whether to be the attacking or defending army.

When deploying, the following rules apply:

* Each army must assign commanders (one of whom can be the general) to the command of its Right, Center, and Left zones. If the army has fewer than three commanders, one or more commanders must command two or three zones. If the army has more than three commanders, the additional commanders can be added as subordinate commanders to a zone. Subordinate commanders add their Leadership Ability to the zone commander’s for purposes of deployment and redeployment.
* Each commander can deploy some or all of his troops in the zone he commands, up to a maximum number of units equal to his Leadership Ability. However, in an Envelopment or Rear Guard Envelopment, the surprised side cannot deploy any troops in its Right Zone. In a Deep Envelopment, the surprised side cannot deploy any troops in its Left or Right Zone.
* Each commander’s unit must be deployed in one of the zones he commands or in the Reserve.
* Any units not deployed in the Right, Center, or Left Zones are deployed into the Reserve zone.
* Heroes that are not commanding or leading units can be deployed in any zone.

###### Effects of Army Size Asymmetry (Optional)

When attacking, smaller armies with fewer units can finish deploying all of their units faster than larger armies can. Generals willing to go on the offensive against a larger force can take advantage of this asymmetry.

An attacking army that is smaller than the defending army can begin fighting the battle as soon as it finishes deploying, without waiting for the defending army to finish deploying. When the battle begins, the attacking army can deploy all of the units it has available based on the strategic situation, while the defending army can only deploy a number of units equal to the number of units the attacking army has deployed. The other units can later join the battle as reinforcements (see p. XX).

EXAMPLE: An army of 4 light cavalry battalions is attacking an army of 7 heavy infantry battalions in a pitched battle. The attacking general decides to begin fighting as soon his cavalry is deployed. Therefore, the defending army can only deploy of its battalions before the first battle turn.

**Designer’s Note:** Judges sometimes use the battles system to handle fights between adventurer-led mercenaries and powerful monsters in the wilderness. In such cases, we strongly advise that these rules be used so that the monsters can exploit the asymmetry in force size. For instance, if a unit of wyverns observes 16 units of bowmen advancing, the wyverns will not wait for the entire army to deploy in neat files to assail them with arrows to attack them, but will instead immediately attack the head of the column.

### Fighting the Battle

When a battle occurs, the Judge should run a series of **battle turns** following the procedure below. Each battle turn represents approximately 10 minutes of hard fighting. For purposes of battle turns, the first zone refers to Army A’s Right zone and Army B’s Left zone; the second zone is Army A and B’s Center zones; and the third zone is Army A’s Left zone and Army B’s Right zone.

1. **First Zone Missile Phase.** In this phase, the missile troops in the first zones exchange fire.
   1. Calculate Battle Ratings.Each army leader sums the battle rating of all missile units in the zone.
   2. Make Heroic Forays. Heroic PCs and NPCs in the zone can now make **heroic forays** at missile range to influence the battle rating in favor of one army or the other. All heroes’ heroic forays are revealed and resolved simultaneously. Lost units are then removed.
   3. Determine Hits.Each army leader simultaneously rolls a number of attack throws equal to the battle rating of the missile unit that remain in the zone. The target value for the attack throws is 17+, modified by the Attack Throw Modifiers listed below. For each successful attack throw, one hit is scored. If at the start of step c, one side has no units in its zone, see **Breaking a Zone** (p. XX).
   4. Apply Casualties.Each army leader tallies the hits scored against his army. Each army leader then removes units from the first zone with a combined battle rating equal to or greater than the total hits scored against his army. The units removed do not need to be missile units. These units are destroyed (or, if loose units, **withdrawn**; see below). If all of an army’s units in a zone are defeated, the remaining hits are lost. Hits are applied simultaneously.
2. **First Zone Melee Phase.** The surviving units in the first zone now clash as the opposing battlelines come to melee.
   1. Calculate Battle Ratings.Each army leader sums the battle rating of all non-missile units in the zone.
   2. Make Heroic Forays*.* Heroic PCs and NPCs in the zone who did not foray in the Missile Phase can now make **heroic forays** at melee range to influence the battle rating in favor of one army or the other. All heroes’ heroic forays are revealed and resolved simultaneously. Lost units are then removed.
   3. Determine Hits.Each army leader simultaneously rolls a number of attack throws equal to the battle rating of he non-missile unit that remain in the zone. The target value for the attack throws is 16+, modified by the Attack Throw Modifiers listed below. For each successful attack throw, one hit is scored. If at the start of step c, one side has no units in its zone, see **Breaking a Zone** (p. XX).
   4. Apply Casualties.Each army leader tallies the hits scored against his army. Each army leader then removes units from the first zone with a combined battle rating equal to or greater than the total hits scored against his army. The units removed do not need to be non-missile units. These units are destroyed (or, if loose units, **withdrawn**; see below). If all of an army’s units in a zone are defeated, the remaining hits are lost. Hits are applied simultaneously.
3. **Second Zone Missile Phase.** Play proceeds through steps A – D above.
4. **Second Zone Melee Phase.** Play proceeds through steps A – D above.
5. **Third Zone Missile Phase.** Play proceeds through steps A – D above.
6. **Third Zone Melee Phase.** Play proceeds through steps A – D above.
7. **Morale Phase.** The Judge now checks to see whether either army has reached a **break point** and if so resolves **morale rolls**, as explained in **Ending Battles** (p. XX). If, after resolving morale, all units of one army have routed or been defeated, the battle ends.
8. **Redeployment Phase.** Either army can now **redeploy** units. The army leader with the lower strategic ability must redeploy first. (If equal, Army B must decide first.) The army leader can redeploy a number of units equal to his Leadership Ability. A redeployed infantry unit can be moved from the Left, Center, or Right zone to the Reserve zone, or from the Reserve Zone to the Left, Center, or Right zone. A redeployed cavalry unit can be moved from any zone to another zone. Wavering and disordered units cannot be redeployed. In lieu of redeploying a unit or units, leader can **regroup** a unit or units that have **wavered** or become **disordered**, ending those conditions. Heroes can move from any zone to another zone and do not count against the leader’s Leadership Ability. The maximum number of units, other than heroes, in a zone cannot exceed the zone commander’s Leadership Ability (including subordinates, if any).
9. **Reinforcement Phase**. If an army began the battle with one or more units it was unable to deploy (either due to the strategic situation or because a small attacking army began fighting before deployment was complete), the army leader can attempt to deploy reinforcements by making a proficiency throw modified by his strategic ability. The target value is 4+ if the battle is in grasslands or shrublands terrain, 12+ in barrens, desert, or hills terrain, and 16+ in forest, jungle, mountains, or swamp terrain. If the throw succeeds, the army leader can deploy one previously-undeployed unit into his army’s reserve. The army leader with the lower strategic ability must choose and roll. (If equal, Army B must decide first.)
10. **Withdrawal Phase.** Either army may now **voluntarily withdraw**. The army leader with the lower strategic ability must decide first. (If equal, Army A must decide first.) If either army voluntarily withdraws, the battle ends. If neither army wishes to withdraw, then run another battle turn.

When the battle ends, the losing army must **retreat**. The winning army may **pursue** the defeated army. After pursuit, **casualties** are calculated. The winning army then seizes the **spoils of war**. See the **Aftermath of Battles** section (p. XX).

###### Attack Throw Modifiers

During a battle, each unit’s attack throws are modified by the following mass combat factors:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Attack Throw Modifiers** | **Modifier** |
| Commander or Lieutenant personally leading unit | +1 |
| Unit facing broken zone | +2 |
| Opposing army surprised (first battle turn only) | +2 |
| Opposing army occupies advantageous terrain (hill, ridgeline) | -2 |

Units that are affected by conditions that modify their attack throws (such as **blessed** or **hungry**) should also apply those modifiers.

###### Breaking a Zone

If, at the start of any step (c), **Determine Hits***,* a zone has no friendly units in it, that zone is **broken**. Units facing a broken zone gain a +2 bonus to their attack throws. Hits scored against the broken zone can be applied to the enemy units in an adjacent zone. Units facing a broken Left or Right zone can apply their hits to the enemy’s Center zone, while units facing a broken Center zone apply some or all of their hits to the enemy’s Left, Right, or Reserve zone. Loose units cannot withdraw if attacked in the Reserve.

###### Surprise

In certain strategic situations (e.g. ambush, envelopment, deep envelopment, and rear guard envelopment), one army will have surprised the other. The surprised army cannot make any attack throws during the first battle turn of the battle. In addition, units attacking the surprised army gain a +2 bonus on all attack throws against it during the first battle turn. Heroes may still make a heroic foray even if their army is surprised. See **Heroes in Battle**, below.

###### Withdrawal

Loose units aren’t deployed to hold ground or fight to the last man. When applying hits to his units, the army leader will count loose units as having only half their BR. However, instead of being killed, the units withdraw to the reserve, where they become **disordered**. Place the unit in the reserve and mark it with a token to represent its disordered state. A disordered unit cannot be redeployed until it is rallied. A unit cannot be rallied and redeployed in the same battle turn.

### Heroes in Battle

Great warriors, powerful wizards, and monstrous creatures can influence the outcome of battles far more than lesser mortals. ***ACKS II*** offers two mechanisms by which the actions of **heroes** on the battlefield can be resolved. Heroes can be treated as **heroic units**, with their activities abstracted into Battle Ratings. Alternatively, the activities of heroes can be resolved by “zooming in” on a particular fight between the heroes and their foes, called a **heroic foray**.

###### Qualifying Heroes

To qualify as a hero, a PC, NPC, or monster must be present at the battlefield and meet one of the following criteria:

* The character is a PC (i.e. all player characters can act as heroes); or
* The character is a monster possessing at least nine Hit Dice; or
* The character is an NPC with at least six levels of experience; or
* The character is the henchman of a qualifying hero, and has at least four levels of experience; or
* The character has certain special abilities or items such that the Judge feels the character qualifies as a hero.

EXAMPLE: Several PCs and NPCs are present at a battle: Marcus (9th level PC fighter) and his henchman Peristo (6th level fighter); Zeodarë (7th level PC bladedancer) and her henchman Sera (3rd level thief); and Theon (5th level NPC Paladin) and his henchman Jonus (4th level paladin).

Marcus and Zeodarë both qualify as heroes because they are PCs. Peristo qualifies as a hero because he is the henchman of a qualifying hero and has at least four levels of experience, but Sera does not qualify because she is too low level. Theon does not qualify as a hero because as an NPC he needs at least six levels of experience, and he only has five. His henchman Jonus does not qualify because Theon didn’t qualify. If Jonus were Marcus’ or Zeodarë’s henchman, he would qualify as a hero.

In platoon-scale battles, decrease the level or HD requirements by two. In battalion-scale battles, increase the level or HD requirements by two. In brigade-scale battles, increase them by four. (Remember: Just because PCs canact as heroes, doesn’t mean they should!)

EXAMPLE: If the battle above were at platoon scale, NPCs would qualify with five levels of experience, and henchmen of qualifying heroes would qualify with two levels of experience. Therefore Sera, Theon, and Jonus would all qualify as heroes.

###### Heroic Units

Heroes can be treated as **heroic units**, with their activities abstracted into Battle Ratings. When using this method, heroes simply become (powerful) units on the battlefield. Treating heroes as units allows the Judge to quickly resolve battles, and is ideal for resolving mass combats that happen without player participation. Simply calculate each hero’s or party’s BR using the formula below. Treat classed PCs and NPCs as having one special ability (\*) each, or two if they cast arcane spells. Add additional special abilities for powerful magic items.

(Number of Creatures) x (Creature’s AC + 1) x (Creature’s HD) x (Creature’s HD + 1) x (1 + Creature’s # of Special Abilities) /

(8 x # of Infantry per Regular Unit)

EXAMPLE #5: Peristo, a 6th level fighter with AC 9 and a **horn of blasting**,participates in a battle. The Judge determines that possessing the **horn** counts as a bonus special ability. Peristo’s BR is (1) x (9+1) x (6) x (6+1) x (1+2) / (8 x 120) = 1.3, rounded to 1.5. Without the **horn of blasting**, Peristo’s BR would be (1) x (9+1) x (6) x (6+1) (1+1) / (8 x 120) = 0.875, rounded to 1.

###### Heroic Forays

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **BR Staked** | **Hero is …** |
| 0 | Entering the foray |
| 0.5 | Leading from the front |
| 1 | Heroically charging into battle |
| 1.5 | Attacking in front of the vanguard |
| 2 | Cutting a swath of glory |
| 2.5 | Carving his name into the epics |
| 3 | Seeking glorious death! |

Instead of treating heroes as units, the activities of heroes can be resolved by “zooming in” on a **heroic foray**. A heroic foray is a fight between participating heroes and a selection of foes drawn from the opposing army. All heroes foraying in the same step fight in the same foray. Heroes foraying on different steps fight in separate forays, even if in the same zone. Heroes can only fight in one foray each battle turn.

To foray, a hero **stakes** between 0 and 3 points of battle rating. The amount of BR staked represents the risk the hero is taking during the battle. Each hero chooses how many points of battle rating he will stake. The total amount of BR staked by all the heroes in the foray will determine how many foes the heroes face.

EXAMPLE: Marcus and Peristo are in the Center zone. On step 4b, they decide to foray against Moruvai’s army. Marcus audaciously stakes 2 point of BR, while Peristo, more cautious by nature, stakes 1 point. They will collectively face 3 BR worth of foes.

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Terrain Type** | **Missile Encounter Distance** | **Melee Encounter Distance** |
| Barrens (any) | 4d6x30’ (420’) | 2d6+1 x 15’ (120’) |
| Desert (rocky) | 5d6x30’ (480’) | 2d6+1 x 15’ (120’) |
| Desert (sandy) | 5d6x30’ (480’) | 2d6+1 x 15’ (120’) |
| Forest (taiga) | 3d6x15’ (157’) | 2d6+1 x 15’ (120’) |
| Forest (deciduous) | 5d8x3’ (70’) | 5d8x3’ (70’) |
| Grassland (farmland/prairie) | 4d6x30’ (420’) | 2d6+1 x 15’ (120’) |
| Grassland (steppe) | 5d6x30’ (480’) | 2d6+1 x 15’ (120’) |
| Hills (forested) | 5d8x3’ (70’) | 5d8x3’ (70’) |
| Hills (rocky/terraced) | 4d6x30’ (420’) | 2d6+1 x 15’ (120’) |
| Jungle (any) | 5d8x3’ (70’) | 5d4x3’ (38’) |
| Mountains (forested) | 5d8x3’ (70’) | 5d8x3’ (70’) |
| Mountains (rocky/terraced) | 4d6x30’ (420’) | 2d6+1 x 15’ (120’) |
| Scrubland (low, sparse) | 4d6x30’ (420’) | 2d6+1 x 15’ (120’) |
| Scrubland (high, dense) | 3d6x15’ (157’) | 2d6+1 x 15’ (120’) |
| Swamp (marshy) | 3d6x15’ (157’) | 2d6+1 x 15’ (120’) |
| Swamp (scrubby) | 5d8x3’ (70’) | 5d8x3’ (70’) |

The Judge should select foes for the foray from among the units and heroes present in the zone. Forays by heroes during a Missile Phase should face missile units, if any are available. Foes enter the foray in 1 – 4 separate groups.

The Judge should allocate foes to the groups however he deems appropriate, but each group should be approximately equal in size.

If desired, the Judge may have the heroes face partial units, reducing both BR and number of creatures proportionately.

EXAMPLE: The Judge selects 3 BR worth of foes. A unit of 60 wolf riders has 6.5 BR, so the Judge confronts Marcus and Peristo with 45% of that number — 27 wolf riders, equal to BR 3. The Judge divides the wolf riders into three groups of 9 wolf riders each.

When the foray begins, consult the Battlefield Encounter Distance table to determine how many feet separate the heroes and their foes. Roll separately for each group. Forays during a missile phases begin at longer ranges than forays during a melee phase.

EXAMPLE: The Judge consults the Battlefield Encounter Distance table for each group. The battle is taking in steppe and the foray is occurring during a melee phase, so the grasslands (steppe) melee encounter distance is used. The Judge rolls 2d6+1 x 15’ for each group. Rolling for the first group of 4 wolf riders, the Judge gets a 7; the first group is 105’ away from the heroes. Rolling for the second group of wolf riders, the Judge gets an 11; the second group is 165’ away from the heroes. Rolling for the third group of wolf riders, the Judge gets a 5; the third group is 75’ away.

The foray between the heroes and their foes should be resolved using the standard combat rules of ***ACKS***(initiative, morale, etc.).The participating heroes may use any desired spells, magic items, or other powers they wish. The heroes may leave the foray by using defensive movement, but cannot re-enter the same foray thereafter. The foray ends after 10 rounds or when all of the heroes or foes have been defeated, whichever occurs first. Foes who voluntarily withdraw or who fail morale rolls and flee are considered defeated.

After the foray, the opposing army loses units with a combined battle rating equal to the total BR their side lost in the foray. If they defeated every creature, the opposing army loses the total BR staked in the foray.

EXAMPLE: Marcus and Peristo kill half the goblin wolf riders, and the remaining goblins fail their morale rolls and flee. All of the foes are defeated, so the foray is over. The heroes won a foray with 3 BR at stake, so the Judge must removes 3 BR worth of units from the goblin army at the end of the step.

###### Heroes versus Heroes

If there are heroes present in opposing zones, and they end up foraying during the same step, then the heroes of each army face each other in the foray. The highest total BR staked by either side is used. The heroes from each army will be supported by the staked BR worth of allies drawn from their army.

EXAMPLE: Next battle turn, Marcus and Peristo foray again in step 4b, putting 2 BR at stake in total. Simultaneously, Moruvai, a 12th level ruinguard who is in his army’s Center zone, also forays. Moruvai puts 3 BR at stake. The highest stake risked by either side is used, so 3 BR are at stake. Marcus and Peristo will face Moruvai in the foray. Each side will be supported by 3 BR worth of allies from their own army.

A foray with heroes on both sides ends after 10 rounds or when all of the heroes and creatures on one side have been defeated. Each side loses units with a combined battle rating equal to the total BR their side lost in the foray.

EXAMPLE: After a fierce fight, with many losses on both sides, Moruvai withdraws. He has lost 6 goblin bow units (0.5 BR each) in the fighting. Marcus and Peristo are victorious, though their side has lost 1 heavy infantry unit (2 BR). Moruvai’s army loses 3 BR worth of units, and Marcus’s army loses 2 BR.

###### Lulls in the Fighting

After each battle turn in which heroes foray, there is a **lull in the fighting** during which PC and NPC heroes can treat incapacitated comrades, use magical healing, or take other actions to prepare themselves for the next battle turn. If not interrupted, the lull will last for 1 turn (10 minutes). However, if heroes from either army make any attacks or cast any spells affecting the opposing army, however, this immediately interrupts the lull and begins another battle turn. When this occurs, any heroes that remain incapacitated and untreated are “left on the battlefield”; their mortal wounds will be resolved later using the rolls for officer casualties (p. XX).

## Ending Battles

A battle ends when all of the units of one army have voluntarily withdrawn, routed, and/or been destroyed.

### Annihilation

A battle immediately ends if all of the units of either army are destroyed. Such an outcome is rare unless the army’s leader has a very high morale modifier. In most cases, a battle will end from voluntary withdrawal or rout long before this occurs.

### Voluntary Withdrawal

A battle immediately ends if either of the armies **voluntarily withdraws**. Armies which suffer a morale collapse are very vulnerable to pursuit, so a wise leader will conduct a voluntary withdrawal before this occurs.

### Morale Collapse

Armies do not, as a rule, fight to the last man (or elf, or orc). Instead they suffer a gradual loss of morale, becoming increasingly disordered as casualties mount, until eventually the army is swept away in a rout. These effects are simulated with **morale rolls**.

During the Morale Phase, every unit in an army must make a morale roll if:

* One or more units in the army were destroyed or disordered during the preceding combat round; and
* The total number of units destroyed in the battle thus far plus the number of units that are currently disordered is equal to or greater than the army’s **break point.** An army’s break point is always 1/3 of the army’s starting number of units, rounded up.

EXAMPLE: Marcus began the battle with an army of 12 units. The army’s break point is (1/3 x 12) 4. During the preceding battle turn, Marcus’s army lost its fourth unit. Since at least one unit was destroyed during the preceding battle turn, and the total number of units destroyed (4) is equal to or greater than the army’s break point, every unit in Marcus’s army must make a morale roll.

### Morale Rolls

To make a morale roll, the unit’s commander rolls 2d6, adds the unit’s morale score, and consults the Unit Morale table. The die roll should be modified based on the army and unit modifiers listed on the Morale Roll Modifiers table below.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Unit Morale** | |
| **Adjusted Die Roll** | **Result** |
| 2- | Rout |
| 3 – 5 | Flee |
| 6 – 8 | Waver |
| 9 – 11 | Stand Firm |
| 12+ | Rally |

**Rout:** The unit immediately **routs** off the battlefield. It will play no further part in the battle, and counts as destroyed for battle resolution purposes.

**Flee:** The unit retreats in disorder. It is moved into the reserve and marked as disordered. It cannot be redeployed until rallied. If the battle ends before the unit is rallied, it counts as routed.

**Waver:** The unit’s morale is wavering. Its BR is halved when attacking. If in the reserve, it cannot be redeployed until reformed.

**Stand Firm:** The unit remains steady. No effect.

**Rally**: The unit rallies under the pressure of battle. Its BR is increased by half when attacking next battle turn. If disordered or wavering, those conditions expire.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Morale Roll Modifiers** | **Modifier** |
| *Army Modifiers (apply to all units)* |  |
| Army leader present on battlefield | +1/2 Morale Modifier (round up) |
| Army has lost 1/2 or more of its starting units, but less than 2/3 | -2 |
| Army has lost 2/3 or more of its starting units | -5 |
| Army has destroyed more units than opposing army | +2 |
| Army has lost more units than opposing army | -2 |
| Army cannot retreat (surrounded, trapped, etc.) | +2 |
| Army defending homeland / sacred ground | Judge’s Discretion |
| *Unit Modifiers* |  |
| Commander attached to unit | + Morale Modifier |
| Unit is wavering or disordered | -2 |
| Unit is adjacent to a broken zone | -2 |

The army’s general determines the order in which his units will make morale rolls. The effects of each morale roll are resolved before rolling for the next unit. It is possible for the results of earlier morale rolls to impact those of later rolls, causing a cascade of flight off the battlefield.

EXAMPLE: Since a unit was destroyed during the preceding battle turn, and the total number of units destroyed is equal to or greater than his army’s break point, every unit in Marcus’s army must make a morale roll.

Marcus’s morale modifier is a confident +5. His army gains a bonus of 1/2 that, or +3. His army has lost 1/3 of its starting units, which imposes no modifier. However, his army has lost more units than the opposing army, which imposes a -2 penalty. The total army modifier is therefore +1.

The first unit is a unit of heavy infantry (morale score 0). Marcus rolls 2d6 and gets a 6, modified to a 7. The unit is wavering. Its BR will be halved from 2 to 1 when attacking next turn.

## Aftermath of Battles

When a battle ends, the defeated army immediately **retreats**. The victorious army has the opportunity to **pursue** the defeated army. After pursuit is resolved, each army determines **casualties** and gathers the **spoils of war**. Finally, each army calculates **experience points** for its leaders, heroes, and troops.

An army that fights a battle cannot make any further movement that day, apart from retreating.

### Retreat

After a battle, the defeated army must retreat. A retreating army generally retreats 1 6-mile hex along its line of supply. If there is a friendly stronghold or urban settlement in the same 6-mile hex, the army may retreat into the stronghold or settlement. The victorious army might then begin a **siege**, as described in Chapter 5.

If an army’s line of supply is occupied by enemy troops, the army may choose to retreat into an adjacent empty hex (risking loss of supply), or it may retreat along its line of supply (risking a second battle with enemy troops, if they detect the retreating army).

### Pursuit

As the defeated army retreats, the victorious army is eligible to **pursue**. Pursuit is handled with a series of **pursuit throws**. The victorious army receives one pursuit throw per **eligible** pursuing unit. Pursuing occurs within the same 6-mile hex that the battle took place in. The pursuing army does not follow the retreating army into its new hex.

###### Pursuit Eligibility

Determine which units from the victorious army are eligible to pursue as follows:

1. Did the defeated army end the battle without any cavalry or flyer units (i.e. all such units were routed or destroyed)? If yes, then all units in the victorious army are eligible to pursue.
2. In all other cases, only cavalry and flying units in the victorious army are eligible to pursue.

EXAMPLE #1: A battle between Army A and Army B ended when all of Army B’s units were destroyed or routed. Army A had eight heavy infantry and four light cavalry units remaining when the battle ended. Army B had two light cavalry and four light infantry remaining, but all routed. Because Army B ended the battle with all of its cavalry units routed, Army A is eligible to pursue with all of its units.

EXAMPLE #2: A battle between Army A and Army B ended when Army B voluntarily withdrew from the battle. Army A had eight heavy infantry and four light cavalry units remaining when the battle ended. Army B had two light cavalry and four light infantry remaining, all of which voluntarily retreated. Because Army B still has unrouted cavalry units in its army, Army A is eligible to pursue with onlyits four light cavalry.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Pursuing Unit** | **Pursuit Throw** |
| Light Cavalry or Flyer | 11+ |
| Other Cavalry | 14+ |
| Light Infantry | 14+ |
| Other Infantry | 18+ |

**Pursuit Throws:** For each eligible pursuing unit, the victorious army’s commander makes a pursuit throw against the appropriate value from the table below. Add +4 to the pursuit throw if all of the defeated army’s cavalry or flyer units were destroyed or routed. Each successful throw eliminates one enemy unit. If the defeated army ended the battle without any cavalry or flyer units, the victorious army commander may choose which unit(s) are eliminated. Otherwise the defeated army’s general may choose which unit(s) are eliminated.

EXAMPLE: Army B routed off the battlefield. Army A is pursuing with four light cavalry units. A’s commander makes four pursuit throws against 11+, with a +4 bonus for all of Army B’s cavalry being destroyed or routed. He rolls a modified 6, 9, 12 and a 16, so two units of Army B are eliminated. Since all of Army B’s cavalry units were destroyed or routed, Army A’s general chooses which units are eliminated. He elects to destroy both of B’s light cavalry (which had routed from the battle).

**Pursuit against Evading Armies:** As explained in **Types of Battles** earlier in this chapter, certain battles (rear guard actions, rear guard envelopments, and skirmishes) involve offensive armies fighting evading armies. The longer it takes to defeat an evading army, the harder it is for the offensive army to pursue. Each battle turn imposes a cumulative -1 penalty to subsequent pursuit throws against a defeated evading army. A natural roll of 20 always eliminates a unit, regardless of any modifiers.

EXAMPLE: Army A confronts Army B in a rear guard action. After six battle turns, Army B’s rear guard units have all been defeated. Army A is now eligible to pursue Army B but all its pursuing units suffer a -6 penalty to their pursuit throws.

### Casualties

After pursuit, each army’s leader will determine his army’s casualties, using the following rules.

**Destroyed Units:** For each unit that was destroyed, 50% of its troops (rounded up) are crippled or dead, while the other 50% (rounded down) are lightly wounded. The victorious army’s wounded troops return to their unit in one week. The defeated army’s wounded troops become prisoners.

EXAMPLE: An army containing a unit of 120 orcs was destroyed. 60 of the orcs are crippled or dead, while 60 are lightly wounded. If the orc’s army won the battle, it will recover its wounded; it will be able to field a unit of 60 orcs in one week. If the orc’s army lost the battle, the wounded orcs become prisoners of the victorious army.

**Routed Units:** For each unit that was routed, 25% of its troops (rounded up) are crippled or dead, while another 25% (rounded up) are lightly wounded. 50% of the victorious army’s routed, wounded troops are lost to desertion (round up); the rest return to the unit in one week. 50% of a defeated army’s routed, wounded troops become prisoners of the victorious army (round up); the other wounded troops are lost to desertion.

EXAMPLE: A unit of 120 orcs routed. 30 troops are crippled or dead, while another 30 are lightly wounded. If the orc’s army won the battle, 15 of the wounded troops are lost to desertion, reducing the unit to 75 orcs. If the orc’s army lost the battle, 15 of the wounded troops become prisoners of the victorious army and the other 15 are lost to desertion. The unit is reduced to 60 orcs.

Half-strength units may be consolidated to form a smaller number of full-strength units, if desired.

**Officer Casualties:** If an officer’s unit is destroyed, the officer(s) must roll on the Mortal Wounds table. Apply the officer’s modifiers from Constitution, Equipment, and Hit Dice value. Do not apply any modifier for Hit Points unless the officer was incapacitated in a heroic foray. For officers of the victorious army, apply a +3 proficiency modifier and a -3 treatment time modifier (for a net modifier of 0). For officers of the defeated army, apply a +1 proficiency modifier and -5 treatment modifier (for a net modifier of -4). The effects of the roll are as follows:

* *Instantly Killed:* The officer died on the battlefield. His body is in the hands of the victorious army.
* *Mortally Wounded:* The officer died while receiving treatment. His body in the hands of the victorious army.
* *Grievously Wounded:* If part of the defeated army, the officer died while receiving treatment. His body is in the hands of the victorious army. If part of the victorious army, the officer was saved by the healers. Roll 1d6 for permanent wound.
* *Critically Wounded or Shocked:* The officer was saved by the healers. Roll 1d6 for permanent wound. If part of the defeated army, the officer was captured.
* *Knocked Out or Just Dazed:* The officer wasn’t that badly hurt. Roll 1d6 for permanent wound. If part of the defeated army, the officer was able to escape before being captured.

If an officer’s unit is routed, the officer has two options. He can roll on the Mortal Wounds table as if his unit were destroyed, or he can allow himself to be captured by the opposing army without risking the roll.

**Heroic Casualties:** If a hero functioning as a unit with BR on the battlefield is destroyed or routed, apply the rules for officer casualties to the hero. If a hero on a heroic foray is incapacitated, he can be treated during the foray or in the lull immediately after; if not so treated, apply the rules for officer casualties to the hero.

### Spoils of War

Historically, most soldiers fought for the **spoils of war**. Those spoils could come in the form of booty from a pillaged city, food, wine and women from plundered cities, land captured in combat, or ransoms from captured nobility, but it was ultimately the prospect of economic gains that motivated ancient and medieval fighters. It was the nobility and leadership that were most motivated by the prospect of glory and renown from winning battles. To reflect this, ***ACKS***rewards leaders and heroes for the army’s valor at arms, while the common soldiers are rewarded only for their personal material gain.

The spoils of war from a victorious battle are equal to one month’s wages of each destroyed or routed unit (consisting of salvaged equipment, valuables, wages on hand, etc.). In addition, each prisoner captured is worth 40gp if sold as a slave or ransomed. (Higher level NPCs, monsters, and similar creatures can be ransomed for greater sums, at the Judge’s discretion.) If kept, prisoners can be used as **construction workers** (p. XX).

EXAMPLE: In a great battle, an army has destroyed or routed 7 units of 60 heavy cavalry (60gp/month per troop) and 10 units of 120 heavy infantry (12gp/month per troop). From the defeated units, the victorious army captured and ransomed 550 prisoners. The spoils for defeating the heavy cavalry are (7 x 60 x 60) 25,200gp. The spoils for defeating the heavy infantry are (10 x 120 x 12) 14,400gp. The spoils from ransoming the prisoners are (550 x 40) 22,000gp. The total spoils are 61,600gp.

Remember that casualties and prisoners can be consumed as supplies by **carnivorous units** (p. XX).

###### Experience Points from Spoils

Each participant (whether a commander, a hero, or a creature in a unit) earns 1 XP for each gold piece he collects from the spoils of war. The troops will expect that at least 50% of any spoils captured will be shared equally among all units. If this does not occur, the Judge should make a loyalty roll for any unpaid troops. The leader can distribute 50% of the spoils captured to himself and/or his commanders as he sees fit, although it is traditional to do so in proportion to their units commanded. If a commander who performed well in the battle is given an unreasonably small share of the spoils (Judge’s discretion), it counts as a calamity.

EXAMPLE: An army consisting of 8 units of 120 heavy infantry and 8 units of 60 heavy cavalry, led by a 9th level fighter, has gathered battle loot worth 16,000gp. The leader claims half (8,000gp) for himself and shares the remaining 8,000gp among the 16 units. Each of the 16 units gets 500gp each. The leader earns 8,000XP, each heavy infantryman receives (500/120) = 4 XP and each heavy cavalryman receives (500 / 60) = 8 XP.

For ease of play, troops’ XP can be tracked on a unit-by-unit basis. 0th level characters can be advanced to 1st level as per the rules in under **0th Level Characters and Experience from Adventuring** (p. XXX). It requires 500 XP for a 0th level mercenary to become a 1st level fighter. It requires 500 XP for a 0th level untrained militia to become a 0th level mercenary.

###### Experience Points from Combat

The army’s commanders earn XP equal to the value of enemy units defeated, less the value of friendly units defeated. 50% of the XP goes to the army’s leader, while the remaining XP is divided proportionately among the commanders based on the number of units each commander had in his division, excluding the army leader’s division. (This is why ambitious commanders always demand to lead more troops!)

EXAMPLE: An army of 10 human heavy infantry companies (5XP per man equals 600XP per unit) defeats 12 orc light infantry companies (10 XP per orc equals 1,200 XP per unit) while losing 3 units itself. The overall leader and three commanders of the army will split [(12 x 1,200) – (3 x 600)] 12,600 XP. The leader, with a division of four companies, receives 6,300 XP. The first commander had three companies, the second had two companies,, and the third had one company, so the commanders receive 3150 XP, 2100 XP, and 1050 XP respectively.

Characters also earn XP for the creatures they personally defeated. Troops (i.e. non-heroes) on the winning side receive 75 x (enemy army BR / friendly army BR) XP from combat each. Troops on the losing side gets no XP from combat.

# Chapter 12: Sieges

A **siege** is an attempt to capture a garrisoned **stronghold** or **urban settlement**. The army laying siege is known as the **besieging army** or besieger, while the army garrisoning the stronghold is the **defending army** or defender. Hereafter, any reference to “strongholds” is inclusive of urban settlements unless otherwise noted.

## Methods of Siege

|  |
| --- |
| **Sieges Without Maps:** If you do not have a map for a besieged stronghold, you can estimate a stone stronghold’s shp by dividing the stronghold or urban settlement’s gp value by 10 and rounding up. This is not an exact calculus, but it will serve for most castles and fortified towns.  EXAMPLE: When the Judge prepared his campaign setting, he decided Moruvai’s stronghold was worth 185,000gp, but he never mapped it out. Based on the stronghold value, he estimates that Moruvai’s stronghold has about (185,000 / 10) 18,500 shp.  Structural hit points can be used to estimate the number of troops that can garrison a stronghold. For every 1,000 shp, a stronghold can be defended by 1 unit (rounded up).  EXAMPLE: With 24,000 shp, Moruvai’s stronghold can be defended by (24,000 / 1,000) 24 units.  Wooden strongholds have 1/10th the shp of a stone stronghold, but comparable unit capacity. |

There are three basic methods of capturing strongholds. In a **blockade**, the besieging army encircles the besieged stronghold with its forces to deny re-supply and escape. In a **reduction**, the besieging army deploys bombardment and siege-mines to destroy the stronghold. In an **assault**, the besieging army attacks the stronghold directly to capture it with force of arms.

A besieger may employ one, some, or all of these methods. Most commonly, the besieging army will begin with blockade and then move on to reduction. Only if a stronghold has still refused to capitulate will the besieging army resort to assault. Most sieges end before progressing to an assault, but they are generally conducted as ifthey will end with an assault, if only to intimidate the defender into surrendering.

The sequence of siege tactics can vary considerably, however, with methods overlapping or repeating as necessary. A besieger might immediately attempt an assault, hoping for a quick victory, and only then begin blockade and reduction when the initial assault fails. It might then resume bombardment, only to assault again upon learning that a relief force is on its way.

## Siege Mechanics

***ACKS II***uses the **structural hit points (shp)** and **unit capacity** of strongholds to resolve the outcome of sieges. See Chapter 4, **Structures** (p. XX) for a list of shp and unit capacity by structure type.

Calculating a stronghold’s structural hit points simply requires adding up the shp of the walls and buildings that make up of the structure. Calculating a stronghold’s unit capacity likewise requires adding up the number of units that the stronghold can contain.

EXAMPLE: Moruvai’s stronghold falls under siege by Marcus. Moruvai’s stronghold consists of a keep (15,000 shp, unit capacity 12); 4 medium towers (1,000 shp, unit capacity 1 each); and 4 100’ lengths of wall (1,500 shp and unit capacity 2 each). The stronghold has 25,000 shp and unit capacity 24.

Unit capacity and structural hit points interact to determine how many units can assault and defend a stronghold. For every point of unit capacity, a stronghold can be assaulted and defended by 1 unit. For each 1,000 shp of damage dealt, a **breach** is created that permits another unit to join the assault.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Effect of Unit Capacity and Structural Hit Points** | |
| Unit Capacity | For each point, a stronghold can be assaulted and defended by 1 unit |
| Structural Hit Points | For each breach (1,000 shp of damage) 1 additional unit can assault the stronghold |

Thus, any attempt to assault an undamaged stronghold will put assaulting units up against defending units at a 1:1 ratio. Since a unit defending a stronghold has significant advantages over a unit assaulting a stronghold, a fully-garrisoned and undamaged stronghold is very, very hard to capture. In order to overcome the defending army’s initial advantage, the besieging army must reduce the stronghold’s defenses. The gradual creation of breaches to allow for a successful assault is the core of siege warfare in ***ACKS****.*

EXAMPLE: As the siege begins, Moruvai’s keep has a unit capacity of 24. If Marcus were to assault immediately, he could assault with 24 units and Moruvai could defend with 24 units. Instead, Marcus patiently bombards Moruvai’s stronghold for several weeks, dealing 15,000 shp of damage. That’s 15 breaches! Now Marcus can assault with (24 + 15) 39 units, while Moruvai can still only defend with 24 units.

## Blockade

|  |
| --- |
| **Blockade Quick Reference** |
| 1 point of unit capacity requires… |
| 2 blockading units, or |
| 1/2 blockading ship, or |
| 250’ of circumvallation |
| Minimum 20 units / 10 ships / 5000’ |

In a **blockade**, the besieging army encircles the besieged stronghold to deny the defenders the opportunity to re-supply or escape. To blockade a besieged stronghold, the besieging army must encircle the area around the besieged stronghold with troops, ships, or fortifications. Once a blockade is in place, the besieged stronghold is cut off from its supply lines.

If a besieging army has the luxury of time and resources, a blockade may be all that’s required to win the siege. Within a few months, the defending garrison will run out of supplies and be forced to surrender or starve. Most besiegers have supply concerns of their own, however, and cannot afford to wait a season or more for a recalcitrant city or fortress to surrender.

### Blockading with Units

The number of units required to blockade a stronghold is equal to twice the unit capacity of the stronghold, with a minimum of 20 units required. The units can be infantry units of 120 troops or cavalry units of 60 troops. (Even though cavalry units only consist of 60 troops, they are able to patrol as well as 120 infantry troops because of their greater mobility and scouting ability.) Units cannot be assigned to construction projects if they are being used to blockade.

EXAMPLE: Marcus wishes to blockade Moruvai’s stronghold with his troops. Moruvai’s stronghold has a unit capacity of 24, so it will require 48 units to blockade the stronghold. Marcus’s army has 50 units (6,000 troops). He assigns 48 units to blockade the stronghold. He has only 2 units remaining for construction projects or other purposes.

### Blockading with Ships

Strongholds built on navigable waterways will be able to re-supply along the waterway if it is not blocked. The besieging army must have a sufficient number of ships to blockade the waterway. To function in a naval blockade, a ship must have a ram, an artillery piece, or at least 20 marines on board.

Blockading a stronghold surrounded by waterways on all sides (such as an island) requires one ship for each 2 points of unit capacity. If the stronghold faces water for only a portion of its perimeter, multiply the stronghold’s unit capacity by the percentage of the stronghold’s perimeter which faces the waterway.

The besieging army does nothave to blockade the portion of the walls blockaded by ship. It must still blockade any remaining walls facing land.

EXAMPLE: Baal the Terrible has laid siege to Aura. Aura is an enormous city with a unit capacity of 300. Aura is a harbor city on a peninsula, and 70% of Aura’s walls touch the sea. Therefore (300 x 0.70 / 2) 105 ships are required to blockade Aura’s sea walls. 90 units (300 x 0.30) are still necessary to blockade the land walls of Aura.

If the besieged stronghold is protected by a navy of its own, the number of ships required to blockade the stronghold is increased by the size of the stronghold’s navy.

EXAMPLE: If a fleet of 25 ships protects Aura, Baal the Terrible will need (105 + 25) 130 ships to blockade Aura.

### Blockading with Fortifications (Circumvallation)

Given sufficient time, the besieging army may encircle the besieged stronghold with a line of fortifications built outside of bow-shot of the stronghold’s walls, known as a **circumvallation**. A circumvallation consists of a mix of wooden palisades (8’ high x 1” thick), trenches (10’ wide x 5’ deep), and earthen ramparts (8’ high x 1’ thick). Circumvallations cost 100gp per 100’ length.

Construction of a circumvallation is usually divided into several **construction projects** at **construction sites** around the besieged stronghold. As a guideline, each project should encompass at least 2,500’ (about half a mile) of circumvallation. The workers on the circumvallation projects are usually unskilled labor drawn from the besieging army, but craftsmen may be used if available. Construction of circumvallations can also be assisted with *earth’s movement*. See Chapter 4, **Construction Projects** (p. XX – XX).

Each 250’ length of circumvallation reduces the number of units required to maintain the blockade by 2 (e.g. 250’ is required per point of unit capacity). If the circumvallation reduces the number of units required for the blockade to 0, it completely encircles the stronghold. A complete circumvallation imposes a -4 penalty on attempts to smuggle supplies into the stronghold.

Circumvallations cannot blockade access to waterways. Ships must be used to blockade navigable waterways.

EXAMPLE: Marcus’s army has laid siege to Moruvai’s stronghold (unit capacity 24). He wants to erect a circumvallation that will entirely encircle the stronghold. Therefore the circumvallation must be (24 x 250’) 6,000’ around. The circumvallation’s construction cost will be 6,250gp.

Marcus has 6,000 troops. Marcus splits the circumvallation into 2 construction projects, each consisting of 3,000’ of circumvallation. 3,000 troops are assigned to work on each project. Each project has a construction rate of (3,000 x 0.1gp/day) 300gp per day, so it will take (3,000 / 300) 10 days to complete each circumvallation. When the circumvallations are complete, the stronghold will be blockaded, and the troops can be used for other purposes.

### Effects of a Blockade

As soon as a blockade is in place, the defending army loses access to its supply line. It is thereafter restricted to paying its supply cost from the actual value of supplies already in the besieged stronghold, or from supplies smuggled into the stronghold. A blockaded stronghold is very vulnerable to having its supplies destroyed by sabotage.

**Stored Supplies:** Strongholds usually have a larder and pantry provisioned for siege. By default, the value of supplies stored in a besieged stronghold will be 600gp per point of unit capacity, enough for 10 weeks if garrisoned at full capacity. Gold and other liquid wealth held by the ruler does notcount towards the value of supplies!

EXAMPLE: Moruvai is blockaded in his stronghold by Marcus’s army. Moruvai has 10 infantry units in his castle. His army requires (10 x 60) 600gp in supplies each week. Moruvai’s stronghold has a unit capacity of 24 units, so the stronghold has (24 x 600gp) 14,400gp in supplies stored up. The castle therefore has sufficient supplies to maintain the defending army for (14,400gp / 600) 24 weeks.

If the stronghold is not blockaded immediately, the defending army will be able to gather far more supplies. Increase the value of supplies stored in the stronghold by 600gp per point of unit capacity for each week of preparation time available to the defending army. A stronghold cannot hold more than 3,000gp of supplies per point of unit capacity (1 year’s supplies).

EXAMPLE: If it took Marcus two weeks to blockade Moruvai’s stronghold, then Moruvai would have time to gather an additional (24 x 600gp/week x 2 weeks) 28,800gp worth of supplies.

**Loss of Supplies:** If and when supplies become exhausted, the defending troops suffer all of the normal consequences from loss of supply. Each week troops are partially or completely unsupplied also counts as a calamity, and triggers a loyalty roll. Few sieges last long once the defender’s supplies are exhausted! See Chapter 10, **Supplying Armies** (p. XX), for additional information on supply.

### Hijinks During Blockade

Either or both armies may resort tohijinks during the course of a blockade. See Chapter 10, **Spying and Other Hijinks** (p. XX) for additional information on hijinks.

**Smuggling:** A defending army leader with access to perpetrators can order his perpetrators to attempt smuggling hijinks to re-supply his stronghold. For smuggling to succeed, the perpetrator must make a successful Move Silently throw. The proficiency throw is penalized by the besieging leader’s strategic ability. If a circumvallation completely encircles the stronghold, the proficiency throw suffers an additional -4 penalty. If the throw is successful, the perpetrator smuggles 1,000gp of supplies in per class level (representing a mix of grains, beer, preserved meat, salt, onions, etc.). The perpetrator can smuggle extra supplies by taking a -1 penalty on the proficiency throw per 1,000gp.

**Sabotage**: A besieging army leader with access to perpetrators inside the besieged stronghold (infiltrated perpetrators) can order his perpetrators to attempt sabotagehijinks against the defending army’s supplies. For sabotage to succeed, the perpetrator must make a successful Move Silently throw. The proficiency throw is modified by the opposing army’s leader’s strategic ability (as skilled generals tend to be better at guarding their stored supplies). If the throw is successful, the perpetrator destroys 1,000gp of supplies per class level. The perpetrator can destroy extra supplies by taking a -1 penalty on the proficiency throw per 1,000gp.

## Reduction

In a **reduction**, the besieging armyseeks to weaken the defending stronghold with artillery bombardment, siege-mining, or magic. Reduction tactics deal damage to the besieged stronghold’s structural hit points. If the stronghold’s shp are reduced to 0, the stronghold is reduced to flattened rubble. Most sieges never get so far, as even partial destruction of a stronghold will substantially hamper its defense: Each 1,000 shp of damage dealt creates a breach that an assaulting unit can exploit.

### Reduction by Bombardment

Bombardment by an artillery piece (ballista, catapult, trebuchet, etc.) reduces the stronghold’s shp each day by the amount shown on the Artillery Bombardment table, below. Separate damage values are listed for wooden and stone strongholds, as wooden strongholds are considerably more vulnerable to artillery.

| **Artillery**  **Type** | **Daily Damage**  **v. Wood** | **Daily Damage**  **v. Stone** | **Shots Fired**  **Per Day** | **Daily Ammo**  **Cost** | **Maximum**  **Range** |
| Medium Ballista | 200 | - | 240 | 7gp | 600’ |
| Heavy Ballista | 725 | 25 | 240 | 35gp | 900’ |
| Light Catapult | 725 | 25 | 240 | 35gp | 900’ |
| Medium Catapult | 825 | 30 | 240 | 200gp | 1200’ |
| Heavy Catapult | 1,425 | 50 | 240 | 735gp | 1200’ |
| Light Trebuchet | 1,300 | 45 | 240 | 715gp | 1500’ |
| Medium Trebuchet | 1,600 | 55 | 240 | 900gp | 1500’ |
| Heavy Trebuchet | 2,250 | 250 | 240 | 1,900gp | 1500’ |

EXAMPLE: Marcus is bombarding Moruvai’s stronghold with 2 light trebuchets and 4 light catapults. Each light trebuchet deals 45 shp of damage per day. Each light catapult deals 25 shp of damage per day. The stronghold is dealt [(45 x 2) + (25 x 4)] 190 shp of damage, leaving it with (25,000 – 190) 24,810 shp. On the sixth day of bombardment, Marcus will create a breach.

**Ammunition:** Sieges consume an enormous amount of artillery ammunition. A fully-crewed artillery piece bombarding around the clock will expend 240 shots per day! The shots fired each day of a bombardment are listed on the Artillery Bombardment table.

To maintain this volume of fire, artillery crews will use re-purposed enemy ammo, rocks pulled from nearby buildings, rubble knocked loose by the bombardment, slaughtered animals, or even cadavers. For game purposes, ***ACKS*** considers catapults and trebuchets in siege conditions to be firing the cheapest available ammunition, i.e. crude light catapult shot, costing 15cp each. (Remember that catapults and trebuchets can fire ammunition of a lighter or heavier weight than indicated for their type, though accuracy is reduced.)

The daily cost of ammunition is listed on the Artillery Bombardment table. The cost of ammunition during a siege is added to the army’s supply cost. For the besieging army, the daily cost represents consumption of ammunition being brought in by its supply train. For the defending army (which is usually out of supply), the daily cost represents consumption of ammunition stored before the siege.

Workers can be assigned to scavenge for ammunition if desired. Scavenging ammunition is a construction project. The construction cost for scavenged ammunition is 1/10th the daily cost listed on the Artillery Bombardment table. As long as workers are available for the construction project, the artillery can be kept firing for “free.” See Chapter 4, **Construction Projects** (p. XX).

EXAMPLE: 2 master stonemasons, 4 journeymen, 8 apprentices, and 80 unskilled laborers are assigned to scavenge ammunition. Their total construction rate is (5gp x 2) + (80 x 1sp) 18gp per day, which is the equivalent to 180gp worth of ammunition. The workers can supply, e.g., 5 light catapults.

An artillery piece with only limited access to ammunition may still bombard, but its damage is reduced by an amount proportional to the amount of ammunition available.

**Artillery Duels:** It is considerably more difficult to conduct bombardment when the besieged stronghold can return fire. When both the besieging and defending armies have artillery, the besieger has two options. A cautious besieger can restrict himself to using artillery capable of bombarding from outside the range of the defender’s artillery. If the besieging army has no artillery that outrange the defender’s artillery, of course, then this is not an option.

EXAMPLE: Moruvai has 4 medium catapults defending his stronghold. These medium catapults outrange Marcus’s light catapults (400’ to 300’). If Marcus does not wish to put his light catapults at risk, he must bombard using only his light trebuchets. If Marcus only had light catapults, this would not be an option.

A more aggressive besieger can offer an **artillery duel** by moving his artillery into range of one or more of the defender’s artillery pieces. Only artillery within range can participate in the artillery duel. The besieging army can choose the ranges at which an artillery duel is offered. The defending army can accept the offer, or move his artillery out of range and into cover and allow the besieger to bombard freely. (A defending army can also offer an artillery duel, though this is less common.) Either or both sides might deploy spellcasters to affect the outcome. An artillery duel should be resolved as a heroic foray with an encounter distance each to the range of the artillery involved.

### Reduction by Magic

Certain spells can be used to directly damage or destroy strongholds. These spells, and the damage they deal to structures, are shown on the accompanying table. The mechanisms by which these spells deal damage is obvious in most cases. While *sunder structure* only deals 250 shp in tactical combat, in a reduction we assume it is being placed such that it topples a high wall or tower, creating a 1,000 shp breach.

Other spells are designed to damage creatures but can also affect structures. In general, spells divide hp damage dealt to wooden structures by 10 and to stone structures by 50. This can result in no damage being dealt. However, spells that have an area of effect deal more damage, because they affect more of the structure. Increase the damage dealt by a factor equal to the square feet of structure affected / 25 square feet. For instance, if a 15’ x 15 wooden building is engulfed in a fireball, damage is decreased by a factor of 10 but increased by a factor of (225 / 25) = 9, for a total of x0.9 shp to the building. The approximate damage dealt by spells against structures in ordinary circumstances has been listed on the table below to avoid having to calculate it in play. (Obviously if a 60’ diameter *conflagration* is targeted against a 10’ square structure, the structure doesn’t take 450 shp, but it’s obliterated either way.)

*Earth’s movement*and *earth’s mire*present special cases, as the spells cannotdirectly affect worked stone. *Earth’s mire*can be used to transform the earth beneath strongholds into mud, weakening foundations. 50% of the damage is recovered when the spell expires or is *dispelled*. *Earth’s movement*can shift the ground beneath strongholds, causing structural damage much as an earthquake would. *Earth’s movement* cannot be used if the stronghold is built on solid rock (such as a mountain-top fortress), unless *earth’s mire*is used first. Note that wooden structures take relatively less damage from earth movement, just as in real life.

| *Thunderbolt* (1d6/level in 120’ line) | electrical hp damage x 1/5 | electrical hp damage x 1 |

### Reduction by Monsters

Sometimes the besieging army might deploy monsters to reduce a structure. Huge creatures deal 1/3 damage to wooden structures and 1/10 damage to stone structures. Gigantic creatures deal full damage to wooden structures and 1/3 damage to stone structures. Colossal creatures deal full damage to both wood and stone structures.

### Reduction by Siege-Mining

|  |
| --- |
| **How Big is a Siege-mine?** Each siege-mine consists of approximately 20,000 cubic feet of tunnel, running from the lines of circumvallation to the besieged stronghold. A construction rate of 1gp per day excavates 20 cubic feet of underground tunnel daily (20,000 cubic feet x 1gp / 20 cubic feet = 1,000gp).  If the Judge has a map of the besieged stronghold and lines of circumvallation around it, the Judge may map out the precise tunnels dug during excavation, but for game purposes this is not necessary. |

The besieging army may dig one or more **siege mines** to reduce the besieged stronghold. Siege mining involves excavating wooden-reinforced earthen tunnels under and around the besieged stronghold. Once the stronghold’s foundations are sufficiently undermined with tunnels, the tunnels are filled with combustible material, and set aflame. The subsequent fire then burns away the mine’s wooden support structures, collapsing the tunnel and the structure above it.

Excavating a siege-mine is a construction project with a cost of 1,000gp. Construction of a siege-mine must be supervised by an engineer. No more than 100 workers can be assigned to each siege-mine. Because of these limits, craftsmen rather than unskilled laborers generally do the bulk of mining. When the siege-mine is completed, the tunnels are set aflame, and the besieged stronghold suffers 6d6 x 100 shp of damage.

If a petard is used in a siege-mine, increase the damage dealt by 100 x the petard’s damage. For instance, placing a 40 lb petard (4d6 damage) in a siege-mine would increase the siege mine’s damage by 4d6 x 100 shp of damage.

A besieging army may pursue as many siege-mine projects as desired, subject to the number of available engineers and workers. However, siege-mining is dirty and dangerous work, and any workers assigned to a siege-mining project must make loyalty rolls each week. Any loyalty roll of an unmodified “2” means a mining accident destroys the mine and kills all the assigned workers! (The supervising engineer may make a saving throw versus Blast to escape death.) The value of the mine is lost when an accident occurs.

EXAMPLE: Marcus assigns 100 skilled workers, with a construction rate of 70gp per day, to begin siege-mining Moruvai’s stronghold. At the end of each week, the miners must make a loyalty roll. On a natural “2”, the workers die in a mining accident. The miners’ luck holds, however, and after 15 days (2 loyalty rolls), the mine is completed. The supervising engineer sets the mine aflame, and the resulting collapse deals 6d6 x 100 shp of damage to the stronghold overhead. The roll yields a 21 — 2,100 shp of damage, two breaches! Marcus watches in glee as Moruvai’s curtain walls go “BOOM!”

**Countermining:** During the course of a mining project, the defender might detect the siege-mine by, e.g. interrogation of captured prisoners, raids into the enemy camp, etc. Once the mine is detected, he may order construction of one or more countermines. Countermining is a construction project, supervised by an engineer. Up to 100 workers can be assigned to each counter-mine. Like siege-mining, countermining requires a weekly loyalty roll, with an unmodified “2” resulting in a mining accident. Countermines are used to sortie into the besieger’s tunnels and disrupt the digging. In game terms, this is represented by applying the construction rate of each countermining project as a penalty tothe construction rate of one siege-mining project.

EXAMPLE: Moruvai tasks 100 workers with a total construction rate of 70gp per day to begin countermining. This reduces Marcus’s siege-miners to a construction rate of (70gp - 70gp) 0gp per day. Marcus responds by launching a second siege-mining project, assigning this siege-mine another engineer and another 100 workers.

**Impregnable Strongholds:** Some strongholds cannot be reduced by siege-mining.If a stronghold is built on solid rock (such as a mountain-top fortress), its foundation is too hard to easily excavate, and is unlikely to readily collapse. If a stronghold is entirely surrounded by water (either navigable waterways or a moat of at least 10’ depth), the fluid will flood the mining tunnels and make the tunnel-and-burn process virtually impossible.

### Reduction by Hijinks

**Arson:** An infiltrated perpetrator can attempt to reduce the stronghold by arson. For arson to succeed, the perpetrator must make a successful Sneaking throw. The proficiency throw is modified by the opposing army’s leader’s strategic ability. If the throw is successful, the perpetrator destroys 4d6 x 10 shp per class level. The perpetrator can set a larger fire by taking a -1 penalty on the proficiency throw per 4d6 x 10 additional shp. Divide damage from arson by 10 if the besieged stronghold is stone.

**Subversion:** An infiltrated perpetrator can attempt to subvert the stronghold’s defenses. For subversion to succeed, the perpetrator must make a successful Hiding throw. The proficiency throw is modified by the opposing army leader’s strategic ability. If the throw is successful, the perpetrator creates a breach in the stronghold. The perpetrator can create additional breaches by taking a -1 penalty on the proficiency throw per breach. Breaches created with subversion must be exploited with an assault immediately or they are lost, as they are nothing more than unlocked doors, opened gates, etc.

### Stronghold Repair

After each day of reduction, the defending army may make repairs during the evening hours. Making repairs is a construction project. Wooden construction is repaired at a rate of 5 shp of damage per 1gp of construction rate. Stone construction, while sturdier, is harder to fix. It is repaired at a rate of 1 shp of damage per 1gp of construction rate. Only half of all damage sustained during the siege can be repaired. The remainder must be re-built when the siege is lifted, at full construction cost.

EXAMPLE: Moruvai’s stone stronghold has taken damage from Marcus’s bombardment. 1,000 unskilled laborers are assigned to repair the fortifications overnight. Their construction rate is (1,000 x 0.1gp) 100gp per day, so they can repair 100 shp of damage.

## Assault

If, after having been blockaded and reduced, a stronghold has still refused to capitulate, the besieging army may resort to **assault**. An assaultseeks to capture the stronghold through force of arms. Assaults are decisive, but expensive in manpower and material. Even successful assaults against battered strongholds will come at a high price in blood. Assaults are resolved in a series of **assault turns** following the procedure below. The system should be familiar, as it is similar to that described in Chapter 11, **Running a Battle**.

### Gathering the Units

Make a counter or marker for each unit in each participating division in each army. Group the units into their divisions and be sure to mark which unit the general and the division commander is with, as well as any lieutenants or other heroes (p. XX). Note down which units are **missile units**, **loose units**, **cavalry units**, **artillery units**, and **war machine units**.

### Setting up the Assault

On a battlemat or large sheet of paper, divide the battlefield into Stronghold, Stronghold Interior, Assault, and Reserve zones, as shown.

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Reserve | | | | | | |
|  |  | Assault | | |  |  |
|  |  | Stronghold Walls | | |  |  |
|  |  |  | Stronghold Interior |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

### Deploying the Armies

Each side now deploys its army, starting with the besieging army.

The besieging army’s leader selects one or more units from his army to serve as **assaulting units**. A maximum of 1 unit per point of unit capacity plus 1 additional unit per breach in the stronghold can be assigned to the assault. The leader must designate which units are assaulting through breaches. Units that attack in the Artillery and Missile phase cannot be assigned to assault through breaches. Other units are assumed to be assaulting with siege ladders. The leader does not have to assault with the maximum number of units if he doesn’t want to. The besieging army leader should also decide what artillery and siege equipment, if any, is being used in the assault. Artillery and siege equipment do not count against the maximum number of units. All assaulting units are placed in the assault zone. All other units are placed in the reserve zone.

The defending army’s leader selects one or more units from his army to serve as **defending units**. A maximum of 1 unit per point of unit capacity may be assigned to the defense. Breaches do not increase the number of defending units allowed. The leader does not have to defend with the maximum number of units if he doesn’t want to. The defending army leader should also decide what artillery and siege equipment, if any, is being used in the defense. Artillery and siege equipment do not count against maximum number of units. All defending units are assigned to the stronghold walls zone. All units other units are in the stronghold interior zone.

### Resolving the Assaults

Assaults are resolved in a series of **assault turns** following the procedure below. Each assault turn represents approximately 10 minutes of hard fighting. Note that while artillery in a battle fire during the missile phase, artillery in assaults have a separate phase.

1. **Artillery Phase.** In this phase, artillery units in the assault and stronghold zones exchange fire.
   1. Calculate Battle Ratings. Each army leader sums the battle rating of all artillery units in the appropriate zone.
   2. Make Heroic Forays.Heroic PCs and NPCs in the zone can now make **heroic forays** at artillery range to influence the battle rating in favor of one army or the other. All heroes’ heroic forays are revealed and resolved simultaneously. Lost units are then removed.
   3. Determine Hits.Each army leader simultaneously rolls a number of attack throws equal to the battle rating of the artillery units that remain in the zone. The target value for the attack throws is 18+, modified by the Attack Throw Modifiers listed below. For each successful attack throw, one hit is scored. If at the start of step c, one side has no units in its zone, see **Breaking a Zone** (p. XX).
   4. Apply Casualties.Each army leader tallies the hits scored against his army. The besieging army leader then removes units from the assault zone with a combined battle rating equal to or greater than the total hits scored against his army. The defending army leader removes units from the stronghold walls zone in like manner. The units removed do not need to be artillery units. These units are destroyed (or, if loose units, **withdrawn**; see below). If all of an army’s units in a zone are defeated, the remaining hits are lost. Hits are applied simultaneously.
2. **Missile Phase.** In this phase, missile units in the assault and stronghold zones exchange fire.
   1. Calculate Battle Ratings.Each army leader sums the battle rating of all missile units in the appropriate zone.
   2. Make Heroic Forays.Heroic PCs and NPCs in the zone can now make **heroic forays** at missile range to influence the battle rating in favor of one army or the other. All heroes’ heroic forays are revealed and resolved simultaneously. Lost units are then removed.
   3. Determine Hits.Each army leader simultaneously rolls a number of attack throws equal to the battle rating of the missile units that remain in the zone. The target value for the attack throws is 17+, modified by the Attack Throw Modifiers listed below. For each successful attack throw, one hit is scored. If at the start of step c, one side has no units in its zone, see **Breaking a Zone** (p. XX).
   4. Apply Casualties.Each army leader tallies the hits scored against his army. The besieging army leader then removes units from the assault zone with a combined battle rating equal to or greater than the total hits scored against his army. The defending army leader removes units from the stronghold walls zone in like manner. The units removed do not need to be missile units. These units are destroyed (or, if loose units, **withdrawn**; see below). If all of an army’s units in a zone are defeated, the remaining hits are lost. Hits are applied simultaneously.
3. **Melee Phase.** In this phase, melee units in the assault and stronghold zones exchange fire.
   1. Calculate Battle Ratings.Each army leader sums the battle rating of all remaining units in the appropriate zone. War machines that have battle ratings are included in this total. War machines that have special effects (such as offering an additional attack throw) take effect in step c.
   2. Make Heroic Forays.Heroic PCs and NPCs in the zone can now make **heroic forays** at missile range to influence the battle rating in favor of one army or the other. All heroes’ heroic forays are revealed and resolved simultaneously. Lost units are then removed.
   3. Determine Hits.Each army leader simultaneously rolls a number of attack throws equal to the battle rating of the units that remain in the zone. The target value for the attack throws is 16+, modified by the Attack Throw Modifiers listed below. For each successful attack throw, one hit is scored. If at the start of step c, one side has no units in its zone, see **Breaking a Zone** (p. XX).
   4. Apply Casualties.Each army leader tallies the hits scored against his army. The besieging army leader then removes units from the assault zone with a combined battle rating equal to or greater than the total hits scored against his army. The defending army leader removes units from the stronghold walls zone in like manner. The units removed do not need to be melee units or war machines. These units are destroyed. Loose units cannot withdraw during the assault phase. If all of an army’s units in a zone are defeated, the remaining hits are lost. Hits are applied simultaneously.
4. **Morale Phase.** The Judge now checks to see whether either army has reached a **break point** and if so resolves **morale rolls**, as explained in **Ending Battles** (p. XX).
5. **Victory Check Phase.** If all of the defending units are defeated, and the defending army has no units in the interior zone, the stronghold is captured. If all of the assaulting units are defeated, and the besieging army has no units in the reserve zone, then the stronghold is liberated. Either way, see **Ending Sieges** (p. XX).
6. **Redeployment Phase.** Either army can now **redeploy** units. The army leader with the lower strategic ability must redeploy first. The army leader can redeploy a number of units equal to this Leadership Ability. A besieging unit can be moved from the assault zone to the reserve zone or vice versa. A defending unit can be moved from the stronghold to the interior zone, or vice versa. Wavering and disordered units cannot be redeployed. In lieu of redeploying a unit, the besieging army leader can assign it to assault through a breach that does not have a unit assigned to it. In lieu of redeploying one or more units, each leader can **regroup** a unit or units that have **wavered** or become **disordered**, ending those conditions. Heroes can be move like units, but do not count against the leader’s Leadership Ability. The maximum number of units (other than heroes, artillery units, and war machine units) in the assault zone cannot exceed of 1 unit per point of unit capacity plus 1 additional unit per breach in the stronghold
7. **Surrender Phase.** The defending army can now voluntarily surrender. If the defending army surrenders, the stronghold is captured. See **Ending Sieges**. Otherwise, the besieging army can renew the assault or call it off. If the besieging army renews the assault, then another assault turn is fought, starting with step 1. If the besieging army calls off the assault, the assault ends but the siege itself continues.

###### Attack Throw Modifiers during Assaults

In addition the modifiers that apply in battle, unit attack throws are modified by the following factors during an assault:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Attack Throw Modifiers** | **Modifier** |
| Attack by assaulting unit other than artillery, flyer, missile unit, or unit assaulting through a breach | -2 |
| Attack by a defending unit | +2 |

###### Artillery and Siege Equipment During Assaults

| Siege Tower, Standard | 2 | 1 | *2* |
| Siege Tower, Large | 1 | 2 | *2* |
| Siege Tower, Huge | 1 | 8 | *2* |

When used during assaults, artillery and siege equipment must be grouped into units. The number of pieces of artillery or siege equipment required to form a unit depends on the type of artillery or equipment. The unit size and battle rating of artillery and siege equipment units is listed in the Artillery and Siege Equipment Battle Rating table. Artillery and siege equipment not present in sufficient numbers to form a unit do not affect the assault. A leader does not haveto use artillery and siege equipment if he would prefer not to risk it.

EXAMPLE: Moruvai’s defending army fields 2 medium trebuchets, 5 heavy ballista, and 20 light ballista. When his stronghold is assaulted, he forms these into 2 units of 1 medium trebuchet each (BR 2 each), 1 unit of 5 heavy ballista each (BR 6), and 2 units of light ballista (BR 3 each). His artillery adds 2 + 2 + 6 + 3 + 3 =16 to his army’s battle rating.

**Unit Size:**The minimum number of pieces of artillery or siege equipment that must be deployed to have an effect on an assault. For example, deploying one 20’ ram will not have any game effect, but deploying six 20’ rams will increase an army’s BR by 1. For siege equipment of varying size (such as rams), a sufficiently oversized piece can qualify as a unit by itself. For example, a single 120’ ram would have BR 1.

**BR:** Artillery and siege equipment units with a battle rating function exactly like assaulting/defending units for all purposes, except they do not count against the unit capacity restrictions on assault and defense. An army is limited to a maximum BR from siege equipment equal to its BR from assaulting/defending units. (There have to be troops to carry the equipment!)

**Notes:** Some units have special capabilities or restrictions, explained below.

1. Light repeating ballista units can make four attacks during the artillery phase of each assault turn, but the ballistas break down on any unmodified throw of “1”. Broken ballista units are removed from the assault but not destroyed.
2. This war machine can only be deployed by the besieging army.
3. A ram or screw unit can make one attack throw during the melee phase of each assault turn; if the attack succeeds, the unit creates a temporary breach to which an assaulting unit can be assigned in the Redeployment phase. The temporary breach lasts until the besieging army calls off the assault or captures the stronghold.
4. This war machine can only be deployed by the defending army.
5. A cauldron unit provides a bonus attack throw during the melee phase.
6. A gallery or mantlet unit can absorb one hit dealt during any phase of an assault turn. Absorbing a hit destroys the gallery or mantlet unit.
7. A ram catcher can make one attack throw during the missile phase of each battle turn; if the throw succeeds, the unit destroys a ram or screw unit, if any are present.
8. A siege hook reduces the BR of one defending army unit in the melee phase by one for purposes of attacks and hits.

**Acquiring Artillery and Siege Equipment:** If in supply, an army may acquire artillery and siege equipment from the market. Either army may construct artillery and siege equipment as construction projects.

###### Battle Ratings During Assaults

See Chapter 9, **Unit Characteristics Summary** (p. XX), for a list of battle ratings by unit type. All defending units, other than cavalry units, have their BR increased by 1 due to the protection of the stronghold. For example, a unit of heavy infantry (BR 2) defending a stronghold has its BR increased to 3. It will roll three attack throws and will take three hits to eliminate.

Except when assaulting through a breach, assaulting cavalry units have their BR reduced to one-quarter their base value (round up). This represents the fact that they must fight dismounted as half-strength infantry.

###### Besieger Breakthroughs and Defender Sallies

If, at the start of any step (c), Determine Hits*,* the stronghold zone has no units in it, then the besieging army has achieved a **breakthrough.** The assaulting units in that phase can attack units in the interior zone at a +2 bonus to their attack throws. The units in the interior do not get to attack.

Likewise, if at the start of any step (c), the assault zone has no units in it, then the defending army has earned a **sally.** Defending units in that phase can attack units in the reserve zone at a +2 bonus to their attack throws. The units in the reserve do not get to attack.

###### Casualties

When an assault ends, each army’s leader must determine his army’s casualties using the following rules.

**Unit Loss***:*For each unit that was defeated, 50% of its troops (rounded up) are crippled or dead, while the other 50% (rounded down) are lightly wounded. The fate of wounded troops depends on how the assault ended.

If the besieging army captured the stronghold, then its wounded troops are assumed to be treated and recover during the next week. The defending army’s wounded troops become prisoners, as do any surrendering troops. A defending army’s leader may negotiate for other terms during a voluntary surrender, but it will ultimately be up to the besieging army whether these terms are honored.

EXAMPLE: After a brutal assault, the defending army surrenders in the face of overwhelming odds. The defending army began with 10 heavy infantry units. In the course of several assault turns, 7 heavy infantry units (840 men) were defeated. 420 men are crippled or dead, and 420 are prisoners. The remaining 3 units (360 men) also become prisoners.

If the defending army fought off the assault, then its wounded troops recover during the next week. The besieging army’s wounded troops are left behind and become prisoners of the defending army.

EXAMPLE: A besieging army of 20 units has had 8 heavy infantry units (960 troops) defeated in a futile assault. 480 troops are crippled/dead and 480 are wounded and captured by the defending army.

As always, half-strength units may be consolidated to form a smaller number of full-strength units, if desired.

**Prisoners:** Prisoners can be executed, kept as slaves, or ransomed for 40gp each as spoils of war. (Higher level NPCs, monsters, and similar creatures can be ransomed for greater sums, at the Judge’s discretion.) Defending armies usually lack the supplies to feed prisoners, so they will likely be killed or ransomed. Cunning defenders may use prisoners as leverage to negotiate surrender terms.

###### Heroic Forays During Assaults

As with battles, heroes can influence the outcome of assaults by making heroic forays. The mechanics for heroic forays during assaults are identical to those for heroic forays during battles, except as noted below.

**Artillery and Siege Equipment:** Units of artillery and siege equipment can appear as foes for either side. See the Artillery and Siege Equipment Battle Rating table, above,for the battle ratings of various war machines. The effects of artillery and siege equipment on personal combat are as described in Chapter 6 (p. XX).

EXAMPLE: Moruvai makes a heroic foray in defense of his keep during the assault phase. He and his henchmen stake a total of 2 BR. The Judge picks a selection of troops from Marcus and Peristo’s army. He notes that Marcus’s army has deployed a huge 120’ battering ram. The Judge decides that Moruvai’s foray will be to stop a unit of 120 light infantry (1 point of BR) crewing the battering ram (1 BR).

**Defending the Stronghold:** Missile attacks targeting creatures defending the walls of the stronghold suffer a -4 penalty, and the creatures gain a +4 bonus to saving throws versus Blast caused by artillery, burning oil, or similar effects. On a successful saving throw, creatures defending the walls take nodamage, even if the effect would normally deal half damage.

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Terrain Type** | **Artillery Encounter Distance** | **Missile Encounter Distance** | **Melee Encounter Distance** |
| Barrens (any) | 4d20 x 30’ (1260’) | 4d6 x 30’ (420’) | 2d6+1 x 15’ (120’) |
| Desert (rocky) | 6d20 x 30’ (1890’) | 5d6 x 30’ (480’) | 2d6+1 x 15’ (120’) |
| Desert (sandy) | 4d20 x 30’ (1260’) | 5d6 x 30’ (480’) | 2d6+1 x 15’ (120’) |
| Forest (open) | 4d6 x 30’ (420’) | 3d6 x 15’ (160’) | 2d6+1 x 15’ (120’) |
| Forest (closed) | 3d6 x 15’ (160’) | 5d8 x 3’ (70’) | 5d8 x 3’ (70’) |
| Grassland (prairie) | 4d20 x 30’ (1260’) | 4d6 x 30’ (420’) | 2d6+1 x 15’ (120’) |
| Grassland (steppe) | 6d20 x 30’ (1890’) | 5d6 x 30’ (480’) | 2d6+1 x 15’ (120’) |
| Hills (forested) | 3d6 x 15’ (160’) | 5d8 x 3’ (70’) | 5d8 x 3’ (70’) |
| Hills (rocky) | 4d20 x 30’ (1260’) | 4d6 x 30’ (420’) | 2d6+1 x 15’ (120’) |
| Jungle (any) | 5d8 x 3’ (70’) | 5d4 x 3’ (40’) | 5d8 x 3’ (70’) |
| Mountains (forested) | 3d6 x 15’ (157’) | 5d8 x 3’ (70’) | 5d8 x 3’ (70’) |
| Mountains (rocky) | 4d20 x 30’ (1260’) | 4d6 x 30’ (420’) | 2d6+1 x 15’ (120’) |
| Scrubland (low, sparse) | 4d20 x 30’ (1260’) | 4d6 x 30’ (420’) | 2d6+1 x 15’ (120’) |
| Scrubland (high, dense) | 4d6 x 30’ (420’) | 3d6 x 15’ (157’) | 2d6+1 x 15’ (120’) |
| Swamp (marshy) | 4d6 x 30’ (420’) | 3d6 x 15’ (157’) | 2d6+1 x 15’ (120’) |
| Swamp (scrubby) | 3d6 x 15’ (160’) | 5d8 x 3’ (70’) | 5d8 x 3’ (70’) |

**Encounter Distance:** The foray begins with all participants from the defending army inside the stronghold. Participants from the besieging army begin outside, some distance from the stronghold’s walls. The Judge can set the Assault Encounter Distance based on his map of the region or use the Assault Encounter Distance table to determine how far away the foraying heroes are from the stronghold’s walls at the start of the foray. The maximum artillery encounter distance will be equal to or less than the longest-ranged artillery deployed by either side, and the maximum missile encounter distance will not exceed the longest-ranged handheld missile deployed by either side.

EXAMPLE: Moruvai’s stronghold is situated on a rocky hill, and the heroes are foraying during a melee phase. The Judge consults the Assault Encounter Distance table and sees that the foray begins with the heroes 2d6+1 x 15’ from Moruvai’s stronghold. The result is an 8, indicating a distance of 120’.

**Foe Selection:** When picking foes, remember that defending units are worth one additional point of BR each.

EXAMPLE**:** Marcus and Peristo make a heroic foray against Moruvai’s keep. The two heroes and their allies stake a total of 3 BR. Moruvai’s walls are defended by goblin light infantry units. Goblin light infantry normally have a battle rating of 0.5, but as defending units, their battle rating is increased by 1 each, to 1.5. The Judge decides that Marcus and Peristo’s foray will face 2 goblin light infantry units (BR 1.5 x 2 = 3).

###### Withdrawal

Loose units aren’t deployed to hold ground or fight to the last man. When applying hits to his units during the artillery or missile phase, the army leader will count loose units as having only half their BR. However, instead of being killed, the units withdraw to the reserve or interior, where they become **disordered**. Place the unit in the reserve or interior, and mark it with a token to represent its disordered state. A disordered unit cannot be redeployed until it is rallied. A unit cannot be rallied and redeployed in the same battle turn. A loose unit that is being attack in the reserve by a sally, or attacked in the interior by a breakthrough, cannot withdraw. A loose unit cannot withdraw during the assault phase. In such cases, the loose units apply their full BR when counting hits.

### Special Rules for Dungeon Assaults

Assaults on dungeons or other underground structures are considerably more dangerous and difficult than assaults on castles, keeps, and towers. The following special rules apply:

* Catapults, trebuchets, and siege towers cannot be used in dungeon assaults.
* Each and every entrance to the dungeon (including entrances created by an earlier breach) counts as separate assault zone for the besieger and a separate wall zone for the defender. The besieger still has just one reserve zone and the defender still has just one interior zone that connect to these zones.
* The besieger can deploy 1 unit to each assault zone but only if the zone’s dungeon entrance is known and accessible to the besieger. The defending army can deploy 1 unit to each wall zone.
* All units act in the melee phase regardless of type.
* If, at the start of step (c), Determine Hits*,* a wall zone does not have a defending unit in it, then the assaulting unit in the opposing assault zone can conduct a breakthrough attack against the interior at a +2 bonus to its attack throws. The units in the interior do not get to attack.
* If, at the start of step (c), Determine Hits*,* an assault zone does not have an assaulting unit in, then the defending unit in the opposing wall zone can conduct a sally against the reserve at a +2 bonus to its attack throws. Since a besieger cannot assign units to an unknown entrance, a defender can always make a sally from that dungeon entrance. However, the sally automatically reveals the location of the entrance to the besieging army.

## Ending Sieges

A siege ends when (1) the defending army sallies forth and gives battle to the besieging army; (2) the defending army surrenders; (3) the besieging army departs the hex; (4) the besieging army captures or destroys the stronghold.

### Defending Army Sallies Forth

A siege can be ended by the defending army if it exits the stronghold and gives battle. Even if greatly outnumbered, a defending army might sally forth if it has run out of supplies, or if the besieging army will be reinforced soon. As soon as the defending army sallies forth, it must immediately fight a **pitched battle** against the besieging army. See Chapter 11, **Resolving Battles** (p. XX).

If the defending army loses the pitched battle, it may retreat back into the stronghold, or retreat into an adjacent 6-mile hex, but is subject to pursuit either way. If the defending army wins the battle, the besieging army is subject to the normal rules for retreat and pursuit.

### Defending Army Surrenders

A siege can be ended by the defending army if it surrenders. Surrender can be voluntary or involuntary. A voluntary surrender occurs when the defending army’s leader negotiates surrender with the besieging army’s leader. An involuntary surrender occurs when all of the units within the stronghold fail loyalty rolls due to calamities. An army leader is likely to get better terms if he surrenders while a portion of his force is still intact, so a leader who sees his supplies dwindling and his army’s morale collapsing may choose to voluntarily surrender to avoid an involuntary surrender later. Either way, the besieging army has won the siege.

### Besieging Army Departs the Hex

A siege can be ended by the besieging army if it departs the hex with all of its units. If this occurs, the defending army has won the siege. The besieging army can continue the siege, however, simply by leaving a unit in the hex (assuming there is sufficient circumvallation). Such a scant force may invite the defending army to sally forth, of course.

### Besieging Army Captures the Stronghold

A siege can be ended by the besieging army if it captures or destroys the stronghold. A stronghold can be captured by assault, or destroyed by reduction. Either way, the besieging army has won the siege.

A stronghold is captured in an assault whenever all of the defending units are defeated and there are no units in reserve. If at least one defending unit remains undefeated after the assault, the stronghold has held.

A stronghold is destroyed by reduction when its structural hit points are reduced to 0. Any defending units in the stronghold must either sally forth or surrender when this occurs.

### Spoils of Sieges

As with a battle, the spoils of war from a victorious siege are equal to one month’s wages of each defeated unit. In addition, each prisoner captured is worth 40gp if sold as a slave or ransomed. Experience points are assigned as with a battle. See Chapter 11, **Spoils of War** (p. XX).

In addition to the spoils taken from the dead troops, the stronghold and domain itself can be a rich source of plunder. A victorious besieger may pillage the domain. See Chapter 10, **Pillaging Domains** (p. XX). Again, terms of a voluntary surrender may forbid the besieger from pillaging the domain, but whether this agreement is honored will depend on the besieger.

## Sieges, Simplified

It isn’t always important to know howa siege was fought — sometimes all that matter is who won and how long it took. The Duration of Siege table is designed for just these occasions!

To use the table, cross-reference the besieged stronghold’s structural hit points with the besieging army’s unit advantage. A numerical result indicates the number of days it will take the besieging army to capture the stronghold. A result of “0” indicates the stronghold is captured without a fight. A result of “-“ indicates that the besieging army is not strong enough to capture the stronghold and can hope only to starve out the defenders with a blockade.

Unit advantage is calculated by subtracting the number of units in the defending army from the number of units in the besieging army. Artillery and siege engines on either side count as bonus units, as shown on the adjacent table.

EXAMPLE: Moruvai’s stronghold (24,000 shp) is under siege by Marcus. Marcus has 50 units. He also has 4 light catapults and 2 light trebuchets. These count as [(4 x 1) + (2 x 8)] 20 bonus units, giving Marcus a total of 70 units. Moruvai’s army has 12 units. Moruvai also has 4 medium catapults, which count as (4 x 2) 8 bonus units. Moruvai has a total of 20 units. Marcus’s unit advantage is (70 - 20) 50 units. Cross referencing Marcus’ unit advantage of 50 with the stronghold’s 24,000 shp, the Judge sees that it will take 18 days for Marcus to capture Moruvai’s stronghold.

A stronghold situated on a mountain, island, or similar piece of inaccessible terrain is harder to capture than its structural hit points would indicate. Modify the duration of the siege as shown on the table below.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Stronghold Site** | **Duration Modifier** |
| Mountain (Sogdian Rock, the Acropolis) | x5 |
| Island (Tyre, Mont. St. Michel) | x4 |
| Peninsula (Constantinople) | x3 |
| Riverbank (Rhine river castles) | x2 |

EXAMPLE: If Moruvai’s stronghold were an island-fortress, it would take Marcus 72 days to capture it instead of 18.

|  |  |

| **Artillery / Siege Equipment** | **Bonus Units** |
| Ballista, Light (10) | 1 |
| Ballista, Medium (5) | 1 |
| Ballista, Heavy (5) | 3 |

| Siege Tower, Large | 2 |
| Siege Tower, Huge | 8 |
| Trebuchet, Light (2) | 2 |
| Trebuchet, Medium | 3 |
| Trebuchet, Heavy | 6 |

To assess the casualties resulting from a completed siege, just resolve a battle (not an assault) between the besieging army and defending army. This represents, e.g., the defending army sallying forth when all hope is lost, the besieging army mopping up after the stronghold is reduced, and so on. Play the final battle as normal, with two exceptions related to morale collapse. Defending units which suffer a Flee result are assumed to be cowering in the rubble rather than actually putting any distance between themselves and the encircling attackers. Defenders which suffer a Rout result are considered to have surrendered to the besieging army, whose commander may determine the unit’s fate.

This table is especially useful for resolve sieges that are happening “off camera,” away from the activities of player characters. Should the PCs intervene in the siege, the Judge can calculate the state of the defending stronghold’s walls and supplies at the point when the PCs arrive. The stronghold will be reduced to 0 shp when the listed number of days has occurred, reduced to 50% of its shp when half the time has elapsed, and so on.

**Designer’s Note**: The unit bonus afforded by artillery in sieges is not intended to match up 1:1 with the Battle Rating provided by artillery used in assaults. Ballista are more accurate against enemy units that catapults and trebuchets, but catapults and trebuchets are more effective against structures. There’s mathematical magic behind the scenes that yields these numbers.

# Appendix A: Auran Empire

Welcome to a world of adventure, where a once-majestic empire is slipping into oblivion, and bold and ambitious conquerors are rising to forge new realms from the ashes of the old. This Appendix summarizes the information that a well-educated Auran patrician would know about his world. The ***AX*** line of adventure scenarios and various articles in ***Axioms***magazine, all available separately from Autarch, provide more detail about the setting, but this should be enough to get you started!

## Overview

For three thousand years, the continent of Aurëpos has been ruled by a succession of empires. For the last four centuries, the Auran Empire has been hegemonic, extending the rule of law with might and magic. But, starting about a hundred years ago, the imperial peace became marred by eruptions of violence that cost the empire half its provinces and power. Then, four years ago, a new foe arose in the west: The Skysos, horse nomads united under a great kaǧan and come to devour the very marrow of civilization. In response, the Tarkaun of Aura took the legions west, leaving the empire but thinly guarded by the meager garrisons that remain. Last year, raiders and pirates began striking directly against the Empire’s coastal settlements; the poorly-manned border forts began to fall prey to invading beastmen; and rumors began to trickle eastward that the Auran forces have been encircled and destroyed by the Skysos. Rather than looking to the defense of the realm, the great and powerful of the Empire have turned on each other like jackals feasting on carrion…

## Lands

According to the cartographers of Aura, Cybele has four continents: Aurëpos, Ithea, Ulruk, and Danea. The continent of Aurëpos (“Continent by the Sea” in the Classical tongue), so named because it encircles the great inland sea called the Ammas Aurë (“Sea of Serenity”), lies at the epicenter of the other continents, and enjoys the mildest climate and most fertile soil in the known world. Ulruk lies to the south of Aurëpos, Danea to the north, and Ithea to the west.

The dominant power on Aurëpos is the Auran Empire. Over 21,000,000 souls live within the Empire’s borders, and over 500,000 residents dwell in its majestic capital, Aura (“Dawn”). Founded over 1,300 years ago, the city of Aura encompasses the entirety of a large island just off the northern tip of Tirenea. The city encircles Mt. Audarammas (“Serene Light of the Morning”), the sacred mountain, site of the Golden Temple of the Winged Sun, and extends onto the mainland by means of a great causeway. Mainland Tirenea (“Land of Crowns”) itself is the richest, most populated province of the Auran Empire. Tirenea is a hilly, fertile land with many harbors and cities, the Jewel of the World.

Visible from the shores of Tirenea is Corcano (“Tree Fields”), a black island of palms and olive trees with active volcanoes and rocky slopes. The Corcanoans are predominantly fishermen and merchants, plying the trade routes to and from Aura, though the island itself is most famous for the colossal automaton that stands guard over its shores.

West of Tirenea lies Nicea (“Hill Land”), a rocky province of the Empire with cities nestled at the foothills of the rugged Achaean Mountains. These peaks grow ever fiercer as they run southward, transforming eventually into the great Meniri (“Mountains of Rock”), which explode east and west, forming a barrier between the civilized lands of the Ammas Aurë and the Waste beyond.

Adjoining Nicea in the west is Opelenea (“Majestic Land”), an arid realm of palms and dates with beautiful beaches, high hills, and stark deserts. For centuries, Opelenea has been the gateway between the Sunset Kingdoms of the west and the Empire of the east, its purple-sailed ships and caravans of camels carrying goods across the known world. Though nominally ruled by the Empire, Opelenea’s city-states and nomad tribes retain considerable autonomy, and Auran law often gives way to their ancient customs.

West of Opelenea is Kemesh (“River Land” in Old Kemeshi), last surviving satrapy of the ancient and sinister Kingdom of Zahar. It is a bleak realm where sorcerer-priests build cenotaphs on the backs of thousands, and evil spirits linger in silent tombs of stone. Kemesh’s power has waxed and waned over the millennia, but has never wavered in its malignancy and despotism.

To the south of Kemesh, in Ulruk, are the Ivory Kingdoms of Keita, Munde, and Kushtu, lands rich in salt, copper, gold, dates, and ivory. Shebatea (“Aromatic Land”) lies west of the Ivory Kingdoms, across the Narrow Sea. From this desert realm, the Sunset Kingdoms import slaves and courtesans, cinnamon and cassia, frankincense and myrrh.

North of Shebatea and north-west of Kemesh lies dusky Somirea (“Land of the Darkening Sky”), the most populous of the Sunset Kingdoms. A proud land with ancient traditions of mysticism, Somirea has fielded armies of war elephants and archers against the Auran Empire in many wars throughout history. Today Aura and Somirea are allied against the menacing hordes of the Skysos.

The Skysos hail from a vast steppe to the west, called Skysostan in the tongue of the Somireans. The Skysos have always been a dangerous people, but also a divided one, with their various tribes traditionally set against each other by the monarchs of the Sunset Kingdoms. Such factitiousness is now in the past, for the Skysos have united under a great kaǧan and seek a place for themselves among the great powers of Aurëpos.

North of Somirea and Skysostan lies Celdorea (“Land of the Wealthy”), a decadent land of greed, opulence, and treachery, thick with traders and slavers. Its capital is the great port-city of Zidium, from which it controls access to the rich resources of the Comean Sea. Celdorea was once the dominant power in the Ammas Aurë, but lost its maritime empire three centuries ago to the rising power of Aura.

Celdorea has recently taken advantage of the Empire’s overextension to reclaim its ancient control of the Syrnasos (“Flowering Isles”), an archipelago of islands glittering across the Ammas Aurë. The Syrnasans are famous for their skill with slings and ships, but notorious as pirates and thieves. Their storytellers claim that the ruins of an ancient civilization of winged men can be found on the remote peaks of their islands. Many explorers have sought out these ruins, hoping to learn the secrets of the Day Without Night, but few have returned, and none with answers.

North of the Syrnasos, east of Celdorea, is a collection of barbarian realms stretching from the coast to the rugged foothills of the perilous Jutting Mountains. Once the Auran province of Dappakosea, the region was conquered a century ago by a coalition of Danean tribes collectively known as the Jutlanders. These barbarians drove off the Auran legions and enslaved the native Dappakosean populace. Today the so-called Kingdoms of Jutland are aggressive and expansionist; their dragon-prowed raiding ships are becoming feared throughout the Ammas Aurë. Were the Jutlanders to be united by a high king, they might topple the thrones of Aurëpos.

The Kingdom of Rorn lies east of Jutland. Formerly the Auran province of Ivorea, Rorn became an independent realm when the Auran legions were driven off by the Jutlanders. Rorn might have fallen to the barbarians, too, had a great captain, Arëtar Pendaelen, not risen to rally the native Rornish tribes and halt the invaders. Rorn remains under constant threat from its bloody-minded neighbor but for now its stout people have maintained their freedom. Though never fully assimilated into Auran culture, Rorn still benefits from much of the old Auran infrastructure. Its culture mixes Auran civilization and Rornish folk-ways with the sylvan influence of the elves of Northern Argollë (“Eastern Light”).

Northern Argollë is the last remaining kingdom of the elves. Lying just east of Rorn, it is a beautiful realm of coastal and mountain forests, dotted by sylvan cities hidden amidst the woods. The dawn redwoods that grow on the ocean coast of Northern Argollë are said to be the most magnificent trees in all of Cybele, though few men are ever invited to see them.

The Pillars of Dawn separate Northern Argollë from the rolling hills of Southern Argollë. In ancient days, Southern Argollë was the forested heartland of the ancient Argollëan Empire, but the elves and the forests have both largely been eliminated. Nowadays it is the easternmost province of the Auran Empire. Southern Argollë extends eastward to the Tëhonaurë (“Deep Ocean”), which expands endlessly outward to the rising sun.

Bordering Southern Argollë to the south-west is Krysea (“Arrow-Land”), a stark, rugged country known for its stout archers and mercenaries. Now a loyal province of the Empire, Krysea resisted Auran dominance for over one hundred years. The remnants of the old border forts of the Krysean Wars still dot the landscape.

South-east of Krysea and Southern Argollë spread the black-faced Zaqāru Mountains (“Area Raised Above All Others” in Ancient Zaharan). Fiercely sloped in the west, the Zaqāru descend gently in the east, thereby forming the great plateau which was in ancient days the land of Zahar. Now that once-fertile highland has been reduced to ruin and become part of the great **Waste** that spans the breadth of the continent. The Waste is a dry and wind-blasted desert dotted here and there by ancient ruins said to date from before the Day Without Night, and populated by monstrous beasts, undead evils, and savage clans of barbarian beastmen who live for plunder and rapine.

Along the border between the Empire and the Waste, two rivers — the **Krysivor** (“Arrow River”) and the **Mirmen** (“Black Rock”) — run northeast from the Meniri Mountains down to the Tëhonaurë. The region between the mountains, the ocean, and the two rivers is known as the **Borderlands**. The Borderlands has been contested throughout recorded history and its landscape is littered with ancient fortresses, blood-soaked battlefields, and dread ruins, crumbling relics of the empires that once ruled there.

The Borderlands is secured by a fortified line of forts, but even when these have been fully manned, it has never been an entirely secure region. With so many Imperial legions sent west to confront the Skysos, the dangers facing the Borderlands are greater than ever. Monsters are slipping across the porous border to terrorize and plunder. Travel has grown perilous, and the border forts are becoming increasingly isolated and outmatched. The power structure of the region has begun decentralizing to local warlords and private armies.

**Note:** The centuries and years in this adventure are denoted either BE (Before Empire) or IY (Imperial Year), which respectively descend to and ascend from the founding of the Auran Empire. You can correlate these to the Western calendar’s BC and AD dating system. For instance, 2500 BE is approximately similar to the time in our own world when the great pyramid was completed and Assyria was founded.

## Customs

###### Laws and Governance

Graven in stone in the Temple of Türas in 515 BE, the Code and Laws of Aura vested the governance of the city in its Senate. This deliberative body was drawn from the city’s most respected and influential citizens and was empowered to levy taxes, raise armies, wage war, pass laws, and administer justice. During time of war, the Senate would temporarily delegate its executive powers to an Exarch, who served for the duration of the campaign or until removed from office by a vote of the Senate.

By the close of the Second Celdorean War (1 BE), Aura had gained military control of Tirenea, Nicea, Krysea, Dappakosea (present-day Jutland) and Ivorea (present-day Rorn). This vast territory was legally governed by the Senate until the beginning of the imperial era (0 IY). At that time, Exarch Audarius Valerian Tarkaun was awarded with executive power for life in order to re-establish order within Aura’s newly-established empire. After Tarkaun was assassinated in 3 IY, a bloody civil war erupted amongst the senate. The victor, Gaius Valerian, adopted the honorific Tarkaun and took the same powers as his predecessor. In the subsequent centuries since then, Aura has been governed by a Tarkaun.

Since the reign of Ulkyreus (215 – 257 IY), the Tarkaun has held almost absolute power, with the various Exarchs serving as military governors and the Senate limited to a largely advisory capacity. The Tarkaun’s will is enforced by the black-cloaked Emperor’s Talons, the elite agents of the Empire. Answering directly and only to the Tarkaun, the Emperor’s Talons are the eyes, the voice, and when necessary, the iron fist of imperial rule.

###### Coins and Money

The common coin of the Auran Empire is the copper crown. 10 coppers make up 1 silver eagle, and 10 silver eagles are worth 1 gold sun. 1 gold sun is worth 100 copper crowns. Each coin weighs approximately 0.01 lbs.

Very large sums of money are generally referenced in gold talents. A talent is derived from a weight equal to the weight of water in an amphora, roughly 60 lbs, or 6,000 coins. A gold talent is worth 6,000 gold suns, 60,000 silver eagles, or 600,000 copper crowns.

The ancient Zaharans also used platinum and electrum coins as money, and these ancient pieces are sometimes found in treasure hoards. Following with Zaharan tradition, Kemesh, Somirea, and Celdorea also mint platinum and electrum coins, worth around 5 gold suns and 5 silver eagles respectively. These are viewed with some suspicion by Auran merchants.

###### Fashion and Dress

The Auran Empire is a wealthy, opulent, and status-conscious culture and its fashion reflects the noble and merchant classes’ desire to display their power and affluence. While the peasants wear sheepskin and woven wool, the aristocracy enjoys tailored clothes of soft linen, fine cotton, and rich silk, with buttery polished leather used for footwear and structured garments. Embroidery, etching, and ornament are common, with geometric patterns, animals, and religious symbols dominant.

The majority of the Empire is centered in warm, dry climates, so fashions can be quite revealing, and classical beauty of body and face is prized and treasured. This is true for both men and women; status is heavily influenced by lineage and spiritual power, and women are equal in both.

Common women wear loose, sleeveless shifts of knee- to ankle-length with cloth belts and breastbands and low leather sandals. Their hair is traditionally worn long but tied back in simple buns or braids. Aristocratic women wear elaborately-decorated garments draped around their bodies in a variety of alluring configurations, often accompanied by tight girdles of ornamented leather or metal and high strappy sandals. Heeled footware was developed a few decades ago to instant acclaim by the nobility. Piercings of the ear, nose, and lips are common, as are anklets, armlets, bracelets, chokers, circlets, necklaces, rings, and tiaras. Upper class women wear their hair long and elaborately coiffed, with dramatic colorations in vogue.

Men typically wear knee-length sleeveless or short-sleeved tunics with waist seams, the lower portion of the tunic generally split into two panels for mobility. In formal circumstances men often add luxurious long-sleeved robes over the tunic, but for travel semicircular or oblong cloaks are more common. In the field, military cloaks are generally worn pinned on one shoulder for ease of movement and access to a sword.

High boots or sandals are popular among noble men, while commoners wear low boots or sandals with leggings in cold weather. Sashes with buckles are common and usually very ornamental. Men’s hair is customarily kept short and neat, with faces kept clean shaven or with neatly-groomed facial hair. Armlets, rings, and brooches are common for noble men.

For both sexes, favored colors include cloud white, sunset red, sunrise pink, twilight purple, and sky blue, along with jewel tones of ruby red, topaz yellow, amethyst purple, emerald green, and sapphire blue. Black and gold are considered martial colors, reflecting the coloration of the gold eagle. Grey is considered the color of death and is worn only during mourning.

###### Slavery and Indenture

Slavery, as it is practiced in Celdorea, Somirea, Kemesh, the Ivory Kingdoms, and the Kingdoms of Jutland, does not legally exist within the Auran Empire. However, foreign nobles mock the Auran pretension that “there is no slavery in Aura,” because lifelong indentured servitude is widespread and fulfills a similar economic and cultural role.

Indenturing is the process of selling oneself into servitude, and indenture is the state of being a servant. At any time, any man or woman may sell themselves into indenture; the proceeds of the sale may be assigned to the indentured servant’s spouse, parents, or children, to the satisfaction of his creditors, or otherwise as the indenture agreement dictates. Indenture is generally for 1 year, 7 years, or 21 years, though in principle any term may be devised. Lifelong indenture is imposed by the state on violent criminals, with eternal indenture (which gives the master and his heirs the right to the servant’s services even after death) reserved for heretics and traitors.

###### Taxation

Empires are maintained with iron and gold – iron to wage war and gold to fund it. To assure that the Empire is never short of gold, the imperial officers who govern its various exarchates, prefectures, and other domains are expected to collect fees upon marriage, inheritance, birth and death, harvest, and other occasions; to levy fines and fees for administering justice; to charge tolls for the roads; to charge duties on merchants in their markets; and to extract (directly or via forced labor) grain, ore, and timber from those working their land. From these funds, the ruler is obligated to send a tributary payment to his superiors. The remainder is expected to be used to maintain a garrison and stronghold in the domain; to support the local temples; and to pay for the ceremonial games, sporting events, religious feasts, country festivals, and other public works that demonstrate the greatness of Auran civilization.

Auran jurists are often called upon to decide the rightful owner of treasure recovered by exploration and warfare. Ancient law, dating back to the Empyrean War, holds that half of all treasure lawfully recovered inside the Empire belongs to those who recovered it, while the other half belongs to those who own the land upon which it was found – either the private owner or the Empire itself. Often, however, local rulers will waive these taxes, or at least look the other way, if adventurers protecting their lands from monsters recover some treasure from their victories. Treasure lawfully recovered outside the Empire, of course, belongs entirely to those who recovered it. Treasure unlawfully taken from the Empire or its peoples is not (legally) treasure at all, but stolen goods!

###### Travel and Vehicles

The Empire’s paved roads, built over centuries of expansion, are said to be over five thousand miles in total length. The Imperial Cartography Service maintains extensive maps of the countryside, roadways, and even street maps; much of the Empire is correspondingly easy to get around within, or was until recently.

Travel along the roads is commonly by foot or horse. Wealthier citizens may also travel by servant-borne litter or by chariot or covered carriage. Merchants generally rely on large, four- or six-wheeled wagons drawn by teams of horses or oxen. On the sea-lanes, most merchant vessels are square-rigged sailing ships, while warships are generally galleys with multiple sets of oars for increased maneuverability and speed.

###### Engineering and Construction

The Auran Empire is the most technologically sophisticated realm in the known world. In architecture, Aura builds with stone, brick, cement, and concrete, with accents of bronze, brass, and alabaster. Common architectural motifs include the dome (symbolizing the sky), the column, the atrium, and the reflecting pool. All four of these motifs appear in the Golden Temple of the Winged Sun on Mt. Audarammas, and in the Imperial Palace on the Pallatium.

Also noteworthy are the many great amphitheaters and coliseums in the cities of the Empire. Wonders of Auran acoustic engineering, each is able to seat tens of thousands, yet capable of projecting a man’s voice from the center of the stage to the farthest backrow. The Great Lighthouse of Pireus, with its ever-burning elemental flame visible from leagues away, is representative of the heights of Imperial skill, though many smaller lighthouses exist.

Perhaps most of all, the Empire is known for its marvelous aqueducts, dams, and bridges, which control and traverse the waterways of the Empire. Sewers of mind-numbing complexity run under the Empire’s great cities, connecting with the aqueducts and canals. Water wheels and wind mills turn fluid movement into power, and hydraulic pumps and siphons transform power into movement. Because of these sophisticated waterworks, the citizens of Aura enjoy public baths with warm, hot, and cold water as well as bronze indoor plumbing with flush toilets. Fire engines with hydraulic pumps protect its cities against the scourges of fire.

###### Knowledge and Learning

Since the city’s founding, Aura’s scholars have created and collected great works on law, rhetoric, ethics, political economy, natural history, natural philosophy, and mathematics. Before it was burned by Baal the Terrible in 16 BE, the Great Library of Aura contained 700,000 works, with thirteen lecture halls for up to 5,000 students. Only a fraction now survives, but even this leaves Aura as the center of knowledge in the world.

Its astronomers know the true length of the year and have maintained accurate calendars for centuries. They track the precession of the heavens and have cataloged the stars and constellations. Auran physicists have working theories of motion, statics, mechanics, and optics. Auran mathematicians have codified arithmetic, geometry, trigonometry, and algebra for use by engineers. They understand both zero and infinity, though they have only barely plumbed the secret of the infinitesimal calculus and the metaphysics of time, space, and reality.

The philosophers and scholars of Aura have also created marvels of mechanics and miniaturization. The Tower of Knowledge is renowned for its great Orrery, a clockwork mechanical device that illustrates the motions of the planets around the Celestial Sphere. Mechanical calculators for astrology have been created that are small enough to fit in a chest. Automated doors that open acoustically are used in royal buildings. Most impressive of all is the colossal automaton that guards the island of Corcano, a unique product of magic and engineering never since duplicated in history.

Auran medicine is as advanced as its mechanics. Physicians practicing dissection and surgery have discovered the function of the heart, lungs, brain, and other major organs and systems. Forceps, scalpels, scissors, cauterizers, and bandages are all available to the skilled physicker. Herbal remedies are used for pain, as well as recreation, and hallucinogens and stimulants are brewed for chewing, smoking, or ingestion. Sterilization is well understood, and makes the Empire’s surgical procedures much safer. Surgical skill, herbal medicine, and divine magic combined mean that the rich of Aura can be healed of almost any injury or illness.

###### Weapons and Warfare

For over four hundred years, the Auran Army has been the known world’s best fighting force. Its legionary infantry are the unyielding anvil upon which barbarian hordes are broken; its cataphract cavalry are the unstoppable hammer with which the breaking blow is swung.

Often the most heavily-armored infantrymen on the field, Auran legionaries wear banded plate cuirasses and spaulders with steel vambraces, steel greaves, and studded leather aprons. Their primary weapons are 8’ ash-wood spears with steel leaf-shaped heads and bronze butt-spikes. The legionaries’ secondary weapons are imperial short swords — 30” double-edged straight blades of Auran steel, used for slashing and thrusting. These weapons are used one-handed in conjunction with curved oval shields, 4’ x 2’6” in size, made of leather-wrapped hardwood with bronze bosses. By tradition, legionary shields are painted red and emblazoned with the golden winged sun of Ammonar. Helmets are commonly worn by all legionaries, and are generally open-faced and utilitarian. Subalterns and centurions have more ornate helms featuring horse-hair plumage or metal crests.

Cataphracts are even more heavily armored than legionaries, with steel muscle cuirasses over mail on their torsos, studded leather war-skirts over their hips, segmented steel plates over mail on their arms and legs, and steel helms with horse-hair plumage and sculpted face masks on their heads. This armor is typically lacquered gold and supplemented by round, leather-wrapped hardwood shields with bronze bosses. Their horses are equally armored with lamellar barding from head to hoof. The cataphracts’ weapons include 12’ lances with wooden shafts and steel spearheads at either end; composite reflex bows featuring unbendable horn grips with reinforced wooden bowstaves slung in reverse of the bows’ natural flex; and imperial swords of similar make to the legionaries’, albeit longer (36 – 40”) and more ornately decorated.

Distinct from the legions, but no less deadly, are the bladedancers of Ianna, goddess of love and war. In single combat or loose formations, bladedancers fight with dual 30” single-edged curved blades designed for cutting and slashing, known as warblades. The best warblades are made of folded steel using secret techniques known only to the master smiths of the Temple of the Blade. Ancient warblades may have been in families for generations. In close-order formation, bladedancers fight with glaives: Long, sleek single-edged blades with thrusting tips attached to extremely long hilt. Glaives allow for tremendously powerful attacks from horseback or afoot, and are light enough for use both cutting and slashing.

For the past century, the Auran Army has numbered about 370,000 troops, of which about 200,000 are stationed on the frontier, 150,000 are stationed within its borders, and 20,000 are stationed in Aura itself. However, more than 270,000 of the Empire’s soldiers have been dispatched west to fight the Skysos in Somirea. This has left the Empire itself only thinly defended against the Jutlandic raiders and beastman barbarians that threaten it. If the doomsayers are right that the Auran Army has been destroyed in the west, then the Empire is in grave peril…

###### Religion and Myth

The Aurans acknowledge the existence of two pantheons of powerful deities, the Empyrean and the Chthonic. In general, the Empyrean powers are associated with law, light, and creation, while the Chthonic powers are associated with chaos, darkness, and destruction. The Empyrean gods are revered and worshipped while the Chthonic powers are feared and reviled. The situation is reversed in the Sunset Kingdoms, which tend to venerate the Chthonic powers foremost.

The Empyrean faiths teach that after death, the body must be burned so that Calefa can swiftly usher the soul to the afterlife, where its valor is weighed by Türas. Base and sordid souls drink of the waters of sorrow and return again to the realms of man in a new body. Noble, heroic souls pass to the Empyrean Heaven, to dwell in the glory of the halls of Ammonar. The Exalted (as they are called) are venerated by their descendants and often asked to intercede with the gods on their behalf, and Exalted emperors and heroes may be widely worshipped as demi-gods in their own right.

The Chthonic faithful do not believe in this cycle of life, death and rebirth. They believe that upon death, the soul is consumed and used as fuel in the creation of new life. They see reincarnation of the soul the same way one sees fungus growing in a corpse — new life, yes, but not the same life. They see, not a choice between paradisiac afterlife and worldly reincarnation, but between undeath and oblivion. They thus seek to keep their souls and their bodies intact lest their singular identity be destroyed by the cycle of death before the time of the Awakening. The Awakening is a prophesized future when the Chthonic gods shall return to the earth and the faithful shall enjoy a true bodily resurrection. The day of this Awakening is unknown. Some sects claim it can be known by the movements of the stars, others only by the will of the gods.

The Gods and Goddesses table, below, lists the 7 Empyrean and 11 Chthonic powers, along with their titles, spheres of influence, holy symbols, and sacred animals, as they are most commonly known to the Auran Empire. Roughly analogous deities sit in approximately similar roles in other religions of Cybele. Based on these resemblances, some philosophers have asserted the existence of an underlying unity of all religious traditions, in which there are only a small number of great powers, all known by different names in different civilizations. There are, of course, other lesser deities, demigods, heroes, spirits, and idols worshipped throughout Cybele that are too numerous to name here.

###### Clergy and Churches

Within the Auran Empire, there are seven main religious orders, one for each of the seven Empyrean gods:

* **The Temple of the Winged Sun**, sacred to Ammonar, is the largest and most powerful of the crusader orders. Its clergy are common throughout the Empire, where they proselytize the Empyrean faith, crusade against its foes, and minister to the needs of the faithful.
* **The Temple of Justice**, sacred to Türas, is feared and respected throughout the realm for its stern justice and inexorable lawfulness. Its crusaders, known as templars, are commonly found as exorcists, undead slayers, judges, inquisitors, and executioners.
* **The Keepers of the Hearth Fire**, sacred to Mityara, are perhaps the most revered of the orders. The priestesses of this virgin sisterhood maintain the sacred fires and pure waters of the city, regulate the public morals, oversee marriages and births, and supervise hospitals, orphanages, and almshouses. The Keepers have the power to grant mercy to convicted criminals, which often places them in opposition to the less-merciful Temple of Justice and Order of the Eclipse.
* **The Temple of the Blade and the Veil**, sacred to Ianna, is actually two orders in one, reflecting Ianna’s dualistic aspects of love and war. The Temple of the Veil employs priestesses as sacred courtesans and advisors to the great noble families. The Temple of the Blade trains bladedancers to serve as an elite fighting force against the chthonic darkness.
* **The** **Sisterhood of Mourning**, sacred to Calefa, manages funerals, oversees wills and estates, and offers prayers for the dead. Its priestesses are commonly called the Grey Sisters due to their ash-hued robes. A lesser-known sect of Calefa also exists, but is never spoken of publicly: **The Order of the Eclipse**, a secretive guild of ancient lineage, whose members usher souls to the afterlife under the terms of ritualized religious contracts of retribution.
* **The Tower of Knowledge**, sacred to Istreus, is a monastic order devoted to philosophy and magic. It maintains the remnants of the Great Library in Aura, and trains able young men and women to be priests, mages, or scholars.
* **The** **Order of Travelers**, sacred to Naurivus, is a mendicant order of wandering monks who have taken vows to carry the light of the Empyrean faith beyond the borders of the Empire. While its numbers are few, the Order claims many surveyors, scouts, and navigators of the wild regions of Cybele as lay brothers.

The default crusader in ***ACKS II***belongs to the Temple of the Winged Sun, the default bladedancer belongs to the Temple of the Blade, and the default priestess belongs to the Keepers of the Hearth Fire. Information about the Order of the Eclipse can be found in ***AX3: Capital of the Borderlands***while information about the Temple of the Blade and Veil can be found in ***Axioms 11****.* Updated rules for playing divine casters belonging to the other orders may appear in future ***Auran Empire***sourcebooks.

## People

Long before the Day Without Night, each of the great continents was home to a distinct tribe of mankind — Aurëposean, Danean, Ithean, Meniran, and Ulrukan. As the Ammas Aurë lies at the center of the world, all of these ancient tribes eventually came to its serene shores, where in time they battled, befriended and bred with one another. From these conquests and unions came the many diverse peoples that dwell in Aurëpos today. The most numerous of these peoples are described below, along with the great demihuman peoples that dwell amongst and alongside them.

###### Celdorean

The great Celdorean people once ruled a thalassocracy that extended across all of northern Aurëpos. Though defeated by Aura centuries ago, they remain numerous in their homeland of Celdorea and the islands of Syrnasos, and in all the port cities and trading towns of the continent.

Celdoreans are tall-statured (men averaging 5’9”) with athletic body builds characterized by broad shoulders and narrow waists. They have long oval-shaped faces with upright foreheads and prominent cheekbones. Overall their facial features are sharp and bony, and often described as hawk-like. Celdorean eyes are deep-set and either almond- or round-shaped, usually colored hazel, brown, or black but sometimes colored a striking green. Their skin color is light brown or olive tanning to dark brown or dark olive. Celdorean hair is straight or wavy, and colored rufous brown, auburn, dark auburn, or brown-black. The men have heavy beard and body hair.

Celdoreans are usually named in Classical Celdorean after a favored relative in the prior generation of the father’s or mother’s family. Celdorean nobles carry hereditary family names, many formed by appending the suffix -ha or -zadeh to the founding ancestor’s name (e.g. Dadarshi of a noble house founded by Jatar might be “Dadarshi Jatarzadeh”). Commoners use patronyms instead of hereditary family names, with sons adding -pur and -apur to their father’s name (e.g. Dadarshi, son of Farhad, would be “Dadarshi Farhadapur”) and women adding -dar or -adar to their father’s name (e.g. Barsine, daughter of Imanish, would be “Barsine Imanishadar”).

**Male Names:** Ardumanish, Dadarshi, Farhad, Haxamanish, Imanish, Jatar, Marduniya, Spitamaneh, Taxmaspada, Vishtaspa

**Female Names**: Ashrafa, Barsine, Darya, Elaheha, Hediyeh, Iotapa, Karani, Malakeh, Stateira, Uparmiya

###### Dwarven (Jutting and Meniri Mountains)

For centuries the stout and cunning dwarven people delved vast vaults in the Meniri and Jutting Mountains, gathering rich ores and creating enduring works of stone and iron. Today, the dwarves are an embattled race, fighting a never-ending war against the fast-breeding beastmen that have invaded their tunnels. Dwindling in number, barely clinging to the last of their holdings, dwarves are rarely seen by mankind. Those that do mingle with men are almost always adventurers of some sort.

The Meniri dwarves are very short-statured (men averaging 4’) but exceptionally stout, weighing as much as adult humans, with broad shoulders and hips, thick-boned limbs, and sturdy digits. They have large, round heads with prominent brows and strong chins. Their eyes are large, round, and very deep set, colored either grey, grey-brown, green, hazel, or light brown. Their skin ranges from medium to very dark brown, ocher, or sienna. Their hair is wavy or curly, and colored chestnut, grey, or black. Both the men and women have heavy beard and body hair. The Jutting dwarves are similar, but their nasal bridges tend to be concave rather than convex, their skin is a shade fairer, and their hair color is dark red, rufous brown, auburn, or brown-black.

Dwarves are usually named in Old Dwarven for a close relative, famous ancestor, or vault hero. In addition to their given name, all dwarves carry a hereditary family name. Each dwarven vault will have a small number of surnames associated with the families of that vault. The vault itself is always named after its founder’s family. A vault founder’s surname carries great prestige among dwarves (e.g. a dwarf named Hurgon Radokh who hails from the vault of Azen Radokh is likely a person of some importance). In addition to their given name and surname, dwarves enjoy collecting sobriquets and nicknames; any dwarf of distinction will carry at least one and sometimes two or three.

**Male Names:** Arsic, Bombor, Denor, Hurgon, Korten, Morto, Norden, Stahlur, Torrad, Wharto

**Female Names:** Arsi, Balla, Dara, Efti, Fili, Klia, Lara, Mora, Shylda, Thora

###### Elven (Argollëan)

Argollëan, or elven, civilization was at an advanced state well before human civilization had progressed past tribal bands. For two thousand years, the Argollëan Empire ruled Aurëpos, until its climactic destruction at the hands of the Thrassians. Today only a single elven kingdom survives, that of Northern Argollë, though scattered fastnesses can still be found in forests throughout Aurëpos. Elves hailing from Northern Argollë style themselves “high elves” and count themselves as the inheritors of their race’s ancient glories. Elves from the outlying fastnesses are generally called “wood elves.” What they lack in arrogance, wood elves more than make up for in reclusiveness.

Argollëan elves are short-statured (men averaging 5’6” in height), but have such lithe, well-proportioned bodies that all other races look ungainly in comparison. They have long heads and heart-shaped faces with high cheekbones, finely-chiseled features, and full lips. Their eyes are almond-shaped and colored grey, blue, violet, green, or amber. Their hair is straight or wavy, and colored platinum, gold, silver, or blue-black. Their eyebrows are slender and they have neither beard nor body hair growth. Elven skin is pale, almost pure white, but suffers neither burning, browning, nor wrinkling — the Argollëans look ever young and fair to the eyes of men.

Elves are always given names in the lilting Classical Argollëan language. Elven men are traditionally named for their paternal relatives, elven women for their maternal ones. Most Argollëans do not use family names. Their men indicate lineage with the patronymic Mag (“son of”) followed by the father’s name (e.g. Aodan, son of Seanan, would be “Aodan Mag Seanan”). Their women use the matronymic Ni (“daughter of”) followed by the mother’s name (e.g. Irial, daughter of Saorla, would be “Irial Ni Saorla”). The identifiers Mag and Ni are sometimes dropped. Elves descended from a famous noble or hero may append the identifier Ua/Ui (“descendant of”) followed by the name of their ancestor (e.g. if Aodan is descended from the great hero Orthanach, he may call himself “Aodan Ua Orthanach”). This practice is most common among the high elven families of Northern Argollë. Ever-suspicious of outsiders, elves who leave Argollë often conceal their lineage and instead use sobriquets in the local tongue (e.g. Aodan might call himself “Aodan Silverhair”).

**Male Names:** Aodan, Brogan, Caoimhin, Eadan, Fionntan, Mainchin, Orthanach, Rigan, Seanan, Tomman

**Female Names:** Arial, Ceara, Dairinn, Enya, Irial, Mornya, Niamh, Riona, Saorla, Una

###### Jutlandic

Since time immemorial, barbarian tribes have dwelled along the lake-shores and riverways of Danae, making commerce with civilized Aurëpos only at their isolated trading posts on the southern slopes of the Jutting Mountains. A century ago they invaded Dappakosea in great numbers, conquering that land and reducing its once-proud people to thralls. Now barbarian kings and warlords rule a wide swath of the northern shores, called the Kingdoms of Jutland. From there, bold Jutlanders set out to seek their fortune as mercenaries, raiders, and traders throughout the civilized realms.

Jutlanders are tall-statured (men averaging 5’10”) with robust body builds characterized by thick necks, broad shoulders and hips, and large-boned limbs. They have wedge- or square-shaped faces with short, steep foreheads, heavy brow ridges, and broad, strong jaws. Civilized peoples find their facial features blunt and harsh. Their eyes are deep-set and colored either grey, light blue, blue, grey-blue, blue-green, or green. Jutlandic hair is straight or wavy, and colored golden blonde, dark blonde, golden brown, or rufous brown. In some regions of northern Jutland, platinum blonde hair and eyes of violet or pale, colorless grey are seen. The Jutlandic skin color ranges from pale to fair. The men have heavy beard and body hair.

Jutlanders are typically named in Old Jutlandic for a famous hero, ancestor, or relative. Instead of hereditary family names, Jutlanders use patronyms formed by adding -sson or -dottir to the father’s name (e.g. Gunnar, son of Olf, would be “Gunnar Olfsson”). Chiefs, heroes, and other persons of distinction may take or be given sobriquets based on their appearance, personality, or deeds (e.g. if Gunnar wins renown for slaughtering many foes, he might be called “Gunnar the Bloody-Handed”).

**Male Names:** Asmund, Brardi, Dagr, Gunnar, Inthorn, Olf, Rannulfr, Sigwulf, Thorfin, Volundr

**Female Names:** Astrid, Brynhild, Dagny, Eira, Ingrid, Katla, Nessa, Signy, Thyra, Unnhild

###### Kemeshi

The Kemeshi people claim to have dwelled on the banks of the River Kem since before the Day Without Night. Whether this is true remains unknown, but the great antiquity of the tombs and temples of their land cannot be denied. The Kemeshi people are common only in their own land and the adjoining kingdoms of Kushtu, Opelenea, Somirea, and Shebatea, though they are sometimes found elsewhere working as scholars, sages, and sorcerers.

Kemeshi are medium-statured (men averaging 5’7”) with slender body builds, characterized by narrow shoulders and hips, long limbs, and slim digits. They have oval-shaped faces with sloping foreheads, slender jaws, prominent chins, and full lips. Kemeshi eyes are almond-shaped and colored light brown, dark brown, or black. Their skin color is medium brown to dark brown. Kemeshi hair is curly or wavy, and colored dark brown or black. The men have scant beard and body hair. Around one-tenth of Kemeshi nobility are pure-blooded Zaharans (see below).

Kemeshi typically carry a given name in Old Kemeshi. Names are held to have sacred power and carefully selected for aesthetic, religious, and symbolic value. The Kemeshi people do not use hereditary family names. Commoners typically carry just one name. Noteworthy individuals distinguish themselves by attaching additional names based on their accomplishments, ancestry, or faith. A Kemeshi ruler might have as many as five names — a given name, a throne name, a patronym, a matronym, and a religious name. Nobility often carry Zaharan names alongside or in lieu of Kemeshi ones.

**Male Names:** Ankhopten, Bukhat, Djeer, Heferu, Khet, Menthu, Nekhep, Rakhapi, Senef, Weptu

**Female Names**: Ameharu, Beshari, Djerti, Khenia, Matati, Netari, Pahaperi, Raya, Samina, Vibaha

###### Krysean

The stout and stoic Krysean people originally hailed from the rugged Drakonir Mountains of south-eastern Aurëpos. For over five hundred years their fate has been intertwined with that of the Auran Empire. Today Kryseans can be found anywhere the Empire is or has been, working as craftsmen, laborers, merchants, and soldiers.

Kryseans are medium-statured (men averaging 5’8”), with athletic to stocky body builds characterized by compact bodies and short, sturdy limbs. They have oval-shaped faces with wide, slightly sloped foreheads and moderately full lips. Kryseans eyes are deep-set and round, with hazel, brown, and dark brown color. Their skin color ranges from light to medium brown, but tans to dark brown. Krysean hair is straight, wavy, or curly, and colored rufous brown, auburn, dark auburn, or brown-black. Their eyebrows tend to be thick and darker than their scalp hair. The men have heavy beard and body hair.

Kryseans are generally named in Classical Krysean after a favored ancestor, a mythic hero, or a close relative. Kryseans do not carry hereditary family names, instead indicating paternity simply by appending their father’s name after their own (e.g. Mandonio, the son of Terkinos, would be “Mandonio Terkinos”). Kryseans who have left their homes may use a toponymic, formed by adding -tar or -atar to the name of their village, town, or city of origin (e.g. Nesca from Kavala may call herself “Nesca Kavalatar”). Kryseans who are citizens of the Empire may take an Auran name, or may Auranize their existing one.

**Male Names:** Aibekeres, Bodilkas, Culchas, Hilerno, Indikortes, Mandonio, Pirreso, Sigilo, Terkinos, Uxentio

**Female Names:** Ausa, Chiomara, Daleninar, Ederata, Isbatara, Kara, Megara, Nesca, Sicounin, Unia

###### Kushtu

The Kingdom of Kushtu is the northernmost of the Ivory Kingdoms. For centuries it has had commerce with Kemesh, Shebatea, and Somirea. Today Kushtu merchants, shamans, and soldiers can be found in all the great cities of Aurëpos.

The Kushtu people of the Ivory Kingdoms are tall-statured (men averaging 5’10”) with slender to athletic body builds, characterized by broad shoulders, narrow hips, and long legs. They have round- or diamond-shaped faces with narrow, steep foreheads, wide cheekbones, round chins, wide mouths, and full lips. Kushtu eyes are large, round, and black. Their glossy skin ranges from coffee-colored to brown-black. Their hair is black and tightly curled. The men have little to no beard and body hair.

Kushtu are usually named in Old Kushtun after a totemic animal, a desired personality trait, or a tribal hero. The Kushtu do not carry hereditary surnames. Chiefs, heroes, and shamans may take or be given a sobriquet after their given name (e.g. if Masamba has outfought a lion, he might be “Masamba the Lion-Hearted”).

**Male Names:** Abimbola, Babtunde, Chiumbo, Isingoma, Jengo, Kwame, Masamba, Olabode, Simba, Tifari

**Female Names**: Ameena, Binta, Denisha, Habika, Kabira, Mandisa, Nakeisha, Rafiya, Safara, Zabia

###### Nicean

The people of Nicea have long plied the Ammas Aurë, counting themselves as one of the great maritime peoples of the continent. Much of the Auran Navy is staffed by Niceans, as were many of its colonies. Today, Niceans can be found in every coastal city and settlement of the Empire and Sunset Kingdoms, as well as in their own pastoral homeland.

Niceans are medium-statured (men averaging 5’8”), with athletic to stocky body builds characterized by compact bodies and sturdy limbs. They have oval-shaped faces with wide, slightly sloped foreheads and moderately full lips. Nicean eyes are deep-set and round, with green, hazel, brown, and dark brown color. Their skin color ranges from light to medium brown, but tans to dark brown. Nicean hair is straight, wavy, or curly, and colored dark blonde, ash brown, dark brown, or black. Their eyebrows tend to be thick and darker than their scalp hair. The men have heavy beard and body hair.

Niceans typically carry a given name in Classical Nicean, often referencing a grandparent, great uncle, or great aunt. In lieu of hereditary family names, they use patronyms formed by adding the suffix -adis, -akis, -atos, -ides, or -poulos to the father’s name (e.g. Metoros, the son of Vason, might be “Metoros Vasonides”). If a Nicean moves to another place he may replace his patronym with his village, town, or city of origin (e.g. if Metoros Vasonides is from Trikala but living in Arganos, he might be called “Metoros Trikala”). Prominent nobles, philosophers, heroes, and other persons of distinction may carry a sobriquet before or after their given name (e.g. if Metoros is a smooth talker, he might be “Metoros Golden-Tongued). Niceans who are citizens of the Empire may take an Auran name or Auranize their existing one.

**Male Names:** Apollonis, Basilio, Damanos, Iannis, Klenos, Metoros, Peristo, Spyros, Thales, Vason

**Female Names:** Acandra, Bassida, Daphyra, Eliona, Iandra, Neoma, Olyma, Selene, Thena, Zene

###### Opelenean

Opelenea has long been the gateway between the Sunset Kingdoms of the West and the Empire of the East, and the Opelenean people are consequently a widespread and well-traveled people. Opelenean merchants trade in every city of Aurëpos; Opelenean sailors crew purple-sailed ships found in every port of the Ammas Aurë; and Opelenean caravaneers traverse the sands of Shebatea, Kemesh, and even the Waste.

Opeleneans are medium-statured (men averaging 5’7”) with stocky body builds characterized by square-built frames and short, sturdy limbs. They have oval- or ellipse-shaped faces with moderately sloped foreheads and full lips. Opelenean eyes are large and almond-shaped, with hazel, brown, or dark brown color. Their skin color ranges from medium to dark brown. Opelenean hair is wavy or curly, and colored dark brown or black, with ash brown or dark blonde occasionally seen. Their eyebrows tend to be thick and darker than their scalp hair. The men have heavy beard and body hair. Years of the slave trade have given many Opeleneans traces of foreign blood, so Danean, Ithean, or Ulrukan hair, eye, and skin coloration and facial features are not uncommon.

Opeleneans are traditionally given names in Old Opelenean, typically taking a grandparent’s, great uncle’s, or great aunt’s name. They do not use family names, instead indicating lineage by attaching the patronymic Bar (“son of”) or Bat (“daughter of”) to their father’s name (e.g. “Danel Bar Uthman” is “Danel, son of Uthman”). Since Opeleneans became part of the Auran Empire, however, some families have begun to take Auran names, or to Auranize their given names and patronymics (e.g. “Danel Bar Uthman” might become “Danelus Baruthmanian”).

**Male Names:** Abedsh, Bodash, Danel, Eshmunazar, Hiram, Juba, Maharbal, Paebel, Shillek, Uthman

**Female Names:** Ashera, Elissa, Donatiya, Fahima, Hurriya, Padriya, Rasha, Sapphira, Talliya, Zahira

###### Rornish

Once as barbaric as the Jutlanders, the Rornish people were gradually subjugated and civilized, first by the Celdorean Thalassocracy and later by the Auran Empire. When Rorn was part of the Empire, Rornish folk could be found throughout its provinces as craftsmen, soldiers, and servants. Some Rornish pockets still linger in eastern and southern lands, but today the Rornish are mostly found in the newly-independent kingdom, fighting in their ongoing war against the Jutlandic invaders to the west.

Rornish people are tall-statured (men averaging 5’10”) and athletically built, with broad shoulders and narrow waists. They have oval- or triangle-shaped faces with broad foreheads, narrow jaws, and moderately thin lips. Rornish eyes are round and deep-set, with coloration of blue, blue-grey, green-grey, green, hazel, or light brown. Their skin color ranges from fair and freckled to light brown. Rornish hair is straight or wavy, and colored golden blonde, strawberry, red, golden brown, rufous brown, auburn, or dark auburn. Their eyebrows tend to be thin and paler than their scalp hair. The men have moderate beard and body hair.

Rornish folk are typically named in the Ivorean language for a famous hero, ancestor, or relative. Rornish commoners do not carry hereditary family names. Men indicate paternity simply by appending their father’s name after their own (e.g. Owain, son of Stuarry, would be “Owain Stuarry”) while women indicate maternity by appending their mother’s name in a like fashion. However, Rornish nobles do carry hereditary family names; these are indicated by the identifier Ty followed by the name of their noble house (e.g. Urien, of House Caradoc, would be “Urien Ty Caradoc”). Because Rorn was a province of the Auran Empire for centuries, many Rornish people carry Auran or Auranized names (e.g. “Urienus Caradocian”), especially in the cities and coastal settlements where the Auran influence was most strongly felt.

**Male Names:** Aeron, Braig, Caradoc, Georn, Mard, Owain, Roben, Stuarry, Theon, Urien

**Female Names:** Anwen, Ceridwen, Deiresa, Eirwen, Katrist, Maranie, Nimue, Rachess, Seren, Vale

###### Shebatean

According to the cartographers, Shebatea is not part of Aurëpos, lying as it does across the Narrow Sea that separates it from Ulruk. And while few Aurëposean ever see the desert realm, Shebatean merchants, sailors, soldiers, and traders are nevertheless common throughout the Ammas Aurë region, famous for their cargoes of incense, spices, and slaves.

Shebateans are medium-statured (men averaging 5’8”) with slender to athletic body builds characterized by broad shoulders, narrow hips, and long legs. They have oval- or ellipse-shaped faces with large, full lips, slightly turned out. Somirean eyes are large, almond-shaped, and of dark brown or black color. Their skin ranges from dark olive to coffee-colored. Shebatean hair is either wavy or curly with wide, open ringlets, and colored dark brown or black. The men have scant to moderate body hair and slight beard hair, usually restricted to moustache and chin.

Shebateans are almost always given names in Old Shebatean, typically for desired personal traits or prominent heroes, clerics, and kings. Shebateans do not use family names, instead indicating lineage with the patronymic Ibn (“son of”) or Bint (“daughter of”) followed by their father’s name (e.g. Suad, son of Rahim, would be “Suad Ibn Rahim”). An aristocratic Shebatean will extend his name as far back as his ancestral records will allow (e.g. “Suad ibn Rahim ibn Wazir ibn Mahmud ibn Rahim”). Some prominent Shebateans will adopt an honorific preceded by Al- (“the”) announcing their deeds or virtue.

**Male Names**: Abaddon, Baruch, Farouk, Hameed, Jafar, Mahmud, Omar, Rahim, Suad, Wazir

**Female Names:** Aliyah, Bathsheba, Fatima, Jamila, Kelaya, Magdala, Nahara, Sapphira, Talia, Zerika

###### Skysos

Hailing from the great steppe-land that extends westward from Aurëpos into Ithea, these dangerous but disorganized nomads have fought, raided, and plundered the lands of Celdorea, Somirea, Shebatea, and Kemesh for centuries. Now the Skysos tribes have united under a great kaǧan and seek conquest and tribute. Exiles and refugees from tribes defeated by the kaǧan can be found throughout Aurëpos, often working as adventurers or mercenaries.

The Skysos are short-statured (men averaging 5’5”) with stocky body builds characterized by square-built frames and short, bowed legs. They have round- or oval-shaped faces with broad features, high cheekbones, and small mouths with moderate lips. Their noses are of medium length and width, with low, concave bridges and wide nostrils. Their distinctive eyes are small, slanted, and narrow, with dark brown or black colors common and blue or grey occasionally seen. Their skin color ranges from light to dark ocher. The hair of the Skysos is very straight, colored dark brown, black, or blue-black. They have bushy eyebrows that often merge in the middle. The men have scant body hair and patchy beard hair. Skysos warriors often practice ritual scarification on their cheeks to make themselves look more fearsome.

Skysos folk are usually named in the Old Skysos tongue. Skysos names are short and simple, typically referencing a totemic animal, a desired personality trait, or a tribal hero. The Skysos do not carry hereditary surnames. Chiefs, heroes, and shamans may carry a sobriquet after their given name (e.g. if Tolga has beheaded many enemies, he might be “Tolga Head-taker”).

**Male Names**: Attila, Buǧra, Doǧan, Erkan, Hakan, Mahzun, Ozan, Ruga, Tolga, Uldin

**Female Names:** Ayla, Beyza, Dilara, Esma, Hale, Mӑtine, Saba, Tϋlay, Ulyuna, Zehra

###### Somirean

The proud and populous Somireans must be considered among the great peoples of Aurëpos. Everywhere within the Sunset Kingdoms, Somireans can be found in great numbers. Once they contended with Aura for the dominance of the region; today the two are allied against the menacing hordes of the Skysos. Noble- and priest-caste Somireans are nowadays not uncommon in the Empire’s armies, academies, and temples.

Somireans are medium-statured (men averaging 5’7”) with athletic to stocky body builds characterized by compact bodies and short, sturdy limbs. They have ellipse-shaped faces with upright foreheads, curved features, and full lips. Somirean eyes are almond-shaped and dark brown or black in color. Their skin color ranges from medium ocher and reddish olive in the north to dark ocher and dark olive in the south. Somirean hair is straight or wavy, and colored dark brown, black, or blue-black. The men have moderate beard and body hair.

Somireans are given names in Classical Somirean based on the configuration of the planets at their time of birth. The selection process seems random to those ignorant of these ancient astrological traditions. Noble-caste Somireans also carry hereditary surnames, usually ending in -ja (“descendant of”) or -yata (“heir of”) and derived from the names of the heroes and conquerors of Somirean mythology (e.g. “Artashumara Ramaja” means Artashumara, descendant of Rama”). Lower-caste Somireans do not carry hereditary family names. They will simply append their profession, their village, or their fathers’ name after their given name (e.g. “Kumara Puru” would be “Kumara, son of Puru”).

**Male Names:** Artashumara, Bindusara, Kumara, Mahinda, Narasimha, Puru, Rama, Vardhana, Xandrama, Yashodharman

**Female Names:** Asmali, Devita, Havati, Kavasha, Nitama, Preena, Skandara, Tadukhepa, Vashi, Yavi

###### Thrassian

The scaly Thrassian race was magically bred from a cross of men and giant lizards long ago by unknown arcanists. Though once they ruled much of Aurëpos, some taint in the Thrassian bloodline caused them to slowly degenerate into primitive savagery. Today, only in dusky Kemesh, last surviving satrapy of Zahar, do Thrassians of the old stock still appear in significant numbers in Aurëpos. There are legends that a great Thrassian kingdom still exists in the inland jungles of Ulruk, south of the Waste, but reputable sages dismiss such claims as nonsense.

Thrassians are reptilian humanoids of great stature (males averaging 6’6” tall) with the heads and tails of lizards. A true warrior race, Thrassians have strong hands with sharp claws, reptilian mouths filled with fangs, and skin armored with a tough scaly hide. The scales are typically olive, brown, grey, or black, with cream patches, while their eyes are hazel, yellow, or orange with slitted pupils.

Thrassian slaves are typically given nicknames in whatever language their owner speaks. Freed Thrassians usually abandon this nickname in favor of a new Thrassian name drawn from the ancient myths and history of their people.

**Male Names:** Akalamdug, Dumuzi, Hadanish, Iltasadum, Lugalme, Meduranki, Puzur, Shudurul, Untash, Zimudar

**Female Names:** Asila, Irkalla, Kushla, Madala, Nissa, Shushana, Tibira, Ulsharra

###### Tirenean

The empire-building Tireneans can be found throughout Aurëpos, though their greatest concentration remains in and around the city of Aura. They are tall-statured (men averaging 5’9”) with athletic body builds characterized by broad shoulders and narrow waists. They have long oval-shaped faces with upright foreheads, prominent cheekbones, narrow jaws, and moderately full lips. Tirenean eyes are deep-set and round, with coloration varying between blue-grey, grey, grey-brown, light brown, and dark brown. Their skin color is light but tans to dark brown. Tirenean hair is straight or wavy, and colored dark blonde, ash brown, dark brown, or black. The men have moderate beard and body hair.

Tireneans are proudly traditional about names, and take care to give every child a carefully-chosen Classical Auran name (although as fluency with Classical’s complexities has slipped away, many provincial Tireneans now carry vulgarized or hybridized versions of the old names). Moreover, while elsewhere in Aurëpos only the upper classes have surnames, in Tirenea even commoners possess hereditary family names (e.g. “Syrena Drakon”). During the Auran League era it was often claimed that every Tirenean was descended from nobility, which may account for Tirenea’s name itself - “land of crowns”. Perhaps becausecommoners have two names, nobles often claim a third name or cognomen based on some characteristic or accomplishment (e.g. “Audarius Valerian Tarkaun”).

**Male Names:** Aurëus, Celictor, Destrio, Gundus, Omus, Quellus, Tavus, Valen, Zelicus

**Female Names:** Aurëlyn, Celena, Dalefa, Hyapsë, Istria, Nauriva, Riara, Syrena, Valanna, Zeodarë

**Surnames:** Amadorus, Drakon, Hyatavië, Ionicus, Mennicus, Nuvicerres, Süromus, Tarcalus, Valerian

###### Zaharan

The erstwhile lords of men are today a rare and scattered people. Pure-blooded Zaharans dwell openly only amongst the nobility of Kemesh and the tyrannical city-states that dot the eastern coast of Ulruk. Elsewhere they live as exiles, disguising their ancestry and practicing their ancient customs in secret.

Zaharans are tall-statured (men averaging 5’9”) with slender body builds characterized by narrow shoulders and hips, long limbs, and slim digits. They have very long heads, sometimes lengthened further by ritual cranial elongation. Their long oval- or diamond-shaped faces have slanted ears, prominent cheekbones, narrow jaws, strong chins, and full lips. Their noses are long, high rooted, and straight. Zaharan eyes are large and almond-shaped, and colored amber, green-brown, grey-brown, or dark brown. Their skin color is reddish-brown, copper, or olive sienna. Their hair can be curly, straight, or wavy, either black or blue-black in color. Their eyebrows are thin and dark, while body and beard hair is scant. Albino Zaharans, with white skin and flaxen hair, are not uncommon and viewed with even more fear than usual.

As Zaharans are looked on with revulsion and fear by their former subjects, most adopt a public name from a local dialect for everyday use. The ancient Zaharan language is always used for a Zaharan’s true, secret name, however. Zaharans indicate descent by attaching the patronymic prefix Bet-, meaning “of the house of”, to their father’s name. Zaharans of the ancient families might bear names with generations worth of patronyms (e.g. “Ashurdan Bet-Izdubar Bet-Merodach Bet-Zikarsin” would be “Ashurdan, of the house of Izdubar, of the house of Merodach, of the house of Zikarsin,” thus tracing the line back to the bearer’s great-grand-father), or simply use the most ancient known ancestor. A Zaharan who can claim descent from one of the ancient sorcerer-kings is held in the highest esteem.

**Male Names:** Ashurdan, Didanu, Izdubar, Kadashman, Merodach, Naramsin, Palakinatim, Sarkimuna, Urhammu, Zikarsin

**Female Names:** Atanah, Belit, Ellat, Itani, Kissare, Ninmarki, Omarosa, Shala, Tabni, Zakiti

# Appendix B: Conditions

Conditions alter a creature’s capabilities in a variety of ways and can arise as a result of a spell, a class power, a proficiency, a monster’s attack, or other effect. Most conditions, such as **blinded**, are impairments, but a few, such as **invisible**, can be advantageous. A condition lasts either until it is countered (the **prone** condition is countered by standing up, for example) or for a duration specified by the effect that imposed the condition. If multiple effects impose the same condition on a creature, each instance of the condition has its own duration, but the condition’s effects don’t get worse (unless the imposing effect specifies otherwise). A creature either has a condition or doesn’t. The following definitions specify what happens to a creature while it is subjected to a condition.

### General Rules for Conditions

The following rules apply to all conditions, except where otherwise noted:

* A condition that prevents a creature from casting spells also prevents the creature from using spell-like abilities that require one full round or more, and from using scrolls.
* A condition that prevents a creature from moving also prevents the creature from taking actions in lieu of moving, such as standing up from being knocked down, sheathing one weapon and drawing another, readying or loosing a shield, picking an item off the ground, or retrieving an item from a pack or sack.
* A condition that prevents a creature from attacking also prevents the creature from taking actions in lieu of attacking that could not be taken as actions in lieu of moving, such as drinking a magic potion, lighting a torch, using a magic item, or turning undead.

###### Escaping from the Grabbed, Restrained, Webbed, and Wrestled Conditions

The grabbed, restrained, and wrestled conditions can be ended with a successful escape. Escaping is a combat action.

When attempting to escape from being grabbed or wrestled, a creature has to two options. First, it can attempt to slip free with a Paralysis saving throw. Second, it may attempt to break free with a Dungeonbashing proficiency throw. If the creature has Contortionism proficiency, it gains a +4 bonus on either throw. If the creature is grabbed, grappled, or restrained by a large or imposing creature, it suffer a penalty on this throw. In either case, if the throw succeeds, the creature has escaped.

When attempting to escape from being restrained or webbed, a creature may in some cases have the option to slip free or break free, as above. Sometimes the creature may also or instead have the option to cut free by, e.g., slashing off the tentacle which is restraining it or to burn away the webbing. To cut itself free, a creature must successfully deal a particular amount of damage (noted in the monster’s description) to the creature or appendage that has restrained it.

### List of Conditions

###### Beholding

* A creature is beholding another creature or effect when that creature or effect is in line of sight and within 10% of maximum visibility distance. (In normal conditions, the maximum visibility distance to a man-sized creature is 600’, so it can be beheld at 60’.)
* A creature can behold creatures using lightless vision, but not using echolocation, mechanoreception, or shadowy senses.
* At the start of its initiative, a creature can close its eyes to avoid beholding a creature or effect or open its eyes if currently doing so. A creature that is closing its eyes is considered **blinded** until it stops closing its eyes.

###### Concentrating and Stationary

* A concentrating and stationary creature is able to sustain a continuous spell or effect which requires stationary concentration.

* Only living creatures can be affected by this condition.

###### Enervated

* An enervated creature must make a Death saving throw each day when it wakes from 8 hours of restful sleep. If the creature rests in a pinnacle of good (see ***ACKS JJ****,* p. XX), it gains a bonus to its save: +1 for an illuminated pinnacle, +2 for a hallowed pinnacle, and +4 for a sacrosanct pinnacle. If the creature does not gain 8 hours of restful sleep in a day, it automatically fails the save. If the save fails, the creature permanently reduces its maximum hit points by another point. If the save succeeds, the creature does not reduce its maximum hit points further that day. If the save succeeds three times in a row, the condition ends. A creature unlucky enough to be reduced to 0 maximum hit points by this condition is slain.
* A creature can end the condition and restore its maximum hit point total by being healed with ritual magic. A creature that advances in level can re-roll its maximum hit points using its full hit dice, but leveling itself does not end the enervated condition.

###### Engaged

* A restrained creature cannot move, but can still attack, cast spells, take actions in lieu of attacking or moving, or attempt to escape.
* The opponent which restrained the creature can automatically deal damage on its initiative each round to the restrained creature without having to make an attack throw. Doing so counts as the opponent’s attack with whatever special natural weapon it used to restrain the creature. The restrained creature still receives a saving throw against any special effects of the attack (such as poison, etc.).
* A restrained creature also has the **vulnerable** condition while it is restrained.

Some creatures may have the speed at which they can move restrained opponents listed; if not otherwise noted, a restrained creature can be moved at the same rate as the opponent’s combat speed, subject to encumbrance. The restrained creature’s weight (lbs / 10) is applied as stones of encumbrance to the opponent’s appendage(s). Calculate the normal load for the opponent’s appendage(s) as (creature’s normal load x number of appendages restraining creature / total number of appendages) for purposes of calculating the rate at which the restrained creature can be moved.
* The restrained condition is ended immediately when the restrained creature escapes or when the creature which restrained it releases it. If restrained by multiple causes, each must be escaped separately.

* *Treatment Timing:* +2 if treated within 1 round of injury; -3 if treated within 1 turn of injury; -5 if treated within 1 hour of injury; -8 if treated within 1 day of injury; -10 if treated more than 1 day after injury

When a permanently wounded or dead creature is healed with *repair disfigurement and disability* or *restore life and limb*, the creature rolls 1d20 and 1d6 on the **Tampering with Mortality** table for his alignment and applies the modifiers listed below. The resulting side effects are permanent and can only be removed with a *miracle* or *wish*.

* *Span of Creature’s Life:* +2 if creature is youthful; 0 if creature is adult; -5 if creature is middle aged; -10 if creature is old; -20 if creature is ancient
* *Spellcaster’s Power:* +½ level of spellcaster casting spell; +2 if cast in temple of spellcaster’s god
* *State of the Creature’s Body:* -10 if creature instantly killed; -5 per spine severing; -2 per limb destroyed; -1 per each hand/foot/ear/eye/tongue/genitalia destroyed; +5 if creature still alive
* *State of the Creature’s Soul:* ±WIL modifier of creature; -1 for each full day since death; -1 for each side effect already suffered

A creature is considered to be instantly killed if it died from disease or poison, was slain while helpless, or rolled an “instantly killed” result on the Mortal Wounds table. The maximum penalty for state of the creature’s body is -10.

### Scarring

The most common permanent wound is scarring. Scarring can be minor, notable, or gruesome. Minor scarring has no game effect, but if a character suffers minor scarring three times, he becomes notably scarred. Being notably scarred imposes a -2 to throws to impersonate another character. If a character suffers notable scarring three times, he becomes gruesomely scarred. Gruesome scarring grants a +1 bonus to intimidate others, but makes it impossible to impersonate another character and imposes a -2 penalty to all other reaction rolls.

### Other Permanent Wounds and Side Effects

Permanent wounds and side effects, can reduce attributes, reduce movement rate, impose penalties to certain throws or rolls, impose conditions (such as **blinded**, **mute**, or **paralyzed**), limit the character’s ability to undertake certain activities (such as using the two-handed weapon fighting style or force marching), or even cause death over time. The effects of all permanent wounds and side effects are cumulative. There are no mundane ways to cure permanent wounds or side effects, but some effects can be temporarily suppressed with healing herbs.

When a creature loses a body part, the Judge will determine whether the left or right part is lost based on the circumstances. For instance, if a creature, equipped with a sword in its right hand and shield in its left, is attacked from its right flank and has its hand chopped off, the Judge would rule that it lost its right hand. If the circumstances do not suggest one or the other side to be more likely, the Judge will roll 1d6; 1 – 3 it’s the right side, 4 – 6 it’s the left side.
