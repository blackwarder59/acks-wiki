### Dakhanavar, Lesser

Dakhanavars are often confused with vampires, but the creatures are distinct. The mother of
monsters, Iskara, bred the dakhanavar by infusing cacodemon ichor into the bodies of giant
blood-drinking bats. Lesser dakhanavars were formed with the ichor of less powerful cacodemons than
their greater kin. They resemble bats of great size with wingspans of 40’ and weights of 350 lbs.
They have huge fanged mouths and great fingered wings barbed at each joint’s end with iron claws.

Dakhanavars are as intelligent as mortal men. They can speak Ancient Zaharan, Classical Auran,
Common, Elvish, and the dialect of any local beastmen. They dwell in forbidding ruins, dark forests,
and bleak cliffs.

###### Combat

If a lesser dakhanavar damages a target with its bite, the dakhanavar latches onto it and begins
**draining blood**.Once latched on, the dakhanavar can use its combat action to automatically deal
2d6 {N!} damage to the creature each round. Creatures that are having their blood drained by a
dakhanavar can still move, but count as carrying an extra 50 st. of encumbrance equal to its weight.
The dakhanavar moves with the creature from which it is drinking blood.

###### Ecology

When lesser dakhanavar are encountered in their roost, there is a 35% chance the dakhanavar will be
accompanied by 2d10 giant vampire bats and 4d10 bat swarms.

Dakhanavar are interfertile with other dakhanavar as well as with giant vampire bats. If both
parents are greater dakhanavar, the offspring will be too. If one parent is greater and one parent
is lesser, the offspring will be a lesser dakhanavar. In all other cases, the offspring will be a
giant vampire bat. Dakhanavar of the male sex tend to copulate freely with any available partner,
but those of the female sex will only mate with another dakhanavar of equal or greater status, never
with bats. Offspring are carried by the mother until they reach juvenile age and become capable of
flying.

Whenever dakhanavar are encountered, each dakhanavar has a 15% chance of carrying a recently-born
pup. Lesser dakhanavar pups have 3 AC, 15’ Spd, and 2 HD, while greater dakhanavar pups have 4 AC,
15’ Spd, and 2+3 HD. Neither can fly and both can attack with two scritches (1 slashing damage) and
a nibble (1 piercing damage).

###### Spoils

A slain lesser dakhanavar can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks)
for the following components useful in magic research:

* ears (3 st, 180gp, *inaudibility, noiselessness*)
* fangs (3 st, 180gp, *bloody flux, life transfer*)
* wings (3 3/6 st, 210gp, *flight, winged flight*)
