### Attercop, Demonic

The mother of monsters, called Iskara by the Aurans, created the demonic attercops by infusing
cacodemon ichor into the bodies of giant spiders. These hell-spawned arachnids measure 12’ long with
legs tipped with iron-hard claws that stretch to 9’ and bodies weighing a titanic 2,300 lbs. They
dwell in the fetid swamps, dark forests, and high mountains of the wild.

Demonic attercops are nowadays very rare, but they have spawned many children: All of the various
lesser attercops are descended, by way of repeated mating with giant spiders, from the demonic
attercop.

Attercops are sapient and speak their own horrific language. Scholars who have studied Ancient
Zaharan, Khepri, and Thrassian find certain similarities in the attercop tongue.

###### Combat

Demonic attercops are ambush predators, and creatures encountering attercops suffer a -2 penalty to
surprise rolls due to the spiders’ **natural stealth**.

A demonic attercop **is dreadful** to confront.A creature which starts its initiative, or moves
within, 60’ of a demonic attercop must make a Paralysis saving throw. If the save succeeds, the
creature gains immunity to the effects of every attercop’s dreadfulness for 1 turn. If the save
fails, the creature starts **faltering.** If the creature was already faltering, it becomes
**frightened** instead. The faltering or frightened condition ends if removed magically or if the
demonic attercop is destroyed or no longer within 60’.

To aid in ambush, demonic attercops spin webs in strategic locations around their lairs. They use
these webs to entangle victims in their webs in order to capture them and keep them fresh for later
consumption. They can also spin a web around a target as a melee attack. If a creature moves into an
attercop’s web, or if an attercop succeeds on a webspinning attack throw against a creature, that
creature becomes **webbed.**

A demonic attercop’s **webbed mechanoreception** enables it to “see” any creatures touching their
webs.

A demonic attercop can attack by spinning a web (above), biting, or goring with its great horns. If
it bites its target, it deals 4d10 {P!} damage and injects a **deadly** **venom**. A creature
damaged by an attercop’s bite must make a Death saving throw at -4. If the save succeeds, the
creature is not affected by the venom. If the save fails, then creature suffers 10d6 {Po!} damage
and becomes **paralyzed** for 2d4 turns at the end of the attercop’s initiative. The paralysis can
be cured by *neutralize poison* but not *cure light injury.* When the paralysis wears off, the
poisoned creature is **fatigued**. The fatigue ends if the poison is neutralized or after the
creature enjoys 8 hours of restful sleep.

If it gores its target, it deals 2d10 {P!} damage per horn. If at least one horn hits, the target
must make a successful size-adjusted Paralysis save or be knocked prone.

If both horns hit, the target is automatically knocked **prone**. If the target is knocked prone,
the demonic attercop can then either make a bite attack or make 4 attacks with its clawed legs, each
dealing 2d10 {S!} damage on a successful hit.

Demonic attercops have many-layered hides that make them **immune** to mundane physical damage.
When damaged, demonic attercops **brood in darkness**,regenerating 3 hp per round provided that they
remain stationary and are not exposed to any light. They can even regenerate lost limbs or eyes,
given sufficient time.

###### Ecology

Demonic attercops can reproduce with other attercops as well as with the various species of giant
spider. When encountered in a wilderness lair, there is a 5% chance the demonic attercop is watching
over a clutch of eggs. The nature and number of these eggs will depend on the species with which the
she copulated. Roll 1d10 to find out: 1, another attercop; 2-4, a giant tarantula; 5-7, a giant
black widow; 8-10, a giant crab spider.

If the mother bred with any other attercop, she’ll have lain 1 demonic attercop egg. If the mother
bred with a giant tarantula, she’ll have lain 1d4 monstrous attercop eggs; if with a giant black
widow, 4d6 hideous attercop eggs; and if with a giant crab spider, 6d6 foul attercop eggs. Demonic
attercop eggs have 1 hp and weigh 4 st each. (See the other attercop entries for the smaller eggs.)

Normally the spiderlings disperse upon hatching, but the demonic influence of the attercop
sometimes causes them to lair nearby, creating a fell region infested with arachnids.

###### spoils

A slain demonic attercop can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks)
for the following components useful in magic research:

* carapace (15 st, 900gp, *physical invulnerability (all), tenebrosity*)
* horns (15st, 900gp, *cone of fear, inspire horror, panic*)
* mandibles (11 st, 650gp, *poison*)
* leg tarsus (10 st, 600gp, *spider climb*)
* spinneret (10 st, 600gp, *chameleon, webbing*)

If not used for magic research, a demonic attercop’s mandibles fetch 40gp and weigh 4/6 st. Its
venom (onset time 1 round, no saving modifier, paralysis for 1d4 turns and 5d6 {Po} damage on failed
Death saving throw) fetches 1,000gp and weighs 1/6 st.

###### Encounter

A Zaharan temple portico has been carved into the face of a rocky cliff at an elevation of some
100’. An entryway, visible as a black silhouette from ground level, suggests there is a rock-cut
interior within. A narrow rubble-strewn trail (which requires a balancing traverse to ascend) slowly
winds a 200’ course upward to the portico.

Adventurers who ascend to investigate discover that the temple portico once carried bas-relief
engravings, now difficult to decipher because of age and erosion – all that remains visible is a
cluster of stone spheres, two large and six small, arranged in pairs.

The rock-cut temple inside has a left-right width of 60’ and a length longer than torchlight can
reveal (75’), such that rear of the temple shrouded in darkness.

In the darkness lurks Uttu, one of the last of the demonic attercops created by Iskara before the
Day Without Night. Uttu rests upon a pyramid of bones built from her victims over the years, the
whole bound together with webbing to form a bed for her great bulk. Uttu’s dreadful aura extends out
60’, so any adventurer who moves more than 15’ into the temple must immediately begin to make
Paralysis saves.

**Demonic Attercop:** Spd 60’ / 120’ web, AC 10, HD 10\*\*\*\*, hp 55, #AT 1 (bite or web 1+) or 2
(horns 1+), Dmg 4d20 {P!} + poison, web, or 2d10 {P!}, Save F10, ML +1, AL C, XP 3,650; Special:
dreadful, knockdown, regeneration, immunity

Uttu’s treasure is hidden within the sticky webbed bone pyramid of her fallen victims. Removing the
treasure from the webbing by hand is a pain-staking process that will require 8 man-hours.
Adventurers who burn off the webs can retrieve the treasure in 1 man-hour, but burning the webs
destroys the scrolls in the hoard.

The treasure consists of 4,000ep; 4,000gp; a wrought silver signet ring (500gp); a pair of wrought
bronze bulls (100gp each); a pair of chryselephantine statuettes of Iskara (700gp each); a crown of
wrought orichalcum with thousands of tiny diamonds (4,000gp); a **wand of thunderbolts**(appears as
a short stick with wavering grooves down its length, 12 charges); a **potion of adjust self**(slowly
changes hue each turn); a **potion of vigor** (silver tint, euphoric sensation when tasted); a
bronzewood scroll box containing a **scroll of magic warding**,scroll of demon warding, **scroll of
discern magic**, and scroll of **banner of invincibility and passageway**; a pouch with **dust of
revelation** (14 pinches, no apparent value); a stitched leather quiver with **17 arrows +3**
(fletched of dawn redwood with eagle feathers), a **battle axe +1** (double-bladed dwarven bearing
the sigil of Azen Khador); and, lastly, a set of two backwards-curved elven short swords with
pommels carved in the shape of a great dawn redwood.

The first sword in the set is a **short sword +1, +3 vs. undead**. Its blade is carved with runes
of law and luminous power. The second sword is a **short sword +1, +3 vs. beastmen**; its blade is
carved with runes of smiting and vengeance. A successful Loremastery proficiency throw identifies
these weapons as *Dorn na Marbh* (“doom to the dead”) and *Dorn na Beithíoch* (“doom to the
beastly”), famously wielded by the elven hero Caoimhin ua Orthanach, who disappeared in an
expedition in 184 IY.
