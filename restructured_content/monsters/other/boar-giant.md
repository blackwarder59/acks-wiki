### Boar, Giant

These giant cousins of ordinary boars are 7’ to 10’ long and weigh about 930 lbs. They are much
more aggressive, cunning, and predatory than the ordinary breeds. Orcs (which were bred from boars)
have a special affinity for them, and often use giant boards as mounts in battle.

Giant boars are much smarter than ordinary boars. However, they are much slower to grow and eat
much more food than ordinary boars, so giant piglets are actually worth less than common as piglets.

Whether in the wild or with orcs, giant boars crave the meat of humanoids, and will attack them
with little to no provocation. Humanoids other than orcs that encounter giant boars suffer a -2
penalty to their reaction rolls.

###### Combat

Like ordinary boars, giant boars have **acute hearing** and **acute olfaction.** They gain a +2
bonus to avoid surprise in their natural habitat. They can track the scent of creatures for up to 4
miles with the equivalent of two ranks of Tracking proficiency.

In combat, giant boars gore their targets with their mighty tusks for 3d4 {P} damage.

###### Ecology

When giant boars are encountered in their den, the giant boars will be rearing 2d4 juvenile boars
and 1d4 baby boars. Juvenile giant boars have AC 1, Spd 90’, HD 2+2, and attack with stubby tusks
(1d6 {P}). Baby giant boars have AC 0, Spd 90’, HD 1+1, and attack with head butts (1d2 {B}).

###### Spoils

A slain giant boar can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the
following component:

* tusks (3 2/6 st, 200gp, *curse of swine, righteous wrath,* armor +1)

If not used for magic research, a giant boar’s two tusks fetch 2gp and weigh 1/6 st each. Its pelt
fetches 80gp and weighs 2 3/6 st.

###### Encounter

A shrub thicket has become the shelter of a family of **two giant boar**, **four juvenile boars**,
and **two baby boars**. The boars have dragged broken branches and grasses to form a ground cover,
and dug down to cover themselves with soil and pine needles. The tough old boar who leads the family
has a leather collar around his neck, moldy and rotten. The boar and the oldest sow have both been
branded with an orcish sigil, “Urtyarg.”
