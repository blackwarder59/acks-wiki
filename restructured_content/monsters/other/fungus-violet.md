### Fungus, Violet

Violet fungi are large animate mushrooms that can vary in color from an overall purple hue to a
dull gray or violet covered with purple spots. They closely resemble shriekers, with which they
often grow in symbiotic patches: When the shriekers’ hellish racket attracts a curious creature, the
violet fungus tries to kill it. Both fungi enjoy the fruits of a successful hunt, as the decomposing
matter of the slain creature feed growth.

Unlike the sessile shriekers, however, violet fungi are mobile. A violet fungus can slowly move
across the ground by expanding and contracting its stipe, undulating somewhat like an upright
caterpillar. Violet fungi are found in dank caves, damp dungeons, and other dark, wet locations
underground. They are virtually never seen on the surface.

###### Combat

Violet fungi “see” by means of **terrestrial mechanoreception**,enabling the fungus to sense
vibration in the ground over long distances equivalent to line of sight in full daylight. Spells or
effects that would ordinarily cause blindness do not affect the fungus. However, creatures that are
flying, levitating, or otherwise not touching the ground are invisible to it. Terrestrial
mechanoreception can penetrate structures and terrain features.

A violet fungus has four tentacles that secrete a lethal toxin carried in black oily spores. Any
creature damaged by a tentacle must make a Death saving throw. If the save succeeds, there is no
effect. If the save fails, the creature becomes **queasy** immediately and will die in 2d6 turns.

Violet fungi are **immune** to enchantment effects and to poisonous damage (except from poisons
specifically designed to work on fungi).

###### Ecology

Violent fungi reproduce biannually by dispersing tiny spores that are invisible to the naked eye.
These spores are then carried by underground air currents throughout the subterranean environment.

The fungi themselves also tend to meander through the underdark, at least until they find a patch
of shrieking fungi to nestle within. Anytime a patch of violet fungi is encountered, the violet
fungi will always be accompanied by a patch of 1d8 shriekers.

###### Spoils

A destroyed violet fungus can be harvested with Alchemy for the following components useful in
magic research:

* oil spore (1 1/6 st., 70gp, *neutralize poison*, *poison*)
* tentacle (1 st., 665p, *forest enchantment, plant growth*)

Violet fungi poison can be extracted (250gp, onset time 3d6 turns, +2 saving modifier, target
suffers 3d6 {Po} damage on failed Death saving throw).
