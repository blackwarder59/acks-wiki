### Attercop, Hideous

Hideous attercops are the distant descendants of the demonic attercops, the demonic ichor having
somewhat thinned over the course of multiple generations of breeding with giant spiders of the
mortal sort. A hideous attercop is about 6’ long and corpulent with chitin and venom, weighing 240
lbs. Like their progenitors, these arachnid horrors dwell in the fetid swamps, dark forests, and
high mountains of the wild.

Attercops are sapient and speak their own horrific language. Scholars who have studied Ancient
Zaharan, Khepri, and Thrassian find certain similarities in the attercop tongue.

###### Combat

Hideous attercops are ambush predators, and creatures encountering attercops suffer a -2 penalty to
surprise rolls due to the spiders’ **natural stealth**.

Their bites carry a dangerous **paralytic venom.** A creature damaged by a hideous attercop’s bite
must make a Death saving throw. If the save succeeds, the creature is not affected by the venom. If
the save fails, then creature suffers 3d6 {Po} and becomes **paralyzed** for 2d4 turns at the end of
the attercop’s initiative. The paralysis can be cured by *neutralize poison* but not *cure light
injury.* When the paralysis wears off, the poisoned creature is **fatigued**. The fatigue ends if
the poison is neutralized or after the creature enjoys 8 hours of restful sleep.

To aid in ambush, hideous attercops spin webs in strategic locations around their lairs. They use
these webs to entangle victims in their webs in order to capture them and keep them fresh for later
consumption. They can also spin a web around a target as a melee attack. If a creature moves into an
attercop’s web, or if an attercop succeeds on a webspinning attack throw against a creature, that
creature becomes **webbed.**

The attercop’s **webbed mechanoreception** enables them to “see” any creatures touching their webs.

###### Ecology

Hideous attercops can reproduce with any other attercops; the mother determines the resultant
offspring. When encountered in a den, there is a 10% chance per hideous attercop that it will be
guarding a clutch of 2d4 eggs. Hideous attercop eggs have 1 hp and weigh 1/6 st.

###### Spoils

A slain hideous attercop can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks)
for the following components useful in magic research:

* mandibles (2/6 st, 20gp, *poison*)
* leg tarsus (2/6 st, 20gp, *spider climb*)
* spinneret (4/6 st, 40gp, *chameleon, webbing*)

If not used for magic research, a hideous attercop’s mandibles fetch 12gp and weigh 1/6 st. Its
venom (onset time of 1 turn, +4 saving modifier, paralysis for 1d4 turns and 1d8 {Po} damage on
failed Death saving throw) fetches 250gp and weighs 1/6 st.
