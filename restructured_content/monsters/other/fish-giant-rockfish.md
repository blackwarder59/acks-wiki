### Fish, Giant Rockfish

These giant fish grow to a length of about 20’ and weight of 6,800 lbs. They can be found anywhere
from shallow coastal waters to abyssal depths, but they especially favor rocky outcrops, reefs, and
kelp forests in cold water.

###### Combat

Giant rockfish’s scaley bodies closely resemble the rocky sea surface that they call home, and
characters encountering the rockfish suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls due to this **natural
stealth.**

Giant rockfish rely on a lateral line system that affords them **aquatic mechanoreception**. They
can “see” in water up to 300’ by sensing changes in water current and water pressure. Spells or
effects that would ordinarily cause blindness do not affect the rockfish while it is using aquatic
mechanoreception. However, creatures that are not in the water are invisible to them. Aquatic
mechanoreception does not penetrate structures or terrain features.

The giant rockfish’s spines carry a **deadly venom**. Any creature damaged by a spine must make a
Death saving throw. If the save succeeds, the creature is not affected by the venom. If the save
fails, the creature dies at the end of the rockfish’s initiative.

If a creature accidentally steps on or stumbles into a hidden rockfish, the creature is
automatically struck by all four spines, each dealing 1d4 x 4 piercing damage and requiring a Death
saving throw.

###### Ecology

Giant rockfish do not establish nests or exhibit any parental care for their offspring. They rely
on pelagic spawning, in which the female releases her eggs into the water column and the male
externally fertilizes them. The eggs are buoyant and simply float until they hatch.

###### Spoils

A slain giant rockfish can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the
following components useful in magic research:

* gills (1 st, 60gp, *water breathing, swimming*)
* poisoned spines (3 2/6 st, 200gp, *neutralize poison, poison*)
* rocky scales (3 2/6 st, 200gp, *chameleon*)

A giant rockfish’s venom (onset time 1 round, +1 saving modifier, target suffers 5d6 {Po} damage on
failed Death saving throw) fetches 450gp and weighs 1/6 st.
