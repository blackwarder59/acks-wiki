### Cat, Cheetah

Cheetahs are spotted chase predators found in the grasslands of Somirea, Kemesh, Opelenea, and
Ulruk. A typical specimen measures about 4’ in length and 100 lbs in weight.

Cheetahs avoid humans and demi-humans when possible.

###### Combat

Cheetahs have **acute vision**, **hearing** and **olfaction.** They gain a +3 bonus to avoid
surprise in their natural habitat. They can track the scent of creatures for up to 6 miles with the
equivalent of three ranks of Tracking proficiency.

Their **lightning reflexes** grant a +1 bonus to initiative. They are **naturally stealthy** when
in their native habitat, and creatures encountering them suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls.

If a cheetah charges a creature and successfully hits it with both claws, it immediately
**pounces** onthe creature. The cat’s subsequent bite attack automatically hits and the creature
that has been pounced on must make a successful size-adjusted Paralysis saving throw or be knocked
**prone**.

Cheetahs are entirely configured for sprinting speed and cannot sustain a fast pace of long
distance travel. Because of their **poor endurance**, their expedition speed is halved relative to
their combat speed.

###### Ecology

When cheetahs are encountered in a wilderness den, there is a 50% chance the cheetahs will be
rearing cheetah cubs. Roll 1d6 for age and number: 1-2 it’s 1d2 juvenile cheetahs, 3-6 it’s 1d4 baby
cheetahs. Juvenile cheetahs have AC 3, Spd 300’, HD 2, and attack with 2 claws (1d2 {S}) and a bite
(1d3 {P}). Baby cheetahs have AC 2, Spd 270’, HD 1+1, and attack with 2 scratches (1 {S}) and a
fierce nibble (1 {P}).

###### Spoils

A slain cheetah with exceptional attributes can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor
(Butchery) or Trapping for the following components useful in magic research:

* heart (3/6 st, 27gp, *swift sword, teleportation*)
* tongue (2/6 st, 20gp, *call of the great cats*)

A cheetah's spotted pelt fetches 50gp and weighs 2/6 st.

Cheetahs are popular pets among the nobility, where they are used for sport hunting and
companionship. They sometimes are used as arena beasts in the Auran Empire, but generally the larger
cats are preferred for such shows.

###### Encounter

A secluded spot marked by a ring of tall, resilient grass and sporadic acacia trees serves as the
sanctuary for a feline family consisting of a **cheetah** and her **four baby cheetah cubs**. The
ground within the ring is dotted with soft patches of dry grass, where the mother has excavated
shallow depressions for the cubs to rest and play.
