### Golem, Bronze

Bronze golems are magical constructs made of bronze with molten copper inside them. Most bronze
golems are fastened to resemble giant bronze-armored warriors from archaic eras. A typical bronze
golem stands 10’ tall and (being solid bronze) weighs almost 5 tons. Creating one involves the
employment of mighty magic by exceptionally powerful spellcasters.

Like most constructs, bronze golems have no true intelligence. The magic that animates them imbues
them with just enough sapience to follow simple or standing orders from their creators.

###### Combat

When encountered, a bronze golem’s reactions are always determined by its creator’s orders (even if
given long, long ago).

In combat, bronze golems smash foes with a powerful punch or huge weapon. If armed with a huge
piercing or slashing weapon, a bronze golem delivers a **vicious blow** that deal an additional 4
points per smash. If armed with a huge bludgeoning weapon, a bronze golem can **topple and fling**
man-sized or smaller creatures with every attack (p. XX). The creature struck must make a successful
size-adjusted Paralysis saving throw or be knocked **prone** and forced back a number of feet equal
to the damage dealt. The bronze golem can cleave after a successful smash that forces back its
target.

Bronze golems are **immune** to enchantment effects; fire, necrotic, and poisonous damage; and all
types of mundane damage. As constructs, they count as enchanted creatures for purposes of spells
such as *dispel evil*and *holy circle*.

If a bronze golem suffers piercing or slashing damage in melee, the creature that dealt the damage
must make a Blast saving throw. If the save succeeds, there is no effect. If the save fails, the
creature suffers 2d6 {F!} damage as some of the **molten copper** within the golem gushes over it.

###### Ecology

As constructs, bronze golems have no natural habitat. They can be found guarding ancient treasures,
dwarven vaults, or places of power or serving powerful spellcasters.

###### Spoils

A destroyed bronze golem can be harvested with Magical Engineering for the following component:

* bronze head (106 4/6 st, 6400gp, *giant strength, physical protection (all),* any elemental fire
