### Cat, Saber-Tooth Tiger

Saber-tooth tigers are an ancient species that the most learned sages agree to be long extinct in
Aurëpos. However, adventurers have reported encountering these prehistoric predators in the high
mountains of Aurëpos, the untamed jungles of Ulruk and certain uncharted and remote tropical
islands.

###### Combat

Saber-toothed tigers have **acute hearing** and **acute olfaction.** They gain a +2 bonus to avoid
surprise in their natural habitat. They can track the scent of creatures for up to 4 miles with the
equivalent of two ranks of Tracking proficiency.

They are **quite agile** (as Acrobatics proficiency at 12+) and **good climbers**, able to ascend
sheer surfaces as if they were thieves (6+). They are also **adept at swimming** (as Swimming
proficiency). Their **lightning reflexes** grant a +1 bonus to initiative. They are **naturally
stealthy** when in their native habitat, and creatures encountering them suffer a -2 penalty to
surprise rolls.

If a tiger charges a creature or leaps over it (using Acrobatics), and successfully hits it with
both claws, it immediately **pounces** onthe creature. The tiger’s subsequent bite attack
automatically hits and the creature that has been pounced on must make a successful size-adjusted
Paralysis saving throw or be knocked **prone**.

###### Ecology

When saber-tooth tigers are encountered in a wilderness den, the saber-tooths will be rearing 1d2
juvenile saber-tooths and 1d4 baby saber-tooths. Juvenile saber-tooths have AC 1, Spd 120’, HD 4,
and attack with 2 claws (1d3 {S}) and a bite (1d8 {P}). Baby saber-tooths have AC 0, Spd 120’, HD
2+2, and attack with 2 scratches (1 {S}) and a bite (1d3 {P}).

###### Spoils

A slain saber-tooth tiger can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for
the following components useful in magic research:

* heart (9 1/6 st, 550gp, *silent step, swift sword,* weapon +1)
* tongue (9 1/6 st, 550gp, *call of the great cats*)

A saber-tooth tiger's pelt fetches 115gp weighs 2 1/6 st.

###### Encounter

A freshwater stream trickling through a narrow gulch flows into a talus cavern, 8’ high, 7’ wide,
and some 40’ long, created by a rock fall some years ago. Creatures attempting to water at the
stream, or enter the cave, are attacked by a troop of **three sabre-tooth tigers** who are rearing a
**pair of juvenile sabre-tooth cubs**. The **troop leader**, ferocious even by the standards of
prehistoric great cats, is ranging on the highlands above the gulch and will arrive 1d6 rounds after
the den is attacked.

Sabre-tooth troop leader: Str 14, Dex 18; AC 6, Spd 180', HD 8, hp 43, #AT 3 (2 claws 2+/bite 1+),
Dmg 1d8+1 {S} / 1d8+1 {S} / 2d8+2 {P}, Save F4, ML +2, XP 1100; Special: lightning reflexes,
