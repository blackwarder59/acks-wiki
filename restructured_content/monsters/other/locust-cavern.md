### Locust, Cavern

Cavern locusts resemble giant grasshoppers with the color of dull stone, measuring 2’ to 3’ in
length and weighing 15 lbs. They are rarely seen aboveground but they are common in caves and
dungeons. They survive on fungus and mold that grows underground. Cavern locusts are particularly
loathed by the mushroom-farming dwarves, for whom they are perennial plague.

###### Combat

Cavern locusts are exceptionally skittish and prone to panic. When threatening creatures approach,
cavern locusts will begin to issue **alarming shrieks** so loudly that it will attract wandering
monsters. The Judge should roll an encounter throw each round that one or more cave locusts are in
combat. If wandering monsters are indicated, they will arrive in 1d4 rounds.

Although capable of scuttling on land and flying in the air, during combat the easily-panicked
cavern locusts will use their movement action to **haphazardly jump** in random directions. Each
jump will carry a locust 1d6 x 10 feet in a random clock direction (use 1d12, with “12” being the
locust’s current facing). If the locust’s jump carries it into or through a creature’s location, the
cavern locust will make a slam attack against the creature, with a hit dealing 1d4 {B} damage.

After jumping, the locust can either bite with its mandibles or expel a **poisonous brown spittle**
at a target within 15’. When attacking with its spittle, the locust can ignore the target’s AC from
armor, but not AC from DEX, magic items, natural armor, or spells. If struck, the target must
succeed in a Death saving throw or starts **vomiting** from the horrible smell for 1 turn. Until the
spittle is rinsed off, each creature that starts its initiative or moves within 5' of a spit-soaked
creature must make a successful Death save or become **queasy** until the end of its initiative.

Because they have evolved to consume highly toxic molds, cavern locusts are **immune** to all
poisonous damage.

###### Ecology

When a nest of cavern locusts is encountered, the locusts will have 5d10 eggs lain nearby. The eggs
have 1 hp and weight 1/200 st. Locust nymphs are rarely found in nests, because the nymphs
immediately disperse into the wild after they emerge from their eggs.

###### Spoils

A slain cavern locust can be harvested with Animal Husbandry 2 for the following components useful
in magic research

* antenna (1/6 st., 10gp, *bloody flux, cloud of poison, physical protection (poisonous)*)
* salivary gland (2/6 st., 20gp, *leaping, mage missile, thunderclap*)
