### Hoarflesh

The hoarflesh, the frozen dead, are born of those unfortunate souls who perish on the frozen
battlefields of Jutland and Rorn. Some of those who die as the ice creeps into their bones and veins
animate as these frozen undead, perfectly preserved as they were at the moment of death.

As they arise only after battles fought in frigid weather, hoarflesh are rarely seen. According to
Jutlandic legend, however, in centuries past, powerful necromancers north of the Jutting Mountains
assembled vast hordes of hoarflesh and marshalled them into armies of the frozen dead that
terrorized their people. Some sages claim that Jutlanders invaded Dappakosea in flight from these
hordes...

Hoarflesh are marked by their terribly visible wounds, the icy sheen of their pale frozen flesh,
and the cold light in their eyes, and even in cold lands, the air chills at their approach. Silent,
thoughtless, they crave nothing but the heat of the living.

###### Combat

Unless under another’s control, hoarflesh are automatically Hostile to any living creature they
encounter.

Hoarflesh **radiate intense cold**. Any creature that starts its initiative in or moves within a
10’ radius of a hoarflesh automatically suffers 1d4 {C!} damage. The ice-taloned hands of the
hoarflesh inflict 1d10 {C!} {S!} damage.

The frozen dead are **immune** to enchantment effects and to cold, necrotic, and poisonous damage.
Their frozen flesh is **susceptible** to heat, however. They suffer a -2 penalty to saving throws
against fire effects and suffer double damage from fire. They are inherently evil for purposes of
spells such as *discern evil*and *holy circle*. Hoarflesh are rebuked as wights.

A human or demi-human slain by a hoarflesh rises after 24 hours as a hoarflesh itself unless the
corpse is warmed to above freezing for at least 8 hours.

###### Ecology

Hoarflesh are usually encountered roaming the frozen wastes of northern Jutland and Rorn or lying
still on the icy battlefields in which they were “born.”

###### Spoils

A destroyed hoarflesh can be harvested with Healing 2 for the following components useful in magic
research:

* eyes (5/6 st., 50gp, *cone of frost, wall of frost*)
* claws (1/6 st., 10gp, *frostbite*)
* frozen skin (2/6 st., 20gp, *energy invulnerability (cold), protection from temperature*)
