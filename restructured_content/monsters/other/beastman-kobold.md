### Beastman, Kobold

Kobolds are short, cowardly, and sadistic beastmen bred as pets from lizardmen and dogs by the
ancient Zaharans to mock their former masters, the Thrassians. Standing 2’ to 2 ½’ tall and weighing
about 40 lbs, kobold have scaly lizard-like skin ranging from dark rusty brown to a rusty black
color, but an overall conformation that is vaguely dog-like. All have glowing red eyes with
reptilian pupils. They dwell exclusively underground. They wear little more than ragged hides and
scraps of leather armor, favoring red and orange colors.

###### Combat

Kobolds are **weak warriors** and suffer a -1 damage penalty. Note that kobold champions,
sub-chieftains, and chieftains do not suffer this penalty, and chieftains have a damage bonus (see
below).

Unless special troops are present (p. XX), 50% of gangs or warbands encountered will be archers
(round up), 50% will be warriors (round down). Most kobolds warriors are equipped with hide armor,
shield, 3 javelins, and either a spiked club or hand axe. Kobold archers are equipped with leather
armor, short bows, 20 arrows, and either a spiked club or hand axe.

###### Ecology

Each kobold gang will be led by one champion with 3 AC, 1-1 HD, and 4 hp. Each kobold warband will
be led by a sub-chieftain with 4 AC, 1 HD, and 8 hp. A kobold lair or village will be led by a
chieftain with 5 AC, 2 HD, 12 hp, and a +1 damage bonus. As long as the chieftain is alive, the
kobolds will gain a +2 bonus to morale rolls.

Kobold lairs and villages will have drudges and whelps equal to 100% and 100% of the number of
warriors, respectively. Kobold drudges and whelps have Spd 45’, AC 0, 1 hp, ML -4, and do not fight.

When kobolds are encountered in a village, certain additional creatures will be present. The
chieftain will be defended by 5d4 guards (equivalent to champions statistically). There is a 60%
chance a kobold village will be guarded 4d6 tokay gulls or 1d4 giant weasels. There is a 50% chance
for 1d10 enslaved captives per warband. In addition, a kobold village has a 75% chance of a shaman
being present, and a 50% chance of a witch doctor. A shaman is equivalent to a sub-chieftain
statistically, but has Shaman abilities at level 1d6. A witch doctor is equivalent to a champion
statistically, but has Mage abilities at level 1d4.
