### Chimera

The chimera is a magical hybrid of lion, goat, and red dragon. It has a head of each of these
creature types, including the wings of a dragon, the front portion of the body from a lion, and the
rear portion from a goat. A typical chimera measures 15’ long and weighs 4,000 lbs, with wings that
span about 30’ A chimera’s dragon head is sapient and can speak Draconic.

###### Combat

Chimera have **acute olfaction** and gain a +1 bonus to avoid surprise in its natural habitat.

In combat, the chimera can rake foes with its front claws and attack with all three of its heads:
the lion head attacks with a bite, the goat head gores with its horns, and the dragon head can
either bite or use its **fire breath**.

The fire breath forms a cone 60' long and 30' wide at its terminal end. Each creature within the
cone must make a Blast saving throw. If the save fails, the creature suffers 3d6 {F!}damage. If the
save succeeds, the creature suffers half that damage.

The chimera’s dragon head can only breathe fire 3 times per day; it will use either a bite or the
breath weapon 50% of the time, until the breath weapon runs out and it can only bite.

###### Ecology

Chimera usually dwell in the wilderness, favoring hilly terrain far from human settlements. From
time to time, however, some chimera are drawn by an atavistic draconic instinct to take up residence
in volcanic caves or dungeons.

When chimera are encountered in a wilderness den, the adults have a 25% chance to be incubating 1d4
eggs. The eggs have 1 hp and weigh 4 st. Chimera spawn are rarely found in dens, because the spawn
immediately disperse into the wild after they emerge from their eggs.

###### Spoils

A slain chimera can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the
following components useful in magic research:

* dragon wingtips (6 4/6 st, 400gp, *fan of flames, fireball, flight, winged flight*)
* lion claws (5 st, 300gp, *swift strike*)
* lion mane (5 st, 300gp, *dominate humanoid, dominate monster, remove fear, strength of mind*)
* goat horns (5 st, 300gp, *transform other*)

A chimera's two horns each fetch 1d12x10gp and weigh 1 st per 80gp. A chimera's pelt fetches 350gp
and weighs 3 1/6 st.
