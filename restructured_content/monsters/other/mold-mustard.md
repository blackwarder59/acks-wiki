### Mold, Mustard

Mustard mold has an earthy yellowish-brown color dotted with black or grey specks. A typical
specimen is 10’ in diameter and 1,200 lbs in weight, though much larger molds are possible. Unlike
other oozes, it is sessile, its only movement coming from its slow growth.

###### Combat

Mustard mold possesses **terrestrial mechanoreception** enabling it to sense vibration in the
ground over long distances equivalent to line of sight in full daylight.

A non-magical item of fabric, leather, or wood that strikes mustard mold dissolves immediately
(after dealing damage, if any). A magical item dissolves unless it succeeds on a Death Save (use the
wielder or wearer’s target value, adding any magic bonus if applicable). A creature that attacks or
touches mustard mold with its body suffers 1d6 extraordinary acidic damage.

Any time a creature attacks, touches, or moves into or through mustard mold, there is a 50%
probability that the mold **ejects poisonous spores** into a 10’ cube area. Each creature inside the
area must make a Death saving throw. If the save succeeds, there is no effect. If the save fails,
the creature dies of poison after 6 rounds have elapsed.

Mustard mold is **immune** to enchantment effects and to acidic, arcane, cold, electric, luminous,
necrotic, poisonous, and seismic damage. It has no resistance to fire damage or to bludgeoning,
slashing, or piercing damage However, a non-magical wooden weapon that strikes grey goo dissolves
immediately (as above). Direct sunlight renders mustard mold dormant.

###### Ecology

Mustard mold is found in dank caves and dungeons where it serves as a food source for cave locusts.
It feeds on plants, animals, and other organic matter, but does not digest metal or stone.

It reproduces by budding, detaching a newborn mustard mildew (baby) each time it consumes 1,200 lbs
of organic matter.

###### Spoils

A destroyed mustard mold can be harvested with the following component:

* dried spores (4/6 st, 38gp, *bloody flux, cloud of poison, cure disease, delay disease*)
