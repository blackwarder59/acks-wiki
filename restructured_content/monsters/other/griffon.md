### Griffon

Griffons are powerful, majestic creatures crossbred from eagles and lions. Their forebody, front
legs, head, and wings are those of a giant eagle while their hindquarters, hind legs, and tail are
those of a lion. A typical griffon weighs around 825 lbs and measures 8’ long with a wingspan of
25’. Griffons are fierce carnivores with a particular taste for horse flesh.

###### Combat

Like eagles, griffons have **acute vision** and **alertness**, granting them a +2 bonus to avoid
surprise in their natural habitat.

They prefer horseflesh to all other meat, and if a party encountering griffons has one or more
horses, the griffons are automatically Hostile. The griffons will always attack the horses first,
though they can switch targets later to defend themselves.

A flying griffon can make a **dive attack** with its talons. A dive attack inflicts double the
normal damage (2d4/2d4). If the griffon hits a creature smaller than itself with both its talons
while making a dive attack, the creature must make a size-adjusted Paralysis saving throw. If the
save fails, the creature is **grabbed**.

###### Ecology

When griffons are encountered in their aerie, there is a 25% chance each griffon is guarding
offspring. Roll 1d6f or number and age: 1-2, it’s 1d3 eggs, 3-6, it’s 1 juvenile. Juvenile griffons
have AC 1, Spd 90’, HD 3+2, and attack with 2 talons (1d2 {S}) and 1 bite (1d8 {P}). They cannot
fly. Griffon eggs have 1 hp and weigh 3/6 st.

The valuable offspring are not easy to claim, because griffons are intensely protective of their
young. Griffons defending young do not have to make morale rolls; they always fight to the death.

###### Spoils

A slain griffon can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the
following components useful in magic research:

* beak (2 3/6 st, 150gp, *sharpness, striking, sharpness, swift sword*)
* eyes (2 3/6 st, 150gp, *banner of invincibility, dominate humanoid, remove fear*
* wingtips (2 3/6 st, 150gp, *flight, winged flight*)

A griffon’s two talons each fetch 4gp and weigh 1/6 st and its 4d12 flight feathers each fetch
3d6gp and weigh 1/8 st.

Because of their fierce and predatory nature, griffons of any age can only be trained by monster
whispering.
