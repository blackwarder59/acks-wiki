### Man, Commoner

Commoners are the peasants and serfs that make up the majority of the human population of Aurëpos.

###### Combat

Commoners are not warriors. They lack proficiency with any weapons or armor and suffer a -1 penalty
to attack throws (already factored into their listing) and gain no benefit from high attributes. If
forced to fight, they will equip themselves with field axes, hammers, picks, and shovels, or with
rusty or aged weapons, all dealing 1d6-1 damage. However, they must make morale rolls every round of
combat unless their steward is leading them.

###### Ecology

Each commoner work-gang will be led by a yeoman (1st level fighter). Each commoner band will be led
by a reeve (2nd level fighter). A hamlet will be led by led by a steward (3rd level fighter). All of
these leaders will be middle aged, with a -1 penalty to attack throws, armor class, damage,
initiative, and hp per HD, and initiative. The yeomen will be equipped like ordinary commoners. The
reeve and steward will be equipped with hand axe or sword, shield, and chainmail armor.

Commoner homesteads and hamlets will have adult noncombatants (e.g. adolescent, disabled, elderly,
nursing, or pregnant) and juveniles equal to 100% and 300% of the number of commoners respectively.
These have Spd 90’, AC 0, 1 hp, ML -4, and do not fight.

When commoners are encountered in a hamlet, certain additional creatures will be present. There
will be oxen, pigs, cows, and sheep equal to 100%, 100%, 300%, and 3200% of the number of commoners.
In addition, the hamlet will have a catechist (1st level crusader) to minister to the people’s
spiritual needs. (At the Judge’s discretion, priestesses or shamans can replace crusaders.)

Commoners encountered in hills or mountains have a 50% and 75% chance respectively to be
**shepherds** instead of farmers. Each work-gang of shepherds will be accompanied by 2d6x100 goats
or sheep or (in deserts) 6d10 camels. There will not be oxen, pigs, or cows in the hamlet or manor.
For every 50 goats/sheep, there will be 1 hunting dog.

Commoners encountered on the coast or at sea will be **fishermen** instead of farmers. Each
work-gang of fishermen will crew 1d3 sail boats. If encountered within one hour of dawn or dusk, the
fishermen will be traveling to or from a rich fishing ground. At any other time, they will be
fishing. Each sail boat will have up to 4d10 x 10 st. of fish per fisherman.

###### Spoils

A slain commoner can be harvested with Healing 1 for the following component useful in magic
research:

* heart (1/6 st, 5gp, *beguile humanoid*)

Commoners do not have magic items by treasure type. Instead, commoner leaders should be assigned
magic items using the ***ACKS II JJ***rules (p. XX), whether they are in lair or not.

###### Notes

This commoner hamlet in this monster listing is equivalent to 50 peasant families, with 50
commoners, 50 noncombatant commoners, and 150 juveniles, for a total of 250 humans. It is based on
the economic assumptions explained in ***ACKS II JJ***.
