### Varmint, Giant Shrew

Giant shrews are insectivorous rodents that in some ways resemble giant rats with slightly longer
snouts. They measure around 6’ long and weigh about 215 bs. They are skilled burrowers who often
delve deeply into the soil.

###### Combat

Shrews are nearly blind but able to use **echolocation** (60’ range) by emitting small squeaks. No
spells or effects that would ordinarily blind a creature will affect a shrew, but *inaudible*
creatures are hidden from them, and *noiselessness* blinds them.

Giant shrews are highly territorial and automatically hostile to any creature which enters their
territory. They have **lightning reflexes** and gain a +2 bonus on initiative. Giant shrews can
attack with their bite twice each round.

###### Ecology

When giant shrews are encountered in in a wilderness nest, the shrews will be rearing 1d2 juvenile
shrews and 1d2 baby shrews. Juveniles have AC 3, Spd 150’, HD ½, and attack with 2 bites (1d2 {P}).
Babies have AC 2, Spd 150’, 1 hp, ML -4, and do not fight.

###### Spoils

A giant shrew corpse can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the
following component useful in magic research:

* paws (1/6 st., 10gp, *inaudibility, noiselessness, leaping, swift sword*)

A giant shrew's pelt fetches 8gp and weighs 4/6 st.

Being both blind and territorially hostile, giant shrews are rarely trained except by gnomes, with
whom they share great affinity.

###### Encounter

Erupting from the forest floor is a giant bee hive, 16’ in diameter and 19’ tall, its honeycombed
structure filled with numerous cells, each 2-8’ in diameter. The hive is ominously quiet, and no
insect activity is apparent. In fact, the bees have been devoured by **five giant shrews** who have
now taken up residence here. The shrews are rearing **one juvenile shrew** and **two baby shrews**.
