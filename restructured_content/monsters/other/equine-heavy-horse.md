### Equine, Heavy Horse

Heavy horses are the largest of all equines, bred to be big, strong laborers. Most breeds of heavy
horses are too placid to be trained for war, so heavy warhorses are very expensive. If trained for
war, they function as noted above. Heavy horses are not usually found in the wild except through
happenstance.

###### Combat

Most heavy horses are easily frightened (-2 Morale). Some heavy horses, however, can overcome their
skittishness through **training for war**. War-trained heavy horses gain +2 to morale and (if a
horse) one extra hoof attack. The rider of a war-trained heavy horse can attack with a charge,
dealing double damage with a lance, and a war-trained equine can attack with its hooves during the
charge as well.

###### Ecology

When a heavy horse herd is encountered, there is a 50% chance they will be a matriarchal herd with
1d6 juvenile horses and 1d2 baby horses. (Otherwise, it’s a bachelor herd.) Juveniles have AC 0, Spd
120’, HD 1+3, and attack with 1 hoof (1d3 {B}). Babies have AC -1, Spd 120’, HD 1+1, and attack with
1 hoof (1 {B}).

Heavy horses are bred for strength, speed, and stamina, and finely-bred specimens often have
exceptional attributes (see “Attributes for Monsters,” on p. XXX). Heavy horses with DEX 13+ have
their encounter speed adjusted by 12.5’ x DEX bonus. Their combat speed is adjusted by one-third the
encounter speed adjustment. Their ability to travel long distances quickly is limited by their
stamina as well as speed, so heavy horses have their expedition speed adjusted by the lower of DEX
or CON bonus x 2.5 miles. Equines with STR 13+ have their maximum load adjusted by their STR bonus x
4 st.

###### Spoils

A slain horse with exceptional attributes can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery)
or Trapping for the following component:

* hooves (1 st., 65gp, *call of the galloping herd, safe travels, vigor*)

###### Lore

*While the light sandy soils of the Southern Ammasaurëan are easily worked with a scratch plough
pulled by a donkey, the thick clay-rich soils of Dappakosea and Ivorea require a much heavier plough
pulled by a much stronger workbeast.*

*To meet this need, the northern peoples bred a fine equine commonly called the Dappakosean draft
horse, Juttish horse, and Northern workhorse. Famed for its size, strength, and sweet temperament,
the breed is larger than any other found in Aurëpos. Powerful as a bear but as gentle as a fawn, its
shaggy coat can be bay, black, blood bay, blue roan, chestnut, gray, or red roan.*
