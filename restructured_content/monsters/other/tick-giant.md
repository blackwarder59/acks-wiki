### Tick, Giant

The giant tick is a monstrous man-sized blood-sucking arachnid about that weighs 125 to 380 lbs.
Like giant spiders, giant ticks were created by Nasga to spread suffering throughout the world. They
are found throughout the forests and swamps of Aurëpos, where they lurk motionless until their keen
senses of smell, heat, and moisture detect potential prey nearby.

Unlike their microscopic cousins, which often pursue their entire life cycle parasitically attached
to a single host creature, giant ticks tend to kill their hosts quickly. They then retreat to the
safety of their dens, usually muddy holes or damp tree hollows, until they need to feed again.

###### Combat

Giant ticks have **acute olfaction** that grants them a +1 bonus to avoid surprise in their natural
habitat. They are **naturally stealthy**, and creatures encountering them in their natural habitat
suffer a -1 penalty to surprise rolls.

Giant ticks attack by plunging a harpoon-like hypostome into its target, dealing 1d4 {P} damage. If
a giant tick damages a target with its hypostome, the giant tick latches onto it and begins
**draining blood**.Once latched on, the tick can use its combat action to automatically deal 1d4 {N}
damage to the creature each round. Creatures that are having their blood drained by a giant tick can
still move, but count as carrying extra stone of encumbrance equal to its weight. The tick moves
with the creature from which it is drinking blood. Unless burned, killed, or suffocated by
submersion in water, a giant tick will not let go of a victim until it has dealt necrotic damage
equal to its own maximum hit point total.

Creatures who have had their blood drained by a giant tick have a 50% probability of contracting an
ordinary (but dangerous) disease. The Judge should roll 1d100-10 on the Disease table (***ACKS II
JJ****,* p. XX) to determine the disease and its effects. *Cure disease* is, of course, effective in
eliminating this illness.

###### Ecology

When a wilderness infestation of giant ticks is encountered, there is a 5% chance per tick that it
will have dispersed 2d6+1 eggs nearby. The eggs have 1 hp and weigh 2/6 st. The larvae disperse
after birth and are not found in the den.

###### Spoils

A slain giant tick can be harvested with Animal Husbandry 2 for the following components useful in
magic research:

* hypostome (3/6 st., 29gp, *cause disease, cure disease, cure injury, life transfer*)
