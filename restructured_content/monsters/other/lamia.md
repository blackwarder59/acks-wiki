### Lamia

Lamia are monstrous sorceresses with the torso, arms, and heads of beautiful women, the lower
bodies of beasts, and the tails of serpents. They measure about 8’ long and 7’ tall and weigh about
1,500 lbs.

According to Zaharan myth, the first lamia was a priestess of Nasga who displeased the goddess of
pain and beauty by becoming a mother without her permission. To punish her wayward cultist, Nasga
forced her to devour her own infant, thereafter transforming her into a monstrosity that hungers for
the flesh of the young. Even today, lamia delight in nothing more than devouring children.

As intelligent as human beings, lamia can speak Ancient Zaharan, Common, Elvish, and the dialect of
any local beastmen.

###### Combat

Though a lamia is powerful and dangerous in close combat, it has no stomach for a fair fight,
preferring to use its spell-like abilities to befuddle, bewitch, and deceive its prey. At will, a
lamia can use *perpetual figment*, *spectral figment,* and *word of command*. Once per day, it can
use *bewitch humanoid* and *illusory duplicates*.

If forced to fight, a lamia can attack with a weapon (often a composite bow or spear) or with its
serpentine tail. The tail deals 1d6 {B!} damage and any creature damaged by it is drained of 1 point
of WIL permanently. When a creature reaches WIL 3, it becomes permanently **enslaved** to the lamia.
No magic short of *miracle* or *wish* can restore WIL lost to a lamia’s scaly touch or free a
creature enslaved to it.

###### Ecology

Lamia are often found in ruins or labyrinths, waiting for unsuspecting adventurers. They reproduce
but rarely, in congress with human men they have enslaved into their service. Such children, always
female, are reared far from the lamia, for the creatures would devour their own offspring as readily
as another’s. The young lamia’s true nature does not reveal itself until the child reaches
adolescence and undergoes a horrific metamorphosis.

###### Spoils

A slain lamia can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the
following components useful in magic research:

* fingers (11 4/6 st, 700gp, *enslave humanoid, madness of crowds, weakness of mind*)
* hair (11 4/6 st., 700gp, *illusory duplicates, mirage, perpetual figment*)
* heart (11 4/6 st, 700gp, *bewitch humanoid*)
* tongue (6 4/6 st, 400gp, *discern gist, tongues, word of command*)
