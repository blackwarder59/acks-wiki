### Camel

Camels are one- and two-humped mammals found throughout Opelenea, Kemesh, Shebatea, and the Waste.
They are bred for use as war mounts or pack animals in arid environments.

###### Combat

Camels are **adapted to sand and heat**. Fully-nourished camels never become dehydrated provided
they can drink their fill at least every six months. They ignore movement multipliers from barren or
desert terrain. They can graze their full ration in barren or desert terrain as a dedicated
activity, or as their ancillary activities if they move at half speed.

They also have **rugged endurance** (as Endurance proficiency) and can force march for one day
without penalty, plus one additional day for each point of CON bonus.

A camel can attack with a toothy bite and a kick from its hoof. The bite is more annoying than
dangerous but camel handlers soon learn that a camel’s kicks can be punishing.

Unlike war horses, war camels do not attack with their natural weapons when their rider charges.

###### Ecology

When a caravan of wild camels is encountered, there is a 66% chance the caravan will be accompanied
by 1d2 camel calves. Roll 1d4 for their age: on a 1 they’re baby camels, on 2-4 they’re juvenile
camels. Juvenile camels have AC 0, Spd 120’, 1 HD, and attack with a hoof (1d2 {B!}). Baby camels
have AC 0, Spd 120’, 1 hp, ML -4, and do not fight.

###### Spoils

A slain camel with exceptional attributes can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery)
or Trapping for:

* kidneys (2/6 st, 20gp, *create water, desiccate*)

Slower and surlier than horses, camels are difficult to train and unpleasant to ride. Nevertheless,
they are invaluable mounts in in arid regions.

###### Lore

*For a journey of eight leagues, a man must carry a canteen. For a journey of eighty leagues, a
camel must carry a man.*

* Besheradi proverb

*The cataphracts were little pleased with their new steeds, for the camel is the most accursed of
all beasts -- misshapen and malevolent, spitting and spiteful, vicious and vile! Better to wrestle a
feral ogre than ride a camel.*

* Legate Celic Ionicus, *Annals of the Opelenean War*
