### Giant, Hill

Giants are mighty creatures that compare in stature to humans as humans compare to halflings.
Unlike beastmen, ogres, and trolls, which were bred by the evil alchemy of the Zaharans, giants have
existed since time immemorial, and not all giants are wicked. Some giants are more or less decent,
and have even assisted adventurers from time to time in his various purposes. Most, however, are as
cruel as they are stupid, and delight to eat the flesh of men.

Hill giants stand 15’ tall and weigh about 2,450 lbs. They have skin of rust brown or tan with
ruddy or black hair. They dress in animal skins and typically wield crudely-hewn clubs and spears in
battle.

Giants of all types share a bombastic language. Hill giants also can speak simple words and phrases
in Common.

###### Combat

In combat, hill giants can smash with their fists or with weapons. When smashing with piercing or
slashing weapons, giants deliver **vicious blows** that deal an additional 4 points per smash. When
smashing with bludgeoning weapons, giants can **topple and fling** large or smaller creatures with
every attack (p. XX). The creature struck must make a successful size-adjusted Paralysis saving
throw or be knocked prone and forced back a number of feet equal to the damage dealt. The giant can
cleave if the creature fails its save against his smash.

Instead of smashing, hill giants can **hurl boulders** to a distance of 1200’, dealing 3d6 {B!}
damage in a 5’ radius to the impact point. When hurling a boulder, a giant functions like a heavy
ballista using the rules for Missile Attacks with Artillery (***ACKS II RR****,* p. XX). However,
the giant does not need to reload, so it can throw a boulder each round if it has sufficient ammo.

###### Ecology

Hill giants live in the moors and highlands below the Jutting and Meniri Mountains. Sometimes they
lair in natural caverns, others in huts or steadings of mud, wattle, or wood.

When hill giants are encountered in a dungeon lair or wilderness warband, they have a 25% chance to
be accompanied by trained animals. When encountered in a wilderness lair, they are always
accompanied by trained creatures. If trained creatures are present, roll 1d10 to determine type and
number: 1-5, 4d6 dire wolves; 6-10, 3d6 cave bears.

Adventurers usually encounter small bands of giants who have made their way into civilized realms
to raid and plunder. Rumors and tall-tales speak of colossal steadings high in the mountains filled
with dozens or even hundreds of hill giants with entire clans led by great chiefs. If such a
steading were to exist, it would surely be a challenge for even great heroes.
