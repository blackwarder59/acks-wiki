### Faerie, Redcap

The most vile and vicious of the fae, redcaps are sinewy old men with sharp, elongated teeth,
filthy clawed fingers, and staring red eyes. They wear tarnished mail on their bodies, rusty iron
boots on their feet, and woolen caps on their heads, stained red with the blood of those they kill,
and carry jagged iron spears.

Redcaps live a solitary life, actively hunting such lone or weak-looking wanderers or beasts as
venture too close. When a victim is slain, the redcap dips its cap in the blood before settling down
to feast.

Like other faeries, redcaps are found primarily in northern Aurëpos, particularly in Northern
Argollë, Jutland, and Rorn. Though some dwell in Southern Argollë, they are otherwise very rare in
the south, where nymphs rather than faeries are found.

Redcaps speak the lilting language of faeries and the languages spoken by the local gnoll,
hobgoblin, and orc tribes.

###### Combat

Redcaps are **preternaturally fast**. They gain a +2 bonus to initiative rolls and have a combat
speed of 120’ per round. As proficient **skirmishers**, they do not suffer an AC penalty when
charging or running and can withdraw or retreat from melee combat without declaring the intention to
do so at the start of the melee round.

Redcaps prefer to hunt their targets with spears, with which they gain a +1 damage bonus. They can
resort to tooth and claw if the spear is broken or if they are feeling particularly bloodthirsty.

Many a would-be hero has found to their ultimate cost that redcaps are quite hard to kill. Redcaps
are **immune** to all mundane damage. However, if the blood staining a redcap’s hat every fully
dries (which takes 24 hours), the redcap is irrevocably slain.

###### Ecology

Redcaps dwell in abandoned hill forts and other ruins that littler Jutland and Ron. Like brownies
and knockers, redcaps do not have women or children of any sort. They reproduce by transforming
particularly vicious or ugly gnoll, hobgoblin, or orc whelps into their own kind in magic rituals
performed in places of power on unholy days. The newborn redcaps remember their old life dimly as if
a dream, which fades with time.

Redcaps do not have to work hard to find victims, because beastmen shamans will regularly offer up
whelps from the tribe to them in exchange for alliance and aid.
