### Crab, Giant

These giant cousins to ordinary crabs are about 12’ in diameter and weigh up to 500 lbs. They can
be found in any watery environment, but because they do not have to remain fully submerged they can
also be found prowling along fresh or saltwater shores, marshes, and watery subterranean caves.
Giant crabs are unintelligent, and exist merely to eat and reproduce.

###### Combat

Because they often dwell in lightless caverns or dark depths, giant crabs rely on **aquatic**
**mechanoreception** (60’ range). Spells or effects that would ordinarily cause blindness do not
affect crab using mechanoreception. However, creatures that are not in the water are invisible to
their mechanoreception. Aquatic mechanoreception does not penetrate structures or terrain features.

When they detect prey, giant crabs attack with their powerful pincers, which deal 2d6 {P}damage
each. If a giant crab successfully attacks the same target with both pincers in the same attack
routine, it immediately **rends** the creature for another 2d6 {Se}damage.

Giant crabs possess the equivalent of Combat Trickery (wrestling). When attacking fast-moving prey,
giant crabs will often use one pincer topin a target with a Wrestling special maneuver, then use the
other pincer to tear them apart.

###### Ecology

When a colony of giant crabs is encountered, there is a 20% chance per crab that it will be
incubating a clutch of 2d6 eggs. The eggs have 1 hp and weigh 3/6 st. Crab hatchlings are rarely
found in colonies, because the hatchlings immediately disperse into the waters after they emerge
from their eggs.

###### Spoils

A slain giant crab can be harvested with Animal Husbandry 2 for the following component:

* carapace fragment (5/6 st, 50gp, armor +2)

If not used for magic research, a giant crab's armored carapace fetches 50gp and weighs 1 2/6 st.

###### Encounter

A limestone cave mouth gapes some 11’ wide and 3’ high in the cliffs near the water’s edge. The
cave’s mouth open into a grotto 21’ in diameter. About half the grotto is submerged by a murky pool;
the rest is cluttered by large, algae-covered boulders. A steady drip from stalactites that loom
above echoes through the cave. Hiding behind several rocks and partially submerged in the pools are
**five giant crabs**. One of the crabs is incubating a clutch of **8 crab eggs**.

At the bottom of the murky pool, invisible from the surface, is a splintered chest of dawn redwood.
The interior lid of the chest is painted with images of the Istrith Forest. It contains 2,000sp and
1,000gp. The chest was hidden here during the evacuation of the elves from the region, and never
reclaimed.
