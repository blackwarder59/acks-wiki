### Pegasus

Magnificent winged horses, the pegasi were made by the Empyrean gods to serve as steeds for the
exalted heroes of the Empyrean War. As recently as the reign of Audarius Ulkyreus XI, the Auran
Empire fielded elite aerophract cavalry mounted on pegasi. Tragically, the last of the winged steeds
died during the civil war that followed the death of Ulkyreus. Today, wild pegasi survive only in
the primordial forests of Northern and Southern Argollë and the high peaks of the Meniri and Jutting
Mountains.

All pegasi have the conformation and poise of a finely-bred light horse. Their coats and feathers
can be cloud white, golden cream, night black, platinum grey, or shimmery silver, while their manes
and tails are often pure white but sometimes gold or blood red. A full-grown pegasi has a wingspan
of 24’ and a weight of 1,000 lbs.

###### Combat

Pegasi are, like horses, relatively easy to frighten (0 Morale). They can overcome their
skittishness through **training for war**. War-trained pegasi gain +2 to morale. The rider of a
war-trained pegasi can attack with a charge, dealing double damage dice with a lance, and a
war-trained pegasi can attack with its hooves during the charge as well.

Even war-trained pegasi fear hippogriffs, however, which are their natural predators. When
hippogriffs are visible, pegasi suffer a -2 penalty to morale rolls, even if the hippogriffs are
controlled or ridden by allies.

###### Ecology

When pegasi are encountered in their aerie, there is a 25% chance each pegasi is guarding
offspring. Roll 1d4 for number and age: 1, it’s 1d3 eggs, 2-4, it’s 1 juvenile. Juvenile pegasi have
AC 1, Spd 180’, HD 1+1, and attack with 1 hoof (1d2 {B}). They cannot fly. Pegasi eggs have 1 hp and
weigh 3 st.

The valuable offspring are not easy to claim. Pegasi defending young do not have to make morale
rolls; they always fight to the death.

###### Spoils

A slain pegasus can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the
following components useful in magic research:

* mane (2/6 st, 20gp, *vigor*)
* wingtips (3/6 st, 27gp, *flight, winged flight*)

A pegasus’ 4d12 flight feathers each fetch 4d6gp and weigh 1/25 st.
