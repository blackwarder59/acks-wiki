### Rhinoceros, Woolly

The woolly rhinoceros is a prehistoric rhino that is larger and covered in a dense, coarse hair.
Larger than their cousins, they weigh up to 7,000lbs. Wooly rhinos are not commonly found in
Aurëpos, but explorers who have ventured north of the Jutting Mountains claim they still dwell in
the vast taiga.

###### Combat

Characters encountering woolly rhinos suffer a -2 penalty to reaction rolls due to the rhinoceros’
foul temper.

Woolly rhinos prefer to start combat by **charging** with their horn, dealing double damage dice
(4d6 {P!}) on a successful charge. After charging, wooly rhinos will attempt to **trample** their
opponents. A rhino gains a +4 bonus to attack throws when trampling a small or man-sized creature.
If struck, the creature takes damage must make a Paralysis saving throw or be forced aside 10’,
landing **prone**. A small creature saves at -6 and a man-sized creature at -4. A rhino can cleave
after a successful trample attack that forces aside a creature.

###### Ecology

When woolly rhinos are encountered, there is a 50% chance the adults will be accompanied by 1d2
juvenile woollies and 1d2-1 baby woollies. Juvenile woollies are large size, have AC 3, Spd 90’, HD
4, and attack by trampling (1d12 {B}). Juvenile woollies can only take a +4 bonus versus and force
aside small creatures, which save at -4. Baby woollies are man-sized, have AC 2, Spd 90’, HD 2+2,
and attack by stomping (1d4 {B}).

###### Spoils

A slain woolly rhino can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the
following component useful in magic research:

* horn (6 stone, 600gp, *cure disease, discern poison, force of impetus, neutralize poison,
striking*, weapon +1)

If not used for magic research, a woolly rhino’s horn fetches 3d3x100gp and weighs 1 st per 450gp
value. A woolly rhino’s hide weighs 19 st and fetches 140gp if used for armor or 325gp if used for
fur.

Wolly rhinos are surly and stupid, and rarely trained.
