### Ghoul, Desert

These cannibalistic monstrosities are common to the deserts of Aurëpos. In their natural form, they
appear as bestial, crouched humanoids with hyena-like features. More often, however, they appear in
the form of those they have devoured.

Desert ghouls delight in feasting on the innocent, and enjoy masquerading as children and old women
right up until the moment they attack. If unable to feed, desert ghouls begin to rot like the
corpses they are.

###### Combat

By expending a movement action, a desert ghoul can take on the form of the last humanoid creature
it has eaten. When transformed, the desert ghoul gains the exact physical qualities (including
height, weight, gender, hair color, hair texture, skin color, voice, and facial features) of the new
form, but not any mental characteristics, special abilities, or equipment. The desert ghoul can
transform back into its natural form instantly at the start of its initiative without expending an
action.

Desert ghouls’ transformations are **horrific** to witness. When a desert ghoul transforms, each
creature that beholds it must make a Paralysis saving throw. If the save fails, the creature is
**cowering** until the end of its next initiative and thereafter gains immunity to the effects of
every ghoul’s horrific transformation for 1 turn. If the save succeeds, the creature is not affected
and immediately gains immunity to the effects of every ghoul’s horrific transformation for 1 turn.

Like other ghouls, desert ghouls attack with claws and bite. Any humanoid creature that suffers the
loss of 50% or more of its total hp fighting desert ghouls is infected with **ghoul fever** and will
become a desert ghoul in 2d6 days. This transformation can be prevented with the divine spell *cure
disease* if cast before the disease has taken full hold.

As undead, desert ghouls are immune to enchantment effects, necrotic damage, and poisonous damage.
They are inherently evil for purposes of *discern evil*and *holy circle*spells. They are rebuked as
ghouls.

###### Ecology

Because they can pose as ordinary men and women, desert ghouls can thrive in populated villages,
towns, and cities.

###### Spoils

A destroyed desert ghoul can be harvested Healing 2 for the following components useful in magic
research:

* claws (4/6 st., 40gp, *cause disease*)
* skin (4/6 st., 40gp, *adjust self, inspire horror*)

###### Lore

*Mahmoud’s fifth wife, Aliya, was as beautiful as a goddess, yet as cruel as a demoness. Though the
warlock quickly grew weary of Aliya’s mockery, his marital vows could not be broken without bringing
war with her father Majid. When, by kismet, Aliya was devoured by a ghūl, Mahmoud had the thing
brought to his palace and by black lore enslaved it to her form forever. Thereafter, Aliya was
deemed by all to be Mahmoud’s most docile, obedient, and well-fed wife*.
