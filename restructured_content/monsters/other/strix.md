### Strix

A strix (plural striges) resembles a cross between a bat and an owl. It has a large head with
forward-facing eyes and a hook beak with grey-white bat wings. Its body is about 2’ long, with a
wingspan of about 5', and a weight around 9 lbs. Like a bat, a strix is a nocturnal predator that
rests hanging upside down by day and hunts by night. Striges are considered birds of ill omen in
Nicean legend and harbingers of war in Tirenean myth.

###### Combat

Striges navigate and hunt with **echolocation** (600’ range). No spells or effects that would
ordinarily blind a creature will affect a strix, but *inaudible* creatures are hidden from them, and
*noiselessness* blinds them.

If a strix damages a target with its beak, the strix latches onto the target and begins **drinking
blood**. Once latched on, the strix can use its combat action to automatically deal another 1d3 {N}
damage to the creature each round.

Creatures that are having their blood drunk by a strix can still move, but count as carrying an
extra stone of encumbrance. The strix moves with the creature it is latched onto. A strix will
remain attached to a target until the target dies or the strix is killed.

###### Ecology

When striges are encountered in their nest, there is a 75% chance the adults will be rearing
offspring. Roll 1d4 for age and number: 1-2 it’s 3d6 eggs, 3-4 it’s 1d8 hatchlings. Hatchling
striges have AC 0, Spd 30’, 1 hp, ML -4, and do not fight. Strige eggs have 1 hp and weigh 1/100 st.

###### Spoils

A slain striges can harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the
following components useful in magic research:

* hooked beak (1/6 st., 3gp, *life transfer*)
* wingtips (1/6 st., 3gp, *flight*)

A strix’s 6d10 flight feathers each fetch 1d2sp and weigh 1/225 st.

###### Encounter

A narrow crevice breaks the rock face along the only path through a torturously-sloped broken
ridge. The area around the crevice is littered with the bones and carcasses of dead animals and
humanoids. A character with Animal Husbandry or Healing proficiency that inspects the dead creatures
will discover they were all drained of blood from tiny puncture wounds. A thorough search of the
remains (1 turn) will unearth a wrought gold necklace set with garnets (900gp) and a pair of jade
earrings shaped like dangling dragons (1,100gp). Searching characters will be attacked after 1d6
rounds by the **16 striges** who lair in the crevice.

**Striges (16):** MV 40’ / 360’ fly, AC 2, HD 1/2\*, hp 3 each, #AT 1 (beak 11+), Dmg 1d3 {P} +
blood drain, Save F1, ML +1, AL N, XP 6; Special: blood drain, echolocation
