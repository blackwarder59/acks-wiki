### Skittering Maw

A hideous creation of the malignant mage Vermeren, the skittering maw has the body of a giant
centipede and the head of a great white shark. Growing to over 30' in length and 4,000 lbs in
weight, the skittering maw prefers dark, wet locations and stagnant waters.

###### Combat

Like the great white sharks from which they were bred, skittering maws have **acute olfaction**
that grants them a +1 bonus to avoid surprise in their native habitat.

Due to their great size, skittering maws are even more **poisonous** than their centipede
progenitors. Any creature damaged by a skittering maw’s bite must make a successful Death saving
throw or die in 1 turn.

###### Ecology

When a nest of skittering maws is encountered, there is a 15% chance per maw that it will be
incubating a clutch of 1d6 eggs. The eggs have 1 hp and weigh 1/6 st. Skittering maw hatchlings are
rarely found in nests, because the larvae immediately disperse into the wild after they emerge from
their eggs.

###### Spoils

A slain skittering maw can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for
the following components useful in magic research:

* dorsal fine (8 2/6 st, 500gp, *swimming,* armor +1)
* fangs (10 st, 600gp, *poison,* weapon +2)
* gills (8 2/6 st, 500gp, desiccate, water breathing)

If not used for magic research, a skittering maw’s fangs fetch 20gp and weigh 2/6 st. Its venom
(onset time 1 round, +1 saving modifier, 8d6 {Po} damage on failed Death saving throw) fetches 700gp
and weighs 1/6 st.

###### Encounter

An archway, some 105’ wide and 20’ high, was long ago carved into a rocky slope by a fast-running
stream. The archway opens into a stream-cut tunnel that runs 120’ inward, terminating in an
underground lake within a cavern 215’ long, 150’ wide, with 20’ high ceilings. The lake, 25’ deep at
its center, is the lair of a mated **pair of skittering maws**.

Any characters who traverse the lake will discover that the far wall of the cavern has been
hand-carved with elven runes. Below the runes, the cavern floor is inscribed with a summoning
circle, within which sits a patinated copper *basin of conjuring water elementals*. A water-logged
oak box, about 12” x 6” x 6” sits adjacent to the circle. It is actually a *collapsible boat.* Its
command word, “*uisce,*” is the elven word for water.

**Skittering maws (2):** Spd 60’/180’ swim, AC 5, HD 8\*\*, hp 43, 32, #AT 1 (bite 3+), Dmg 2d10
{P!} + poison, Save F4, ML+4, AL N, Special: poison bite
