### Salamander, Frost

The frost salamander is a kind of intelligent water elemental. It resembles a giant six-legged
lizard with ice-white scales. A typical specimen measures 16' to 20' in length and weighs around
2,600 lbs.

Frost salamanders speak their own tongue, which sounds like ice cracking. They virtually never
speak any other languages. Frost salamanders and flame salamanders despise one another and will
always fight if in the same vicinity.

###### Combat

An **aura of intense cold** surrounds a frost salamander in a 20’ radius. Any creature that begins
its initiative in, or moves into, the aura suffers 1d8 {C!} damage and must make a Blast saving
throw. If the save fails, the creature becomes **hypothermic**. If already hypothermic, it loses 1
CON.

The claws a frost salamander deal 1d6 {C!} {S!} damage, while its bite deals 2d6 {C!} {P!} damage.

Flame salamanders are **immune** to enchantment effects, to fire damage and to mundane bludgeoning,
piercing, and slashing damage. They can held at bay by *holy circle.* If summoned, they can
bedispelled with *counterspell* or *dispel magic*.

###### Ecology

These creatures prefer to live in icy and cold regions. Frost salamanders and flame salamanders
despise one another and will always fight if in the same vicinity.

###### Spoils

A slain frost salamander can be harvested with Alchemy 2 for the following components useful in
magic research:

* white ichor (35 st, 2,100gp, *bane-rune, cone of frost, deflect ordinary weapons, energy
protection (cold)*, *frostbite, ice floe, ice sheet, ice storm, wall of frost,* armor +2)

###### Encounter

A 24’ high waterfall spilling over a 65’ wide crest of limestone and sandstone has frozen over,
transforming the cascade into a curtain of ice adorned with giant icicles. Someone or something has
gouged a 6’ diameter hole at the base of the icy curtain. The opening leads to a 15’ wide cave that
runs the length of the falls, chiseled out by the incessant falling water prior to its freezing.
Lairing in the cave are **three frost salamanders.** The bone-chilling cold which emanates from
these creatures is responsible for the miracle of the frozen falls.

**Frost Salamanders (3):** MV 120’, AC 6, HD 12\*, hp 65 each #AT 5 (4 claws/bite 1+), Dmg 1d6 {C!}
{S!} per claw) / 2d6 {C!} {P!}, Save F12, ML 0, AL C, XP 2,100; Special: aura of cold

In the back of the cave there is a large wall of ice with five preserved bodies. If the salamanders
are slain, the wall will slowly melt; this will take 1d6 hours, but can be reduced to as little as
one turn with appropriate fire sources. All of the dead wear cloaks and armor stitched with the
insignia of a silver hammer*.* They are *The Hammers of Türas,* an adventuring band that disappeared
about ten years ago
