### Troll

Trolls were created by the alchemy of the ancient Zaharans, who crossbreed ogres with hydras to
create an unkillable predator. Full-grown adult trolls stand 10’ - 11' tall and weigh about 850 lbs,
but their gaunt frames hide their great strength. Their rubbery hides are either moss green, mottled
green and gray, or putrid gray, while their hair is either greenish black or iron grey, and their
eyes are a glowing amber or yellow.

They live to kill, however, and enjoy eating other intelligent humanoids. Trolls tend to lair in
dungeons, caverns, ruins, and swamps.

###### Combat

Trolls normally attack with their claws and teeth, dealing 1d6 extraordinary slashing and 1d10
extraordinary piercing damage respectively. If a troll successfully attacks the same target with
both claws in the same attack routine, it immediately **rends** the target for an additional 2d8
{Se!} damage. If the rend kills the target, the troll can cleave with its claw.

What makes trolls truly terrifying is their ability to regenerate. Trolls regain 3 hp at the start
of their initiative each round. If a troll is reduced to 0 hp, it becomes incapacitated, but it will
continue to regenerate and stand again to fight when it regenerates to 1 or more hp. If, due to a
spell or permanent wound, a troll loses a body part, the parts will act on the troll’s initiative,
squirming at 5’ per round back toward the torso to reattach. (If it loses its head, the torso will
move to the head.) A troll can reattach a severed member, including its head in lieu of one of its
claw attacks simply by holding it to the stump. However, trolls cannot regenerate acidic or fire
damage and if reduced to 0 hp by such are slain. When confronted by creatures equipped with fire or
acid, trolls’ morale drops to 0.

###### Ecology

Each troll gang will be led by a champion with 6 AC 6, 7+3 HD, and 51 hp. A troll lair or village
will be led by a chieftain with 8 AC, 10+6 HD, 63 hp, and a +2 damage bonus. As long as the
chieftain is alive, the trolls will gain a +2 bonus to morale rolls.

When trolls are encountered in a village, certain additional creatures will be present. There will
be females and whelps equal to 100% the number of males in the village each. Female trolls fight as
ogres, while whelps fight as orcs. The chieftain will be accompanied by a sub-chieftain and 1d4
bodyguards. These will have 7 AC, 8+3 HD, 45 hp, and a +2 damage bonus. In addition, a troll village
has a 50% chance of a shaman being present, and a 25% chance of a witch doctor. A shaman is
equivalent to a sub-chieftain statistically, but has the abilities of a shaman of level 1d4. A witch
doctor is equivalent to a champion, but has the abilities of a mage of level 1d2.

###### Spoils
