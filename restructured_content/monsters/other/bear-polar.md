### Bear, Polar

These bears live in the freezing climates of Danae north of the Jutting Mountains. During very cold
winters, polar bears have been known to cross the snowy passes and range across Jutland and Rorn.
Polar bears average about 11' tall and can weigh as much as 1,400 lbs.

###### Combat

Polar bears are almost purely carnivorous and highly aggressive. All creatures suffer a -4 reaction
roll penalty when encountering them.

Like other bears, they have **acute olfaction** and gain a +1 bonus to avoid surprise in their
natural habitat. They can track the scent of creatures for up to 6 miles with the equivalent of
three ranks of Tracking proficiency. They are **adept at swimming** (as Swimming proficiency) and
**surefooted on snow**, allowing them to ignore the movement penalties from Snowy conditions.

If a polar bear successfully attacks the same target with both claws in the same attack routine, it
immediately **hugs** the target for an additional 2d8 {B} damage. If the hug kills the target, the
bear can cleave with its claw.

###### Ecology

When polar bears are encountered in a wilderness den, there is a 66% chance the adults will be
rearing bear cubs. Roll 1d4 for their age; 1-2, it’s 1d2+1 babies, 3-4 it’s 1d3-1 juveniles.
Juvenile polar bears have AC 2, Spd 90’, HD 3+2, and attack with two claws (1d3 {S}) and bite (1d6
{S}). Baby cave bears have AC 1, Spd 90’, HD 2+1, and attack with two scritches (1 {S}) and one
nibble (1d2 {P}).

###### Spoils

A slain polar bear with exceptional attributes can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor
(Butchery) for the following components useful in magic research:

* claws (4 stone, 240gp, *ice floe, ice sheet, iron maiden, swift sword*)
* stomach (3 2/6 st, 200gp, *call of the wild bear, protection from temperature, slumber*)

A polar bear's pelt fetches 200gp and weighs 3 4/6 st.

Polar bears are rather more difficult to train than their smaller cousins.

###### Encounter

The snow-blanketed landscape is pierced by a burrowed hole, about 4’ in diameter. Close inspection
of the hole reveals icicles of blood and white hairs frozen along its edge. Lingering too long, or
entering the hole itself, earns the ire of the **polar bear** within, which will aggressively charge
the adventurers. Characters clambering into the hole will discover a 10’ long tunnel that terminates
in a large burrow filled with bones.

Polar bear: Spd 120’, AC 4, HD 7, hp 37, #AT 3 (2 claws/bite 4+), Dmg 1d8 {S} /1d8 {S} /2d6 {S} ,
Save F3, ML +1, AL N, XP 440; Special: hug (2d8 {B} if both claws strike in one round)
