### Scorpion, Giant

These aggressive giant cousins to scorpions are about 6' long and weigh about 230 lbs. According to
Empyrean and Zaharan myth, giant scorpions were born of the Predestined War. When Ianna, Empyrean
goddess of war, cut the belly of Galmorm, Chthonic god of poison, his demonic ichor fell upon
ordinary scorpions and transformed them into monstrous giants. Whether the myth is true or not, the
cultists of Galmorm revere the deadly arachnids, and some temples even go so far as to rear and
breed them.

###### Combat

Giant scorpions have **acute olfaction** and gain a +1 bonus to avoid surprise in their native
habitat. Their exoskeletons are covered with tiny bristles that grant the scorpions **aerial
mechanoreception** to a range of 60’.

In combat, giant scorpions attacks with their pincers and stinger. If a scorpion successfully hits
a creature with both of its pincers, it automatically hits with its **venomous stinger**. Any
creature damaged by the scorpion’s stinger must make a Death saving throw or die at the end of the
scorpion’s initiative.

###### Ecology

When a nest of giant scorpions is encountered, there is a 5% chance each scorpion is carrying 2d12
baby scorplings in its brood sac. These baby scorplings will be near birth and can be captured if
the scorpion is killed.

###### Spoils

A slain giant scorpion can be harvested with Animal Husbandry 2 for the following components useful
in magic research:

* carapace (3/6 st, 35gp, armor +2)
* stinger (1 4/6 st, 100gp, *poison, swift strike*)

If not used for magic research, a scorpion's stinger fetches 4gp and weighs 4/6 st. Its venom
(onset time 1 turn, +2 saving modifier, 2d10 {Po} damage on failed Death saving throw) fetches 400gp
and weighs 1/6 st.

Like all arachnids, giant scorpions are cunning enough to learn but so hostile as to be almost
untrainable.

###### Encounter

An ancient stream once pierced the cliff face here, leaving an arched-shaped opening, some 40’ wide
and 30’ high, into a cavern beyond. The stream itself has gone dry, leaving just a dusty wadi that
leads into the darkness like a sunken trail. During the day, the cavern is home to a nest of **six
giant scorpions**.At night, the scorpions hunt in the vicinity.

**Giant scorpions (6):** Spd 150’, AC 7, HD 4\*, hp 20 each, #AT 3 (2 claws/sting 7+), Dmg 1d10 {P}
/1d10 {P} /1d4 {P} + poison, Save F2, ML +3, AL C, XP 135; Special: venomous stinger

Nailed to the rear wall of the cave is a wrought silver holy symbol of Galmorm, Chthonic god of
thievery, treachery, and poison. The symbol is shaped in the form of a striking scorpion and adorned
with opals (2,000gp value).
