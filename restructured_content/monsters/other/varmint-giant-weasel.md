### Varmint, Giant Weasel

These horse-sized hunters measure around 9' long and weigh around 2,000 lbs. They are skilled
burrowers and live in the tunnels they create in the earth.

###### Combat

Giant weasels have **acute hearing** and **acute olfaction.** They gain a +2 bonus to avoid
surprise in their natural habitat. They can track the scent of creatures for up to 2 miles with the
equivalent of one rank of Tracking proficiency. They are also **skilled climbers**, able to ascend
sheer surfaces as if they were thieves (5+).

If a giant weasel damages a target with its bite, it clamps onto it and begins **draining
blood**.Once clamped on, the weasel can use its combat action to automatically deal 2d4 necrotic
damage to the creature each round. Creatures that are having their blood drained by a giant weasel
can still move but count as carrying an extra 40 st of encumbrance. The weasel moves with the
creature from which it is drinking blood. It will continue cling until either the creature dies or
the weasel has been killed.

###### Ecology

When giant weasels are encountered in a wilderness den, the weasels will be rearing 1d4 juvenile
weasels and 1d4 baby weasels. Juveniles have AC 0, Spd 120’, HD 2+2 and attack with 1 bite (1d4
{P}). Babies have AC -1, Spd 120’, HD 1+2, and attack with 1 nasty nibble (1 {P}).

###### Spoils

A giant weasel corpse can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the
following components useful in magic research:

* teeth (2 st., 115gp, *cause light injury, life transfer*)
* whiskers (1 4/6 st., 100gp, *locate animal or plant*)

A giant weasel's pelt fetches 115gp and weighs 4/6gp.

Giant weasels are harder to train than giant ferrets, but their great size makes them more valuable
as hunters. Kobolds, in particular, have great affinity for them.

###### Encounter

Below the scrub-land lies a complex burrow consisting of a grid of 3’-8’ diameter tunnels that
intersect at feeding chambers, nests, toilets, and food storage chambers, each about 15’ to 20’
square. A total of seven exits lead from the burrow to the surface, visible from the surface as kick
outs of excavated soil and freshly-cut shrubs. The burrows are home to a sneak of **three giant
weasels** along with their offspring, **two juvenile weasels** and **one baby weasel**.
