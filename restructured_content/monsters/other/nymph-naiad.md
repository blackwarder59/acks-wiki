### Nymph, Naiad

Naiads are water nymphs that appear as beautiful elf-like women with greenish, bluish, or
green-gray skin color. They are similar to dryads in many ways, but much more sociable than the
reclusive tree-nymphs. Naiads are found in the rivers, streams, lakes, and ponds of southern
Aurëpos, particularly in Nicea, Krysea, Southern Argollë, and Tirenea. They are very rare in the
north, where faeries rather than nymphs reign.

Like other nymphs, most naiads speak Classical Nicean as well as the local dialect of their region.
They do not have their own language.

###### Combat

Each naiad is **spiritually united** with a particular body of fresh water, such as a lake or
river. If a naiad is ever more than 720’ from her home waters, she loses 1d3 hp per round until she
dies or moves back in range. If a naiad’s home waters ever dry up, the naiad withers and dies, too.

Like a dryad, a naiad can use **bewitch humanoid**at will as a spell-like ability. The effect is
identical to that of the spell except that it has a duration of 12 months. Naiads will use their
bewitchment to defend themselves from opponents where necessary – and to enthrall mates where
possible.

Should a naiad successfully bewitchan elven or human man with a CHA score of 16+, the naiad will
beckon the hapless victim to join her in a life under the sea. Fortunately for the victim, naiads
can grant *water breathing* at will as a spell-like ability, with a duration of 24 hours. Naiads
generally release their victims after mating, though some men find it better down where it’s wetter
and chose to stay.

If bewitchment fails to halt intruders, naiads will retreat into their home waters, where each
naiad can call on the aid of a pet **giant lake- or river-fish**. (Use the characteristics of a
giant piranha but with ML 0 and no frenzy.) If all else fails, naiads will defend themselves in
melee with tiny daggers made of sea-shells and coral.

###### Ecology

Since naiads never stray from their home waters, the lair roll actually determines whether the
naiad dwells alone or dwells in a school with other naiads.

Naiads live long lives of eternal youth, and typically give birth to just one child in that time,
always in union with a betwitched mate. There is a 7% chance for each naiad encountered to be
rearing a young naiad. Roll 1d4 to determine her age: 1, she’s a baby naiad; 2-4, she’s a juvenile
naiad. Baby and juvenile naiads both have AC 0, Spd 90’, 1 hp, ML -4, and do not fight. Neither
juveniles nor babies have spell-like abilities.

###### Spoils

A naiad corpse can be harvested with Healing 1 for the following components useful in magic
research:

* gills (10 per 1 st., 6gp, *bewitch beasts, swimming, water breathing*)
* tears (10 per 1 st., 6gp, *allure, bewitch humanoid, enslave humanoid*)
