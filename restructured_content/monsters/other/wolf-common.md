### Wolf, Common

Wolves are pack hunters that can be found thriving anywhere from the slopes of the Meniri Mountains
to the taiga beyond the Jutting Mountains. Common wolves are 6’ long and 3’ tall at the shoulder and
weigh about 175 lbs.

###### Combat

Common wolves have **acute hearing** and **acute olfaction.** They gain a +2 bonus to avoid
surprise in their natural habitat. They can track the scent of creatures for up to 4 miles with the
equivalent of two ranks of Tracking proficiency.

As pack hunters, common wolves are more confident when they have greater numbers. If encountered in
or reduced to a pack of 4 or fewer, their morale score is reduced by 1.

###### Ecology

Each pack or route of common wolves will be led by chief (who fights as a dire wolf).

When common wolves are encountered in their den, the adults will be rearing 1d6 puppies. Roll 1d6
for age; 1-4, they’re juveniles wolves, 5-6 they’re babies. Juvenile wolves have AC 0, Spd 150’, HD
1+1, and attack with 1 bite (1d2 {P}). Baby wolves have AC -1, Spd 150’, HD ½, and attack with 1
nibble (1 {P}).

###### Spoils

A slain wolf with exceptional attributes can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery)
or Trapping for the following component useful in magic research:

* teeth (3/6 st, 35gp, *call of the wolf, call of the wolf pack, skinchange*)

A wolf’s pelt fetches 15gp and weighs 3/6 st.

Wolves can be readily tamed and trained, especially if captured when young. They can learn to be
both guards and hunters.

###### Encounter

Dug in the soft soil near a riverbank hollow is a small, 2’ wide hole surrounded by a large pile of
dirt. A series of animal trails radiate from the hole; characters with Tracking proficiency can
identify them as wolf tracks. The hole leads to a tunnel 15’ long, terminating in a wolf’s den about
4’ square, littered with small bones. Inside, **one wolf** (hp 12) is nuzzling **three wolf cubs**.
The rest of the pack, another **ten wolves**, prowls the vicinity, and will rush back to protect the
den in 1d6 rounds.

**Wolves (11):** MV 180’, AC 2, HD 2+2, hp 16, 15, 13, 12, 12, 12, 11, 10, 10, 9, 6, #AT 1 (bite
8+), Dmg 1d6 {P}, Save F1, ML 0, AL N, XP 35; Special: pack fighter (-1 morale if pack reduced to
50%)

**Wolf cubs (3):** MV 150’, AC 0, HD 1+1, hp 5, #AT 1 (bite 9+), Dmg 1d2 {P}, Save NM, ML 0, AL N,
XP 15
