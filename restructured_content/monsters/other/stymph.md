### Stymph

Stymphs are rapacious man-eating cranes with brazen beaks and feathers. They stand about 3’ tall
and have a wingspan of around 6’ and weight of about 15lbs.

###### Combat

Stymphs have **acute vision** and gain a +1 bonus to avoid surprise in its natural habitat.

A stymph’s flight feathers can be flung like darts to wound their prey. A stymph can throw two
flight feathers per round while airborne. Flight feathers can hit targets up to 180’ away (no range
penalties apply) and deal 1d4 {P} damage each. A stymph can throw up to 6 flight feathers without
losing its capability to fly; a stymph will typically have 2d3 feathers available at the start of an
encounter. Once a stymph has flung all of its available feathers, it will attack its prey in melee
with its beak. The beak is armor-piercing, granting a +2 bonus to the stymph’s attack throws.

Despite their ferocity, stymphs are easily frightened (reflected in their low morale score of -2).

###### Ecology

The stymph’s legendary rapacity is due to the high metabolic cost of replacing its feathers. A
well-fed stymph can regrow flung feathers at a rate of two per day; a hungry stymph will be lucky to
replace one per month. Stymphs have been known to collect and consume small bits of metal such as
coins, daggers, and ingots, but whether this is vital to the re-growth of their feathers is not
known to the sages of Aurëpos.

Like most birds, stymphs congregate in flocks and nests. When stymphs are encountered in their
nest, there is a 75% chance the adults will be rearing offspring. Roll 1d10 for age and number: 1
it’s 4d10 eggs, 2-10 it’s 2d10 hatchlings. Hatchling stymphs have AC 0, Spd 30’, 1hp, ML -4, and do
not fight. Stymph eggs have 1 hp and weigh 1/25 st.

###### Spoils

A slain stymphs can harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the
following components useful in magic research:

* beak (1/6 st, 7gp, weapon +1)
* flight feathers (1/6 st, 6gp, *flight, mage missile, regeneration*)

If not used for magic research, a stymph’s 6d10 flight feathers each fetch 1d2sp and weigh 1/225 st.

###### Encounter

A sprawling network of intertwined branches, brazen feathers, and scraps of metal armor clings to a
cliff’s rocky outcrops and ledges. The sprawl is home to a storm of **26 stymphs**, which have made
a nest here to raise **12 hatchling stymphs**.

**Stymphs (26):** Sped 30’ / 240’ fly, AC 5, HD 1\*, hp 5 each, #AT 2 (feathers 10+) or 1 (bite
10+), Dmg 1d4 {P} or 1d6 {P}, Save F2, ML -2, XP 13

**Stymph hatchlings (12):** Spd 30’, HD ¼, hp 1 each, ML -4, XP 0.

The stymph’s nest incorporates a number of bits and pieces of metallic treasure, including
14,000cp, 8,000sp, and a shiny hauberk of *chain mail +1*. Since the nest is over 100’ up the side
of the cliff, extracting the treasure from it will be a difficult challenge for adventurers that
lack the ability to levitate or fly.
