### Herald Angel

Herald angels are powerful extraplanar entities that serve as emissaries and enforces of the
Empyrean gods. Appearing as winged humans of great beauty and majesty dressed in shining armor,
herald angels are fiery, forceful, and fearsome, but always just in their dealings with all beings.

Herald Angels natively speak the Empyrean tongue of the high gods. Those sent to Aurëpos as heralds
will also speak the languages of the region to which they are assigned.

###### Combat

In melee, herald angels fight with **blazing two-handed swords** that deal 5d10 {L!} {S!} damage.
Once per turn, the herald angel can use its sword to discharge a **blast of luminous fire** in a 60’
long and 30’ wide cone. Each creature within the area of effect must make a Blast saving throw. If
the save fails, the creature suffers 13d6 {L!} damage and is **blinded** for 3d6 rounds. If the save
succeeds, the creature takes half that damage and is not blinded. A herald angel’s sword melts into
slag if the herald angel is dispelled or slain.

Herald angels are **potent spellcasters**, able to cast spells as 13th-level crusaders. In
addition, they possess the following spell-like abilities: *cure disease*, *discern evil*, *dispel
magic*, *invisibility*, *perpetual illumination*, *remove curse*, and *remove fear* (all at will);
*cure serious injuries* and *fiery pillar* (thrice per day); and *restore life and limb* (once per
day).

At all times, a herald angel radiates an **aura of glory** in a 30’ radius around itself. Any
Lawful creature that begins its initiative in, or moves into, the aura becomes **inspired** until
they start their initiative outside the aura.

Any Neutral or Chaotic creature that begins its initiative in or moves into the aura must make a
Spells saving throw. If the save succeeds, the creature is immune to the aura for one day. If the
save fails, the effects depend on the creature’s alignment.

* Neutral creatures become **mesmerized** by the angel until the angel attacks them or they start
their initiative outside the aura.
* Chaotic creatures become **cowed** by the angel until they start their initiative outside the
aura or until the angel attacks them. When the angel attacks them, they become **frightened** until
they start their initiative outside the aura.

Herald angels are **immune** to luminous damage, poisonous damage, and all mundane damage. As holy
beings, they can be detected with *discern good*, held at bay by *unholy circle* and destroyed with
*dispel good.* If summoned, they can be dispelled by *counterspell* or *dispel magic*.

###### Ecology

Herald angels rarely appear on Aurëpos except when called forth by a spell or pinnacle of good.
Sometimes, however, they are found guarding holy shrines or relics of Law.
