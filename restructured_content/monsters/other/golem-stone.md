### Golem, Stone

Stone golems are 10’ tall magical constructs made of granite, marble, or other statuary stone,
weighing around 1 ton. Most stone golems are fastened to resemble kings or lords. Creating one
involves the employment of mighty magic by exceptionally powerful clerics and mages.

Like most constructs, stone golems have no true intelligence. The magic that animates them imbues
them with just enough sapience to follow simple or standing orders from their creators.

###### Combat

When encountered, a stone golem’s reactions are always determined by its creator’s orders (even if
given long, long ago).

In combat, stone golems smash foes with a powerful punch or large weapon. When armed with a large
piercing or slashing weapon, stone golems deal **vicious blows** that inflict an additional 2 points
of damage per hit. When armed with a large bludgeoning weapon, stone golems can **topple** man-sized
or smaller creatures with every attack. A small or man-sized creature struck by a stone golem’s
smash must make a size-adjusted Paralysis saving throw. If the save fails, the creature takes damage
and is knocked **prone**. If the save succeeds, the creatures take damage but stays on its feet. The
stone golem can cleave after a successful attack that topples its target.

In addition, on the first round of combat and every 5 rounds thereafter, a stone golem can breathe
out a 10’ x 10’ x 10’ **cloud of heavy clogging dust.** Each creature within the area of effect must
make a Poison saving throw or immediately become **queasy** for 2d6 rounds.

Stone golems are very hard to hurt. A stone golem is **immune** to enchantment effects, all mundane
damage; and virtually all extraordinary damage except extraordinary seismic damage. *Disintegration,
depetrification, earth’s mire,* and *earth’s hardening* have special effects:

* *Disintegration* can destroy a stone golem.
* *Depetrification* spell cannot harm a stone golem, but it automatically removes its immunity to
damage until the start of the same initiative count on the following round.
* *Earth’s mire* automatically causes a stone golem to become **queasy** for 2d6 rounds.
* *Earth’s hardening* automatically restores all of a stone golem’s lost hit points.

As constructs, they count as enchanted creatures for purposes of spells such as *dispel evil*and
*holy circle*.

###### Ecology

As constructs, stone golems have no natural habitat. They can be found guarding ancient treasures,
dwarven vaults, or places of power or serving powerful spellcasters.
