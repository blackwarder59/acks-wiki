### Lizard, Giant Tuatara

The giant tuatara is an 8' long 250 lb carnivore with formidable spikes that run the length of its
dorsal side. The sages of the Tower of Knowledge believe that giant tuatara, along with other
species of giant lizard, were bred from ordinary lizards as fighting beasts and pets by the ancient
Thrassians.

Whatever their origin, giant tuatara are now widespread throughout the known world. They are
frequently found in the coastal forests and shrublands of Aurëpos as well as across the Syrnasos
Islands.

###### Combat

Tuataras are nocturnal predators. They hunt primarily by ambush, waiting motionless for prey to
come within range. A special membrane-like eyelid over a tuatara’s eyes grants it **lightless
vision** to 90’.

###### Ecology

When a wilderness lair of giant tuataras is encountered, there is a 10% chance per lizard that it
will have buried a clutch of 1d10+5 eggs nearby. The eggs have 1 hp and weight 1/6 st. Tuatara
hatchlings are rarely found in nests, because the creatures immediately disperse into the wild after
they emerge from their eggs.

###### Spoils

A slain giant tuatara can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the
following component:

* eyelids (5 2/6 st, 320gp, *lightless vision, mass lightless vision,* armor +1, weapon +1

Adventurers sometimes attempt to capture and rear giant tuatara, but the creatures are quite stupid
and surly and take a very long time to mature. Few would-be lizard trainers have the patient to wait
decades.

###### Encounter

A great oak snag stands here, some 46’ tall and 21’ in circumference. Its top branches have
withered away, while a hollow at its base leads into an underground cavity, 8’ deep and 12’ in
diameter, from which extend seven tunnels, each about 6’ in diameter. Excavated from amongst its
dead roots, these burrows are the lair of **three giant tuatara**. The tuatara are perpetually
hungry and will emerge to attack adventurers who bypass the lair. **Six tuatara eggs** are hidden
among the roots in the burrow.
