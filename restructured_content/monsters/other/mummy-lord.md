### Mummy Lord

Mummy lords are long-dead kings, high lords and sorcerers transformed by necromantic arts into
powerful undead. To guarantee the mummy lord’s survival until the time of the Awakening, special
sorceries are used to bind their souls not just to their bodies, but to canopic vessels which
contain their preserved vital organs.

###### Combat

Mummy lords possess the proficiencies and special abilities of the characters they were in life –
usually crusaders, fighters, mages, priestesses, or ruinguards of 11th level or higher.

Like all mummies, mummy lords have a **horrific** **visage**. When a creature first beholds one or
more mummies, and at the start of each round thereafter that it continues to do so, the creature
must make a Paralysis saving throw. The save suffers a -1 penalty per additional mummy after the
first. If the save fails, the creature is **cowering** until the start of the next round. If the
save succeeds, the creature gains immunity to the effects of every mummy’s horrific visage for 1
turn.

The evil rituals used to create mummy lords imbue the monsters with the spell-like abilities to
**bestow curse**and **bewitch humanoid** at will, **summon insect plague**once per day, and **summon
weather**once per week.

Like mummies, mummy lords can attack with great blows of preternatural strength that deal 1d12 {B!}
{N!} damage. However, the tomb of a mummy lord is always well-appointed with grave goods, and if the
monster was a warrior in life, its **weapons and armor** will be available for the mummy lord’s use.
If armored, increase the mummy lord’s AC  by the value of any armor or shield equipped. If armed,
mummy lords deal extraordinary damage by weapon +4 (plus any fighter damage bonus, where
appropriate). The weapons deal {N!} damage in addition to their damage type.

Any creature damaged by a mummy lord’s attack (slam or weapon) starts **rotting**. Rotting
creatures gradually begin to bruise, bleed from their orifices, and slough off hair and skin. They
take 1 {N!} damage at dusk each day and cannot benefit from magical healing until the condition
ends. The condition ends when the creature dies or when the rot is cured with *cure disease*.

Exceptionally powerful magic is used to preserve mummy lords from the effects of age, mold, and
rot. As a result, mummies are **immune** to enchantment effects, to necrotic and poisonous damage,
and to mundane acidic, bludgeoning, cold, electric, piercing, seismic, and slashing damage. They are
**resistant** to mundane fire damage and to extraordinary acidic, bludgeoning, cold, electric,
piercing, seismic, and slashing damage. Extraordinary fire damage and mundane or extraordinary
luminous damage have full effect.

When a mummy lord is reduced to zero hit points (or otherwise physically destroyed), its
disembodied spirit returns to the **canopic jar** containing its organs, while its body instantly
breaks apart into an **insect swarm**. The swarm will be 30' × 30' in size, centered on the point
where the mummy lord’s body was destroyed. The swarm immediately inflicts 2 extraordinary necrotic
piercing damage to any creature engulfed, or double that to unarmored creatures. The swarm cannot be
damaged, but disperses at the end of the next round.

The insects will converge on the mummy lord’s tomb 1d10 nights later, where they re-form the mummy
lord’s body. The monster’s disembodied spirit then re-takes possession of its body, at full hit
points. However, if the tomb is utterly sealed against insects (possible only through magic) then
its body cannot re-form; and if the mummy lord’s canopic jar is removed from its tomb, it cannot
re-take possession of its body. A mummy lord can only be permanently destroyed if its canopic jar is
destroyed, either before the mummy lord’s body is destroyed or while its disembodied spirit is
within the canopic jar.

As undead, mummy lords are inherently evil for purposes of *discern evil*and *holy circle*spells.
They are rebuked as vampires, but can make a Spells saving throw to resist the effects.

###### Ecology

Mummy lord lairs are typically guarded by lesser undead, including 1d12 mummies and either 4d6
zombies or 3d10 skeletons. Their canopic jars are kept well-hidden and protected by mundane and
magical traps.

A mummy lord has a 10% chance to be infested with 1d10+5 sepulchral worms, or a 90% chance if it
worships Dirgion.

* canopic organs (14 st., 840gp, *death ward, summon insect plague, summon weather, soul swap*)

###### Encounter

A mile wide by 600’ deep gorge cuts through the landscape here. Cut into the east face of the gorge
is an elaborately carved cliff tomb, set about 350’ up from the bottom. In the antechamber, **14
skeletons** with bronze shields and sickle swords wait in wall graves. A tunnel leads from the
antechamber to the main tomb, dominated by an 18’ long, 8’ wide stone sarcophagus in its center,
carved in effigy of Tizar, and bearing cuneiforms detailing his name and achievements. Within is the
ancient sorcerer-king himself, now a mummy lord. Annexed to the main tomb are four servant tombs,
with 4 **mummies** total. The whole area is a **shadowed sinkhole of evil**(see ***ACKS II JJ***,p.
252).

Tizar’s grave goods are kept in a secret vault behind a well-concealed door (-4 to Search throws).
Scattered across the vault are 4,000ep, 4,000gp, and 1,000pp. Amidst the coin is a stoppered clay
pot holding a sweet red fluid (*potion of flight*) and another containing a bone-white fluid
(*potion of cure light injury*). In the corner lies a wooden chest containing a crown of pure gold
inlaid with flawless diamonds (30,000gp); a portrait mask made of gold sheets inlaid with lapis
lazuli (8,000gp); a large wrought gold fan with giant hawk feathers (6,000gp); a dagger of pure
gold, its serpent-shaped grip inlaid with eyes of jacinth (6,000gp); and three rolled papyrus
scrolls, all written in ancient Zaharan (*scroll of magic warding, scroll of undead legion,* and
*scroll of fireball and thunderbolt*). Adjacent to the chest is a tall cedar case with trophies of
Tizar’s many victories: an iron sickle sword graven with Zaharan cuneiforms (*short sword +1*); a
red-bronze Argollëan sword with a pattern that seems to flicker in the light (*sword +1*,
*flamebrand*); a hepatizon kopis inscribed with cuneiforms of anti-magic (*sword +1, +2 v.
spellcasters*); and an orichalcum short sword with an eagle-winged crossguard (*short sword +2*).

**Tizar, Mummy Lord:** Int 17, Cha 16; MV 120’, AC 8, HD 13\*\*\*\*, hp 60, #AT 1 (touch or weapon

The mummy lord’s canopic organs (700gp, 11 4/6 st) are special components, as are his dried skin,
eyes, hands, and wrappings (600gp, 10 st each). Each other mummies’ right hands (260gp, 4 3/6 st
each) and wrappings (200gp, 3 2/6 st each) are also special components, as are the skeletons’ skulls
(13gp, 1/6 st each).
