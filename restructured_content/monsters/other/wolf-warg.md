### Wolf, Warg

Wargs are huge demon-blooded wolves descended from barghests. They are 10’ long and 6’ tall at the
shoulder and weigh as much as 1,050 lbs.

Evil and intelligent, they can speak their own language as well as the language(s) of any local
beastmen. Wargs often fight alongside beastmen, but do not permit themselves to be ridden by
anything less than a great chief or warlord.

###### Combat

Wargs have **acute hearing** and **acute olfaction.** They gain a +2 bonus to avoid surprise in
their natural habitat. They can track the scent of creatures for up to 4 miles with the equivalent
of two ranks of Tracking proficiency.

Like the wolves they were bred from, wargs are more confident when they have greater numbers. If
encountered in or reduced to a pack of 4 or fewer, their morale score is reduced by 1.

###### Ecology

Each warg pack or route will be led by a chief, who fights as a lesser barghest.

When wargs are encountered in their den, the adults will be rearing 1d3 puppies. Roll 1d6 for age;
1-4, they’re juveniles, 5-6 they’re babies. Juveniles have AC 2, Spd 150’, HD 3, and attack with 1
bite (1d6 {P}). Babies have AC 1, Spd 150’, HD 2, and attack with 1 bite (1d2 {P}).

###### Spoils

A slain warg can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the
following components useful in magic research:

* ears (1 st, 60gp, inaudibility, noiselessness)
* fangs (1 1/6 st, 75gp, *bloody flux*)

A warg’s pelt fetches 80gp and weighs 2 4/6 st.

###### Encounter

The ground here is blanketed with a thick layer of bark, leaves, twigs, and other duff. Jutting
from the duff are a number of large boulders, covered in patches of lichen and moss, that form a
rough enclosure. The gaps between the boulders on the ground are filled with nettles, thistles, and
thorny bushes, except for a single 10’ opening. The boulders are crudely roofed on top with
interlocking roots, shrubs, and soil. The interior of the enclosure is covered with soft ferns,
animal hides, and leaves, creating a comfortable bedding for the **warg chief**, **four wargs**, and
**two juvenile warg cubs** that lair here.

**Warg chief**: Spd 180’, AC 5, HD 8+2, hp 43, #AT 1 (bite 2+), Dmg 3d6 {P!}, Save F8, ML +3, XP
1,100; Special: bone-breaking bite

**Wargs (4)**: Spd 180’, AC 4, HD 6, hp 32, 28, 26, 20, #AT 1 (bite 5+), Dmg 3d4 {P}, Save F6, ML
+3, XP 320

**Juvenile warg cubs (2)**: Spd 150’, AC 2, HD 3, hp 15, 12, #AT 1 (bite 8+), Dmg 1d6 {P}, Save F3,
ML +3, XP 50

The wargs have collected trophies of their many hunts, including 30 bundles of common fur pelts
(450gp, 30 st), 2 bundles of rare fur pelts (600gp, 6 st), 16 antler horns (160gp, 16 st), and 24
small roc feathers (240gp, 3 st total).

Cowering in the enclosure is a half-starved half-mad engineer that the wargs have enslaved to use
as their “hands”. He has been taught to speak the Wargish tongue and slavishly obeys the pack chief.
If rescued, his wealthy family would pay 400gp for his return.
