### Genie, Hafar

Genies are sapient humanoids native to the Elemental Spheres with powerful magical abilities. They
are often summoned by mages to render services and sometimes bound in bottles, rings, and other
items.

Genies from the Elemental Sphere of Earth are called hafari. They resemble comely 10’ tall men with
stone-colored skin, iron grey eyes, bald heads, and narrow obsidian-hued beards.

Hafar speak their own language, as well as Ancient Zaharan, Classical Auran, Common, Opelenean, and
Shebatean.

###### Combat

Hafari have several **spell-like abilities**, each of which can be used thrice per day: *create
food, create water, create objects, earth’s movement, earth’s mire (*or *reversed earth’s
hardening), earth’s tremor, invisibility, perpetual figment,* and *wall of stone*. All these
abilities function at caster level 12.

Each use of *create objects* can create up to 10 st of objects worth up to 100gp / st. The
craftsmanship in created objects is equivalent to 3 ranks of Crafting proficiency. An efreet
summoned by ritual magic can create permanent objects, but one summoned by spells can only create
temporary objects. These vanish when *dispelled* or the summoning ends.

As a full-round action, while touching the earth, a hafar can transform into a **rolling boulder**
up to 24’ in diameter. When in boulder form, the hafar can move at a combat speed of 40’ over land
or 20’ burrowing through earth and rock. If the boulder moves into or through one or more creatures
during the move, each such creature must make a size-adjusted Paralysis saving throw. If the save
fails, the creature suffers 2d6 {Se!}damage and is knocked **prone**. If the save succeeds, it
suffers half that damage but is not knocked prone. If the boulder moves into contact with a
structure, it deals 2d6 {Se!}structural damage. The boulder must end its movement when it contacts a
structure or a creature that succeeds on its save. It can revert to its true form at the end of its
initiative if desired.

All hafari are **immune** to mundane damage and seismic damage.

A hafar summoned with ritual magic can be compelled to grant up to 3 *wishes* in lieu of other
services. (No effect short of ritual magic can compel or influence a hafar’s response to a *wish* in
any way.) Hafar despise those who summon them and will attempt to twist the meaning of their orders
and obey them only to the letter.

###### Ecology

In the Elemental Sphere of Earth, the hafari dwell in enormous cities of alabaster and porphyry
that beggar the largest of dwarven vaults. They appear on Aurëpos when called forth by a spell or
edifice of elemental earth.

###### Spoils

A destroyed hafar can be harvested with Alchemy 2 for the following component:
