### Attercop, Monstrous

Monstrous attercops are the first-generation offspring of a demonic attercop and a giant spider of
the mortal sort. A monstrous attercop specimen has a length of around 8’ and a weight of around 500
lbs. Like their progenitors, these arachnid horrors dwell in the fetid swamps, dark forests, and
high mountains of the wild.

Attercops are sapient and speak their own horrific language. Scholars who have studied Ancient
Zaharan, Khepri, and Thrassian find certain similarities in the attercop tongue.

###### Combat

Monstrous attercops are ambush predators, and creatures encountering attercops suffer a -2 penalty
to surprise rolls due to the spiders’ **natural stealth**.

Their bites carry a highly toxic **paralytic venom.** A creature damaged by a monstrous attercop’s
bite must make a Death saving throw at -2. If the save succeeds, the creature is not affected by the
venom. If the save fails, then creature suffers 4d6 {P} damage and becomes **paralyzed** for 2d4
turns at the end of the attercop’s initiative. The paralysis can be cured by *neutralize poison* but
not *cure light injury.* When the paralysis wears off, the poisoned creature is **fatigued**. The
fatigue ends if the poison is neutralized or after the creature enjoys 8 hours of restful sleep.

To aid in ambush, monstrous attercops spin webs in strategic locations around their lairs. They use
these webs to entangle victims in their webs in order to capture them and keep them fresh for later
consumption. They can also spin a web around a target as a melee attack. If a creature moves into an
attercop’s web, or if an attercop succeeds on a webspinning attack throw against a creature, that
creature becomes **webbed.**

The attercop’s **webbed mechanoreception** enables them to “see” any creatures touching their webs.

###### Ecology

Monstrous attercops can reproduce with any other attercops; the mother determines the resultant
offspring. When encountered in a den, there is a 10% chance per monstrous attercop that it will be
guarding a clutch of 2d4 eggs. Monstrous attercop eggs have 1 hp and weigh 1 2/6 st.

###### Spoils

A slain monstrous attercop can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks)
for the following components useful in magic research:

* mandibles (4/6 st, 45gp, *poison*)
* leg tarsus (4/6 st, 45gp, *spider climb*)
* spinneret (1 4/6 st, 100gp, *chameleon, webbing*)

If not used for magic research, a monstrous attercop’s mandibles fetch 12gp and weigh 1/6 st.
