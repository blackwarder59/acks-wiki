### Equine, Donkey

Donkeys are sure-footed, strong, and stoic equines widely used to carry packs or pull vehicles.
They are smarter and tougher than horses and, relative to their weight, considerably stronger.
Donkeys are usually trained as draft animals. They can be trained for riding, but not for war.

Because of their **sure-footedness**, donkeys can be taken into the depths of a dungeon to aid in
transporting equipment or treasure, and their movement multiplier in mountain hexes is x2/3 instead
of x1/2. Donkeys are also **efficient grazers** and can graze for their full day’s rations with
their ancillary activities, enabling them to dedicate their day to travel. They can be used in an
army without a supply cost.

###### Combat

Donkeys are not as skittish as horses (Morale 0) and react differently to fear. Instead of becoming
**frightened** by failed saving throws or morale rolls, a donkey becomes **frozen with fear**. It
remains paralyzed, unwilling to move, until attacked or until the source of fright leaves its sight.

###### Ecology

When a donkey herd is encountered, there is a 50% chance they will be a matriarchal herd with 1d3
juveniles and 1d2 babies. (Otherwise, it’s a bachelor herd.) Juveniles have AC 0, Spd 90’, HD ½, and
1 hoof (1d2 {B}). Babies have AC -1, Spd 90’, 1 hp, ML -4, and do not fight.

Donkeys are bred for strength, speed, and stamina, and finely-bred donkeys often have exceptional
attributes (see “Attributes for Monsters,” on p. XXX). Donkeys with DEX 13+ have their encounter
speed adjusted by 10’ x DEX bonus. Their combat speed adjusted by one-third the encounter speed
adjustment. Their ability to travel long distances quickly is limited by their stamina as well as
speed, so donkeys have their expeditions peed adjusted by the lower of DEX or CON bonus x 2 miles.
Donkeys with STR 13+ have their maximum load adjusted by their STR bonus x 1.5 st.

###### Spoils

A slain donkey with exceptional attributes can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery)
or Trapping for the following component:

* hooves (1/6 st., 10gp, *safe travels, vigor*)

###### Lore

*The bearded donkey stands about 12 hands tall and weighs about 600 lb, with gray dun, brown, red
roan, and sorrel coloration. These donkeys have large heads, robust joints, and big floppy ears.
Their long shaggy coats are often styled around the muzzle in a manner similar to a dwarf’s beard,
hence the name.*
