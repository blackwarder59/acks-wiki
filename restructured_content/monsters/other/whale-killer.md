### Whale, Killer

These immense whales typically reach a length of 25' and weight of 7,700 lbs. They somewhat
resemble dolphin save for their unusual size and black-and-white coloration. They prefer the colder
waters of the north or extreme south, preying on many different sea animals.

###### Combat

Killer whales use **aquatic mechanoreception** to “see” in water up to 600’. Spells or effects that
would ordinarily cause blindness do not affect the whale while it is using aquatic mechanoreception.
However, creatures that are not in the water are invisible to them. Aquatic mechanoreception does
not penetrate structures or terrain features.

While not able to breathe water, killer whales can **hold their breath** for 2 turns (20 minutes).
They are swift swimmers and **prodigious leapers**; a killer whale that charges on its initiative
can jump up to 15’ vertically and horizontally out of the water at any point in its movement.

Killer whales can **swallow whole** creatures of man size or smaller on an unmodified attack throw
of 20. The swallowed creature suffers 3d6 {A!} damage at the starts of its initiative each round and
drowns after 10 rounds. If the swallowed creature has a tiny, small, or natural piercing or slashing
weapon, it can attack the whale from inside its belly with an attack penalty of -4. Should a
swallowed creature die and remain in the whale’s belly for 6 turns, it is irrecoverably digested.
The whale can cleave after swallowing a creature.

###### Ecology

When a pod of killer whales is encountered, there is a 50% chance the adults will be accompanied by
1d3 juveniles and 1d2 babies. Juvenile killer whales are large size, have AC 1, Spd 210’, HD 4+2,
and attack with 1 bite (2d8 {P}). Baby killer whales are man-sized, have AC 0, Spd 180’, HD 3, and
attack with 1 bite (1d8 {P}). Babies and juveniles cannot swallow targets whole.

###### Spoils

Because of their propensity to swallow creatures whole, any encounter with wandering killer whales
might yield treasure. The treasure (if any) is always found inside the whale’s belly.

A slain killer whale can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the
following component useful in magic research:

* air sacs (21 4/6 st., 1,300gp, *capsizing wave, circle of agony, swimming*, armor +1, weapon +2)

A killer whale’s dentition is worth 32gp and weigh 2/6 st.

###### Lore

*Mariners who sail beyond the Narrow Sea come, after a journey of several days, to the jungled
coastline of West Ulruk. If they continue their journey past the Ivory Kingdoms, the jungles give
way to steep mountains with peaks clad in ice and snow. The cold waters at the foot of these
mountains are home to strange creatures unlike any found in the Ammas Aurë. Among these is a fierce
whale, black and white in coloration, which the natives call an* orca*, that is, an “orc of the
ocean.”*

* Toraster the Elder, *Bestiary of Aurëpos*
