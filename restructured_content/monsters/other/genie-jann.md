### Genie, Jann

Genies are sapient humanoids native to the Elemental Spheres with powerful magical abilities. They
are often summoned by mages to render services and sometimes bound in bottles, rings, and other
items.

Genies from the Elemental Sphere of Air are called janni. They resemble 10’6” tall humans of
majestic beauty dressed in resplendent finery. Jann speak their own language, as well as Ancient
Zaharan, Classical Auran, Common, Opelenean, and Shebatean.

###### Combat

Janni have several **spell-like abilities**, each of which can be used thrice per day: *control
wind, create food, create water, create objects, gaseous form, invisibility, perpetual figment, wall
of thunder, and weave smoke*. All these abilities function at caster level 11.

Each use of *create objects* can create up to 10 st of objects worth up to 100gp / st. The
craftsmanship in created objects is equivalent to 3 ranks of Crafting proficiency. An efreet
summoned by ritual magic can create permanent objects, but one summoned by spells can only create
temporary objects. These vanish when *dispelled* or the summoning ends.

As a full-round action, while under open skies, a jann can transform into a **thunderous
whirlwind** standing 70’ tall with a 10’ diameter at its base and 20’ diameter at its apex. When in
whirlwind form, the djinni can move at a combat speed of 40’ over land or water. If the whirlwind
moves into contact with a creature, or a creature moves into contact with the whirlwind, the
creature must make a size-adjusted Paralysis saving throw. If the save fails, the creature takes 2d6
{E!}damage and is **forced back** 10’ and knocked **prone**. If the save succeeds, the creature
takes half that damage but is not forced back. If the whirlwind moves into contact with a structure,
it deals 2d6 {E!} structural damage. The whirlwind can move through creatures without penalty, but
ends its movement if it moves onto a structure. The genie can revert to its true form at the end of
its initiative if desired.

All janni are **immune** to mundane damage and electric damage.

A jann summoned with ritual magic can be compelled to grant up to 3 *wishes* in lieu of other
services*.* (No effect short of ritual magic can compel or influence a jann’s response to a *wish*
in any way.) Janni are more accommodating than other genies and tend not to be malignant while
fulfilling *wishes*.

###### Ecology

In the Elemental Sphere of Air, the janni dwell in aerial palaces that float in the endless sky.
They appear on Aurëpos only when called forth by a spell or aerie of elemental air.

###### Spoils

A destroyed janni can be harvested with Alchemy 2 for the following component:
