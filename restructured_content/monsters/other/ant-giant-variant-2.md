### Ant, Giant Variant 2

### Ant, Giant

Which foul demon or mad sorcerer first bred ants of gigantic size is unknown to even the wisest
sages of Aura, but all agree that it was a terrible mistake. Adaptable, implacable, and omnivorous,
giant ants are a scourge that can reduce a fertile field or woodland to a wasteland in a day.

Like their diminutive cousins, ants are divided into castes of workers, soldiers, and queens.
Workers are about 5' long and weigh about 150 lbs. Soldiers are about 6’ to 7’ long and weigh
approximately 250 lbs. Queens are immense, measuring 7’ to 9’ long and weighing about 400 lbs.

###### Combat

Giant ants are not aggressive unless their nests are invaded. In that case, the ants are
automatically Hostile and gain a +4 bonus to morale rolls provided their queen is still alive.

They use **terrestrial mechanoreception** to sense vibration in the ground over long distances
equivalent to line of sight in full daylight. Spells or effects that would ordinarily cause
blindness do not affect the ant when its using terrestrial mechanoreception. However, creatures that
are flying, levitating, or otherwise not touching the ground are invisible to the sense. Terrestrial
mechanoreception can penetrate structures and terrain features.

###### Ecology

Most giant ants are workers, but for every 5 workers there will be one soldier. When giant ants are
encountered in their nest, there will always be one queen guarded by 2d4 additional soldiers. There
will also be 3d10 larvae and 2d6 eggs. Larva have AC 4, Spd 150’, HD 2, and attack with 1 bite (1d6
{P}). Eggs have 1 hp and weigh 2/6 st. Roll 1d20 per egg: 1 – queen egg, 2-6 soldier egg, 7+, worker
ant egg.

###### Spoils

Giants ants tend to have incidental treasure around their nests, left over from past opponents, but
in some rare instances giant ants will inexplicably mine precious metals. Mining will be evident in
5% of nests, where there will be as much as 1d10x1000 gold pieces worth of raw gold nuggets. At the
Judge’s discretion, a giant ant nest can be treated as a gold vein (see ***By This Axe*** for
details).

A slain worker ant can be harvested with Animal Husbandry 2 for the following components useful in
magic research:

* antennae (4/6 st., 40gp, *locate treasure*)
* chitinous plates (4/6 st., 40gp, armor +1, weapon +1)

A slain soldier can be harvested for components worth and weighing 250% more (1 4/6 st, 100gp). A
slain queen can be harvested for components worth and weighing 400% more (4 st., 160gp).
