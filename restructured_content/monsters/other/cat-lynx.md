### Cat, Lynx

Lynxes are found everywhere in Aurëpos, Danae, Ithea, and Ulruk. Those found in arid climates are
often called caracals or desert lynxes, while those encountered in savanna are often called bush
cats. Whatever their name, they are brown or gray spotted cats with large, tufted ears and
beard-like ruffs under their chins. They measure about 4’ long and weigh about 50 – 60 lbs.

Elusive and cautious, lynxes are only rarely seen by humans or demi-humans.

###### Combat

Lynxes have **acute hearing** and **acute olfaction.** They gain a +2 bonus to avoid surprise in
their natural habitat. They can track the scent of creatures for up to 4 miles with the equivalent
of two ranks of Tracking proficiency.

They are **very agile** (as Acrobatics proficiency at 10+) and **good climbers**, able to ascend
sheer surfaces as if they were thieves (5+). They are also **adept at swimming** (as Swimming
proficiency). Because of their large padded feet, they are **surefooted on snow** and retain their
full speed in Snowy conditions. Their **lightning reflexes** grant a +1 bonus to initiative. They
are **naturally stealthy** when in their native habitat, and creatures encountering them suffer a -2
penalty to surprise rolls.

If a lynx charges a creature or leaps over it (using Acrobatics), and successfully hits it with
both claws, it immediately **pounces** onthe creature. The lynx’s subsequent bite attack
automatically hits and the creature that has been pounced on must make a successful size-adjusted
Paralysis saving throw or be knocked **prone**.

###### Ecology

When lynxes are encountered in a wilderness den, there is a 50% chance the lynxes will be rearing
lynx kittens. Roll 1d6 for age and number: 1-3 it’s 1d2 juvenile cougars, 4-6 it’s 1d4 baby cougars.
Juvenile lynxes have AC 2, Spd 180’, HD 1/2, and attack with a fierce nibble (1 {P}). Baby lynxes
have AC 1, Spd 180’, HD ¼, 1 hp, ML -4, and do not fight.

###### Spoils

A slain lynx with exceptional attributes can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery)
or Trapping for the following component:

* tongue (2/6 st, 21gp, *call of the great cats, silent step*)

A lynx's pelt fetches 16.5gp and weighs 1/6 st.

Because of their small size, lynxes can be trained by domestic animal trainers instead of wild
animal trainers, provided they are caught as babies or juveniles and reared in captivity.

###### Encounter

A collapse of boulders from the higher slopes has created a talus cave on the mountain. Tracks in
the snow leading to and from the cave suggest a number of pawed creatures live within. The talus
cave is the den of a **lynx** and her **3 baby lynx kittens**.
