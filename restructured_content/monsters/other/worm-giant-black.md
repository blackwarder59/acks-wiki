### Worm, Giant Black

Black worms are the largest of the giant worms. These colossal vermin can grow to 100’ in length,
10’ in diameter, and 16,000lbs in weight. The cuticles of their segments are pigmented dark purple
or midnight blue.

###### Combat

The diameter of the black worm’s maw is more than three times the size of a white worm’s. If a
black worm succeeds on a bite attack against a creature of huge size or less with an unmodified
throw of 18 - 20, it can **swallow** the creature. The swallowed creature suffers 3d10 {A!} damage
at the start of its initiative each round. If the swallowed creature has a tiny, small, or natural
piercing or slashing weapon it can attack the worm from inside its belly with an attack penalty of
-4. Should the swallowed creature die and remain in the worm’s belly for 6 turns, it is
irrecoverably digested. The worm can cleave after swallowing a creature.

Perhaps more terrifying than the black worm’s bite is its poison. The pygidium (tail) of the black
worm carries a mass of finger-like cirri (fused cilia) that are coated with **deadly poison**. Any
creature damaged by the cirri must make a Death saving throw. If save fails, the creature dies at
the end of the worm’s initiative.

A black worm can not only can burrow through loose earth, soil, and sand, but can smash through
hard stone, dealing 20 {B!} structural damage per bite. A 30’ long 10’ diameter cylinder of stone
has 200 shp, so it takes a black worm about 1 turn (10 rounds) to advance 30’ through stone.

###### Ecology

When a wilderness nest of giant black worms is encountered, there is a 25% chance per worm that it
will have recently buried 1d6 eggs nearby. The eggs have 3 hp and weigh 12 st. Worm spawn disperse
after birth and are not found in the den.

###### Spoils

A slain black worm can be harvested with Animal Husbandry 2 for the following components useful in
magic research:

* cirri (25 st, 1,500gp, *poison,* weapon +1)
* gizzard (5 st, 300gp, *circle of agony, locate object, locate treasure*)
* mandibles (40 st, 2,400gp, *create chasm, earth's teeth, earth’s movement, passageway*)

If not used for magic research, a black worm’s mandibles fetch 36gp and weigh 4/6 st while its
cirri fetch 12gp and weigh 1/6 st. Its venom (onset time instant, no saving throw modifier, death on
failed Death saving throw) fetches 1,500gp and weighs 1/6 st.
