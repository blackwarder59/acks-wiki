### Lammasu

The lammasu were fashioned from the spirits of heroes and saints by the Empyrean gods to serve Law.
They have the forequarters of lions, the hindquarters of bulls, the wings of giant eagles, and the
faces of men. They measure about 8’ long, weigh 500 lbs, and have wings that span 24’.

Lammasu natively speak the Empyrean tongue of the high gods. Those sent to Aurëpos will also speak
the languages of the region to which they are assigned to provide aid.

###### Combat

If a lammasu observes a chaotic creature attacking a lawful creature, the lammasu automatically
becomes Hostile to the chaotic creature and enters combat against it.

A lammasu can attack with its razor-sharp lion claws for 2d6 {S!} damage. Often, however, it will
employ magic. A lammasu can **cast divine spells** as a 7th-level crusaders. Lammasu are **gifted
healers** and cure twice the normal amount of hit points when casting healing spells.

Lammasu constantly radiate a **perpetual holy circle**in a 10’ radius. In addition to keeping out
enchanted creatures, the holy circle grants twice the AC and saving throw bonus of the normal spell
to creatures in its area (e.g. +2 instead of +1).

By virtue of their divine blessings, lammasu enjoy **magic resistance** to spells and spell-like
effects. When a lammasu is affected by a spell or spell-like effect, it can (but does not have to)
make a magic resistance throw. If the result of the throw equals or exceeds the caster level of the
spell or spell-like effect, the lammasu ignores it.

Lammasu are holy beings that can be detected with *discern good*, held at bay by *unholy circle*
and destroyed with *dispel good.* If summoned, they can be returned to their home sphere by
*counterspell* or *dispel magic*.

###### Ecology

Lammasu can be found roaming throughout Aurëpos in service to Law. Often they serve as guardians of
shrines, temples, or pinnacles of good. They are born only in the Sphere of Empyrean Heaven, to
which their souls return on death.

###### Spoils

A slain lammasu can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the
following components useful in magic research:

* blood (155 st., 9,300gp, *angelic aura, cure injury, healing circle, spirit of healing, sunflare*)
* heart (155 st., 9,300gp, any protection effect)
* wingtips (6 4/6 st., 400gp, *winged flight*)

A lammasu’s 4d12 flight feathers each fetch 2d6gp and weigh 1/12 st.
