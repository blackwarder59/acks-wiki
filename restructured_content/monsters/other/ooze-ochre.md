### Ooze, Ochre

The ochre ooze is a slimy giant amoeba around 20’ in diameter and 10,000 lbs in weight. Its
distinct golden-yellow hue glistens sickeningly in torchlight. Ochre ooze mindlessly slowly oozes
through its environment to consume everything in its path. It can crawl along floors, walls, and
ceilings with equal ease, undulate through water, and can ooze through tiny fissures in stone or
narrow gaps in doorways.

###### Combat

Ochre oozes have **terrestrial mechanoreception** enabling them to sense vibration in the ground
over long distances equivalent to line of sight in full daylight.

An ochre ooze is **immune** to enchantment effects and to acidic, arcane, bludgeoning, electrical,
luminous, necrotic, piercing, poisonous, seismic, and slashing damage. Only cold and fire can truly
harm an ochre ooze, but certain other damage types can affect it temporarily:

* If hit by electrical damage, the ochre ooze will be **paralyzed** for one round per die of damage
the attack would normally deal.
* If hit by seismic damage, the ochre ooze be blown apart and seemingly destroyed, only to reform
unharmed at the start of its next initiative.
* If hit by slashing damage, the ochre ooze will be divided into 1d3+2 smaller oozes. The Judge can
divide the original ooze’s Hit Dice and current hp between the smaller oozes however he sees fit,
with the limitation that no ochre ooze can have fewer than 1 Hit Dice. An ooze with 1 HD only deals
1d3 extraordinary acidic damage, an ooze with 2 HD deals 1d6, and an ooze with 3 – 4 HD deals 2d4.
An ochre ooze of 1 HD treats slashing damage as seismic damage. The ochre oozes can merge back into
one blob as a full-round action. Oozes that merge add their current hp together.

An ochre ooze deals 2d6 {A!} damage and can digest cloth, wood, and leather, but not metal or
stone. Any creature reduced to 0 hp or fewer by an ochre ooze is immediately slain and its body
dissolved.

###### Ecology

Ochre oozes can be found anywhere there is organic matter for them to feed on, but are most common
in stone dungeons, whose confines become their feeding grounds.

An ochre ooze reproduces by budding, detaching a newborn ochre oops (baby) each time it consumes
10,000 lbs of organic matter.

###### Spoils

A destroyed ochre ooze can be harvested with Alchemy for the following component useful in magic
research:

* burnt or frozen remnants (6 1/6 st, 500gp, *illusory duplicates, rain of vitriol, shrinking,
vitriolic infusion, warp wood*)
