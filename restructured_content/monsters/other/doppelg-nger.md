### Doppelgänger

Created by the long-dead and virtually forgotten Khepri before the Day Without Night, doppelgängers
are shapeshifting assassins and spies bred to secretly observe and report on the Khepri’s subjugated
human and demi-human slaves. Millennia have passed since those dark times, but doppelgängers still
live out the purpose bred into their kind, stealing the identities of people best positioned to
observe the activities and conversations of influential humans and demi-humans. They act without
pity or remorse, murdering the people whose identities they steal to minimize the chances that their
ruses will be discovered and even slaying anyone who becomes suspicious of the stolen identity and
begins asking too many questions. Unless discovered, the shifty creatures will continue to steal
more and more identities, creating a never-ending chain of death and deception.

In their rarely-seen natural form, doppelgängers resemble 5’6” tall sickly humanoids with pale
hairless flesh, large bulging yellow eyes with slitted pupils, and horrifying disproportionate
mouths filled with far too many teeth.

Consummate impersonators, each can speak 2d6 languages with native fluency. One language is always
Khepri.

###### Combat

Doppelgängers can **adjust self**at will as a spell-like ability. The effect is identical to that
of the spell, except they can remain in their adjusted forms indefinitely. Their transformations are
so horrific to behold that creatures witnessing one must make Paralysis saving throws. If the save
fails, the creature is **surprised** until the start of his next initiative. If the save succeeds,
the creature can act normally.

A transformed doppelgänger does not radiate under *discern magic, though* its true form will be
apparent to creatures with *true seeing*. They will automatically revert to their natural forms when
slain. Regardless of their current form, doppelgangers are **immune** to enchantment effects and
poisonous damage.

###### Ecology

Doppelgängers are androgynous, and reproduce by breeding with any other humanoid species. When
doppelgängers are encountered in their lair, there is a 10% chance they will be caring for 1d3
children of the local human or demi-human kind. Only a thorough examination by a character with 3
ranks of Healing will reveal the children to be anything but normal specimens of their race.
However, when they enter puberty, the children will awaken to their true nature, acquiring the form,
abilities, and instincts of doppelgängers.

###### Spoils

A slain doppelgänger can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for
the following components useful in magic research:
