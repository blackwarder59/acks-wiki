### Bee, Giant Killer Variant 3

### Bee, Giant Killer

Giant killer bees were first created millennia ago by feeding a queen bee with honey made from
cacodemon ichor. They are highly aggressive social insects that dwell in huge underground hives. The
worker bees are the most commonly encountered, as they will travel as far as 3 miles from their
hives in search of forage. A typical worker bee has a length of 12” and weight of 3 lbs.

###### Combat

Giant killer bees are prone to attack anything they deem a threat, so characters encountering them
out foraging suffer a -4 penalty on their reaction rolls. Characters encountering them near their
hive (within 150’) automatically suffer Hostile reactions and will be pursued for up to 10 rounds.
Giant killer bees never check morale so long as any characters are near the hive.

###### Combat

Giant killer bees are prone to attack anything they deem a threat, so characters encountering them
out foraging suffer a -4 penalty on their reaction rolls. Characters encountering them near their
hive (within 150’) automatically suffer Hostile reactions and will be pursued for up to 10 rounds.
Giant killer bees never check morale so long as any characters are near the hive.

Giant killer bees have **acute olfaction** and gain a +1 bonus to avoid surprise in its natural
habitat. They can “see” by means of **aerial mechanoreception** (60’).

If a worker bee damages a character with its sting attack, it delivers a dose of **deadly poison**
and then pulls away, leaving its stinger lodged in the character. The stung character must make a
Death saving throw. If the save fails, the character dies at the end of the bee’s initiative. Even
if the save succeeds, the stinger deals an additional 1 {P} damage each round at the start of the
character’s initiative until removed. Removing the stinger is a full-round action. The worker bee
itself dies at the end of the round in which it successfully stings.

###### Ecology

Each giant killer bee hive is led by a queen bee (18” long, 8 lbs). The queen’s stinger does not
stay lodged in her targets, so she can sting repeatedly without dying. The queen is always protected
by 10 drones (15” long and 5 lbs). Neither the queen nor the drones will pursue characters outside
of the nest.

Each hive always contains 1d8+1 larvae and 1d4 eggs. Larva have AC 0, Spd 15’, 1 hp, ML -4, and do
not fight. Eggs have 1 hp and weigh 1/100 st.

###### Spoils

Giant killer bee hives contain a special type of honey with healing properties. Eating a pint of
this healing honey (1 item) will cure 1d4 damage. Each hive yields 1d4 pints of healing honey. It
takes one turn to harvest each pint.

A slain giant killer bee can be harvested with Animal Husbandry 2 for the following components
useful in magic research:

* stinger (1/6 st., 6gp, *cure injury* (all)*, neutralize poison, poison*)

If not used for magic research, a giant killer bee’s stinger fetches 3gp. Its venom (onset time 1
turn, +2 saving modifier, 1d4 {Po} damage on failed Death saving throw) fetches 75gp and weighs 1/6
st. A bee that has stung has neither!
