### Vampire

The vampire is a powerful undead creature that resembles an ordinary human, typically of noble form
and countenance, albeit with very pale skin, slightly elongated canine teeth, and long sharp nails.

###### Combat

Predators by nature, vampires possess **acute hearing** and **acute olfaction** that grants them a
+2 bonus to avoid surprise.

Vampires are notorious for their **hypnotic gaze.**  A vampire can use its combat action to
hypnotize a humanoid creature within 60’ which is beholding the vampire. When targeted, the creature
must make a Spells saving throw at -2. If the save succeeds, the creature is not affected. If the
save fails, the creature is **enslaved** until either the vampire releases the creature from its
control, the vampire is destroyed, or the effect is **dispelled** by *dispel magic* or
*counterspell*. The vampire can release an enslaved creature from its control at any time without
expending an action. A vampire can maintain control over no more than one enslaved creature per HD.

A vampire is **preternaturally strong**. It can attack with a weapon, dealing extraordinary damage
with double the weapon’s ordinary damage dice, or it can claw with a long-nailed hand for 1d10 {S!}
damage. If the vampire hits a creature with its claw, it automatically **grabs** the creature struck
unless it succeeds on a Paralysis saving throw.

As a full-round action, a vampire can bite an **enslaved**, **grabbed** or **helpless** creature.
The bite automatically hits, dealing 1d4 {N!} damage and draining 3 points of CON from the creature.
Should a creature be drained to CON 2 or less by a vampire’s bite, it collapses into
unconsciousness. If reduced to CON 0 or less, it immediately dies. Blood-drained creatures regain 1
point of CON per day of rest. The vampire can continue drinking its blood each round thereafter
until the target stops being enslaved, grabbed, or helpless. A vampire’s bite does not awaken a
sleeping target. A vampire must drain at least its HD in points of CON per month from victims, or it
loses 1 HD (to a minimum of 1 HD). It can recover HD by feeding to excess (e.g. at least its HD in
additional points of CON.)

A vampire can assume **gaseous form** or **skinchange** into either a dire wolf or a giant bat at
will as a spell-like ability. When skinchanged, the vampire gains the AC, movement rate, attacks,
and damage characteristics of its new form, but retains its own HD and hit points. A skinchanged
vampire cannot use its other special abilities.

If threatened, it can **call the creatures of the night** once per day as a spell-like ability.
1d10 bat swarms or rat swarms will come to its aid if underground, or 3d6 wolves or 2d4 dire wolves
if above ground. In either case, the creatures called will arrive in 2d6 rounds. The creatures
called will have morale scores of +4 and be completely obedient to the vampire.

Despite – or perhaps because of – their terrible connection to the powers of darkness, vampires can
be strongly affected by a lawful holy symbol, a mirror, and/or garlic. The effects are as follows:

* Any character with a WIS of 13 or more can use a holy symbol to turn a vampire as an action in
lieu of attacking. The attempt should be resolved as if the character were a crusader four levels of
experience below his own class level.
* Any character may use an action in lieu of attacking to present a mirror to the vampire. Being
presented with a mirror forces a vampire to avert its gaze on its next initiative. A vampire that is
averting its gaze cannot use its hypnotic gaze.
* A character carrying garlic will be avoided by the vampire. He will not be attacked if another
suitable target is available. If a character carrying garlic is the only available target, the
vampire can attack him, but suffers a -2 penalty to its attack throw. A vampire will not grab or
bite a character carrying garlic. Note that the character must be carrying the garlic in his hand or
wearing it as a necklace; garlic in a backpack or sack is of no help.

A vampire is **immune** to enchantment effects, necrotic damage, poisonous damage, and all mundane
damage. In addition, it is **resistant** to cold and electrical damage. If it is damaged, a vampire
can only regain hit points by **slumbering** in a coffin containing mementos from its prior life.
After each hour of rest, the vampire will recover 1/8 of its maximum hp. A vampire will typically
maintain several coffins in secret locations to which it can retreat in safety.

A vampire that is reduced to zero or less hit points is not killed, but is instead instantly forced
into its gaseous form. Thereafter further damage has no effect on the vampire, but the vampire can
take no action except to move towards one of its coffins. Once it returns to its coffin, the vampire
will reform into a corporeal body and then awaken with full hit points after 8 hours. There are only
a few means by which a vampire can be truly destroyed:

* If forced into *gaseous form* and thereafter unable to reach one of its coffins, a vampire will
lose 1 HD per month, fading into oblivion when it loses its last HD.
* If exposed to direct sunlight, a vampire must make a Death saving throw on its initiative each
round, turning to dust if the save fails.
* If staked through the heart and then decapitated, a vampire will be irrevocably slain.

In order to stake or decapitate a vampire, the vampire must be helpless and the attacker must be
unengaged by any other enemies and engaged with the vampire.

Staking a vampire is an action in lieu of attacking that instantly **paralyzes** the vampire and
prevents it from escaping with *gaseous form* or *skinchange*.

Decapitating a vampire is an action in lieu of attacking that instantly reduces the vampire to 0
hp. Only the combination of staking and decapitation kills a vampire.

A vampire that is staked without then being decapitated is simply paralyzed and can be freed by
removing the stake. A vampire that is decapitated without first being staked just transforms into
*gaseous form*.

Vampires can, of course, be rebuked as vampires. However, if the result of a rebuke against a
vampire is a “D”, it is only reduced to 0 hp, not killed.

Vampires who were Zaharans or other creatures with the After the Flesh class power will possess the
proficiencies and special abilities they had in life – usually crusaders, fighters, mages,
priestesses, or ruinguards of 9th level or higher. Such vampires can make Spells saving throws to
resist turning, with a successful save meaning the rebuke attempt fails.

A character slain by a vampire’s bite attack will return from death in three days as an undead
creature. If the slain character had 9 HD or more, he will return as a vampire with the HD it
possessed in life. If the slain character had less than 9 HD, he will return as a vampire thrall
(see below).

In either case, the newborn undead will be **enslaved** to the vampire that created him, becoming
free willed only if his master is killed or has too many thralls to control. Once a character
becomes a vampire, he can thereafter advance in HD as a vampire, retaining any class powers as well
if his class or race includes the After the Flesh power.

###### Ecology

When one or more vampire are encountered in a lair, each vampire will be accompanied by 1d3 vampire
thralls of 1d4+4 HD each; 1d6 vampire thralls of 1d4 HD each; and 2d6 enslaved human, demi-human, or
humanoid servants of 1d3 HD each.

The enslaved servants might be used as guards, daytime servants and emissaries, and/or food. The
Treasure Type for vampire excludes the treasure from the thralls, which should be rolled separately
(see below).

###### Spoils

A destroyed vampire can be harvested with Healing 2 for the following components useful in magic
research:

* blood (12 2/6 st., 740gp, *death ward, necromantic potence, withering touch, torpor*)
* eyes (12 2/6 st., 740gp, *bewitch humanoid, call of the wolf, dominate humanoid, enslave
humanoid*)
* fangs (12 2/6 st., 740gp, *inspire horror, necromantic invulnerability*)
* impaled heart (12 2/6 st., 740gp, *gaseous form, torpor*)
* unburnt skin (12 2/6 st., 740gp, *deflect ordinary weapons, energy invulnerability (cold,
electric), skinchange*)
