### Toad, Giant

These immense toads can grow to be as large as a wolf and weigh up to 250lb. They are frequently
encountered in dark forests and swamps and dank, wet dungeons.

###### Combat

Giant toads possess an **aquatic mechanoreception** that enables them to “see” in water up to 120’
by sensing changes in water current and water pressure. Spells or effects that would ordinarily
cause blindness do not affect the toad while it is using aquatic mechanoreception. However,
creatures that are not in the water are invisible to them. Aquatic mechanoreception does not
penetrate structures or terrain features.

Due to their ability to alter the color of their warty hides, giant toads are **naturally
stealthy**. Characters giant toads suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls.

Giant toads use their long, sticky tongues to attack creatures up to 15' away. If a toad succeeds
on a tongue attack against a small creature, it can immediately **yank** the creature adjacent to
itself and make a bite attack against it. However, the giant toad cannot cleave with its bite on any
round when it makes a tongue attack.

If a giant toad succeeds on a bite attack against a small creature with an unmodified throw of 20,
it can **swallow** the creature (p. XX). The swallowed creature suffers 1d4 {A} damage at the start
of its initiative each round until either the toad is killed or the creature dies. The toad can
cleave after swallowing a creature.

###### Ecology

Giant toads do not care for their young and often feed on them when other food sources aren’t
available. When encountered in their lair, there will be a spawning pool somewhere nearby with 1d6 x
100 giant 5”-long tadpoles. Giant tadpoles have AC 0, Spd 60’, 1 hp, ML -4, and do not fight.
Juvenile giant toads are indistinguishable from normal toads and are not usually discovered by
adventurers.

###### Spoils

Because of their propensity to swallow creatures whole, any encounter with giant toads might yield
treasure. The treasure (if any) is always found inside the creature’s belly.

A slain giant toad can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the
following components useful in magic research:

* tongue (3/6 st, 35gp, circle of agony, telekinesis, tongues)
* warts (2/6 st, 15gp, *chameleon*)

The amphibian behemoths are as unpleasant as they are stupid, and are rarely trained.
