### Haugbui

Risen from those slain by a draugr in its barrow, haugbui are silent, decaying corpses that
somewhat resemble zombies and might be mistaken for them at first glance – with potentially
disastrous results. The speed with which they move, and their gnarled, claw-like hands, give them
away for what they truly are. Like their draugr masters, haugbui crave fresh flesh, and devour it
greedily when opportunity permits.

###### Combat

Haugbui normally attack twice per round with their vicious claws, dealing 1d8 [S!] damage each.

Sometimes their draugr masters will equip them with weapons and shields buried in their barrow.
When so equipped, they have AC 5 and one attack per round, dealing damage by weapon +2.

As undead, haugbui are immune to enchantment effects, necrotic damage, and poisonous damage. They
are inherently evil for purposes of spells such as *discern evil*and *holy circle*. They are rebuked
as wights.

###### Ecology

Fortunately for all living creatures, haugbui are unable to leave the barrows they arose in, and
while the death of their draugr master frees them from its command, they then become little more
than thoughtless predators, ready to savagely attack and feast upon any trespassers into their
barrow home.

###### Spoils

A destroyed haugbui can be harvested with Healing 2 for the following components useful in magic
research:

* claw-like hands (5/6 st., 50gp, *swift sword, undead legion*)
* skin (1/6 st., 15gp, *deathless minion*)

###### Encounter

Dozens of small, heavily weathered rune-stones mark an ancient burial field, 25’ feet wide and 70’
long. The stones are scribed with the names of fallen warriors from the Empyrean War. **Four
haugbui** wearing the last tatters of ancient armor, prowl the burial field seeking the battlefield
victory that eluded them in life.
