### Swarm, Insect

An insect swarm is a large mass of small insects, such as bees, ants, wasps, spiders, and other
small biting and stinging bugs that crawl or fly. An insect swarm might be roused if its nest or
feeding ground is invaded, if it is presented with strange smells or bright lights, or if summoned
by magic.

###### Combat

An insect swarm spreads over an area of 100 square feet per HD. A 2 HD swarm is usually 20’ x 10’,
a 3 HD swarm is 20’ x 15’, and a 4 HD swarm is 20’ x 20’. However it can expand or shrink by 50% in
either direction as conditions merit.

Insect swarms do not so much attack as simply engulf everything in their path. Any creature that
starts its initiative in the swarm’s volume, or enters the swarm on its initiative, is **engulfed.**

A creature engulfed by an insect swarm suffers 2 {P} damage or 4 {P} damage if the engulfed
creature is unarmored and has a natural AC of 3 or less. The damage is dealt to the engulfed
creature at the end of its initiative. If, on its initiative, the engulfed creature uses its
movement action to flee from the swarm at least 20’, or uses its combat action to ward off the swarm
with a torch or weapon, it reduces the damage it suffers from the swarm by half. Warding off an
insect swarm with a torch also deals 1d4 fire damage to the swarm.

The engulfed condition ends when the creature starts its initiative outside the area of the swarm.
When the engulfed condition ends, the creature becomes **vexed** by bites from lingering insects. A
vexed creature suffers 1 piercing damage, or 2 piercing damage if it is unarmored and has a natural
AC of 3 or less, at the end of its initiative each round. The vexed condition ends immediately if
the creature becomes engulfed or submerges itself in a body of water. Otherwise it ends after 3
rounds.

Characters damaged by an insect swarm have a 5% chance of becoming infected with a disease. The
Judge should roll 1d100 on the Disease table (p. XX) to determine the disease and its effects. *Cure
disease* is, of course, effective in eliminating this illness.

Insect swarms are **immune** to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.

###### Ecology

Insects are found everywhere and so are insect swarms. The specific type of insect can vary
depending on the terrain and circumstances of the encounter.

###### Spoils

Insect swarms do not yield any spoils except shellmeat.
