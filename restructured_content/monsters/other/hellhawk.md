### Hellhawk

The monstrous hellhawk measures 25’ long from head to tail and weighs 1,500 lbs. Its wings,
bat-like, with tough and leathery skin stretched between their bones, have a span of 45’. They were
crossbred from cacodemons and wyverns by the ancient Zaharans as mounts for their elite ruinguards.
Zahar is now a distant memory, but the soul of every hellhawk remains bound by the ancient pacts of
their former masters.

Hellhawks are semi-sapient. Although incapable of true speech, they can communicate with body
posture and vocalizations.

###### Combat

A hellhawk carries the **stench of rotting carrion**, its body so foul that its very life-blood
pollutes and destroys the soil. Living creatures that begin their initiative, or move on their
initiative to, within 20’ of a hell-hawk must make a Death saving throw become **queasy** from its
overwhelming stench. The condition lasts for 1d4+4 rounds after the character leaves the hell-hawk’s
vicinity. Zaharans are immune to the stench.

Once per hour, a hellhawk can utter a **despairing cry** that inflicts dread and horror on all
lawful creatures within earshot (60’ in normal environments). Each creature must make a Paralysis
saving throw. The effects depend on the intelligence and power of the creature and the result of
their saving throw.

If the save succeeds, creatures with less than 2 HD start **faltering**, while creatures with 2 or
more HD are unaffected. A creature that has already faltered becomes **paralyzed** with dread if
further affected. The faltered condition ends if removed magically or if the hell hawk is destroyed
or goes out of sight.

If the save fails, creatures with less than 2 HD drop their weapons and become **paralyzed** with
dread, while creatures with 2 HD or more are **paralyzed** with dread until the hell hawk attacks.
The paralyzed condition ends if removed magically or if the hellhawk is destroyed or goes out of
sight. If a creature’s condition ends because the hell hawk goes out of sight, it must make a new
saving throw against the effect when the hell hawk returns to sight. (Once a creature succeeded on
its saving throw, it does not need to save again when facing that hell hawk.)

###### Ecology

When an aerie of hellhawks is encountered, there is a 25% probability that each hawk is guarding
offspring. Roll 1d4 for number and age: 1-2, 1d6 eggs, 3-4 1d3 juveniles. Juvenile hellhawks have AC
4, Spd 210’, 3+3 HD, and attack with 2 talons (1d2 {S}) and 1 bite (1d8 {P}). Hellhawk eggs have 1
hp and weigh 1 st. Hellhawks fight to the death to defend their aerie.

###### Spoils

A slain hellhawk can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the
following components useful in magic research:
