### Faerie, Pixie

Pixies resemble elves, save for their diminutive size (2’ tall) and insect- like wings. Like elves
and unlike many other faeries, pixies come in two sexes, male and female, though both sexes have
gracile forms and high piping voices.

Like other faeries, pixies are found primarily in northern Aurëpos, particularly in Northern
Argollë, Jutland, and Rorn. Though some dwell in Southern Argollë, they are otherwise very rare in
the south, where nymphs predominate.

Pixies speak the lilting language of faeries and the languages spoken by the elves and humans of
their region.

###### Combat

While pixies can fly, they have **weak wings.** A pixie can only fly for 3 turns before needing to
land and rest its wings for 1 turn.

Pixies are naturally **invisible**, but can choose to become visible at will. Pixie invisibility is
unlike the spell of the same name in that a pixie can act freely, including attacking, without
becoming visible. However, the spell *discern invisibility* will reveal its presence.

They arm themselves with tiny bows that fire dart-sized arrows and with tiny swords the size of
daggers. They prefer to attack by aerial ambush with their bows. They are **precise shots** capable
of firing even into the chaos of melee.

###### Ecology

Pixies dwell in treetop fastnesses similar to wood elves – but their fastnesses are always
curiously “off,” as if they were built in imitation of elven architecture but without an
understanding of their function. They often feature miniature staircases, for instance, even though
pixies can fly.

They reproduce by breathing life into elven infants who have died of illness or infection. When an
elven child dies it is a tragedy, but if the child’s body vanishes soon thereafter, the parents can
stop grieving, knowing their child will live on as a pixie. The children remember their old life
dimly as if a dream, which fades with time. The transformations require complex magic rituals
performed in places of power on holy days.

###### Spoils

A slain pixie can be harvested with Healing 1 for the following component:

* pixie dust (1/6 st, 16gp, *invisibility, shrinking, winged flight*)
