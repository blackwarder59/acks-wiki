### Bear, Cave

These immense bears stand up to 10' tall and weigh 1,100 lbs or more. They live in caves and
caverns throughout the slopes of the Jutting and Meniri Mountains.

###### Combat

Cave bears particularly savor the taste of human and demi-human flesh. Humans and demi-humans
suffer a -2 reaction roll penalty when encountering them.

The fierce beasts have **acute olfaction** and gain a +1 bonus to avoid surprise in their natural
habitat. They can track the scent of creatures for up to 6 miles with the equivalent of three ranks
of Tracking proficiency. As **cave dwellers**, they rarely get lost navigate lightless caverns
(Caving proficiency). Like other bears, they are **skilled climbers**, able to ascend sheer surfaces
as if they were thieves (6+).

If a cave bear successfully attacks the same target with both claws in the same attack routine, it
immediately **hugs** the target for an additional 2d8 {B}damage. If the hug kills the target, the
bear can cleave with its claw.

###### Ecology

When cave bears are encountered in a wilderness den, there is a 66% chance the adults will be
rearing bear cubs. Roll 1d4 for their age; 1-2, it’s 1d2+1 babies, 3-4 it’s 1d3-1 juveniles.
Juvenile cave bears have AC 1, Spd 90’, HD 3, and attack with two claws (1d2 {S}) and bite (1d4
{P}). Baby cave bears have AC 0, Spd 90’, HD 2, and attack with two scritches (1 {S}) and one nibble
(1d2 {P}).

###### Spoils

A slain cave bear with exceptional attributes can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor
(Butchery) or Trapping for the following components useful in magic research:

* claws (2 4/6 st, 160gp, *iron maiden, swift sword*)
* stomach (2 4/6 st, 160gp, *call of the wild bear, locate animal or plant, slumber*)

A cave bears's pelt fetches 160gp and weighs 3 st.

Cave bears are rather more difficult to train than their smaller cousins.

###### Encounter

A talus cave, some 8’ high and 9’ wide and deep, has formed between boulders piled up on the slope
of a rocky, 60’ high, 900’ wide knoll. The cave is the home of a mated **pair of cave bears**, along
with their **three baby cubs**. These beasts are perpetually hungry for meat. They will attack any
intruders who approach the cave, and follow the scent of blood of wounded party members.
