### Bear, Brown

Brown bears are omnivorous apex predators that dwell in the forests of Aurëpos and Danea. They
average 9’ tall and weigh about 800 lbs. They have brown or red fur, which in older individuals
might be silver-tipped. Brown bears are much more aggressive and carnivorous than black bears.

They are revered through the north as spirit animals of great significance, especially by the
berserkers of Jutland. In the Auran Empire itself, they are often used as fighting animals in the
great arenas.

###### Combat

Brown bears have **acute olfaction** and gain a +1 bonus to avoid surprise in their natural
habitat. They can track the scent of creatures for up to 6 miles with the equivalent of three ranks
of Tracking proficiency. They are also **skilled climbers**, able to ascend sheer surfaces as if
they were thieves (6+).

If a brown bear successfully attacks the same target with both claws in the same attack routine, it
immediately **hugs** the target for an additional 2d8 {B}damage. If the hug kills the target, the
bear can cleave with its claw.

###### Ecology

When brown bears are encountered in a wilderness den, there is a 66% chance the adults will be
rearing bear cubs. Roll 1d4 for their age: 1-2 it’s 1d2+1 babies, 3-4 it’s 1d3-1 juveniles.
Juveniles have AC 1, Spd 90’, HD 2+2, and attack with two claws (1d2 {S}) and bite (1d3 {P}). Baby
brown bears have AC 0, Spd 90’, HD 1+2, and attack with two scritches (1 {S}) and one nibble (1
{P}).

###### Spoils

A slain brown bear with exceptional attributes can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor
(Butchery) or Trapping for the following components useful in magic research:

* claws (1 4/6 st, 100gp, *iron maiden, swift sword*)
* stomach (1 4/6 st, 100gp, *call of the wild bear, slumber*)

A brown bear's pelt fetches 75gp and weighs 2 1/6 st.

Dwarven animal trainers delight in training brown bears, which they raise from infancy to be mighty
war mounts.

###### Encounter

A small knoll, about 15’ high, is lushly overgrown with wild shrubs and grasses. Its nearest face
is pierced by a 4’ diameter tunnel that burrows into the knoll. This is the lair of a **brown bear**
of formidable strength and size. The beast has been a man-eater for years, and will charge any
adventurers who turn their backs on its den. Because of the grizzly bear’s extraordinary size, its
pelt is especially valuable (225gp, 2 1/6 st), and its claws and stomach are useful as special
components (100gp, 1 4/6 st each).

Brown bear: Str 16, Con 16; Spd 120’, AC 3, HD 5+10, hp 32, #AT 3 (2 claws/bite 4+), Dmg 1d4+2 {S}
/1d4+2 {S} /1d8+2 {P}, Save F2, ML 0, AL N, XP 200; Special: hug (2d8+4 {B} if both claws strike in
one round)
