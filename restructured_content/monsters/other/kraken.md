### Kraken

Kraken were created by Lammala, the chthonic goddess of the abyssal depths, in time immemorial. The
scourge of the deep, kraken are squid of truly colossal size. Their bodies and mantles reach lengths
of 60’, with their cruelly-barbed tentacles, 2 large and 8 smaller, double this length. They weigh
as much as 10,000 lbs (5 tons).

These monstrous beasts take cephalopod intellect to its animal extreme, and while not fully
sapient, are nonetheless cunning predators, and will freely attack and devour smaller whales,
sharks, giant squids, and other oceanic denizens, as well as boats, sometimes snatching unsuspecting
sailors from atop the decks of their vessels.

Some adventurers claim there are kraken lurking in the oceans that have achieved true sapience and
serve as cephalopodic tyrants over lesser aquatic creatures. The most learned sages of the Tower of
Knowledge consider this unlikely, however.

###### Combat

Krakens have **acute vision** and **acute olfaction** granting them a +2 bonus to avoid surprise in
their native habitat. Their fluid-filled statocysts grant them **aquatic mechanoreception** that
enables them to “see” underwater to a range of 270’ (p. XX).

A kraken can attack from up to 90’ away with its tentacles. A kraken’s large tentacles can attack
vessels or creatures of huge size or larger. Its smaller tentacles can attack vessels or creatures
of any size within reach. As a colossal creature, a kraken deals full structural damage to vessels.

A successful hit with a large tentacle deals 2d20 {B!} damage and **restrains** the creature or
vessel. A successful hit with a small tentacles deals 2d12 {B!} damage and, if it struck a creature,
**restrains** the creature. Small tentacles cannot restrain vessels.

While a creature or vessel is restrained by a large tentacle, the kraken can automatically deal
2d20 {B!} (large tentacle) or 2d12 {B!} (small tentacle) on its initiative each round to the
restrained vessel or creature without having to make an attack throw. Doing so counts as the
kraken’s attack with that tentacle.

A restrained creature cannot move but can still attack, cast spells, take actions in lieu of
attacking, or attempt to escape. A restrained vessel cannot move, ram, or steer, but any crew can
continue to act normally. A creature can escape by breaking free, slipping free, or cutting off the
tentacle, but a vessel can only escape from restraint if the tentacle(s) restraining it are cut off.
The normal rules of the restrained condition (p. XX) otherwise apply.

To cut off a large tentacle, an attack must deal 50 or more slashing damage to it in one blow. To
cut off a small tentacle, an attack must deal 30 or more slashing damage to it in one blow. Any
damage dealt beyond the required amount is not dealt to the kraken (the tentacle was severed).

In addition to attacking with its tentacles, a kraken can also attack with its great beak for 3d20
{P!} damage. If it is restraining a vessel, it can attack the vessel. Otherwise, it can attack a
creature that is within 5’ of its beak.

If a kraken succeeds on a bite attack against a creature of huge size or less with an unmodified
throw of 18 - 20, it can **swallow** the creature. The swallowed creature suffers 3d20 {A!} damage
at the start of its initiative each round and drowns after 10 rounds. If the swallowed creature has
a tiny, small, or natural piercing or slashing weapon, it can attack the kraken from inside its
belly with an attack penalty of -4.

Should a swallowed creature die and remain in the kraken’s belly for 6 turns, it is irrecoverably
digested. The kraken can cleave after swallowing a creature.

Once per day, a kraken can use its combat action to create a 180' radius **cloud of black ink**
around itself. It typically uses this to obscure itself long enough to flee from a losing encounter.
The ink has the effect of a *tenebrosity* spell but it disperses into the water after 1 turn.

###### Ecology

Kraken roam the oceans in search of prey, for their great bulk demands they feed constantly. They
make their lairs in the abyssal depths, often near coral reefs, shipwrecks, or other underwater
structures where they can lurk unseen and, more importantly, deposit their eggs in hidden places.

They reproduce only once in their lifetime and intensively care for their offspring. The female
deposits a gelatinous egg mass in a hidden place, and then stays with the mass until the eggs hatch.
When a kraken is encountered in its lair, there is a 15% chance it will be guarding one egg mass.
Giant kraken egg masses have 5 hp and weigh 25 st.

###### Spoils

Because of their propensity to swallow creatures whole, an encounter with a kraken may yield
treasure even if the creature is encountered outside its lair. Such treasure (if any) is found
inside the creatures’ bellies.

A slain kraken can be harvested with Animal Husbandry or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the
following components useful in magic research:

* beak (66 4/6 st., 4000gp, *circle of agony,* weapon +5)
* ink sac (66 4/6 st., 4000gp, *shrouding fog, tenebrosity*)
* small tentacle (66 4/6 st., 4000gp, *choking grip, sunder structure*)
* large tentacle (70 5/6 st., 4250gp, *cataclysm,* any water elemental effect)

If not used for magic research, a kraken’s beak fetches 60gp and weighs 1 st. A kraken’s ink sac
fetches 3,600gp and weighs 4 st.

###### Encounter

For leagues, the sea has been aquamarine green, the shallow water the color of the sea floor below.
Ahead, however, lies a great disk of midnight blue water, almost 1000’ wide – a giant submarine
sinkhole where the sea floor falls away into a chasm more than 700’ deep.

A successful Loremastery or Knowledge (history) proficiency throw recalls that the *Leontophoros*,
a Nicean royal galley, is reputed to have sunk in a “great blue hole in the sea” in this stretch of
waters.

The treasure-filled wreck of the *Leontophoros* does rest at the floor of the sinkhole, alongside
scores of other shipwrecks. All of these vessels were sunk by the immense **kraken** which lairs on
the bottom of the blue hole. The kraken will attack any ships which sail across the blue hole, or
which linger at its perimeter.

**Kraken:** Con 16; Spd 180’ swim, AC 3, HD 36\*\*, hp 220, #AT 9 (2 large tentacles, 8 small
tentacles, 1 bite -10+), Dmg 2d20 {B!} + restraint / 2d12 {B!} + restraint /3d20 {P!} + swallow
whole, Save F15, ML 0, AL N, XP 18,350; Special: restrain creatures (2d12 ongoing, deal 30hp in one
blow to cut off), restrain ships (2d20 shp ongoing, deal 50 hp in one blow to cut off), swallow
whole (target swallowed if attack throw beats target value by 4+ or on unmodified 20, suffers 3d20
ongoing, may attack from within at -4, drowns in 10 rounds)

If the kraken is slain or driven off, the treasures on the sea-floor can be dredged to the surface.
A large oak treasure chest holds 5,000sp and 2,000gp in algae-covered Nicean coinage. A rusted iron
box contains a pair of carnelians (75gp each), a topaz (500gp), a sunset amethyst (750gp), a pair of
facet-cut star sapphires (6,000gp each), and a trio of flawless facet-cut jacinth stones (8,000gp
each). A toppled cabinet in the *Leontophoros*’ forecastleholds a gold pendant embossed with a
medusa’s head (700gp), an ornate eagle cameo carved of two-layered onyx (1,000gp), an intricately
wrought gold wreath (1,200gp), and a gold diadem studded with diamonds topped with a winged sun of
ruby and platinum (31,000gp). (The remnants of other treasures are visible throughout the wreckage,
but have been irreparably ruined by algae and salt water.) The kraken’s small tentacles (4,000gp, 66
4/6 st), large tentacles (4,250gp, 70 5/6 st), ink sac (4,000gp, 66 4/6 st), and stomach (4,000gp,
66 4/6 st) are valuable as special components.

The blue hole within which the kraken dwells is an *azure well of elemental water.* Spellcasters
who cast water spells here calculate the spell effects as if they were two class levels higher than
their actual level of experience. Characters performing magical research related to water spells in
an azure well gain a +1 bonus to their magic research throws. If the azure wall is unoccupied, there
is a 10% chance every 1d12 days that a water elemental (1 elemental or 1 marid) will manifest there.
