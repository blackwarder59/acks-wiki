### Wight

The chthonic cults hold that a mortal who dies is doomed to oblivion unless he magically binds his
soul to his preserved corpse. But what happens if a devoted servant of the dark gods dies in a
manner that destroys his corpse beyond mortuary repair? In such cases, the soul of the deceased
cultist can be bound into *another* person’s preserved corpse. Such a creation is known as a wight.

A wights has the mind and memories of the evil soul that animates it, but also gains access to the
residual memories of the corpse it inhabits (the same memories accessed by *speak with dead*). With
this foul knowledge, it delights in tormenting those who knew the deceased in life. During the
Empyrean War, the necromancer-priests of Zahar would often purposefully bind a malevolent and
hateful soul into the body of a slain Empyrean hero in order to demoralize their foes. The moral
impact on the rebels of seeing a favored champion return as a wight to fight for the enemy was
devasting.

Wights appear as embalmed corpses decked in the funerary garments and shrouds they were buried in.
Most wear helms or cuirasses buried on their corpse and might carry ancient axes, blades, or spears,
tainted and poisoned with the wight’s bile.

###### Combat

If unarmed, a wight attacks with a **necrotizing** **touch** that deals 1d6 {N!} damage. If armed,
it deals extraordinary damage by weapon +1, causing {N!} damage in addition to the weapon’s normal
damage type. Any living creature damaged by a wight’s attack must make a successful Death saving
throw or start **rotting**. Rotting creatures gradually begin to bruise, bleed from their orifices,
and slough off hair and skin. They take 1 {N!} damage at dusk each day and cannot benefit from
magical healing until the condition ends. Wight rot can be cured with *cure disease* or temporarily
halted with *delay disease*.

Wights are **immune** to enchantment effects, necrotic damage, poisonous damage, and all mundane
damage. However, silver weapons deal extraordinary damage against wights. Wights are inherently evil
for purposes of *discern evil*and *holy circle*spells and are rebuked as wights.

###### Ecology

Since the fall of Zahar, few wights have been deliberately created, though some can still be found
in the ancient tombs and temples that dot the Waste. As the Awakening approaches, however, it is
possible that buried corpses across Aurëpos might be animated as wights by the evil spirits conjured
by that fell occasion.

###### Spoils

A destroyed wight can be harvested with Alchemy 2 for the following component useful in magic
