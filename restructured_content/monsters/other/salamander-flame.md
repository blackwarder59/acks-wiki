### Salamander, Flame

The flame salamander is a kind of intelligent fire elemental. It resembles a giant four-legged
lizard with fire red scales. A typical specimen measures 12' to 16' in length and weighs around
1,300 lbs.

Fire salamanders speak their own tongue, which sounds like fire crackling. They virtually never
speak any other languages. Frost salamanders and flame salamanders despise one another and will
always fight if in the same vicinity.

###### Combat

A flame salamander radiates an **aura of scorching heat** in a 20’ radius**.** Any creature that
begins its initiative in, or moves into, the aura suffers 1d8 {F!} damage and must make a Blast
saving throw. If the save fails, the creature becomes **dehydrated**. If already dehydrated, it
loses 1 CON.

The claws a fire salamander deal 1d6 {F!} {S!} damage, while its bite deals 2d6 extraordinary {F!}
{P!} damage.

Flame salamanders are **immune** to enchantment effects, to fire damage and to mundane bludgeoning,
piercing, and slashing damage. They can be held at bay by *holy circle.* If summoned, they can
bedispelled with *counterspell* or *dispel magic*.

###### Ecology

Flame salamanders are not native to our sphere. They usually arrive in Aurëpos by summoning magic
or through a portal created at a furnace of elemental fire. Once they arrive in our world, flame
salamanders often take up residence in the molten lava of volcanoes or other very hot and arid
regions.

###### Spoils

A slain flame salamander can be harvested with Alchemy 2 for the following component useful in
magic research:

* red ichor (18 2/6 st, 1,100gp, *bane-rune, burning sparks, blinding flash, conflagration, deflect
ordinary weapons, energy protection* (fire), *inferno, phoenix aura, wall of flame,* armor +2)

###### Encounter

An 8’ diameter drift (horizontal mining tunnel) has been driven into the hillside here. The
temperature within is quite warm, and the walls of the drift are blackened as if burned. About 40’
in, the drift widens to a 25’ x 40’ chamber, where 15 crates filled with miners’ tools (225gp, 10 st
each) are stacked alongside one wall. Opposite is a large four-wheeled cart, crawling with tiny
black beetles. The beetles are harmless, and conceal a pile of 48 ingots of unrefined gold ore
(300gp, 2 st each). Past the chamber, the drift follows the meandering course of a mined-out vein,
intersected every 100’ by crosscuts connected to vertical ventilation shafts and downward-sloping
drainage adits, eventually terminating after 900’. Those following the vein, or gathering the gold
from the cart, will attract the new denizens of the shaft: **six flame salamanders**.

**Flame salamanders (6):** Spd 120’, AC 7, HD 8\*, hp 40, #AT 3 (2 claws/bite 3+), Dmg 1d4 {F!}{S!}
/1d4 {F!}{S!} / 1d8 {F!}{O!}, Save F8, ML 0, AL N, XP 1,100; Special: aura of heat, immunities
