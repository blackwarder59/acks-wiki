### Siren

Often mistaken for tritones (mermaids), the siren is actually an aquatic relative of the harpy. The
first sirens are reputed to have been born when Nasga, Chthonic goddess of beauty and pain, seduced
Naurivus, Empyrean god of water and weather, into giving her daughters. The creatures have the
faces, breasts, and abdomens of beautiful women, but the tails of sea-fish. They are the same size
and stature as tritones about 6’ tall and weigh 200 lbs.

Sirens typically speak Ancient Zaharan, Common, Triton, and the local dialects of fishermen and
sailors.

###### Combat

As a full-round action, a siren can sing an **enthralling song**.Once begun, the song continues
until the start of the siren’s next initiative or until it is slain. While a siren is singing, each
creature within earshot of it (240’ in normal environments), except another siren, must make a
Spells saving throw at the start of its initiative. If more than one siren is singing, the creature
saves once with a -2 penalty for each additional siren in earshot.

If the saving throw succeeds, the creature gains immunity to the effects of every siren’s
enthralling songs until the start of its next initiative. If the saving throw fails, the creature
becomes **enthralled**. On its initiative, an enthralled creature will move at combat speed towards
the nearest siren that enthralled it. If on a vessel, the creature will dive off the vessel and into
the water, risking Swimming throws as necessary. If actually steering a vessel, the enthralled
creature will steer it towards the sirens, automatically hitting whatever nautical hazard the sirens
live upon!

Once within 5’ of the siren, the creature will remain stationary (if it has a swimming speed) or
start drowning (if not). In any case, the creature cannot take full-round actions, combat actions,
or even speak, and is **vulnerable** to the sirens’ attacks. A creature remains enthralled until the
effect is dispelled, the siren is slain, or 6 turns elapse.

If forced to fight, sirens dive into the water and attack with their natural weapons preferring to
target drowning creatures where possible. Sirens instinctually know how to take advantage of
vulnerable targets (as Ambushing proficiency).

###### Ecology

Sirens always make their homes on nautical hazards such as dangerous rocks or jagged reefs,
favoring those near coasts that enjoy frequent maritime traffic. Roll 1d6 to determine the type of
hazard upon which the sirens have laired: 1-2, rocks; 3, reef; 4, wreck; 5, sandbar; 6 shoal. Since
sirens never swim far from their lairs, the lair roll actually determines whether the siren dwells
alone or dwells in a school with other sirens.

Sirens reproduce through deception. Pretending to be a mermaid, a siren will seduce an eligible
triton into impregnating her and remain with him as his apparent wife until her egg hatches.
Thereafter the siren will disappear, leaving her child to be raised by the tritons. Male hatchlings
develop into ordinary tritons, but female hatchlings develop into sirens, discovering their true
nature in adolescence.
