### Shark, Bull

Bull sharks are brown and grey sharks with broad, flat snouts that give them a blunt appearance.
They typically reach a length of 8’ and weight of 290 lbs. They are found in warm, shallow waters
along coasts and in rivers.

###### Combat

Bull sharks have a lateral line system that affords them **aquatic mechanoreception**. They can
“see” in water up to 180’ by sensing changes in water current and water pressure. They also have
**acute olfaction** granting them a +1 bonus to avoid surprise in their native habitat. They can
sense blood in the water to a range of 300’.

Once they sense blood, bull sharks become **furious feeders** and will fight to the death without
making morale rolls.

###### Ecology

Though bull sharks are not social creatures, they are often found in large groups in feeding
grounds. Bull sharks give birth to live young, but the pups are immediately independent and receive
no parental care.

###### Spoils

A slain bull shark with exceptional attributes can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor
(Butchery) or Trapping for the following component useful in magic research:

* dorsal fin (3/6 st, 29gp, *righteous wrath, swimming,* weapon +1)

###### Lore

*Though to our Auran eyes they seem an unruly rabble, the pirates of the Syrnasos are not entirely
lawless. When a pirate is alleged to have committed a crime, such as showing cowardice before the
enemy, then his captain (for so the chiefs of the Syrnasos style themselves) drags him before the
assembled crew and reads aloud the charges. The defendant is then given leave to rebut the charges
as best he is able. Afterwards, any crew member can speak for or against the defendant. When all the
speakers have finished, the crew by acclamation decides whether the defendant should be convicted.
If, in the captain’s ears, the acclamation is uncertain, he entrusts the decision to Calefa, goddess
of Fortune, by casting a bone marked with faces showing guilt or innocence.*

*If the defendant is convicted, the punishment inflicted on him is governed by custom and
tradition. For cowardice, a convict suffers whipping; for spreading scurrilous rumors, the taking of
his teeth; for falling asleep on watch, the taking of an eye. For higher crimes, a guilty culprit is
executed.*

*The Syrnasans have a most ingenious method of execution which is well-suited to their maritime
culture. First, they slice long cuts into the arms and legs of the convict, so that blood courses
from him freely. Then he is made to walk down a boarding ramp until he stands over open sea. The
ramp is then shaken, such that the hapless convict falls into the water. There, the churning of his
bloody limbs soon attracts shivers of sharks, who make short work of the knave.*
