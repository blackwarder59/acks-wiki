### Faravahar

Faravahar are ancient creatures whom sages believe led the Empyrean faction in the cosmic war that
ended on the Day Without Night. Some texts imply they have operated as messengers or prophets of the
Empyrean gods in elder ages, and it is believed that those who are truly dedicated to Law will find
them staunch allies and wise counsels.

Depicted in ancient artwork as winged wise men, Faravahar are actually avian humanoids with owlish
heads with colored feathers about the head and neck that give the impression of beards. An adult
faravahar stand about 8’6” tall and weigh about 410 lbs. Faravahar coloring tends to bronze and
gunmetal; rarely intruding into copper and silver, sometimes dyed into jewel tones. Their hind legs
end in six talons, strong enough to clutch to sheer surfaces but nimble enough to wield tools and
weapons. Their forearms and hands are dexterous but slender, used for delicate work.

Faravahar speak their own ancient tongue, which resembles Proto-Danean, as well as Argollëan,
Classical Auran, and Common.

###### Combat

Faravahar have **acute vision** and gain a +1 bonus to avoid surprise in their natural habitat.
They can **cast arcane and divine spells** as Nobiran Wonderworkers of their HD. Blessed with
**divine health**, they are immune to diseases, including magic diseases.

Because their forearms cannot wield weapons, faravahar prefer to fight from the air, attacking with
their talons in melee, using their talons to fire crossbows at range, or blasting their foes with
spells. Faravahar can remain stationary (hover) while flying in order to cast spells.

###### Ecology

Faravahar are today found only in isolated highlands where they can build against sheer cliff sides
or inaccessible mountaintops. They favor open, airy architecture that blends in with the surrounding
area but often set up labyrinthine vertical tunnels for storage or as a defensive measure.

Each faravahar wing will be led by a spara with 9 HD and 54 hp. Each faravahar settlement will be
led by a satrap with 11 HD and 66 hp. Faravahar reproduce rarely, so settlements will have only a
small number of offspring. Roll 1d4: 1, 2d3 faravahar eggs; 2-4, 2d3 juvenile faravahar. Juvenile
faravahar have AC 3, Spd 45’ / 150’, HD 4, and attack with 2 talons (1d8). Eggs have 1 hp and weigh
1/6 st.
