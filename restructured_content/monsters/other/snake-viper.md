### Snake, Viper

Pit vipers are 4’ - 5’ long gray-green snakes renowned for their swift strikes and deadly venom.
They are native to Shebatea, Somirea, Kemesh, Opelenea, Tirenea, and Nicea, and sometimes found in
Krysea and Southern Argollë. In the Sunset Kingdoms, vipers are revered as symbols of the Chthonic
gods, but in the Auran Empire they are seen as sinister and evil creatures to be killed on sight

###### Combat

Pit vipers have **acute olfaction** that grants them a +1 bonus to avoid surprise in their natural
habitat.

Renowned for their speed, vipers have **lightning reflexes** that grant a +2 bonus to initiative.
Any creature damaged by a pit viper’s bite must make a Death saving throw. If the save fails, the
creature dies of **poison** 1d4+2 turns later.

###### Ecology

While pit vipers sometimes congregate in dens during brumation or breeding season, they do not
exhibit any parental care for their offspring. Their young are born fully formed with functional
venom glands. The precocious snakelets quickly disperse after birth.

###### Spoils

A slain pit viper with exceptional attributes can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor
(Butchery) or Trapping for the following components useful in magic research:

* fangs (2/6 st., 18gp, *poison, swift sword*)
* tongue (2/6 st., 20gp, *snakes to staffs, staffs to snakes*)

If not used for magic research, a viper’s fangs fetch 4gp and weigh 1/6 st. Its venom (onset time
1d10 turns, +2 saving modifier, 2d6 {Po} damage on failed Death saving throw) fetches 125gp and
weighs 1/6 st.

###### Encounter

A natural hollow has formed at the base of a towering tree, its roots twisted and turned over
centuries to form a series of small caves and crevices below the trunk. The hollow is the nest of
**four vipers**.

**Vipers (4):** Spd 90’, AC 3, HD 2\*, hp 14, 11, 7, 6, #AT 1 (bite 9+), Dmg 1d4 {P} + poison, Save
