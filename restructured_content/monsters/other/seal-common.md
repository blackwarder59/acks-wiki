### Seal, Common

Common seals are aquatic mammals around 8’ in length and 750 lbs in weight. They are found
throughout the coastal waters of the Ammas Aurë. They rarely stray into deep water, preferring to
stay by beaches where they can congregate, give birth, and take refuge from predators. However, they
are shy creatures and if the shorelines become built up, they will abandon the beaches in favor of
undersea caves remote from human and demi-human activity.

###### Combat

Seals have exceptionally sensitive whiskers that can detect vibrations in the water. These whiskers
grant them **aquatic mechanoreception** to 240’. Spells or effects that would ordinarily cause
blindness do not affect the seal while it is using aquatic mechanoreception. However, creatures that
are not in the water are invisible to them. Aquatic mechanoreception does not penetrate structures
or terrain features.

Seals are agile and intelligent. They know how to **take refu**ge from aquatic predators by
beaching onto the shore and from terrestrial predators by diving into the water. If a seal is
attacked in water within 150’ of shore, of attacked on land within 30’ of water, it can withdraw or
retreat to the other environment.

When hunting, or forced to fight, seals attack with their bite for 2d4 {P} damage. If a seal
damages a tiny or small target with its bite, it can **violently shake and toss** the target,
inflicting an additional 2d4 {Se} damage.

###### Ecology

When a congregation of seals is encountered, the adults will be accompanied by 1d8 juvenile seals
and 1d6 baby seals. Juvenile seals have Spd 20’ / 120’ swim, AC 1, HD 1, and attack with a bite (1d3
{P}). Baby seals have Spd 20’ / 120’ swim, AC 0, HD 1-1, and attack with a nibble (1 {P}).

###### Spoils

A slain seal with extraordinary characteristics can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor
(Butchery) or Trapping for the following component useful in magic research:

* blubber (2/6 st., 20gp, *protection from temperature, swimming*)

Unlike most animals, the pelts of babies and juveniles are as or more valuable as the pelts of
adults. A baby seal’s pelt fetches 16.5gp and weighs 1/6 st. A juvenile seal’s pelt fetches 25gp and
weighs 2/6 st. An adult seal’s pelt fetches 110gp and weighs 2 st.
