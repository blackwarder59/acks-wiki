### Goo, Grey

The horrific grey goo can grow to a diameter of up to 10’ with a thickness of about 6”. Mindless
and implacable, grey goo slowly oozes through its environment to consume everything in its path. It
can move along floors, walls, and ceilings with equal ease, undulate through water, and can ooze
through tiny fissures in stone or narrow gaps in doorways.

###### Combat

Grey goo resembles damp stone so closely that it can be mistaken for that easily, giving it
**natural stealth** when in dungeons. Creatures encountering grey goo suffer a -2 penalty to
surprise rolls. It possesses **terrestrial mechanoreception** enabling it to sense vibration in the
ground over long distances equivalent to line of sight in full daylight.

In combat, grey goo strikes like a snake, slamming opponents with its body. The effects of a
successful slam depend on whether the target is armored:

* A successful slam on an unarmored being deals 2d8 {A!} damage to the creature. Any non-magical
clothing is destroyed immediately as the acid eats through it viciously. Magical clothing is
destroyed unless it succeeds on a Death save (use the wearer’s target value, adding any magic bonus
if applicable).
* A successful slam on an armored being immediately destroys any non-magical armor. Magical armor
is destroyed unless it succeeds on a Death save (as above).

If grey goo hits a creature with its slam, the goo **clings** to the creature in order to dissolve
it. The goo can use its combat action to automatically deal another 2d8 {A!} damage to the creature
each round. The creature to which the goo is clinging can still move, but count as carrying an extra
300 st. of encumbrance. (Most creatures won’t be able to move!) The goo moves with the creature it
is latched onto. A grey goo will continue clinging to a creature until the creature dies or the goo
is destroyed. Any creature reduced to 0 hp or fewer is immediately slain and its body consumed.

Grey goo is **immune** to enchantment effects and to acidic, arcane, cold, fire, luminous,
necrotic, poisonous, and seismic damage. It has no resistance to electrical damage or to
bludgeoning, slashing, or piercing damage. However, a non-magical weapon that strikes grey goo
dissolves immediately after dealing its damage. A magical weapon dissolves unless it succeeds on a
Death save (as above).

###### Ecology

Grey goo is found in dank caves and dungeons where it serves as a decomposer that eliminates
organic material. It feeds on plants, animals, and metals, including weapons and armor, but does not
digest stone.

A grey goo reproduces by budding, detaching a newborn grey gunk (baby) each time it consumes
3,100lbs of bone, flesh, or metal.
