### Beastman, Orc

Orcs are grotesque beastmen bred as warriors from men and wild boars by the ancient Zaharans. They
stand just over 6’ tall and weigh around 200 lbs, with pig-like faces, reddish eyes, black hair, and
ochre to olive skin. Orcs prefer wearing vivid colors that many humans would consider unpleasant,
such as blood red, mustard yellow, yellow-green, and deep purple. Orcs are exceedingly cruel, even
by beastman standards, and delight in the torment and murder of others. They are also exceptionally
greedy, which makes them particularly attractive to the chaotic rulers who hire orcs as mercenary
soldiers.

###### Combat

Unless special troops are present (p. XX), 50% of gangs or warbands encountered will be archers
(round up), 50% will be warriors (round down). Most orc warriors are equipped with leather armor,
spear, short sword, and shield. Some orc tribes field warriors equipped with scale armor and pole
arm. Most orc archers are equipped with scale armor, short bows, 20 arrows, and short sword. Some
orc tribes field crossbowmen in lieu of archers, equipped with scale armor, crossbow, 20 bolts, and
short sword.

###### Ecology

Each orc gang will be led by a champion with 4 AC, 1+1 HD, 8 hp, and a +1 damage bonus. Each orc
warband will be led by a sub-chieftain with 5 AC, 2 HD, 12 hp, and a +1 damage bonus. An orc lair or
village will be led by a chieftain with 6 AC, 4 HD, 20 hp, and a +2 damage bonus. As long as the
chieftain is alive, the orcs will gain a +2 bonus to morale rolls.

Orc lairs and villages will have drudges and whelps equal to 100% and 200% of the number of
warriors respectively. Orc drudges fight as kobolds. Orc whelps have Spd 90’, AC 0, 1 hp, ML -4, and
do not fight.

When orcs are encountered in a village, certain additional creatures will be present. There is a
50% chance an orc village will be guarded by 1d4+1 ogres and a 60% chance it will be guarded by 2d4
giant boars. There is a 50% chance for 1d10 enslaved captives per warband. In addition, an orc
village has a 75% chance of a shaman being present, and a 50% chance of a witch doctor. A shaman is
equivalent to a sub-chieftain statistically, but has Shaman abilities at level 1d6. A witch doctor
is equivalent to a champion statistically, but has Mage abilities at level 1d4.
