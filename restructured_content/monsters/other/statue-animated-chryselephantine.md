### Statue, Animated Chryselephantine

Statues of various materials can be made into constructs by powerful spellcasters. Those made of
chryselephantine are usually sculpted to resemble gods, titans, and heroes with larger-than-life
statures standing 8’ to 10’ in height and weighing 900 lbs. They are built with wooden frames that
are set with thin slabs of ivory (to represent flesh) and sheets of gold leaf (to represent armor,
hair, and garments).

###### Combat

Unless they engage in some form of movement, animated chryselephantine statues appear to be normal
statues even upon close inspection. Characters encountering stationary animated statues suffer a -2
penalty to surprise rolls.

A chryselephantine statue attacks by hurling **bolts of lightning** that can strike a single target
within 240’ for 3d10 {E!} damage.

In lieu of hurling lightning a chryselephantine animated statue may utter a **thundering threat**.
The exact phrasing of the threat is defined by the statue’s creator, e.g. “death to those who dare
disturb this holy place!” Each creature within 30’ of the statue when it issues its threat must make
a Blast saving throw. If the save fails, the creature suffers 1d6 {Se!} damage and is **deafened**.
If the save succeeds, the creature suffers half damage but is not deafened (though its ears may ache
and ring). A deafened creature suffers a -2 penalty to surprise rolls and has a 2 in 6 chance of
failing any attempt to cast a spell, read a scroll, or utter a command word, but is immune to
additional thundering threats. A deafened creature can make another saving throw at the end of its
initiative each round. If the save succeeds, it is no longer deafened (and it becomes vulnerable to
thundering threat again). The noise of a thundering threat automatically triggers an encounter throw
for wandering monsters (if any) and may alert nearby guards or allies.

Chryselephantine statues are **immune** to enchantment effects, electrical damage, necrotic damage,
and poisonous damage. As constructs, they count as enchanted creatures for purposes of spells such
as *dispel evil*and *holy circle*.

###### Ecology

As constructs, animated chryselephantine statues have no natural habitat. They can be found
guarding ancient treasures, dwarven vaults, or places of power or serving powerful spellcasters.

###### Spoils

A destroyed chryselephantine statue can be harvested with Magical Engineering for the following
component useful in magic research:
