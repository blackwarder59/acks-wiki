### Ghoul, Marsh

These murderous undead resemble men, save that their backs are horribly hunched, their teeth
jagged, and their skin clammy greenish-brown pallid hue. Marsh ghouls are as greedy in undeath as
they were in life, and enjoy collecting treasures from the dead. When not hunting or eating, they
can spend hours counting their gold, silver, and gems.

###### Combat

Marsh ghouls are **naturally stealthy**, and characters encountering them have a -2 penalty to
avoid surprise.

They have long-fingered hands with sharp talons at the end of their fingertips, which they use to
rake their targets for 1d6 slashing damage. If both claws successfully strike in one round, the
marsh ghoul **strangles** its target.

The strangled creature immediately suffers an additional 2d6 bludgeoning damage. In addition, if
the creature is an animal, monstrosity, or humanoid, it also begins **choking**. Thereafter, the
marsh ghoul can use its combat action to automatically deal 2d6 bludgeoning damage to the choking
creature each round. The choking creature cannot take any actions or speak. A creature that has been
choking for 10 consecutive rounds starts **slumbering** at the end of the round.

The unfortunate creatures incapacitated by marsh ghouls are carried back to their lairs to be
consumed. The creatures that survive their predations are perhaps even more unfortunate. Any
humanoid creature that suffers the loss of 50% or more of its total hp to a marsh ghoul is infected
with **ghoul fever** and will become a marsh ghoul in 2d6 days. This transformation can be prevented
with the divine spell *cure disease* if cast before the disease has taken full hold.

As undead, marsh ghouls are immune to enchantment effects, necrotic damage, and poisonous damage.
They are inherently evil for purposes of *discern evil*and *holy circle*spells. They are rebuked as
ghouls.

###### Ecology

Marsh ghouls dwell in sunless cellars, graveyards, or ruins in dark bogs, fetid marshes, or
forbidding swamps, emerging only to hunt for victims.

They tend to keep their victims’ bones in sacks so that they can consume the bone-marrow at their
leisure. When marsh ghouls are encountered in a cellar, there will be 1d4 sacks of bones per
creature.

###### Spoils

A destroyed marsh ghoul can be harvested with Healing 2 for the following components useful in
magic research:

* claws (2/6 st., 20gp, *choking grip, swimming*)
* liver (1/6 st., 10gp, *cause disease*)

*‘Ware the marsh-ghoul where it waits,*

*In silence by the hellish gates,*

*Where bones, stripped bare, within sacks lie,*

*For feasting marrow under stygian sky.*
