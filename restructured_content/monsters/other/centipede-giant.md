### Centipede, Giant

Aura’s natural historians disagree as to whether giant centipedes are magical crossbreeds or
atavistic throwbacks to an era when arthropods ruled the world. Whatever their origin that these
foot-long quarter-pound poisonous centipedes prefer dark, wet locations.

###### Combat

Giant centipedes have **terrestrial mechanoreception** enabling them to sense vibration in the
ground over long distances equivalent to line of sight in full daylight. Spells or effects that
would ordinarily cause blindness do not affect the beetle when it is using terrestrial
mechanoreception. However, creatures that are flying, levitating, or otherwise not touching the
ground are invisible to the sense. Terrestrial mechanoreception can penetrate structures and terrain
features.

When they detect prey, giant centipedes attack with a poisonous bite that deals 1 {P} damage. Any
creature damaged by the bite must make a Poison saving throw. If the save succeeds, there is no
effect. If the save fails, the creature becomes **incapacitated** at the end of the centipede’s
initiative. The conditions lasts for 10 days or until the poison is neutralized.

###### Ecology

When a nest of giant centipedes is encountered, there is a 12% chance per centipede that it will be
incubating a clutch of 1d6 eggs. The eggs have 1 hp and weigh 1/1000 st (e.g. 1 coin). Centipede
hatchlings are rarely found in nests, because the larvae immediately disperse into the wild after
they emerge from their eggs.

###### Spoils

A slain giant centipede can be harvested with Animal Husbandry 2 for the following components
useful in magic research:

* bundle of legs (1/6 st., 3gp, *bloody flux*)
* mandibles (1/6 st., 3gp, *slumber*)

If not used for magic research, a giant centipede’s mandibles fetch 1gp and weigh 1/6 st. Its venom
(onset time of 1 turn, +2 saving modifier, target incapacitated for 1d10 turns) fetches 50gp and
weighs 1/6 st.

###### Encounter

A centuries-old building, some 75’ square, perhaps the villa of some lord from antiquity, has
fallen into rubble. The collapse of the walls and ceiling has shattered the flagstones in the floor,
creating large pockets of debris encircled by foundation stones. Between the debris piles are pools
of murky, polluted water. **15 giant centipedes** have formed a nest here. One of the centipedes is
incubating **6 centipede eggs**.
