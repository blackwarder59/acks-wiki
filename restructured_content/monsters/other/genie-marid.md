### Genie, Marid

Genies are sapient humanoids native to the Elemental Spheres with powerful magical abilities. They
are often summoned by mages to render services and sometimes bound in bottles, rings, and other
items.

Genies from the Elemental Sphere of Water are called marids. They stand 15’9” tall and have
aquamarine complexions, grey-green eyes, and blue-tinted black hair. They dress in flowing clothing
adorned with fine jewelry. Marid speak their own language, as well as Ancient Zaharan, Classical
Auran, Common, Opelenean, and Shebatean.

###### Combat

Marids have several **spell-like abilities**, each of which can be used thrice per day: *capsizing
wave, create food, create water, create objects, invisibility, level water, perpetual figment, water
breathing, and weave water*. All these abilities function at caster level 14.

Each use of *create objects* can create up to 10 st of objects worth up to 100gp / st. The
craftsmanship in created objects is equivalent to 3 ranks of Crafting proficiency. An efreet
summoned by ritual magic can create permanent objects, but one summoned by spells can only create
temporary objects. These vanish when *dispelled* or the summoning ends.

As a full-round action, a marid can become a **frigid wave** 24’ wide and 12’ high. When in wave
form, the marid can move at a combat speed of 30’ over land and 60’ over water. If the wave moves
onto or through one or more creatures during the move, each such creature must make a Blast saving
throw. If the throw fails, the wave deals 3d6 {C!} damage and forces the creature contacted to make
a swimming throw or begin drowning. If the wave moves onto or through one or more vessels during its
move, each vessel takes 3d6 {C!} structural damage. If the vessel is a galley or longship, its
captain must also make a successful Seafaring throw of 16+ (12+ if master mariner) or the vessel
capsizes and begins sinking. The wave can move through creatures and vessels without penalty, but it
cannot move through or damage structures. The genie can revert to its true form at the end of its
initiative if desired. If the marid’s movement in wave form carried it onto land, the marid must
revert to its true form at the end of its initiative.

All marids are **immune** to mundane damage and cold damage.

A marid summoned with ritual magic can be compelled to grant up to 3 *wishes* in lieu of other
services. (No effect short of ritual magic can compel or influence a marid’s response to a
***wish*** in any way.) Marid are difficult to break to a spellcaster’s will, so magical items
calling upon marid are rare.

###### Ecology

In the Elemental Sphere of Water, the marids dwell in underwater cities that bob and drift in the
depths of an infinite ocean. They appear on Aurëpos when called forth by a spell or well of
elemental water.
