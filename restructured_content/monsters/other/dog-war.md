### Dog, War

War dogs are heavy, fierce mastiffs trained to kill on command. While dangerous, they are capable
of great loyalty to their masters when properly trained. When used in battle, war dogs are usually
equipped with spiked scale barding, which increases AC to 5 and damage to 1d6+1. Feral or wild war
dogs are as dangerous as wolves and a large pack can threaten humans.

| Region of Aurëpos by Realm | War Dog Breed |
| Auran Empire | Achaean Colossus |
| Dwarves | Mountain Mastiff |
| Elves | Argollëan Wolfhound |
| Jutland | Birstad Elkhound |
| Rorn | Golden Bear Dog |
| Sunset Kingdoms | Western Mastiff |

###### Combat

War dogs have **acute hearing** and **acute olfaction.** They gain a +2 bonus to avoid surprise in
their natural habitat. They can track the scent of creatures for up to 2 miles with the equivalent
of one rank of Tracking proficiency.

###### Ecology

When war dogs are encountered in their den, the adults will be rearing 1d6 juvenile dogs and 1d3
baby dogs. Juvenile dogs have AC 1, Spd 120’, HD 1+1, and attack with a bite (1d2 {P}). Baby dogs
have AC 0, Spd 120’, HD 1-1, and attack with a fierce nibble (1 {P}).

###### Spoils

A slain war dog with extraordinary attributes can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor
(Butchery) or Trapping for the following component:

* heart (3/6 st, 35gp, *discern evil, faithful companion*)

War dogs can be readily tamed and trained as guards, and they are widely used throughout Aurëpos.

###### Encounter

A wrecked wagon rests here, its frame haphazardly tilted to one side, where its wooden wheels have
sheared off. A set of three tent-sized iron cages have tumbled out of the wagon and bounced open on
the ground adjacent. The cages are splattered with blood from a nearby man’s body, now gnawed to the
point of unrecognizability. The **three war dogs** that were being transported in the cage now make
their den in the cool shade below the wagon body. All of the dogs have scars on the haunches,
evidencing brutal treatment, and they will growl loudly at any approaching characters. The war dogs
were tamed and trained as guard animals, and a character with Animal Training (dogs) might be able
to safely handle them on a successful reaction roll (see p. XX). Due to their brutal treatment,
however, a -4 penalty applies to their reactions.

**War dogs (3):** Spd 150’,AC 3, HD 2+2, hp 19, 12, 10, #AT 1 (bite 8+), dmg 1d6 {P}, Save F1, ML
+2, AL N, XP 35
