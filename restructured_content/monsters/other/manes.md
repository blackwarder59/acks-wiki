### Manes

Manes are magically corporealized souls of the dead which have not yet transmigrated to new bodies
– or at least so the Empyrean theologians claim. The Chthonic cultists assert that manes are the
last vestiges of deal souls who, having failed to necromantically prepare themselves in life for
immortality, are doomed to soon disperse into oblivion.

The reasons why a soul might linger as a manes vary. Some manes are actively venerated by their
descendants, whose worship sustains them in a sort of semi-divine status. Some might just be
sustaining their existence for a brief period of time through their own will, dreading the destiny
of rebirth or dissolution.

Unlike incorporeal undead, which linger on, manes have left the Celestial Sphere and return only
when summoned or, occasionally, when a portal to the Empyrean Heaven or Chthonic Darkness draws them
through. Upon returning to our sphere, manes take on a semi-corporeal form that resembles their
state in life, albeit one with grey skin, dead eyes, and gravely utterances. They will speak
whatever languages they knew in life.

###### Combat

Manes will manifest with ghostly weapons that resemble those they used in life. These will always
be small or medium melee weapons that deal 1d6 {W!} damage. Manes without weapons can attack with a
ghastly bite that deals 1d6 {P!} damage.

All manes are **immune** to necrotic and poisonous damage and **resistant** to all other mundane
damage. As incarnations, manes can be held at bay by *holy circle* anddispelled with *counterspell*
or *dispel magic*. Lawful manes (sometimes called “lares”) can be detected with *discern good* and
destroyed with *dispel good*, while chaotic manes (called “lemures”) are revealed by *discern evil*
and destroyed with *dispel evil.*

Being only semicorporeal, manes cannot exert leverage on the corporeal world nor bear loads of
corporeal matter. They cannot carry equipment, open doors or chests, or trigger traps. They cannot
disarm, force back, grapple, or knock down targets via special maneuvers. However, they are still
blocked and damaged by corporeal matter (subject to their resistance).

###### Ecology

Manes are summoned from the spheres where the dead linger, the Empyrean Heaven or Chthonic
Darkness. They have no natural habitat in Aurëpos.

###### Spoils

A destroyed mane can be harvested with Alchemy 2 for the following component useful in magic
research:

* larvae (*holy blessing, holy circle, holy prayer,* 13gp)
