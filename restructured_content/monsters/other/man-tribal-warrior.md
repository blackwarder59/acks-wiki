### Man, Tribal Warrior

Tribal warriors are rarely seen outside remote regions far from the Auran Empire. They are found
primarily in Ulruk, throughout the coastal Ivory Kingdoms and especially the inland jungles. While
lacking the sophisticated technology of civilized realms, tribal warriors are fierce combatants and
skilled hunters.

About 25% of tribal warriors are Chaotic cannibals who kill and eat other sapient creatures.
Chaotic tribal warriors are always Hostile to strangers. Neutral tribal warriors, while
superstitious and suspicious of strangers, roll reactions normally.

###### Combat

33% of tribal warriors will be veterans with 1 HD equipped with bola net, 3 javelins, hand axe, and
leather armor. The remaining 66% will be regulars with 1-1 HD equipped with bola, 5 feathered darts,
hand axe, and hide armor.

The veterans have **animal reflexes** that grant a +1 bonus to initiative and are **skilled
warriors** that gain a +1 damage bonus. Both regulars and veterans are **proficient runners** (150’
speed).

###### Ecology

Each gang of tribal warriors will be led by a 2nd level barbarian. Each band of tribal warriors
will be led by a 3rd level barbarian. A tribal village will be ruled by a 7th level barbarian chief.
As long as the chief is alive, the tribal warriors will gain a +2 bonus to morale rolls.

Tribal villages will have adult noncombatants (adolescent, disabled, elderly, nursing, or pregnant)
and juveniles equal to 100% and 300% of the number of tribal warriors respectively. These have Spd
90’, AC 0, 1 hp, ML -4, and do not fight.

When tribal warriors are encountered in a village, certain additional creatures will be present.
The village will be protected by 4d6 trained hunting dogs or 2d6 cheetahs. There will be oxen, pigs,
and cows equal to 100%, 100%, and 300% of the number of commoners. In addition, there will be a 6th
level barbarian serving as sub-chief and a 6th level shaman advising the chief. The tribal leaders
will be equipped with spear, hand axe, shield, and leather armor.

###### Spoils

A slain tribal warrior can be harvested with Healing 1 for the following component useful in magic
research:

* heart (1/6 st, 5gp or 10gp, *beguile humanoid*)

Tribal warriors do not have magic items by treasure type. Instead, tribal leaders should be
assigned magic items using the ***ACKS II JJ***rules (p. XX), whether they are in lair or not.

###### Notes

This monster listing is just an example. It should not be construed to mean raiders cannot have
other proficiencies or troop types. The Judge can and should stock his wilderness with raiders that
are trained and equipped in sensible ways for his campaign!
