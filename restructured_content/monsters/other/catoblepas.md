### Catoblepas

The catoblepas is a monstrosity standing about 7’ tall, measuring 9’ from snout to tail, and
weighing about 4,000 lbs. The body resembles that of a musk ox with a brownish-black coat and shaggy
horse-like mane. Its neck is long and thin, while its head is so large and heavy that it rarely
raises it. When it does raise its head, it reveals narrow bloodshot eyes set over a large mouth
filled with sharp teeth. It feeds exclusively upon poisonous shrubs and roots, a diet which makes
its exhalations deadly to any creatures nearby.

###### Combat

Catoblepas have **acute olfaction** that grants them a +1 bonus to avoid surprise in their natural
habitat. They use this to find the poisonous vegetation upon which they feed.

The **foul miasma** which the catoblepas exhales is extremely dangerous. Any creature that starts
its initiative or moves within 5’ of a catoblepas must make a Death saving throw. If the save fails,
the victim becomes **paralyzed** with painful convulsions and dies after 1 turn.

In combat, a catoblepas will bite creatures with its razor-sharp teeth for 2d6 {P!}damage. In lieu
of biting, the catoblepas can direct its **murderous gaze** in a cone 60' long and 30' wide in front
of itself. Each creature within the cone that is beholding the catoblepas must make a Death saving
throw. If the save succeeds, the creature is not affected. If the save fails, the creature is
instantly slain.

Catoblepas have tough hides that are **resistant** to mundane bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing
damage. They are **immune** to poisonous damage.

###### Ecology

The catoblepas inhabits bogs, marshes, swamps, and other fetid places where poisonous plants
flourish and foul air blows. When catoblepas are encountered in a wilderness den, there is an 85%
chance the adults will be rearing bleppies. Roll 1d4 for age and number; 1-2, it’s 1d3 babies, 3-4
it’s 1d2 juveniles. Juvenile catoblepas have AC 5, Spd 90’, HD 4, and attack with one bite (1d6
{P}). Baby catoblepas have AC 4, Spd 90’, HD 2+2, and attack with one nibble (1d2 {P}). Neither have
murderous gazes.

###### Spoils

If a catoblepas is encountered in the wilderness, there is a 70% chance it will be grazing on a
patch of poisonous herbs. Roll 1d6 to determine the patch: 1 – 3d10 doses of yew, 2 – 4d6 does of
hellebore, 3 – 4d6 doses of hemlock, 4 – 3d6 does of foxglove, 5 – 2d6+1 doses of belladonna, 6 –
2d6+1 doses of henbane. Treat this as a dangerous terrain encounter (see ***ACKS II JJ*** p. XX).

A slain catoblepas can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the
following components useful in magic research:

* eyes (12 st., 720gp, *extinguish life, flesh to ash*)
* liver (12 st., 720gp, *neutralize poison, purify food & water*)
* stomach (11 st., 660gp, *cause disease, poison*)
