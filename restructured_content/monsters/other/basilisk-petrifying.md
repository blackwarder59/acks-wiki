### Basilisk, Petrifying

The petrifying basilisk was created by crossbreeding a primordial basilisk with a gorgon. Like its
progenitor, it resembles a reptilian monster with a dun-colored body and mustard-hued underbelly
with a length of 10’ and weight of 300 lbs. However, petrifying basilisks lack the horn
characteristic of their primordial kin.

###### Combat

Petrifying basilisks have tough hides that are **resistant** to mundane bludgeoning, piercing, and
slashing damage.

The bite of a petrifying basilisk can turn a creature to stone. Any creature that is bitten must
make a Paralysis saving throw. If the save succeeds, the creature is unaffected. If the save fails,
the creature is instantaneously **petrified**.

In lieu of biting, a petrifying basilisk can direct its **petrifying gaze** in in a cone 60' long
and 30' wide in front of itself. Each creature within the cone that is beholding the basilisk must
make a Paralysis saving throw. If the save succeeds, the creature is not affected. If the save
fails, the creature is instantly **petrified**.

###### Ecology

Petrifying basilisks often live in dense woods or dungeons. When petrifying basilisks are
encountered in their nest there is a 10% chance per basilisk that it will be incubating 1d3 eggs.
Basilisk eggs have 1 hp and weigh 2/6 st. Basilisk hatchlings are rarely found in nests, because the
hatchlings immediately disperse into the wild after they emerge from their eggs.

###### Spoils

Any treasure in a petrifying basilisk’s nest will be on petrified victims, and will only be
accessible if the victims are restored to flesh.

A slain petrifying basilisk can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined
ranks) for the following components useful in magic research:

* eyes (8 2/6 st., 500gp, *blinding flash, cone of paralysis, hypnotic sigil, petrification*)
* gizzard (8 2/6 st., 500gp, *depetrification, earth’s mire*)
* Basilisks are difficult to train, but their powerful abilities allow them to command a premium.

###### Lore

*There are two species of basilisk in Aurëpos: the horned basilisk and the smoothskull basilisk. Of
the dangers of the horned basilisk, whose noxious miasma slays any who inhale it, I have already
written. But the dangers posed by the smoothskull basilisk are actually far greater, for the very
sight of the creature can turn a man to stone. An encounter with such a basilisk cost us seven
members of our expedition, among them my beloved Optëlitas. Had I but looked at the basilisk’s
skull, I could have warned them, and she would still be flesh… but then I would have been stone.*
