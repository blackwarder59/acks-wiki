### Titan, Greater

The sage of the Auran Empire believe that the titans are the primordial offspring of the gods –
some say the illicit offspring of Türas and Telith, others fastened by the will of Ammonar, only to
be cast down to earth when they threatened his power. The titans themselves claim that they sprang
from blood shed by the gods during the battle for the Tablet of Destiny. Whatever their origin, the
titans are an awe-inspiring and powerful race taller and nobler than giants.

Greater titans stand 22’ tall and weigh 7,500lbs. They have blue-tinted black hair, cloud-grey
eyes, and skin in tones of bronze ranging from a light tan to a lustrous copper. They wear flowing
clothing and fancy jewelry. In battle, they wield great spears or giant falx with polished bronze
blades.

Greater titans always speak Common, Classical Auran, and 1d6 other tongues, often ancient or dead
languages.

###### Combat

Titans can smash with their fists or with weapons for extraordinary damage. When smashing with
piercing or slashing weapons, titans deliver **vicious blows** that deal an additional 6 points per
smash. When smashing with bludgeoning weapons, titans can **topple and fling** large or smaller
creatures with every attack (p. XX). The creature struck must make a successful size-adjusted
Paralysis saving throw or be knocked prone and forced back a number of feet equal to the damage
dealt. The titan can cleave if the creature fails its save against his smash.

Instead of smashing, titans can hurl boulders to a distance of 1200’, dealing 4d6 {B!} damage in a
5’ radius to the impact point. When hurling a boulder, a titan functions like a heavy ballista using
the rules for Missile Attacks with Artillery (***ACKS II RR****,* p. XX). However, the titan does
not need to reload, so it can throw a boulder each round if it has sufficient ammo.

Greater titans can **summon weather**(as the spell) at will. During thunder storms, they can use a
combat action to unleash a 15d6 {E!} damage **lightning strike** *(as the spell)* every round. They
are **immune** to electric damage. All great titans can **breathe water** (as the spell) as well as
air.

There is a 30% chance a greater titan will have Mage abilities at level 2d6+1.

###### Ecology

Though sometimes found in dungeons, greater titans usually dwell in mountain citadels on high
peaks, in sky-castles atop clouds, or in submarine strongholds below the sea. They protect their
lairs with trained creatures of various types: in a mountain citadel, these will be 2d4 griffons; in
a sky castle, 1d3 large rocs; in a submarine stronghold, 3d6 giant crabs.

###### Spoils
