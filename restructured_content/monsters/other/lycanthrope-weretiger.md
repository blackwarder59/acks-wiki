### Lycanthrope, Weretiger

Weretigers are lycanthropes who can transform into tigers. In their tiger form, they measure about
7’6” long and weigh about 500 lbs. In their human form, they often have almond-shaped eyes, supple
muscles, and colorful streaks of black or gold in their hair.

The Chthonic god Ravanor, the Bitter Prince, created the first weretigers to cause terror in the
weak and innocent. Like their god, weretigers are arrogant, cunning, and utterly ruthless.

Weretigers prefer to find mates from among the human population, seeking out the most beautiful and
healthy specimens and infecting them with lycanthropy.

###### Combat

In beast form, weretigers have **acute hearing** and **acute olfaction.** They gain a +2 bonus to
avoid surprise in their natural habitat. They can track the scent of creatures for up to 4 miles
with the equivalent of two ranks of Tracking proficiency.

As beasts, they are also **quite agile** (Acrobatics 12+) and **good climbers** (Climbing 5+).
Their **lightning reflexes** grant a +1 bonus to initiative. They are **naturally stealthy** when in
native habitats, where creatures encountering them suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls.

If a weretiger charges a creature or leaps over it (using Acrobatics), and successfully hits it
with both claws, it immediately **pounces** onthe creature. The weretiger’s subsequent bite attack
automatically hits and the creature that has been pounced on must make a successful size-adjusted
Paralysis saving throw or be knocked **prone**.

###### Ecology

Weretigers prefer to dwell in forests or jungles near human settlements. In the Sunset Kingdoms,
weretigers are often considered avatars of the gods or rakshasa, and placated with offerings of
food, wine, and treasure.

###### Spoils

A slain weretiger can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the
following components useful in magic research:

* blood (3 st, 180gp, *deflect ordinary weapons, skinchange*)
* scalp (2 5/6 st, 170gp, *call of the great cats, silent step, transform beast*)

Because they revert to human form when slain, werertigers cannot be harvested for claws, fangs, or
fur.
