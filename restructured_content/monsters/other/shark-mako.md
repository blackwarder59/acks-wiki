### Shark, Mako

Mako sharks are aggressive predators that will unhesitatingly attack large prey. A typical specimen
has a grey or tan hide with a length of 12’ to 15’ weight of 1,050 lbs.

###### Combat

Mako sharks have a lateral line system that affords them **aquatic mechanoreception**. They can
“see” in water up to 180’ by sensing changes in water current and water pressure.

They also have **acute olfaction** granting them a +1 bonus to avoid surprise in their native
habitat. They can sense blood in the water to a range of 300’.

Once they sense blood, they become **furious feeders** and will fight to the death without making
morale rolls.

Mako sharks are among the fastest swimmers in the oceans. They are also **prodigious leapers**; a
mako shark that charges on its initiative can jump up to 20’ vertically and horizontally out of the
water at any point in its movement.

###### Ecology

Mako sharks are solitary predators. However, they are often found in groups in abundant feeding
grounds. Like other sharks, mako sharks give birth to live young. The pups are immediately
independent and receive no parental care.

###### Spoils

A slain mako shark with exceptional attributes can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor
(Butchery) or Trapping for the following component useful in magic research:

* dorsal fin (2 1/6 st, 135gp, *righteous wrath, swimming*, weapon +1)

Mako sharks can be trained only with great difficulty. Only the most foolish animal trainers even
try!

###### Lore

*The Aquarium of Metapon-Nemo, in Istakahr, must surely be considered one of the great wonders of
the world. A vast structure which rivals the size of Aura’s Grand Colosseum, it has been used for
centuries by the pharaohs of Kemesh to glorify their grim gods.*

*Bel is honored with sea battles staged between galleys crewed by gladiators, who must win or
drown. Nargund and Lammala are commemorated with pitched battles between betwitched sea monsters…
while Dirgion, the Doombringer, he is honored by deadly races.*

*The contestants – captives, debtors, slaves, and occasionally volunteers – are each marked with a
small cut, then made to enter the water at one end of the Aquarium. Their objective is to be the
fastest to swim to the far end. When the contestants are halfway, however, the underwater gates
below the Aquarium are opened to release hungry mako sharks. It is said that no sea creature – not
the dolphin, not the manta ray, not even the mighty whale – can swim as fast as these fell
predators…*
