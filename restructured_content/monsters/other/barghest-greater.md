### Barghest, Greater

Iskara, mother of monsters, bred the first barghests by infusing cacodemon ichor into the bodies of
great wolves. The greater barghests were created as lords and chieftains of their kind, bred by
Iskara with the ichor of her most powerful cacodemons. Every greater barghest is enormous, measuring
around 13’6” long and 8’ tall at the shoulder and weighing 2,900 lbs. Barghests are as intelligent
as mortal men. They can speak Ancient Zaharan, Classical Auran, Common, Elvish, and the dialect of
any local beastmen.

###### Combat

Greater barghests have **acute hearing** and **acute olfaction.** They gain a +2 bonus to avoid
surprise in their natural habitat. They can track the scent of creatures for up to 6 miles with the
equivalent of three ranks of Tracking.

A greater barghest is **dreadful** to confront.A creature which starts its initiative, or moves
within, 60’ of a greater barghest must make a Paralysis saving throw. If the save succeeds, the
creature gains immunity to the effects of every barghest’s dreadfulness for 1 turn. If the save
fails, the creature starts **faltering.** If the creature was already faltering, it becomes
**frightened** instead. The faltering or frightened condition ends if removed magically or if the
greater barghest is destroyed or no longer within 60’.

The bite of a greater barghest is both **venomous** and **maiming**. Any creature damaged by the
bite must make a successful Death saving throw or die in one turn. A creature bitten with an attack
throw of unmodified 20 must make an additional Death saving throw. If the save succeeds, the bite
inflicts double damage dice (8d6). If the save fails, the bite inflicts triple damage dice (12d6)
and the creature loses a limb. Roll 1d6 to determine which limb is lost: 1-2, weapon hand; 3, weapon
arm; 4-5, near leg; 6, far leg. A character who loses a limb is **incapacitated** until he gets 2
weeks of bed rest.

###### Ecology

Greater barghest studs mate rather indiscriminately, coupling with lesser barghests, wargs, dire
wolves, and wolves in order to produce various lupin sub-species. Greater barghest bitches reproduce
rarely and only with their own kind.

When a greater barghest is encountered in its den, there is a 50% chance it will be a bitch rearing
puppies. Roll 1d6 for age and number; 1-4, it’s 1d2 juveniles; 5-6 it’s 1d2+2 babies. Juveniles have
AC 4, Spd 150’, HD 5, and attack with 1 bite (2d6 {P}). Babies have AC 3, Spd 150’, HD 3+3, and 1
bite (1d6 {P}). The bites of the puppies are not maiming.

###### Spoils

A slain greater barghest can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks)
for the following components useful in magic research:

* fangs (22 1/6 st, 1450gp, *carnage, dismember, giant strength, slicing blow*)
* heart (21 2/6 st, 1400gp, *call of the wolf pack, cone of fear, dominate beast, frighten beast,
