### Skeletal Slayer

In life, skeletal slayers were great champions of the Chthonic gods and sorcerer-kings. In undeath,
they continue to serve their evil masters as four-armed skeletal abominations with plate armor
bolted onto their bones and gleaming swords in each of their four bony hands.

Skeleton slayers are intelligent and can speak, usually in an ancient or dead tongue such as
Zaharan. They have no desire to collect treasure. Instead they seek to fulfill their ancient oaths
of duty and to test their mettle in combat, in the best case against worthy opponents.

###### Combat

Skeletal slayers have a **horrific** **visage**. When a creature first beholds one or more skeletal
slayer, and at the start of each round thereafter that the creature beholds one or more slayers, the
creature must make a Paralysis saving throw. The save suffers a -1 penalty per additional skeletal
slayer after the first. If the save fails, the creature is **cowering** until the start of the next
round. If the save succeeds, the creature gains immunity to the effects of every slayer’s horrific
visage for 1 turn.

In combat, skeletal slayers can attack once with each sword (4 attacks total) per combat action. A
successful attack deals 1d8 {S!} damage. Some skeletal slayers are equipped with magic swords; if
so, each sword’s bonus applies separately to the slayer’s attack and damage with that sword.

Skeleton slayers are **immune** to enchantment effects, necrotic damage, piercing damage, and
poisonous damage. They are **resistant** to mundane damage. They are inherently evil for purposes of
*discern evil*and *holy circle*spells and are rebuked as mummies.

###### Ecology

Being undead, skeletal slayers have no native habitat. They are usually found as guardian of the
crypts and tombs of royalty, where they sleep away the centuries in *torpor* until roused by
intruders – or the Awakening.

###### Spoils

A destroyed skeletal slayer can be harvested with Healing 2 for the following components useful in
magic research:

* skull (1 4/6 st., 100gp, *inspire horror, shrieking skull*)
* upper arm bones(3 2/6 st., 200gp, *swift sword,* sword +1)
* lower arm bones (3/26 st., 200gp, *striking,* sword +1)

###### Lore

*Fear not if your body is diseased or ruined, for the strength of your soul can sustain it! Aye,
even if you be reduced to naught but bone, the blessed power of Dirgion can maintain your spiritual
existence forever.*

* Ishme-Dagan, *The Corporium,* Vol. 5, “The Higher Art of Necromancy”
