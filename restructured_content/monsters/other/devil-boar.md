### Devil Boar

The devil boar is a shapeshifting monster capable of transforming between the form of a grotesquely
fat human and an immense boar. Though sometimes mistaken for lycanthropic wereboars, devil boars are
far more malicious. They delight in the taste of human flesh, and always take residence in or near
areas occupied by man so they can easily have people for dinner. They speak the language of the
local population, and do not have their own tongue.

###### Combat

In their human form, devil boars possess a **hypnotic gaze.** A devil boar can use its combat
action to hypnotize a humanoid creature within 60’ which is beholding the devil boar. When targeted,
the creature must make a Spells saving throw at -2. If the save succeeds, the creature is not
affected. If the save fails, the creature is **enslaved** until either the devil boar releases the
creature from its control, the devil boar is destroyed, or the effect is dispelled. The devil boar
can release an enslaved creature from its control at any time without expending an action. A devil
boar can maintain control over no more than one enslaved creatures per HD.

In their boar form, devil boars have the **acute hearing** and **acute olfaction** of giant boars.
They gain a +2 bonus to avoid surprise and can track the scent of creatures for up to 6 miles with
the equivalent of three ranks of Tracking.

Devil boars in either form are immune to all mundane damage. However, damage dealt to devil boars
by silver weapons is considered to be extraordinary damage.

###### Ecology

When devil boars are encountered in their lair, each devil boar has a 75% chance of having 1d3
**enslaved** thralls. Thralls should be rolled up as NPCs using the rules in the ***ACKS II JJ***
(p. XX).

While a devil boar can reproduce naturally, producing piglets that mature over many years, most do
not typically do so. More often, a devil boar creates more of its kind by feeding a human or
demi-human the flesh of his or her spouse, parents, and/or children. Some depraved cultists
voluntarily undergo this ritual, but more often the devil boars transform unwitting or unwilling
victims. The victim can make a Death saving throw to resist the transformation. If the save fails,
the newborn devil boar becomes an obligate cannibal, growing increasingly corpulent with every meal
(1 st per day) until he reaches 90 st and becomes a devil boar. The transformation can be halted
before completion but only by a *remove curse* cast by a 9th level or higher caster. Once the
transformation has occurred, only ritual magic can reverse it.

###### Spoils

A slain devil boar can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the
following components useful in magic research:

* blood (11 4/6 st, 700gp, *curse of swine, skinchange*)
* skin (10 st, 600gp, *deflect ordinary weapons, physical resistance*)
* tongue (11 4/6 st, 700gp, *bewitch humanoid, dominate humanoid, enslave humanoid*)
