### Man, Pilgrim

The common people of Aurëpos rarely leave the vicinity of their hamlets or villages. However, from
time to time, more adventurous or devout sorts will set out on pilgrimages to sacred places, holy
temples, or great festivals and games.

Most pilgrims (65%) are Lawful and pursuing their pilgrimage for reasons of civic or religious
duty. Some (30%) are Neutral and using the pilgrimage as a pretext for adventure or escape. A small
number (5%) are Chaotic cultists or subversives trekking towards dark shrines or places of death.

###### Combat

Pilgrims are not warriors. They lack proficiency with any weapons or armor and suffer a -1 penalty
to attack throws (already factored into their listing) and gain no benefit from high attributes.

If forced to fight, they will defend themselves with quarterstaffs, walking sticks, shepherd’s
crooks, and similar implements, all dealing 1d6-1 damage. However, they must make morale rolls every
round of combat unless their steward is leading them.

###### Ecology

Each troupe of pilgrims will be led by a 1st level crusader watching over them. The crusaders will
be equipped with maces, slings, shields, and chain mail. Each band of pilgrims will be guided by a
2nd level explorer equipped with short bow, short sword, shield, and leather armor.

Pilgrim camps (wilderness lairs) will be led by a vicar (a 5th level crusader). Additionally, there
is a 33% chance a sister disciple (4th level priestess) will be present in the camp. If so, the
priestess will be accompanied by 2d4 novices (1st level priestesses).

Pilgrim leaders should be assigned magic items using the ***ACKS II JJ***rules (p. XX).

###### Spoils

A slain pilgrim can be harvested for the following component useful in magic research:

* heart (1/6 st, 5gp, *beguile humanoid*)

Pilgrims do not have magic items by treasure type. Instead, pilgrim leaders should be assigned
magic items using the ***ACKS II JJ***rules (p. XX), whether they are in lair or not.

###### Notes

This monster listing is just an example. It assumes that pilgrims are normal men and women from the
Auran Empire with some crusaders and explorers to guide them. The GM should feel free to devise
other pilgrims for other regions with different proficiencies, equipment, and leaders.
