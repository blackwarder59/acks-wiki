### Roc, Small

Rocs are living symbols of the power and majesty of Ammonar, the Winged Sun, Empyrean god of light
and law. Small rocs resemble gigantic peregrine falcons, with slate-grey backs and wings with a
white underbelly marked by fine black bands. Though the smallest of the rocs, their wingspans still
extend to 55’ tip-to-tip and their bodies weigh around 800lbs.

Clever and long-lived, small rocs often (65%) speak both Common and Classical Auran as well as
their own screeching tongue. Though not common, they can be found throughout the forests and
mountains of Aurëpos.

###### Combat

Rocs have **acute vision** and **alertness**, granting them a +2 bonus to avoid surprise in their
natural habitat.

Rocs are inherently lawful creatures. Chaotic characters encountering rocs suffer -2 penalty to
reaction rolls, while neutral characters suffer a -1 penalty.

A flying roc can make a **dive attack** with their talons. A dive attack inflicts double the normal
damage dice (2d6 {S} / 2d6 {S}). If the roc hits a creature smaller than itself with both its talons
while making a dive attack, the creature must make a size-adjusted Paralysis saving throw. If the
save fails, the creature is **grabbed**.

###### Ecology

When small rocs are encountered in their aerie, there is a 15% chance each roc is guarding
offspring. Roll 1d4 for their number and age: 1-2, it’s 1d3 eggs, 3-4, it’s 1d3-1 juveniles.
Juvenile small rocs have the characteristics of giant raptors. Small roc eggs have 1 hp and weigh
3/6 st.

Rocs defending their young do not have to make morale rolls; they always fight to the death.

###### Spoils

A slain small rocs can harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the
following components useful in magic research:

* beak (4 st, 240gp, *cataclysm, force of impetus, sharpness, striking*)
* eyes (2 st, 120gp, *lay of the land, locate distant object, locate place of power*)
* tail feathers (3 3/6 st, 210gp, *circling winds, gale of winds*)

A small roc’s 6d10 flight feathers each fetch 3d6gp and weigh 1/8 st. A small roc’s two talons each
fetch 5gp and weigh 1/6 st.

Although sapient, rocs are difficult to train because of their sheer size, power, and speed. One
mistake can cause the would-be roc rider to die.
