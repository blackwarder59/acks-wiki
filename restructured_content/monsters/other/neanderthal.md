### Neanderthal

Strange throwbacks to an aeon so distant that even the Day Without Night seems recent in
comparison, these humanoids are the savage cousins to humans. They measure about 6’6” tall and weigh
around 220 lbs. Their faces have large brow ridges, huge dark eyes, snub noses, large fangs, and
receding chins, while their bodies are bulky and hirsute. Neanderthals are found only in the deepest
caves of the Jutting and Meniri Mountains and the darkest jungles of Ulrukan.

Neanderthals revere cave bears as symbols of courage and prowess. Young neanderthals must hunt cave
bears during their tribal rites of passage, while chieftains typically lead a cave bear hunt
annually for religious purposes. They despise beastmen and morlocks, and kill them on sight.

Despite their primitive lifestyle, neanderthals are as intelligent as humans. They speak their own
language, which mixes animalistic growls and roars with human vocalizations. Chiefs, shamans, and
witch doctors have a 50% chance to speak the language of the local humans in the area.

###### Combat

Neanderthals are **formidable warriors** and gain a +1 damage bonus. 50% of neanderthal warriors
are equipped with hide armor, spear, and hand axe. The remaining 50% are equipped with hide armor,
bola, and club.

###### Ecology

Each neanderthal band will be led by a champion with 2 AC, 3 HD, and 15 hp. A neanderthal lair will
be ruled by a strong, cunning chieftain with AC 3, 6 HD, and a +2 damage bonus. As long as the
chieftain is alive, the neanderthals will gain a +2 bonus to morale rolls.

Neanderthal lairs will have noncombatants (adolescent, disabled, elderly, nursing, or pregnant) and
children equal to 200% and 200% of the number of warriors, respectively. Neanderthal noncombatants
have Spd 120’, 0 AC, 1 HD, and ML -2. If forced to fight, they attack with clubs or stones (1d4
{B}). Neanderthal children have Spd 90’, 0 AC, 1hp, ML -4, and do not fight.

If neanderthals are encountered in a wilderness lair, there is a 75% chance the lair will be
protected by 3d6 trained cave gorillas.

###### Spoils
