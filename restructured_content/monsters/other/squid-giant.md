### Squid, Giant

These voracious mollusks are aggressive predators that attack almost anything they meet. A typical
giant squid has a mantle measuring 8’ long, two large tentacles measuring around 36’ long, and eight
small tentacles measuring around 30’ long. The monstrous mollusks can weigh up to 1,500 lbs. Their
eyes, almost a foot in diameter, glow brightly in the dark.

###### Combat

Giant squids have **acute vision** and **acute olfaction** granting them a +2 bonus to avoid
surprise in their native habitat. Their fluid-filled statocysts grant them **aquatic
mechanoreception** that enables them to “see” underwater to a range of 270’ (p. XX).

A giant squid can attack from up to 15’ away with its tentacles. Its large tentacles can attack
vessels or creatures of large size or larger. Its smaller tentacles can attack any creatures within
reach. A giant squid deals 1/3 structural damage to vessels.

A hit with a large tentacle deals 1d8 {B!} damage and **restrains** the creature or vessel. A hit
with a small tentacle deals 1d4 {B!} damage and **restrains** the creature.

While a creature or vessel is restrained, the squid can automatically deal 1d8 (large tentacle) or
1d4 (small tentacle) {B!} damage on its initiative each round to the restrained creature or
one-third that to the restrained vessel. Doing so counts as the squid’s attack with that tentacle.

A restrained creature cannot move but can still attack, cast spells, take actions in lieu of
attacking, or attempt to escape. A restrained vessel cannot move, ram, or steer, but any crew can
continue to act normally. The normal rules of the restrained condition (p. XX) otherwise apply.

To cut off a tentacle, an attack must deal at least 10 (large) or 6 (small) {S} damage to it in one
blow. Any damage dealt beyond the required amount is not dealt to the squid (the tentacle was
severed).

Once per day, a giant squid can use its combat action to create a 40' radius **cloud of black ink**
around itself. The ink has the effect of a *tenebrosity* spell but it disperses into the water after
1 turn.

###### Ecology

Giant squid do not establish nests or exhibit any parental care for their offspring. After being
inseminated, a female squid attaches a gelatinous mass of eggs to seafloor, seaweed, or rocks. The
mass of squid eggs has 1 hp and weighs 1 3/6 st.

###### Spoils

A slain giant squid can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the
following components useful in magic research:

* radial muscles (8 2/6 st, 500gp, *swift sword*)
* ink sac (10 st, 600gp, *shrouding fog, tenebrosity*)
* tentacles (8 2/6 st, 500gp, *choking grip, sunder structure*)
