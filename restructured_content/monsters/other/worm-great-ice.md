### Worm, Great Ice

The great ice worm is a horrific myriapod found in the high slopes of the Jutting Mountains. A
typical specimen measures 25’ long, with a pale blue chitinous exoskeleton adorned by a pair of
vestigial wings and twelve pairs of segmented legs ending in tarsal claws. Auran sages believe the
worms might be among the most primitive creatures still extant in Aurëpos. Whereas higher forms of
life such as mammals generate heat, great ice worms are so primeval as to actually generate cold…

###### Combat

Great ice worms are **naturally stealthy** when lurking in ice or snow, and creatures encountering
them there suffer a -2 penalty to avoid surprise.

An **aura of intense cold** surrounds a great ice worm in a 10’ radius. Any creature that begins
its initiative in, or moves into, the aura suffers 1d8 extraordinary cold damage and must make a
Blast saving throw. If the save fails, the creature becomes **hypothermic**. If already hypothermic,
it loses 1 CON. If a creature in the aura attacks the great ice worm with a melee weapon and rolls
an unmodified attack throw of 1, the weapon instantly becomes freezing cold and might shatter. A
non-magical weapon automatically shatters. A magic weapon shatters unless it succeeds on a Death
save (use the wearer’s target value, adding any magic bonus if applicable).

If a great ice worm succeeds on a bite attack against a creature of large size or less with an
unmodified attack throw of 19-20, it can **swallow** the creature (p. XX). The swallowed creature
suffers 2d6 {A!} damage at the start of its initiative each round and the effects of the aura. The
worm can cleave after.

###### Ecology

When a nest of great ice worms is encountered, there is a 20% chance that each worm will have
recently buried 1d8 eggs nearby. The eggs have 2 hp and weigh 5 3/6 st. Worm spawn disperse after
birth and are not found in the den.

###### Spoils

Because of their propensity to swallow creatures whole, an encounter with ice worms can yield
treasure even outside the creature’s lair. The treasure (if any) is always found inside the
creatures’ bellies.

A slain ice worm can be harvested with Animal Husbandry 2 for the following components useful in
magic research:

* scales (13 3/6 st., 810gp, *shatter blade,* armor +3)
* stomach (12 st., 720gp, *create chasm, circle of agony, locate treasure*)
* tarsal claws (12 st., 720gp, *disintegrate, cone of frost, disintegration, protection from
temperature, wall of frost*)

A great ice worm’s two horns each fetch 2d12x25gp and weigh 1 st per 80gp value. Its armored hide
fetches 1,500gp and weighs 25st. Its mandibles each fetch 32gp and weigh 3/6 st.
