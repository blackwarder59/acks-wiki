### Dog, Hunting

Hunting dogs are fast, lean hounds trained to track and bring down prey by working in packs. The
breeds are differentiated by whether they hunt by scent or sight. Both breeds are kept by humans and
demi-humans throughout Aurëpos, and many feral or wild dogs of similar build are found throughout
the countryside.

| --- | --- |
| Region of Aurëpos | Hunting Dog Breed |
| Auran Empire | Red Bloodhound (scent) |
| Dwarves | Underterrier (scent) |
| Elves | Argollëan Windhound (sight) |
| Jutland | Jutting Mountain Cur (scent) |
| Rorn | Rornish Staghound (sight) |
| Sunset Kingdoms | Pharoah Hound (sight) |

###### Combat

Hunting dogs have **acute hearing** and **acute olfaction.** They gain a +2 bonus to avoid surprise
in their natural habitat.

Scent hounds can track the scent of creatures for up to 6 miles with the equivalent of three ranks
of Tracking proficiency. Sight hounds cannot track, but they are faster than scent hounds, with a
speed of 80’/240’.

###### Ecology

When hunting dogs are encountered in their den, the adults will be rearing 1d6 juvenile dogs and
1d3-1 baby dogs. Juvenile dogs have AC 0, Spd 150’, HD 1/2, and attack with a bite (1d2 {P!}). Baby
dogs have AC -1, Spd 150’, 1 hp, ML -4, and fight only with adorable nibbles that melt the heart but
deal no damage.

###### Spoils

A slain hunting dog with extraordinary attributes can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor
(Butchery) or Trapping for the following component:

* heart (2/6 st, 15gp, *faithful companion, locate animal or pant, locate object*)

Affable, intelligent, and pack-oriented, hunting dogs are exceptionally easy to train.

###### Encounter

A small farmhouse stands in a clearing just ahead, a compact field to one side. The field is
overgrown with weeds and littered with dog manure. The house itself appears neglected, and a
hound-sized hole has been chewed into the bottom of the back door. A pack of **11 hunting dogs**
have made the house their den, the family who owned the house having long since fled. The dogs are
starving and feral, but a character with the Animal Training (dogs) or Beast Friendship proficiency
can gain their trust with a Friendly reaction roll. In one of the bedrooms, a litter of **five
pups** plays with their mother.

Hunting dogs (11): Spd 180’, AC 2, HD 1+1, hp 6 each, #AT 1 (bite 9+), Dmg 1d4 {P}, Save F1, ML 0,
