### Worm, Giant (Overview)

Giant worms are monstrous annelids that dwell in the dank depths of the earth. A giant worm’s
invertebrate body is divided into hundreds of chitin-armored segments coated with thick acidic mucus
within which bristle millions of ceaselessly-moving cilia. The worm’s head is almost entirely taken
up by its hideous maw, from which spring forth three pairs of concentric mandibles that seize prey
and instantly retract with the unfortunate victim back into the worm’s gut. Encircling the mouth is
a ring of long mucus-coated antennas that squirm and wiggle towards prey.

###### Combat

Since eyesight is of little use in the dark, giant worms navigate and hunt by sensing vibration and
tremors in earth with long antenna on their heads and millions of bristling cilia distributed across
their segmented bodies.

The worms’ **terrestrial mechanoreception** is so acute that even a repeating pattern of footfalls
can attract them from miles away. No spells or effects that would ordinarily blind a creature will
affect a giant worm, but opponents that are flying, levitating, or otherwise not touching the ground
are considered hidden to them.

###### Ecology

Giant worms are rarely seen on the surface, but sometimes they slither near enough to penetrate
into human and demi-human excavations such as dungeons and dwarven vaults. The dwarfs claim that
giant worms are but one of myriad nameless things that crawl the underdeep, but most Auran sages
dismiss these assertions as tall tales intended to keep humans out of the dwarves’ deep roads.

###### Spoils

Because of their propensity to swallow creatures whole, any encounter with giant worms might yield
treasure, whether they are wandering or in their nests. The treasure (if any) is always found inside
the worm’s gizzard.
