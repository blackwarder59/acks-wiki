### Swarm, Rat

A rat swarm consists of hundreds of ordinary rats. A rat swarm might be roused if its nest or
feeding ground is invaded, if it is presented with strange smells or bright lights, or if summoned
by magic.

###### Combat

A rat swarm spreads over an area of 100 square feet per HD. A 2 HD swarm is usually 20’ x 10’, a 3
HD swarm is 20’ x 15’, and a 4 HD swarm is 20’ x 20’. However it can expand or shrink by 50% in
either direction as conditions merit.

Rat swarms do not so much attack as simply engulf everything in their path. Any creature that
starts its initiative in the swarm’s area, or enters the swarm on its initiative, is **engulfed.**

A creature engulfed by a rat swarm must make a Paralysis saving throw at the end of its initiative.
If the save fails, the creature takes 1d6 {P} damage and is knocked **prone**. If the save succeeds,
the creature takes half that damage and keeps its footing. If, on its initiative, the engulfed
creature uses its movement action to flee from the swarm at least 20’, or uses its combat action to
ward off the swarm with a torch or weapon, it gains a +4 bonus on its saving throw. Warding off a
rat swarm with a torch or weapon also deals 1d4 damage to the swarm.

The engulfed condition ends when the creature starts its initiative outside the area of the swarm.
Unlike insect swarms, rat swarms do not cause creatures to become vexed.

Characters damaged by a rat swarm have a 5% chance of becoming infected with a disease. The Judge
should roll 1d100 on the Disease table (p. XX) to determine the disease and its effects. *Cure
disease* is, of course, effective in eliminating this illness.

Rat swarms are **immune** to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, except when dealt by
creatures warding off the rats (e.g. the rat swarm cannot be directly attacked as a target).

###### Ecology

Rat swarms are commonly found in abandoned granaries, catacombs, graveyards, sewers, and other
indoor or subterranean environments with ample food for the rats.

###### Spoils

Rat swarms do not yield any spoils except meat.

###### Encounter

Running below the terrain here is an extensive burrow of 2”-3” diameter tunnels. A 6”-wide rat
hole, spotted as a secret door due to its covering of plant mulch and debris, is the primary
entrance to the burrow; two smaller 3” rat holes, separated by about 300’, serve as secondary exits.
The burrow is the den of **seven rat swarms.** The rats are unlikely to exit their burrow en masse
unless provoked or smoked out.
