### Dragon Turtle

This massive beast has the arms, legs, head, and tail of a dragon with the torso and shell of a
turtle. The dragon turtle’s rough, deep green shell is much the same color as the deep water the
monster favors, and the silver highlights that line the shell resemble light dancing on open water.
The turtle’s legs, tail, and head are a lighter green, flecked with golden highlights. A full-grown
dragon turtle measures about 130’ in shell diameter and weighs about 115,000 lbs. They can speak
Draconic, though true dragons consider their accent crass.

###### Combat

Dragon turtles have **acute olfaction** that grants them a +1 bonus to avoid surprise in their
natural habitat. Their **aquatic mechanoreception** enables them to “see” in water up to 270’ by
sensing changes in water current and water pressure. Spells or effects that would ordinarily cause
blindness do not affect the dragon turtle while it is using aquatic mechanoreception. However,
creatures that are not in the water are invisible to the sense. Aquatic mechanoreception does not
penetrate structures or terrain features.

Dragon turtles are **highly aggressive** (-3 penalty to reaction rolls) and frequently sink ships
sailing across their territory. They can attack with their powerful claw and bite or with their
**breath weapon**, a hot blistering cloud of steam 90’ long and 30’ wide that deals 36d6 {F!}damage
to all creatures in its area of effect, or half that on a successful Blast save.

###### Ecology

Dragon turtles make their lairs in submerged caverns deep under the water, where they hoard wealth
from ships that have sunk to the bottom of the sea.

Dragon turtles mate only a few times per century, but a dragon turtle egg can take almost a decade
to hatch. When a dragon turtle is encountered in its lair, there is a 30% chance it will be a female
incubating 1d2 eggs. Dragon turtle eggs have 40 hp and weigh a titanic 200 st. When a dragon turtle
egg hatches, the emerging spawn is driven off by its parent immediately to avoid competition for
food. Fortunately, the spawn (at AC 9 and 18 HD) is already incredibly powerful and more than
capable of fending for itself.

###### Spoils

A slain dragon turtle can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for
the following components useful in magic research:

* beak (53 2/6 st, 3,200gp, *dismember, sharpness, swift strike,* weapon +4)
* lungs (53 2/6 st, 3,200gp*, cone of frost, swimming, water breathing*)
* shell-plates (51 4/6 st, 3,100gp, *capsizing wave, cataclysm, level water,* armor +4)

Each of a dragon turtle's two horns fetch 2d6 x 250gp and weigh 1 st per 80gp value. A dragon
turtle’s armored hide fetches 17,000gp and weighs 305 st.
