### Blob, Black

The dreaded black blob is a giant amoeba resembling a gooey mound of congealed pudding around 4’
tall, 20’ in diameter and 50,000 lbs in weight. Mindless and all-devouring, a black blob oozes
through its environment to consume everything in its path. It can move along floors, walls, and
ceilings with equal ease, undulate through water, and can ooze through tiny fissures in stone or
narrow gaps in doorways.

###### Combat

Black blobs have **terrestrial mechanoreception** enabling them to sense vibration in the ground
over long distances equivalent to line of sight in full daylight. However, creatures that are
flying, levitating, or otherwise not touching the ground are invisible to the sense.

A black blob is immune to enchantment effects and to acidic, arcane, bludgeoning, cold, electrical,
luminous, necrotic, piercing, poisonous, seismic, and slashing damage. Only fire can truly harm a
black blob, but certain other damage types can affect it temporarily:

* If hit with cold damage, the black blob will be **paralyzed** for one round per die of damage the
attack would normally deal.
* If hit by electrical or seismic damage, the black blob will be blown apart and seemingly
destroyed, only to reform unharmed at the start of its next initiative.
* If hit with slashing damage, the black blob will be split into two smaller blobs. The Judge can
divide the original black blob’s Hit Dice and current hp between the two however he sees fit, with
the limitation that no black blob can have fewer than 2 Hit Dice. A blob with 2 – 4 HD only deals
1d8 damage, while a blob with 5 – 7 HD deals 2d8. A black blob of 2 HD treats slashing damage as
seismic damage. The black blobs can congeal back into one blob as a full-round action. Blobs that
congeal add their current hp together.

A black blob deals {A!} damage that can digest both metal and wood, but not stone. Any creature
reduced to 0 hp or fewer by a black blob is immediately slain and its body dissolved.

###### Ecology

Black blobs can be found anywhere there is organic matter for them to feed on, but are most common
in stone dungeons, whose confines become their feeding grounds.

A black blob reproduces by budding, detaching a newborn black blip (baby) each time it consumes
50,000 lbs of organic matter.

###### Spoils

A slain black blob can be harvested with the Alchemy proficiency for the following component:

* Burnt remnants (37 3/6 st, 2250gp, *disintegration, energy invulnerability* *(all except fire),
physical* invulnerability (all))
