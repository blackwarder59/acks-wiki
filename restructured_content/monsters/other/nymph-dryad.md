### Nymph, Dryad

Shy, intelligent, and resolute, dryads are a race of nymphs as elusive as they are alluring. The
dryad’s delicate features resemble those of a beautiful elven woman, though her flesh is the color
of bark, and her hair is the color of a canopy of leaves that changes color with the seasons.

Dryads are found in the forests of southern Aurëpos, particularly in Nicea, Krysea, Southern
Argollë, and Tirenea. They are very rare in the north, where faeries rather than nymphs reign.

Perhaps because their first interaction with mankind came in Nicea, most dryads speak Classical
Nicean as well as the local dialect of their region. They do not have their own language.

###### Combat

Each dryad is **spiritually united** with a particular tree, and lives her life in or near it. As
an action in lieu of moving, a dryad can disappear into her tree by touching it; while within her
tree, the dryad cannot be harmed, though her tree can be. She can take one small or man-sized
creature into her tree with her, if desired. If a dryad is ever more than 720’ from her tree, she
loses 1d3 hp per round until she dies or moves back in range. If a dryad’s tree dies, the dryad will
die with it.

A dryad can use **bewitch humanoid**at will as a spell-like ability. The effect is identical to
that of the spell except that it has a duration of 12 months. They will use this ability to defend
their trees from aggressors and, occasionally, to find mates.

If a dryad successfully bewitchesan elven or human man with a CHA score of 16+, the dryad will
beckon the hapless victim to join her at her tree. Once the bewitched fool is within 5’, the dryad
will disappear into her tree, taking him with her. Such men are never seen again. Not even a
*miracle* or *wish* can rescue the victim. (Perhaps he doesn’t want to be rescued?)

###### Ecology

Since dryads never stray from their tree, the lair roll actually determines whether the dryad
dwells alone or dwells in a grove with other dryads. Groves of dryads often accumulate treasure from
past victims or infatuations, and store underground below the tree’s roots.

The trees of dryads reproduce according to their nature, dropping seeds that are carried off by
wind and water. However, not every tree born of these seeds gives birth to a dryad; only if the
dryad has bewitched a mate will the new sapling contain a new dryad’s spirit. The young dryads that
dwell in such saplings are rarely seen, as they stay in their trees.

###### Spoils

A dryad corpse can be harvested with Healing 1 for the following components useful in magic
research:

* hair (2/6 st, 15gp, *allure, bewitch humanoid, enslave humanoid*)
* heartwood (2/6 st, 15gp, *plant growth, speak with plants*)
