### Crocodile, Giant

The giant crocodile is a prehistoric monstrosities about 40’ long and weigh about 9 tons. They
haunt the swamps and rivers of the Ivory Kingdoms, where they spend most of their time submerged
waiting for prey to come within reach.

###### Combat

Large crocodiles have **acute olfaction** and gain a +1 bonus to avoid surprise in its natural
habitat. They are **naturally stealthy** when submerged, and creatures encountering them suffer a -2
penalty to surprise rolls.

###### Ecology

When giant crocodiles are encountered in the wilderness, there is a 12% chance per crocodile that
it will have 5d10 eggs buried nearby. Giant crocodile eggs have 1 hp and weigh 3/6 st.

###### Spoils

A slain giant crocodile can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for
the following component:

* skull (30 st, 1,800gp, *dismember, swimming,* armor +3, weapon +3)

A giant crocodile's armored hide fetches 800gp and weighs 47 stone.

Like their smaller siblings, giant crocodiles are both dull-witted and ill-tempered, making them
difficult to train.

###### Lore

*5th Juselen 381. The* Triton’s Wake *has docked at Modishu, trading port on the east coast of
Ulruk. The quartermaster and I disembarked to assess arbitrage opportunities.*

*6th Juselen 381. The quartermaster has persuaded me that the trade in exotic animals represents
the best opportunity for profit. We have meetings with the Guild of Beastmongers tomorrow morning.*

*7th Juselen 381. At a cost of 2,440gp we have secured a remarkable specimen of crocodile from the
Beastmongers’ Guild. The monstrosity measures 39’ from nose to tail and weighs almost 1,800 stone.
The sailors have named it “Skara”.*

*10th Juselen 381. I sadly record the death of one of our most able mariners, Pylos Dor. His leg
was torn off by Skara during feeding, and the ship’s chirugeon was unable to save his life.*

*12th Juselen 381. The* Triton’s Wake *has arrived at Arganos, capital of Southern Argollë. The
quartermaster has arranged a meeting for tomorrow with a lanista from Cyfaraun who is interested in
purchasing the specimen.*

*13th Juselen 381. After heated negotiation, Lanista Celictor Nuvicus has agreed to pay 2,860gp for
ownership of the crocodile. Transport to Cyfaraun will be by river.*
