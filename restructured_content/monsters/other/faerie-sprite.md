### Faerie, Sprite

Sprites are reclusive fey creatures that appear as 1' tall winged elves. They delight in dancing
and frolicking and giggle as often as they speak. Sprites are not malicious, but are mischievous,
and enjoy playing tricks on other creatures.

Like other faeries, sprites are found primarily in northern Aurëpos, particularly in Northern
Argollë, Jutland, and Rorn. Though some dwell in Southern Argollë, they are otherwise very rare in
the south, where nymphs rather than faeries are found.

Sprites speak the lilting language of faeries and the languages spoken by gnomes, halflings, and
humans of their region.

###### Combat

Every sprite can use *bestow curse* as a spell-like ability once per day. The curse will never
cause physical harm or illness, but will instead be embarrassing or humorous. The Judge can roll
1d10 on the Sprite Curse table or devise their own.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Roll (1d10) | Curse |
| 1 | Skin becomes dotted or striped |
| 2 | Ears grow into donkey ears |
| 3 | Voice transform into that of a little girl |
| 4 | Suffers hair loss in an embarrassing pattern |
| 5 | Must always tell the truth no matter what |
| 6 | Speaks all his words and sentences backward |
| 7 | Develops a speech impediment (lisp, etc) |
| 8 | Randomly punctuates speech with profanity |
| 9 | Becomes obsessed with counting things |
| 10 | Thinks he is a vampire, fears daylight, garlic |

The curse lasts indefinitely until cured with *remove curse*, the sprite stops sustaining the
curse, or the sprite sustaining it is slain.

Sprites do not carry weapons or fight. If attacked, they will scatter in flight to hide.

###### Ecology

Sprites dwell in tiny smials (civilized burrows) that resemble those of halflings. However, the
structure of the smials never quite makes sense, as if it were built in imitation of the appearance
without an understanding of the function. They have doors that do not open, staircases that lead
nowhere, etc.

They reproduce by transforming abandoned, orphaned, and/or unloved gnomish or halfling children
into their own kind in magic rituals performed in places of power on holy days. The children
remember their old life dimly as if a dream, which fades with time.

They never steal children from loving parents. Nevertheless, gnomish and halfling mothers
frequently warn naughty toddlers that they’ll be carried off by the sprites if they misbehave.
