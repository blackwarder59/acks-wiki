### Worm, Giant Grey

Giant grey worms are huge annelids, though not so large as black worms. They can grow to 30’ in
length, 4’ in diameter, and 2,700lbs in weight. Their segmented bodies range in color from bone
white to dark grey.

###### Combat

If a grey worm succeeds on a bite attack against a creature of man size or less with an unmodified
throw of 20, it can **swallow** the creature. The swallowed creature suffers 2d6 {A!} damage at the
start of its initiative each round. If the swallowed creature has a tiny, small, or natural piercing
or slashing weapon, it can attack the worm from inside its belly with an attack penalty of -4.
Should the swallowed creature die and remain in the worm’s belly for 6 turns, it is irrecoverably
digested. The worm can cleave after swallowing a creature.

In addition to burrowing through loose earth, soil, and sand, a grey worm can burrow through hard
stone by dealing structural damage with its bite. The worm can deal 1 {B} structural damage per
bite. A 30’ long 3’ diameter cylinder of stone has 20 shp, so it takes a white worm about 20 rounds
(2 turns) to advance 30’ through stone.

###### Ecology

When a wilderness nest of giant grey worms is encountered, there is a 30% chance per worm that it
will have recently buried 1d6 eggs nearby. The eggs have 1 hp and weigh 3/6 st. Worm spawn disperse
after birth and are not found in the den.

###### Spoils

Because of their propensity to swallow creatures whole, an encounter with grey worms can yield
treasure even though the creature has no lair. The treasure (if any) is always found inside the
creatures’ bellies.

A slain grey worm can be harvested with Animal Husbandry 2 for the following components useful in
magic research:

* gizzard (4 3/6 st, 270gp, *circle of agony, locate treasure*)
* mandibles (5 st, 300gp, *create chasm, earth's teeth, earth’s movement, passageway*)

If not used for magic research, a grey worm’s mandibles fetch 18gp and weigh 2/6 st.

###### Encounter

The ground ahead has collapsed. The fallen rubble forms an easily-traversable slope down into a
braided maze of lava-tube passages running just below the surface. The black passages are about 7’
in diameter, with ceilings decorated by dripping stalactites that look like the polyps of an
underwater creature. Here and there, the polyps have been broken off by the passage of some
underground traveler. The lava tubes are the nest of **two giant grey worms.**
