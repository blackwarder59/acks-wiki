### Triton

Tritons, or mermen, have the bodies of muscular humans from the waist up and the tails of sea-fish
from the waist down. The tritons that live in the Ammas Aurë have pale skin with a light grey
undertone, blue or hazel eyes, and black, navy blue, or sea green hair. Occasionally a triton may
have bright red hair. Tritons measure about 8’ long and weigh about 400 lbs.

Commoners who dwell in the interior of Aurëpos think tritons are merely legends or fairy tales, but
those who fish and sail the seas know them to be real, though reclusive, creatures. From time to
time, when tritons need something from the surface world, they will swim to a village shore or come
alongside a ship and offer to trade the bounty of the sea bounty in exchange for whatever good or
service they need.

Tritons have their own language. About 75% of tritons speak one additional langue, usually the
human or demi-human tongue spoken at the nearest settlement to their village.

###### Combat

Tritons have a lateral line system through their fish tails that affords them **aquatic
mechanoreception** to a range of 60’. Those fish tails also provide **natural scale armor** that
grants a +3 bonus to AC. Only champions and chiefs wear additional protection.

However, like humans, tritons arm themselves with weapons to hunt and fight. 50% of triton warriors
will be armed with harpoon (treat as spear) and short sword. The other 50% will be armed with
trident (treat as pole arm) and dagger.

###### Ecology

Triton villages are found only in great lakes, seas, and oceans. Most of their villages are deep
underwater, but occasionally some are close to the surface for ease of hunting or trade. Triton
bands can range far from their undersea homes.

Each band of triton will be led by a champion with 4 AC, 2 HD, and a +1 damage bonus. A triton
village will be led by a chief with AC 6, 4 HD, and a +2 damage bonus. There is a 70% chance the
village will be protected by trained giant fish. Roll 1d4 to determine the type and number: 1, 2d6+1
giant catfish; 2, 5d6 giant piranha; 3, 3d6 giant rockfish; 4, 1d10 giant sturgeon.

Triton villages will have tritones (often called mermaids) and eggs equal to 100% and 200% of the
number of males each. Tritones have AC 2, HD ½, and attack with 1 dagger at 12+ (1d4). Tritones
defending their eggs do not have to make morale rolls; they always fight to the death.

###### Spoils

A slain triton can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 2 for the following components
useful in magic research:
