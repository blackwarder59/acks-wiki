### Statue, Animated Iron

Statues of various materials can be made into constructs by powerful spellcasters. As no natural
fire in Aurëpos can burn hot enough to cast iron, animated iron statues are actually built with
wooden frames that are set with thin iron plates, hammered into shape and riveted to the frame. They
usually resemble 6’ warriors in lamellar or plate armor. They weigh around 1,275 lbs.

###### Combat

Unless they engage in some form of movement, animated iron statues appear to be normal statues even
upon close inspection. Characters encountering stationary animated statues suffer a -2 penalty to
surprise rolls.

In combat, animated iron statues strike with their fists for 1d8 {B} damage. Some iron statutes
might be constructed with weapons in their hands, dealing 1d8 {W} damage.

Animated iron statues can have a **magnetic effect** on metal weapons. When an attack damages an
animated iron statue with non-magical metal weapons, the attacker must make a Spells saving throw.
If the throw fails, the weapon becomes lodged on the statue. A lodged weapon can only be retrieved
by destroying the statue. If the save succeeds, the attacker retains his weapon.

Animated iron statues are **immune** to enchantment effects, necrotic damage, and poisonous damage.
As constructs, they count as enchanted creatures for purposes of spells such as *dispel evil*and
*holy circle*.

###### Ecology

As constructs, animated iron statues have no natural habitat. They can be found guarding ancient
treasures, dwarven vaults, or places of power or serving powerful spellcasters.

###### Spoils

A destroyed iron statue can be harvested with Magical Engineering for the following component
useful in magic research:

* iron head (2 2/6 st, 135gp, *deflect ordinary weapons, shatter blade*)

###### Encounter

An 100’ long, 80’ wide oval-shaped expanse of flat, level ground sits at the base of a series of
grassy terraces that descend like steps from a height of some 30’. The ground of the oval expanse is
overgrown with grass and shrubs, but here and there can be seen the glint of metal amongst the
vegetation. In the middle of the oval stands an iron statue of a gladiator wearing heavy arena
armor, heavy helmet, a pair of short swords. The statue looks heavily damaged.

The oval expense was once a gladiatorial arena and the grassy terraces are the remains of the stone
seats that encircled it. The gladiator in the middle of the arena is an **animated iron statue**. It
attacks any creature that attacks it or that carries weapons into the arena**.**
