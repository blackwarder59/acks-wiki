### Bronze Bull

A bronze bull is a powerful construct resembling a giant horned bull with a brazen hide and iron
horns. Within its interior burns a furnace of elemental fire. Whisps of smoke continuously trail
from its brazen nostrils, and from its mouth belches blazing and terrible fire. Standing over 7'
tall at the shoulder and measuring 9' from snout to tail, the bronze bull weighs about 10,000lb.

###### Combat

In combat, a bronze bull can gore targets with its horns for 5d6 {P!} damage or use its **fire
breath**. The fire breath forms a cone 60' long and 30' wide at its terminal end. Each creature
within the cone must make a Blast saving throw. If the save fails, the creature suffers 10d6 {F!}
damage. If the save succeeds, the creature suffers half that damage. After breathing fire, the
bronze bull’s furnace is temporarily dimmed. It takes 1d6 rounds before the furnace re-heats
sufficiently to allow it to breath fire again.

A bronze bull is **immune** to enchantment effects and to fire, necrotic, and poisonous damage. If
the bronze bull suffers piercing or slashing damage in melee, the creature that dealt the damage
must make a Blast saving throw. If the save succeeds, there is no effect. If the save fails, the
creature suffers 1d6 {F!} damage as some of the **elemental fire** within the bull gushes over it.

As constructs, bronze bulls count as enchanted creatures for purposes of spells such as *dispel
evil*and *holy circle*.

###### Ecology

As magical constructs, bronze bulls have no natural habitat. They are usually constructed as beasts
of burden or war-mounts for powerful spellcasters.

###### Spoils

A destroyed bronze bull can be harvested with Magical Engineering for the following component:

* bronze hooves (37 3/6 st., 2,250gp, any elemental fire effect, armor +2)

A bronze bull’s two horns each fetch 1d10x50gp and weigh 1 st per 60gp value.

###### Lore

*Now Aenon, having saddled the winged pegasus and calmed the raging chimera, became acclaimed as
the finest tamer of animals in all Nicea. Queen Jocia, seeing the rising fame of Aenon, knew him as
a threat to her rule; and so she demanded that he prove his prowess by yoking her untamable
bronze-hooved bulls. These were no ordinary bulls, but rather immense brazen beasts which belched
all-consuming fire.*

*Had Aenon approached the bulls unprepared, he surely would have been sent to a fiery grave; but
just before the moment of his approach, he rubbed an oil on his shield, spear, and body, which the
magi Nicodos had promised would make him invulnerable to the bull’s fire…*

* Thalosides, *Mythos*
