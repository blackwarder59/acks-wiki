### Vampire Thrall

Any character of 8 HD or less slain by a vampire’s bite attack will return from death in three days
as a vampire thrall. (Those with 9 HD or more return as vampires.) A thrall resembles an ordinary
human with very pale skin and slightly elongated canine teeth. A vampire thrall is utterly
**enslaved** to the will of the vampire that created him, becoming free willed only if his master is
killed. A vampire thrall possesses some, but not all, of the characteristics and powers of a
vampire. A thrall’s characteristics depend on its HD, as shown on the tables below. Vampire thralls
of 3 HD or less deal mundane damage while those of 4 HD or more deal extraordinary damage.

components.
