### Golem, Bone

These man-sized four-armed skeletal warriors are frequently mistaken for undead, but they are
actually magical constructs. Creating one involves the employment of mighty magic by exceptionally
powerful spellcasters.

Like most constructs, bone golems have no true intelligence. The magic that animates them imbues
them with just enough sapience to follow simple or standing orders from their creators.

###### Combat

When encountered, a bone golem’s reactions are always determined by its creator’s orders (even if
given long, long ago).

Bone golems are always constructed with four arms, and each can attack with a weapon every round.
Bone golems are **immune** to enchantment effects; cold, electrical, fire, necrotic, and poisonous
damage; and to all mundane damage.

###### Ecology

As constructs, bone golems have no natural habitat. They can be found guarding ancient treasures,
dwarven vaults, or places of power or serving powerful spellcasters.

###### Spoils

A destroyed bone golem can be harvested with Magical Engineering for the following component:

* skull (26 4/6 st, 1,600gp, *barrier of blades, energy protection (cold, electrical, fire), energy
invulnerability (cold, electrical, fire),* *physical protection (all), swift sword,* armor +2)

###### Encounter

A cave mouth yawns open on a nearby hillside. The mouth’s rim is adorned with the skulls of
thick-browed humanoids, yellowed and pitted with great age. Inside, the walls are carved with a
sequence of ancient cave paintings involving burial of the dead, the exhumation of their bones, and
a witch-doctor or shaman undertaking a religious or magical ritual over the bones. The **bone
golem** created by this ritual still dwells within the cave, though it has not stirred in millennia.

**Bone golem:** Spd 120’, AC 7, HD 8\*\*, hp 42, #AT 4 (flint swords 3+), Dmg 1d6 {S!}, Save F4, ML
N/A, XP 1,600

The bone golem dangles with 12 ornamental bone and scrimshaw amulets, fetishes, and charms (30gp
each). On its bony brow it wears a carved jade circlet (1,000gp).
