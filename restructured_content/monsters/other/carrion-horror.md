### Carrion Horror

The carrion horror is a 4' tall and 9' long giant scolopendrine that resembles a huge centipede
with multifaceted eyes, dozens of tiny legs, and an oversized head bearing eight 2' feelers tipped
with venomous stingers. The origin of these creatures is unknown, for even the cultists of Iskara
deny that the Mother of Monsters would make such an abomination.

###### Combat

Carrion horrors have **terrestrial mechanoreception** enabling them to sense vibration in the
ground over long distances equivalent to line of sight in full daylight. Spells or effects that
would ordinarily cause blindness do not affect the creature when using terrestrial mechanoreception.
However, creatures that are flying, levitating, or otherwise not touching the ground are invisible
to the sense. Terrestrial mechanoreception can penetrate structures and terrain features.

If a carrion horror damages a creature with a stinger, the creature must make a Paralysis save
against its venom. If the save succeeds, the creature is unaffected by the poison. If the save
fails, the creature is **paralyzed** at the end of the carrion horror’s initiative. A carrion
horror’s paralysis can be cured with *cure injury* or *neutralize poison.* Otherwise, it lasts for
2d4 turns.

The carrion horror can instinctively identify when its venom has paralyzed a creature, enabling it
to continue to attack an opponent that resists its venom or turn its attention to other threats if
it succumbs.

If not engaged by another opponent, a carcass scavenger can devour a paralyzed creature of man-size
or less as its combat action. Devoured creatures are instantly slain.

###### Ecology

When a nest of carrion horrors is encountered, there is a 7% chance per horror that it will be
incubating a clutch of 1d10 eggs. The eggs have 1 hp and weigh 1/6 st. Carrion horror hatchlings are
rarely found in nests, because the hatchlings immediately disperse into the wild after they emerge
from their eggs.

###### Spoils

A slain carrion horror can be harvested with Animal Husbandry 2 for the following components useful
in magic research:

* feelers (1 1/6 st, 70gp, *swift sword*)
* stinger tips (1 4/6 st, 100gp, *halt humanoid, halt monster*

If not used for magic research, a carrion horror’s eight stingers fetch 1gp and weigh 1/6 st each.
Its venom (onset time 1 turn, +2 saving throw modifier, inflicts paralysis for 2d4 turns) fetches
300gp and weighs 1/6 st.
