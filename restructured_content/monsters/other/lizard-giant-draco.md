### Lizard, Giant Draco

The giant draco measures about 6’ long and weighs about 170 lbs. It has large skin flaps below its
limbs that make it capable of gliding in the air.

The sages of the Tower of Knowledge believe that the giant draco, as well as the other species of
giant lizards, were bred from ordinary lizards as fighting beasts and pets by the ancient
Thrassians.

Whatever their origin, they are now widespread throughout the known world. They are particularly
commonly in the jungles of Somirea and Ulruk, but have also been known to take up residence in warm,
humid caves and dungeons.

###### Combat

Giant draco lizards prefer to attack from above. They are also **skilled climbers** able to ascend
sheer surfaces as if they were thieves (6+). Once they have perched on a high branch or rocky
outcropping, they wait for prey to pass by, then glide down and snatch it.

###### Ecology

When a wilderness lair of giant geckos is encountered, there is a 25% chance per lizard that it
will have buried a clutch of 1d4+1 eggs nearby. The eggs have 1 hp and weight 1/6 st. Draco
hatchlings are rarely found in nests, because the creatures immediately disperse into the wild after
they emerge from their eggs.

###### Spoils

A slain giant draco can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the
following component:

* wings (2 2/6 st, 140gp, *leaping,* armor +1)

From time to time, enterprising adventurers attempt to capture and rear giant draco lizards. The
creatures are as stupid and surly as all giant lizards, but have the benefit of a short life cycle.

###### Encounter

Overlooking a small forest is a large rocky outcropping extending over 50' into the air. Basking on
this rock, but hidden from below, are **five giant draco lizards**. In the forest undergrowth below
the outcropping, the lizards have buried **eleven draco eggs**. If the eggs are threatened, the
giant draco lizards will swoop down and attack.
