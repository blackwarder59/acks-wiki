### Leech, Giant

Giant leeches are parasitic segmented worms measuring 4' long and weighing as much as 215 lbs.
Brown, slimy, and repulsive, they live exclusively in marshy terrain and other bodies of stagnant
water. Giant leeches are nearly mindless and exist only to feed and reproduce. A full-grown leech
can suck a man dry of blood within less than a minute.

###### Combat

Small hair-like sensilla distributed across a giant leech’s body grant it **aquatic
mechanoreception**. The leech can sense changes in water current and water pressure to a range of
60’. Spells or effects that would ordinarily cause *blindness* do not affect a monster using aquatic
mechanoreception. However, creatures that are not in the water are invisible to them. Aquatic
mechanoreception does not penetrate structures or terrain features.

When a giant leech senses a living creature in range, it attacks with its proboscis for 3d6 {P!}
damage. If the leech damages the target with its proboscis, the leech latches onto the target and
begins **drinking blood**. Once latched on, the leach can use its combat action to automatically
deal another 3d6 {N!} damage to the creature each round.

Creatures that are having their blood drunk by a leech can still move, but count as carrying an
extra 21 stone of encumbrance. The giant leech moves with the creature it is latched onto. A giant
leech will remain attached to a target until the target dies or the leach is killed.

###### Ecology

Giant leeches are hermaphroditic and can either self-fertilize or engage in reciprocal
fertilization with another giant leech. In either case, the giant leech will wrap its eggs in a
cocoon, which they carry on their bodies until the eggs hatch.

When giant leeches are encountered, there is a 20% chance per leech that it will be carrying a
cocoon of 1d4 eggs. The eggs have 1 hp and weight 1/60 st. Leech larvae immediately disperse into
the wild after they emerge from their eggs.

###### Spoils

A slain giant leech can be harvested with Animal Husbandry 2 for the following components useful in
magic research:

* sucker (6 4/6 st, 400gp, *cause injury, life transfer*)
* salivary gland (4 3/6 st, 270gp, *cure injury, salving rest*)
