### Snake, Giant Constricting Viper

The giant constricting viper is a primeval serpent that can grow to be up to 50’ long, with a head
the size of a horse’s skull and a girth as tall as a man. They are native only to the wild jungles
of Ulruk. However, their size and power makes them attractive to cultists, sorcerers, and other dark
personalities, so tamed or charmed specimens can sometimes be found in dungeons, temples, and tombs.

###### Combat

Giant constricting vipers have **acute olfaction** that grants them a +1 bonus to avoid surprise in
their natural habitat. Unlike most animals, they can “see” the heat of living creatures, granting
them **lightless vision** to a range of 60’.

A giant constricting viper attacks with a **venomous** bite that deals 3d6 {P!} damage. Any
creature damaged by its bite must make a Death saving throw. If the save fails, the creature is
immediately **maddened** by pain. If the venom is not neutralized, the creature will die 1d4+2 turns
later.

When the viper successfully bites a creature, it automatically constricts the creature for 5d6 {B!}
damage and **restrains** it. If the viper misses its bite, it can separately attack by constriction.
Once a creature has been restrained, the viper can automatically deal 5d6 {B!} damage on its
initiative each round to the restrained creature without having to make an attack throw. Doing so
counts as the python’s constriction attack.

###### Ecology

While giant constricting vipers sometimes congregate in dens during brumation or breeding season,
they do not exhibit any parental care for their offspring. Their young are born fully formed with
functional venom glands. The precocious snakelets quickly disperse after birth.

###### Spoils

A slain giant constricting viper can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or
Trapping for the following components useful in magic research:

* fangs (11 4/6 st., 700gp, *neutralize poison, poison*)
* spine (11 4/6 st., 700gp, *choking grip, iron maiden*)
* tongue (11 4/6 st., 700gp, *staffs to snakes, snakes to staffs*)

If not used for magic research, a giant constricting viper’s fangs fetch 18gp and weigh 2/6 st. Its
venom (onset time instant / 1d4+2 turns, no saving modifier, **madness**/death on failed Death
saving throw) fetches 1,000gp and weighs 1/6 st.

Giant constricting vipers have a wicked cunning that makes them capable of being trained as guards,
but they are foul-tempered and hard to handle.
