### Ostrich

The ostrich is a large flightless bird that stands around 8’ tall and weighs around 275 lbs. Its
plumage is predominantly black with striking white plumes on the wings and tail. They are curious,
playful creatures but can be highly territorial and aggressive towards perceived intruders.

Ostriches are most common in the savannas of Ulruk, but can also be found in the southern reaches
of the Sunset Kingdoms and the Zaharan Waste.

###### Combat

Ostriches have strong kicks capable of injuring or killing lions and hyenas, but their beaks are
adapted for grasping and swallowing rather than fight.

###### Ecology

When an ostrich nest is encountered, there is a 25% chance each ostrich is rearing offspring. If
so, roll 1d4 for age and number: 1, it’s 1d6+5 eggs; 3-8 it’s 1d4+1 juveniles. Juvenile ostriches
have AC 2, Spd 210’, 2+1 HD, and attack with 2 kicks (1d2 {B}). Eggs have 1 hp and weigh 2/6 st.

###### Spoils

A slain ostrich with extraordinary characteristics can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor
(Butchery) for the following components useful in magic research:

* talons (1 st., 65gp, *avian messenger, swift sword*)

An ostrich’s 6d10 flight feathers each fetch 1d3sp and weigh 1/150 st.

Ostriches can be tamed and trained as hunters, but few trainers find it worthwhile since they are
not large enough to serve as mounts. Rumors that a tribe of halflings native to the Ivory Kingdoms
has domesticated the ostrich are not considered credible by the Tower of Knowledge.

###### Encounter

The high grass of the savanna conceals a communal nest of **four ostriches**. The flock’s male has
dug a hole for his mates to lay their eggs in, where the females take turns incubating the **15
eggs**. The ostriches have no treasure.

**Ostriches (4):** Speed 240’, AC 3, HD 3+2\*, hp 20, 16, 14, 10, #AT 2 (talons 7+), Dmg 1d4 {S}
/1d4 {S}, Save F2, ML 0, XP 65
