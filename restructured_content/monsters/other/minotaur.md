### Minotaur

These monstrous humanoids have the torsos of huge, muscled men and the heads of horned bulls. Some
minotaurs have more bullish ancestry, with bovine legs, hooves, and fur, while others are more
human, with the legs, feet, and hair of men. Whatever its ancestry, a typical minotaur stands 9’
tall and weighs 700 lbs.

Most Auran sages believe that minotaurs are magical crossbreeds, but the Zaharan myths claim that
the minotaurs are the mortal descendants of Nargund, the Beast Lord, Chthonic god of hunting and
predation. What is certain is that minotaurs delight in the thrill of hunting human beings.
Minotaurs virtually always slay and eat the men they hunt, but they have been known to abduct and
carry off young women, taking them back to their lairs for terrible consortium.

Minotaurs speak their own language, an archaic offshoot of Classical Nicean. They have a 50% chance
of speaking a beastman tongue and 25% chance of speaking Common.

###### Combat

Minotaurs have **acute olfaction** granting them a +1 bonus to avoid surprise in their natural
habitat. They can track the scent of creatures for up to 6 miles with the equivalent of three ranks
of Tracking proficiency. Minotaurs are relentless and, unless they fail a morale roll, will
inexorably chase fleeing prey, tracking enemies that they lose sight.

In combat, minotaurs can attack with a weapon or bite and gore with their horns. Due to their
**monstrous prowess**, they deal extraordinary damage and gain a +3 damage bonus with weapons.
Minotaurs generally favor great axes, morning stars, or pole arms. They wear little clothing,
perhaps a loincloth or leather trousers with sandals, but their **thick skin** grants a +3 bonus to
AC.

###### Ecology

Most minotaurs dwell in dungeons, where they can prey upon anyone who ventures within, but
sometimes they establish crude settlements in abandoned ruins or desolate regions of wilderness.

Since all minotaurs are male, they reproduce by mating with either cows or human women. Half the
offspring of such unholy unions are deformed monstrosities that die shortly after the birth; the
other half are minotaurs babies. When encountered in a wilderness lair, there is a 25% chance there
will be 2d3 captive human women and/or cows, 1d2 baby minotaurs, and 1d4 juvenile minotaurs.
Juvenile minotaurs have AC 1, Spd 90’, HD 3, and attack with gore (1d4 {P}) and bite (1d4 {P}). Baby
minotaurs have AC 0, Spd 90’, HD 2, and attack with gore (1d3 {P}) and bite (1d3 {P}). The captive
human women are noncombatants with AC 0, Spd 120’, 1 hp, ML -4, who do not fight. Cows are 3 HD Herd
Animals (p. XX).

###### Spoils
