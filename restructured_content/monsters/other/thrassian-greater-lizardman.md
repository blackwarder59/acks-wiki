### Thrassian (Greater Lizardman)

Thrassians stand 7’ to 8’ tall, resembling massive lizardmen with large heads characterized by
prominent and protruding fangs and glowing yellow eyes. Dragon-like wings erupt from their shoulder
blades, giving them crude flight capabilities.

Magically bred from a cross of men and giant lizards long ago by unknown arcanists, the Thrassians
once held much of Aurëpos and Ulruk in their scaly claws. Such was their power that primitive man
worshiped them as gods and served them as slaves. Yet from this height, the Thrassian people fell to
abyssal lows. Some taint in the Thrassian bloodline caused them to slowly degenerate into primitive
savagery. Had they been kinder to their subject peoples, the Thrassians might have slipped into
obscurity peacefully. Instead, they were violently overthrown by the Zaharans, who seized power from
their former masters and formed their own dark empire.

Of the handful of Thrassians that survived the Zaharan uprising, most fled to the outlying swamps
and jungles, where they continued their devolution to the primitive lizardmen of today. The few true
Thrassians that presently exist are slaves sorcerously bred for the amusement of Kemeshi nobles. The
time of the Thrassians has passed.

Or has it? The lizardmen claim it is yet to come. Their scaly shamans teach that the greatest of
the Thrassian priest-kings escaped the wrath of the Zaharans, and even now slumbers in a hidden
vault; and that when he awakens, he shall stride forth with a legion of Thrassian warriors and lead
his children to restore the empire of old. The sages deem this a fable, merely the lizardmen’s
version of the Chthonic myth of the Awakening. If it were true, however, and one of the Thrassian
tyrants of old did return, then the shores of the Ammas Aurë would become an abattoir, as the
Thrassians avenged a thousand years of humiliation with blood and slaughter.

Thrassians speak their own language, known to humans as Ancient Thrassian, as well as the debased
dialect of Thrassian spoken by lizardmen. Thrassians have a 10% chance per HD of speaking Common or
another language used in their region.

###### Combat

Thrassians typically fight with their claws and fangs, but sometimes wield weapons, favoring
tridents (pole arms) for battlefield formations and javelins for aerial skirmishing. Their immense
strength grants them a +3 damage bonus. (This has already been factored into their natural attacks).
They typically wear partial leather or hide armor atop their thick, scaly hides.

###### Ecology

Thrassians are the natural leaders of lizardmen, and are rarely encountered without a substantial
force of followers and servants. A solitary Thrassian has a 75% chance to be guarded by 1d8
lizardman champions and 5d8 lizardman warriors. A Thrassian has a 10% chance of either shaman or
mage abilities at level 4.

When Thrassians are encountered in a dominion, there will be 1d8 lizardmen champions and 5d8
lizardman warriors serving *each* Thrassian. The Thrassians and their lizardmen followers will
collectively be led by a Thrassian dominator with 9 AC, 8+1 HD, 40 hp, and a +4 damage bonus (+2
with natural attacks).

A dominator will have either shaman (75%) or mage (25%) abilities at level 8. A dominator will
possess magic items in addition to any held by the dominion, as an 8th level NPC. As long as the
dominator is alive, the dominion’s members gain a +2 bonus to morale rolls.

Due to the degeneration of their species, only Thrassian dominators of the male sex remain fertile,
and even they cannot always reliably perpetuate their kind. Thrassian dominions will have 15
lizardman females and 15 eggs for every Thrassian. If properly tended, 5% of a dominion’s eggs will
hatch into Thrassians, 20% will hatch into lizardman champions, and the remaining 75% will hatch
into ordinary lizardmen.

According to legend, Thrassian dominators are themselves commanded by Thrassian tyrants, though
such a creature has not been seen in over a thousand years. If encountered, a tyrant has 10 AC, 11+1
HD, 55 hp, and a +5 damage bonus (+3 with natural attacks). All tyrants are spellcasters, with
either shaman (75%) or mage (25%) abilities at level 11. (Some tyrants achieved even greater power
as undead, after the flesh…) Like dominators, tyrants will possess magic items, as 11th level NPCs.

Thrassian tyrants who unite with lizardmen can reliably breed fertile Thrassians. Should a tyrant
emerge, the ancient and evil race could replenish its ranks.

###### Spoils

A slain Thrassian can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 2 for the following
component useful in magic research:

* eyes (1 1/6 st., 70gp, *dominate humanoid, lightless vision*)
* wings (1 1/6 st, 70gp, *ogre strength, winged flight*)

Leaders have more valuable components. The eyes and wings of Thrassian shamans fetch 112gp and
weigh 1 5/6 st each. The eyes and wings of Thrassian mages fetch 140gp and weigh 2 2/6 st each.
Dominator shamans have eyes and wings worth 550gp and weighing 9 1/6 st each. Dominator mages have
eyes and wings worth 800gp and weighing 13 2/6 st each. Tyrant shamans have eyes and wings worth
3,600gp and weighing 60 st. Tyrant mages have eyes and wings worth 5,200gp and weighing 86 4/6 st.

###### Lore

*The contrast between the High Thrassian civilization of antiquity and the primitive lizardmen of
our own day could not be greater. The lizardman is a naked savage, a wielder of sticks and stones,
living in rude huts in fetid swamps. The Thrassians donned resplendent armor, carried weapons of
bronze and iron, spoke a sophisticated tongue, and had mastered sorcery to an extent unmatched by
any empire before or since.*

*Today only their ruins linger on, crumbling temples and strange spires built by clawed hands, with
alien proportions not fit for warm-blooded life. Where did the Thrassians come from, and what
destroyed them?*

* *Megaravicos,* *Of the Reptiles and their Ways*
