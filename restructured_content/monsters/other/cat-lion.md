### Cat, Lion

Lions are powerful ambush predators that dwell in prides. They are found primarily in Kemesh,
Opelenea, Shebatea, and southern Krysea and Somirea, as well as Ulruk south of the Great Waste.
Lions are popular attractions at the arena and many are imported throughout the Auran Empire. Some
later escape or are bought as guards or hunt animals, so lions often appear well outside their
native habitats.

###### Combat

Lions have **acute hearing** and **acute olfaction.** They gain a +2 bonus to avoid surprise in
their natural habitat. They can track the scent of creatures for up to 4 miles with the equivalent
of two ranks of Tracking proficiency.

They are **quite agile** (as Acrobatics proficiency at 12+) and **good climbers**, able to ascend
sheer surfaces as if they were thieves (6+). Their **lightning reflexes** grant a +1 bonus to
initiative. They are **naturally stealthy** when in their native habitat, and creatures encountering
them suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls.

If a lion charges a creature or leaps over it (using Acrobatics), and successfully hits it with
both claws, it immediately **pounces** onthe creature. The lion’s subsequent bite attack
automatically hits and the creature that has been pounced on must make a successful size-adjusted
Paralysis saving throw or be knocked **prone**.

###### Ecology

When lions are encountered in a wilderness den, the lions will be rearing 1d4 juvenile lions and
2d4 baby lions. Juvenile lions have AC 1, Spd 150’, HD 2+2, and attack with 2 claws (1d2 {S}) and a
bite (1d4 {P}). Baby lions have AC 0, Spd 120’, HD 1+2, and attack with 2 scratches (1 {S}) and a
bite (1d2 {P}).

###### Spoils

A slain lion with exceptional attributes can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery)
or Trapping for the following components useful in magic research:

* heart (3 st, 175gp, *dominate beast, remove fear, silent step, swift sword*)
* tongue (3 st, 175gp, *call of the great cats*)

A lion’s pelt fetches 50gp and weighs 1 stone.

###### Encounter

Rising from the scrubland is a thousand-year old baobab tree, 72’ tall and 33’ in diameter. Large
grooves are cut into the tree’s wood, signs of territorial marking and claw sharpening. A hollow in
its great trunk serves as the den of a pride of great cats, including **seven lions**, **two cubs**
and **four** **baby cubs**. The cubs in the hollow are supervised by three adults; the other four
lions are hunting in the vicinity, each arriving 1d6 rounds after the pride’s den is attacked.
