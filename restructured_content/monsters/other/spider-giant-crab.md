### Spider, Giant Crab

Nasga, goddess of beauty and pain, bred the first giant spiders to help weave her web of suffering
across the world. They are found in desolate ruins, dungeons, and forsaken wilderness throughout
Aurëpos, Danae, and Ulruk.

The giant crab spider is a 5' long carnivorous arachnid that weighs about 125 lbs. They are ambush
predators that rely on their color-changing carapaces to surprise prey. Unlike black widows, they do
not weave webs.

###### Combat

Giant crab spiders are **naturally** stealthy in their natural habitat, and creatures encountering
them suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls.

Their bites carry a dangerous **venom.** A creature damaged by a giant crab spider’s bite must make
a Death saving throw with a +2 bonus. If the save fails, the creature dies of poison after 1d4 turns
have elapsed.

###### Ecology

When a wilderness den of giant crab spiders is encountered, there is a 5% chance per spider that it
will have constructed an egg sac containing 3d6 eggs. The eggs have 1 hp and weigh 1/30 st.
Spiderlings disperse after birth and are not found in the den.

###### Spoils

A giant crab spider monster corpse can be harvested with Animal Husbandry 2 for the following
components useful in magic research:

* mandibles (1/6 st, 10gp, *poison*)
* leg tarsus (1/6 st, 10gp, *spider climb*)
* palps (1/6 st, 9gp, *chameleon*)

If not used for magic research, a giant crab spider’s mandibles fetch 8gp and weigh 1/6 st. Its
venom (onset time 1d8 turns, +4 saving throw modifier, 2d6 poisonous damage on failed Death saving
throw) fetches 100gp and weighs 1/6 st.

Like all arachnids, giant crab spiders are cunning enough to learn but so hostile as to be almost
untrainable.

###### Encounter

A dense thicket of tall shrubs encircles a watering hole around 70’ in diameter. The watering hole
is the hunting ground of **three crab spiders** who feed on any creatures that stop to drink. The
crab spiders hide camouflaged in the shrubs, so characters encountering them suffer a -2 penalty to
surprise rolls.

**Giant crab spiders (3):** Spd 120’, AC 2, HD 2\*\*, hp 12, 8, 6, #AT 1 (bite 9+), Dmg 1d8
+poison, Save F1, ML -1, AL N, XP 38; Special: poison bite (save v. Poison at +2 or die in 1d4
turns)

Among the remains of the spiders’ prey can be salvaged 14 antlers (10gp, 1 st each).
