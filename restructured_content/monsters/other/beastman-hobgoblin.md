### Beastman, Hobgoblin

Hobgoblins were cross-bred from goblins and men by the ancient Zaharans as elite shock troops
during the Empyrean War. Standing well over 6’ tall and weighing around 215 lbs, they are much
larger, stronger, and smarter than their diminutive cousins. Hobgoblins have dark orange or
red-orange skin, with hair ranging from dark reddish-brown to dark gray. Hobgoblins’ eyes are
yellowish or dark brown, while their teeth are yellow. Their garments tend to be brightly colored,
often blood red with black-dyed leather.

###### Combat

Hobgoblins are **formidable warriors** and receive a +1 damage bonus. They always keep their arms
and armor in good repair and close at hand and are capable of fighting in well-ordered close
formations such as maniples and phalanxes.

Unless special troops are present (p. XX), 50% of gangs or warbands encountered will be archers
(round up), 50% will be warriors (round down). Hobgoblin warriors are equipped with leather armor,
spear, sword, and shield. Some hobgoblin tribes field warriors equipped with scale armor and pole
arm. Hobgoblin archers are equipped with scale armor, composite bow, 20 arrows, and sword.

###### Ecology

Each hobgoblin gang will be led by a champion with 5 AC, 2 HD, 9 hp, and a +1 damage bonus. Each
hobgoblin warband will be led by a sub-chieftain with 6 AC, 3 HD, 13 hp, and a +2 damage bonus. A
hobgoblin lair or village will be led by a chieftain with 7 AC, 5 HD, 21 hp, and a +3 damage bonus.
As long as the chieftain is alive, the hobgoblins will gain a +2 bonus to morale rolls.

Hobgoblin lairs and villages will have drudges and whelps equal to 100% and 200% of the number of
warriors, respectively. Hobgoblin drudges fight as goblins. Hobgoblin whelps have Spd 60’, AC 0, 1
hp, ML -4, and do not fight.

When hobgoblins are encountered in a village, certain additional creatures may be present. There is
a 60% chance a hobgoblin village will be guarded by 2d6 trained cave gorillas. There is a 50% chance
for 1d10 enslaved captives per warband. In addition, a hobgoblin village has a 90% chance to have a
shaman present and a 75% chance of a witch doctor. A shaman is equivalent to a sub-chieftain
statistically, but has Shaman abilities at level 1d8. A witch doctor is equivalent to a champion
statistically, but has Mage abilities at level 1d6.
