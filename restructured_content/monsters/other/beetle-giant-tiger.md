### Beetle, Giant Tiger

These carnivorous monstrosities can measure up to 5' long and can weigh as much as 600 lbs. Their
black carapaces are decorated with yellow stripes, the pattern somewhat resembling the hide of a
tiger. Though they typically prey on other giant insects, giant tiger beetles can and do hunt and
devour large mammals, including humanoids.

###### Combat

Giant tiger beetles have **terrestrial mechanoreception** enabling them to sense vibration in the
ground over long distances equivalent to line of sight in full daylight. Spells or effects that
would ordinarily cause blindness do not affect the beetle when its using terrestrial
mechanoreception. However, creatures that are flying, levitating, or otherwise not touching the
ground are invisible to the sense. Terrestrial mechanoreception can penetrate structures and terrain
features.

Giant tiger beetles are immensely strong even for beetles. In combat, they attack using their
razor-sharp mandibles for deadly effect.

###### Ecology

When a nest of giant tiger beetles is encountered, there is a 7% chance per beetle that it will be
incubating a clutch of 2d6 eggs. The eggs have 1 hp and weigh 2/6 st. Beetle larvae are rarely found
in nests, because the larvae immediately disperse into the wild after they emerge from their eggs.

###### Spoils

A slain giant tiger beetle can be harvested with Animal Husbandry 2 for the following component:

* chitinous spurs (1 stone, 65gp, armor +2, weapon +1)

A giant tiger beetle's two largest mandibles fetch 6sp each. Its armored hide fetches 25gp and
weighs 1 4/6 st.

###### Encounter

A large mound of earth ahead is pocketed with six tunnel mouths, each 2’-5’ in diameter. The
tunnels look to have been burrowed by a pony-sized animal, perhaps a giant weasel. The tunnels are
each 10-30’ long, all terminating in a central 30’ square room occupied by **four giant tiger
beetles**. These carnivorous insects devoured the prior denizens, and now nest within.

**Giant tiger beetles (4):** Spd 150’, AC 6, HD 3+1, hp 21, 20, 19, 15, #AT 1 (bite 7+), Dmg 2d6
{P}, Save F1, ML +1, AL N, XP 65

The interior of the tunnels is littered with the remains of prey. All of the remains are just
bones, except for the gruesomely masticated cadaver of an explorer. The explorer’s backpack holds
two bundles of weasel fur pelts (15gp, 3 st each). The explorer’s hand is missing; wrapped around
the wrist of the stump are six scrimshaw bracelets (20gp each).
