### Beetle, Giant Bombardier

The giant bombardier beetle is a gargantuan version of the ordinary bombardier beetle found
throughout Aurëpos. These subterranean nocturnal insects are about 3’ long, with immense horn-like
mandibles and a bulky 130 lbs build.

###### Combat

Giant bombardier beetles have **terrestrial mechanoreception** enabling them to sense vibration in
the ground over long distances equivalent to line of sight in full daylight. Spells or effects that
would ordinarily cause blindness do not affect the beetle when its using terrestrial
mechanoreception. However, creatures that are flying, levitating, or otherwise not touching the
ground are invisible to the sense. Terrestrial mechanoreception can penetrate structures and terrain
features.

The bite of a bombardier beetles is not as strong as those of other giant beetles, though it can
still grievously wound or kill an ordinary man.

However, in lieu of attacking withs bite, a bombardier beetle can spray toxic fluid at an opponent
within 5'. If the toxic fluid hits, the opponent becomes **queasy** until the fluid is washed off or
a *cure injury* spell ends the condition. Washing off the fluid requires one turn and consumes a
waterskin of water.

###### Ecology

When a nest of bombardier beetles is encountered, there is a 7% chance per beetle that it will be
incubating a clutch of 2d6 eggs. The eggs have 1 hp and weight 1/20 st. Beetle larvae are rarely
found in nests, because the larvae immediately disperse into the wild after they emerge from their
eggs.

###### Spoils

A slain bombardier beetle can be harvested with Animal Husbandry 2 for the following component:

* toxin vestibule (2/6 st, 20gp, *rain of vitriol, vitriolic infusion*)

###### Encounter

Erupting from the ground here is a giant anthill, 45’ in diameter and 30’ tall. The side of the
anthill has been burned open, as if by acid. The 7’ wide gash gives access to a twisting warren of
passages each 2-8’ in diameter, occasionally (20%) punctuated by 5-20’ square rooms. The giant ants
that built the hill have since migrated elsewhere, and the anthill is now the nest of **seven giant
bombardier beetles**.

**Giant bombardier beetles (7):** Spd 120’, AC 5, HD 2, hp 13, 13, 12, 10, 10, 9, 7, #AT 1 (bite or
spray 9+), Dmg 1d6 {P} or toxic spray, Save F1, ML 0, AL N, XP 20; Special: toxic spray

Buried inside the anthill is a small wrought gold ring (200gp) that the ants had carried into the
lair before their migration.
