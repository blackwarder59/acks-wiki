### Haunt

Haunts are incorporeal undead condemned to linger at the place of their death. Sometimes haunts
arise when sapient creatures are violently slain in sinkholes of evil, which can trap souls and
prevent their transmigration to other spheres. Other times haunts are created by greater undead such
as wights or specters, whose enervating touch can leave a soul too weak to pass on to the afterlife.

However it is made, a haunt looks much as it did just before its death, though it is weightless and
slightly transparent. It can be easily recognized by those who knew the haunt in life, or have seen
its face in paintings or statues. Whatever wounds claimed its life will always be visible on its
ghostly body.

Haunts remember their prior lives dimly, as if it were a dream. Though sapient, they do not form
lasting memories based on their undead existence, living in an ephemeral eternal now.

###### Combat

Every haunt is condemned to remain within 300’ of the place where it died until it is destroyed.
For instance, a specter might enervate all of the residents of a hamlet, and its victims would
thereafter linger as haunts in and around their hamlet.

Left undisturbed, haunts tend to re-play moments from their mortal lives, often the moment of their
death. If disturbed, they will attack with their **haunting embrace**. Any creature embraced by the
haunt must make a Paralysis saving throw. If the save succeeds, the creature suffers 1 {N!}damage.
If the save fails the creature suffers 1 {N!} damage and is **faltering** until the end of its next
initiative. However:

* If already faltering, the creature suffers 1d3 {N!} damage and is **frightened** until the end of
its next initiative.
* If already frightened, the creature suffers 1d6 {N!} damage.

Haunts are **immune** to enchantment effects, necrotic damage, poisonous damage, and all mundane
damage. As **incorporeal** beings, natural and non-magical weapons always deal mundane damage
against them, even if the creature would otherwise deal extraordinary damage. However, silver
weapons deal extraordinary damage against them.

Haunts created by violent death in a sinkhole of evil are automatically destroyed if their remains
are found and cremated outside the sinkhole. Haunts created by enervation are automatically
destroyed if their remains are found and cremated and the undead which created them is destroyed.

They are inherently evil for purposes of *discern evil*and *holy circle*spells and are rebuked as
zombies. Rebuked haunts instantly vanish, returning only when the duration expires.

###### Ecology

Haunts can be encountered any place the chill of undeath has touched. It is not uncommon to find
them haunting lonely mansions, remote lighthouses, and other places where isolated men and women
might fall victim to undeath.
