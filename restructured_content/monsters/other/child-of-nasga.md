### Child of Nasga

Beautiful yet alien, sensuous and wicked, the Children of Nasga are 20’ long snakes with silken
black scales and androgynous human-like faces. They possess a cunning intellect and can speak both
Ancient Zaharan and Ancient Thrassian. Devoted to Nasga, the Serpent, they are known to have served
the most powerful cultists of that chthonic faith in ages past, or in some cases to have led Nasgan
cults of their own.

###### Combat

The Children of Nasga have **bewitching beauty.** Each creature that is beholding the Child at the
start of its initiative must make a Spells saving throw. If the save fails, the creature is
**bewitched** for 1 turn. If the save succeeds, the creature is not betwitched and cannot be
effected again by any Child’s bewitching beauty for 1 turn.

The Children of Nasga have **venomous bites** that deal 1d4 {P!}damage. Any creature damaged by a
Child’s bite must make a Death saving throw. If the save fails, the creature dies of poison 1d4+2
turns later. In addition, when a Child successfully bites a creature, it also constricts the
creature for 2d8 {B!}damage and **restrains** it. If the Child misses its bite, it can separately
attack by constriction. Once it has restrained a creature, the Child can automatically deal 2d8 [B!]
damage on its initiative each round to the restrained creature without having to make an attack
throw. Doing so counts as the Child’s constriction attack.

As a full-round action, a Child of Nasga can perform a sinuous and seductive **hypnotic dance.**
Once begun, the dance continues until the start of the Child’s next initiative or until it is
slain.Each creature that beholds the dance must make a Spells saving throw at the start of its
initiative. Creatures bewitched by the Child save at a -4 penalty. If the save fails, the creature
becomes **mesmerized** for 2d6 rounds. If the save succeeds, there is no effect. The Child cannot
perform a hypnotic dance while restraining a creature.

Like other Chaotic incarnations, Children of Nasga can be detected with *discern evil*, held at bay
by *holy circle,* destroyed with *dispel evil*,and rebuked as infernals.

###### Ecology

With the fall of the Zaharan Empire, most of the Children of Nasga were bound into great etched
copper bowls sealed with magical runes and wax, there to await in slumber until the Awakening, when
the Chthonic gods will call them forth to fulfill their dark purposes again. As such, they are only
rarely encountered outside ancient temples and tombs.
