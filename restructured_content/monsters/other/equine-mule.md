### Equine, Mule

Mules are a hybrid of a donkey and a medium horse. Mules are primarily used for draft, but can be
used for riding or war. Mules are never found in the wild and never have young. Because of their
**sure-footedness**, mules can be taken into the depths of a dungeon to aid in transporting
equipment or treasure and their movement multiplier in mountain hexes is x2/3 instead of x1/2.

###### Combat

Mules are notoriously ornery, and may attack if particularly provoked. Like horses, mules can
benefit from **training for war**. War-trained mules gain +2 to morale but does not gain an extra
hoof attack. The rider of a war-trained mule can attack with a charge, dealing double damage with a
lance, and a war-trained mule can attack with its hoof during the charge as well.

###### Ecology

When a mule herd is encountered, there is a 10% chance it will be accompanied by 1 medium horse, 1
donkey, 1d4 juvenile mules and 1d2 baby mules. Juveniles have AC 0, Spd 120’, HD 1, and attack with
1 hoof (1d2 {B}). Babies have AC -1, Spd 120’, HD ½, and attack with 1 hoof (1 {B}).

Mules are bred for strength, speed, and stamina, and finely-bred mules often have exceptional
attributes (see “Attributes for Monsters,” on p. XXX). Mules with DEX 13+ have their encounter speed
adjusted by 12.5’ x DEX bonus. Their combat speed is adjusted by one-third the encounter speed
adjustment. Their ability to travel long distances quickly is limited by their stamina as well as
speed, so mules have their expeditions peed adjusted by the lower of DEX or CON bonus x 2.5 miles.
Mules with STR 13+ have their maximum load adjusted by their STR bonus x 2.5 st.

###### Spoils

A slain mule with exceptional attributes can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery)
or Trapping for the following component:

* hooves (2/6 st., 20gp, *safe travels, vigor*)

###### Lore

*From the bearded donkey and the highland pony, the dwarves produce strong and sure-footed mules
with the best traits of both parents. These hardy mules are the preferred driving, pack, and riding
animal among the dwarves.*

* Sürcaneus of Cyfaraun, *Cyclopedia of Dwarven Civilization*
