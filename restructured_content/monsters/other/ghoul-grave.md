### Ghoul, Grave

Grave ghouls are cannibalistic undead creatures found throughout Aurëpos. Flesh-eating mockeries of
their former existence, they are driven by an insatiable hunger. If unable to feed, grave ghouls
begin to rot like the corpses they are.

###### Combat

Grave ghouls attack by clawing and biting their targets. Even the tiniest bite or scratch from a
grave ghoul is dangerous, for they carry a horrifically virulent form of **ghoul fever**. After a
ghoul completes its attack routine (including any cleaves), each humanoid it damaged that initiative
must make a Paralysis saving throw to see if it has become infected. If the save succeeds, the
creature is not infected. If the save fails, the creature begins to violently spasm at the end of
the grave ghoul’s initiative. While spasming, the creature is considered **paralyzed**.The paralysis
can be cured with *cure light injury* or *cure disease;* otherwise it subsides after 2d4 rounds. The
creature remains infected and doomed to become a ghoul if not cured (see below).

Even if it avoids becoming paralyzed by the ghoul, a humanoid creature that loses 50% or more of
its total hp fighting grave ghouls is automatically infected with ghoul fever.

A creature infected by a grave ghoul’s ghoul fever will become a grave ghoul in 2d6 days. This
transformation can be prevented with the divine spell *cure disease* if cast before the disease has
taken full hold.

As undead, grave ghouls are immune to enchantment effects, necrotic damage, and poisonous damage.
They are inherently evil for purposes of *discern evil*and *holy circle*spells. They are rebuked as
ghouls.

###### Ecology

Grave ghouls often haunt cemeteries, tombs, and other places of death.

###### Spoils

A destroyed grave ghoul can be harvested with Healing 2 for the following components useful in
magic research:

* claws (2/6 st., 19gp, *halt humanoid, halt monster*)
* liver (2/6 st., 19gp, *cause disease*)

###### Lore

*Ghouls feast on the flesh of living creatures, and in so doing, pass on the blessing of unlife.
Those who die from their sacred bite need not fear reincarnation, for their soul shall stay with
their body, to rise again, and pass onward the blessing.*

* Ishme-Dagan, *The Corporium,* Vol. 2, “On the Creation of Ghouls”
