### Morlock

Morlocks are cannibalistic humanoids that dwell in the underdark below Aurëpos. The Tower of
Knowledge had long claimed that morlocks were mythical boogeymen of dwarvish folklore, until in 241
I.Y. morlocks breached the salt mines of Alakyrum and slaughtered hundreds.

Based on interrogation of morlocks captured during the reclamation of the mines, sages came to
understand that the creatures were actually the descendants of human beings who fled underground to
hide from the destruction of the Day Without Night. In the thousands of years since that cataclysm,
they have degenerated into a race of twisted albinos with pale eyes that are nearly blind in bright
light, but see with perfect clarity in total darkness.

They rarely venture to the surface, and then only at night. They are most often encountered by
dwarves, gnomes, and neanderthals who dwell below ground. Morlocks seem to have a deep-seated hatred
for these races, seeing them as interlopers into an underdark that is rightfully theirs.

###### Combat

Morlocks have **lightless vision** to a 90’ range, but suffer from **light sensitivity**. If caught
in bright daylight or *perpetual illumination* they suffer an attack penalty of -2.

50% of morlock warrior will be equipped with spears and hide armor, while 50% will be equipped with
3 javelins, hand axes, and shields.

They are automatically Hostile to dwarves, gnomes, and neanderthals, and attack immediately.

###### Ecology

Each morlock gang will be led by a champion with 2 AC, 1+1 HD, and 8 hp. Each morlock warband will
be led by a sub-chieftain with 3 AC, 2 HD, 12 hp, and a +1 damage bonus. A morlock village will be
led by a chieftain with 4 AC, 3 HD, 15 hp, and a +2 damage bonus.

Morlock lairs and vaults will have drudges and whelps equal to 200% and 200% of the number of
warriors, respectively. Morlock drudges fight as kobolds. Morlock whelps have AC 0, Spd 90’, 1hp, ML
-4, and do not fight.

When morlocks are encountered in a vault, certain additional creatures will be present. There is a
50% chance for 1d10 enslaved captives per warband. There is a 75% chance a morlock vault will be
guarded by 3d6 cave gorillas.

###### Spoils
