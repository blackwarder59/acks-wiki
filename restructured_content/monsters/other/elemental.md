### Elemental

There are four Elemental Sphere in orbit around the Celestial Sphere: the Spheres of Air, Earth,
Fire, and Water. The elements on these spheres are alive, permeated with the divine spark of the
Cosmarch; but it is a collective, subsumed into the ubiquity of the element, all dwelling in union
with all. Conjuration and summoning spells, however, can tear a fragment of the living element away
from its collective, instantiating it as an individual creature, an **elemental**, on the Celestial
Sphere.

Whatever their element, all elementals are **immune** to enchantment effects, necrotic damage,
poisonous damage, and mundane bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. They all have **lightless
vision** (ranges varies by element), with other senses afforded by their element. If they possess
aerial or aquatic mechanoreception, it is effective to a range equal to their movement. As
incarnations, elementals can be held at bay by *holy circle* anddispelled with *counterspell* or
*dispel magic*.

Because they are instantiated by the spells that conjure them, elementals understand the languages
of their summoner.

###### Elemental Characteristics by Tier

Elementals come in four **tiers** of power: petty, minor, major, and supreme. Many of an
elemental’s characteristics depend primarily on its tier.

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Elemental Characteristics by Tier | | | | | | |
| Rank | Size | AC | HD | Damage | Save | XP |
| Petty | Large | 5 | 4\* | 1d4 | F4 | 135 |
| Minor | Huge | 7 | 8\* | 1d8 | F8 | 1,100 |
| Major | Gigantic | 9 | 12\* | 2d8 | F12 | 2,100 |
| Supreme | Colossal | 11 | 16\* | 3d8 | F16 | 3,300 |

###### Elemental Characteristics by Element

The other characteristics of an elemental are determined by its **element**. The Elemental
Characteristics by Element tables, on the adjoining page, detail these characteristics. Other notes
about the different elements are below.

**Air Elementals:** Air elementals appear as twirling masses of air crackling with lightning. For
every HD possessed by an air elemental, it has a diameter of 6” and a height of 2'. For instance, a
supreme air elemental with 16 HD would have a diameter of 8’ and a height of 32'.

Air elementals always deal {E!}damage. They inflict double damage dice when they hit targets flying
in the air. When an air elemental damages a creature smaller than itself, the creature must make a
size-adjusted Paralysis save. If the save fails, the creature is spun off in a random direction to a
distance equal to the height of the elemental, landing **prone**. The air elemental can cleave after
spinning off a creature.

###### Elemental Characteristics by Element

**Earth Elementals:** Earth elementals appear as giant humanoids made of earth. For every HD
possessed by an earth elemental, it will stand 1' tall and 6” wide. For instance, a major earth
elemental with 12 HD would be 12’ high and 6’ wide. Earth elementals are unable to move through
bodies of water that are wider than the elemental is tall. For example, a 12’ earth elemental can
cross a 9’ stream but not a 20’ river.

Earth elementals always deal {Se!} mic damage. They deal double damage dice when they hit targets
standing on the ground. When an earth elemental damages a creature smaller than itself, the creature
must make a Paralysis save with a -2 penalty per difference in size. If the save fails, the creature
is knocked **prone** and flung away from the elemental a distance 1’ per point of damage dealt. The
earth elemental can cleave after toppling and flinging a creature.

**Fire Elementals:** Fire elementals appear as giant pillars of flame. For every HD possessed by a
fire elemental, it will have a diameter of 1' and a height of 1'. For instance, a minor fire
elemental with 8 HD would be have a diameter of 8’ and height of 8’. Fire elementals are unable to
move through bodies of water that are wider than the elemental’s diameter.

Fire elementals always deal {F!} damage. They deal double damage dice when they hit targets that
are **burning** or are carrying candles, lanterns, torches, or other open flames. When a fire
elemental damages a creature, the creature must make a Blast saving throw. If the save fails, the
creature starts **burning**.Itsuffering 1d8 fire damage at the start of its next initiative. The
condition ends if the fire elemental is dispelled or destroyed, the burning creature dies, the
flames are extinguished by immersion in water, or after 2 rounds elapse.

**Water Elementals:** Water elementals appear as a large mass of watery waves. For every HD
possessed by a water elemental, it will have a diameter of 2' and a height of 6”. For instance, a
petty water elemental with 4 HD would be 2' high and have an 8' diameter. Water elementals can move
across land at their swimming speed but can never move further than 60' from a water source.

Water elementals always deal {C!} damage. They deal double damage dice when they hit opponents
standing or submerged in water. When a water elemental damages a creature smaller than itself, the
creature must make a Paralysis save with a -2 penalty per difference in size. If the save fails, the
creature begins drowning.

###### Elemental Components

A destroyed elemental can be harvested with Alchemy 2. The components that can be harvested depend
on the elemental’s element.

* Air - gaseous residue (*all air effects*)
* Earth - solid residue (*all earth effects*)
* Fire - burning residue (*all fire effects*)
* Water - wet residue (*all water effects*.

The value and weight of the components that can be harvested depend on the elemental’s tier:

* Petty – 135gp, 2 1/6 st.
* Minor – 1,100gp, 18 2/6 st.
* Major – 2,200gp, 36 4/6 st
* Supreme – 3,300gp, 55 st
