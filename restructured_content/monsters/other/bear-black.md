### Bear, Black

Black bears are omnivorous apex predators that live in many different climates throughout Cybele.
They average 6' tall and weigh about 550 lbs. They dine on a variety of fruits and other foliage
more frequently than meat. Black bears do not usually engage in combat unless they are forced to do
so in defense of their cubs. However, black bears defending their cubs gain a +4 bonus to morale
rolls.

###### Combat

Black bears have **acute olfaction** and gain a +1 bonus to avoid surprise in their natural
habitat. They can track the scent of creatures for up to 6 miles with the equivalent of three ranks
of Tracking proficiency. They are **skilled climbers** (the best of any of the bears), able to
ascend sheer surfaces as if they were thieves (4+).

If a black bear successfully attacks the same target with both claws in the same attack routine, it
immediately **hugs** the target for an additional 2d8 {B} damage. If the hug kills the target, the
bear can cleave with its claw.

###### Ecology

When black bears are encountered in a wilderness den, there isa 66% chance the adults will be
rearing bear cubs. Roll 1d4 for their age and number: 1 it’s 1d2+1 babies, 2-4 it’s 1d3-1 juveniles.
Juvenile black bears have AC 1, Spd 90’, HD 2, and attack with two claws (1 {S}) and bite (1d2 {P}).
Baby black bears have AC 0, Spd 90’, HD 1+1, and attack with one nibble (1 {P}).

###### Spoils

A slain black bear with exceptional attributes can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor
(Butchery) or Trapping for the following components useful in magic research:

* claws (3/6 st, 30gp, *iron maiden, swift sword*)
* stomach (5/6 st, 50gp, *call of the wild bear, slumber*)

A black bears's pelt fetches 45gp and weighs 1 3/6 st.

While not domesticated, black bears can be trained and tamed relatively easily if captured while
young.

###### Encounter

From the rich soil here sprouts a centuries-old oak tree, its great trunk over 10’ in diameter. A
hollow has formed in the tree’s base, which serves as the den of a **mated pair of black bears** and
their **two cubs**. The black bears will not engage in combat unless they have to, but will give
their lives to defend their cubs.
