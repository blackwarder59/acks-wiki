### Bat, Common

Common bats are small nocturnal flying mammals with leathery wings. By day bats nestle in dark
forests, lightless caverns, and abandoned towers and attics. By night, they emerge from their roosts
in great swarms, patrolling the skies for prey using their echolocation.

###### Combat

Since eyesight is of little use in the dark, bats navigate and hunt with **echolocation** (360’
range). No spells or effects that would ordinarily blind a creature will affect a bat, but
*inaudible* creatures are hidden from them, and *noiselessness* blinds them.

Common bats are small insectivores who do not attack for significant damage individually. They are
**not disposed to fight**, and as such they must make a morale roll at the end of every round. (The
morale roll does not apply to bats that are under another’s control or are familiars.)

###### Ecology

Although individual bats can be encountered flapping around dungeons, normally they will be
encountered in such great number as to constitute a swarm. See the Swarm monster entry (p. XX) for
further information on bat swarms.

###### Spoils

A slain common bat cannot be harvested for special components.

###### Lore

*The bat is a creature upon which countless civilizations have projected their myths and legends.*

*In the Auran Empire, the bat is believed ill-omened, cursed by Ammonar to shun his glorious light
to dwell forever in the tenebrous night.*

*In dusky Kemesh, the bat is held sacred, especially by the priestesses of Nasga. Great swarms of
blood-drinking bats are said to be bred in the high lofts of the ziggurats and sent forth by night
to shed blood for their dark mistresses…*

*In truth, the bat deserves neither the condemnation nor the acclaim. It is merely an animal,
perhaps related to the fox or the rat, and certainly not an incarnation of chaos. Even its penchant
for drinking blood is much exaggerated; indeed, the bats I have come upon in the caves and forests
of Aurëpos have preferred to nibble on fruit.*

*That there exist dangerous species of bats cannot be denied; but that the common bat itself is a
harbinger of vampiric undeath must be dismissed as mere folklore.*

* Toraster the Elder, *Bestiary of Aurëpos*
