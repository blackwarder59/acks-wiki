### Baboon, Rock

These black-haired black-eyed baboons are found throughout Ulruk and as far north as the Dark Wall
in Southern Argollë. They stand 4’6” tall and weigh 230lbs, though the largest strongest males can
reach 6’ in height.

Rock baboons are highly intelligent animals capable of forming plans and using tools. While they do
not have a true language, rock baboons can plead, threaten, and warn other creatures with cries,
screams, and gestures. They are omnivores that often hunt for meat.

###### Combat

Unlike most apes, rock baboons are highly aggressive, and are easily stimulated to fight (-1
penalty to reaction rolls). In combat, they both bite and use sticks as clubs.

Baboons are very agile and strong, capable of easily scaling trees or rocks and leaping across
ledges or branches. They can climb as if they were 5th level thieves and jump as if they had 18 DEX.

###### Ecology

When rock baboons are encountered in their den, the adults will be raising 3d6-3 juvenile baboons
and 2d6-2 baby baboons. Juvenile rock baboons have Speed 90’, AC 1, 1 HD, and attack with a bite (1
piercing damage). Infant baboons have Spd 90’, AC 0, 1 hp, ML -4, and do not fight.

###### Spoils

A slain rock baboon with exceptional attributes can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor
(Butchery) or Trapping for the following components useful in magic research:

* skull (2/6 st, 20gp, *frighten beast, speak with beasts*)

A rock baboon's pelt fetches 25gp and weighs 4/6 st.

###### Encounter

High atop the trees of a rugged, broken landscape, **15 rock baboons** keep watch day and night for
any intruders to their den. They patrol between the treetops and the large cliffs, calling out to
one another with high-pitched howls and screeches. If anyone encroaches, the seven largest baboons
will attack, leaping down on them from the upper branches of the trees. The remaining baboons will
hang back to protect the young, consisting of **5 juveniles** and **7 babies**. The baboons have no
treasure, but tall, colorful spikes of finger-like flowers grow thickly along the rocky slopes where
they live. A Naturalism proficiency throw recognizes this as foxglove, a poisonous plant. There are
enough plants to extract six doses of toxin (see *ACKS*,p.250).
