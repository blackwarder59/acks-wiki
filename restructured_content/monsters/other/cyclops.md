### Cyclops

Cyclopes stand 20’ tall and weigh 5,800 lbs. Each bears just one large eye centered above its nose.
Close relatives to the true giants, their origins are unknown to even the wisest sages. According to
adventurers who have encountered them, cyclopes are somewhat childlike, having both the cruelty and
credulous of pubescent boys. They often keep flocks of sheep and sometimes cultivate grapes,
dwelling in nearby caves that overlook their flocks and vineyards.

Cyclops speak the bombastic, booming language of giants. They can also speak simple words and
phrases in Common.

###### Combat

In combat, cyclopes can smash with their fists or with weapons. When smashing with piercing or
slashing weapons, cyclopes deliver **vicious blows** that deal an additional 4 points per smash.
When smashing with bludgeoning weapons, cyclopes can **topple and fling** man-sized or smaller
creatures with every attack. A small or man-sized creature struck by a cyclops’s smash must make a
size-adjusted Paralysis saving throw or be knocked prone and forced back a number of feet equal to
the damage dealt. If this would push the creature into a wall or obstacle, the creature takes 1d6
points of damage per 10’ he has traveled. If the creature is pushed into another character or
monster, he is halted. If the character or monster he is pushed into is smaller, the
character/monster is instead knocked down, and the opponent continues to be forced back. A cyclops
can cleave after a successful smash that forces back its target.

Instead of smashing, cyclops can **hurl boulders** to a distance of 900’, dealing 3d6 bludgeoning
damage in a 5’ radius to the impact point. When hurling a boulder, a giant functions like a heavy
ballista using the rules for Missile Attacks with Artillery (***ACKS II RR****,* p. XX). However,
because they have reduced depth perception, they suffer a -2 penalty to the attack throw. The
cyclops has no minimum range and does not need to reload, so it can throw a boulder each round it
has sufficient ammunition.

A cyclops has a 10% chance to have the ability to *bestow curse* as a spell-like ability once per
week.

###### Ecology

Cyclops are loners, and live together in small numbers only on occasion. When 2 or more cyclops are
encountered in a lair, they have a 25% chance to be a family. (If not, they are just a bachelor
gang.) A cyclopes family consists of 2 adults and up to one juvenile and one baby cyclops. Juvenile
cyclops have AC 2, Spd 60’, HD 6+2, and attack with 1 smash (1d10 {B}). Baby cyclops have AC 1, Spd
60’, HD 4+1, and attack with 1 smash (1d4 {B}).

###### Spoils

A slain cyclops can be harvested with Healing for the following component:

* eye (23 2/6 st, 1,400gp, *bestow curse, clairvoyance, scry,* armor +1, weapon +3*)*

If a cyclops family is encountered, up to 50% of the value can be in livestock or wine. Bachelor
gangs have ordinary treasure.
