### Sea Serpent

Sages are divided as to whether sea serpents are the degenerate descendants of sea dragons or
prehistoric remnants of some ancient serpentine creature that has gone extinct on land. Sailors are
unanimous in believing that sea serpents are exceptionally dangerous predators with a propensity to
sink ships. The immense snake-like monsters measure 30' long and weigh around 6,500 lbs.

###### Combat

A sea serpent will be automatically Hostile to any vessel it encounters with a length of less than
30’. It might or might not be Hostile to larger vessels (make a reaction roll).

Sea serpents have on a lateral line system that affords them **aquatic mechanoreception**. They can
“see” in water up to 360’ by sensing changes in water current and water pressure. Spells or effects
that would ordinarily cause blindness do not affect the serpent while it is using aquatic
mechanoreception. However, creatures that are not in the water are invisible to them. Aquatic
mechanoreception does not penetrate structures or terrain features.

A sea serpent can bite creatures within 15’ of the water with its vicious fangs for 2d6 {P!}
damage. It can also constrict its serpentine coils around vessels or creatures of huge size or
larger in the water. A successful constriction deals 1d10 {B!} damage and, as a gigantic creature,
it deals full structural damage to vessels. It also **restrains** the creature or vessel in the
serpent’s coils (p. XX). Thereafter, while the creature or vessel remains restrained, the sea
serpent can automatically deal an additional 1d10 {B!} damage on its initiative each round to the
restrained creature or vessel without having to make an attack throw. Doing so counts as the
serpent’s constriction attack.

A sea serpent cannot bite vessels, nor can it constrict creatures of large size or less, or
creatures of any size in the air, on land or in vessels.

###### Ecology

Sea serpents do not establish nests or exhibit any parental care for their offspring. They rely on
pelagic spawning, in which the female releases her eggs into the water column and the male
externally fertilizes them. The eggs are buoyant and simply float until they hatch. Sea serpent eggs
have 1 hp and weigh 1 3/6 st.

###### Spoils

Although sea serpents have no lairs, their propensity for eating the cargo of sunken ships means
they may have treasure inside their bellies.

A slain sea serpent can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for
the following components useful in magic research:

* stomach (9 3/6 st, 570gp, *capsizing wave, choking grip, locate treasure, swimming,
waterbreathing*)
