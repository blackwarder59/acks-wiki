### Herd Animal Variant 1

### Herd Animal

Herd animals are grazing herbivores that roam the wilderness in herds or flocks. Region and climate
will determine which specific kind of grazing herd animal is encountered.

* Small herd animals include aoudads, chamois, domestic goats, domestic sheep, gazelles, ibexes,
mouflon, small deer and duikers, urials, and wild goats.
* Medium herd animals include addaxes, antelopes, argali, deer, duikers, impala, and reindeer.
* Large herd animals include bongos, domestic cattle, forest buffaloes, musk oxen, okapi, and
wildebeests.
* Very large herd animals include elands, elk, savanna buffalos, water buffalos, wisents, and yaks.
* Huge herd animals include gaur and giraffes.

###### Combat

Herd animals have **acute hearing** and gain a +1 bonus to surprise rolls in their natural habitat.

25% of herd animals will be full-grown adult male with antlers or horns. Males can make butt
attacks, which can deal double damage dice when used in a **charge**. Female herd animals generally
lack sizeable antlers or horns, and can only make kick attacks.

As a group, herd animals are **not disposed to fight**, and as such they must make a morale roll at
the end of every round.

Certain types of herd animals have additional abilities.

* **Elk/Reindeer:** These ungulates are **surefooted on snow** and retain their full speed in Snowy
conditions.
* **Chamois/Goat/Ibex:** These ungulates only have a speed of 50’ / 150’ instead of 80’ / 240’.
However, they can **climb** as 14th level thieves (2+). They often unintentionally mimic the sound
of human screams.
* **Water Buffalo**: These ungulates are strong **swimmers** (as the proficiency).

###### Ecology

When herd animals are encountered, they will be accompanied by 2d4 juvenile herd animals and 1d4
baby herd animals. Juvenile herd animals have ½ HD, 1 HD, 1+2 HD, 2 HD, and 2+2 HD, while baby herd
animals have 1 hp, 1/2 HD, 1 HD, 1+1 HD, and 1+3 HD.

###### Spoils

A slain herd animal with exceptional attributes can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor
(Butchery) or Trapping for the following component:

* genitals (1/6 to 3 2/6 st, 10 to 200gp, *sanctuary*)

If a small herd animal has antlers or horns, they fetch 1d10sp each. Medium antlers/horns fetch
2d6sp each. Large antlers/horns fetch 1d4gp each. Very large and huge antlers/horns fetch 1d10gp
each. All antlers/horns weigh 1 st per 10gp value.

A few herd animals can be valuable as workbeasts or even mounts, but most are simply used as
livestock or butchered for their meat.
