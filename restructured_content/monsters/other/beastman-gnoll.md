### Beastman, Gnoll

Gnolls are chaotic beastmen allegedly bred by the ancient Zaharans during the Empyrean War to
battle elven forces. Some sages believe gnolls descend from hybrids of men and hyenas, while others
insist they were bred from gnomes and trolls. Whatever the case, an adult gnoll is a fearsome
creature standing about 7’6” tall and 300 lbs with dirty yellow or reddish-brown fur. Gnolls prefer
to be carnivorous, favoring intelligent creatures for food because they scream more, though gnolls
themselves are not particularly intelligent.

###### Combat

Gnolls are **formidable warriors** and receive a +1 damage bonus. They benefit from **shaggy
hides** which, though not as thick as bugbear hides, still grant a +1 bonus to armor class.

Unless special troops are present (p. XX), 50% of gangs or warbands encountered will be archers
(round up), 50% will be warriors (round down). Most gnoll warriors are equipped with leather armor,
spear, battle axe, and shield. Some gnoll tribes field warriors equipped with scale armor and
morning star, pole arm, or two-handed sword. All gnoll archers are equipped with scale, long bow, 20
arrows, and battle axe.

###### Ecology

Each gnoll gang will be led by a champion with 5 AC, 3 HD, 16 hp, and a +2 damage bonus. Each gnoll
warband will be led by a sub-chieftain with 6 AC, 4 HD, 20 hp, and a +2 damage bonus. A gnoll lair
or village will be led by a chieftain with 7 AC, 6 HD, 28 hp, and a +3 damage bonus. As long as the
chieftain is alive, the gnolls will gain a +2 bonus to morale rolls.

Gnoll lairs and villages will have drudges and whelps equal to 100% and 200% of the number of
warriors, respectively. Gnoll drudges fight as orcs. Gnoll whelps have Spd 60’, AC 0, 1 hp, ML -4,
and do not fight.

When gnolls are encountered in a village, certain additional creatures will be present. There is a
33% chance a gnoll village will be guarded by 1d3 trolls and another 66% chance for 4d4 trained
hyenas. There is a 50% chance for 1d10 enslaved captives per warband. In addition, a village has a
60% chance of a shaman being present, and a 50% chance of a witch doctor. A shaman is equivalent to
sub-chieftain statistically, but has Shaman abilities at level 1d4+1. A witch doctor is equivalent
to a champion statistically, but has Mage abilities at level 1d4.

###### Spoils
