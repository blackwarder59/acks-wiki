### Hyena, Common

Hyenas are pack hunters that rove the warm shrublands of Opelenea, Kemesh, Somirea, Shebatea, and
Ulruk. They typically measure 4’ – 5.5’ in length and weigh 90 to 150lbs. They have huge skulls with
powerfully-built jaws set on squat, bear-like bodies with short hind legs. Their fur is typically
greyish-brown or yellowish-grey with irregular spots.

Wrongly despised as cowardly scavengers, hyenas are actually cunning predators capable of taking
down wildebeests.

###### Combat

Hyenas prefer to attack in packs and are more confident when their numbers are greater. If they do
not outnumber their prey by at least 3:1, or if 50% of their number has been lost, their morale
drops to -2.

Hyenas have incredibly powerful jaws that deliver **bone-breaking bites**. On an attack throw of an
unmodified 20 , the creature bitten must make a Death saving throw. If the save succeeds, the
creature suffers double the ordinary damage dice (2d8 {P}). If the save fails, the creature suffers
triple the ordinary damage (3d8 {P}) and has a limb broken. Roll 1d6 to determine which limb is
broken: 1-2 weapon hand, 3 weapon arm, 4-5 near leg, 6 far leg.

A broken limb has the same game effect as a missing limb (***ACKS II RR***Permanent Wounds tables,
p. XX – XX) until it heals. A broken limb heals after 180 days, or 90 days under treatment of a
healer.

###### Ecology

Hyenas organize themselves in large clans that can number as many as 90 animals. No more than 15-25
are typically encountered at once, however, as the hyenas are dispersed across a wide hunting range.
When hyenas are encountered in their den, the adults will be rearing 1d3 juvenile hyenas and 1d2
baby hyenas. Juvenile hyenas have AC 1, Spd 120’, HD 1, and attack with 1 bite (1d3 {P}). Baby
hyenas have AC 0, Spd 120’, HD 1-1, and attack with 1 bite (1 {P!}).

###### Spoils

Hyenas mark their territory with a white, gooey cream known as hyena butter that they secrete from
their rectum. The foul-smelling substance is sometimes collected by alchemist and shamans, as it can
be used as a miscellaneous special component for magic research. There will be 1d4gp worth of hyena
butter per hyena encountered.

A slain hyena with exceptional attributes can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery)
or Trapping for the following component:

* jawbone (3/6 st, 35gp, *dismember,* weapon +1)

A hyena's hide fetches 12gp and weighs 2/6 st. A hyena’s fangs fetch 8gp and weigh 1/6 st.

Hyena are smart enough to be trained, but their foul temper makes it unpleasant to do so. Most
trainers prefer to focus on more manageable beasts, such as war dogs.
