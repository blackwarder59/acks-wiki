### Basilisk, Noxious

The noxious basilisk, sometimes called the primordial basilisk, was created from spite and venom by
Iskara, Mother of Monsters, during her terrible war with the gods. It resembles a reptilian monster
with a dun-colored body and mustard-hued underbelly and a short, curved horn atop the nose. An adult
basilisk’s body grows to about 10’ long and weighs 300 lbs.

###### Combat

Noxious basilisks have tough hides that are **resistant** to mundane bludgeoning, piercing, and
slashing damage.

The bite of a noxious basilisk carries a **paralytic venom**. Any creature damaged by a primordial
basilisk’s bite must make a Death saving throw. If the save succeeds, the creature is not affected
by the venom. If the save fails, then creature suffers 6d6 {Po!} damage and becomes **paralyzed**
for 2d4 turns at the end of the basilisk’s initiative. The paralysis can be cured by *neutralize
poison* but not *cure light injury.* When the paralysis wears off, the poisoned creature is
**fatigued**. The fatigue ends if the poison is neutralized or after the creature enjoys 8 hours of
restful sleep.

In lieu of biting, a noxious basilisk can breathe a noxious cloud 20’ in diameter. Any creature
within the cloud’s area of effect must make a Death saving throw. The effects of the noxious cloud
are identical to the paralytic bite. A noxious basilisk’s breath weapon can be used once every 1d3
rounds.

###### Ecology

Noxious basilisks often live in dense woods or dungeons. When noxious basilisks are encountered in
a wilderness nest, there is a 10% chance per basilisk that it will be incubating 1d3 eggs. Basilisk
eggs have 1 hp and weigh 2/6 st. Basilisk hatchlings are rarely found in nests, because the
hatchlings immediately disperse into the wild after they emerge from their eggs.

###### Spoils

A slain noxious basilisk can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks)
for the following components useful in magic research:

* eyes (8 2/6 st., 500gp, *cloud of poison, cone of paralysis, halt monster, hypnotic sigil*)
* gizzard (8 2/6 st., 500gp, *cure injury, neutralize poison*)

A noxious basilisk’s horn fetches 2d10gp and weighs 1 stone for every 80gp.

Basilisks are difficult to train, but their powerful abilities allow them to command a premium.

###### Lore

*Horned basilisks appear as antagonists to the gods and heroes in the earliest recorded myths of
the Argollëans, dating back to 3,500 BE. Smoothskull basilisks, however, are not attested in
mythology until 2000 BE. From this, the sages of the Tower of Knowledge have surmised that the
horned basilisk is the older of the two species, and probably was created before the Day Without
Night.*
