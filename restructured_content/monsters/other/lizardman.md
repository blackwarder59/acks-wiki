### Lizardman

These scaly beastmen were magically crossbred from men and giant lizards sometime after the Day
Without Night. The dwarves claim that the elves of southern Argollë bred them, but the elves hotly
dispute this. All agree that lizardmen once had a powerful empire centered on the city of Thrassia,
from which they which dominated southern Aurëpos and eastern Ulruk. In the centuries since they have
degenerated to a state of primitive savagery.

Adult lizardmen stand 6' to 7' tall, resembling humans with the heads, claws, scales, and tails of
lizards. They are sometimes found in dungeons, especially if there is an aquatic entrance. They
otherwise dwell in lagoons, marshes, swamps and similar wetlands.

Lizardmen speak their own language, a degenerate form of Ancient Thrassian. A lizardman warrior has
a 10% chance of speaking Common, while a leader has a 10% chance per HD.

###### Combat

Lizardmen rely on their **scaly hides** for armor, which grant a +3 AC bonus. They are **formidable
warriors** and receive a +1 damage bonus with weapons. While not truly amphibious, they can **hold
their breaths** for up to 1 turn.

Lizardmen warriors are usually equipped with shields, stone hand axes, and 5 barbed darts or 3
javelins. 10% of warbands retain the sophistication to make and maintain leather armor (+2 AC).
Lizardmen primarily use weapons at range. Once they enter melee, they drop their shields to fight
with their claws and bite (suffering a -1 penalty to AC to do so).

###### Ecology

Each lizardman gang will be led by a champion with 5 AC, 3+1 HD, 17 hp, and a +2 damage bonus (+1
with its natural attacks). Each lizardman warband will be led by a sub-chieftain with 6 AC, 4+1 HD,
21 hp, and a +3 damage bonus (+2 with its natural attacks). A lizardman lair will be led by a
chieftain with 7 AC, 6+2 HD, 30 hp, and a +3 damage bonus (+2 with its natural attacks). As long as
the chieftain is alive, the lizardmen will gain a +2 bonus to morale rolls. Lizardmen lairs will
have drudges and eggs equal to 100% and 100% of the number of warriors. Lizardmen drudges have Spd
90’, AC 3, HD 2, and attack with 1 bite (1d6 {P}) or weapon.

When lizardmen are encountered in a village, certain additional creatures may be present. There is
a 60% chance a lizardman village will be guarded by 1d6 lounges of giant lizards. There is a 50%
chance for 1d10 enslaved captives per warband. A lizardman village has a 75% chance of a shaman
being present, and a 50% chance of a witch doctor. A shaman is equivalent to a sub-chieftain
statistically, but has Shaman abilities at level 1d6. A witch doctor is equivalent to a champion
statistically, but has Mage abilities of level 1d4.

###### Lore

*Researchers began with a stock of male human captives. They then introduced a stock of giant
lizards into the program. The resultant admixture possessed substantial strength and endurance and
was able to endure sun and water in equal measure. The adjoining illustration is of one such
“lizardman”, though the reader no doubt has seen these magnificent, loyal specimens at work in our
cities and villas.*
