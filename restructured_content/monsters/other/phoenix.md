### Phoenix

Phoenixes are divine birds who serve as heralds and messengers of Ammonar, lord of law and light.
They resemble majestic eagles, but weigh about 200 lbs and measure around 12’ in length with 30’
wingspans. Phoenixes have red and gold plumage characterized by a crest of seven gold feathers that
radiate from their heads like sunrays, with eyes of sapphire blue and legs covered in yellow-gold
scales with wine-colored talons.

As heralds of the gods, phoenixes speak Common, Classical Auran, and 1d6 other tongues, often
ancient or dead languages, along with the screeching tongue of rocs.

###### Combat

Phoenixes have **acute vision** and **alertness**, granting them a +2 bonus to avoid surprise in
their natural habitat.

The very sight of a phoenix is a **good omen**. Any Lawful character that beholds a phoenix is
protected by a *holy blessing* spell until the phoenix goes out of sight.

The tears of a phoenix have **curative properties**. Once per day, a phoenix can shed a teardrop
that can *cure critical wounds, cure disease, neutralize poison,* or *repair disability and
disfigurement.* The phoenix will only shed a tear forLawful characters in grave need who achieve
Friendly reactions. A phoenix’s teardrop can be stored temporarily if mixed with holy water, but its
efficacy fades at sunset.

Phoenixes are peaceful and will only fight to protect Lawful creatures or drive off Chaotic ones.
They attack from the air, making a **dive attack** with their talons. A dive attack inflicts double
the normal damage (2d6 {S!} /2d6 {S!}). If the phoenix hits a creature smaller than itself with both
its talons while making a dive attack, the creature must make a size-adjusted Paralysis saving
throw. If the save fails, the creature is **grabbed**.

If a phoenix is reduced to 0 hp, it combusts in a **fiery explosion** that reduces it to ash. Each
creature within 30’ of the phoenix’s torso (e.g. within its wingspan) when it explodes must make a
Blast saving throw. If the save fails, the creature suffers 4d6 {L!} {F!} damage. If the save
succeeds, the creature suffers half that damage.

At the end of the round following the round in which the phoenix explodes, a new phoenix is born
from its ashes with full HD and hp. However, if the ashes are collected and placed into a metamphora
before the phoenix is reborn, a new phoenix does not spawn and the ash can be used as a special
component.

###### Ecology

As incarnations, phoenixes do not age, eat, or reproduce. Most phoenixes soar the heavens,
descending from time to time to deliver messages or offer aid to the worthy. Occasionally, however,
a phoenix might make a lair, either to create or protect a pinnacle of good or to stand sentry over
a sinkhole of evil.
