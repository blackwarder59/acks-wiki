### Dakhanavar, Greater

Dakhanavars are often confused with vampires, but the creatures are distinct. The mother of
monsters, Iskara, bred the dakhanavar by infusing cacodemon ichor into the bodies of giant
blood-drinking bats. Greater dakhanavars were formed with the ichor of more powerful cacodemons.
They resemble bats of extraordinary size with wingspans of 50’ and weights of 500 lbs. They have
huge fanged mouths and great fingered wings barbed at each joint’s end with iron claws.

Dakhanavars are as intelligent as mortal men. They can speak Ancient Zaharan, Classical Auran,
Common, Elvish, and the dialect of any local beastmen. They dwell in forbidding ruins, dark forests,
and bleak cliffs.

###### Combat

A greater dakhanavar **is dreadful** to confront.A creature which starts its initiative, or moves
within, 60’ of a greater dakhanavar must make a Paralysis saving throw. If the save succeeds, the
creature gains immunity to the effects of every dakhanavar’s dreadfulness for 1 turn. If the save
fails, the creature starts **faltering.** If the creature was already faltering, it becomes
**frightened** instead. The faltering or frightened condition ends if removed magically or if the
greater dakhanavar is destroyed or no longer within 60’.

A greater dakhanavar can **shapechange** as a movement action into or from the form of a beautiful
elf. In elf form it can fight with weapons, making one attack per round and dealing double the
ordinary damage dice with each blow due to its preternatural strength. It retains its spellcasting
abilities and immunities, but is not dreadful to confront unless it wishes it.

If a greater dakhanavar damages a target with its bite, the dakhanavar latches onto it and begins
**draining blood**.Once latched on, the dakhanavar can use its combat action to automatically deal
2d6 {N!} damage to the creature each round. Creatures that are having their blood drained by a
dakhanavar can still move, but count as carrying extra encumbrance equal to its weight. The
dakhanavar moves with the creature from which it is drinking blood. However, if the creature is
light enough, the dakhanavar can fly off with it on its movement action.

Due to their spiritual nature, greater dakhanavars also possess the **spellcasting abilities** of
6th level mages. They are **immune** to mundane bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.

###### Ecology

When a greater dakhanavar is encountered in its roost, it has a 35% chance of ruling over a nest of
lesser dakhanavar and their accompanying bats and bat swarms. See the entry for lesser dakhanavar
for more information on their habitat, including breeding habits.
