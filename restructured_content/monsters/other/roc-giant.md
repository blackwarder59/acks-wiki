### Roc, Giant

Rocs are living symbols of the power and majesty of Ammonar, the Winged Sun, Empyrean god of light
and law. Giant rocs resemble colossal gold eagles, with golden-brown feathers with a metallic sheen.
These awe-inspiring birds are among the largest creatures in the world. Their wings span a titanic
240’ while their enormous bodies weigh around 15,000 lbs.

With lifespans even longer than the elves, gigantic rocs always speak Common, Classical Auran, and
1d6 other tongues, often ancient or dead languages, along with the screeching tongue of their kind.

###### Combat

Rocs have **acute vision** and **alertness**, granting them a +2 bonus to avoid surprise in their
natural habitat.

Rocs are inherently lawful creatures. Chaotic characters encountering rocs suffer -2 penalty to
reaction rolls, while neutral characters suffer a -1 penalty.

A flying roc can make a **dive attack** with their talons. A dive attack inflicts double the normal
damage dice (6d6 {S} / 6d6 {S}). If the roc hits a creature smaller than itself with both its talons
while making a dive attack, the creature must make a size-adjusted Paralysis saving throw. If the
save fails, the creature is **grabbed**.

###### Ecology

When giant rocs are encountered in their aerie, there is a 15% chance each roc is guarding eggs or
juveniles. Roll 1d4 for their number and age: 1-2, it’s 1d3 eggs, 3-4, it’s 1d3-1 juveniles.
Juvenile giant rocs have the characteristics of large rocs. Giant roc eggs have 3 hp and weigh 12
st.

Rocs defending their young do not have to make morale rolls; they always fight to the death.

###### Spoils

A giant roc corpse can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the
following components useful in magic research:

* beak (75 st, 4500gp, *cataclysm, force of impetus, sharpness, striking*, weapon +2)
* eyes (65 st, 3900gp, *lay of the land, locate distant object, locate place of power, scry*)
* tail feathers (70 st, 4200gp, any air elemental effects, armor +3)

A giant roc’s 6d10 flight feathers each fetch 6d20gp and weigh 1 st. Its two talons each fetch 18gp
and weigh 2/6 st.

Although sapient, rocs are difficult to train because of their sheer size, power, and speed. One
mistake can cause the would-be roc rider to die.
