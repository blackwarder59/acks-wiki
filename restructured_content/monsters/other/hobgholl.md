### Hobgholl

A hobgholl might appear to be a hobgoblin at first glance, but these monsters are a actually a
wicked, unholy magical hybrid of hobgoblin, ghoul, and troll.

Hobgholls have an affinity for the company of hobgoblins and trolls, and are occasionally employed
as bodyguards to chiefs of those races. Despite their ghoulish bloodline, hobgholls are not undead.

###### Combat

Hobgholls have the same paralyzing touch as a ghoul, and can regenerate as a troll for 1 hp per
round. Hit points are gained at the start of each combat round.

Hobgholls can attack with two vicious claws or with a weapon. After a hobgholl completes a claw
attack routine (including any cleaves), each humanoid it successfully struck that initiative must
make a Paralysis saving throw. If the save fails, the creature struck becomes **paralyzed** at the
end of the hobgholl’s initiative. If the save succeeds, the creature is not affected. The paralysis
can be cured with *cure light injury*. Elves, and those with an elven bloodline, are immune to the
paralysis of hobgholls.

###### Ecology

Hobgholls are exclusively male. They can reproduce by copulating with either hobgoblin or troll
breeders. However, the tainted bloodline of the hobgholl causes many of these unions to fail. Roll
1d6 upon childbirth: 1-2, the whelp is shriveled, ghoulish, and stillborn; 3-4, the whelp is an
ordinary specimen of its mother’s race; 5-6, the whelp is a baby hobgholl.

###### Spoils

A slain hobgholl can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 2 for the following
components useful in magic research:

* blood (2/6 st, 20gp, *trollblood*)
* claws (1 stone, 60gp, *halt humanoid, halt monster*)

###### Lair

A crumbling and abandoned watchtower has become the lair of a pack of **7 hobgholls**. At one time,
the hobgholls had been prized bodyguards of a hobgoblin chief, but after the chief lost his throne
to a rival the hobgholls were forced into exile.

**Hobgholls (7):** Spd 120’, AC 3, HD 3\*\*, hp 20, 18, 15, 15, 14, 12, 10, #AT 2 or 1 (2 claws or
weapon 8+), Dmg 1d3 {S} /1d3 {S} or 1d6+1 {W}, Save F3, ML +2, XP 80; Special: paralyzing claw,
regeneration

The hobgholls were able to carry off some loot when they were exiled, all of which is stored in the
basement of the watchtower. The loot includes seven small sacks with 1,000sp each; a small sack with
1,000gp; and their former chief’s ceremonial headdress, dangling with scrimshaw skulls (300gp
value).
