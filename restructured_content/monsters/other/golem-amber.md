### Golem, Amber

Amber golems are magical constructs made of petrified tree sap. Creating one involves the
employment of mighty magic by exceptionally powerful spellcasters. During the golem’s construction,
the golden stone is commonly formed into the shape of dire wolves, lions, tigers, or even yali. They
are typically about the same size as the animal they resemble.

Like most constructs, amber golems have no true intelligence. The magic that animates them imbues
them with just enough sapience to follow simple or standing orders from their creators.

###### Combat

When encountered, an amber golem’s reactions are always determined by its creator’s orders (even if
given long, long ago).

An amber golem can automatically **discern invisible** creatures and objects within 60’ (as the
spell). It can **track** as if it had three ranks of Tracking proficiency.

In combat, amber golems attack with a pair of claws and a fierce bite. If an amber golem charges a
creature and successfully hits it with both claws, it immediately **pounces** onthe creature. The
amber golem’s subsequent bite attack automatically hits and the creature that has been pounced on
must make a successful size-adjusted Paralysis saving throw or be knocked **prone**.

Amber golems are **immune** to enchantment effects, necrotic damage, poisonous damage, and all
mundane damage. As constructs, they count as enchanted creatures for purposes of spells such as
*dispel evil*and *holy circle*.

###### Ecology

As constructs, amber golems have no natural habitat. They can be found guarding ancient treasures,
dwarven vaults, or places of power or serving powerful spellcasters.

###### Spoils

A destroyed amber golem can be harvested with Magical Engineering for the following component:

* amber heart (37 3/6 st, 2,250gp, *discern evil, discern invisible, locate animal or plant,
physical protection (all)*)

###### Lore

*To reach the entrance to the Great Temple of Aryaman in Uttar, one must climb the Stairway of the
Thousand Steps. Atop this stairway, one finds the Golden Doors of the Great Temple, eternally
guarded by a pair of amber lions sejant. Though they might be mistaken for mere statues, the lions
are animate, and their stony gaze allows no passerby to go unnoticed, no matter how well disguised
by magic. Only the Anointed of the Dawn are permitted egress to the Great Temple; I was forbidden to
enter. But for the Tarkaun, the Golden doors opened, and he made sacrifice to Aryaman, whom we call
Ammonar.*
