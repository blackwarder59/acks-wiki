### Swarm, Fish

A fish swarm is a large school of carnivorous fish such as bluefish, barracudas, jackfish,
mackerel, or piranhas. A fish swarm might be roused into a feeding frenzy by the smell of blood or
unusual stimuli in the water.

###### Combat

Fish swarms have **acute olfaction.** They gain a +1 bonus to avoid surprise in their natural
habitat.

A fish swarm spreads over a watery volume of 1000 cubic feet per HD. A 2 HD swarm is usually 20’ x
10’ x 10’, a 3 HD swarm is 30’ x 10’ x 10’, and a 4 HD swarm is 20’ x 20’ x 10’. However it can
expand or shrink by 50% in either direction as conditions merit.

Fish swarms do not so much attack as simply engulf everything in their path. Any creature that
starts its initiative in the swarm’s area, or enters the swarm on its initiative, is **engulfed.**

If an engulfed creature is required to make a Swimming throw at the start of its initiative to
avoid drowning, the creature’s throw suffers a -1 penalty per HD of the fish swarm that has engulfed
him.

A creature engulfed by a fish swarm suffers 2 {P} damage, or 4 {P} damage if the engulfed creature
is unarmored and has a natural AC of 3 or less. If the engulfed creature is drowning, it suffers
double damage. The damage is dealt to the engulfed creature at the end of its initiative.

If, on its initiative, the engulfed creature uses its movement action to flee from the swarm at
least 20’, or uses its combat action to ward off the swarm with a weapon, it reduces the damage it
suffers from the swarm by half. Warding off a fish swarm with a weapon also deals 1d4 damage to the
swarm.

The engulfed condition ends when the creature starts its initiative outside the area of the swarm.

Fish swarms are **immune** to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, except when dealt by
creatures warding off the fish (e.g. the fish swarm cannot be directly attacked as a target).

###### Ecology

Fish are found everywhere and so are fish swarms. The specific type of fish can vary depending on
the terrain and circumstances of the encounter.

###### Spoils

Fish swarms do not yield any spoils except fish.
