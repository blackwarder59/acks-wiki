### Beetle, Giant Luminous

The giant luminous beetle is one of the most commonly encountered of the gargantuan beetles that
plague Aurëpos. These subterranean nocturnal insects are about 2 ½' in length and 75 lbs in weight
and are named for the luminescent organs that adorn it, two on the head and one on the abdomen. The
luminescent organs produce illumination within a 10' radius each.

###### Combat

Giant luminous beetles have **terrestrial mechanoreception** enabling them to sense vibration in
the ground over long distances equivalent to line of sight in full daylight. Spells or effects that
would ordinarily cause blindness do not affect the beetle when its using terrestrial
mechanoreception. However, creatures that are flying, levitating, or otherwise not touching the
ground are invisible to the sense. Terrestrial mechanoreception can penetrate structures and terrain
features.

Though not particularly aggressive, giant luminous beetles are immensely strong for their body
weight. A single bite of their razor-sharp mandibles can slay an ordinary man.

###### Ecology

When a nest of luminous beetles is encountered, there is a 10% chance per beetle that it will be
incubating a clutch of 2d6 eggs. The eggs have 1 hp and weigh 1/30 st. Beetle larvae are rarely
found in nests, because the larvae immediately disperse into the wild after they emerge from their
eggs.

###### Spoils

A slain luminous beetle can be harvested with Animal Husbandry 2 for the following components
useful in magic research:

* tumescent organs (1/6 st, 15gp, *illumination, kindle flame, perpetual illumination*)

If not used for magic research, the luminous beetles fetch 5gp and weigh 1/6 st. In either case,
the luminescent organs will continue to shed light for 1d6 days after being harvested.

###### Encounter

A mighty cedar tree, its trunk about 120’ in length and 7’ in diameter at its base, lies in the
grass here, felled by a lightning bolt. Troops of mushrooms sprout from the rotting wood along its
length. A hollow has been bored into the base of the trunk, from which a fiery glow flickers eerily.
The source of the glow is the **eight giant luminous beetles** which have made a nest in the tree
trunk.

**Giant luminous beetles (8)**: Spd 120’, AC 5, HD 1+2, hp 10, 10, 9, 7, 7, 5, 5, 4, #AT 1 (bite
9+), Dmg 2d4 {P}, Save F1, ML -1, AL N, XP 15

Scattered around the shattered tree are seven pieces of fulgurite (10gp each), a glassy gemstone
created by the lightning strike.
