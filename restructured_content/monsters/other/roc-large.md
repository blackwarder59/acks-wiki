### Roc, Large

Rocs are living symbols of the power and majesty of Ammonar, the Winged Sun, Empyrean god of light
and law. Large rocs resemble gigantic goshawks, with dark grey backs and wings with a pale grey
underbelly marked by fine black bands. The wingspan of these mighty birds stretches 110’ while their
great bodies weigh around 3,000 lbs.

Wise and long-lived, large rocs almost always have learned to speak both Common and Classical Auran
as well as their own screeching tongue. Large rocs are found in the primordial forests of Northern
and Southern Argollë and in the high Jutting and Meniri Mountains.

###### Combat

Rocs have **acute vision** and **alertness**, granting them a +2 bonus to avoid surprise in their
natural habitat.

Rocs are inherently lawful creatures. Chaotic characters encountering rocs suffer -2 penalty to
reaction rolls, while neutral characters suffer a -1 penalty.

A flying roc can make a **dive attack** with their talons. A dive attack inflicts double the normal
damage dice (2d8 {S} /2d8 {S}). If the roc hits a creature smaller than itself with both its talons
while making a dive attack, the creature must make a size-adjusted Paralysis saving throw. If the
save fails, the creature is **grabbed**.

###### Ecology

When large rocs are encountered in their aerie, there is a 15% chance each roc is guarding
offspring. Roll 1d4 for their number and age: 1-2, it’s 1d3 eggs, 3-4, it’s 1d3-1 juveniles.
Juvenile large rocs have the characteristics of small rocs. Large roc eggs have 1 hp and weigh 1 4/6
st.

###### Spoils

A slain large roc can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the
following components useful in magic research:

* beak (15 st, 900gp, *cataclysm, force of impetus, sharpness, striking*, weapon +1)
* eyes (8 st, 480gp, *lay of the land, locate distant object, locate place of power*)
* tail feathers (12 st, 720gp, *circling winds, gale of winds,* armor +2)

A large roc’s 6d10 flight feathers each fetch 7d6gp and weigh 1/4 st. Its two talons each fetch 8gp
and weigh 1/6 st.

Although sapient, rocs are difficult to train because of their sheer size, power, and speed. One
mistake can cause the would-be roc rider to die.
