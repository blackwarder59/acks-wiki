### Golem, Wood

Wood golems are 3’ to 5’ tall magical constructs made of blackwood, ironwood, hickory, oak or other
hardwoods, weighing about 100 lbs. Most wood golems are shaped to resemble dwarves, gnomes, or
beastmen. Creating one involves the employment of mighty magic by exceptionally powerful clerics and
mages.

Like most constructs, wood golems have no true intelligence. The magic that animates them imbues
them with just enough sapience to follow simple or standing orders from their creators.

###### Combat

When encountered, a wood golem’s reactions are always determined by its creator’s orders (even if
given long, long ago).

In combat, wood golems smash foes with a powerful punch or a weapon. However, they are **clumsy**
and suffer a -1 penalty to initiative rolls.

They are **immune** to enchantment effects; necrotic and poisonous damage; and all mundane damage
except fire damage. They are **susceptible** to fire damage. They make saving throws against fire
with a penalty of -2 and suffer double damage.

As constructs, they count as enchanted creatures for purposes of spells such as *dispel evil*and
*holy circle*.

###### Ecology

As constructs, wood golems have no natural habitat. They can be found guarding ancient treasures,
dwarven vaults, or places of power or serving powerful spellcasters.

###### Spoils

A destroyed wood golem can be harvested with Magical Engineering for the following component:

* heartwood (5/6 st, 50gp, *wall of wood, warp wood*)

###### Encounter

An ancient pagoda, made of lacquered dawn redwood, has been constructed in the middle of a 50’-wide
clearing. In the center of the pagoda is a blackwood statue of a blind gnomish wizard. The pagoda is
an *illuminated pinnacle of good*, dedicated to the god Istreus, and the statue is actually a **wood
golem** that will protect the pagoda from intruders who fail to display holy symbols of Istreus.

**Wood golem:** Spd 120’, AC 2, HD 2+2\*, hp 14, #AT 1 (smash 8+), Dmg 1d8 {W}, Save F1, ML N/A,
Special: construct immunities, mundane damage immunity, fire susceptibility

A trapdoor, hidden in the pagoda’s floor, contains a chest with 2,000sp of Argollëan mint, a silver
holy symbol of Istreus (50gp), and adawn redwood scroll case with a scroll of *discern magic*.
