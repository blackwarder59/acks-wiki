### Skeleton

The bones of the dead can be animated by dark magic, magic replacing muscle and sinew to enable the
skeleton to walk in a clattering parody of human mobility. Some of these animated skeletons are
created by necromantic magic, while others spawn from remains in sinkholes of evil.

Most skeletons are created from human bones, but the bones of other creatures can be used, provided
they are relatively intact. A skeleton created from non-human bones has a number of HD equal to what
the creature possessed in life (excluding class levels).

Despite their clattering animus, skeletons have only the barest flicker of sapience. Because of
their stupidity, any instructions given to a skeleton by its creator or controller must be very
simple. In the absence of orders or opponents, skeletons simply tumble to the ground in bony heaps.

Some skeleton are clad in nothing more than the rotting remnants of the clothing they wore in life,
but others are armored and armed by their evil masters. A skeleton wearing armor adds the AC bonus
to its own natural AC of 2.

###### Combat

Unless under another’s control, skeletons are automatically Hostile to any living creature they
encounter

Skeletons can attack with melee or missile weapons (if available) or with natural attacks.
Skeletons that had natural attacks when living retain their natural attacks. Skeletons that had no
natural attacks gain a bony claw attack dealing 1d6 {B} damage (plus an average of 2 {B} damage per
HD after 1 HD). Skeletons with more than 4+1 HD deal extraordinary damage.

Skeletons are **immune** to enchantment effects, necrotic damage, and poisonous damage. They are
inherently evil for purposes of *discern evil*and *holy circle*spells. Regardless of their HD, all
skeletons can be rebuked easily (e.g. as skeletons) by casters capable of doing so.

###### Ecology

Skeletons that were birthed in sinkholes of evil will usually be found lingering in the vicinity of
the sinkhole, unless the pursuit of living creatures draws them away. Skeletons that were created by
chaotic spellcasters are frequently found guarding locations or valuable treasure in dungeons.

###### Spoils

A destroyed skeleton can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for
the following component useful in magic research:

* skull (1/6 st, 13gp, *shrieking skull, undead legion*)
