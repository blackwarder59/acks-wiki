### Hippogriff

Hippogriffs are aggressive flying creatures crossbred from eagles and horses. Their forebody, front
legs, head, and wings are those of a giant eagle while their hindquarters, hind legs, and tail are
those of a horse. A typical hippogriff weighs around 1,000 lbs and measures 9' long with a wingspan
of 25'. Voracious omnivores, hippogriffs have a particular taste for pegasi meat, but will hunt
humanoids as readily as any other meal. As semi-sapient horse hybrids, they are much easier to train
than griffons.

###### Combat

Like eagles, hippogriffs have **acute vision** and **alertness**, granting them a +2 bonus to avoid
surprise in their natural habitat.

A flying hippogriff can make a **dive attack** with its talons. A dive attack inflict double the
normal damage (2d6 {S}/2d6 {S}). If the hippogriff hits a creature smaller than itself with both its
talons while making a dive attack, the creature must make a size-adjusted Paralysis saving throw. If
the save fails, the creature is **grabbed**. Grabbed creatures are usually carried off and eaten.

###### Ecology

Hippogriffs typically nest high in the mountains. When hippogriffs are encountered in their aerie,
there is a 25% chance each hippogriff is guarding offspring. Roll 1d4 for number and age: 1, it’s
1d3 eggs, 2-4 it’s 1 juvenile. Juvenile hippogriffs have AC 1, Spd 150’, HD 1+2, and attack with 2
talons (1d3 {S}) and 1 bite (1d6 {P}). They cannot fly. Hippogriff eggs have 1 hp and weigh 5/6 st.

Hippogriffs defending young do not have to make morale rolls; they always fight to the death.

###### Spoils

A slain hippogriff can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the
following components useful in magic research:

* beak (4/6 st, 45gp, *sharpness, striking, swift sword*)
* wingtips (4/6 st, 45gp, *flight winged flight*)

A hippogriff’s two talons each fetch 6gp and weigh 1/6 st and its 4d12 flight feathers each fetch
3d6gp and weigh 1/8 st.

###### Encounter

Six talus caves, each ranging from 1’ - 8’ high and wide, formed by piled granite boulders, are
scattered across the wooded hillside. These are the nests of **11 hippogriffs**. Hidden among the
caves are **5 hippogriff eggs** and **6 hippogriff fledglings**. The hippogriffs will defend their
offspring to the death.

Hippogriffs (11): Spd 180’/360’ fly, AC 4, HD 3+1, hp 15 each, #AT 3 (2 claws/bite 7+), Dmg 1d6 {S}
/ 1d6 {S} / 1d10 {P}, Save F2, ML 0, AL N, XP 90; Special: dive attack

Hippogriff Fledglings (6): Spd 150’, AC 1, HD 1+2, hp 6 each, #AT 3 (2 claws/bite 7+), Dmg 1d3 {S}
/ 1d3 {S} /1d6 {P}, Save F0, ML 0, AL N, XP 15

The hippogriffs have no treasure apart from their offspring.
