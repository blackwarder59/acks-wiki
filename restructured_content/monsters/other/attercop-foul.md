### Attercop, Foul

Foul attercops are remote relatives of the demonic attercops, the demonic ichor having greatly
weakened through hundreds of generations of breeding with giant spiders of the mortal sort. These
creatures are 5’ long and weigh about 125 lbs. Like their progenitors, these arachnid horrors dwell
in the fetid swamps, dark forests, and high mountains of the wild.

Attercops are sapient and speak their own horrific language. Scholars who have studied Ancient
Zaharan, Khepri, and Thrassian find certain similarities in the attercop tongue.

###### Combat

Foul attercops are ambush predators, and creatures encountering attercops suffer a -2 penalty to
surprise rolls due to the spiders’ **natural stealth**.

Their bites carry a dangerous **paralytic venom.** A creature damaged by a foul attercop’s bite
must make a Death saving throw with a +2 bonus. If the save succeeds, the creature is not affected
by the venom. If the save fails, then creature suffers 2d6 {P} damage and becomes **paralyzed** for
2d4 turns at the end of the attercop’s initiative. The paralysis can be cured by *neutralize poison*
but not *cure light injury.* When the paralysis wears off, the poisoned creature is **fatigued**.
The fatigue ends if the poison is neutralized or after the creature enjoys 8 hours of restful sleep.

To aid in ambush, attercops spin webs in strategic locations around their lairs. They use these
webs to entangle victims in their webs in order to capture them and keep them fresh for later
consumption. They can also spin a web around a target as a melee attack. If a creature moves into an
attercop’s web, or if an attercop succeeds on a webspinning attack throw against a creature, that
creature becomes **webbed.**

The foul attercops’ **webbed mechanoreception** enables them to “see” any creatures touching their
webs.

###### Ecology

Foul attercops can reproduce with any other attercops; the mother determines the resultant
offspring. When encountered in a den, there is a 10% chance per foul attercop that it will be
guarding a clutch of 2d4 eggs. Foul attercop eggs have 1 hp and weigh 1/6 st.

###### Spoils

A slain foul attercop can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for
the following components useful in magic research:

* mandibles (1/6 st, 12gp, *poison*)
* leg tarsus (1/6 st, 12gp, *spider climb*)
* spinneret (2/6 st, 16gp, *chameleon, webbing*)

If not used for magic research, a foul attercop’s mandibles fetch 8gp and weigh 1/6 st. Its venom
(onset time of 1 turn, +6 saving modifier, paralysis for 1d4 turns and 1d6 {Po} damage on failed
Death saving throw) fetches 125gp and weighs 1/6 st.
