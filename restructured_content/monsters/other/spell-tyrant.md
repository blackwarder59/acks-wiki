### Spell Tyrant

A spell tyrant, also known as a sorcerous sphere, is the abominable offspring of arcane
experimentation. An adult spell tyrant resembles a floating sphere some 3’ in diameter and 820lbs in
weight, with thick, gnarled, flesh pulsating with purple veins. The front of the sphere is set with
a dozen pale eyes and multitude of maws with twisted fangs. Dotted around the sphere, six tentacle
limbs twist obscenely, each tipped with a prehensile hand.

Though intelligent, malevolent, and megalomaniacal, spell tyrants are still capable of cooperating
with evil allies or directing henchmen and underlings, when it furthers their interests. Even under
duress, however, they are unwilling to bear the company of others of their kind.

###### Combat

An adult spell tyrant has all the abilities of a 12th-level Mage, including magic research,
proficiencies, and item use. A spell tyrant can cast up to 3 spells simultaneously (1 spell per pair
of limbs, for tyrants of other ages). Instead of casting spells, it can wield magical items instead.
Its limbs are too weak to make effective physical attacks, however.

If forced into melee, adult spell tyrants can lunge and bite with 1d4 maws per round, dealing 1d4
{P!} damage with each. However, they engaging in physical combat reluctantly, and would rather
strike with spells and magical items from a safe vantage point or distance.

Due to their ancestral memories, adult spell tyrants have Loremastery with a target value of 7+ (19
– HD for tyrants of other ages).

###### Ecology

Spell tyrants live solitary lives. Over their long lifespans, they continuously grow in size,
adding additional eyes, mouths, and limbs. When they reach maximum age, they rupture into 6 baby
sorcerous spheres, each with but a pair of vestigial limbs. The newborn spell tyros each retain a
fraction of their former memories and spells; as they re-grow, they will remember more and more of
their prior lives even as they accumulate new secrets and lore.

Spell tyrants are born remembering one language. Each time they gain a limb pair, they remember a
new language.
