### Grimlock

Grimlocks are hideous eyeless humanoids that dwell in the lightless subterranean depths. They are
virtually never seen on the surface, and few sages are even aware of their existence; of those that
are, most believe that “grimlocks are to morlocks what morlocks are to men: twisted and degenerate
dwellers of the underdark below.”

Only those who have plumbed the darkest of the ancient annals know the truth: The grimlocks were
created as a servitor race by the khepri (see p. XX), who crossbred morlocks with various
subterranean creatures. They were made eyeless so that the khepri could freely expose their true
faces without driving their minions to madness. Since the destruction of the khepri kingdoms, the
grimlocks have eked out a savage existence.

The Grimlock tongue is a debased dialect of Khepri. Leaders have a 10% chance per HD of knowing the
language of another subterranean species, such as dwarves, morlocks, or troglodytes.

###### Combat

Grimlocks have **dull gray skin** that resembles stone. Characters encountering grimlocks in
mountains or underground have a -2 penalty to surprise rolls.

Though grimlocks are **blind**, they possess **echolocation** (120’)that enable them to easily
navigate the world around them.No spells or effects that would ordinarily blind a creature will
affect a grimlock, but *inaudible* creatures are hidden from them, and *noiselessness* blinds them.

###### Ecology

Each grimlock gang will be led by a champion with 3 AC, 3 HD, 16 hp, and a +2 damage bonus. Each
grimlock warband will be led by a sub-chieftain with 4 AC, 4 HD, 20 hp, and a +2 damage bonus. A
grimlock lair or vault will be led by a chieftain with 5 AC, 6 HD, 28 hp, and a +3 damage bonus. As
long as the chieftain is alive, the grimlocks will gain a +2 bonus to morale rolls. Grimlock lairs
and vaults will have drudges and whelps equal to 100% and 200% of the number of warriors,
respectively. Grimlock drudges fight as morlocks, while grimlock whelps have AC 0, Spd 90’, 1 hp, ML
-4, and do not fight.

When grimlocks are encountered in a vault, certain additional creatures will be present. There is a
50% chance for 1d10 enslaved captives per warband. In addition, a vault has a 50% chance of a shaman
being present, and a 25% chance of a witch doctor. A shaman is equivalent to sub-chieftain
statistically, but has Shaman abilities at level 1d6. A witch doctor is equivalent to a champion
statistically, but has Mage abilities at level 1d4. Finally, there is a 5% chance that a khepri will
be present, ruling over the grimlocks.
