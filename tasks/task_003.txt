# Task ID: 3
# Title: Search and Navigation System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement comprehensive search functionality with filters and develop intuitive navigation system optimized for mobile gaming.
# Details:
Integrate Fuse.js for client-side fuzzy search. Implement real-time search with results appearing as user types. Create filters for content types (monsters, spells, classes, equipment, domain rules, judge tools) and ACKS-specific attributes (spell level, character level, monster HD, class type). Add search suggestions and autocomplete functionality. Develop breadcrumb navigation showing content hierarchy. Create mobile-optimized menu with swipe gestures. Implement bookmark system using local storage. Add recently viewed content tracking. Ensure all navigation elements have proper accessibility attributes.

# Test Strategy:
Test search performance with the full dataset, ensuring results appear within 100ms. Verify filters correctly narrow search results. Test navigation on various mobile devices and screen sizes. Validate bookmarking and history features persist correctly. Conduct accessibility testing on navigation elements. Test keyboard navigation for all interactive elements.
