# Title: Fix client-side fs module import causing Next.js application crash
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 14
# Priority: high
# Description: Resolve the critical issue where an improper import of the Node.js fs module on the client side is causing the entire Next.js application to crash.
# Details:
The application is currently broken due to an attempt to import the Node.js file system (fs) module on the client side. This is a common issue in Next.js applications since the fs module is only available in Node.js environment and not in browsers. The fix requires:

1. Identify all instances where the fs module is being imported without proper environment checks
2. Modify these imports to either:
   - Use dynamic imports with isomorphic checks (typeof window === 'undefined')
   - Move fs operations to server-side components, API routes, or getStaticProps/getServerSideProps functions
   - Replace with browser-compatible alternatives if client-side file operations are needed
3. Implement proper error handling for any file operations
4. Ensure any components using fs are properly marked as server components in Next.js 13+ using the 'use server' directive or file naming convention
5. Check for any third-party libraries that might be indirectly importing fs

Special attention should be paid to any data fetching logic that might be running in both server and client environments.

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify the application successfully builds without errors using 'next build'
2. Test application startup in development mode with 'next dev' and ensure no console errors related to fs module
3. Test application in production mode with 'next start' to confirm fixes work in the production build
4. Perform comprehensive testing of all application routes and features, especially those that previously used file system operations
5. Test the application on different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) to ensure cross-browser compatibility
6. Implement specific unit tests for components that were modified to handle the fs module differently
7. Test edge cases such as slow connections and server errors to ensure proper fallbacks are in place
8. Verify that any server-side file operations still function correctly after the changes
9. Run Lighthouse performance tests to ensure the fix doesn't negatively impact performance
10. Set up monitoring to detect any similar issues in the future
