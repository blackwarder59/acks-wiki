# Task ID: 16
# Title: Implement Judges Journal Wiki Reorganization by Parts and Chapters
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Restructure the Judges Journal wiki according to the reorganization plan, organizing content into five main Parts with constituent chapters, while ensuring proper navigation and content sourcing.
# Details:
This task involves implementing the Judges Journal reorganization as specified in JUDGES_JOURNAL_REORG_PLAN.md. The developer should:

1. Create five main section pages corresponding to the Parts of the Judges Journal:
   - Part 1: Praxis
   - Part 2: Construction
   - Part 3: Abstraction
   - Part 4: Customization
   - Part 5: Appendices

2. For each Part, create individual pages for all constituent chapters as outlined in the reorganization plan.

3. Content population:
   - Source content from the main Judges Journal file for each chapter
   - Incorporate any existing granular files that contain chapter-specific content
   - Ensure all content maintains proper formatting, headings, and structure
   - Preserve any existing cross-references between sections

4. Implement navigation features:
   - Add a main navigation menu/sidebar that shows all Parts
   - Create sub-navigation within each Part showing its chapters
   - Add 'Previous/Next' navigation at the bottom of each chapter
   - Ensure breadcrumb navigation works correctly

5. Prepare for future enhancements:
   - Add placeholder sections for images and diagrams where appropriate
   - Document locations where cross-references will need to be updated
   - Create a consistent heading structure that will support future TOC generation

6. Update any existing links to Judges Journal content to point to the new structure

The implementation should follow wiki best practices and maintain a consistent look and feel throughout the reorganized content.

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify both structure and content integrity:

1. Structure validation:
   - Confirm all five Parts exist as main sections
   - Verify each Part contains all chapters specified in the reorganization plan
   - Check that navigation elements (sidebar, breadcrumbs, prev/next links) work correctly
   - Validate that the hierarchy is properly represented in the wiki structure

2. Content validation:
   - Compare content of each chapter against source material to ensure no information was lost
   - Verify formatting is preserved (headings, lists, tables, code blocks, etc.)
   - Check that any internal links between sections still function correctly
   - Ensure images or other media are properly referenced

3. User journey testing:
   - Test navigation paths through the content, ensuring a user can logically move through the material
   - Verify that a user can navigate from the main wiki to any specific chapter in 3 clicks or fewer
   - Test breadcrumb navigation to ensure users can understand their location in the document hierarchy

4. Cross-browser testing:
   - Verify the reorganized structure displays correctly in Chrome, Firefox, and Safari
   - Check mobile responsiveness of the new structure

5. Peer review:
   - Have another team member navigate the reorganized content without prior instruction to verify intuitiveness
