# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement Search and Filtering System for Monster Database
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a robust search and filtering system for the monster database to allow users to quickly find specific monsters based on various attributes and keywords.
# Details:
Building on the successful monster viewing system, implement a comprehensive search and filtering functionality that enhances user experience:

**Completed Features:**
- Real-time search bar at top of monsters page
- Search matches monster name, type, and description
- Filters all 167 monsters as user types
- Results count display (e.g., "Showing 15 of 167 monsters")
- No results messaging with helpful text
- Responsive design across all devices
- Optimized client-side performance without lag
- Search state management with React hooks
- Case-insensitive matching
- Multi-attribute search (name, type, description)
- Clear visual feedback for filtered results
- Mobile-optimized interface

**Remaining Work:**
1. Implement advanced filter controls:
   - Category dropdown filter
   - Hit dice range slider or min/max inputs
   - Movement type checkboxes
   - Alignment options if applicable
2. Implement URL parameter support so filtered/searched results can be bookmarked or shared
3. Add clear filters button to reset all search parameters
4. Enhance filter UI components for better user experience
5. Ensure new filter controls maintain the existing responsive design
6. Integrate new filters with the existing search functionality
7. Update the UI to accommodate the additional filter controls without cluttering the interface

The implementation should build upon the existing React state management for filter values and continue to apply the filtering logic efficiently without unnecessary re-renders.

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify both functionality and performance of the search and filtering system:

1. Unit tests:
   - Test the new advanced filter controls for correct filtering
   - Verify combinations of search and filters produce expected results
   - Test edge cases for the new filter controls

2. Integration tests:
   - Verify URL parameters correctly restore filter and search state
   - Test that new filter UI controls update the monster list correctly
   - Confirm interaction between search and filters works as expected

3. Performance tests:
   - Measure render time with various filter combinations
   - Verify adding multiple filters doesn't impact the current performance
   - Test with simulated slow connections to ensure reasonable performance with all filters active

4. User acceptance testing:
   - Create specific test scenarios for users to follow:
     * Find all undead monsters
     * Find monsters with 3+ hit dice that can fly
     * Search for monsters containing specific text in their description
     * Test bookmarking and sharing filtered results via URL parameters
   - Verify the UI remains intuitive with the addition of new filter controls

5. Cross-browser and responsive testing:
   - Verify new filter controls display and function correctly across devices
   - Test on at least Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
   - Ensure mobile experience remains optimized with the additional filters
