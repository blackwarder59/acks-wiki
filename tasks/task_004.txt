# Description: Build components for displaying different content types with responsive design and implement cross-reference linking system.
# Details:
Create React components for displaying each content type: MonsterCard, SpellList, ClassDescription, EquipmentTable, etc. Ensure all components are responsive and maintain readability on mobile devices. Implement the cross-reference system that automatically links related content. Create hover tooltips that show quick previews of referenced content. Add bidirectional linking (backlinks). Ensure tables render correctly across all devices. Implement lazy loading for images with appropriate placeholders. Add copy-to-clipboard functionality for stat blocks and descriptions. Ensure all components follow the design principles and color scheme specified in the PRD.

# Test Strategy:
Test components with various content examples to ensure correct rendering. Verify responsive behavior across different screen sizes. Test cross-reference links to confirm they resolve to the correct content. Check tooltip functionality and content preview accuracy. Validate accessibility of all components with screen readers. Test image lazy loading behavior with throttled network connections.
