# Task ID: 4
# Title: Content Display Components
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Build components for displaying different content types with responsive design and implement cross-reference linking system.
# Details:
Create React components for displaying each content type: MonsterCard, SpellList, ClassDescription, EquipmentTable, etc. Ensure all components are responsive and maintain readability on mobile devices. Implement the cross-reference system that automatically links related content. Create hover tooltips that show quick previews of referenced content. Add bidirectional linking (backlinks). Ensure tables render correctly across all devices. Implement lazy loading for images with appropriate placeholders. Add copy-to-clipboard functionality for stat blocks and descriptions. Ensure all components follow the design principles and color scheme specified in the PRD.

# Test Strategy:
Test components with various content examples to ensure correct rendering. Verify responsive behavior across different screen sizes. Test cross-reference links to confirm they resolve to the correct content. Check tooltip functionality and content preview accuracy. Validate accessibility of all components with screen readers. Test image lazy loading behavior with throttled network connections.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Base Content Display Components [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop the foundational React components for displaying different content types with consistent styling and layout structure.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create base component templates for MonsterCard, SpellList, ClassDescription, EquipmentTable, and RuleSection
2. Implement responsive container layouts for each component using CSS Grid/Flexbox
3. Define consistent typography, spacing, and color variables following the PRD
4. Create skeleton loading states for each component
5. Implement basic error handling for missing content
6. Set up component story files for development and testing

Testing approach:
- Create unit tests for each component with various data inputs
- Test responsive behavior using different viewport sizes
- Verify components render correctly with missing or malformed data

## 2. Implement Mobile-Responsive Table Components [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Create specialized table components that maintain readability and usability across all device sizes, with particular focus on mobile optimization.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create a responsive table component with horizontal scrolling for wide tables
2. Implement collapsible rows for complex data on mobile devices
3. Add column prioritization to hide less important columns on smaller screens
4. Create card-view alternative for tables on mobile devices
5. Implement sortable columns with appropriate mobile interactions
6. Add zebra striping and appropriate spacing for readability

Testing approach:
- Test tables with various column counts and data densities
- Verify readability on mobile devices (320px width minimum)
- Test touch interactions for sorting and expanding collapsed rows
- Ensure accessibility standards are met with proper ARIA attributes

## 3. Build Cross-Reference Linking System [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Develop the core system for automatically identifying and linking related content across different components.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create a content reference parser that identifies references in text (e.g., spell names, monster names)
2. Implement a link generation system that creates appropriate links to referenced content
3. Build a reference registry to track all cross-references for bidirectional linking
4. Create a LinkableText component that wraps text content and processes references
5. Implement reference validation to handle missing or invalid references
6. Add configuration options for controlling reference behavior

Testing approach:
- Test with various text patterns to ensure correct reference detection
- Verify links point to correct content
- Test edge cases like nested references or references in headings
- Benchmark performance with large text blocks containing many references

## 4. Implement Hover Tooltips and Previews [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.3
### Description: Create an interactive tooltip system that shows quick previews of referenced content when hovering over links.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create a TooltipProvider component to manage tooltip state and positioning
2. Implement content preview components for each content type (condensed versions)
3. Add hover detection with appropriate delays and touch alternatives
4. Implement smart positioning to keep tooltips within viewport
5. Add loading states for asynchronously loaded preview content
6. Implement keyboard navigation for accessibility

Testing approach:
- Test tooltip positioning in various viewport sizes and scroll positions
- Verify touch interactions work correctly on mobile devices
- Test keyboard accessibility
- Ensure tooltips don't cause layout shifts or performance issues
- Test with screen readers to verify accessibility

## 5. Implement Lazy Loading and Performance Optimizations [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1, 4.2
### Description: Add lazy loading for images and heavy content with appropriate placeholders to improve performance.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Implement lazy loading for images using Intersection Observer API
2. Create appropriate placeholder components for each content type
3. Add progressive image loading for larger images
4. Implement virtualization for long lists (e.g., spell lists, equipment tables)
5. Add code-splitting for larger component trees
6. Implement memoization for expensive rendering operations

Testing approach:
- Measure and compare performance metrics before and after implementation
- Test loading behavior on slow connections
- Verify placeholder appearance during loading
- Test scroll performance with large data sets
- Ensure accessibility is maintained with lazy-loaded content

## 6. Add Interactive Features and Backlinks [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1, 4.3, 4.4
### Description: Implement copy-to-clipboard functionality, bidirectional linking (backlinks), and final polish for all components.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Implement copy-to-clipboard functionality for stat blocks and descriptions
2. Add visual feedback for copied content
3. Create a backlink display component showing where current content is referenced
4. Implement backlink aggregation using the reference registry
5. Add sorting and filtering options for backlinks
6. Perform final accessibility and responsive design review

Testing approach:
- Test copy functionality across different browsers
- Verify backlinks are correctly aggregated and displayed
- Test with screen readers and keyboard navigation
- Perform end-to-end testing of the complete content display system
- Conduct user testing to verify usability of all features
