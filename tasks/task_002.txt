# Task ID: 2
# Title: Content Processing System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop TypeScript interfaces and parsing functions to process ACKS II markdown content into structured JSON data.
# Details:
Create TypeScript interfaces for all content types (monsters, spells, classes, equipment) based on the examples in the PRD. Develop parsing functions that can extract structured data from markdown files. Implement a content processing pipeline that handles the different content categories (Rulebook, Judges_Journal, Monstrous_Manual). Create utility functions to handle special formatting, tables, and embedded images. Generate JSON output files for each content type that will be used by the application. Implement validation to ensure data integrity and completeness. Set up scripts to batch process all content files.

# Test Strategy:
Test parsing functions with sample content from each category. Validate output JSON against expected structure. Check for data integrity issues like missing fields or malformed content. Measure processing performance for large batches of files. Verify all cross-references are correctly identified and preserved.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define TypeScript Interfaces for Content Types [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for all ACKS II content types based on the PRD examples.
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Analyze the PRD examples for each content type (monsters, spells, classes, equipment)
2. Define base interfaces for common properties across content types
3. Create specific interfaces for each content type with appropriate property types:
   - Monster interface (stats, abilities, attacks, etc.)
   - Spell interface (level, range, duration, effects, etc.)
   - Character Class interface (requirements, abilities, progression tables, etc.)
   - Equipment interface (cost, weight, damage, properties, etc.)
4. Define enum types for categorical data (e.g., monster types, spell schools)
5. Include JSDoc comments for all interfaces
6. Create a test file with sample objects that implement each interface
7. Ensure interfaces account for edge cases like optional properties

Testing approach: Create sample objects that implement each interface and verify TypeScript compilation succeeds without errors.

Based on your implementation report, I'll add these technical details to enhance the subtask:

Additional implementation notes:
- Organized interfaces in a hierarchical structure with BaseContent as the foundation
- Implemented discriminated unions with 'type' property for type-safe content handling
- Added specialized sub-interfaces for complex properties (e.g., MonsterAttack, SpellEffect)
- Created utility types for content collections and search functionality:
  ```typescript
  export type ContentCollection<T extends BaseContent> = {
    items: T[];
    index: Record<string, number>;
  };
  
  export type SearchResult<T extends BaseContent> = {
    item: T;
    relevance: number;
    matchedFields: string[];
  };
  ```
- Included robust error handling types for parsing operations:
  ```typescript
  export interface ParseError {
    message: string;
    line?: number;
    column?: number;
    source?: string;
  }
  ```
- Added strict null checking and undefined handling for optional properties
- Implemented readonly properties where appropriate to prevent accidental mutations
- Used TypeScript's utility types (Pick, Omit, Partial) for interface composition
- Added string literal types for enumerated values to ensure type safety

## 2. Implement Markdown Parsing Functions [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Develop core parsing functions to extract structured data from markdown files for different content types.
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Set up a markdown parsing library (e.g., marked or remark)
2. Create a base parser class/function with common parsing logic
3. Implement specialized parsing functions for each content type:
   - parseMonster(markdown: string): Monster
   - parseSpell(markdown: string): Spell
   - parseClass(markdown: string): CharacterClass
   - parseEquipment(markdown: string): Equipment
4. Develop regex patterns to identify and extract key sections and properties
5. Implement error handling for malformed markdown
6. Create helper functions for common parsing tasks (e.g., extracting property lists, parsing stat blocks)
7. Add logging to track parsing progress and issues

Testing approach: Create unit tests with sample markdown snippets for each content type and verify the parsed output matches expected structure.

## 3. Build Content Processing Pipeline [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.2
### Description: Implement a processing pipeline that handles different content categories and orchestrates the parsing workflow.
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Create a pipeline class/module that manages the end-to-end processing
2. Implement content category detection (Rulebook, Judges_Journal, Monstrous_Manual)
3. Develop file reading utilities to load markdown content from the filesystem
4. Create a content router that directs content to appropriate parsers based on category and content type
5. Implement a processing queue to handle batches of content
6. Add progress tracking and reporting
7. Implement error recovery to continue processing despite individual file failures
8. Create hooks for pre-processing and post-processing steps

Testing approach: Create integration tests with sample directory structures containing different content categories and verify the pipeline correctly processes and routes each file type.

## 4. Develop Special Formatting and Table Utilities [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.2
### Description: Create utility functions to handle special markdown formatting, tables, and embedded images.
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Implement table parsing functions to convert markdown tables to structured data
   - Support for different table formats (simple, complex, nested)
   - Handle column headers and row spans
2. Create utilities for processing special formatting:
   - Bold/italic text extraction
   - Bullet and numbered lists
   - Block quotes and callouts
3. Develop image reference extraction and processing
   - Extract image paths and captions
   - Handle relative paths and convert to appropriate format
4. Implement functions to process special ACKS II notation (e.g., dice notation, range formats)
5. Create utilities to handle cross-references between content items
6. Develop functions to normalize text (remove extra whitespace, standardize formatting)

Testing approach: Create specialized unit tests for each utility function with various edge cases (complex tables, nested formatting, etc.) and verify correct transformation.

6. Add support for different output formats (single file per item, collection files)
7. Implement versioning for output files
8. Create functions to merge related content (e.g., monsters with their abilities)

Testing approach: Create validation test suites with both valid and invalid sample data, verify validation correctly identifies issues, and confirm output files match expected structure.

## 6. Create Batch Processing Scripts [pending]
