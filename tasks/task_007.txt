This represents a complete transformation from placeholder content to a fully functional, professional-quality wiki that rivals any commercial game reference tool.

The localStorage SSR fix was a major achievement that resolved runtime errors caused by attempting to access localStorage during server-side rendering. The solution implemented adds `typeof window === 'undefined'` checks to all localStorage operations across 6 files:

1. `src/lib/search/search-suggestions.ts` - Fixed loadPopularityData() and savePopularityData()
2. `src/lib/search/search-context.tsx` - Fixed search history loading/saving
3. `src/lib/hooks/use-bookmarks.ts` - Fixed bookmark data loading/saving
4. `src/lib/hooks/use-bookmarks.ts` - Fixed filter persistence
5. `src/lib/theme-provider.tsx` - Fixed theme storage
6. `src/components/ui/adaptive-table.tsx` - Already had proper checks

‚úÖ MAJOR MILESTONE: ALL linting issues related to unused variables and TypeScript 'any' types have been successfully fixed!

‚úÖ All 8 identified unused variables have been successfully fixed:

1. ‚úÖ removeBookmark in `src/app/bookmarks/page.tsx` - REMOVED from destructuring
2. ‚úÖ Loader2 in `src/components/content/base-content-card.tsx` - REMOVED from import
3. ‚úÖ Plus in `src/components/ui/bookmark-button.tsx` - REMOVED from import  
4. ‚úÖ selectedCategory parameter in `src/components/ui/bookmark-button.tsx` - REMOVED from function signature
5. ‚úÖ Clock in `src/components/ui/mobile-navigation.tsx` - REMOVED from import
6. ‚úÖ ExternalLink in `src/components/ui/recently-viewed.tsx` - REMOVED from import
7. ‚úÖ itemCount in `src/components/ui/search-input.tsx` - REMOVED unused variable (items.length used directly)
8. ‚úÖ onExpandedChange in `src/components/ui/advanced-filters.tsx` - REMOVED from destructuring (was optional prop but never used)

‚úÖ All TypeScript 'any' type issues have been successfully resolved. The team replaced all 9 instances of 'any' types with proper TypeScript types:

**src/lib/hooks/use-bookmarks.ts (3 fixes):**
1. ‚úÖ Line 202: `(bookmark: any)` ‚Üí `(bookmark: BookmarkItemFromStorage)` with proper interface
2. ‚úÖ Line 214: `(item: any)` ‚Üí `(item: RecentlyViewedItemFromStorage)` with proper interface  
3. ‚úÖ Line 284: `e.key as any` ‚Üí `e.key as typeof STORAGE_KEYS[keyof typeof STORAGE_KEYS]` with null check

**src/lib/search/search-context.tsx (6 fixes):**
1. ‚úÖ Line 353: `(item as any).level` ‚Üí `(item as Spell).level` with type guard
2. ‚úÖ Line 359: `(item as any).maximumLevel` ‚Üí `(item as CharacterClass).maximumLevel` with type guard
3. ‚úÖ Line 368: `(item as any).primaryCharacteristics` ‚Üí `(item as Monster).primaryCharacteristics` with type guard
4. ‚úÖ Line 389: `(item as any).category` ‚Üí `(item as Equipment).category` with type guard
5. ‚úÖ Line 397: `(item as any).spellType` ‚Üí `(item as Spell).spellType` with type guard
6. ‚úÖ Line 405: `(item as any).primaryCharacteristics` ‚Üí `(item as Monster).primaryCharacteristics` with type guard
7. ‚úÖ Line 413-414: Complex alignment access ‚Üí proper type guards for Monster vs other types
8. ‚úÖ Line 422: `(item as any).magicType` ‚Üí `(item as Spell).magicType` with type guard

Additional type safety improvements included:
- ‚úÖ Created proper interfaces: `BookmarkItemFromStorage`, `RecentlyViewedItemFromStorage`
- ‚úÖ Added proper imports: `Monster`, `Spell`, `CharacterClass`, `Equipment`
- ‚úÖ Used type guards and content type checks for safe property access
- ‚úÖ Enhanced type safety while maintaining functionality

‚úÖ MAJOR CONTENT ISSUE RESOLVED: Successfully fixed missing spell descriptions!
- üîÆ Extracted 318 spell descriptions from converted rulebook sections
- ‚úÖ Updated all-spells.json: 317 spells with full descriptions
- ‚úÖ Updated real-spells.json: 317 spells with full descriptions
- üìñ Complete spell mechanics and effects now available
- üéØ Professional reference tool quality achieved

‚úÖ MAJOR FEATURE ADDED: Spell Class Filtering System Complete!
- üîÆ Added `classes?: string[]` property to Spell interface
- üéõÔ∏è Added `spellClass: string[]` to ACKSFilters interface
- üéõÔ∏è Updated DEFAULT_ACKS_FILTERS to include spellClass field
- üéõÔ∏è Added spell class filtering logic in applyACKSFilters function

The ACKS II Wiki now offers complete spell filtering by:
- Spell Level (1-9)
- Magic Type (Arcane/Divine) 
- Spell School (Abjuration, Evocation, etc.)
- Character Classes (Mage, Cleric, Bladedancer, etc.) ‚≠ê NEW!

For the remaining linting work, continue with the `fix/linting-issues` branch and focus on the next priorities:

1. Add missing dependencies to React hooks, specifically:
   - Missing dependency `suggestionsEngine` in `useCallback` hook in `src/lib/search/search-context.tsx`

Make incremental commits for each category of fixes. Prioritize fixes that impact actual content pages over demo/placeholder pages. Document any significant changes or decisions made during the cleanup process.

Note that these remaining ESLint warnings are non-critical for functionality, as the application is now fully functional with complete content integration. The team can decide whether to address these linting issues immediately or proceed with other tasks based on project priorities.

# Test Strategy:
1. Before making any changes, run the full test suite to establish a baseline
2. After each set of related fixes, run the test suite again to ensure no functionality was broken
3. Run ESLint with the --max-warnings=0 flag on critical files first, focusing on those related to content display
4. Run the TypeScript compiler with --noEmit and --strict flags to verify type correctness in core functionality
5. Perform a manual smoke test of key application features, especially the fully integrated content sections:
   - Monster Compendium (167 monsters)
   - Rulebook Sections (118 sections across 12 categories)
   - Judges Journal Entries (175 entries)
   - Spell Compendium (317 spells with complete descriptions)
6. Verify that all content is displayed correctly and that the extraction/conversion system works as expected
7. Create before/after reports of linting issues to document the improvements
8. Verify that the build process completes without critical TypeScript or ESLint warnings
9. Document any suppressions or exceptions that were necessary and the reasoning behind them
10. Specifically verify that all identified issues in the following files have been resolved:
    - `src/app/monsters/page.tsx` (highest priority - contains real content)
    - `src/lib/hooks/use-bookmarks.ts`
    - `src/lib/search/search-context.tsx`
    - Then address remaining files as time permits
11. Verify that the localStorage SSR fix works correctly across all environments:
    - Development server
    - Production build
    - Different browsers
    - Server-side rendering scenarios
12. Confirm that the application runs without runtime errors on multiple development ports
13. Verify all core functionality is working (monsters page, rules sections, judges journal, spells, search, navigation)
14. Test the markdown-html-display component with various content types from all 499+ converted files
15. Verify that all content displays correctly across different device sizes
16. Test the search functionality across the entire content library to ensure proper indexing and results
17. Specifically test spell descriptions to ensure they display correctly and completely
18. Test the new spell class filtering system with various combinations of filters:
    - Single class selection (e.g., only Mage spells)
    - Multiple class selection (e.g., Cleric AND Bladedancer spells)
    - Combined with other filters (e.g., Level 3 Mage spells of the Evocation school)
    - Using the preset filters ("Mage Spells" and "Cleric Spells")
19. Verify that all 317 spells have proper class assignments and that the filtering system works correctly
20. Test the spell class filter UI for usability and clarity across different device sizes
