# Task ID: 5
# Title: Performance Optimization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Optimize application for fast loading and responsive interface, meeting performance benchmarks specified in the PRD.
# Details:
Implement Static Site Generation (SSG) for optimal performance. Configure image optimization with Next.js Image component. Add code splitting to reduce initial bundle size. Implement lazy loading for components and routes. Set up service worker for offline functionality. Optimize search index for faster queries. Configure proper caching strategies. Minimize CSS and JavaScript bundles. Implement preloading for critical resources. Add error boundaries and loading states for better user experience. Optimize fonts and icons for performance. Ensure bundle size remains under 500KB as specified in the PRD.

# Test Strategy:
Run Lighthouse audits targeting 90+ scores for Performance, Accessibility, SEO, and Best Practices. Measure Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS) against targets. Test page load times on 3G connection (target < 2s). Verify search response times (target < 100ms). Test offline functionality with service worker. Analyze JavaScript bundle size and composition. Test performance on low-end mobile devices.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Static Site Generation (SSG) [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Configure Next.js for Static Site Generation to pre-render pages at build time for optimal performance
### Details:
1. Identify pages suitable for SSG in the application
2. Implement getStaticProps for data fetching at build time
3. Configure getStaticPaths for dynamic routes with fallback strategy
4. Set up incremental static regeneration where appropriate
5. Measure and document Time to First Byte (TTFB) improvements
6. Testing approach: Compare Lighthouse scores before and after implementation, verify TTFB < 100ms, ensure content doesn't flicker on load

## 2. Optimize Images and Assets [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Implement Next.js Image component and optimize all static assets to reduce page load time
### Details:
1. Replace all <img> tags with Next.js Image component
2. Configure image sizes, quality, and formats (WebP/AVIF)
3. Implement responsive images with appropriate srcsets
4. Set up proper width and height attributes to prevent layout shifts
5. Optimize SVGs and icons
6. Implement font loading strategy with font-display: swap
7. Testing approach: Measure Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) before and after, verify Core Web Vitals pass, use WebPageTest to confirm image optimization

## 3. Implement Code Splitting and Lazy Loading [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Reduce initial bundle size through code splitting and implement lazy loading for non-critical components
### Details:
1. Analyze current bundle with tools like webpack-bundle-analyzer
2. Implement dynamic imports for route-based code splitting
3. Create lazy-loaded components with React.lazy() and Suspense
4. Set up route-based prefetching strategy
5. Prioritize critical CSS and defer non-critical styles
6. Testing approach: Measure First Input Delay (FID) and Time to Interactive (TTI), verify initial JS bundle < 170KB, ensure smooth user experience during navigation

## 4. Set Up Service Worker and Offline Functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.2
### Description: Implement service worker for offline access and caching of critical resources
### Details:
1. Configure next-pwa or workbox for service worker generation
2. Implement cache-first strategy for static assets
3. Set up network-first strategy for API requests
4. Create offline fallback pages
5. Implement background sync for offline actions
6. Add install prompt for Progressive Web App
7. Testing approach: Test offline functionality in Chrome DevTools, verify cached resources load when offline, measure performance improvements from cached assets

## 5. Optimize Search Index and Query Performance [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.3
### Description: Improve search functionality performance through index optimization and efficient query processing
### Details:
1. Analyze current search implementation and identify bottlenecks
2. Implement efficient indexing strategy (consider Algolia or Elasticsearch)
3. Optimize search queries with debouncing and throttling
4. Implement client-side caching for recent search results
5. Add search result prefetching for common queries
6. Optimize relevance scoring algorithm
7. Testing approach: Measure search response time before and after optimization, verify search results appear in < 200ms, test with large datasets

## 6. Reduce Bundle Size and Implement Caching Strategies [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4
### Description: Minimize JavaScript and CSS bundles while implementing effective caching strategies
### Details:
1. Audit and remove unused dependencies
2. Configure tree shaking and dead code elimination
3. Implement proper cache headers for all static assets
4. Set up CDN caching strategy
5. Minify and compress all JavaScript and CSS
6. Implement resource hints (preload, prefetch, preconnect)
7. Configure HTTP/2 server push for critical resources
8. Testing approach: Verify total bundle size < 500KB as specified in PRD, measure repeat visit performance, use Lighthouse to confirm effective caching
