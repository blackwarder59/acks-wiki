# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement Enhanced Hero Section with Visual Elements and User Journey Guidance
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Transform the current basic hero section into a visually stunning centerpiece with gradients, decorative elements, and clear user journey paths that guide both new and experienced users to appropriate content.
# Details:
Create a hero section that serves as the visual anchor for the site redesign with these specific elements:

1. **Background Design**:
   - Implement a subtle gradient background transitioning from primary to secondary brand colors
   - Add subtle animated decorative elements (e.g., floating shapes, particle effects) that don't distract from content
   - Ensure the background adapts appropriately to different screen sizes

2. **Content Structure**:
   - Create a compelling headline that clearly communicates the site's value proposition
   - Add a concise subheading that elaborates on the main benefits
   - Include a brief description that sets expectations for users

3. **User Journey Paths**:
   - Implement two distinct CTA buttons: one for new users ('Get Started') and one for experienced users ('Advanced Features')
   - Design visual indicators that subtly guide users to the appropriate path
   - Ensure each path has a clear visual hierarchy and destination

4. **Visual Elements**:
   - Add subtle micro-interactions on hover states for interactive elements
   - Implement a visual indicator showing the user's current position in the overall site journey
   - Include decorative elements that reinforce the brand identity

5. **Technical Requirements**:
   - Use CSS variables for consistent color application
   - Implement responsive design principles to ensure the hero section works on all devices
   - Optimize all animations for performance (use CSS transitions where possible)
   - Keep accessibility in mind with appropriate contrast ratios and semantic HTML

The hero section should load quickly and make an immediate visual impact while clearly guiding users to their next steps based on their experience level.

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify both the visual implementation and user journey functionality:

1. **Visual Testing**:
   - Verify the gradient background renders correctly across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
   - Confirm decorative elements appear and animate as expected without performance issues
   - Check that all visual elements maintain proper positioning across screen sizes (320px, 768px, 1024px, 1440px, and 1920px widths)
   - Validate that the design matches approved mockups with a visual comparison tool

2. **Functional Testing**:
   - Verify all CTA buttons are correctly linked to their destination pages
   - Test hover states and micro-interactions to ensure they trigger correctly
   - Confirm that tab navigation works logically through the hero section elements

3. **Performance Testing**:
   - Measure load time of the hero section (should be under 1.5 seconds on standard connections)
   - Use Chrome DevTools Performance panel to verify animations run at 60fps
   - Check memory usage to ensure decorative elements don't cause excessive resource consumption

4. **Accessibility Testing**:
   - Verify contrast ratios meet WCAG AA standards (minimum 4.5:1 for normal text)
   - Test with screen readers to ensure all content is properly announced
   - Verify keyboard navigation works correctly for all interactive elements

5. **User Testing**:
   - Conduct A/B testing comparing the new hero section against the current one
   - Track click-through rates on both user journey paths to verify they're being used as intended
   - Collect qualitative feedback on visual appeal and clarity of user journey options
