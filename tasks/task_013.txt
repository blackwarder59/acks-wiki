# Task ID: 13
# Title: Implement Design System Foundation with CSS Architecture
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7, 17, 18, 19
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a comprehensive CSS architecture that establishes the foundational styling framework for the homepage, including responsive layouts, animations, and consistent design tokens.
# Details:
Develop a modular CSS architecture using either SCSS or CSS-in-JS that includes:

1. Design Token System:
   - Create variables for colors, typography, spacing, shadows, and border-radius
   - Implement a consistent naming convention (e.g., --color-primary, --spacing-md)
   - Document all tokens in a style guide file

2. Layout Components:
   - Implement a responsive grid system with appropriate breakpoints (mobile, tablet, desktop)
   - Create flexible container components with consistent padding/margins
   - Develop utility classes for common layout patterns (e.g., flex containers, grids)

3. Visual Enhancement Utilities:
   - Build gradient generators with customizable directions and color stops
   - Create animation utilities for transitions, fades, and micro-interactions
   - Implement responsive image handling with appropriate sizing

4. Component Base Styles:
   - Establish base styles for typography, buttons, cards, and other UI elements
   - Ensure all components follow accessibility guidelines (contrast, focus states)
   - Create mixins or utility functions for commonly reused style patterns

5. Responsive Strategy:
   - Define standard breakpoints (e.g., 480px, 768px, 1024px, 1440px)
   - Implement a mobile-first approach with appropriate media queries
   - Create helper classes for responsive visibility and positioning

Ensure all styles are optimized for performance with appropriate CSS specificity and minimal redundancy.

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify both the technical implementation and visual consistency:

1. Code Quality Validation:
   - Run CSS linting tools to ensure code meets quality standards
   - Verify CSS architecture follows the defined naming conventions
   - Check for any unused styles or redundant declarations

2. Cross-Browser Testing:
   - Test in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge to ensure consistent rendering
   - Verify gradients and animations work properly across browsers
   - Confirm that polyfills are in place for any modern CSS features with limited support

3. Responsive Testing:
   - Test at all defined breakpoints using browser dev tools
   - Verify on actual devices (minimum: iPhone, Android, iPad, desktop)
   - Check that layouts adjust appropriately without horizontal scrolling or overflow issues

4. Performance Testing:
   - Measure CSS file size and loading performance
   - Check for render-blocking CSS issues
   - Verify efficient CSS selectors are used (avoid deep nesting)

5. Visual Regression Testing:
   - Create baseline screenshots of key components at different breakpoints
   - Compare against future changes to ensure visual consistency
   - Verify animations and transitions perform smoothly without jank

6. Accessibility Testing:
   - Verify color contrast meets WCAG AA standards
   - Check that focus states are clearly visible
   - Ensure text remains readable at all viewport sizes
