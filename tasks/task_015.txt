# Task ID: 15
# Title: Implement Monster Type Organization and Navigation Structure
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Restructure the Monster Manual section to organize monsters by ACKS II Monster Type and implement a hierarchical navigation system based on main chapters.
# Details:
This task involves implementing the reorganization plan outlined in MONSTER_MANUAL_REORG_PLAN.md with the following key components:

1. Create a top-level navigation structure that reflects the main chapters of the Monster Manual (Introduction, Monster Listings, Monster Creation, etc.)

2. Within the Monster Listings chapter, organize all monsters according to their official ACKS II Monster Type categories (Aberration, Animal, Beastman, Construct, etc.)

3. Implement a consistent page structure for each monster type category that includes:
   - A brief introduction to the monster type
   - A table/list of all monsters in that category with basic stats
   - Links to individual monster pages

4. Set up the directory structure to support this organization, likely using a pattern like `/monster-manual/monster-listings/[monster-type]/[monster-name].mdx`

5. Create navigation breadcrumbs to help users understand their location in the hierarchy

6. Ensure that special monster groups (Dragons, Elementals, Beastmen, Lycanthropes) have appropriate parent pages that explain the group before listing individual variants

7. Update any existing links or references to monster pages throughout the wiki to point to their new locations

8. Implement proper sorting of monsters within each type category (alphabetical by default unless otherwise specified)

The implementation should maintain all existing content while reorganizing it into the new structure.

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify both the structure and functionality of the reorganized Monster Manual:

1. Navigation Testing:
   - Verify that all top-level chapter links work correctly
   - Confirm breadcrumb navigation shows the correct hierarchy
   - Test that navigation between monster type categories works
   - Ensure links to individual monster pages function properly

2. Content Organization Testing:
   - Verify all monsters appear in their correct Monster Type category
   - Confirm special monster groups (Dragons, Elementals, etc.) have appropriate parent pages
   - Check that no monsters are missing from the reorganized structure
   - Verify that monster sorting within categories follows the expected order

3. URL Structure Testing:
   - Confirm URLs follow the planned structure
   - Test that old URLs redirect properly to new locations

4. Visual Inspection:
   - Review the navigation sidebar to ensure it correctly displays the hierarchy
   - Verify that monster type category pages have consistent formatting
   - Check that special monster groups are visually distinct

5. Cross-Browser Testing:
   - Verify the navigation structure works correctly across different browsers and devices

Document any issues found during testing with screenshots and specific URLs.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Directory Structure and Top-Level Navigation [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the foundational directory structure for the Monster Manual reorganization and implement the top-level navigation for main chapters.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create the base directory structure following the pattern `/monster-manual/[chapter]/[monster-type]/[monster-name].mdx`
2. Set up main chapter directories: Introduction, Monster Listings, Monster Creation, etc.
3. Create a top-level navigation component that displays these main chapters
4. Implement the navigation component in the Monster Manual layout
5. Create placeholder index pages for each main chapter
6. Set up the breadcrumb component that will display the hierarchical path
7. Test the navigation by ensuring all main chapter links work correctly

Testing approach:
- Verify that the directory structure is created correctly
- Ensure the top-level navigation displays all main chapters
- Check that breadcrumbs show the correct path
- Confirm that navigation between main chapters works as expected

## 2. Implement Monster Type Categories and Structure [done]
### Dependencies: 15.1
### Description: Create the monster type category pages and implement the structure for organizing monsters within each type.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create subdirectories for each ACKS II Monster Type (Aberration, Animal, Beastman, Construct, etc.) within the Monster Listings directory
2. Create index pages for each monster type with:
   - Brief introduction to the monster type
   - Template for a table/list of monsters in that category
   - Placeholder for basic stats display
3. Implement a consistent page structure template for each monster type category
4. Create a second-level navigation component for monster types
5. Update the breadcrumb component to include monster type categories
6. Set up special handling for complex monster groups (Dragons, Elementals, Beastmen, Lycanthropes)
   - Create parent pages for these groups
   - Implement subgroup navigation if needed

Testing approach:
- Verify all monster type categories have proper index pages
- Check that the navigation correctly displays all monster types
- Ensure special monster groups have appropriate parent pages
- Test breadcrumb navigation through the hierarchy

## 3. Migrate and Reorganize Existing Monster Content [done]
### Dependencies: 15.1, 15.2
### Description: Move existing monster content into the new structure and organize monsters according to their ACKS II Monster Type.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Identify all existing monster content in the wiki
2. Determine the correct ACKS II Monster Type for each monster
3. Create individual monster pages in the new directory structure
4. Migrate content from existing monster pages to the new pages
5. Implement alphabetical sorting of monsters within each type category
6. Ensure all monster metadata is preserved during migration
7. Create redirects from old URLs to new URLs to prevent broken links

Testing approach:
- Verify that all monsters have been migrated to the new structure
- Check that monsters appear in the correct type categories
- Ensure alphabetical sorting works correctly
- Test redirects from old URLs to confirm they point to the new locations

## 4. Implement Monster Listing Tables and Stats Display [done]
### Dependencies: 15.2, 15.3
### Description: Create tables/lists for each monster type category and implement the display of basic monster stats.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Design and implement a reusable table/list component for displaying monsters in a category
2. Create MDX components for displaying monster combat stats consistently
3. Update each monster type index page to include:
   - The table/list of all monsters in that category
   - Basic stats for each monster (HD, AC, movement, etc.)
   - Links to individual monster pages

5. Add filtering options if appropriate
6. Ensure tables are responsive and work on mobile devices

Testing approach:
- Verify that all monster type pages display their monsters correctly
- Check that basic stats are displayed accurately
- Test sorting functionality
- Ensure links to individual monster pages work
- Test responsive design on different screen sizes
