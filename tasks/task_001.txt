# Task ID: 1
# Title: Project Setup and Foundation
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up Next.js 14 project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS, including responsive layout, dark mode support, and basic routing structure.
# Details:
Initialize a Next.js 14 project with TypeScript support using `create-next-app`. Configure Tailwind CSS with custom theme variables for light/dark mode as specified in the PRD. Create the basic project structure following the file structure outlined in the PRD. Implement responsive layout components including header, sidebar, and main content area. Add dark mode toggle with system preference detection. Set up basic routing for content categories (monsters, spells, classes, equipment, domain rules, judge tools). Ensure mobile-first design with hamburger menu for smaller screens.

# Test Strategy:
Verify project builds without errors. Test responsive layout across multiple screen sizes (320px to 1440px). Confirm dark mode toggle works and persists user preference. Validate basic navigation between routes. Run Lighthouse audit to establish baseline performance metrics.
