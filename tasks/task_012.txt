# Task ID: 12
# Title: Implement Quick Stats and Features Dashboard
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7, 17, 18, 19
# Priority: medium
# Description: Design and develop an engaging dashboard that displays wiki statistics and provides interactive elements for quick access to key features and recently updated content.
# Details:
Create a dashboard component with the following sections:

1. Statistics Panel:
   - Total number of articles/pages
   - Number of contributors
   - Total edits/revisions
   - Content growth over time (with small chart)
   - Categories breakdown

2. Interactive Elements:
   - Recently Updated Content: Display 5-7 most recently edited pages with timestamps
   - Popular Searches: Show trending search terms based on user activity
   - Quick Access Buttons: Create shortcut buttons to key features (create page, advanced search, etc.)

3. Technical Implementation:
   - Use responsive design to ensure dashboard works on all device sizes
   - Implement data caching to minimize database load (refresh data every 30 minutes)
   - Add subtle animations for statistics counters and transitions
   - Ensure accessibility compliance with proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
   - Include toggle/collapse functionality to allow users to customize their view

4. Data Requirements:
   - Create necessary database queries to gather statistics efficiently
   - Implement analytics tracking to measure dashboard engagement
   - Set up proper error handling for when data cannot be retrieved

The dashboard should be visually appealing with consistent styling that matches the wiki's design system while providing genuine utility to returning users.

# Test Strategy:
Testing should include:

1. Functional Testing:
   - Verify all statistics display correct values from the database
   - Confirm recently updated content refreshes appropriately
   - Test all quick access buttons navigate to correct destinations
   - Validate that popular searches reflect actual user activity

2. Performance Testing:
   - Measure dashboard load time (should be under 1.5 seconds)
   - Verify caching mechanism works correctly
   - Test dashboard performance with large datasets

3. Responsive Design Testing:
   - Test on multiple screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
   - Verify all elements remain accessible and usable at all breakpoints

4. Accessibility Testing:
   - Run automated accessibility tests (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance)
   - Test keyboard navigation through all dashboard elements
   - Verify screen reader compatibility

5. User Testing:
   - Conduct A/B testing with a sample of users to measure engagement
   - Collect feedback on dashboard utility and visual appeal
   - Track analytics on which dashboard features receive the most interaction

6. Browser Compatibility:
   - Test across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
   - Verify consistent appearance and functionality
