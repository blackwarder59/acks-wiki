# Task ID: 11
# Title: Implement Enhanced Content Cards with Gradient Design and Interactive Elements
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Replace the current content grid with visually appealing, gradient-enhanced content cards that provide better visual hierarchy and improved call-to-action elements.
# Details:
Create a new component for enhanced content cards with the following specifications:

1. Visual Design:
   - Implement gradient backgrounds that transition smoothly between complementary colors
   - Add subtle drop shadows for depth perception (3-5px offset, 10-15% opacity)
   - Round corners consistently (8-10px radius)
   - Ensure proper padding within cards (16-24px)

2. Content Structure:
   - Title area with appropriate typography hierarchy
   - Brief description/excerpt area with truncation for consistency
   - Relevant iconography that matches content type (use from our design system)
   - Clear, visually distinct CTA button or link
   - Optional metadata display (date, author, category, etc.)

3. Interactive Elements:
   - Implement smooth hover effects that slightly elevate the card (transform: translateY(-3px))
   - Add transition for shadow depth on hover
   - Include subtle background color shift on hover
   - Ensure CTA elements have distinct hover states

4. Responsive Behavior:
   - Cards should reflow appropriately at all breakpoints
   - Maintain consistent spacing between cards (16px on mobile, 24px on desktop)
   - Adjust font sizes appropriately for different screen sizes

5. Accessibility:
   - Ensure sufficient color contrast between text and background
   - Maintain focus states for keyboard navigation
   - Add appropriate ARIA attributes
   - Test with screen readers

Use CSS Grid or Flexbox for the overall layout. Implement the component using our existing design system tokens for colors, spacing, and typography.

# Test Strategy:
1. Visual Testing:
   - Compare screenshots of new cards against design mockups using visual regression testing
   - Verify gradient rendering across different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
   - Confirm proper rendering at all standard breakpoints (320px, 768px, 1024px, 1440px)

2. Functional Testing:
   - Verify all hover effects work smoothly without performance issues
   - Test keyboard navigation through all card elements
   - Confirm that cards reflow correctly when browser is resized
   - Ensure all CTAs function correctly and lead to appropriate destinations

3. Accessibility Testing:
   - Run automated accessibility tests (Axe, WAVE) to verify WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
   - Test with screen readers (NVDA, VoiceOver) to ensure content is properly announced
   - Verify color contrast ratios meet minimum 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text
   - Test keyboard-only navigation through the card grid

4. Cross-browser Testing:
   - Test on latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
   - Verify on iOS Safari and Chrome for Android

5. Performance Testing:
   - Measure and compare render times before and after implementation
   - Check for layout shifts using Cumulative Layout Shift metrics
   - Verify that hover animations maintain 60fps
