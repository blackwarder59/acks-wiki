# Foreword

The ***Adventurer Conqueror King System***(***ACKS***)is a set of rules for role-playing in a world of swords, sorcery, and strongholds. As the name suggests, in ***ACKS*** players begin the game as adventurers in an imaginary land drawn from the epics and legends of the past. By conquering foes, gathering treasure, and accumulating land and followers, the adventurers accumulate the fame, wealth, and power they need to rise to greatness. If they are skilled and lucky, they can reign as kings, overlords, archmages, theocrats, merchant princes, and master thieves, holding the destiny of thousands in their hands.

The core rules for ***ACKS***were first published in 2012. A revised edition of the core rules, called the ***ACKS Imperial Imprint (ACKS II)***,was released in 2023. In the ***ACKS II Revised******Rulebook***,you will find all the rules for character creation, proficiencies, spells, equipment, dungeon delving, wilderness exploration, and combat necessary to run games of high adventure. But ***ACKS II***goes further — further than any other tabletop RPG on the market. ***ACKS II***offers rules for commerce, construction, criminal enterprises, domain and realm rulership, magic research, naval operations, and large-scale warfare with pitched battles, sieges, and more. Whatever you can imagine a fantasy RPG ruleset doing — ***ACKS***already does that.

It is the only game in the market that provides rules for everything from a skirmish between low-level fighters, to a diplomatic summit with a jealous senate, to a heist by a criminal syndicate, to a battle with 50,000 combatants. Because of its vast scope and mechanical depth, **ACKS II** is the ultimate tabletop role-playing game for players interested in long-term fantasy sandbox campaigns.

But running a long-term fantasy sandbox campaign isn’t easy. That’s where this book comes in.

Within these pages, you'll find the advice, inspiration, rules, and tools you need to create and run a legendary fantasy campaign that will be remembered for decades. Whether your players end up going on dangerous adventures in forgotten ruins, exploring the wilds beyond civilized ken, sailing the high seas as merchants or pirates, creating and running thieves’ guilds, or building mighty empires by sword and flame, the **ACKS Judges Journal** will be your indispensable guide.

## How To Use This Book

The **Adventurer Conqueror King System Judges Journal** (**ACKS JJ**) incorporates material from our original **ACKS Core Rules**, **ACKS Player’s Companion**, **ACKS Lairs & Encounters**, **ACKS Heroic Fantasy Handbook**, **Axioms** magazine, and the book **Arbiter of Worlds**, as well as all-new material created for this new volume.

However, the ***ACKS Judges Journal*** is not a complete ruleset. It was designed for use in conjunction with the ***ACKS Imperial Imprint***and ***ACKS Monstrous Manual***. If you are an experienced gamemaster, you might be able to use much of the material in the ***ACKS Judges Journal***in conjunction with another D20-based fantasy game rules set and/or bestiary. However, no other game can match ***ACKS***for comprehensive sandbox play, so you will not be able to take advantage of all the mechanics herein unless you are playing ***ACKS***.

This book is divided into six parts, each with a number of chapters.

Part I, **Praxis**, introduces the art and science of gamemastering a fantasy sandbox campaign, and then presents the behind-the-scenes rules you need to be an ***ACKS***judge, including random encounters, campaign activities, treasure, magic items, and more.

Part II, **Construction**, gives you a step-by-step methodology for creating fantasy campaign settings. You’ll learn how to use the “top-down zoom-in” methodology to get your sandbox ready for play.

Part III, **Abstraction**, includes a number of optional game systems to abstractly handle ***ACKS***gameplay. When your players send out their henchmen to go on adventures or clear territory for their domains, these rules will let you quickly resolve things.

Part IV, **Customization***,* offers mechanics for creating custom classes, races, magic types, and spells. These chapters “open the hood” to the ***ACKS***game engine and let you tinker and tweak it to fit your campaign setting.

Part V, **Appendices**,provides supplemental information of use to judges.

Now grab your dice, gather your friends, and let the adventure begin!

# PART I: PRAXIS

# Chapter 1: Foundations

*"Quis custodiet ipsos custodies?" - Juvenal, Roman poet, 2nd c. AD*

The great Juvenal asked: "Who watches the watchmen?" We ask: Who teaches the gamemasters how to gamemaster? Generally, the answer is "nobody." And that's a problem. We've long believed that one of the major obstacles impeding the spread of the tabletop hobby is the lack of good gamemasters (GMs). It's been our experience that most people who like games, given the chance, will participate in a tabletop RPG, and once they start participating, continue to enjoy it. But most people don't get to ever even try an RPG, simply because there is a worldwide shortage of gamemasters.

Thus, in Chapter 1 of the **Judges Journal**, we aim to lay the foundations you’ll need to serve as the gamemaster of an **ACKS** campaign. If you’re new to tabletop role-playing games, this part of the **Judges Journal** will be invaluable to you. It draws on four decades of experience running RPGs with lessons learned over thousands of sessions and condenses it down into digestible advice.

If you’re already an experienced gamemaster, you might be tempted to skip this part of the book. We hope you don’t! There are many styles of gamemastering, and if you’ve been doing this for decades, you doubtless have your own that works for you. However, not every style of gamemastery works well with every tabletop RPG. The advice and approach in the following chapters is specifically designed for running **ACKS**. You might agree with what you read, or you might disagree and do it another way. But you will at least have gained insight into why certain game design decisions were made and how we intended the game to be run, which will help you make the game your own.

## What’s In a Name?

A GM has many responsibilities. Among these are to help explain, teach, and enforce the rules; to rule on "grey areas" not covered by the rules; to control the flow of information between the world and the players; to play the adversaries which confront the adventurers during play; and to choose or create the setting and adventures for play. The manifold role of the GM is precisely what makes it so intimidating for new entrants — there are few people who feel comfortable organizing what is in essence a social club, and doing improvisational acting, and being a rules lawyer, and being a story writer, and so on.

The many roles of the GM have also contributed to the manifold names for the same job. One increasingly common name for a GM is "Storyteller," a legacy of White Wolf's ***Storyteller*** RPG system. However, we believe White Wolf did the craft of gamemastering an incalculable harm when it said that a person running one of their popular games was called a "Storyteller." It's a name that suggests that your primary role will be telling a story, and this mantra created an entire generation of gamers who viewed their chief job as playwright and stage director. The result: at best, melodramatic amateur theatre. At worst, entire groups turned off by a not-game with no rules. This situation has been worsened by the rise of shows like ***Critical Role****,* which are enjoyed as stories by their fans, and which create an expectation of a narrative experience rather than an interactive one.

Storytelling is indeed a function of the gamemaster, and it’s the one many people think they are signing up to fill. But it's actually just one of several functions, and – in ***ACKS***at least – it is the least important. So if not storytelling, what lies at the essence of being an ***ACKS*** gamemaster?

To answer that, we have to look to history. ***ACKS***descends from the original ***Dungeons & Dragons***role-playing game, and the original ***Dungeons & Dragons***descended from the ***Chainmail***miniature wargame. It would not be an exaggeration to say that all role-playing games descended from miniature wargaming. If you’ve never played any, miniature wargames are competitive simulations, generally with two opposed teams — say, Germany and Russia in World War II. But most miniature wargames also have a participant called a "judge" or "referee." The role of the judge in a miniature wargame is:

* To choose or create the scenario the other players will compete within.
* To help explain, teach, and enforce the rules.
* To prevent cheating and keep the players honest.
* To rule on “grey areas” not covered by the rules.
* To control the flow of information to permit “fog of war.”

Note what's absent from the role of a miniature wargame judge: There’s no conception of the wargame judge as a storyteller. A story might emerge over the course of a miniature wargame, but it does so by happenstance, as a result of the unfolding of the battle. When the game is over, a story — or, really, a fictional "military history" — could be written up. But the judge did not write it up in advance, or adjust the course of the game to have one side win or lose based on the plot.

Likewise, in early tabletop RPGs, the judges did not have a "story" for their game. They had a setting and a set of rules, and the outcome was left up to the players. The original RPG, ***Braunstein****,* which preceded D&D by several years, was explicitly an open-ended wargame, and ended up going in directions its creator never foresaw. (For more on the origins of D&D, see the authoritative book ***Playing at the World*** by Jon Peterson.)

Nor was the miniature wargame judge responsible for playing the adversary — he was, in fact, a neutral referee between the adversaries (i.e., the players). And so it was in the first role playing games; the GM was not responsible for playing the adversaries, either. In Dave Arneson's ***Blackmoor*** campaign, for instance, the players were initially pitted against each other — one of them was a vampire named Sir Fang, while another was a crusader — with Arneson serving as the arbiter. (In recent years, there’s been a resurgence of this play style, under the label “patron play,” with ***ACKS***being one of the systems most commonly used in such games.)

The foundation and first function of the GM was then, and is now, that of a judge. And for this reason, gamemasters in ***ACKS***are called Judges. At Autarch, we believe that every campaign is a law unto itself, and as Judge, your first job is jurisprudence. Going forward, we might use the word “gamemaster” to refer to general aspects of tabletop play — but when we say Judge we are referring specifically to your new role as the gamemaster of an ***ACKS***campaign.

## It's Not Your Job to Make Sure People Have Fun

If you spend much time reading or watching GM advice online, you’ll often be told that "the real job of the GM is to make sure people have fun."

But this is terrible advice. As an ***ACKS***Judge, it’s not your job to make sure everyone has fun. The belief that when a player doesn't have fun it means the GM has failed has caused more GMs more grief and heartburn than any other myth in gaming. You can be an amazing GM, yet a player might not have fun. Because whether or not people have fun is going to depend on factors that are outside your control: How did their spouse treat them on their way over? How was their day at work? How well do they roll the dice? Do they play the game as well as the other players? You can't control these things, and therefore you shouldn't feel responsible for them.

What you should feel responsible for doing is creating anenvironment in which everyone could have fun. Imagine that you are hosting a party: Your job is to provide the right mix of appetizers, drinks, ambiance, and crowd so that people can have fun. It's not to act like a clown because Rob had a bad day at work. This is a subtle point, but if you keep it in mind, you'll avoid a lot of self-inflicted doubt and stress about your role.

## The Agency Theory of Fun

So how do you create an environment in which everyone could have fun? In ***ACKS****,* it involves a concept we call “**the agency theory of fun**.”

In philosophy, agency is the capacity for human beings to make choices and to impose those choices on the world. Agency is an important psychological need. Yet in our everyday lives, humans in modern society feel an absence of agency. Most of our capacity for meaningful choice is illusory; our daily lives are routine, and our scope of choice limited by lack of opportunity or resources. Very few people can really “change the world” in even a small way. Almost all of us lock on to meaningless decisions, such as what football team to support, or what color to dye our hair, as a means of expressing our need for agency. When those decisions don’t bring us any sense of agency, we grow ever more frustrated.

At Autarch, we believe the great enjoyment elicited by tabletop RPGs is a result of creating a sense of agency among their players. In an RPG, by making choice X, the player can impose result Y, which is the essence of agency. And because tabletop RPGs are an experience shared within a meaningful social circle of friends and colleagues, result Y feels meaningful. In a sense, in the context of your circle of friends, Nick really did save Erik's life last week.

Moreover, because tabletop RPGs are enjoyed sequentially, in a campaign format, the number of choices made and the impact of those choices compounds over time. The game becomes more meaningful the longer it is experienced. This is why long-term campaigns are more fun than one-off sessions, and why playing with a bunch of close friends is more fun than playing solitaire or with a group of strangers. Sustained campaigns with close friends create a stronger sense of agency.

However, in order for a campaign to effectively create a sense of agency, the players must be able to make real (not faux) choices that have meaningful consequences on the players and their world. And that's a requirement which is in direct opposition to storytelling, or making sure everyone has fun.

### **The Paradox of Gamemastering**

Imagine that your party has only a few minutes to find the artifact that can close the gate to the abyss. The artifact could be underneath the dark citadel, or on the peak of the lonely mountain — but they don't have time to search both. Now, if your players have real choice, the artifact is really in one location or the other, and their choice will determine whether or not they find it. On the other hand, if they have faux choice, then they only think they have choice. Whichever choice they make, that will be where the artifact is, along with an interesting, pre-scripted encounter of their level forcing them to fight to get it. So in the latter instance either choice is ‘fun” — but both are faux.

Many GMs never offer real choice, because the problem with real choice is that players can only be sure they have real choice when they suffer meaningfully bad consequences. And in the context of a tabletop RPG, that usually means permanent destruction of something unique - a favored henchmen, irreplaceable magic artifact, animal companion, or player character.

For a while, a skilled sleight-of-hand artist can maintain suspension of disbelief about the reality of choice, leading players on a roller coaster ride that makes them think they are making real choices and facing meaningful consequences. It's the same art that a skilled novelist can use to make us believe that a favorite character is in danger, even though he's not. But a never-ending string of perfect, dramatically appropriate, fun outcomes that defies probability eventually leads even the dimmest players to realize they don't have real choice at all. A roller coaster may be a wild ride, but it's still a railroad. And when the railroading gets revealed, the sense of agency dies, and with it dies the unique value of the tabletop RPG.

So this, then, is the paradox of gamemastering: In order to make sure that everybody could have fun, you have to be willing to let the players make choices that lead to results that aren't fun. You can't guarantee the fun. And if you try to make sure everyone has fun, eventually you'll guarantee that no one has fun at all, because you'll destroy the sense of agency which is the root of the hobby's pleasure.

### Why Rules Matter

***ACKS***is first and foremost designed as a game that creates, empowers, and leverages player agency in the world. In fact, the agency theory of fun is precisely why ***ACKS***offers rules for every aspect of the game world.

Rules, in a tabletop RPG, are ultimately about what philosophers call action, where "action" means intentional effects caused by an agent. It is the rules that dictate the results of action, and thus define the relationship between a player's choices and the consequence he experiences. The rules provide the framework of cause and effect that gives meaning to choice. For instance, virtually every RPG has rules that dictate when you may choose to attack a target, how the success or failure of this attack is determined, and the consequences of each.

A game without rules cannot provide a sense of agency, any more than a world without causality can. If the players operate subject to arbitrary outcomes — what the ancients called “Acts of God” and RPG designers call “GM Fiat” — they have no meaningful way of knowing or understanding what the consequences of their choices will be, and thus no agency.

We believe that the agency theory of fun is the reason that esoteric games like ***Amber Diceless Roleplaying*** or ***Everway*** have never caught on, and why as games evolve, they tend to evolve in the direction of more rules. Comprehensible, detailed rules add to the players’ sense of agency, just as playing with friends in an ongoing campaign does.

Agency also explains why dice are, and will always be, a popular mechanic with RPGs. As we explained above with the example of the hidden artifact, if the consequences are pre-determined, then the choice is not real. The inherent contradiction between omniscience and free will has plagued religion for thousands of years, and it plagues RPGs, too. For instance, imagine if tabletop RPG combat went like this:

Player: “I attack the dragon.”

Judge: “Based on your attack bonus and the dragon’s armor class, if you attack, you are certain to miss.”

Player: “Uh... well I don't attack, then.”

It's hard to imagine that game being much fun because the result of the player's choices is determined before he's made them. (This is the same reason that Tic-Tac-Toe isn't fun.) Agency, then, requires that we be able to predict the consequences of our choices, but not with certainty.

***ACKS*** creates agency with its core mechanic, the throw: “A throw occurs whenever a character or monster is taking an action that will succeed or fail. To make a throw of the dice, you follow these steps: Throw the appropriate die for the action chosen; add any relevant modifiers to the number generated by the die; compare the total to a target value for the action, usually expressed as #+ (such as 12+).” The relevant modifiers and the target number provide causality. The die roll provides uncertainty. Both are essential.

## Judging the Game

For those of you who (wisely) avoided going to law school, we need to offer a quick introduction to some concepts of jurisprudence. First off, a **precedent** is a legal ruling on a particular issue that judges use to decide subsequent questions of law with similar issues. For instance, if a judge is asked to decide whether a semiautomatic pistol is a legitimate weapon of self-defense, a previous ruling that revolvers were legitimate weapons of self-defense would be precedent. If the precedent is followed, it is called "binding." If the precedent is ignored, the new case is said to be "distinguished" from the old by certain new facts. For instance, the court might distinguish pistols from revolvers by pointing out that their ammunition capacity is much greater.

The importance of precedent depends on whether the legal system is “common” or “civil.” The “common law” tradition originated in Old England as a history of legal rules created by judges when deciding disputes. The judges began with the traditional customs of how matters had been handled, and then over time built up a body of law based on those past precedents. Common law generally has little or no basis in anything written, except perhaps a foundational Constitution or some scattered medieval statutes. The main advantage of the common law is its deep roots in the traditions of the people and its adaptability to areas of uncertainty. The main disadvantage of the common law is that there is no written "code" that citizens can consult to understand the laws of the land.

On the other hand, the “civil law” originated in the Roman Empire as a collection or code of statutes created by legislatures. Judges interpreted the statutes, but their rulings were not said to create law. The main advantage of a civil law system is that its citizens can easily consult the statutes to understand the laws, most of which have been created by their democratically-selected legislators. The main disadvantage of a civil law system is that citizens can't depend on different judges to interpret the law the same way each time there's a case.

Faced with a question, a purely common-law judge will look up what prior judges said when they were confronted by similar questions. Meanwhile, a purely civil law judge will look up what the most relevant statute says about the question and interpret it as he thinks best. Since each system has weaknesses, most legal systems today use a mix of both civil and common law, with legislators creating the overall framework of statutes, while judges fill in the gaps using common law methods based on precedent. Under this system, citizens can look at statutes to learn the baseline of the law, and then refer to past cases to understand how judges have previously ruled.

What does this have to do with ***ACKS***?In the intro to the Foundationssection, we noted that the foundational role of an ***ACKS*** gamemaster was that of Judge. To extend the analogy, the game designer of ***ACKS*** is analogous to the legislature; the game rules of ***ACKS***are the civil law; the citizens are the players; and the decisions of the Judge about grey areas in the rules are the common law. The process of the Judge ruling on grey areas creates precedent.

### **Today’s Rulings are Tomorrow’s Rules**

If you don’t follow your own precedents, then your players cannot reliably understand the game world they act within. That, in turn, deprives them of the ability to make informed choices, which is necessary for player agency.

To prove this point, let's illustrate what happens when precedent is ignored. Imagine that you are running an ACKS campaign. During a desperate retreat, Marcus, the party's fighter, needs to jump backwards from a standing start across a 4’ chasm to safety. Now, ***ACKS***does have rule for Jumping and Leaping:

The maximum distance in feet that an adventurer can jump horizontally is equal to his DEX score + 1d6. The height and distance jumped are reduced by 1’ per stone of encumbrance the adventurer is carrying. An adventurer must have a moving start of at least 20’ or his leaping height and jumping distance, after encumbrance, are halved. (***ACKS II***, p. XX)

Unfortunately, the rules as written assume that the adventurer is jumping forwards and say nothing about jumping backwards. If jumping forward from a standing start halves jump distance, what sort of penalty should apply to jumping backwards from a standing start? This is up to you, the Judge!

Let’s assume you decide that jumping backwards from a standard start is similar to jumping forward from a standing start, except that it reduces the character’s jumping distance to one-third his base instead of one-half. Marcus has a DEX score of 14 and 6 stones of encumbrance. Therefore Marcus’s player will roll (1d6 + 14 – 6) / 3 to determine his jump distance. Marcus rolls a 4, so he jumps (18 – 6) / 3 = 4 feet. That’s enough to cross the chasm!

Next round, Viktir, the party thief, also needs to jump backwards across the chasm from a standing start. Because you are a Judge who ignores precedent, you ignore your own ruling in the prior round. Instead, you again consult the ***ACKS II***rulebook and again note that jumping backwards from a standing start is not covered by the rules. This time, you decide that jumping backwards must require great strength as well as dexterity, and you rule that the character’s jumping distance is one-half the lower of STR or DEX. Viktir, with a DEX of 18 and a STR of 7, fails to make the jump, and plummets to his death. His player angrily demands to know why Marcus got to use one-third of his DEX while Viktir had to use one-half of his STR for the same task. After all, his character would be alive if you had stuck to precedent!

What can you say to this criticism? You could say that you're the Judge; that your word is law; and that it's your right to rule however you like on situations not covered by the rules. You could say that there is no written rule stating which attribute is to be used in resolving the success of backwards jumps, so this is completely fair. But none of these responses is likely to persuade the player of poor dead Viktir that you are a fair judge — because you aren’t.

Let’s now imagine that a couple weeks have passed, and the party’s most powerful hero, Morne, must now, jump backwards across this same chasm. Morne has both 18 DEX and 18 STR with no stones of encumbrance, so he feels confident he’ll succeed no matter how your rule. Well, you once again check the rules and again see no game mechanic covering this situation. Therefore, you announce that Morne has a flat 2 in 6 chance of falling in, but otherwise he jumps across successfully. Morne’s player furiously demands to know why he now has a 33% chance of falling in, when he’d have automatically succeeded if you stuck with either of your two past rulings. Do you shrug and say “there's no rule that says it has to be based on your attributes?

Of course not. It should be obvious that this is not a healthy manner in which to run a game. A Judge who runs his game without respecting precedent is a Judge running a game that lacks fairness, common sense, and verisimilitude. Yet it's very common when playing RPGs to experience this sort of arbitrary decision-making on the part of the gamemaster out of an insistence that “the first rule of the game is that the GM is always right!” This attitude derives from a failure to recognize that, just like a common law judge creates law when he decides a case, a gamemaster creates rules when he makes rulings*.*

Being a great ***ACKS***Judge entails applying the same rules to the same situation fairly for each player over the course of the campaign. The so-called “rules vs rulings” distinction is a false distinction. Rulings are rules and once put in place need to be treated as such.

### **The Canons of Statutory Interpretation in *ACKS***

Is there a reliable method for issuing fair rulings about vague areas in the rules? This a problem that has confounded real-world courts and judges for centuries. The best answer they’ve come up with is to follow the “**canons of statutory interpretation**,” which are a series of heuristics that help determine the meaning of laws. A thorough discussion of the canons takes about fifty pages, but fortunately judging an ***ACKS***game is considerably easier than judging a class action lawsuit. Below we offer the set of canons of statutory interpretation by which you can and should interpret the game rules of ***ACKS****.*

1. Your starting point in interpreting rules is always the plain language employed by the game designer.
2. If a rule specifically defines a term, use the defined definition; but in the absence of a defined definition, interpret the rule in accordance with the ordinary and natural meaning of the language (the dictionary definition).
3. If the rule is still ambiguous, look at the rule holistically. Terminology in a rule that is ambiguous in isolation may be clarified if the same terminology is used elsewhere in a context that makes its meaning clear, or because only one of the possible meanings is compatible with the rest of the game.
4. Judges should not interpret different terms within the same rule to mean the same thing, nor the same term within the same rule to mean different things.
5. If the literal interpretation of the words is absurd, the rule must be interpreted to avoid absurdity.
6. If possible, give meaning to every clause and word of a rule; don't assume anything is redundant.
7. Specific rules override general rules.

By applying these canons, you can resolve 99% of your rulings in a fair and reasonable manner. Your outcomes won’t necessarily be the same outcome that we’d come up with in the same circumstance, but that’s fine — your players will quickly learn how you interpret the rules, and feel good knowing that the game has a fair referee running things.

## Letting the Story Emerge

The agency theory of fun we introduced earlier asserts that by focusing on objective rules, honest dice, and player choice, you maximize the fun for your players in the long term. This theory is almost entirely incompatible with the narrativist school of gamemastering that has dominated in the past two decades, which teaches that telling a story is the most important function of the GM, with a particular emphasis on the need to create a “story arc” for the players to follow.

Stories, of course, are as old as mankind, but not every story is part of a story arc. Consider the early Greek myths of Perseus slaying the Medusa, and of Bellerophon slaying the Chimera. Each has a story “line,” but there is no link between the two. In contrast, consider the later myths of Paris wooing Helen of Troy, Achilles slaying Hector, and Odysseus encountering Circe — these are all linked by the "Trojan War" story arc. For a more recent example, contrast the adventures of Robert Howard’s Conan (short stories enjoyable in any order without a story arc) with Tolkien's Bilbo and Frodo (adventures within a larger story arc).

Many people's earliest experiences of role-playing games are similar to those early Greek myths or Conan short stories. The party of adventurers goes to the dungeon, knocks down some doors, kills some orcs, and goes home. Next week’s adventure, they knock down some thicker doors, kill some ogres, and so on. The first published RPG products that actually linked adventures across space and time was Gary Gygax's G-D-Q series of modules (***Against the Giants*** leading to ***Vault of the Drow*** culminating in ***Queen of the Demonweb Pits***). But the big breakthrough came when TSR gave us the ***Dragonlance***series, which featured a story arc over a dozen modules long.

To players in the mid ‘80s, story arcs were revolutionary, adding highly detailed backgrounds, flavorful depth, and a sense of purpose to what had previously been only loosely connected modules. And those are all wonderful things, things that any good ***ACKS***Judge should strive to have in his games. But there was a hidden cost to the story arc: a cost in player agency. A story arc only works if the narrator can create a plot — that is: a sequence of events that effects change on the situation of his protagonists. If the narrator is a gamemaster, then the players are his protagonists, and he's made a commitment to effecting change on them. The players are now the objects, rather than subjects, of a story. A story arc transforms adventurers and agents into actors and audience.

For this reason, we call campaigns that use a story arc “**directed stories**.” The gamemaster, like a stage or movie director, is directing the sequence of events that will occur with an eye towards achieving particular outcomes or expressing particular themes. It is story focused on what happens next. The opposite of directed story is “**emergent story**,” story focused on what just happened. Emergent story is the memoirs of your fictional characters, and the history of their fictional deeds.

A directed story GM is concerned with whether or not what the players are doing is moving things in the direction the gamemaster desires. An emergent story GM is concerned with whether or not the players are succeeding in moving things in the direction the players desire.

***ACKS***is intended to be a game of emergent stories, not directed stories.

### A Web, Not an Arc

Emergent story does not happen in a vacuum. You cannot simply release your players into the Auran Empire and expect entertainment to ensue — or if entertainment does ensue, it will likely be very short term and involve inns, bar brawls, or orcs. Emergent story needs its own version of the story arc, but one catered to emergent play. The technique we recommend to enable emergent storytelling is something we call a “**story web**.”

The story web approach is location based, rather than event based. It begins with a map of the region within which the campaign will launch (often called the “**sandbox**”), and developing a few dozen “**points of interest**” within it. Points of interest are simply locations in your game world that will be interesting to adventurers. Different Judges use different methods to create their points of interest. You could use a mix of free-form creativity, adaptation/borrowing of other published material, rolls on random encounter charts, or other techniques. A good point of interest is not more than a paragraph or two in length. Here’s an example of a point of interest from Autarch’s official campaign setting, the Borderlands of the Auran Empire:

**21. Shrine of the White Lady:** Hidden in a secluded forest clearing is an ivy-covered shrine of white marble, sacred to Demara, the White Lady, built by the elves when they ruled Southern Argollë. The shrine is guarded by a **unicorn** (20 hp) who protects it from the monsters of the Viaspen Forest. Within the shrine is a pool of crystal-clear water. The waters of the pool carry a fey magic. Any Lawful character who drinks from it is relieved of one side effect from **tampering with mortality**; in exchange for this boon, the character receives a *quest* to destroy Chaotic creatures in Southern Argollë. The pool’s waters work but once in a character’s lifetime. The ceiling of the shrine carries a mosaic map of the Borderlands as it stood before the Argollëan War and shows the locations of Cyfaraun (#10), the Collapsed Elven Keep (#16), the Ruined City of Cyfandir (#25), and the Watchtower at Eammon Mór (45).

Once you’ve come up with some points of interest, you go back and look for possible links between them — proximity, shared history, etc. The idea is that since story is going to emerge from the characters encountering interesting stuff, the story web should help them move from one point of interest to another. The Shrine of the White Lady, for instance, has a ceiling mosaic that shows the path to four other points of interest that were all historically linked to the fallen elven kingdom.

But having a mosaic in a point of interest is just one way of linking up the story web. Other ways players could uncover links between locations in your sandbox include finding treasure maps in hoards that lead to another point of interest; rescuing captives that hail from another place; translating hieroglyphic carvings on the wall that mention another point of interest; reading NPC journals about other locations; talking to NPCs who traveled between the two locations; and so on.

What contrasts the story web from the story arc is that it offers two different layers of choice. The first layer of choice is that at any point the party has multiple threads of the web to pursue. Do they want to see where the treasure map leads, or visit the elven ruins they learned about from the mosaic? The second layer of choice is the ability for the party to ignore the web entirely. Since the points of interest exist independently as locations in the game world, the party can go explore as it would like. In short, the story web is a road network to a range of destinations, not a railroad track leading down one way.

With a story web, you can't be sure that your players will encounter #1 before #2, or #2 before #10. Nor can you be sure they'll encounter any particular location, character, or monster at all. You have established a setting, but the story that occurs within that setting will be the result of player choice. They will be enjoying an emergent story as they move along the strands of your story web. (Or they may enjoy burning your story web to the ground, as the case may be.)

At a certain point in the course of running your campaign, you might begin to feel the urge to transform the emergent story into a directed story. You might find yourself saying, "The Lost Temple of Arneson is so cool! I really want them to go there." And so the local King will come down with Bubonic Ebola, which will only be cured if the Polyhedral of Power can be recovered from the Lost Temple. Now, there's nothing wrong with this per se; later in this book we offer a set of random charts to create background events in your setting, and one of them really can inflict pestilence on the population.

But to stay true to player agency, you need to be willing to let your players say, "Nah. I'd rather go check out the Tower of Gygax. Pass the King our best wishes for his recovery." You need to run with what the players want to do. Maybe that means the King dies, and the land is in upheaval. Maybe it means that another adventurer recovers the Polyhedral, and the PCs suddenly have rivals for their fame in the land. Maybe it means that the King declares them outlaws, and they join forces with the monsters. Again, the point is that the story isn't something you decide alone. The story emerges from what the players decide.

Don’t let yourself get too disconcerted about the challenges of emergent storytelling. ***ACKS***is built from the ground-up to make it happen, and in subsequent chapters we’ll give you all the tools you need to create an amazing sandbox. This section is just providing you with the philosophical framework to understand what comes later.

## Adversarial Action

Let’s set aside talk of rules and story now to discuss your role as the adversary.

### The Judge is God - But He Plays Satan

Every ***ACKS***Judge is God — or, at least, he is god of the world he has created. With pen and mouse, he can raise and lower mountain ranges, bring ruin to great civilizations, change the climate, unleash catastrophes. Within the context of an ***ACKS***campaign, the Judge has powers worthy of the Old Testament. But that god-like omnipotence must sometimes be set aside, so that the Judge can adopt another Biblical role.

In Hebrew, the [word for adversary](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adversary) is "satan," and throughout the Hebrew tradition, the various military and legal adversaries of the characters are always called the Satan. The role of the Satan in this tradition is always to test the protagonists to his fullest extent, even though God, who created Satan in the first place and assigned him to this task, is secretly hoping the protagonists will succeed in overcoming these tests. Most famously, the Satan appears in the Book of Job as an agent of God, whose role is to test the faith of the hapless hero. The Satan afflicts Job with loss of family, property, and health in order to tempt him to evil, but Job only gains character in the face of this adversity.

The Book of Job is wonderfully illustrative of the relationship between your job as a whole and your specific role as adversary. As god of the world you have created, you will create various agents and use them as adversaries to test your players with various challenges. Playing as the adversary, you will test the protagonist to their fullest extent, and sometimes (playing as the adversary) defeat them, even though you (being god of the game world) are always secretly hoping the protagonists will succeed in overcoming these tests.

### Don't Make the Adversary into a God

Now that we've given you a framework of Biblical proportions, the first thing you're going to need to do is create some adversaries to play. And here's where you are most likely to make your first big mistake: You'll make your adversary too godlike, too powerful. God didn't give Satan the power to just arbitrarily kill Job, but all too often, GMs give their main adversaries the power to arbitrarily kill the whole party. The rules of many games contribute to this.

Consider Sauron, the classic dark lord of fantasy fiction, and compare him to a 20th level Wizard in, for instance, ***D&D 3.5E****.* In order to learn the name of the thief (a 1st level halfling burglar) who had his One Ring, Sauron was forced to torture it out of Gollum. He then had to have minions ride on horseback to the local village, to ask around for this fellow, and when they thought they had found him, they actually had to break into his inn and stab him with swords! In contrast, a 20th level Wizard in D&D could simply use ***Discern Location*** to find the ring, cast a quick ***Greater Teleport***to its location, and then just ***Power Word Kill*** Frodo and take the damn thing. In other words, Sauron, who was a demigod, is way, way less powerful than a standard ***D&D*** wizard of not even epic level. That's pretty problematic if you want to create a villain! Sauron is Satan, but a 20th-level D&D Wizard is God.

***ACKS****,* however, is designed to avoid such conundrums. We substantially reduced the range and utility of all detection and teleportation magic relative to other D20 games. High-level mages are still deadly — they can blast entire companies of troops and shatter structures — but there are simply no magical spy satellites that can find people, and no way for casters to safely beam across the continent to instantly destroy their foes. This allows you, as an ***ACKS***Judge, to have powerful villains that are still localized in their scope of threat.

In fact, much of the game design of ***ACKS***is intended to prevent powerful heroes and villains from transforming into super-heroes and super-villains. There would be little point to armies of troops if a single Superman could defeat them all; there would be little point to building strongholds if the average mage could annihilate them. As you tinker with the game to make it your own, keep these design goals in mind. If you add superheroic capabilities to your NPCs, you’ll be fundamentally changing the structure of the game.

If you really must have a god-like villain as part of your campaign concept, we recommend beginning your campaign with him somehow crippled at the outset. Over time his power increases, but so does that of the heroes. The early books of the ***Wheel of Time*** series did this beautifully, with a series of seals being broken, each break increasing the scope and power of the Dark One. Because of ***ACKS***’ leveling mechanic, this approach lets you build a story web where the danger from the villain scales up as the adventurers move through the web.

### The Parable of the King and Courtesan

There is a famous parable of a wise king who was concerned that his son lacked the moral character to rule. As a Biblical scholar, the king was familiar with the Book of Job, and he decided that he would test his son's character as God had tested Job's. So the king found the most beautiful courtesan in his harem, and commanded her to attempt to seduce his son. To make the test challenging, he made sure the courtesan was beautiful, and told her that if she seduced his son, she would be queen. So motivated, she used all her charms on the hapless prince, yet when she failed to seduce the prince, the king was delighted. The lesson for ***ACKS***Judges should be clear: While you might play the courtesan, you are the king. You don't really want to screw your players; you just want to test their characters.

### Personalizing the Adversaries

It seems an obvious point, but the best adversaries are people (loosely defined as "sapient creatures"). People generally find the challenges posed by other people to be the most interesting.

Of course, it's true that not every adversary needs to be a person. Dungeon traps are classic adversaries: They pose challenges that test the players' determination and cunning. Sometimes the environment itself is adversarial; natural disasters, wilderness obstacles, and catastrophic weather can all pose challenges to the players, but a campaign where the main villain is, for instance, an earthquake is likely to be an uninteresting campaign. Add an Elder Elemental Cult actively promoting the earthquake and fighting against the would-be heroes, and it gets more interesting again.

Still, even when the adversary is a person, it needn't be an enemy. An adversary just needs to be a character who poses challenges. The adversary could be a foil who serves to bring the protagonists into sharper focus. The adversary could be an ally who causes more trouble than they are worth, like Lois Lane for Superman. Or it could be a rival from the same side who makes the heroes stay on top of their game. The latter is an under-utilized, but highly effective, adversary.

In ***Capital of the Borderlands***, we provide Judges with an NPC adventuring party, “Imperial Vanguard,” that can wander the map and clear dungeons in regions near the PC adventurers. In the original Auran Empire campaign, the Imperial Vanguard was introduced by having the players arrive at a dungeon already cleared of monsters, with a bold flag planted bearing the I.V. standard outside the entrance. Because the two parties weren't enemies per se — indeed, I.V. was technically an ally to the cause — the players could not simply confront and destroy them. That made I.V. even more challenging as adversaries. Without any possibility for direct confrontation, Imperial Vanguard suddenly became a factor in the party's every decision: Where should we explore to make sure we get there first? How long can we afford to rest without Imperial Vanguard cleaning the dungeon out before us? And so on. For a long time, the monsters in our campaign were just the means to the players' end of beating Imperial Vanguard.

### Playing the Adversaries

Creating interesting adversaries is only half the challenge, of course. The other half is playing them. Playing RPG adversaries is harder than it seems. Throughout this book, we have argued against railroading players into happy endings, fudging dice to make sure the players feel good, like bringing nerf chainsaws to the Thunderdome. But it’s just as bad to go too far the other way. Especially when playing a tactically rich RPG like ***ACKS***, it's all too easy to treat encounters like wargames, with every adversary acting like a playing piece that's happy to sacrifice itself for the grand strategy. As we said earlier, RPGs have wargame roots, so it's only natural for you sometimes feel like you’re playing a wargame. This is when it’s wise to remember that the gamemaster’s wargame roots are as the neutral Judge, not as the Adversary. An ***ACKS***Judge who loses sight of this will inflict incalculable harm on a party he has totally outgunned.

For instance, he'll run opponents who'd rather fight to the last man than surrender, because the Judge wants to inflict a few more hit points of damage to weaken the party before the next encounter; he’ll run leaders who can never be surprised by the party’s tactics, because the Judge allows his villains to know everything he knows; he’ll use enemies who always attack as soon as the party splits up, because the Judge wants to teach the players “never to split the party”; and so on.

A Judge can always win if he wants to, and you don't prove anything by “beating” the players. But you do create an escalating level of antagonism between the Judge and the players. We’ve seen players ask their Judge to leave the room when they plan their strategy, for fear the Judge will cheat and use what he knows against them. We've seen players refuse to tell the Judge how many hit points their characters have left, so the Judge can’t have his minions target the weaker characters.

Conditions like these are symptomatic of a campaign in which the Judge has lost sight of his primary role as a Judge and gotten caught up in a secondary role (as Adversary).

The worst possible combination is an almost sadistic paternalism: The Judge, relishing the pleasure of beating the players, uses the full scope of his powers to create and run impossible challenges, only to then fudge the dice to let the players win; usually letting them know he fudged it so that they can advance through “his” storyline the way the Judge wants them to. This style of gamemastering was actually outlawed by the Geneva Convention as a form of torture, but the US and UK weren’t signatories to that chapter, and it continues to be practiced in some areas.

Our recommended method of running adversaries is to role-play them. When we run orcs, they attack how the Dark Ages barbarians of the north were alleged to fight: in loose waves, berserk, initially heedless of casualties. If forced back enough by stout defense, their morale collapses, and they become easy prey to be mopped up. On the other hand, when we run were-rats, they attack only if they can ambush, retreat at the first sign of trouble, and surrender to save their furry hides if need be. And when we play thousand-year old dragons, we plan carefully, move cautiously, and don't take any risks that could cost them their next thousand years.

Never give the enemies knowledge they shouldn't have. For instance, the Crusader in our Auran Empire campaign secretly wore a Scarab of Protection that made him immune to death magic. Nevertheless, an evil lich that encountered the Crusader used death magic on the Crusader, because he posed the seemingly greatest threat to the lich. The lich didn’t know that the Crusader was immune. (See our earlier notes on why your villains shouldn’t have God-like omniscience!)

Doing it this way sometimes means that the NPCs don't behave in ways that would be considered tactically correct by a wargamer who knows everything you know. Sometimes they'll surrender, even though if they'd have kept attacking, the monsters in the next room would have been able to defeat the party. Sometimes they'll run away, even though running away is just about the worst thing you can do in a battle (historically, 90% of all casualties were inflicted when the other side’s morale broke).

This approach means the players can try kooky plans that would never fool you — but might fool the hill giants. It creates a more naturalistic, “real” world. And it can even turn fights into subtle clues to the nature of the opposition. “How did the were-rats know we were coming?” is a far more satisfying query if the answer is “because Steve the Retainer is a were-rat spy,” rather than disassociated justification such as “this encounter will be more challenging if the player's ambush doesn't work.” The beauty of playing the adversaries this way is that it also frees your players to participate in the experience as role-players, rather than wargamers.

## Handling Combat

Perhaps the most perennial complaint that players make about tabletop RPGs is that combat is boring. One RPG player quipped that “a tabletop game is 15 minutes of fun packed into 4 hours.” Many players have described their game combats as “slogs” and complained about slow, dull resolution. Fortunately, as an ***ACKS***Judge, you can do better.

### **What’s in it for me?**

Combat encounters are, as a general rule, the most complex and time-consuming rules element of any RPG. (Certain extended scenes of role-playing may, of course, take longer than a fight, but this is not usually due to the rules.) When running lengthy and complex activities, unfortunately, it's easy to lose your players’ attention. Concentration is hard, and the lure of munchies, doodling, or — even worse — mobile phones is strong. Every player is continuously tuned into the radio station WINI FM, or “What's in it for me?” Players will pay sharp attention to facts and details that relate to their character, but they quickly tune out if they deem the information or action irrelevant to them. As a result, it's all too often the case that during a combat encounter, only the currently active player and the gamemaster are paying attention at any given moment, while the rest of the players are sitting there bored, merely waiting for their turn to have fun. Worse, they might be actively disrupting the game with side chat!

So, how can this be overcome? In ***ACKS****,* the answer is high stakes and vivid imagery — the violence and the viscera of a combat encounter.

### **The Stakes Must Be Real!**

As we explained earlier, RPGs must offer their participants real choices with meaningful consequences, not merely the illusion of challenge. This is doubly important in combat! And yet most game masters practicing today will openly admit that they pre-balance the encounters, fudge the dice, and change the rules to ensure the players win. Then they wonder why their players are bored...

Don’t imitate their practices. If you want your combat to be exciting, leave the outcome of the fight uncertain and make sure the stakes really matter. When you run combat, the stakes should always real. Beloved henchmen might be brutally slain. Favored magic items might be destroyed, never to be seen again. Heroic sacrifices might be in vain, and the entire party could get wiped out no matter how invested the players may be. (In my own Auran Empire campaign, nearly everyone was slain in a penultimate fight against the arch-villain in the 67th session, leaving the survivors thirsty for climactic revenge.)

In offering this advice, we fully acknowledge that we are being both reactionary and contrarian. Since the beginning of the so-called Hickman Revolution in 1984, most RPGs have gravitated towards removing all the actual risk from the game in the interest of allowing the players to experience an ongoing narrative with some certainty that they will see its finish. Loss and death are considered “not fun” and excluded from the gaming experience. The trend towards reducing the risk of permanent loss accelerated thereafter. By the time D&D reached its Fourth Edition, not only was it nearly impossible for a player character to die, but rust monsters didn’t even permanently destroy items anymore because it was “not fun” to lose gear.

At Autarch, we believe this trend, more than any other trend, explains why RPG combat is so often boring. If the players will always win, then why should they bother to pay attention or even care? Answer: They shouldn’t, and they won’t.

To be clear, we are not saying that every combat must put the entire party at risk of being slain. Making every encounter into a pitched battle with existential stakes is just as destructive to player agency as making every battle a victory: Players need to be able to make choices that can lead to easy wins, too.

No, what we are saying is that every combat should put the entire party at the risk of losing whatever should be at risk of loss in the game world. There are four broad levels of risk:

1. Strategic Position
2. Assets
3. Character
4. Party

When an encounter risks “strategic position,” it means that the circumstances under which the player characters are adventuring may change for the worse if the encounter is not handled smartly. For instance, if your mid-level adventurers encounter goblin scouts with war-horns, they will almost certainly win the encounter, but they risk winning it only after the scouts have sounded the alarm.

When an encounter risks “assets,” it means that survival of every player character is likely but the participants might lose things they value. This could be treasure, vehicles, pets, henchmen, magic items, and so on. An encounter with a rust monster is an asset risk encounter. If your players choose to take on a rust monster, the consequences of item loss need to be real.

When an encounter risks “characters,” it means that survival of the party as a whole is likely, but individual player characters might die or be irreparably harmed. An encounter with energy-draining undead could be a character risk encounter, as even a victorious party might experience real harm.

When an encounter risks “party,” it means that the survival of the party as a whole is in question. Losing this fight will mean that every character is killed and the campaign is over.

If you've been “trusting in the Fudge,” i.e. fudging your dice and outcomes, try putting something at stake in your next combat. It doesn't take much to get the players to sit up straight and get involved in the combat. The moment they realize they could lose something, they start to pay attention. And if they realize they could lose everything, the increase in intensity is palpable.

As a rule of thumb, you can tell whether you've run a great fight by how the players react to someone getting the killing blow on a monster. If they're bitter that they weren't the “cool kid” who got the kill, then there was no real risk — they were just competing narcissistically amongst themselves. If they are fist-bumping the player who got the killing blow and cheering with relief, then you ran a great fight.

### **The Spectacle Must Be Awesome!**

RPGs are always described as games of the imagination, in which the players and the gamemaster weave the action and imagery with their words. And yet, all too often, combat is just run by the numbers: “Bob, roll to hit.” “14! I hit it. I did 8 damage.
“ “OK, the orc dies. Jim, you're up next.” Such a fight can be intellectually stimulating, if you're a wargamer, and it can be worth paying attention to, if the stakes are real, but it is nevertheless lacking in emotional punch.

Given that everyone comes into RPGs wanting to use their imagination, the reasons why combat devolves to simple mechanics are somewhat mysterious to us. It might be because nothing is at stake. It's hard to conjure up the energy for vivid imagery when it doesn’t really matter. Whatever the reason, running a role-playing game by the numbers is a crime akin to serving chips without salsa: Violators should be taken out and shot. Violence demands viscera!

Now, some of you might be fortunate enough to have, through long practice, refined the art for conjuring up visceral violence nearly at will. “You swing your iron-flanged mace into the orc's chin, the force of the blow smashing so hard that its teeth shatter into sharp shards that embed themselves in its bloody cheeks. Then the orc's axe carves your belly open, and your intestines leak out like wet, pulpy worms*.*” For the less practiced, we've prepared a short list of rules of thumb to help you out.

**Brutal Blows:** Sometimes an attack in ***ACKS***leads to a particularly brutal result, with damage or consequences far in excess of the norm. A brutal blow could be a spear charge that rolls maximum damage, a dragon’s decapitating bite, a thief’s bloody backstab, or simply a great damage roll with a great axe. If you narrate nothing else, narrate these**.** Unless your players are particularly squeamish, go for horror-movie levels of gore, for body horror — the graphic destruction of the body. The most visceral reactions come from gruesome penetration of soft, pulpy body parts, or the shattering of bones that we all secretly fear breaking. Go for thrusts through the soft palate of the upper mouth or the loose skin of the neck; impacts on the fragile bones of the knee-cap or elbow; slashes through the tender skin of the belly. Carve off the breasts and leave them dangling, crack open the cranium and have grey jelly spray outward, shatter the spine and let spinal fluid leak onto the floor.

**Hits:** Every good hit deserves a good description. However, ***ACKS***, like most RPGs in the D20 tradition, gives powerful characters the ability to survive dozens of hits. If every successful attack is narrated as a brutal blow, the result can become silly, as no one could still be standing after that much trauma. When narrating a hit that's not a critical or a kill, focus on damage to the target's armor and shield, its state of pain or fatigue, and its position. “With a metallic crunch, your mace slams into his shield, leaving a dent. The knight swears in pain and recoils backward.” Fortunately, the English language leaves us no shortage for words you can use to describe the backward movement after an attack: Fall back, lurch, stagger, recoil, withdraw, retreat, and limp are all words to remember. So are descriptions of equipment damage such as blunt, break, dent, bang, splinter, crack, and tear.

**Misses:** Nothing is so frustrating for the player as to miss an attack that he has waited all round to roll for. Even worse is when his narration is “Ok, you miss. Steve, you’re up.” You owe it to the player to explain why his adventurer missed. If he's a highly experienced fighter, it's because the opponent fell back, or put up a desperate defense: “Still reeling from your last slash, the orc retreats before your onslaught. You can’t penetrate his defenses but you both know his time is coming soon.” If it's because he's a novice, your narration will reflect that: “Your blood is pumping with the heat of combat, and you over-extend your sword blow.”

**Near Misses:** If you roll a near miss on the player, a great rule of thumb is to vividly describe the attack before you provide the mechanical outcome. If the player knows you missed him, there's no tension no matter how vivid your imagery. But if he’s not sure yet whether you missed, he will hang onto every word for a clue as to what's coming.

**Slow Motion:** One of the coolest techniques you can achieve through vivid narration is the effect of 300**-**style fighting, with its alternating sequences of slow motion and high speed violence. The trick here is to use the present continuous verb tense (“is cutting”) when describing slow motion sequences, and the present tense (“cuts”) for fast action. “Marcus is leaping through the air, his blade is cutting to the left and right, gutting an orc with each slash, and then suddenly he lands and thrusts forward and his sword impales the orc chieftain through the heart.”

If these ideas don't directly help you, turn to your favorite books and movies and take notes on how the authors and directors show fight scenes. Take your notes into your next session, and make things visceral! With practice, you will develop your own repertoire of techniques to make your ***ACKS***battles come alive. It's worth the effort**.** If there’s any place that the art of storytelling can make more difference than any other in ***ACKS***, it’s in combat**.**

## Abducting the Action

Abduction is what transforms random tables and wandering monsters into a living, breathing game world. Abduction is what transforms a hodge-podge of materials into a coherent campaign. You must study this art, and master it, the way Miyamato Musashi studied sword-fighting. But what is abduction?

Abduction is a special type of reasoning defined as “the process of arriving at an explanatory hypothesis of a surprising circumstance.” The foremost philosopher of abduction, Charles Sanders Peirce, summarized abduction as follows:

The surprising fact, C, is observed;

But if A were true, C would be a matter of course;

Hence, there is reason to suspect that A is true.

For instance, assume the surprising circumstance that your car won’t start this morning. If it were true that your car battery were dead, then the fact that your car wouldn’t start would be a matter of course. So there is reason to suspect (abduce) that your car battery is dead.

At its core, abduction is guesswork, but it forms the basis of all natural science, medical diagnosis, and indeed much of human thought. When Newton developed the laws of gravity based on observing the motion of falling bodies, he was using abductive reasoning. When a physician is presented with a set of symptoms and diagnoses an illness to explain the symptoms, he is using abductive reasoning.

Abduction is also the method used by conspiracy theorists worldwide when they observe surprising facts about our world and piece together sinister explanations for them. America has its share of conspiracy theorists, but it is in Italy that conspiracy theory has been refined to its finest art form. The Italians have coined the word *dietrologia* for the art of finding hidden motives to explain seemingly everyday events. As explained in the Guardian, “rampant suspicion is the reason Italians love the dinner game of dietrologia, in which participants try to out-trump each other with paranoid ideas...”

We have much to learn from the dietrologists, for abduction is the secret art of the greatest gamemasters. It is the art of finding explanations that make the campaign better.

### **Finding Explanations That Make the Campaign Better**

Near the end of our multi-year Auran Empire campaign, our party began exploring another world in their crystal sphere, filled with strange and alien beings. To fill up this new world, we began liberally adapting unused encounters and dungeons from other products and places. One such encounter, from a hastily-chosen free adventure we had downloaded, involved an ettin in a jail cell. Ettins are common enough in the Auran Empire from whence the adventurers hailed, but were not a creature that was native to the alien world they were now on.

Now, outside of the context of the game, the reason an ettin appeared is simply that we accidentally put him somewhere he shouldn’t have been. The encounter he was a part of had been created for a different dungeon in a different campaign, where his presence would not have been surprising. But on the alien world, his presence was odd indeed and demanded justification or removal. We could have simply changed the ettin into another creature more appropriate to the new world. But we didn’t — instead, we abduced why an ettin might be present.

So, the surprising fact: An ettin on an alien world.

Our abduction: If there were a mysterious gate through spacetime that swept up creatures from the Auran Empire and deposited them on the alien world, the presence of an ettin would be a matter of course.

Our conclusion: There is reason to suspect that a mysterious gate through spacetime exists on the alien world.

By simply importing a legacy encounter from an old dungeon we had lying around, we had suddenly concluded that a mysterious portal existed somewhere that brings in creatures from the old world to the new. If we had simply changed the ettin into an alien, this portal would not have existed, and the game world would have been a less interesting place.

Note that we did not start with the idea of the portal — we started with the arbitrary appearance of the creature. This is not cause-effect reasoning; it's the opposite. It's finding an explanation for something that didn't have one — an explanation that makes the campaign (hopefully) better.

### **Making Abduction Work For You**

The art of abduction depends on having a set of “surprising facts,” that is, a circumstance you need to explain. Fortunately, such facts are never in short supply. Indeed, the easiest and most accessible method of brainstorming available to any ***ACKS***Judge is random generation of facts. This ***Judges Journal***is filled with random tables in its later chapters. If those aren’t enough, you can find hundreds of game accessories online that can randomly generate content for you — random adventure generators, random magic swords, random taverns, random jewelry, random monsters, and on and on.

For example, with a single click on a random adventure generator, we once randomly created a dungeon called “The Weird Citadel of Secrets” with many rooms. One of these was Room 45, which noted “there are cracks in the floor here” and “treasure: 500sp, 20gp.” The surprising fact here is “there is treasure in an otherwise empty room with cracks in the floor.” We abduced that “if the treasure belonged to adventurers who had fallen into the cracks in the floor, this would make sense.” And, presto! The cracks in the floor became large, menacing cracks which must have broken under the feet of some hapless hero, whose precious wealth lingers there still. This is the oracular power of the dice at work!

Another great source of “surprising facts” is through adaptation — porting content from other sources into your campaign setting. For instance, in the Auran Empire, we’ve made use of old D&D modules such as Isle of Dread, Against the Giants, and City of the Gods, each of which came from a different campaign setting (Mystara, Greyhawk, and Blackmoor respectively). You can do the same with articles from Dragon and Dungeon magazine or various internet sources; modules from other game systems; ideas stolen from your favorite TV shows, movies, and books; or anything else you can take inspiration from! The ettin from earlier is a great example of this.

A third method of generating “surprising facts” is to rely on your players, who are endlessly dietrological. For instance, let’s imagine that your adventurers are on a wilderness expedition through a supposedly-dangerous forest. You haven’t prepped any particular content for this forest, and are relying on procedural generation to create encounters as they explore. Thus, as they move from hex to hex, you roll random encounter checks. But let’s say the checks keep failing — the party has no encounters! They begin to get suspicious. As the session draws to a close, one of the players says, “It’s altogether creepy that we haven’t encountered anythingin this forest. There must be some great evil here that brooks no rivals to its power.” The other group members nod, and the party leader says, “next session, we will find it and kill it.” Here the players have abduced the presence of a monster from the surprising lack of wandering monsters. Since you haven’t already fleshed this area out, you decide to run with this idea. For next session, you work up the lair of a powerful monster in a nearby hex.

In this case, abduction is akin to the quantum mechanics of a role-playing game world. Explanations for the facts of the game world may not exist until they are consciously observed; until then they are merely potential explanations, ideas floating in the seas of possibility. Abduction is how you plunge into the ocean of ideas and find the best ones to explain the facts you're dealing with in your game.

Abductive reasoning is so powerful and useful that a skilled Judge can use it to run entire adventures on the fly. All such masters need is a bunch of interesting and completely unconnected events and a bit of imagination. We encourage you to master the art of abduction — but we caution against letting it become your primary method of running your game. Used too often, it can create a solipsistic world where things become true only if and when the players think so. That is ultimately detrimental to the game, removing real choice from the players. For a Judge committed to the agency theory of fun, the best way of using abduction is to have it help explain what has happened, not change what will happen.

## Fudging the Dice

Every time you pick up the dice, you are toying with fate — the fate of the players, the fate of the adversaries, the fate of the campaign world. When the dice come up in ways that were unexpected or create situations that are uncomfortable or unwanted, the temptation hangs omnipresent to say the dice said something they did not — to fudge.

Earlier in this chapter, we explained why you should never fudge a meaningful die roll, noting “the desire to fudge is founded on the faulty premise that you need to make sure people have fun. But it’s a mistake to believe that letting a character die destroys fun... It’s fudging the dice that destroys fun, by destroying the ability for the players to make meaningful choices.”

Having said that, it’s now time to discuss when you should fudge. Obviously, if you should never fudge a meaningful die roll, the universe of available fudging is limited to meaninglessdie rolls. But many die rolls aremeaningless, or seemingly meaningless. Should you fudge some of them? All of them?

The short answer is that you can fudge a die roll when it benefits play without impacting the ability of the players to make meaningful choices. As an illustration of this general point, here are three situations where fudging makes sense.

### Fudging for Speed When the Outcome Is Virtually Certain

Sometimes, the outcome of a situation is virtually certain. For instance, imagine that there are eight player characters about to attack one easy-to-hit adversary with only 2 hit points remaining. The first player character, Marcus, hits and inflicts 1 point of damage. In this circumstance, it might be appropriate for you to “fudge” the adversary’s remaining hp so that Marcus’s damage is enough to kill, in the interest of speed of play. After all, the adversary is going to die regardless, and depending on the system, going through the attack routine of another character will just waste a lot of time that might be better spent on more meaningful play.

Note that we said it **might** be appropriate to fudge. But it might not be. If the adversary is a notorious warlord, and whoever lands the killing blow will earn much honor, then who lands the killing blow is meaningful. Or if Marcus wanted to kill the adversary, but his comrade Quintus, acting next in the round, wanted to capture him, then the fact that Marcus didn't kill the adversary is very meaningful indeed.

A quick way to determine whether fudging for speed is appropriate is to ask, “If I just narrated this outcome without a die roll, would any player be deprived of meaningful choice and would any player character experience a meaningful difference in the game world?” If the answer is no, fudge away.

### **Fudging for Verisimilitude when the Alternative is Inconsistency**

Campaign worlds can range from the gonzo (in which internal consistency matters less than the “wow factor”, so that you might have space aliens riding psychic dinosaurs) to the naturalistic (in which internal consistency trumps the wow factor). But even at their most gonzo, most campaign worlds aim for some sense of verisimilitude, that is, some quality of realism, and the need for realism is reflected in much of the “mechanics” of game play.

For instance, the wandering monster tables in ***ACKS***make it more likely to encounter crocodiles near rivers and cougars near mountains; and more likely to encounter bears in general than to encounter ancient red dragons in general. Thus even a naturalistic GM can use these random encounter tables and have assurance that the will produce results that have some sense of verisimilitude or internal consistency. But sometimes even the best mechanics produce results that make no sense.

For instance, imagine that at the start of a wilderness adventure, only a few miles from the adventure’s starting village, the very first random encounter is the lair of an ancient red dragon. This “one in a thousand” outcomes poses a tremendous challenge to you as the Judge: Why is there an ancient red dragon living next door to the starting village, and why did no one know about it? Now, you might decide to run with this result. You might decide the dragon had only recently moved in, and its presence was not yet known; or that its presence had always been known, but that talking about it was a taboo, so the villagers hadn’t warned the PCs; or that the villagers were actually evil cultists in cahoots with the dragon, and the adventurers were just another sacrifice sent to die. All of these are examples of excellence in abductive reasoning — of finding a reason to explain a surprising fact.

But it’s also possible that you had previously established to the players that this was a safe village, with a sage who had briefed the party on local lore; and that the party’s crusaders had already used magic to ascertain the villager’s good intentions. In this case, the dice have created a situation that makes no sense within the context of what’s gone before. Here, you could fudge the dice to create a realistic situation.

Now, it might be suggested that this fudging has deprived the players of meaningful choice — for instance, of the chance to interact with the red dragon. But as we discussed at length earlier, agency requires precedent. The players in your game cannot make meaningful choices if the world can shift around them with no apparent consistency. There are times when consistency must trump randomness.

### **Fudging to Fix Mistakes**

From time to time, you will make a mistake. It happens to the best of us. At some point the caffeine-induced high will wear off, the Doritos will mess with your synaptic speed, and you’ll accidentally forget that a Kraken gets to do both standard damage and bonus constriction damage when grappling with a tentacle. Because of this mistake, the situation in the game world will bear no relation to what it would have been had you not erred. If you value consistency and realism in your game play (or are simply a compulsive perfectionist), this is a traumatic moment.

In the face of this situation, you can simply ignore the error and keep playing. This is fine in most cases, but if your error has been egregious and involves critical aspects of the game (or major adversaries), it won’t be acceptable. Your second option is to “rewind” gameplay — but this is often impossible.

Your third option is to fudge some die rolls to get things back on track. For example, if you realize you’ve been rolling only half the appropriate amount of damage for the villain, you might fudge some damage rolls to be higher over the next few rounds. Or, if you accidentally have been hitting a player character you actually missed, you could fudge your next few attack rolls to ensure some misses occur.

It's important to keep in mind the goal of this sort of fudging: You are not trying to alter the outcome to fit some preconceived notion of what the dice ought to have rolled. You are, rather, adjusting the dice to fix errors you created. Done properly, the outcome should be close to what would have happened if you'd never erred at all.

Are there any other circumstances where fudging makes sense in the context of agency-driven sandbox play? There might be, but we haven’t encountered them if so. The three above are by far the most common ones an ***ACKS***Judge will encounter. But every campaign is a law unto itself, and you might encounter situations we haven’t thought of that demand fudging. Be cautious but do what you deem best to maintain player agency in your world.

## Balancing Player Skill versus Character Skill

According to the agency theory of fun, a good tabletop RPG should afford players the opportunity to make meaningful choices. What determines the outcome of player choices? Should it be the player’s skill or the character’s? This question arises in every tabletop RPG, and few games offer good answers to every variant of it. Let me offer some examples:

**Example #1:** Chris is an expert in Krav Maga, where he learned how to disarm an intruder of a gun. His character Amdiron is a mage. Amdiron is currently being held at crossbow-point by an orc. Chris says, “Amdiron knows it’s a mistake to menace someone at close range with a firearm — I mean crossbow. Amdiron leans back against the crossbow subtly, then spins sideways and grabs the crossbow before the bolt can skewer him!” How does this get resolved?

**Example #2a:**Ted is an expert in ***ACKS***and other D20 fantasy games. He has memorized every monster manual ever published. His character Athelstan is a 1st level cleric who has never left the temple before. Athelstan’s fellow adventurers are about to enter a moldy room. Ted says, “Wait! Athelstan warns everyone to stay back while he steps forward. Is this mustard mold?” How does this get resolved?

**Example #2b:**Luke has never played an RPG before. His character Süreus is a 1st level mage with INT 18 and Knowledge (molds and slimes) proficiency. Süreus’s fellow adventurers are about to enter a moldy room. Luke says, “Wait! Uh… does my guy know anything about the mold stuff? Is it safe to proceed?” How does this get resolved?

**Example #3a:**Chad is a highly successful business developer who teaches seminars on negotiation. His character, Rakh, is a barbarian with a CHA of 3. Rakh is captured and brought before the king on charges of mayhem and vandalism. Chad says, “OK! Rakh bows deeply before the king and says the following: ‘Gracious majesty. If I have erred in my deeds in your kingdom, it is only because of a surfeit of martial vigor that lacks a proper outlet. Pray give me a quest worthy of my skill at arms and I will make right for you and your kingdom.” How does this get resolved?

**Example #3b:**Bob is a highly introverted theoretical botanist who hates human interaction. His character, Theodorus the Glorious, is a bard with a CHA of 18. Theodorus is captured and brought before the king on charges of cacophony and seduction of the innocent. Bob says, “Uh, Theodorus says whatever is appropriate to say to a king. Then he offers to hold a concert in the king’s honor but he makes it sound like a big deal.” How does this get resolved?

**Example #4:**Jenna is a police detective in real life. She is renowned for ability to spot the slightest disturbance in a crime scene. Her character, Aurëlyn, is a dull-witted fighter with INT 9. Aurëlyn is searching a hallway for traps. Jenna says, “Aurëlyn begins to carefully investigate the hallway. She subdivides it into 1’ x 1’ square sections and then scans each one looking for anything out of the ordinary. I can go into more detail on each square foot area saying what she looks for if you want, but I’m talking tiny disturbances of dust, strands of hair, tiny blood spatters, scuffs on the floor…” How does this get resolved?

**Example #5:**Todd is a former special forces operator who earned a bronze star in war. He has a zen-like ability to operate in the face of danger. His character, Bjorken, is a nebbish venturer with WILL 5. Bjorken has just encountered a powerful mummy with a dreadful aspect that puts paralyzing fear into the hearts of men. Todd says “Bjorken knows that freezing is the worst response to fear. To avoid freezing up, he takes a series of deep breathes and allows the fear to wash over him.” How does this get resolved?

If we want to take seriously player agency, we need to be able to answer these questions in a systematic way. Arbitrary decision-making on a case by case basis deprives the player of reliably demonstrating skill and reliably using his character. In each of the examples above, the problem has arisen because of a mismatch between the player’s abilities, knowledge, and skills, and the character’s. There are four ways to address this mismatch.

### Make Character Skill Paramount

Under this approach, the game emphasizes that the player is not the character. The character’s skills are the only thing that matter in resolving what happens.

This approach has been used in many story games that focus on “conflict resolution” rather than “task resolution.” In such games, the success or failure of tasks is left entirely to characters and dice. The player’s enjoyment usually arises from role-playing how the character emotionally responds to the outcomes. It has also been used in some “crunchy” RPGs, perhaps as something of a backlash to earlier game designs that emphasized player skill. ***Dungeons & Dragons 4E***’s Skill Challenges is an example. However, this is not the solution that ***ACKS II***adopts.

### Make Player Skill Paramount

Under this approach, the player is the character, more-or-less. The players skills are the character’s skills. You hit a foe by hitting the foe (hopefully with a boffer sword); you pick a lock by picking a lock; you negotiate with the king by negotiating with the king. The primary advantage of this approach is, of course, that it can create incredible immersion. By eliminating the barrier between player and character, the player can feel he is really “in the world.” The secondary advantage accrues to those who are highly skilled. People enjoy gaining and demonstrating mastery. We see this especially in videogames, where it has led to the rise of e-sports.

The disadvantage of this approach is that it precludes escapism. A weakling can never be a mighty warrior. A clumsy oaf can never play an agile thief. An awkward nerd can never be a charming bard. Since this sort of escapism is exactly what motivates many people to want to play an RPG, it is a poor choice for traditional RPG design. However, it is widely used in live-action role-playing games — or so we are told. None of us at Autarch have never dressed up in wizard robes and hurled socks at orcs while screaming “fireball.” Not once. Such claims are malicious lies. We hurled beanbags, not socks.

Obviously, this approach is not what ***ACKS II***uses.

### Make Player Skill and Character Skill into Non-Overlapping Magisteria

Under a regime of non-overlapping magisteria, character skill is paramount in some areas of the game, while player skill is paramount in other areas of the game. Which one matters depends on what you are doing.

This approach characterizes many old-school RPGs that favor “rulings over rules.” In the earliest version of ***Dungeons & Dragons****,* the game rules only covered a few aspects of play — primarily combat. Even mechanics taken for granted by the time of ***AD&D 1E,*** such as the “thief skills” of finding and disarming traps, didn’t exist. If a player wanted to search for a trap, that was resolved in a back-and-forth conversation with the GM. Matt Finch’s ***Quick Primer for Old School Gaming*** is one of the best illustrations of this style.

Gamers tend to either love or hate non-overlapping magisteria. Those who love it tend to praise it for allowing player skill to shine through. They acclaim dungeons such as ***Tomb of Horrors***, which strove to challenge players to think beyond the limits of the game’s mechanics. Fans of this approach tend to see the parts of the game with mechanics — such as combat — as of relatively less importance than those without. Combat is resolved with dice as a matter of convenience, but the best players avoid combat. Rolling dice is sometimes seen as a failure state.

Those who hate this approach tend to slam it for forcing players to engage in “Mother May I?” with the GM. These players find the subjective nature of the player-GM interaction to be a source of frustration rather than empowerment. They feel the back-and-forth narrative of exploration is time-consuming and gets in the way of the real fun of combat. They want to roll dice and kick ass with their +17 bonus.

We believe that non-overlapping magisterium is an unstable equilibrium. The history of RPG design has been that of games trending away from this approach and towards one of the others. Nowhere is this more visible than in the evolution of ***D&D***itself. That said, non-overlapping magisteria has many proponents and the method can and has sustained decades of active RPG campaigning. Whatever its faults, it seems to be a favored solution for some gaming groups.

Despite the fact that most of the other games within the Old School Renaissance adopt this approach, ***ACKS II***does not. Those who favor non-overlapping magisteria will find (probably to their horror) that ***ACKS II***takes a very different path.

### Synergy of Player and Character Skill

With the synergistic approach, both character skill and player skill matter. What happens in the game is not just a matter of one or the other. Here at Autarch, we consider the synergistic approach to be the Platonic ideal for role-playing games and it’s what we aim for in all of my game designs. Unfortunately, it’s mechanically hard to achieve and conceptually difficult to explain. We hope that this brief section can help you understand how ***ACKS II***intends for player and character skill to be balanced.

#### The Player is the Instruction Booklet, the Character is the Guy Following the Instructions

In the synergistic approach, the player can instruct his character on what to do, but whether the character successfully does do it is up to the character. To help illustrate the approach, let’s consider a real-world example of a husband-and-wife team building an Ikea bookcase. The bookcase came with an instruction booklet explaining how to build it. The wife is reading the instructions and the husband is following them. When the wife says, “Step 5: Insert Gizmo A into Plate B with Gadget C,” what happens? Some husbands can just… insert A into B using C. Other, less-gifted husbands, will find this beyond their mechanical aptitude and end up screaming that they never wanted a new bookcase anyway. In this analogy, the player is the wife, and the character is the husband.

Consider our earlier Example #1, where we needed to decide how much Chris’s expertise in Krav Maga is valuable to his character Amdiron’s efforts to deprive a guard of his crossbow. Following the guideline that “the player is the instruction booklet and the character is the guy following the instructions,” Mitch is the guy shouting “lean into the crossbow then spin and grab!” But Amdiron’s attempt is resolved based on how good Amdiron is at following Mitch’s instructions. In ***ACKS II***he’d throw for a disarm special maneuver using Amdiron’s characteristics.

Here, the player shows skill by choosing tactically sound options and the character show skills by implementing those tactics. We started with this example because it’s the most straightforward to understand. It is also the most commonly utilized approach for combat in all tabletop RPGs.

#### The Player Suspects, the Character Confirms

Let’s now turn to Example #2. In this example, Ted (the player) has concluded that party has encountered yellow mold, but Athelstan (Ted’s character) has no skill or proficiency in identifying mold. Conversely, Luke (the player) has no idea what yellow mold is, but his character is an expert in oozes. How does the Judge address this disparity?

In ACKS II, this situation is easily handled. Every player character has the Adventuring proficiency. The Adventuring proficiency was a concept we developed to address exactly the situation described in Example #2a. Sometimes players know things; the Adventuring proficiency explains why they know the stuff players know. It represents the sort of broad-but-shallow know-how that gets picked up informally over time.

The Adventuring proficiency explains why Ted’s character Athelstan might know about yellow-colored mustard mold. He happened to hear a folktale about it once. Or his uncle Athelfred died to mustard mold. Or he heard a rumor from another adventurer. Ted is therefore perfectly within his rights to have Athelstan say “Wait! Is this mustard mold?”

What the Adventuring proficiency does not do is confirm whether the mold that looks yellow is actually capital-M Mustard Mold. To get confirmation, the character needs to have a proficiency such as Knowledge (molds and slimes), Loremastery, and so on.

In the synergistic approach to data about the world, the player suspects and the character confirms. To make this approach work, sometimes the player’s suspicions have to be wrong.

In Example #2a, an ***ACKS*** Judge might respond: “the mold has the color and texture of honey mustard.” If Ted then asks, “does that mean it’s mustard mold, like, the monster that breathes death-spores?” the Judge would then respond “Athelstan doesn’t know. It might be, or it might just be mold that happens to be yellow.”

Or the Judge might respond “the mold has a reddish color, like congealed blood.” Ted, relieved it’s not yellow, says the party can advance. Sadly, the mold then explodes in a fireball. There’s no such monster as “blood mold” in the ACKS II Monstrous Manual that Ted read, but the Judge has secretly created such a monster and placed it in his world. (Note how the Adventuring proficiency in the future could justify Ted knowing about blood mold, even in an entirely different campaign!)

In Example #2b, the Judge should respond “Süreus can make a Knowledge proficiency throw.” If the proficiency throw succeeds, the Judge might say “Based on his expert knowledge of molds, Süreus is certain this is harmless mold,” or “Süreus recognizes this as toxic mold,” or “Süreus knows this is a never-before-seen species of mold, closely related to yellow mold, but different.” If the proficiency check fails, the Judge simply says, “Süreus isn’t able to identify this species of mold.” He could share the info he shared with Ted, though, about its color and texture.

Thus, the player shows skill by bringing his real-world and past gaming experience to bear in drawing tentative assessments of the game world, while the character shows skill by confirming those assessments. To our knowledge, ACKS II is the only game that has an Adventuring proficiency that explicitly provides characters with the background knowledge that players bring into a game.

#### The Player Talks, the Character Translates

Let’s turn to Example #3. In this example, Chad (the player) has the real-life equivalent of high Charisma and Diplomacy proficiency, while Rakh (Chad’s character) utterly lacks these things. Conversely, Bob (the player) has the real-life version of low Charisma, even though glorious Theodorus (Bob’s character) has CHA 18. Both players want their characters to persuade the king to favor them. How does this get resolved? In the synergistic approach to interacting with NPCs, the player speaks and the character translates.

The king in Example #3 does not speak Modern English. He speaks Classical Auran. Chad and Bob do not speak any of those languages. They speak Modern English. How are Chad and Bob communicating with the king? Rakh and Theodorus are translating for them, from Modern English to Classical Auran.

Chad is a glib speaker of Modern English. Rakh, unfortunately, is a terrible translator. When Chad says “Gracious majesty. If I have erred in my deeds in your kingdom, it is only because of a surfeit of martial vigor that lacks a proper outlet. Pray give me a quest worthy of my skill at arms and I will make right for you and your kingdom,” Rakh says something like “gentle king, I broke your laws because I am strong and your kingdom is filled with weaklings. But maybe I could kill something for you since you can’t do it yourself?” Chad doesn’t know that’s exactly what Rakh said, because he doesn’t speak Classical Auran. He just knows what he wanted Rakh to say. Sadly, Rakh’s plea probably doesn’t go too well. How badly it goes is resolved with a reaction roll using Rakh’s Charisma.

Conversely, Bob is a taciturn and hesitant speaker, but Theodorus is a fluent and diplomatic translator. When Bob says “say whatever is appropriate to say to a king,” Theodorus translates that beautifully into the diplomatically-appropriate wording. Again, Bob doesn’t know what Theodorus said, he just knows what he wanted him to say. Here, though, it probably goes well — how well is, again, resolved with a reaction roll using Theodorus’s Charisma.

Some people have a knee-jerk negative reaction to this approach. These players are usually excellent actors who make an effort to role-play their characters, and they feel it renders those efforts meaningless. It’s not fair, they’ll say, that Chad doesn’t get rewarded for his role-play.

We disagree: The player’s words are not rendered meaningless by the synergistic approach. The character is tryingto follow his player’s intent to the best of his ability, and it’s the Judges job to use the player’s role-play to figure out what that is. “I will kill you if you cross me again” is never translated as “I will give you treasure if you don’t cross me.” “I will give you great wealth if you help me” is never translated as “I will give you sex if you help me.” In ***ACKS II***the player’s words are categorized by the Judge as either Diplomacy, Intimidation, or Seduction, with different situational modifiers for each. Choosing which approach to take, and figuring out how to take advantage of the situational modifiers, is a matter of player skill. The player is the one “reading the room,” theorizing about the likely mindset of the NPCs, guessing what might entice them or frighten them.

Hence, this approach is no way makes role-play unimportant. What it does do is give people like Bob a chance to enjoy playing someone they’re not in real life — a smooth and suave diplomat, a frightening menace, a sexy seducer, and so on.

#### The Player is the Boss, the Character Just Works Here; the Player Looks, but the Character Sees

In Example #4, Jenna (the player) is a fastidious police detective with world-class skills at searching a crime scene. But Aurëlyn (Jenna’s character), is just a dumb thug with a sword. How does the Judge resolve Jenna’s detailed narration of Aurëlyn’s trap searching?

The synergistic approach to investigation and searching is built on two facts. First, some people are conscientious and diligent about performing long detail-oriented tasks, and some people aren’t. Second, some people are mindful of details and some people are oblivious to them. In both cases, whether a long-detailed oriented task is completed successfully, or a minor detail is noticed, is essentially a stochastic output influenced by the person’s conscientiousness, diligence, and mindfulness.

The easiest example we can offer is proofreading. Before Autarch publishes a rulebook, we send it to a proofreader for a thorough review. The proofreader reads the book cover to cover searching for errors. When the proofreader spots an error, we fix it. Nevertheless, errors creep in. If we tabulated every error in the book in advance, we would not be able to predict which errors would get spotted and which wouldn’t. It’s totally random. The proofreader’s mind might wander on page 17 and miss an obvious “you’re” that should be a “your.” It doesn’t matter how hard the proofreader tries. Errors are unpredictable, undesired… Yet, at scale, inevitable. As publishers, we can’t predict the exact errors spotted, but we can reliably predict that if our best proofreader does the job, 95% of the errors will be spotted and 5% won’t. He succeeds on anything but a 1.

If a proofreader, diligently reading a rulebook line by line with bright lights, coffee, and a comfortable chair in an air-conditioned office, can’t reliably find all the errors, why do we expect that a thief working in a shadowy corridor with a clumsy pole will find all the traps? Just because a player wants his character to spend 10 minutes carefully plumbing every inch of the flagstones for cracks, that doesn’t mean the character actually manages to spend every second doing so without his mind wandering, and it doesn’t mean he actually finds all the cracks.

What is true for long and thorough searches is also true for instantaneous awareness. The mind is bombarded with sensation; it does not perceive all that it senses. If I misplace my keys on the kitchen table, they are effectively lost for all time, until my wife walks up and spends 0.5 seconds before noticing that they are in the fruit ball near the large banana with grey spots. How she is able to do this is an unfathomable mystery to me. I look, but she sees. No matter how much I look, I do not see.

The difference between the to-do list, and the doing, between looking and seeing, between listening and hearing, needs to be modeled. In ACKS II it’s modeled with Searching and Listening throws. It is our judgment that this differential is where “rulings not rules” / “mother may I” gaming fails, because it assumes that characters are infallibly mindful and attentive as long as their players say they are. They aren’t. No one is. But some people are better at it than others, and so some characters are better at it than others.

Here, the player shows skill by deciding when, where, and how long to search. The character shows skill by performing the search.

#### The Player is the Prefrontal Cortex, but the Character is the Amygdala

It’s often said that the player is the soul of the character. But which part of the soul? Since antiquity, sages have known that the soul or mind is fractured. Plato spoke of reason, spirit, and appetite as the three parts of the soul. 2500 years later, Freud spoke of supergo, ego, and id as the three parts of the mind. Contemporary neuroscientists speak of executive function being located in the prefrontal cortex, while emotional response is modulated by the amygdala.

In the synergistic approach to player character behavior, the player’s skill represents the prefrontal cortex, while the character’s skill represents the amygdala. If you prefer, the player is the ego and the character is the id. We assume that most of the time, the player character is under the control of his reason, that his executive function is serving to bring about rational ends-oriented decision making. But sometimes the player character may succumb to his appetites, to his id, to the activation of his amygdala.

That leads us to Example #5, where Todd (the player) is fearless in real life, while Bjorken (Todd’s character) is actually quite skittish. In ACKS II, characters confronted by certain monsters must make Paralysis saving throws or be paralyzed with terror until the monster attacks or goes out of sight. Bjorken’s low WILL would impose a penalty to this throw.

Mechanics like these do not necessarily detract from player agency. The body’s involuntary responses to stress are one of the challenges that the game world puts on characters, and it’s up to the players to figure out how to work with or around that fact.

After 40 years spent playing tabletop RPGs and 11 years spent designing them, we are convinced that synergizing player and character skill in the manner described above is the best choice for fun gameplay that maximizes player agency while still permitting players to play characters who are different than themselves. ***ACKS II***is built around this approach, and we hope that you will find it a refreshing method of play.

## Hosting Your Game

Running an ***ACKS*** session, especially your first time, is hard, and a first-time Judge can quickly make a mess of things. On the other hand, a well-practiced and experienced Judge can make hosting an ***ACKS*** session seem easy; he knows all the secrets for gathering folks, getting them in the head space to game, and then running them through. Let's talk about what those secrets are.

### **When and Where**

One of the first challenges you face in deciding to host a session of ***ACKS***is determining when and how long you’ll play. The specific day is going to depend on your and your players’ schedules. With adult players, we generally have had the most success in getting groups to play on Mondays or Thursdays. By avoiding the precious weekend nights you take a lot of pressure off the participants.

After years of trying various patterns of play, we’ve found that a four- to five-hour session length is optimal. Four to five hours is, not coincidentally, about the length of dinner and a movie, a tailgate plus football game, or a concert plus drinks. If you play after work, it means you can start play at 7pm and wrap up before midnight, which fits comfortably into most people's after-work schedules.

For venue, a quiet room with comfortable seating and a large table is ideal. The best choice is your own home, provided you have a large enough table or living room. Of course, if one of the players has a dedicated game room where you can have rules and miniatures spread out, go with that. We generally recommend avoiding games in public places such as game stores or coffee shops unless you are extremely experienced. Such environments are usually loud and uncontrolled, which makes it hard for introverts to feel immersed and comfortable. That said, if you have a villainous roommate or live in a Tokyo sleep-coffin, it might be your best option.

An increasingly popular option today is to play online using a **virtual tabletop** (VTT). A virtual tabletop allows you to gather players from all around the world, perhaps uniting old friends to game together. If you’re going to play ***ACKS***on a VTT, we recommend using Foundry Virtual Tabletop. To coincide with ***ACKS II****,* we commissioned development of a full Foundry module that implements the mechanics of the game and incorporates a huge database of abilities, monsters, equipment, and more to call on.

Whatever you choose, it's best to find one venue for your campaign and stick with it. You can try to make a rotating venue (one in which each player hosts for a week, for instance) work, but beware that the “friction of war” will frequently cause tardy and lost players who end up at the wrong location.

### **Rewarding Refreshments**

Role-playing games are best enjoyed with food and drink. Every party's taste in refreshments will vary, of course, ranging from the traditional Mountain Dew and chips to fruit smoothies and diced vegetables, but your party can't be expected to defeat the dark lord on an empty stomach. Nor for that matter can you speak for five hours on a parched throat.

Here’s a simple technique to always ensure there's a large and varied supply of food and drink at each gaming session: offer a 5% bonus on earned experience points to players that bring munchies. To kick things off, you can even offer an additional bonus (+5% more) to whoever brings the best array of refreshments. It rewards pro-social behavior and encourages everyone to chip in.

One important note on refreshments: Beware the drunken gamer. Whether the party is attempting to role-play or devise battle tactics, a drunkard gets in the way and ruins the experience of the other players. While we keep beer on hand, we also maintain a hard and fast rule at our campaigns that anyone who gets drunk is ejected from play. We save our serious drinking for beer-and-pretzels board games, or visits to the local inns and taverns.

### **Running a Session**

With a half-dozen or so friends gathered around the table, gossip and small talk is a certainty. The players can easily chat away for hours and then complain that they didn't have enough time to play. It can seem rude or intimidating to interrupt everyone and demand their attention on Your Game, but that’s your job as Judge. Give everyone about 10 minutes to get settled, and then start the game. Having a routine to open each session really helps send the signal that it’s time to get started.

In our own campaigns, we usually open each session by playing some epic trailer music and giving a short recap of the prior session. The recap reminds everyone of what went on the last time we all gathered, and usually prompts roars of laughter, a lot of “oh that’s right,” and pledges of renewed vengeance or greed. After that, we quickly describe where the party is, and ask them what they want to do.

This technique, of describing the scene and then asking the players what they want to do, is one of the main tools in any gamemaster’s arsenal for maintaining the pace of the game. Plan to use it frequently over the next few hours. Anytime the players get bogged down arguing for more than 10 – 15 minutes, or seem like they are at a loss as to how to proceed, give them an updated summary of the situation at hand and ask them for their actions. It will usually trigger them to do something. Be sure to mention how long it’s been since the last update you provided, what people are currently doing, any objects they haven’t yet explored, and offer some sense that time is running out.

For example, consider the following description, offered to a party that isn’t sure what to do next: “OK, so you’ve been standing in the vampire’s tomb arguing in hushed whispers for the past ten minutes, unsure what to do. Viktir is lurking in the corner, while Marcus is eyeballing the exit. The black curtain still hangs across the south wall, covered with dust and cobwebs, untouched in centuries. In the distance you can now hear low groaning.” The party might decide to head for the exit, or check out the curtain, or get ready to fight whatever is groaning, but they’ll do something.

After about four hours of play, it’ll be time to wind the session down. When the session ends, if the party isn’t in a safe area, be sure to record how much damage they’ve suffered, what spell slots they’ve expended, and other notes on their condition — players are not very incentivized to remember such things, after all!

If possible, it’s courteous to maintain your scheduled duration as a hard deadline. The major exception to this rule is that you should try never to end a session in the middle of a fight — not only is it bad for immersion, it’s quite hard to keep track of the tactical details after a week. The ideal way to end the session is after a hard fight or dramatic encounter, about 10 – 15 minutes before everyone needs to head out. After a good game, there’s usually an enjoyable “post-game recap” where people discuss what happened. It’s fun to review your own game, and it’ll provide valuable insight to you as to what people most liked and disliked in the session.

With that, we’ve covered the basics!

## Managing Problems and Players

Once you start running ***ACKS***or any other RPG, you will likely, sooner rather than later, see a shouting match develop. It could be between you and one of your players; more likely it will be between two players. If you’re lucky, it'll be at least thinly-veiled as in character; if you’re not lucky, it will involve a messy break-up over when he cheated on her with the elven spellsword, or worse.

Role-playing games can be emotionally charged, and unlike videogames, there isn’t the filter of a monitor and gamepad between us and the other player. What happens is in your face. As the Judge of the game, you’ll be the person who assembled the group, and one of the signs of a great gamemaster is the ability to manage and control social problems within the group you’ve assembled. Even better is to prevent them from ever occurring.

Therefore, it’s time to step away from the world of your imagination and turn to a messier world: The world of problem players, personality conflicts, and social pitfalls.

### **Player Versus Player**

Many, though not all, problems in role-playing game campaigns arise when one or more of the players is out of step with the overall social dynamic of the rest of the players. There are three basic social dynamics in which players interact in a tabletop campaign: **Collective**, **Competitive-Collective**, and **Individualist**. Each of these social styles has its own implicit rules that govern how the players behave towards each other.

The Collective play style is characterized by a “one for all, all for one” mentality. Each of the players subsumes his individual play into the greater good of the campaign. In a Collective campaign, the implicit rules are: (1) each player will create a character that fits into and gets along well with the collective; (2) each player is entitled to a chance to enjoy the campaign simply by virtue of being a fellow player; and (3) the collective as a whole will democratically make major campaign decisions, and all the players will abide by them.

The Competitive-Collective play style might be summarized as “we’re in this together, but I don’t have to like it.” In the Competitive-Collective campaign, the group has implicitly agreed to the following: (1) no player will create a character that cannot fit into the collective, though they needn’t be friendly to each other; (2) no player is entitled to enjoy the campaign except by virtue of his character; and (3) the collective as a whole will democratically make major campaign decisions, and all the players will abide by them.

The Individualist play style might be summarized as “all against all” or “every man for himself.” Here the implicit rules are: (1) each player makes his own character and decisions and accepts the consequences; (2) no player will get angry out of game at another player for actions of their respective characters; and (3) major campaign decisions will be made based solely on what the characters decide in the game.

Sometimes the social dynamic simply evolves out of a particular ruleset or campaign theme, or out of years of playing with the same group. Other times the group agrees in advance. Opinions will vary widely as to which of these social dynamics is the best. ***ACKS***can support all three types of play. Regardless of what your group’s social dynamic ends up being, social problems occur when part of the group is out of sync with the whole. What follows are some common examples of problems.

###### **Dead and Back Again**

If you've followed our advice regarding the agency theory of fun, then character death is bound to happen sooner or later. When character death occurs, it’s the players’ responsibility to decide how to handle the slain character’s gear, henchmen, and other property, while it's your responsibility to introduce the player's new character into the game as quickly and seamlessly as possible. Both responsibilities need to be handled in accordance with the social dynamic of a group.

The recommended way to handle a slain character’s property is to have it pass on to his heir (discussed in the ***ACKS II Revised Rulebook****,* p. XX). But what happens if instead the party decides to ignore the dead character’s will and just plunder him? It will depend on the social dynamic of your campaign.

* In a Collective campaign, you need to remind the players that the slain character’s will should be honored and that they are violating the agreed-upon social dynamic of the group. In most Collective campaigns, the players are running “good guys” so a gentle reminder is usually enough to put the group back on track. If the majority of the players have a problem with this, then you probably don’t actually have a Collective campaign!
* In a Competitive-Cooperative campaign, you need to ask the players to think about whether they want to leave the new character with nothing to inherit, and to contemplate what will happen if the new character discovers what has been done. That said, if the majority of the other players want to be “naughty” about looting their dead ally, then accept it and move on. The group is probably leaning into Competitive more than Cooperative, but that’s OK as long as its out in the open.
* In an Individualist campaign, you don’t need to do anything. If the slain character didn’t make arrangements to have a trusted henchman, powerful patron, or other NPC ally execute his will, that’s his own fault. It’s everyone man for himself!

The traditional way to handle the introduction of a new character is to have the party stumble upon a prisoner found left for dead in one of the next few rooms (often with a suspiciously similar class and name...). It's quick and it works. But sometimes, when the surviving characters find the new player character, they decide not to let him into the party. What do you do as Judge now? Again, it will totally depend on the social dynamic of your campaign.

* In a Collective campaign, you need to remind the players that the new character should expect to be admitted readily and probably given some gear and assistance to get into play swiftly. In most Collective campaigns, the players have created heroic characters, so this is not a stretch. But even if their **characters** are world-weary cynics with deep suspicions about the world, in a Collective game the players agreed to put the group ahead of the individual, and agreed that each player is entitled to participate, so the need to introduce and integrate their fellow player should trump in-character behavior. Again, if the majority of the players have a problem with this, then you probably don’t actually have a Collective campaign!
* In a Competitive-Cooperative campaign, you need to remind the players that the new character should expect to be admitted, but probably not warmly; the player can expect his new character to get lots of in-character questioning or wisecracks and a “show me what you can do” attitude. Still, it should be a given that ultimately he’ll be admitted to the party and play will go on.
* In a true Individualist campaign, again, you don’t need to do anything. Here the new character had better hope he’s been created with knowledge, skills, or other utility to his prospective comrades, as the players are not beholden by any social contract to be nice to him. It might turn out that the party refuses to take the new character along. In response, he might follow them to aid them and prove his worth by backstabbing them during their next fight! Of course, if they fear backstabbing, the characters might kill their erstwhile comrade.

###### **That’s What My Character Would Do!**

Imagine that a player’s old character has died, and a new character has been introduced into the group, as discussed above. Unbeknownst to his new party members, however, this new character holds a radically different alignment than his new comrades. During the party’s next engagement, he ruthlessly betrays them, leading to the death of the entire party. “Why did you do that?” a player will certainly ask. “That's what my character would do!” says the traitor. What do you do as Judge this circumstance?

If this happens in a Collective campaign, then there's been a violation of all of the implicit rules of the campaign. First, the player introduced a character who didn’t fit into the collective. Second, by purposefully getting everyone killed, the player didn’t respect the other players’ right to enjoy the game. And third, by purposefully causing the campaign to end, the player breached the agreement to democratically decide major campaign decisions. You should stop the game, pull the offending player aside, explain that his behavior is out of bounds for this campaign, and rewind. A continuously problematic player should be ejected.

If this happens in a Competitive-Collective campaign, there’s still been a violation of the social dynamic, because the player introduced a character who didn’t fit into the collective and because he purposefully caused the campaign to end unilaterally. That said, since this game is partly Competitive, and there’s a strong argument that you ought not intervene with GM fiat. I think the best way to handle this situation is to have a quick player vote — either to rewind events or let them stand.

If this happens in an Individualist campaign, then it’s possible that nothing wrong has happened. The party wasn’t required to take in the new player character, and characters aren’t required to be nice to each other. As Judge, your responsibility is to remind the betrayed players that this is the sort of game they’re playing and they agreed not to get angry out of game. However, it’s also possible that the traitor has just gone out of his way to purposefully wreck the fun, not because of what his character would do, but to get back at the party that let him die (and thus violating the proscription against getting angry). Resolving this can get complex!

The general rule when addressing the solution to the “TWMCWD” problem is thatit doesn’t matter whether the problem behavior is “actually” what the character would do. It doesn't matter whether the player is a consummate role-player playing a black-hearted villain, or just a jerk. All that should matter is whether it’s a problem.

In a Collective campaign, there’s an implicit agreement to create characters that are “one for all, all for one,” so if a player makes a character who is a sociopathic traitor, **he has created the problem**. If he purposefully chooses to role-play a jerk when everyone else has agreed to role-play nice people that means... he’s choosing to be a jerk. And the better he is at role-playing, the more of a jerk he chooses to be. If you’re running a Collective campaign, you don’t want jerks. Whether they are actually jerks or pretending to be jerks doesn’t matter at all.

On the other end of the spectrum, in an Individualist campaign, the players have implicitly agreed that it's “every man for himself,” and that they won’t let treachery in game make them angry out of game. But if one player behaves in such a way as to make it impossible for the other players to not be angry, then **he has created the problem**. For instance, imagine that in the last six campaigns, a hypothetical player named Bob has **always** played a sociopathic thug who **always**tries to kill the party when they are weak. In the seventh campaign, the party members can hardly be blamed for murdering all of Bob's characters on sight. Bob might be “in character” in his treachery, and the party members acting totally out of character in dispatching them, yet it’s Bob who is the problem.

### Player versus Judge

Anyone who has ever watched a baseball player shout at an umpire over a bad call is familiar with the love-hate relationship that players have with their pastime’s referees. The same is true of ***ACKS*** players and their relationship with their Judges. There will be times that players can get very… rowdy…with you over a particular ruling, encounter, or choice. And, as between us judges, there are times when you might have some sore feelings towards your players. At some point, someone will check Twitter while you are relaying information that warns of a trap ahead, then bitch at you when their character walks into said trap and dies. It’s hard not to be annoyed (try to remember, they’re only upset because they care).

But such happenings are minor and if you are following the guidelines in this book — not railroading your players, making clear and fair rulings, playing honestly with the adversaries, and so on — then they are unlikely to derail your play. Sometimes, however, more serious issues can arise between you and one or more players, and these can be some of the most uncomfortable challenges for any GM.

###### Theme Park Attendees

Imagine if you were allowed to choose between two vacations: a safari in Africa or a trip to Disney’s Animal Kingdom. An actual safari involves vaccinations, mosquitoes, tents, jet lag, and the risk of being eaten by lions or rabid gazelles. A trip to Disney’s Animal Kingdom involves luxury hotels with air conditioning and a carefully-controlled experience designed to give great memories. A lot of people are going to choose the theme park.

Similarly, some players don’t want an RPG world in motion with real risk. They want a theme park RPG. Now, it is our considered judgment that these players are missing out. We believe that participating in an agent-focused sandbox campaign is the most fun a player can have in a role-playing game. There are other hobbies that can afford a better theme park experience. MMORPGs, for instance, that eschew permanent character death and allow infinite chances to succeed at quests and stories, are ideal platforms for theme park play. Only the tabletop RPG can offer agency-centered sandbox play. And that’s why the advice in this book is all about creating a living, breathing world-in-motion that empowers your players with the agency to make real choices in the game.

But Autarch is unfortunately not the exclusive arbiter of fun on Planet Earth, and many people find joy in things we find boring — golf, gardening, and scrapbooking come to mind. Conversely, many people don’t take pleasure in things we enjoy, like military history, spreadsheets, or sandbox campaigns. And there is a downside to our style of campaign. With real choice comes real risk of loss — of loot, of XP, of henchmen, of a character. Some players simply don’t want that. They want the theme park, not the safari.

If you have one or more players like this, you’ll find out the first time your group experiences a terrible setback — when a beloved character dies, or the party fails to achieve an important quest. They will let you know in no uncertain terms that they are not interested in losing, did not sign up to be killed, and cannot believe you didn’t run the game in such a way as to make sure such tragedy didn’t ensue.

So what do you do?

If you and the majority of your other players are enjoying the campaign, I think the right thing to do is to be honest with the upset players: Say that you aren’t running a theme park, don’t intend to run a theme park, think a sandbox is a better way to play, and ask them to give it a chance. They might grow to like it.

But sometimes they won’t want to give it a chance, and sometimes they will give it a chance and still not like it. When that happens, the best thing to do is probably to ask the upset players to leave the campaign. If they stay in the campaign, it often creates bad blood. I’ve seen friendships end over events in games, and it’s never worth it. It’s better to just agree to disagree about what you want out of your RPG hobby.

Now, it could also be the case that most or even all of your group may decide they’d rather visit a theme park than play in a world in motion. If everybodywants a theme park, a rollercoaster, and a railroad, and you’re offering a safari, a sandbox, and a story web, you have a serious problem.

So then what? Then it’s best to run another campaign using another system. Or you can attempt to play ***ACKS***as a theme park. Who knows? There’s no statute on how to have fun. It’s what you make of it.

### The Politicization of Gaming

The reality of 21st century America is that virtually everything has been politicized. Turn on ESPN, and it’s politics. Read your FB feed, and it’s politics. And, lately, it has spilled into gaming in a big way. It’s become common for political discussions to arise over tropes in RPGs that have been around for decades.

We are not going to say that politicization is a good thing or a bad thing. There are lots of people who believe that everything ought to be made political, because allowing things to be apolitical is itself a political choice to support the status quo. Conversely, there are lots of people who believe that escapist entertainment that avoids politics can be healthy and heal divides between people of different opinions.

What we are going to say is that politicization is a big thing, and you must decide how to handle it for your campaign. There are two distinct areas to concern yourself with and a few strategies to take for each.

The first area is discussion of real-world politics at the gaming table. Your options here are to ban it or permit it. We take the view that it’s better to ban it for the same reason that polite dinner conversation used to exclude politics and religion. Politics tends to be an emotional topic and if players are from different political tribes, a single partisan comment can quickly spark an argument that can derail play and cause bad feelings all around.

Even if everyone in the gaming group shares the same political views, it’s not clear it makes the experience of playing an RPG better to talk about it. In today’s media-saturated world, political headlines hit us 24/7 on our smart phones and social feeds. It can be really freeing to get away from that, whatever your beliefs, and just play the game. And it’s a lot easier to immerse yourself in a fantasy world when you’re not thinking about the impact of tariffs on global trade.

Now, to be clear, this is equally true for table talk about pretty much anything unrelated to RPGs, especially if it’s a topic people get really partisan about. You don’t want players spending game time chatting about the latest UNC vs. Duke basketball game, or Star Trek vs. Star Wars, either. That said, if you and your players are all like-minded politically and you want to talk politics, go for it. As we said above, there’s no statute on how to have fun.

The second area is discussion of politics that arises from actions in the game. Imagine you are running an ***ACKS***campaign in which the player characters are mercenaries in ancient Rome. In that era, it was altogether customary (indeed, considered downright merciful) to enslave captured prisoners-of-war. So it’s entirely plausible, in the context of the game, for an NPC to hire the player characters to round up a gaggle of prisoners and escort them to the slave markets. But it’s entirely possible a player might balk at this, not because of anything related to role-playing, but simply because real-world slavery is evil.

This sort of situation is a lot trickier to handle — you can’t handle it by simply banning it, because the discussions will arise inevitably from in-game activity. There are three basic strategies. Because we like to make up jargon, we will call them the **Historicist** strategy, the **Presentist** strategy, and the **Bespoke** strategy.

The Historicist strategy holds that the player characters should act according to the game world’s moral values, not their own. In a Historicist campaign set in ancient Rome, the PCs would be expected to role-play as if they viewed the world the way people of that era viewed it. They’d simply escort the prisoners to the slave markets and that would be that. Your players are exploring how people very different than themselves lived and thought. That can be really freeing to some… and really upsetting to others.

The Presentist strategy holds that the player characters should carry the players’ real-world moral values into the campaign and the GM should take that into account when running the game. So, for instance, in a Presentist campaign set in ancient Rome, the PCs will have the same attitudes towards slavery that their players do — presumably as contemporary Westerners this will be one of loathing and contempt. In turn, it’s your responsibility as GM to set up a world and story web that allows the player characters to act on their attitude. For instance, give them the chance to join Spartacus’s slave revolt, or to start their own. In a Presentist campaign, your players are exploring how people like themselves would behave in a world with different moral and political structures.

Finally, the Bespoke strategy holds that the GM should build the players’ real-world moral values into the fabric of the campaign world itself, hand-tailoring the world to the players’ sensibilities. For instance, in an RPG set in ancient Rome, the GM might downplay the role of slavery in the world, so it only occurs “off camera,” or even replace it with serfdom or indenture. Or the GM might simply not set the game in ancient Rome at all, but in some alternative world that has centurions and Caesars but not slaves. In a Bespoke campaign, your players can feel comfortable exploring a world with familiar moral and particular structures.

There are pros and cons to each approach. The Historicist strategy affords the widest opportunity for role-playing experiences in worlds quite unlike our own. But most of humanity’s history and lots of fictional human futures all feature cultures with political and moral values that were downright awful. Adopting the Historicist strategy can mean your players are playing villains by today’s standards.

The Bespoke strategy can make it easier to avoid unsettling topics, but it can also make it impossible to explore certain worlds or role-play certain characters in their original format. Middle-earth is grounded in J.R.R. Tolkien’s conservative Catholicism, and role-playing Aragorn in a Bespoke Middle-earth where God-given kingship and nobility by blood are pernicious would change the plot of ***Lord of the Rings***by more than a little.

The Presentist strategy is perhaps the middle ground between the two, which can be appealing to many players. But the Presentist strategy can lead to a certain straightjacketing of the set of choices available. The players may feel morally obligated to “do something” about injustice in the game world even when it is impossible to do so.

Which strategy to adopt is very much a choice that needs to be particular to your gaming group. It’s something you should talk about in advance of the campaign and agree to with your players. If it turns out that your players have widely different opinions on the matter, it’s better to find out before you launch the campaign. It may well be that some players may be incompatible with the strategy you’d like to adopt, or with each other for any given strategy.

## Running a Campaign

Running a long-term RPG campaign is the hallmark of the best Judges. The greatest long-term campaigns — Greyhawk, Blackmoor, Glorantha, Forgotten Realms, Arduin, Wilderlands — ran for decades, and literally changed the way people thought about fantasy and gaming. Such hallowed success is probably beyond us all these days, but running a long-term campaign is nevertheless an admirable goal and a wonderful experience.

We define a successful long-term ***ACKS*** campaign as a campaign that runs on a regular schedule that allows the players to complete the experience available to them in ***ACKS***. That could mean advancing from level 1 to 14; that could mean exploring the complete sandbox you’ve built; that could mean being crowned king. What it does **not** mean is a slow death because of lack of interest and involvement. And yet that’s the fate of most campaigns. It doesn’t need to be that way!

### **Scheduling for Success**

The first step towards running a successful campaign is scheduling for success. During the halcyon days of Greyhawk, Gary Gygax ran his campaign six days out of seven, and he was writing not just the campaign, but all the rules, spells, and content! While in today’s world it’s hard to be as hardcore as Gary, nevertheless steady play is essential to sustain a game. The most sustainable schedule for an RPG campaign is either weekly or fortnightly. Successful RPG campaigns are sustained by commitment — by the sense that “it’s all real” — and that requires ongoing reinforcement of the activities. Campaigns are similar to TV shows in that they require an ongoing immersion in an imaginary world. Two weeks seems to be about the longest length of time most people can be away from their imaginary worlds without losing track of what's going on. One week keeps it even fresher in their mind.

The single biggest obstacle towards running RPGs on a weekly basis is the false belief that maintaining a weekly game is impossible in today’s world because we are all “too busy.” But most of us are not, in fact, too busy. The real reason we seem too busy is because we have more options for things to do. After all, we live in the future! And in the future people have access to mobile phones, on-demand movies, endless videogames, non-stop social media, and more.

Consider that the average casual video gamer is now playing for 20 hours per week — or that the average person watches more than 33 hours of TV per week. Consider that a dedicated World of Warcraft gamer who raids twice per week and grinds the other nights spends 40 hours per week in his game. Consider the time spent by dedicated golfers, who may hit the course every weekend; or by ESPN enthusiasts, who watch sports daily plus all day Sunday as a major social gathering.

In contrast to these 20-to-40 hour commitments, running a successful RPG campaign takes about 5 hours once per week plus at most 8 – 10 hours of prep time by the GM. Any of the hobbyists above have more than enough leisure time to run a weekly RPG campaign. If you’re like most people, the real question is not “do I have time?”, but really “is this actually one of the things I want to make a priority to do with my time?”

If the answer is yes, read on. If the answer is no, then you are better off running casual one-off sessions then attempting a major campaign. That's your choice.

### **How Many Players?**

How many players should you invite to your weekly ***ACKS***campaign? Sadly, ***ACKS***Judges are rather unevenly distributed, and as a result some gamemasters struggle to find even one or two players while others run the “only game in town” and have to actively limit their players to a manageable number. Acknowledging that reality, there is still a definite sweet spot for how many players you should aim for: three to seven, with five being ideal.

Why is five players the ideal number? With five players, you have enough for the players to cover most of the core classes, without so many players that henchmen and followers become unnecessary. You can give each player sufficient in-game attention without slowing the game down. If one or even two players can’t make a particular session, you can still run with a group of three or more. And in terms of seating, most dinner tables have six seats, meaning there's one for you and five for them.

If you are one of the lucky ***ACKS***Judges who has access to a wide pool of players, you can certainly run with seven (I do), though it will slow the game down a bit. If you have more than seven, though, and you’re new to ***ACKS****,* it might be better if you can split them up into two groups, or get another gamemaster to help you out.

### **Tabletop Campaigns are Team Sports, Not Social Events**

If you're planning to start a successful campaign, you need to explain to your friends that you are not hosting a series of social events. You are starting an intramural sports team and asking them if they'd like to be on the team.

It's true that role-playing games are like social events in that some of the fun is socializing with your friends. But the problem with treating an RPG as a social event is that the etiquette of social events does not lend itself to RPGs at all. Consider the notion of “fashionably late” at a social event — where you demonstrate your social status by not bothering to show up until the event is already underway. Or consider the notion of “stopping by” a social event, where you put two or three events on the schedule and visit each one for only a portion of the time. Or even consider “blowing off” a social event, where you simply don’t attend because something better came up. You can throw a party for guests who behave that way, but you sure can’t run an RPG when the players are fashionably late, stopping by, or blowing it off.

That’s why you need to position joining the campaign as akin to joining a sports team. People can often have trouble understanding why they need to show up on time and stay through until the end at a social event, but everyone understands that the quarterback needs to show up at the football game and finish the game.

Moreover, many if not most people have been on an intramural sports team at one point in their life, and so it’s a simple analogy for them to understand and puts into perspective the time commitment. A player who balks at committing to your campaign as an intramural sport is almost certainly a player who will miss a lot of sessions. And that’s important, because missing sessions is one of the worst thing a player can do to a campaign.

### **Missing in Action**

Even with the most well-intentioned and dedicated players, there will be times when one or more of them can't make it. An ongoing challenge for every ***ACKS***Judge is what to do when one or more players go “missing in action.” On the web, you can find recommendations ranging from cancelling the game to running with the missing player’s characters killed and everything seen in between. Most of these recommendations are wrong.

The first thing to know is: Don’t cancel the game**. The game must go on.**As long as you have more than half of your group available (3 players out of 5, for instance), the game goes on. Pragmatically, in any regular weekly campaign, there will almost certainly be one or two absent players in any given session due to work, illness, travel, kids, etc. If you cancel whenever one or two people are missing, then you’ll be canceling more often than you are running. Philosophically, the campaign should be larger than any one player or any one faction of players. If you cancel because of someone else’s decision that they can’t or won’t come play, then you’ve handed over control of the destiny of your campaign to that person.

There’s no hard and fast rule about what you should do with the missing player’s characters. It will depend on the style of game you are running. If you’re running a collective group, then let the attending players run their friend’s PCs and give everyone full experience points, so they stay on the same advancement curve. If you’re running a competitive-collective group, then you should NPC the missing player characters, and award them a limited experience award. If you’re running an individualist group, then the missing player characters are absent pursuing other agendas (or present as NPCs if that’s impossible), and they should not get any experience.

These methods are what we use in practice and they work very well. For instance, in our weekly (collective) ACKS campaign, with 7 players, we play if there are 4 players available. The attending players run the missing player’s characters while they are away.

### **You Must Lead By Example**

None of the advice above will sustain a campaign alone. ***You*** must sustain it. As the Judge, you are the heart and soul of the group. If you show up late, you cannot expect the players to show up on time. If you do not put time in between sessions into prepping the game, you cannot expect the players to bother to remember what went on last session. If you cancel the game because you have a tummy ache, then you can’t expect your players to have any more commitment.

But if you do have the commitment, running a long-term campaign is one of the most satisfying experiences you can enjoy. It’s the sort of experience that the rules in this book are designed to create, and that we hope you’ll pursue with gusto.

# Chapter 2: Adventures

At its core, ***ACKS II***is a game of high adventure in which your player characters will explore dangerous and distant places, fated either to perish at the hands of terrible perils or to overcome the odds and return laden with treasure. A great adventure, one that takes advantage of the full breadth and depth of ***ACKS II***’s mechanics, will be a challenge to both the players and the Judge. The rules in this chapter will help you meet that challenge. They serve to supplement and expand the rules presented in Chapters 6 and 7 of the ***ACKS II Revised Rulebook***.

## Dungeon Delves

Dungeon delves are the primary focus of the early stages of most campaigns (1st – 3rd levels), and can remain an important type of gameplay all the way to the end of a campaign. The following rules are intended to assist you in running dungeon delves.

### Sequence of Play (Dungeon Delves)

Dungeon delves can be divided up into three stages: pre-delve, delve, and post-delve.

#### Pre-Delve Stage

Before entering the dungeon, the adventurers should:

1. Determine party marching order.
2. Select one or more mappers. A mapper requires bright light and becomes **vulnerable** while mapping.
3. Establish light sources. Torches and lanterns shed bright light in a 15’ radius and dim light out another 15’ beyond that.

#### Delve stage

Once a dungeon delve begins, gameplay is handled in increments of **turns**. Each turn, you should follow the procedure below:

1. Determine each adventurer’s action during the turn. Actions can be methodical (requiring a full turn) or hasty (requiring 1 round.
2. Roll to see if any random encounters are triggered by the party’s actions. If an encounter is triggered:
   1. Choose or roll 1d10 to determine the minute during the turn that the encounter occurs. This may affect the flow of later events.
   2. Roll on the Random Encounter table for the dungeon to determine the nature of the encounter.
   3. Follow the encounter procedure to determine encounter distance, monster reactions, and surprise.
   4. If the party engages in combat, shift play to rounds and follow the combat sequence.
3. Adjudicate the results of any attempts to batter down doors, pick locks, disarm traps, listen for noises, or other stationary dungeon activities.
4. Adjudicate the results of movement and determine if the party will encounter any traps in the dungeon. If so, then:
   1. Are any adventurers searching the area of the trap, either hastily as they move or methodically in a 10’ x 10’ area that includes the trap?
      1. If so, make a proficiency throw for each to see if the character detects the trap.
      2. If so, describe the trap trigger and allow them to update their actions during the remainder of the turn.
   2. Are any adventurers using 10’ poles to probe ahead of the party’s formation?
      1. If so, roll to see if the pole triggers the trap.
      2. Adjudicate the results of the trap if triggered.
   3. Are any adventurers taking actions that might trigger the trap?
      1. If so, roll for each (usually in marching order) to see if each triggers the trap.
      2. Adjudicate the results of the trap if triggered.
5. Determine if there will be any deliberate encounters triggered by the party’s actions. If a deliberate encounter is triggered:
   1. Choose or roll 1d10 to determine the minute during the turn that the encounter occurs.
   2. Follow the encounter procedure to determine encounter distance, monster reactions, and surprise.
   3. If the party engages in combat, shift play to rounds and follow the combat sequence.
6. Mark off 1 turn (10 minutes) of game time.
   1. Check to see if any spell durations expire.
   2. Check to see if the adventurers need to rest. (After 5 turns, all adventurers must rest for 1 turn.)
   3. Check to see if any lit torches or lanterns go out. (A torch burns out in 6 turns, a lantern for 24 turns.)

Throughout this process, you should be describing what the adventurers see, hear, smell, and feel at each step. It’s your job to make the dungeon, in all its splendor and horror, come alive for them.

Do not feel strictly beholden to this sequence. Sometimes, to adjudicate the action, you’ll need to segment each turn into 10 rounds, during which the adventurers advance at 1/10th exploration speed per round. Sometimes they’ll trigger an encounter before a trap, or they’ll decide to backtrack partway through the turn based on the results of other actions. You should segment or re-order the steps as necessary to maintain the flow of the game. The sequence of a play is intended to be applied by a live Judge using common sense.

#### Post-Delve stage

When a dungeon delve ends, it’s a good idea to do some bookkeeping.

1. Write down the names of the adventurers who participated in the delve and make note of any **curses**, permanent wounds, or other effects that they suffered.
2. Write down any treasure recovered and monsters slain by the party. When the party returns to civilization, this will determine their adventuring XP.

### Encounters in the Dungeon

Monsters often live in the tunnels, caves, and chambers of dungeons. However, monsters do not only stay where they live. They also wander, hunt, and explore. Indeed, some monsters never stop moving long enough to make a lair at all. Such creatures are called **wandering monsters**, and they can represent a dire threat to adventures, who may suffer **random encounters** with them while exploring.

When the characters are in a dungeon, you should make an encounter throw of 1d6 every 2 turns. An encounter throw of 6+ indicates a random encounter with wandering monsters. When an encounter occurs with wandering monsters in the dungeon, follow these steps:

1. Find the row of the **Dungeon Random Encounters** table that shows the dungeon level on which the monster has been encountered. Roll 1d12 and read across to find the column specifying which Monster Level column will be used to generate the monster.
2. Roll 1d12 on the resulting **Wandering Monsters by Level** table to determine the type of creature encountered. You can use the default table provided on the following page, or create your own. For information on designing your own random encounter tables, see Chapter 8, **Dungeons** (p. XX – p. XX).
3. Roll the appropriate **number encountered** for the creature to determine how many are present. Increase or decrease this roll by 50% for each step of difference between the dungeon level and the Monster Level column used (round up). For example, imagine that the adventurers are on Dungeon Level 1 but have had the misfortune to have a random encounter with a Level 3 monster — 1d6 wights. The roll is a 4. Since there are two steps of difference, 4 x 0.5 x 0.5 = 1. Only 1 wight is encountered on Dungeon Level 1. On the other hand, the same monster and roll (4 wights), if encountered on Dungeon Level 5, would yield 4 x 1.5 x 1.5 = 9 wights.
4. Determine the **encounter distance**. Start by rolling 2d6 x 10 to determine the maximum encounter distance in feet at the start of the encounter. Then choose or randomly roll for the direction from which the monsters approach. Be sure to take into account the dungeon layout and known placement of other monsters to determine the direction from which the wandering monsters are approaching. Reduce the distance (using your dungeon map as a guide) until either the monster(s) can see the adventurers or the adventurers’ light source, or the adventurers can see the monster(s) or their light source (if any).
5. Roll for surprise and reactions as described in the ***ACKS II Revised Rulebook*** and this book (p. XX). Modify the reaction roll by the difference between the Random Monster table used and the dungeon level of the encounter. For instance, if the wights (Level 3 monsters) are encountered on Dungeon level 5, they have a -2 penalty to reaction rolls; if encountered on level 1, they have a +2 bonus to reaction rolls. The numerical superiority of monsters traveling deeper into the dungeon makes them more likely to attack. On the other hand, powerful monsters wandering on an upper level are more inclined to view the party as tools than threats.

At your discretion, you can change both or either the frequency and/or the target value of the encounter throw. For instance, if a dungeon has regular patrols every 30 minutes but few wandering monsters in between, you could make an encounter throw every 3 turns with a target value of 4+ representing encountering a patrol.

The concept of dungeon level is inherited from the earliest days of tabletop gaming, when huge multi-level megadungeons dominated campaigns. Outside of a megadungeon context, dungeon level need not be interpreted literally. A dungeon might be just one level but if it is a very dangerous or deadly dungeon, it might count as Dungeon Level 6. For information on designing your own dungeons and creating your own dungeon random encounters, see Chapter 8: **Dungeons** (p. XX – p. XX).

## Wilderness Expeditions

When your player characters have explored the dungeons near their starting location, they will begin to journey into the wilderness in search of further adventure. Wilderness adventurers are most common at mid-levels (3rd – 7th level), but the rules that follow can be used anytime the player characters venture into the wilds.

### Sequence of Play (Wilderness Expeditions)

When a wilderness expedition begins, gameplay is handled in increments of **game days** and **hours**. Each game day, the adventurers can undertake 1 dedicated activity (8 hours) and 4 ancillary activities (1 hour each).

1. **Determine Weather:** Determine the weather for the day (p. XX). If weather conditions are Frigid, Foggy, Muddy, Snowy, or Sweltering, expedition speed will be halved. If weather conditions are Flurry, Foggy, Rainy, Snowy, Sunbaked, Stormy, or Windy, penalties might apply to certain activities. Effects of multiple conditions are cumulative (***ACKS II RR****,* p. XX).
2. **Check for Starvation and Dehydration:** Check to see if any creatures on the expedition are starving or dehydrated. If so, starving creatures lose 1 CON and dehydrated creatures lose 1d6 CON (or 2d6 CON if weather conditions are Sweltering).
3. **Determine Activities:** Ask the party what dedicated and/or ancillary activities it plans to undertake. Determine marching order.
4. **Check for Daily Encounters:** If the party will be hunting or resting in unsettled territory, roll to see if any random encounters will occur that day. If a random encounter will occur, roll 1d12 to determine the hour of its occurrence.
5. **Check if the Party Gets Lost:** If the party will be traveling, check to see if the party avoids getting lost (***ACKS II RR***, p. XX). If it gets lost, determine the direction they will erroneously be traveling today.
6. **Adjudicate Each Hour:** For each of the 12 adventuring hours in the day, follow the steps below.
   1. *Check for Scheduled Encounter:* If a random encounter is scheduled to occur this hour, follow the encounter procedure (described below).
   2. *Adjudicate Special Activities:* If the party is undertaking any activities this hour other than hunting, foraging, traveling, resting, or searching, adjudicate them now.
   3. *Adjudicate Travel and Encounters:* If the party is traveling, adjust its position on your wilderness map based on one hour of travel in the appropriate direction. If this causes the party to enter a new hex, roll to see if a random encounter occurs. If an encounter occurs, follow the encounter procedure (below).
   4. *Adjudicate Searching:* If any adventurers in the party are searching a hex, roll to see if a random encounter occurs. If an encounter occurs, follow the encounter procedure (below). After the encounter (if any), is resolved, roll to see if their search finds any lairs.
   5. *Adjudicate Weather Effects.* If weather conditions are Frigid, check to see if any creature becomes hypothermic either from cold water or lack of protective clothing. Each hypothermic creature loses 1d3 CON now. If weather conditions are Sweltering, check to see if any creatures in heavy armor become fatigued now.
7. **Resolve Foraging and Hunting:** If any adventurers in the party foraged or hunted at any time during the day, roll to see if they found food, water, or firewood. If so, add the food and water to their available supplies of rations, and the firewood to their supplies.
8. **Consume Rations:** Mark off no, half, or full food ration and no, half, or full water ration for each creature on the expedition.
   1. If any underfed creature eats a full ration of food, the condition ends.
   2. If any starving creature eats a full ration of food, the condition ends and the creature becomes underfed.
   3. If any dehydrated creature drinks a full ration of water, the condition ends.
   4. If any creature has gone 2 consecutive days without food, or 5 consecutive days with an average of half rations, it becomes underfed.
   5. If any creature has been underfed for 5 days with no food, or for 10 days with an average of half rations, it becomes starving. If any creature has gone a day without water, or 2 days with an average of half water, it becomes dehydrated.
9. **Adjudicate Weather Effects:** Follow the steps below to resolve any additional weather effects.
   1. *Disease:* If any creature has suffered seven consecutive days of Frigid or Rainy weather, check to see if it catches a disease (10% chance). If so, resolve the disease using the rules on p. XX.
   2. *Hypothermia:* If any creature on the expedition was hypothermic or suffered cold damage in Frigid temperatures, check to see if they suffer Frostbite. If so, resolve its effects.
   3. *Mud:* If conditions were Drizzly for three consecutive days or Rainy today, grasslands and scrublands terrain become Muddy. If conditions were Cold, Frigid, or Sweltering today, or Moderate for seven days, the mud dries.
   4. *Snow:* If conditions were Flurry for three consecutive days or Snowy today, terrain becomes Snowy. If conditions were Sweltering today, or Moderate for the past seven days, the snow melts.
   5. *Sunburn:* If conditions were Sunbaked today, creatures that lacked protective clothing take 1 fire damage.
10. **Adjudicate Fatigue**: Check to see if any creatures on the expedition has undertaken six consecutive days of strenuous activity (or the equivalent thereof by force marching). If so, it becomes fatigued (***ACKS II*** *RR,* p. XX).
11. **Adjudicate Healing**: If any characters rested, they heal 1d3 hit points, or 2d3 hit points if under the care of a healer.
12. **Check for Nighttime Encounters**: If resting at night in Borderlands, Outland, or Unsettled territory, roll to see if any random encounters will occur that night. If a random encounter will occur, roll 1d12 to determine the hour of its occurrence and resolve it at that time.
13. **Advance Calendar:** Mark off 1 day of game time.

Do not feel strictly beholden to this sequence. Sometimes, to adjudicate the action, you’ll need to adjust the sequence of events, other times disregard it altogether. The sequence of play is just intended as a checklist, not a mandate from heaven.

### Weathering the Wilderness

The ***ACKS II******Revised Rulebook***presents a number of game mechanics related to weather, including various conditions (hot, cold, rainy, windy, etc.) and effects (hypothermia, frostbite, dehydration, etc.). What it does not provide are rules to generate the weather each day.

#### Weather Table

At the start of each game day of a wilderness expedition, you can determine the weather for the adventurers’ current 24-mile hex with three rolls of 2d6: a **temperature roll**, a **precipitation roll**, and a **wind roll**. Each roll is adjusted by a modifier between -11 and +9 depending on the climate of the hex. After making the roll, use the Daily Weather table below to determine the prevailing weather for the day. If the prevailing weather is **bold**, it affects gameplay as detailed in ***ACKS II******Revised Rulebook***. Otherwise, the prevailing weather has utility only in affecting your narration and, sometimes, adjusting what another condition means.

**Day/Night Cycle:** In most climates, the temperature modifier will be 1 or more points lower during the night. Keep the same roll you made for the day temperature and simply apply the new modifier, or you can re-roll.

**Fast Travel:** If the adventurers move at a speed that will carry them through two or more 24-mile hexes each day, you can either use the same roll or re-roll. If the hexes have the same climate, we recommend keeping the same roll, but if the climate has changed (e.g. the adventurers have moved into the rain shadow of a mountain) then re-roll.

**Precipitation:** If the Temperature is Cold or Frigid, then Drizzly precipitation creates Flurry conditions and Rainy precipitation creates **Snowy** conditions (which do). If the Wind is Still, then Drizzly precipitation creates Misty conditions (which have no game effect) and Rainy precipitation creates **Foggy** conditions (which do).

**Temperature:** If the daytime temperature modifier is +0 or less, use the first column of the table to determine the temperature for both day and night. If the daytime temperature modifier is +1 or more, use the second column.

|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Modifier** | **Temperature (+0 or less)** | **Temperature (+1 or more)** | **Precipitation** | **Wind** |
| **-7 or less** | **Frigid** (-75 F or less) | - | **Sunbaked** | Still |
| **-6** | **Frigid** (-65 to -74 F) | - | **Sunbaked** | Still |
| **-5** | **Frigid** (-55 to -64 F) | - | **Sunbaked** | Still |
| **-4** | **Frigid** (-50 to -54 F) | - | **Sunbaked** | Still |
| **-3** | **Frigid** (-40 to -49 F) | - | **Sunbaked** | Still |
| **-2** | **Frigid** (-25 to -39 F) | - | **Sunbaked** | Still |
| **-1** | **Frigid** (-12 to -24 F) | - | Clear | Still |
| **0** | **Frigid** (-6 to -11 F) | Very Chilly (33 to 36 F) | Clear | Still |
| **1** | **Frigid** (-5 to 0 F) | Very Chilly (37 to 40 F) | Clear | Still |
| **2** | **Cold** (6 to 15 F) | Chilly (41 to 50 F) | Clear | Still |
| **3** | **Cold** (16 to 25 F) | Chilly (51 to 56 F) | Clear | Still |
| **4** | **Cold** (26 to 32 F) | Chilly (57 to 62 F) | Partly Cloudy | Still |
| **5** | Very Chilly (33 to 36 F) | Brisk (63 to 67 F) | Mostly Cloudy | Gentle |
| **6** | Very Chilly (37 to 40 F) | Balmy (68 to 71 F) | Overcast | Gentle |
| **7** | Chilly (41 to 50 F) | Balmy (72 to 74 F) | **Drizzly** | Moderate |
| **8** | Chilly (51 to 55 F) | Balmy (75 to 79 F) | **Drizzly** | Moderate |
| **9** | Brisk (56 to 60 F) | Warm (80 to 82 F) | **Drizzly** | Moderate |
| **10** | Brisk (61 to 65 F) | Warm (83 to 86 F) | **Rainy** | Strong |
| **11** | Balmy (66 to 68 F) | Hot (87 to 90 F) | **Rainy** | Strong |
| **12** | Balmy (69 to 72 F) | Hot (91 to 94 F) | **Rainy** | Very Strong, **Windy** |
| **13** | - | **Sweltering** (95 to 99 F) | **Rainy** | Very Strong, **Windy** |
| **14** | - | **Sweltering** (100 to 104 F) | **Rainy** | Gale, **Stormy** |
| **15** | - | **Sweltering** (105 to 108 F) | **Rainy** | Gale, **Stormy** |
| **16** | - | **Sweltering** (109 to 112 F) | **Rainy** | Gale, **Stormy** |
| **17** | - | **Sweltering** (113 to 115 F) | **Rainy** | Gale, **Stormy** |
| **18** | - | **Sweltering** (116 to 120 F) | **Rainy** | Gale, **Stormy** |
| **19 or more** | - | **Sweltering** (121 F or more) | **Rainy** | Gale, **Stormy** |

#### Determining Weather Modifiers

The temperature, precipitation, and wind modifiers are determined by the season of the year cross-referenced against the climate of the region. Each climate is assigned a two- or three-digit climate code based on the Köppen Climate Classification system. If you are a worldbuilder by hobby, you’ll probably have worked out the climate for your entire continent and region. If not, you can use the Climate by Terrain table to decide which climate code to use based on how you’ve imagined the setting.

**Continental vs Temperate:** These climates are similar in that both occur at middle latitudes and both have four distinct seasons. However, continental climates occur in the interior of continents at middle latitudes, while temperate climates occur on the coasts of continents at middle latitudes.

EXAMPLE: It is spring in the Borderlands of Southern Argollë and the adventurers are just beginning a wilderness expedition. The Judge rolls for weather. The Borderlands has a Cfa climate, so the temperature modifier is +2 (day) and +0 (night); the Precipitation modifier is -2; and the wind modifier is 0.

First, the Judge rolls 2d6 for temperature and gets a 5. Since the daytime temperature modifier is +2, he consults the second column of the Daily Weather table, where a modified 7 results in Balmy temperatures of 72 to 74 F. The nighttime temperature modifier is +0, so he consults the first column of the Daily Weather table for the temperatures that night; with a result of 5, the night cools to Brisk (63 to 67 F).

Next the Judge rolls 2d6 for precipitation and gets an 11. This is modified to a 9 by the -2 precipitation modifier. Consulting the Daily Weather table, he sees that the precipitation is Drizzly.

Finally, the Judge rolls 2d6 for wind and gets a 4. Since the wind modifier is 0, the result is unmodified. Consulting the Daily Weather table, he sees that the wind is Still. Since the wind is Still, the Drizzly precipitation becomes Misty instead.

The Judge interprets these results contextually to mean that it’s a warm and hazy spring day that cools by nightfall with a frosty mist.

### Encounters in the Wilderness

When the characters are on an expedition in civilized, borderlands, outlands, or unsettled terrain they face the risk of wilderness encounters. Characters in urban settlements do not risk wilderness encounters but might face settlement encounters (p. XX).

#### Frequency of Encounter Throws

The frequency of wilderness encounter throws is determined by the activities of the characters and the classification of the terrain they occupy.

|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Activity** | **Civilized** | **Borderlands** | **Outlands** | **Unsettled** |
| Hunting | Once per attempt | Once per attempt | Once per attempt | Once per attempt |
| Managing Traps | None | None | Once per 6 traps | Once per 6 traps |
| Resting/Stationary (day) | None | None | None | Once per 12 hours |
| Resting/Stationary (night) | Once per 7 nights | Once per 3 nights | Once per 12 hours | Once per 12 hours |
| Searching | Once per hour | Once per hour | Once per hour | Once per hour |
| Traveling | Once per 6-mile hex | Once per 6-mile hex | Once per 6-mile hex | Once per 6-mile hex |

Encounter throws triggered by time are made when the time period begins. If an encounter is triggered, you can choose when it occurs or roll dice to randomly determine when with the week, day, night, and hour the encounter occurs. The following are the recommended rules from the Sequence of Campaign Play (p. XX):

* Roll 1d8 to determine the day of the week (re-rolling or choosing on an 8).
* Roll 1d12 to determine the hour of the day or night, counting from dawn and dusk respectively.
* Roll 1d6 to determine the turn of the hour.

Encounter throws triggered by hexes are made when the characters enter the hex. If an encounter is triggered, you can choose where it occurs or roll 1d6 to determine the number of miles into the hex that the encounter occurs.

#### Making Wilderness Encounter Throws

To make a wilderness encounter throw, follow these steps:

1. Roll 1d20 on the appropriate column of the Wilderness Encounters by Territory Classification table.
2. If the roll indicates a “Column Shift, Roll Again” result, shift one column right on the Wilderness Encounters by Territory Classifications table and roll again.
3. If the roll indicates a “No Encounter” result, there is no encounter.
4. If the roll indicates a “Civilized Encounter” result, roll 1d100 on the Civilized Encounter by Terrain Type table to find the type of creature encountered.
5. If the roll indicates a “Monster Encounter” result:
   1. Roll 1d20 on the Monster Rarity by Territory Classification table and consult the resulting sub-table for the terrain type.
   2. Roll 1d100 on the appropriate Monster Encounter by Terrain Type and Rarity to find the type of creature encountered.
6. If creatures have been encountered in steps 4 or 5:
   1. Find the encountered creature’s entry in the ***ACKS II******Monstrous Manual***and roll against its **Lair** characteristic to determine whether the creature is in its lair. (If the creature is in its lair, a **dynamic lair** can be used if one is available).
   2. Roll the appropriate **number encountered** for the creature to determine how many are present.
   3. Roll on the Wilderness Encounter Distance table to randomly determine the maximum encounter distance in feet at the start of the encounter. The encounter will then occur at either the maximum encounter distance or the maximum visibility distance (p. XX), whichever is less. If the creature is in its lair, the encounter distance is the distance to the lair. If the creature is outside its lair, the encounter distance is the distance to the creature.
   4. Check for surprise and evasion, where necessary, and then proceed to reactions or combat.
7. If the roll indicates a “Terrain Encounter” result, treat it as a result of “No Encounter” if the party is resting/stationary or have specified they are following a specific route they have already traversed. Otherwise, roll 1d12 on the appropriate Terrain Encounter sub-table to determine the type of terrain encountered.

The results of rolls on the Wilderness Counter tables and sub-tables should always be handled in a fashion that makes sense in the context of the terrain, weather, time of year, and other factors. If necessary to maintain the verisimilitude of the setting, disregard the result and roll again.

#### Wilderness Encounter by Territory Classification

|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | **Civilized + Road** | **Civilized or**  **Borderlands + Road** | **Borderlands or**  **Outlands + Road** | **Outlands or**  **Unsettled + Road** | **Unsettled** |
| Column Shift, Roll Again | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | **-** |
| No Encounter | 2 - 11 | 2 – 10 | 2 – 8 | 2 – 8 | 1 – 6 |
| Civilized Encounter | 12 – 20 | 11 – 17 | 9 – 13 | 9 – 11 | - |
| Monster Encounter | - | 18 | 14 – 15 | 12 – 15 | 7 – 12 |
| Dangerous Terrain Encounter | - | 19 | 16 – 17 | 16 – 17 | 13 – 15 |
| Valuable Terrain Encounter | - | 20 | 18 – 19 | 18 – 19 | 16 – 18 |
| Unique Terrain Encounter | - | - | 20 | 20 | 19 – 20 |

Roll 1d20 on the appropriate column of the Wilderness Encounters by Territory Classification table. If the party is traveling along a road or a navigable river, be sure to use the “+ Road” column for the territory class. If the party is traveling at night in civilized, borderlands, our outlands territory, shift one column to the right.

**Designer’s Note:** When the adventurers are “hex crawling,” you will be making one encounter throw per hex they enter. In such cases, it often makes sense to pre-determine the results of a number of encounter throws before the session and put them into a numbered sequence. As the adventurers travel across the hexes and trigger encounter throws, you can just check off an encounter throw from your sequence. We use this method in our home games to speed play!

#### Civilized Encounters

Civilized encounters can confront the adventurers with domesticated animals, local residents, travelers, and even the occasional disguised monster. Roll 1d100 on the Civilized Encounter by Terrain Type table to find the type of creature encountered.

#### Monster Encounters

Monster encounters can confront the party with anything from a hungry black bear to an ancient dragon on the hunt. The farther the party travels from civilization, the more likely the party is to face rare and dangerous monsters.

###### Monster Rarity by Terrain Classification

Roll 1d20 and cross-reference the result with the territory classification on the Monster Rarity by Terrain Classification table. After determining whether the monster encountered is common, uncommon, rare, or very rare, proceed to the appropriate Monster Encounter by Terrain Type and Rarity sub-table.

|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Dice Roll (d20)** | **Civilized** | **Borderlands** | **Outlands** | **Unsettled** |
| Common | 1-14 | 1-12 | 1-10 | 1-8 |
| Uncommon | 15-19 | 13-18 | 11-15 | 9-14 |
| Rare | 20 | 19-20 | 16-19 | 15-18 |
| Very Rare | - | - | 20 | 19-20 |

###### Monster Encounters by Terrain Type and Rarity

Some monsters are common in every type of terrain. Others are common in some types of terrain but rare in others. The most powerful monsters tend to be rare or very rare even in their preferred terrain. Roll 1d20 and cross-reference the result with the terrain type on the appropriate Monster Encounter by Terrain Type and Rarity table. Note that in some cases, there are sub-types of terrain that reflect different weather biomes.

An \* indicates that the creature is a cosmetic replacement for one found in the ***ACKS II******Monstrous Manual*** meant to better reflect the species and sub-species common in this region:

* The locust, mosquito, and tsetse fly swarm are types of insect swarms.
* The quelea swarm has the characteristics of the bat swarm. (The quelea is a rapacious bird with a red bill.)

\*The Swamp encounter table is inspired by the Nile Delta and Mesopotamian Marsh. In the Auran Empire, the wetlands of Aurëpos are Swamp terrain. The names in parentheses specify the specific species of certain animals. An \* indicates that the creature is a cosmetic replacement for one found in the ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual***, meant to better reflect the species and sub-species common in this region:

* The forest cobra has the characteristics of the spitting cobra.
* The green mamba has the characteristics of the king cobra.

#### Terrain Encounters

While monster encounters put the adventurers face to face with dangerous monsters, terrain encounters present an altogether different sort of challenge. Adventurers might discover places of great natural beauty, be confronted by ancient mysteries, come upon horrible scenes of destruction, or even encounter terrain so difficult to traverse they are forced to turn back.

There are three types of terrain encounters – valuable, dangerous, and unique. The type of terrain encounter that confronts the characters is determined by the result of the encounter throw. Remember, terrain encounters do not occur if the party is resting/stationary or have specified they are following a specific route they have already traversed.

###### Treasure Types

When any sub-table result directs a roll for Treasure Type by Terrain, roll using the treasure type indicated by this table.

###### Valuable Terrain Encounters

| **Valuable Terrain (1d12)** | |
| **1** | Cache |
| **2** | Food |
| **3** | Fountain |
| **4** | Hidden Settlement |
| **5** | Monster Carcass |
| **6** | Ore |
| **7** | Ruin |
| **8** | Safe Haven |
| **9** | Shortcut |
| **10** | Useful Herbs |
| **11** | Vista |
| **12** | Double |

**Cache:** The adventurers find a hidden stash of loot or other unguarded treasure. Roll for treasure as per the Treasure Type by Terrain table. You can substitute special treasures for some or all of the treasure if desired, in order to place caches of resources rather than coin.

**Food:** The adventurers find an easily-accessible source of food; perhaps the adventurers found a fruit grove, a deer leapt across their path, or they stumbled upon a patch of delicious mushrooms. Regardless of the source, it offers the party 4d10 x 2 pounds of standard rations. Remember that 2 pounds of rations are sufficient to feed one person for one day. One week of rations weighs 1 stone.

**Fountain:** The adventurers discover a source of fresh potable water such as a lagoon, pond, spring, stream, or oasis. Regardless of the source, the fountain can provide 50 gallons of water each day, enough for one platoon of 15 cavalry and mounts or one company of 120 infantry to stay hydrated for one day. Replenishing from the fountain is an incidental activity (e.g. it takes less than a turn).

**Hidden Settlement:** The adventurers find a concealed lair of nonbelligerent creatures. Roll on the Monster Encounter table for the terrain to discover what type of creatures live there. Regardless of the result, the creatures will not be actively hostile. (If they are unintelligent, they may simply not mind the party's presence; if they are Chaotic, they may be hiding and just want to be left alone. The details of why this particular group is not actively hostile are left to you to decide.) A hidden settlement of intelligent creatures may be treated as a Class VI market with only half the normal number of items available (rounded up).

**Monster Carcass:** The adventurers find a dead monster or monsters. Roll on the Monster Encounter table for the terrain to determine the type of creature(s). The adventurers find the result rolled dead in their path. The corpse’s age in days is 1d4 divided by the terrain movement modifier for the hex. For example, in a desert (x2/3), it is from 1.5 to 6 days old, while on a road (x3/2), it is from 16 hours to 2.5 days old. The monster will have salvageable parts as per ***ACKS Lairs & Encounters*** *or* ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual***.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **1d100** | **Ore** |
| 01-35 | Stone |
| 36-75 | Iron |
| 76-95 | Copper |
| 96-97 | Silver-lead |
| 98-99 | Gemstone |
| 100 | Gold |

**Ore:** The adventurers stumble upon a visible deposit of ore. Roll on the table below to determine the type of ore they’ve discovered. Characters proficient in Land Surveying or Prospecting can automatically identify the ore for what it is on sight. Other characters must stop for 6 turns (1 hour) to investigate the site and succeed on an Adventuring proficiency throw of 18+ to identify the ore. This ore can be mined using the rules in ***By This Ax****e* or ***Axioms Compendium 9-16****.* If you’re not using those rules, then the deposit increases the land value of the hex by +1 if it contains stone, iron, copper, or silver-lead (to a minimum of 5), and by +2 if it contains gemstones or gold (to a minimum of 7).

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Terrain** | **Modifier** |
| Clear, Grass, Scrub | 0 |
| Hills, Mountains, Woods, River | +2 |
| Jungle, Swamp, Ocean, Desert, Barren | +4 |

**Ruin:** The adventurers find an abandoned, unoccupied structure of some kind. Roll 1d20 on the Structure Type table. The structure is damaged, but could be repaired. To find the ruin’s value, roll 1d12 and add a modifier as indicated by terrain type.

The ruin has an initial value of 39,000 gp plus another 2,000 gp times the result of your roll. Of course, these ruins are not in pristine shape; they wouldn't be ruins if they were! The more wild and less settled the terrain, the more likely the ruin is to be horrifically decayed. Roll 2d10 and subtract twice the terrain modifier listed above to determine what percentage of the ruin's value has survived, to a minimum of 1%. At your discretion, round this value to the nearest 5%.

EXAMPLE: The adventurers have discovered a ruin in a swamp hex. The Judge rolls 16 on the Structure table, so the ruin is a temple. To determine the temple’s initial value, the Judge rolls a 3 on 1d12, and adds +4 because the temple is in a swamp, for a result of 7. Therefore the temple’s initial value was 39,000 + (2,000gp x 7) = 53,000 gp. The Judge then rolls to determine the percentage of value remaining. He rolls a 13, so the temple retains [13 – (2 x 4)] 5% of its original value. The ruined temple is worth 2,650gp.

**Safe Haven:** The adventurers find a hidden, guarded, or otherwise especially safe location. While resting here, the adventurers will not be discovered by any random encounters, though the adventurers may be followed into the safe haven if they attempt to escape into it. Choose or roll 1d10 on the Safe Haven table to determine the nature of the haven.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Safe Haven (1d10)** | |
| **1** | A talus cave on a rocky slope. |
| **2** | A forested dell hidden by fells that flank it on either side. |
| **3** | A rocky ledge inaccessible except by one easily-guarded route. |
| **4** | A meadow surrounded by a nigh-impenetrable thicket of thorny briar. |
| **5** | A clearing concealed by a dense grove of trees. |
| **6** | A deep gully with high sides. |
| **7** | A narrow crevice with rocky overhangs. |
| **8** | An abandoned cabin, hut, or tree house. |
| **9** | An abandoned warren with underground tunnels dug by giant varmints. |
| **10** | A limestone cave with a grotto. |

**Shortcut:** The adventurers find a shortcut. Draw a line from the face of the hex the adventurers entered from, to the face of the hex the adventurers leave through, along the direction of their travel. When traveling between these faces, the adventurers may treat the hex as having no modifier to travel speed. If the hex's terrain already gave no modifier, the adventurers may treat it as a road instead. (At your discretion, to simplify, these effects can be applied when the adventurers travel through the hex in any direction instead of only along their original axis of travel.)

| **Useful Herbs (1d12)** | |
| **1** | Belladonna |
| **2** | Birthwort |
| **3** | Comfrey |
| **4** | Garlic |
| **5** | Goldenrod |
| **6** | Wolfsbane |
| **7** | Woundwort |
| **8** | Aloe |
| **9** | Bitterwood |
| **10** | Horsetail |
| **11** | Lungwort |
| **12** | Willow-bark |

**Useful Herbs:** The adventurers happen upon a field where healing herbs grow. Roll on the useful herbs table, below, to determine what the adventurers found. A character with Naturalism proficiency (or another appropriate proficiency) can identify the find with a proficiency throw of 11+. If correctly identified, the herbs can be harvested. There will be 2d100 lbs of herbs. Harvesting the herbs takes 1 turn per 5 lbs. (Harvesting 180 lbs of herbs counts as a dedicated strenuous activity, e.g. 180 lbs in 6 hours.) Each pound counts as one item for encumbrance purposes.

**Vista:** The adventurers find a place with a fantastic view of the surrounding terrain. Maximum visibility distance and encounter distance are doubled from the vista. In addition to being an exemplar of natural beauty, suitable for construction of an elven fastness, it offers an excellent strategic command post. If an army occupies the vista it gains a +1 bonus on reconnaissance rolls. If the army fights a battle while defending the vista, each commander in the army gains a bonus of 1d3 points to their Strategic Ability.

**Double:** Roll twice on this table. If either or both rolls are 'double', again, roll on the Unique Terrain table instead. If neither reroll is 'double', the adventurers find both indicated valuable terrain pieces. (The adventurers cannot find one Unique and one Valuable. For instance, if the rerolls are 12 and 3, you find only a piece of unique terrain, not a piece of unique terrain and a cache.)

###### Dangerous Terrain Encounters

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Dangerous Terrain (1d12)** | |
| **1** | Awful Despoiling |
| **2** | Challenge |
| **3** | Enshrouding Terrain |
| **4** | Foul Fountain |
| **5** | Hazard |
| **6** | Plague |
| **7** | Poison |
| **8** | Rough Going |
| **9** | Spoilage |
| **10** | Trap |
| **11** | Wasteland |
| **12** | Double |

**Awful Despoiling:** Roll once on the Valuable Terrain table. The adventurers find that result, but despoiled, desecrated, or otherwise destroyed. It’s up to you to decide what despoiled the terrain based on e.g. nearby monster lairs or other points of interest. A thorough search of the despoiled area requires 6 turns (one hour) and might reveal clues as to its cause on a successful Searching proficiency throw. However, the scene is so terrible that requesting hirelings to enter the despoiled area requires a Hireling Obedience roll.

**Challenge:** The adventurers run across a natural obstacle that challenges their adventuring skills. Choose or roll on the Challenge Type table to determine the nature of the challenge. The obstacles listed for each challenge are just examples; you should decide the exact nature of the obstacle based on the terrain, weather, and other circumstances.

The challenges posed by terrain encounters can be met by using the rules for balancing, climbing, crawling, rappelling, or squeezing in the ***ACKS II******Revised Rulebook*** or by other means (magical or mundane) that the players might devise. If the adventurers want to bypass the challenge, roll 1d12. On 1-8, it takes that many hours of backtracking to find a bypass. On a 9-10 there is no way to bypass the obstacle in this hex. In either case, roll for another encounter throw.

EXAMPLE: A party has been moving through the Jutting Mountains in winter. They have just entered a mountains hex when an obstacle is rolled. The Judge rolls 1d10 an gets a 3, indicating an easy climb of 1d6! x 100’ height. He rolls a 3, indicating 300’. The Judge decides that the mountain trail the party has been following has been blocked by a 300’ tall avalanche, forming a mound of slush, snow, and rock they have to scramble up.

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Challenge Type** | | |  |
| **Die Roll** | **Challenge** | **Example Obstacle** | **Dimensions** |
| 1 | Balancing Traverse (narrow) | Broken rope-bridge across ravine | 1d4+4” width, 1d6! x 100’ length, 1d6! x 100’ high |
| 2 | Balancing Traverse (precarious) | Precarious ledge along a cliff face | 1d4/2” width, 1d6 x 100’ length, 1d6! x 100’ high |
| 3 | Climbing (easy) | Rocky, scrambling ascent up a hill | 1d6! x 100’ height |
| 4 | Climbing (sheer) | Sheer ascent of cliff or mountain | 1d6! x 100’ height |
| 5 | Crawling Traverse | Chasm, gap, or ravine | 1d6! x 100’ height |
| 6 | Crawling Traverse or Jumping | Boulders over lava | 1d10 platforms, 3d10’ diameter, 3d10’ apart |
| 7 | Climbing (easy) or Rappeling | Scrambling descent down slope | 1d6! x 100’ height |
| 8 | Climbing (sheer) or Rappeling | Sheer descent down cliff | 1d6! x 100’ length |
| 9 | Squeezing | Crevice, fissure, or slot canyon | 1d2’ width, 1d6! x 40’ length |
| 10 | Swimming or Crawling Traverse | Unfordable waters | 1d6! x 40’ width, -1d3 penalty to Swimming throws |

**Enshrouding Terrain:** The adventurers enter terrain that makes it very difficult to see what is going on, such as a deep valley surrounded on all sides by forest. Maximum visibility distance and encounter distance are halved within the enshrouding terrain. If an army occupies the enshrouding terrain, it suffers a -1 penalty to its reconnaissance rolls; conversely, opposing armies suffer a -1 penalty to reconnaissance rolls to detect it. If an army is engaged in a battle within the enshrouding terrain, it has trouble controlling its troops. Each commander in such an army suffers a 1d3 point penalty to their Strategic Ability and Leadership Ability. The penalties can be identical or different (at your discretion).

**Foul Fountain:** The adventurers discover a source of fresh water such as a lagoon, pond, spring, stream, or oasis. Regardless of the source, the fountain can provide 50 gallons of water, enough for one platoon of 15 cavalry and mounts or one company of 120 infantry to stay hydrated for one day. Replenishing from the fountain is an incidental activity (e.g. it takes less than a turn). However, the water is foul and unsafe. Characters who drink the water without taking appropriate precautions (such as boiling it or casting *purify food and water*)become **incapacitated** 1d6 hours later with upset bowels, dysentery, and vomiting. The condition lasts one day, at the end of which the character becomes **dehydrated**. There is a 10% chance a character drinking foul water is affected by a disease (see Plague, below).

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Hazard Type** | | |
| **Die Roll** | **Hazard** | **Trap Equivalent** |
| 1 | Avalanche/Rockslide | Rolling Rock Trap |
| 2 | Brittle Ledges | Rock-Cut Pit Trap |
| 3 | Falling Rocks | Ceiling Collapse Trap |
| 4 | Hot Geysers/Vents | Fire Trap |
| 5 | Hidden Crevices/Sinkholes | Excavated Earth Pit |
| 6 | Rotten Collapse-Prone Trees | Swinging Log Trap |

**Hazard:** The adventurers arrive at a place of hidden danger. The hazard is the equivalent of a 5th level dungeon trap (see p. XX), albeit of natural rather than mechanical nature. To determine the nature of the hazard, roll 1d6 on the Hazard Type table; alternatively devise your own! If any adventurers in the party are proficient in Land Surveying, roll to see if they hastily detect the hazard. If not, then roll 1d6 for each adventurer in the appropriate order given the party’s marching formation to see if they trigger the hazard. On a roll of 1-2, the adventurer has accidentally triggered the hazard. On a roll of 3-6, the adventurer has accidentally bypassed the hazard entirely. Depending on its rolls, the party might immediately discover the hazard, accidentally bypass it, or be caught mid-formation. Hazards cannot be “disarmed” but can be bypassed. If the adventurers want to bypass the hazard, roll 1d12. On 1-8, it takes that many hours of backtracking. On a 9-12 there is no way to bypass the hazard in this hex. In either case, roll another encounter throw.

**Plague:** The party is exposed to a disease of some sort. When this occurs, the type of disease is determined with a roll of 1d100 on the Disease Type table. Subtract 10 if the party is in a swamp or jungle hex, and add 10 if the party is in a clear, glass, or scrublands hex. Once the disease is identified, each adventurer, follower, henchman, hireling, or other humanoid in the party must make a Death saving throw to see if he becomes infected. (If the party is reinforced with numerous followers or hirelings, you can roll once for each group of 30 followers or hirelings.) See Diseases on p. XX for more details.

|  |  |  |

| 14 | 2d6+1 doses of giant tarantula venom | 11+ |
| 15 | 2d6+1 doses of giant scorpion venom | 11+ |
| 16 | 2d4 doses of rockfish venom | 11+ |

| 18 | 1d3 doses of curare | 20+ |
| 19 | 1d3 doses of purple worm venom | 11+ |
| 20 | 1d3 doses of dragon blood | 11+ |

**Poison:** The adventurers find something poisonous. Roll on the Poisons table to determine what type of poison was found in what quantity. The poison may be disguised, and appear to be useful herbs or other valuable commodity. A character with Naturalism proficiency (or another appropriate proficiency) can identify the find with a proficiency throw of 11+. However, if the find is probed without proper caution, the adventurer is exposed to the poison and must succeed on a Death saving throw or suffer its effects.

If correctly identified, the poison can be harvested. Harvesting poison properly requires a Naturalism proficiency throw for a plant toxin or an Animal Husbandry proficiency throw for a creature venom. In either case, the required target value is listed on the adjoining table. On a roll of an unmodified 1, the gatherer has been exposed to the poison, and must succeed on a Death save or suffer its effects. Harvesting the poison takes 1 turn per dose. (Harvesting 6 doses of poison counts as a minor strenuous activity.) Doubling the harvest time increases the proficiency throw by +4, tripling it increases the proficiency throw by +8. Each dose harvested counts as one item for encumbrance purposes.

**Rough Going:** The hex is more difficult to traverse than is typical given the terrain type. There is no particular challenge that can be overcome nor is there any specific danger or hazard that can be bypassed, it simply is just rough going. All speeds are reduced by ½ in this hex.

**Spoilage:** Some event or terrain feature (a wagon throwing an axle, a horse throwing a hoof, a bag falling into the swamp, etc.) causes the adventurers to lose stored rations. Their expedition loses 1d8 x 5% of its stored rations.

**Trap:** The adventurers encounter a trap set in the wilderness. Determine the trap as if it were placed in the 5th level of a dungeon (see p. XX). If any adventurers in the party are proficient in Searching or Trapping, roll to see if they hastily detect the trap. If not, then roll 1d6 for each adventurer in the appropriate order given the party’s marching formation to see if they trigger it. On a roll of 1-2, the adventurer has accidentally activated the trap. On a roll of 3-6, the adventurer has accidentally missed the trap entirely and it remains inactivated. Depending on the result of these rolls, the party might immediately discover the trap, accidentally bypass it, or be caught mid-formation. 15% of traps guard treasure; if this trap guards treasure, determine the treasure type as per Cache by consulting the Treasure Type by Terrain table.

**Wasteland:** The hex is dead and barren. Reduce its Land Value by 1, to a minimum of 3. This result stacks if rolled multiple times in the same hex. For each wasteland hex that the party enters during a day, they suffer a -2 penalty to foraging throws that day.

**Double:** Roll twice on this table. If either or both rolls are 'double', again, roll on Unique Terrain instead. If neither reroll is 'double', the adventurers find both indicated dangerous terrain pieces. The adventurers cannot find one Unique and one Dangerous. For instance, if the rerolls are 12 and 3, the adventurers find only a piece of unique terrain, not a piece of unique terrain and a quagmire.)

###### Unique Terrain Encounters

| **9** | Portal |
| **10** | Relic |
| **11** | Truly Unique |

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Roll (1d6)** | **Treasure Type** | **Average Value** |
| **1** | K | 5,000 gp average value |
| **2** | L, J | 10,000 gp average value |
| **3** | P | 17,000 gp average value |
| **4** | Q | 22,000 gp average value |
| **5** | Ox2 | 24,000 gp average value |
| **6** | Q, N | 31,000 gp average value |

**Complex Map:** The adventurers find a location that is in itself a treasure map. An example might look similar to Stonehenge. It can be difficult to decipher the map, or even to learn that it is a map at all. If deciphered, it leads to a treasure. The treasure is 1 hex away per 1,000 gp value (you can use the average value and roll the actual contents of the treasure later). Roll 1d6 to determine the treasure type the map points to.

**Curse:** The adventurers find a cursed place or object. Roll on the Curse table to get some idea of what sort of curse has been found, and how it may affect the party. Some of the curses on the Curse table reflect their transmission or methodology, while others suggest what penalty the curse inflicts. If a penalty is not suggested, use the *bestow curse* spell as a starting point, or use any curse you have in mind.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Curse (1d10)** | |
| **1** | *Infectious:* The curse is infectious in some fashion. |
| **2** | *Transformational:* The curse transforms its victims. |
| **3** | *Intermittent:* The curse applies only at specific times. |
| **4** | *Devastating:* The effect of the curse is greater than normal. |
| **5** | *Horrifying:* The curse makes the victim fearsome to their allies. |
| **6** | *Confusing:* The curse affects the victim's thought patterns. |
| **7** | *Forgetful:* The curse affects the victim's memory. |
| **8** | *Enfeebling:* The curse affects the victim's physical attributes. |
| **9** | *Locational:* The curse affects the location, rather than specific victims. |
| **10** | *Object:* The curse is tied to an object, and affects its bearers or wielders. |

**Empowering Place:** The adventurers find a place capable of temporarily empowering non-magical items with the powers of a magical item. Choose or roll a magic item that the place is capable of duplicating, then choose a method by which the terrain can deliver this power. (For example, a cliff might empower the boots of someone who leaps off it with the powers of *boots of levitation*.) Only a non-magical item may be empowered, and only one such item may be empowered at a time. The empowered item will serve as the magical item for 1d6 days, but will then be destroyed. (It does not merely become nonmagical; the physical item is destroyed.) At your discretion, roll on the Structure table when placing an empowering place.

**Lesser Terrain:** The adventurers find something that appears unique at first, but turns out not to be. Roll on the Valuable or Dangerous terrain tables instead (50% chance of either). The terrain found will appear more fantastic than usual, but will function as normal.

**Magical Place:** The adventurers find a place that is capable of duplicating the effect of a spell of some kind. Choose or roll the source of the magic, then choose or roll a spell from the spell list. A good default method is to roll as if it were a scroll (p. XX). Finally, choose a method by which this place can duplicate the spell. The place is capable of creating the spell effect with a frequency determined by the level of spell, but never more often than once per day per target.

* *1st level:* 5/day
* *2nd level:* 3/day
* *3rd level:* 1/day
* *4th level:* 1/week
* *5th level:* 1/month
* *6th level:* 1/year
* *7th level and higher:* 1/decade or longer. (Ritual spells do not normally appear at these locations, but this suggested frequency is included should you decide to place one.)

At your option, you can roll on the Structure table when placing a magical place.

EXAMPLE: The party is exploring the Istrith Forest when the Judge rolls a magical place encounter. He rolls randomly to determine the spell as if it were a scroll, and the result is *restore life and limb*. Since *restore life and limb* is a 5th level spell, the magic place can cast it once per month. The Judge decides the magic place is a pool which casts *restore life and limb* on the first corpse placed within it on the first night of the new moon. He rolls 1d20 on the Structures table and the result is 11 – a monument. He decides that the ancient elves have erected a great menhir here, carved with pigmented paintings depicting the phases of the moon.

**Magical Resource:** The adventurers find a naturally-occurring magical resource. Treat as a special component or magical compound of your choice (or roll on the encounter table to find out what creature it counts as a component from). The magical resource does not require metamphora to store. It weighs 1 stone per 10 gp value and the adventurers find an amount worth 3d6 x 1,000gp. It takes one character an hour (one ancillary activity) to harvest 1,000gp worth of resources. If the party returns later, they will find that more has grown; you can assign a growth rate (a reasonable average is approximately 33 months to restore the full amount) or reroll its value.

**Monstrous Shadow:** A nearby terrible monster casts a shadow over the area (or brightens the area, if the monster is Lawful). Roll a monster encounter for the terrain to determine the type of terrible monster. If the encounter includes multiple monsters, only one of them is the terrible monster, and it leads the others. The terrible monster is always in a lair - even if its type does not normally make lairs. If the terrible monster has less than 11 HD, increase its HD to 11 as a result of the powers it has been infused with. For each HD of increase, the monster’s AC improves by 1 and the monster deals an average of 2 hp more damage divided among all its attacks. Increase the monster's size by one category, to a minimum of Large (ogre-sized). If its alignment is Neutral, change it to Chaotic. The terrible monster’s lair is a shadowed (minor) sinkhole of evil (or equivalent pinnacle of good, if Lawful). If it is slain, the sinkhole of evil (or pinnacle of good) will disperse in 1d4 days. The creature rarely goes far from its lair, but otherwise acts as normal for a creature of its type. The lair will have normal treasure for the monster’s type, plus additional treasure by terrain type.

EXAMPLE: When the adventurers enter a mountains hex, the Judge rolls a Monstrous Shadow result. He refers to the random encounter table for mountains terrain, and rolls a result of wyverns. Wyverns are encountered in aeries of 1d6, so he rolls 1d6 to determine the number of wyverns present. The result is 3, so three wyverns are present, one of which is the terrible monster. Wyverns are 7 HD monsters, so the terrible wyvern is increased to 11 HD. It gains a +2 bonus to AC (from 6 to 8) and adds 8 additional points of damage across its two attacks; the Judge decides its talons deal 3d8/3d8 rather than 2d8/2d8. The terrible wyvern’s aerie has treasure type M (typical for wyverns) plus N, D (from the Treasure Type by Terrain table).

**Place of Power:** The adventurers find a place of power of some kind. Roll to determine the type and power. You can also roll on the Structure table when placing a place of power to reflect past habitation of the place.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Type (1d10)** | |
| **1-4** | Sinkhole of evil |
| **5-6** | Pinnacle of good |
| **7** | Aerie of elemental air |
| **8** | Edifice of elemental earth |
| **9** | Furnace of elemental fire |
| **10** | Well of elemental water |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Power (1d12)** | |
| **1-11** | Minor |
| **12** | Roll again on the Major Power Table |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Major Power (1d12)** | |
| **1-11** | Major |
| **12** | Supreme |

**Portal:** The adventurers find a portal linking two locations. he portal might transfer only sensory information (sight and/or sound), or might allow travel through it. The portal might be always active, or might be limited in some fashion (such as functioning only during an eclipse). A portal that allows travel is always limited in some fashion (though a portal might be always active for sight and/or sound, but allow travel only in limited circumstances). You should choose a location for the other end of the portal that is appropriate for your setting. Note that the two ends of the portal can have different conditions for when they activate – for instance, one end could activate during a lunar eclipse while the other end activates during a solar eclipse – and the other end is not guaranteed to be a safe destination, making travel through an unknown portal extremely dangerous. At your discretion, the portal link might manifest in other ways than an actual portal (such as treating the two locations as the same for the purposes of spellcasting range).

**Relic:** The adventurers find a relic of a time long gone. The relic is not necessarily magical, but is valuable. Roll as for a Regalia (1d100+80 on the Jewelry Value table in Chapter 4) to determine its value. 25% of relics are also magical (choose or roll a magic item of at least rare quality); of those that are magical, 10% are cursed (Judge’s choice). For every 1,000gp of value, the relic has a 5% chance to be guarded by a monster or monsters with XP value equal to one-fourth its value.

**Truly Unique:** The adventurers find something truly unique. This category is a catch-all for anything you want to place in the hex (for instance, something you saw in a third-party product and thought was awesome). If you (justifiably) feel that the point of a random table is to keep from having to invent things whole cloth like this, choose another result or reroll!

**Double:** Roll twice and combine the results, which may be a single terrain feature with two powers or two different terrain features, at your discretion. If the result is rolled again, ignore it and reroll (there cannot be more than two Unique effects in a hex).

### Clearing the Wilderness

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Lairs per Hex** | |
| **Terrain Type** | **Lairs** |
| Barrens (any) | 1d4 |
| Desert (rocky) | 1d2 |
| Desert (sandy) | 1d4 |
| Forest (any) | 2d4 |
| Grassland (farm/prairie) | 1d3 |
| Grassland (steppe) | 1d3-1 |
| Hills (forested) | 2d4 |
| Hills (rocky) | 1d4 |
| Jungle | 2d8 |
| Mountains (forested) | 2d4 |
| Mountains (rocky/snowy) | 1d4+1 |
| Scrubland (low, sparse) | 1d2 |
| Scrubland (high, dense) | 2d4 |
| Swamp (any) | 2d4+1 |

Adventurers who seek to establish their own domains in unsettled territory must enter the area with other adventurers or mercenaries and drive off, kill, or pacify any monsters that dwell there. The larger the territory, the more challenging it is to clear it. Even a single 6-mile hex is an extensive tract of land: 31 square miles, or about 24,000 acres. A hex can support a considerable number of peasants when settled – and a considerable number of monster lairs when unsettled.

As Judge, you cannot (and should not) attempt to place every lair in every hex in advance. Your regional map would soon be filled to the brim with bear dens, rat nests, and other commonplace lairs, most of which will go undiscovered and unused. Instead, you should place lairs only when the adventurers decide to begin clearing hexes, either during prep before the session or dynamically during the session.

You can quickly determine the number and type of lairs in a hex by following these steps:

1. Consult the Lairs per Hex table and find the terrain type that best matches the terrain in the hex. Roll the listed dice to determine how many lairs are present.
2. For each lair, roll 1d20 on the Monster Rarity by Territory Classification table and consult the resulting sub-table for the terrain type. Then Roll 1d20 on the appropriate Monster Encounter by Terrain Type and Rarity to determine the monster in that lair.
3. Build the lair using the ***ACKS II******Monstrous Manual*** or use a pre-existing lair from ***Lairs & Encounters***or other published sourcebooks.

Most wilderness hexes will have two to six lairs. Lairs will be more densely packed in rough terrain that provides lots of cover, vegetation, and water (such as jungles and swamps) and less densely packed in open terrain with long lines of sight, sparse vegetation, and limited water (such as deserts and grasslands).

#### Replacing Lairs with Terrain Encounters (Optional)

When stocking hexes, you can substitute terrain encounters for up to 50% of the monster lairs. To do this randomly, roll 1d10 for each lair: 1-5, monster lair; 6-7: valuable terrain; 8-9, dangerous terrain; 10, unique terrain. To place terrain encounters, follow the steps outlined in p. XX of this chapter. You can also substitute a pre-planned point of interest for one or more monster lairs.

EXAMPLE: At the end of last session, the party decided its next expedition would be to clear the small forest nearby (3 6-mile hexes) in order to build a border fort there for the party’s explorer. For each of the three hexes, the Judge rolls 2d4 to determine the number of lairs. His rolls indicate there are 6 lairs in the first forest hex, 5 in the second forest hex, and 2 in the third forest hex.

He decides it would be interesting to have some terrain encounters mixed in with the monster lairs in the first hex. For each of the 6 lairs, he rolls 1d10. His results are 5, 1, 9, 7, 4, 6. Therefore there are three monster lairs (from the rolls of 5, 1, and 4), two valuable terrain encounters (from the rolls of 6 and 7), and one dangerous terrain encounter (from the roll of 9). He then follows the rules in this chapter to place the lairs and terrain encounters in the first hex.

#### Placing Lairs in Civilized, Borderlands, or Outlands Hexes

In the original rules of ***ACKS****,* it was possible for unsettled territory to be classified as civilized or borderlands due to proximity to a city or large town. Therefore, ***Lairs & Encounters***provided rules for determining the number of lairs in those classifications of territory. In ***ACKS II***, all unclaimed and unsecured territory is always considered unsettled. As such, there is no need for separate columns on the Lairs per Hex table anymore. If a hex isn’t part of a domain, it’s unsettled. If it is part of a domain, the hexes don’t usually have lairs unless they dynamically arise from random wilderness encounters or domain encounters.

That said, it’s easy to imagine unusual situations. Perhaps when the campaign begins, beastmen have recently invaded, or wild magic is causing monsters to spawn where they normally would never appear. In such cases, you might want to know the maximum number of lairs that theoretically could be present in a settled hex (given that there must be land usage by the population). For civilized territory, the maximum number of lairs is 33% the amount in unsettled territory; for borderlands, 50%; and for outlands, 66%.

## Sea Voyages

Adventures on the high seas are called voyages and can challenge the characters with lacerating weather, sea monsters, and enemy vessels. Sea voyages are common in the mid- and high-levels of play but can happen earlier if the campaign is focused on nautical action.

### Sequence of Play (Sea Voyages)

During a sea voyage, gameplay is handled in increments of **game days** and **hours**. Each game day, the adventurers can undertake 1 dedicated activity (8 hours) and 4 ancillary activities (1 hour each).

1. **Determine Weather:** Determine the wind strength and wind direction (***ACKS II RR***, p. XX). Optionally, determine overall weather conditions. Weather conditions such as Frigid, Foggy, Rainy, Stormy, Windy, etc. can apply penalties to certain activities.
2. **Check for Starvation, Dehydration, and Scurvy:** Check to see if any creatures on the voyage are starving, dehydrated, or scurvy. If so, starving creatures lose 1 CON and dehydrated creatures lose 1d6 CON (or 2d6 CON if weather conditions are Sweltering). Scurvy characters lose 1 STR and 1 CON immediately and another point of STR and CON each week thereafter during this step.
3. **Determine Activities:** Ask the party what dedicated and/or ancillary activities it plans to undertake. Usually this will simply be traveling.
4. **Check for Daily Encounters:** If the vessel is under anchor or the crew will be fishing, roll to see if any random encounters will occur that day. If a random encounter will occur, roll 1d12 to determine the hour of its occurrence.
5. **Check if the Vessel is Lost:** If the vessel is moving, check to see if it stays on course (***ACKS II RR***, p. XX). If it gets lost, determine the direction they will erroneously be sailing.
6. **Adjudicate Each Hour:** Each of the 12 adventuring hours in the day, follow the steps below.
   1. *Determine Direction of Sail:* Ask the captain of the vessel what direction the vessel is sailing.
   2. *Determine Maximum Vessel Speed:* Determine the vessel’s maximum speed for the hour based on its direction, the wind direction, and the wind strength.
   3. *Determine Actual Vessel Speed:* Ask the captain of the vessel the actual speed. (Sometimes the captain might want to sail at less than maximum speed so as not to overshoot a destination.)
   4. *Adjudicate Special Activities:* If the party is undertaking any activities this hour, adjudicate them now.
   5. *Adjudicate Movement:* Adjust the vessel’s position on your nautical map based on one hour of travel at its chosen speed in the appropriate direction. If this causes the party to enter a new hex, roll to see if a random encounter occurs. If an encounter occurs, follow the encounter procedure (described below).
   6. *Adjudicate Weather Effects.* If weather conditions are Frigid, check to see if any creature becomes hypothermic either from cold water or lack of protective clothing. Each hypothermic creature loses 1d3 CON now. If weather conditions are Sweltering, check to see if any creatures in heavy armor become fatigued now.
7. **Resolve Fishing:** If any adventurers or crew have been fishing, roll to see if they caught fish. If so, add the fish to their available supplies of rations.
8. **Consume Rations:** Mark off no, half, or full food rations and no, half, or full water rations for each creature on the journey.
   1. If any underfed creature eats a full ration of food, the condition ends.
   2. If any starving creature eats a full ration of food, the condition ends and the creature becomes underfed.
   3. If any dehydrated creature drinks a full ration of water, the condition ends.
   4. If any creature has gone 2 consecutive days without food, or 5 consecutive days with half rations, it becomes underfed.
   5. If any creature has been underfed for 5 days with no food, or for 10 days with an average of half rations, it becomes starving.
   6. If any creature has gone a day without water, or 2 days with half water, it becomes dehydrated.
9. **Adjudicate Weather Effects:** Follow the steps below to resolve any additional weather effects.
   1. *Disease:* If any creature has suffered seven consecutive days of Frigid or Rainy weather, check to see if it catches a disease (10% chance). If so, resolve the disease using the rules on p. XX.
   2. *Hypothermia:* If any creature on the expedition was hypothermic or suffered cold damage in Frigid temperatures, check to see if they suffer Frostbite. If so, resolve its effects.
   3. *Snow:* If conditions were Flurry for three consecutive days or Snowy today, terrain becomes Snowy. If conditions were Sweltering today, or Mild for the past seven days, the snow melts.
   4. *Sunburn:* If conditions were Sunbaked today, creatures that lacked protective clothing take 1 fire damage.
10. **Adjudicate Fatigue**: Check to see if any creatures on the expedition has undertaken six consecutive days of strenuous activity (or the equivalent thereof by force marching). If so, it becomes fatigued (***ACKS II*** *RR,* p. XX).
11. **Adjudicate Healing**: If any characters rested, they heal 1d3 hit points, or 2d3 hit points if under the care of a healer.
12. **Assess Nighttime Situation**: If the vessel is anchoring at night, roll to see if any random encounters will occur that night. If a random encounter will occur, roll 1d12 to determine the hour of its occurrence and resolve it at that time. If under sail or oar, revert to step 1 and run 12 hours of nighttime travel.
13. **Advance Calendar:** Mark off 1 day of game time.

Do not feel strictly beholden to this sequence. Sometimes, to adjudicate the action, you’ll need to adjust the sequence of events, other times disregard it altogether. The sequence of play is just intended as a checklist, not a mandate from heaven.

### Encounters at Sea

Like wilderness expeditions, sea voyages can confront adventurers with dangerous monsters, hazardous terrain, and more.

#### Frequency of Encounter Throws

The frequency of sea encounter throws is determined by the activities of the vessel and the classification of the territory. For purposes of encounters, sea territory can be classified as follows:

* Sea hexes within 6 miles (1 hex) of shoreland have the same territory classification of the shoreland.
* Sea hexes more than 6 miles but less than 24 miles (4 hexes) from shore reduce the territory classification of the shoreland by one step (e.g. from civilized to borderlands).
* All other sea hexes count as unsettled.

|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Activity** | **Civilized** | **Borderlands** | **Outlands** | **Unsettled** |
| Anchored/Beached (day) | None | None | None | Once per 12 hours |
| Anchored/Beached (night) | Once per 7 nights | Once per 3 nights | Once per 12 hours | Once per 12 hours |
| Fishing | Once per attempt | Once per attempt | Once per attempt | Once per attempt |
| Searching | Once per hour | Once per hour | Once per hour | Once per hour |
| Sailing/Rowing | Once per 24-mile hex | Once per 24-mile hex | Once per 24-mile hex | Once per 24-mile hex |
| Sailing/Rowing (trade route) | Once per 6-mile hex | Once per 6-mile hex | Once per 6-mile hex | Once per 6-mile hex |

#### Making Sea Encounter Throws

To make a sea encounter throw, follow these steps:

1. Roll 1d20 on the appropriate column of the Sea Encounters by Territory Classification table.
2. If the roll indicates a “Column Shift, Roll Again” result, shift one column right on the Sea Encounters by Territory Classifications table and roll again.
3. If the roll indicates a “No Encounter” result, there is no encounter.
4. If the roll indicates a “Civilized Encounter” result, roll 1d100 on the Civilized Encounter by Territory Classification table to find the type of creature encountered.
5. If the roll indicates a “Monster Encounter” result:
   1. Roll 1d20 on the Monster Rarity by Territory Classification table and consult the resulting sub-table for the terrain type.
   2. Roll 1d100 on the appropriate Monster Encounter by Terrain Type and Rarity to find the type of creature encountered.
6. If creatures have been encountered in steps 4 or 5:
   1. Find the encountered creature’s entry in the ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual***and roll against its **Lair** characteristic to determine whether the creature is in its lair. (If the creature is in its lair, a **dynamic lair** can be used if one is available).
   2. Roll the appropriate **number encountered** for the creature to determine how many are present.
   3. Follow the rules for Sea Encounter Distance to determine the distance in feet at the start of the encounter. If the creature is in its lair, the encounter distance is the distance to the lair. (If the lair is underwater, the depth counts as additional distance). If the creature is outside its lair, the encounter distance is the distance to the creature.
   4. Check for surprise and evasion, where necessary, and then proceed to reactions or combat.
7. If the roll indicates a “Nautical Encounter” result, treat it as a result of “No Encounter” if the party is anchored/beached or is following a known or previously-charted route. Otherwise, roll 1d12 on the appropriate Nautical Encounter sub-table to determine the nature of the encounter.

The results of rolls on the Sea Encounter tables and sub-tables should always be handled in a fashion that makes sense in the context of the terrain, weather, time of year, and other factors. If necessary to maintain the verisimilitude of the setting, disregard the result and roll again.

#### Sea Encounter by Territory Classification

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | **Civilized +**  **Trade Route** | **Civilized or Borderlands**  **+ Trade Route** | **Borderlands or**  **Outlands + Trade Route** | **Outlands or**  **Unsettled +**  **Trade Route** | **Unsettled** |

| Nautical Encounter | - | 20 | 20 | 19 - 20 | 18 - 20 |

Roll 1d20 on the appropriate column of the Sea Encounters by Territory Classification table. If the party is traveling along a trade route, be sure to use the “+ Trade Route” column for the territory class. If the party is sailing at night in civilized, borderlands, or outlands territory, shift one column to the right.

#### Sea Civilized Encounters

Roll 1d100 on the Sea Civilized Encounter by Territory Classification table to find the type of creature encountered.

#### Sea Monster Encounters

Sea monster encounters can confront the vessel with anything from a pirate fleet to a kraken. The farther the party travels from civilization, the more likely the party is to face rare and dangerous monsters.

###### Sea Monster Rarity by Terrain Classification

Roll 1d20 and cross-reference the result with the territory classification on the Monster Rarity by Terrain Classification table. After determining whether the monster encountered is common, uncommon, rare, or very rare, proceed to the Sea Monster Encounter by Rarity table.

|  |  |  |  |  |

###### Sea Monster Encounters by Rarity

Roll 1d100 and cross-reference the result with the monster rarity on the Sea Monster Encounters by Rarity table. Flyers will be in the air unless at a lair; flyer lairs will be on small and uncharted islets, reefs, shipwrecks., etc.

#### Nautical Encounters

Nautical encounters include terrain encounters (of the sort that can occur on land) as well as various accidents, boons, and events that can occur on the high seas. Adventurers might discover treasure-laden derelicts, sail through dead waters, or encounter supernatural phenomena.

###### Type of Encounter

There are three types of nautical encounters – beneficial, detrimental, and unique. The type of nautical encounter that confronts the vessel is determined by rolling 1d12 on the table below.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Nautical Encounter Type (1d12)** | |
| **1-5** | Beneficial Nautical Encounter |
| **6-10** | Detrimental Nautical Encounter |
| **11-12** | Unique Nautical Encounter |

Remember, nautical encounters do not occur if the party is anchored/beached or are following a known or previously-charted route.

###### Depth

When necessary to resolve a nautical encounter, the depth of the seafloor can be randomly determined based on the vessel’s distance from shore. Submerged features can only be spotted from the surface to a depth of 120’. (Of course, if you’ve mapped the seafloor of your campaign setting, you can use the values from your map instead. At least one ***ACKS II***Judge is known to have done this.)

|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Distance to Shore** | **1-4 Hexes** | **5-8 Hexes** | **9-11 Hexes** | **12+ Hexes** |
| **Depth** | 2d4 x 50’ | 2d8 x 50’ | 3d6 x 500’ | 3d6 x 1000’ |

###### Vessels

When any sub-table result directs a roll for Vessel Type, choose or roll for a result on this table. Rolling 1d20 will yield both commercial and military vessels, while 1d10+5 will yield primarily military vessels.

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Roll** | **Vessel Type** | **Roll** | **Vessel Type** |
| **1** | Barge, Small | **11** | Galley, 3-Rower |
| **2** | Barge, Small | **12** | Galley, 4-Rower |
| **3** | Barge, Large | **13** | Galley, 5-Rower |
| **4** | Barge, Large | **14** | Galley, 8-Rower |
| **5** | Barge, Huge | **15** | Longship |
| **6** | Galley, 1-Rower | **16** | Sailing Ship, Small |
| **7** | Galley, 1.5-Rower | **17** | Sailing Ship, Small |
| **8** | Galley, 2-Rower | **18** | Sailing Ship, Large |
| **9** | Galley, 2.5-Rower | **19** | Sailing Ship, Large |
| **10** | Galley, 3-Rower | **20** | Sailing Ship, Huge |

###### Treasure Types

When any sub-table result directs a roll for Treasure by Terrain, roll using the treasure type indicated by this table.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Territory Classification** | **Treasure Type** |
| Civilized | L,D |
| Borderlands | K,C |
| Outlands | L |
| Unsettled | O |

###### Beneficial Nautical Encounters

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Beneficial Encounter (1d12)** | |
| **1** | Castaway |
| **2** | Derelict |
| **3** | Favorable Current |
| **4** | Favorable Winds |
| **5** | Flotsam |
| **6** | Good Omen |
| **7** | Monster Carcass |
| **8** | Navigational Sign |
| **9** | Plentiful Fish |
| **10** | Safe Haven |
| **11** | Smooth Sailing |
| **12** | Double |

**Castaway:** The vessel spots a castaway drifting across the water on a canoe, raft, sailboat, or wrecked piece of hull. Generate the castaway using the tables on p. XX – p. XX. The castaway will automatically have a Friendly reactions if rescued. He knows one rumor (probably related to whatever destroyed his vessel) and could be recruited as a henchman.

**Derelict:** The vessel spots a derelict drifting in the water. Roll 1d20 on the Vessels sub-table to determine the type of vessel. The derelict has only 2d4 x 10% of its SHP, the rest having been lost to battle damage, monster attack, weather, or other causes. There is a 25% chance the derelict’s hold will contain cargo equal to its maximum capacity times its percentage of SHP remaining. Roll once on the Random Merchandise table for every 1,000 st to determine the type.

EXAMPLE: The adventurers’ vessel spots a derelict. The Judge rolls 1d20 on the Vessel sub-table and gets a 16, so the derelict is a small sailing ship (75 SHP and 10,000 st cargo capacity). The Judge uses 2d4 x 10% to determine how many structural hit points the derelict has left; he rolls 40%, so the ship has only 30 SHP remaining. Next the Judge checks to see if the derelict is carrying cargo; a roll of 17 on 1d100 says it is. Since it has only 40% of its SHP, it has only 40% of its maximum cargo, or 4,000 st. The Judge rolls for 4 lots of 1,000 st each on the Random Merchandise table.

**Favorable Current:** The vessel benefits from a strong underwater current that helps propel it in its desired direction. The vessel’s speed is increased by 50% in this hex.

**Favored Winds:** The gods of the seas have smiled on the vessel, and it enjoys favorable winds. If the vessel is not running before the wind, shift the wind direction by 30 degrees towards the vessel’s preferred direction. If the vessel is already running before the wind, adjust the wind speed by one step towards strong.

**Flotsam:** The vessel spots cargo floating on the water. The encounter distance to the flotsam is determined as if they were flying creatures. There will be 2d6 lots each of 1,000 st. Roll on the Random Merchandise table for each lot, re-rolling results of common metal, tools, armor & weapons, and precious merchandise.

**Good Omen:** The vessel is blessed with a good omen, such as an albatross flying around the ship, dolphins swimming at the bow, or a rainbow appearing in the sky. The crew is so inspired that it can ignore the next morale calamity that occurs.

**Monster Carcass:** The vessel comes upon the floating carcass of a monster or monsters. Roll on the Monster Encounter table to determine the type of creature(s). The encounter distance to the carcass(es) is determined as if they were flying creatures. The corpse(s) are 1d4 days old. The monster will have salvageable parts as per ***ACKS Lairs & Encounters*** *or* ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual***.

**Navigational Sign:** The navigator benefits from a lighthouse, landmark, or other astronomical or terrain feature that helps keep him on course. If the vessel is currently lost, the navigator learns its actual position. If the vessel is currently on course, the navigator gains a +4 bonus to his next throw to avoid getting lost. Mark down the location of the navigational sign on your campaign map, as it will remain there going forward.

**Plentiful Fish:** The vessel has sailed into a region of water with abundant sea-life. Catching fish is as easy as lowering a line or tossing a net. Even if it does not stop to fish, the vessel gains 4d10 x 2 pounds of standard rations per 20 crew. If the vessel stops, each fisher that spends an ancillary activity fishing can capture 4d10 x 2 lbs of standard rations on a successful Fishing proficiency throw. Remember that 2 pounds of rations are sufficient to feed one person for one day. One week of rations weighs 1 stone. Be sure to mark down the location of plentiful fish on your campaign map, as it will remain there going forward.

**Safe Haven:** The vessel has spotted a safe haven such as a coastal cave or grotto, estuary, fjord or inlet, or hidden cove. It can anchor, beach, or harbor at the safe haven and enjoy protection from inclement weather and spotting by passersby. Do not roll encounter throws while the vessel is in the safe haven. Mark down the location of the safe haven on your campaign map, as it will remain there going forward. However, if the vessel is not within sight of the shore, treat this result as Smooth Sailing.

**Smooth Sailing:** The voyage is going as well as can be expected! The vessel ignores the next sea monster encounter or detrimental nautical encounter that would otherwise occur.

**Double:** Roll twice on this table. If either or both rolls are 'double', again, roll on Unique Nautical Encounters instead. If neither reroll is 'double', the vessel runs into both indicated beneficial nautical encounters.

###### Detrimental Nautical Encounters

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Detrimental Encounter (1d12)** | |
| **1** | Bad Omen |
| **2** | Dead Sea |
| **3** | Food Spoilage |
| **4** | Mariner Overboard |
| **5** | Nautical Challenge |
| **6** | Nautical Hazard |
| **7** | Rogue Wave |
| **8** | Rough Conditions |
| **9** | Unpredictable Weather |
| **10** | Water Spoilage |
| **11** | Wear-and-Tear |
| **12** | Double |

**Bad Omen:** The vessel’s crew is unsettled by a bad omen, such as an albatross getting injured by flying into the rigging, red skies appearing in the morning, or a shark following the ship. Being a superstitious lot, the crew considers this a morale calamity.

**Dead Sea:** The sea here is lifeless. This might be due to natural causes, such as hypoxic or oligotrophic conditions, or it might be due to magical or monstrous activity. The vessel cannot fish in this hex. Mark down the location of the dead sea on your campaign map, as it will remain there going forward.

**Food Spoilage:** Bad packing, mold infection, rat infestation, or some other accident or negligence causes the vessel to lose 2d10% of its stored food. The crew considers this a morale calamity.

**Mariner Overboard:** An NPC on the vessel has fallen from the rigging or been thrown overboard by the ship’s heaving and churning. Roll randomly to determine who has fallen overboard; there is an equal chance of it being any crew or passengers on deck. If not rescued (whether by magic, swimming, throwing a rope, etc.) the NPC will eventually drown. If the NPC is a crew member and no effort is made to rescue him, the remaining crew considers this a morale calamity.

**Nautical Challenge:** Accident, age, inclement weather, or wear-and-tear have caused a deterioration in a critical component of the vessel. Until the problem is fixed, the vessel cannot move at greater than 1/4 speed. Fixing the problem swiftly will require one of the crew to succeed on 1d3 difficult and dangerous proficiency throws. Roll 1d10 on the Challenge Type table to find the exact nature of the challenge. If a nautical challenge occurs during very strong winds (Windy conditions), apply a -4 penalty to the proficiency throw. If a nautical challenge occurs during gale winds (Stormy conditions), apply a -10 penalty. If none of the crew can or does meet the challenge, roll 1d12, adding 4 in Windy conditions and 10 in Stormy conditions. That many hours are lost finding another solution to the challenge. Roll for another encounter throw.

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Challenge Type** | | |
| **Die Roll** | **Challenge** | **Example Obstacle** |
| 1 | Balancing Traverse (narrow) | Move outboard to the quarters of a yard to re-secure braces that have come loose |
| 2 | Balancing Traverse (precarious) | Move outboard to the edge of a yardarm to re-attach lifts that have come loose |
| 3 | Climbing (easy) | Climb up a moving boom to install or take off sail covers |
| 4 | Climbing (sheer) | Climb up a main-mast destabilized by loose rigging and re-secure the braces |
| 5 | Crawling Traverse | Shimmy along underside of a yardarm to re-attach lifts that have come loose |
| 8 | Rappelling | Rappel down the size of the ship to repair a hole in the hull |
| 9 | Squeezing | Squeeze through narrow, tangled spaces in ship’s hold to secure shifted cargo |
| 10 | Swimming | Dive underwater to repair rudder or disentangle the ship from entanglement |

**Nautical Hazard:** The hex the vessel has entered contains a nautical hazard. Nautical hazards include underwater or partially submerged rocks, coral reefs, kelp forests, sandbars, seamounts, shoals, sunken wrecks, and whirlpools. Roll 1d20 to determine the nature of the hazard. (Feel free to devise other nautical hazards for your setting!) Unless the hazard is a recent development, characters with Navigation and Seafaring proficiency will know about the hazards on common routes and can simply sail or row around them.

When a vessel enters a hex containing a nautical hazard, the captain must make a Seafaring proficiency throw of 11+ (7+ if master mariner). If the vessel is moving at 1/2 speed or less, the captain gains a +4 bonus. If the vessel is a galley or longship, the captain gains +4 if navigating sandbars/shoals. If the throw succeeds, the vessel safely traverses the hex. If the throw fails, the vessel runs into the hazard, suffering the effects described below. The suggestions for spells to escape nautical hazards are just that and are not intended to be an exclusive list of the ways a vessel might benefit from magic.

* *Kelp Forest:*The vessel is entangled in seaweed. It cannot move until it is disentangled. Disentangling the vessel requires 1d4 hours plus an additional hour per 60 tons the vessel weighs. A *disintegrate* or *dominate plants* spell can instantly disentangle the vessel.
* *Rock/Reef/Seamount/Wreck:*The vessel strikes the hazard below the waterline and suffers 8d10 structural piercing damage. If the vessel was traveling at 1/2 speed or less when it entered the hex, damage is halved.
* *Sandbar/Shoal:*The vessel runs aground and suffers 4d10 structural bludgeoning damage. If the vessel was traveling at 1/2 speed or less when it entered the hex, damage is halved. The vessel cannot move until it is refloated by high tide in 1d12 hours (Judge’s discretion) or until the vessel is freed from the shoal. The crew can attempt to free the vessel by lightening its load or by rocking it back and forth to dislodge it. Lightening the load grants a cumulative 5% chance the vessel escapes for every 200 st of cargo thrown overboard. Each crew member can unload 33 st of cargo per turn (200 st per hour). Rocking the vessel back and forth requires the entire crew to work at shifting ballast and cargo back and forth through the hold. Rocking the vessel grants a 5% cumulative chance per turn that the vessel escapes, but each time the roll fails the vessel suffers 1d4 structural bludgeoning damage. *Force of impetus* can dislodge the vessel immediately but deals 4d10 structural damage to it. *Earth’s movement* can dislodge the vessel in one turn.
* *Whirlpool:*The vessel is sucked into a whirling maelstrom of water with spouting upswelling fountains and swirling vortices of depressed water. When the vessel enters the whirlpool, and at the end of each round that it remains in the whirlpool, it suffers 25-40 (1d4+4 x 5) structural bludgeoning damage and each crew member on deck must succeed on a Paralysis saving throw or be thrown overboard and must swim or drown. Swimming proficiencies suffer a -8 penalty in a whirlpool. On the captain’s initiative, he can make a Seafaring proficiency throw to steer out of the whirlpool. The target value is based on the vessel’s speed, as if targeted by a *capsizing wave* (p. XX). If the captain’s proficiency throw succeeds, the vessel escapes. If the captain’s proficiency throw fails, the vessel does not escape that round.

Mark down the location of the nautical hazard on your campaign map, as it will remain there going forward.

| Gentle | +15 | 1d4+4 | - |
| Moderate | +10 | 1d4+4 x 5 | 1d2+2 |
| Strong | +5 | 1d4 +4 x 10 | 1d4+4 |
| Very Strong | +2 | 1d4+4 x 20 | 1d4+4 x 2 |
| Gale | 0 | 1d4+4 x 50 | 1d4+4 x 5 |

**Rogue Wave:** A sudden and unexpected swell of water threatens to slam into the vessel, possibly capsizing it. Treat the rogue wave as a *capsizing wave* spell, but modify the damage and saving throw as shown based on wind conditions. Provided the captain succeeds on his Seafaring saving throw, the vessel cannot lose more than 25% of its SHP to this encounter. Re-roll this encounter if the wind speed is Still.

**Rough Conditions:** The water is choppy and rough, and the wind is ever-shifting. There is no particular challenge that can be overcome nor is there any danger or hazard that can be bypassed, it simply is just rough going. All speeds are reduced by 1/2 in this hex.

**Unpredictable Weather:** Nothing is as unpredictable as the weather at sea. When this encounter occurs, immediately re-roll the day’s weather, including temperature, precipitation, wind strength, and wind direction.

**Water Spoilage:** Leaky caskets, fouled water, or some other accident or negligence causes the vessel to lose 2d10% of its stored water. The crew considers this a morale calamity.

**Wear-and-Tear:** The vessel takes 1 structural bludgeoning damage from the wear-and-tear of salt water, waves, and winds. This damage cannot be repaired at sea but can be repaired if the ship beaches/docks. Note that this encounter is much more dangerous to small vessels with low SHP!

**Double:** Roll twice on this table. If either or both rolls are 'double', again, roll on Unique Terrain instead. If neither reroll is 'double', the vessel runs into both indicated dangerous nautical encounters.

###### Unique Nautical Encounters

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Unique Encounters (1d12)** | |
| **1** | Colossal Statue |
| **2** | Damned Mariners |
| **3** | Deafening Mist |
| **4** | Ghost Ship |
| **5** | Leviathan |
| **6** | Magical Resource |
| **7** | Marine Formation |
| **8** | Message in a Bottle |
| **9** | Place of Power |
| **10** | Sunken Treasure Ship |
| **11** | Truly Unique |
| **12** | Double |

**Colossal Statue:** A colossal statue of a god of the sea emerges from the water here. The statue is large enough to stretch to the sea floor below, while its highest point (head, trident, tentacle, or other feature) juts out from the waterline by 2d6 x 10’. If the colossal statue appears along a trade route, then it has only recently emerged in the last 1d3 days due to tectonic movement of the seabed, and its exposed portions will be covered by strands of kelp and seaweed. Mark down the location of the colossal statue on your campaign map, as it will remain there going forward.

The appearance, magical powers, and significance of the statue is left to the Judge’s discretion. It could be anything from a curiosity to a dungeon crawl into the depths. In the Auran Empire campaign setting, roll 1d6 to determine which god the statue represents: 1-3 it’s Naurivus, Empyrean god of the high seas; 4-6 it’s Lammala, Chthonic god of the oceanic abyss. In either case, such a colossus could only have been built before the apocalyptic Day Without Night.

**Damned Mariners:** A mysterious vessel with tattered sails becomes visible on the horizon. Roll 1d10+5 on the Vessels sub-table to determine the type of vessel. However, this is no ordinary vessel – this is a ship crewed by the damned! Each mariner and marine is a **haugbui** while the navigator is a **7HD draugr** and the captain is **9 HD** **draugr**. (You can substitute other undead if desired.) The ship has lost 2d10% of its SHP to battle damage, monster attack, weather, or other causes, but this does not reduce its movement while the undead crew it. The damned crew are automatically hostile and will attempt to intercept the party’s vessel and board it.

Treat the ship of the damned as the draugr’s barrow for all purposes; once the ship of the damned has grappled the party’s vessel, the party’s vessel is part of the barrow. If everyone on board the party’s vessel is slain or fled, the slain crew rise as haugbui under the command of the draugr. If among the slain crew there were leveled characters of 7th level or more, then the two highest level characters rise as draugr rather than haugbui. The damnation spreads…

The ship as a whole is a blighted sinkhole of evil, which can only be purged by scuttling it. The ship of the damned will be laden with treasure – roll twice for treasure type Q.

**Deafening Mist:** The air falls still and mist suddenly shrouds the vessel. But this is no ordinary mist – it not only creates Foggy weather conditions that reduce visibility to just 20’, it also deadens all sound. All characters are considered **deafened** while in the mist. Does something lurk in this silent shroud? Maybe! Roll for an additional random encounter, treating a civilized encounter as no encounter. After resolving the encounter (if any), the vessel emerges from the mist one hour later, having traveled at its voyage speed in a random hex direction. The navigator must make an additional Navigation proficiency throw at a -4 penalty to avoid being lost with a -4 penalty.

**Ghost Ship:** The vessel spots a derelict drifting in the water. Roll 1d20 on the Vessels sub-table to determine the type of vessel. The vessel has lost 5d10% of its SHP to battle damage, monster attack, weather, or other causes. However, unlike an ordinary derelict, the vessel is a ghost ship. All of the mariners and marines are **haunts** confined to the vessel in endless repetition of the tasks they were doing just before death. The vessel as a whole is a shadowed sinkhole of evil. If the haunts are destroyed, the ship can be salvaged and its cargo claimed. For every 5 haunts, roll once on Treasure Type A.

**Leviathan:** A monstrous leviathan of some sort dwells in the depths. Roll a sea monster encounter to determine the type of leviathan, re-rolling any humanoids. If the encounter includes multiple monsters, only one of them is the leviathan, and it leads the others. The leviathan is always in a lair - even if its type does not normally make lairs. If the leviathan has less than 20 HD, increase its HD to 20 as a result of the powers it has been infused with. For each HD of increase, the leviathan’s AC improves by 1 and it deals an average of 2 hp more damage divided among all its attacks. Increase the monster's size by one category, to a minimum of Huge. If already Colossal, increase its HD by (another) 4 instead. If its alignment is Lawful or Neutral, change it to Chaotic. The leviathan’s lair is a shadowed sinkhole of evil. If it is slain, the sinkhole of evil will disperse in 1d4 days. The creature rarely goes far from its lair, but considers any vessels which traverse the vicinity to be prey. The lair will have normal treasure for the monster’s type, plus additional treasure type O. Mark down the location of the leviathan’s lair on your campaign map, as it will remain there going forward.

**Magical Resource:** The vessel comes upon a naturally-occurring magical resource worth 3d6 x 1,000gp. The resource might be eldritch coral, magic kelp, mana-infused fish, etc. Roll on the encounter table to find out what creature it counts as a component from. The magical resource does not require metamphora to store. It weighs 1 stone per 10 gp value. It takes one character an hour (one ancillary activity) to harvest 1,000gp worth of resources. Mark down the location of the magical resource on your campaign map, as it will remain there going forward. If the vessel returns later to the magical resource, they will find that more has grown; you can assign a growth rate (a reasonable average is approximately 33 months to restore the full amount) or reroll its value.

**Marine Formation:** The vessel comes upon marine formation of sublime beauty and vast extent. It could be a blue hole, a colorful coral reef, a kelp forest, an underwater waterfall, a seamount, etc. The marine formation has a 25% chance of also being a well of elemental water; roll on the table below for power. The marine formation has a 50% chance of being occupied by sea creatures; roll for a Sea Monster encounter and place a monster lair in the marine formation. Mark the location of the marine formation on your campaign map, as it will remain there going forward.

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Roll (1d6)** | **Treasure Type** | **Average Value** |
| **1** | K | 5,000 gp average value |
| **2** | L, J | 10,000 gp average value |
| **3** | P | 17,000 gp average value |
| **4** | Q | 22,000 gp average value |
| **5** | Ox2 | 24,000 gp average value |
| **6** | Q, N | 31,000 gp average value |

**Message in a Bottle:** The vessel spots a sealed bottle floating in the water. If the bottle is recovered and opened, it reveals a message within. The exact nature of the message is left to your discretion but often such messages contain cryptic hints to the location of a valuable buried treasure. Roll 1d6 to determine the treasure type the message points to. The treasure is 1 hex away per 1,000 gp value (you can use the average value and roll the actual contents of the treasure later).

**Place of Power:** The vessel travels over or through a place of power of some kind. Roll to determine the type and power. The existence of the place of power will be evident from observable phenomena, such as strange swirling air currents, smoky water from subterranean vents, a huge blue hole in the sea floor, etc. Mark down the location of the place of power on your campaign map, as it will remain there going forward.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Type (1d10)** | |
| **1** | Sinkhole of evil |
| **2** | Pinnacle of good |
| **3** | Aerie of elemental air |
| **4** | Edifice of elemental earth |
| **5** | Furnace of elemental fire |
| **6-10** | Well of elemental water |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Power (1d12)** | |
| **1-11** | Minor |
| **12** | Roll again on the Major Power Table |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Major Power (1d12)** | |
| **1-11** | Major |
| **12** | Supreme |

**Portal:** The vessel discovers a portal linking two locations. The portal might transfer only sensory information (sight and/or sound), or might allow travel through it. The portal might be always active, or might be limited in some fashion (such as functioning only during an eclipse). A portal that allows travel is always limited in some fashion (though a portal might be always active for sight and/or sound, but allow travel only in limited circumstances). You should choose a location for the other end of the portal that is appropriate for your setting. Note that the two ends of the portal can have different conditions for when they activate – for instance, one end could activate during a lunar eclipse while the other end activates during a solar eclipse – and the other end is not guaranteed to be a safe destination, making travel through an unknown portal extremely dangerous. At your discretion, the portal link might manifest in other ways than an actual portal (such as treating the two locations as the same for the purposes of spellcasting range). Mark down the location of the portals on your campaign map, as they will remain there going forward.

**Sunken Treasure Ship:** The vessel spots a shipwreck visible 100’ + 1d6 x 10’ below. If the vessel is currently in deeper water, then the shipwreck is on an atoll, coral reef, seamount, or similar structure. Roll 1d20 on the Vessels sub-table to determine the type of shipwreck. The shipwreck will contain treasure equal to its maximum capacity. Roll 1d100. On 1-90, the treasure is common metal ingots (such as bronze, copper, iron, lead, or tin) worth 2gp per stone. On 90-99, the treasure is 90% common metal ingots and 10% of the cargo is precious metal ingots (such as electrum, gold, platinum, silver, or tumbaga) worth 100gp per stone. On 100, the treasure is entirely precious metal ingots. A sunken treasure ship has a 75% chance to be the lair of a monster. Roll on the Sea Monster table.

**Truly Unique:** The vessel discovers something truly unique. This category is a catch-all for anything you want to place in the hex (for instance, something you saw in a third-party product and thought was awesome). If you (justifiably) feel that the point of a random table is to keep from having to invent things whole cloth like this, choose another result or reroll!

**Double:** Roll twice and combine the results, which may be a single terrain feature with two powers or two different terrain features, at your discretion. If the result is rolled again, ignore it and reroll (there cannot be more than two Unique effects in a hex).

## Settlement Adventures

Adventures set within the bustling heartbeats of cities, towns, and other settlements present their own set of challenges and mysteries. Amidst the maze of narrow alleyways and grand boulevards, adventurers might grapple with political intrigue, navigate the underbelly of crime syndicates, rub shoulders with influential nobles, or uncover ancient secrets hidden beneath cobblestone streets. These rules offer guidelines for adventures in settlements.

### Sequence of Play

![](data:image/png;base64...)It is entirely up to you and your players how much or how little attention to pay to settlement adventurers. Some groups have built entire campaigns around settlement adventures, filled with crime, political intrigue, mercantile ventures, and similar shenanigans. Some groups prefer to treat trips to town as just a bookkeeping exercise in between sessions, preferring to devote their sessions to wilderness expeditions, dungeon delves, sea journeys, or military conquests. Most groups tend to do a bit of both, with the adventurers spending a session or two in a settlement in between major delves or expeditions.

There is therefore no hard-and-fast sequence of play for settlement adventures as there is for other types of adventure. Depending on the adventurers’ choice of activities, you might find yourself running settlement adventures on a turn-by-turn sequence as they sneak into the merchant guildhouse on some heist; running settlement adventurers on an hour-by-hour or day basis, like a wilderness expedition; or even just using the campaign activities rules between sessions.

For rules on how to construct a settlement, including stocking it with points of interest and dynamic generation of buildings, see Chapter 7: **Settlements** (p. XX).

### Movement in Settlements

Since tracking movement in feet per turn/round in even a small village would be tedious, movement across a settlement is better measured in units of **city blocks**. Blocks can vary in size, but so can traffic congestion, pedestrian density, road conditions, and more; handling movement block-by-block is a useful abstraction. When moving block-to-block, adventures can choose to move at **commuting speed** or **meandering speed**.

Commuting speed represents a pedestrian walking in a familiar neighborhood with a particular destination. At commuter speed, it takes about ten minutes (1 turn) to walk five city blocks. Characters moving at commuter speed must make a Navigation throw of 11+ every turn to avoid getting lost. If the characters have traveled to the destination before, but not by this route, add +4 to the throw. Characters who get lost end up 1d4+1 blocks away from their intended destination that turn. Once the characters have traveled a particular route before no Navigation throw is required.

Meandering speed represents a sightseer or shopper exploring an unfamiliar neighborhood, stopping to take in all the sights and sounds along the way. At meandering speed, it takes about ten minutes (1 turn) to walk one city block. Characters moving at meandering speed do not get lost as their slow pace makes it easy to see street signs or ask for directions.

Sometimes adventurers might prefer to travel by litter or wagon. This can afford an adventurer more privacy but is not any faster.

#### Straggling Groups (Optional)

Narrow streets and dense crowds make it hard to move in large groups. If the party is 7 or more characters, commuting speed is reduced by 50% (half speed). If the party is 15 or more characters, commuting speed is reduced by 75% (quarter speed). A party can split into smaller groups to avoid being slowed down but each group faces a separate encounter throw.

### Encounters in the Settlement

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Party**  **Location** | **Encounter**  **Frequency** | **Encounter**  **Throw (d6)** |
| Avenue (day) | Every hour (6 turns) | 6+ |
| Avenue (night) | Every 30 minutes (3 turns) | 6+ |
| Alley (day) | Every 30 minutes (3 turns) | 6+ |
| Alley (night) | Every 10 minutes (1 turn) | 5+ |
| Holed Up (day/night) | Every day (24 hours) | 5+ |

For urban adventures, the concept of the random encounter needs to be revised. A city is packed with people and an adventurer who even steps foot out of his room at the inn, let alone takes a walk down a thoroughfare, will almost certainly “encounter” random strangers – but these will be normal men and women with whom the adventurers will likely have little reason to converse. A random encounter in an urban adventure therefore represents some sort of unusual incident or interruption: an interesting public occurrence or happening that attracts the attention or the adventurers or an unexpected development which directly disrupts the adventurers’ planned activities and forces them to act.

#### Wandering the Streets

You should make an encounter throw every hour (6 turns) the adventurers are wandering avenues by day, every 30 minutes (3 turns) they are wandering avenues by night or alleyways by day, and every 10 minutes (1 turn) they are wandering alleyways at night. An encounter occurs on 6+ on 1d6, or 5+ in alleys at night. Some sections of some settlements (e.g. a Thieves’ Quarter in the Old District) might be even more dangerous!

#### Holing Up

Sometimes a party of adventurers might hole up in a particular building or neighborhood for a long period of time – perhaps because they are recuperating in a hospital, perhaps because they are studying in the municipal library, perhaps they are training in the mercenary guildhouse. Whatever the case, they might want to avoid any “interesting” encounters that distract them from their purposes. When adventurers are actively staying out of trouble, make just one encounter throw every day. An encounter occurs on 5+ on 1d6 (e.g. once per 3 days on average).

#### Looking for Trouble

Sometimes a party of adventurers might take to the streets to look for trouble. By purposefully loitering in busy places, hiking down crowded streets, talking loudly on interesting topics, randomly approaching strangers, shoving through crowds, and generally making a nuisance of themselves, they can increase the chance of an encounter. When adventurers are looking for trouble, add +1 to the encounter throw (e.g. the chances increase by 1 in 6).

#### Settlement Encounters Table

Each time a random encounter occurs in an urban settlement, roll 1d100, adding 30 to the roll if after dark. The following settlement encounters table can be used in most Class I – Class IV settlements. They assume the default Auran Empire system is being used, but you should be able to easily adopt them to the particulars of your campaign setting.

**01-04:** 4d10 beggars, many of them disabled veterans, have formed a human wall that blocks the avenue and are berating passersby to give them alms for their past services. 2d4 members of the City Watch will disperse the beggars violently after 1d10 minutes. Adventurers who donate at least 1gp to the beggars before the Watch arrives learn an interesting rumor. Adventurers who bribe or drive off the City Watch receive 1d4 rumors and a pledge of aid from the beggars in the future.

**Beggars (4d10)**: SPD 60’, AC 0, HD 1-1, hp 2 each, #AT 1 (violent beratement), Dmg just guilt, Save NM, ML -2, AL N, XP 5

**City Watch Officers (2d4):** SPD 90’, AC 5 (chain & shield), HD 1-1, hp 4 each, #AT 1 (spear or short sword 11+), Dmg 1d6, Save NM, ML +1, AL L, XP 5; Equipment: belt pouch with 2sp and 20cp each

**05-08:** A merchant’s wagon has just lost a wheel and tilted over, sending 3d100 stone of merchandise sprawling into the filthy streets. Choose or roll on the Random Merchandise table in the ***ACKS II Revised Rulebook*** p. XX to determine type. The merchant and his teamster are loudly arguing over whose fault the accident was. A character can quietly steal a stone of goods with a successful Pickpocketing throw at +4. Characters who assist the merchant in repairing and re-loading his wagon are repaid with 30gp and a city rumor.

**09-12:** A bard stands on a stool on a street corner and serenades passersby with songs of glory and valor. A crowd of 1d10 is watching. With a tip of at least 1gp, the bard will share 1d3 interesting rumors. With a tip of at least 20gp accompanied by a Friendly reaction roll, the bard will pledge to sing songs of their adventures. This will decrease the chance the party is mistaken for a rival party of adventurers (see encounter 29-32).

**13-16**: A pair of wagons have collided and are blocking the road. Neither merchant is willing to back up and it’s degenerated into a shouting match. The adventurers lose one turn (10 minutes) pushing their way through the thick crowd of 2d100 gawkers. Make an additional encounter throw.

**17-20:** A street magician is entertaining a crowd of 3d10 local residents. He is using his Prestidigitation proficiency to form pipe-smoke into phantasmagorical monsters and the spell *auditory illusion* to make the smoke-monsters utter gossip about the city’s notables. The street magician aspires to greatness and would be easy to recruit as a henchman (+2 bonus), provided the party does not embarrass or humiliate him before the crowd with superior prowess.

**Street Magician:** Mage 1; STR 10, INT 16, WIL 11, DEX 14, CON 9, CHA 13; SPD 120’, AC 1, HD 1\*\*, hp 4, #AT 1 (dagger 10+), Dmg 1d4, Save M1, ML +1, AL N, XP 16; Proficiencies: Collegiate Wizardry, Performance (street magic) 3, Prestidigitation; Spellcasting: 1st – 1; Repertoire: 1st – *auditory illusion, wall of smoke, weave smoke;* Equipment: Ostentatious robes, pipe, belt pouch with 6sp and 20cp

**21-24:** 1d4 proselytizers are seeking congregants. Roll 1d8 to determine their patron deity: 1, Ammonar; 2, Calefa; 3, Ianna; 4, Istreus; 5, Mityara; 6, Naurivus; 7, Turas; 8, a minor or foreign deity (Judge’s choice). Each character willing to listen to the good news for one turn (10 minutes) will be rewarded with a free 1st or 2nd level spellcasting of their choice. The proselytizers know one rumor, which they will share if reactions are friendly.

**25-28:** A town crier is announcing the news of the day. The news is mostly mundane matters relating to upcoming festivals, market hours, and temple rites, but the town crier is a valuable resource for happenings of interest. On a Friendly reaction roll, the crier will share 2d3 interesting rumors. Half will be specific to the settlement and the other half will be about the wider region.

**29-32:** A traveler stops the party and asks if they are members of “that famous adventuring party, the Imperial Vanguard.” (If you have already established a rival party, use their name instead.) If the adventurers say yes, he will ask for their autographs. If the adventurers say no, he tells them “I hope that Calefa blesses you with as much fame and fortune as them!” Either way, on a Friendly reaction roll, he shares interesting city rumor. For every bard the party has hired to sing of their deeds (see encounter 09-12), there is a 1 in 6 chance the traveler asks for them instead of Imperial Vanguard.

**33-36:** 1d4 members of the City Watch (as above) march past. If the party is wearing visible weapons or armor, they will stop them and ask them to state their purpose in Cyfaraun. If the party is argumentative, or already notorious within the city, the City Watch will seek to apprehend them. If outnumbered, the Watch will whistle for back-up, drawing 2d6 additional watchmen in 1d4 rounds.

**37-40**: A pedestrian isn’t looking where he’s going. Randomly determine one party member; that character must make a Blast saving throw. If the save fails, the pedestrian bumps into him. There is a 25% chance that the pedestrian is actually a 1st level thief. Make a Pickpocketing proficiency throw; on 13+, he stole the character’s coin purse.

**41-44:** A pair of rash young patricians mounted on light riding horses are recklessly racing through the streets. Carts are being overturned, merchant stalls shattered, and bystanders knocked aside. As the riders race past, each adventurer must make a Blast saving throw. Those that fail are splattered in the face by mud and filth thrown up by the horses’ hooves. The patricians will continue for 1d10 blocks before saluting each other and splitting up to avoid the City Watch. Adventurers who apprehend the patricians and hand them over to the Watch are rewarded with 10gp for stopping public outrage. However, 1d4 nights later, they will be assailed by 2d4 hoods hired to teach them a lesson about interfering with their betters.

**Patricians (2):** Fighter 1; SPD 240’ (mounted), AC 2 (leather), HD1, hp 7, 6, #AT 1 (sword 10+), Dmg 1d6+1, Save F1, ML +1, AL N, XP 10; Proficiencies: Diplomacy, Riding; Equipment: light riding horse, military saddle, purse with 6gp and 20sp

**45-48:** 1d4 bards accompanied by a venturer (their manager) are heading to give a performance. Roll 1d10 to determine the venue: 1-3, the local emporium; 4-5, a local cantina; 6-7, a local inn; 8-9, a local tavern; 10, a patrician’s private home. On a Friendly reaction roll they will share an interesting rumor and invite the adventurers to come watch them perform.??m

**49-52:** A wild-eyed vagrant in torn rags approaches the party ranting madly. Roll 1d10. On 1-3, he warns a death cult is preying on innocent residents. On 4-6, he shouts that doppelgangers have taken control of the settlement. On 7-9, he screams that ghouls are prowling the settlement’s dark alleys. On a 10, he accuses the adventurers of misdeeds and villainy. (Whether any of these are true is for you to decide.) On a Friendly reaction roll, the vagrant can be calmed down and will share 1d3 interesting rumors.

**53-56:** An abandoned rucksack has spilled open, scattering a cache of papers onto the ground. Mud and filth have ruined much of the paper, but two items remain decipherable with a successful Deciphering throw. The first is a journal with 1d4+1 interesting rumors written in a spidery but legible hand. The second is a treasure map to a point of interest in the region (Judge’s choice).

**57-60:** A bucket of refuse is suddenly hurled out of a high-rise tenement. Each adventurer must make a Blast saving throw. Those that fail are covered in human waste. This exposes them to the bloody flux, necessitating a Death saving throw at +4 to see if they become infected. Adventurers who fail the save become symptomatic after 1d4 days and are thereafter incapacitated for a week thereafter. (Those that fail on an unmodified roll of 1 instead die gruesomely at the end of the week.) See Diseases, p. XX.

**61-64:** A friendly NPC known to the adventurers (Judge’s choice) passes right by them without any sign of acknowledgment or greeting. If the party accosts their acquaintance, roll 1d10: On 1-5, their acquaintance apologizes; he was just preoccupied with business or other matters. On 6-10, the acquaintance just offers a vague greeting (“How have you been, chief?”) and quickly excuses himself; their actual acquaintance has been slain and the party has just met the doppelgänger who assumed his identity.

**65-68**: A sewer grate has gotten blocked up, and a puddle of refuse and waste has formed around it. The smell is nauseating, even by the city’s standards. If the adventurers attempt to clear the grate, they discover it was purposefully sealed. It can be opened with a spell like *battering ram* or with one turn (10 minutes) of tool-work. It leads to a hideout, monster lair, or other point of interest.

**69-72:** Beasts of burden are rampant in the streets! Roll 1d10: On 1-3, a team of 1d4 mules is braying, kicking, and biting passersby. On 4-6, a heavy draft horse has thrown off its harness and is galloping roughshod through stalls and vendors. On 7-9, a huge ox (STR 18) has broken loose of its yoke and is stampeding across the street. On 10, an elephant imported from far-off Somirea has gone wild from the noise and smells. Adventurers who can calm the beast will be rewarded by its owner with gold equal to 20% of the cost of the animal and will learn an interesting rumor.

**73-76:** A wagon has pulled into an alleyway alongside a storefront. 2d4 laborers are unloading trade goods into the store under the supervision of the store’s owner. There are 6d100 stone of random merchandise (see ***ACKS II Revised Rulebook***p. XX). On a Friendly reaction roll, the merchant will be interested in buying or selling this type of merchandise and will share an interesting rumor.

**77-80:** A shabbily dressed man clutching a large sack darts out of an alleyway, runs past the adventurers, and ducks into another alleyway across the street. One round later, a member of the City Watch emerges from the first alleyway and halts in confusion. If the adventurers tell the watchman where the thief went, they can gain a contact in the Watch. If the adventurers mislead the watchman, the thief will surface 1d10 turns later to offer his thanks. On a Friendly reaction roll, he will offer to introduce them to his syndicate. If necessary, you can roll on the Precious Merchandise table in the ***ACKS II Revised Rulebook*** to determine the nature of the thief’s stolen goods.

**Shabbily-Dressed Man:** Thief 2; SPD 120', AC 2 (leather), HD 2, hp 6, #AT 1 (pair of daggers 9+), Dmg 1d4, Save T2, ML +2, AL N, XP 20; Special: climbing 5+, hiding 16+, listening 13+, sneaking 14+, backstabbing (+1 die); Proficiencies: Gambling, Skulking; Equipment: sack of stolen goods

**81-84:**  A patrol of legionaries from the ruler’s personal guards marches towards the adventurers. There are 10 legionaries all equipped with banded plate, spears, short swords, and shields, led by a subaltern with a crested helm. If the adventurers are known criminals, the legionaries are coming to arrest them. If the adventurers have avoided such notoriety, then the legionaries are on patrol. Adventurers who stand aside to let the guards pass can continue on to their destination. Adventurers who do not stand aside will be forcibly pushed aside by shields and spear butts. Fighting the legionaries brings 3d6 members of the City Watch in 1d4 rounds. Adventurers who are arrested will face charges of assault, mayhem, and/or murder.

**Legionaries (10):** Fighter 1; SPD 60’, AC 7 (banded plate & shield), HD 1, hp 6 each, #AT 1 (spear or short sword 10+), Dmg 1d6+1, Save F1, ML +3, AL L, XP 10; Proficiencies: Fighting Style (weapon & shield), Manual of Arms; Equipment: belt pouch with 2sp and 20cp each

**Subaltern:** Fighter 3; STR 13, CHA 13; SPD 60’, AC 8 (plate & shield), HD 3, hp 13, #AT (1 spear or short sword 8+), Dmg 1d6+3, Save F3, ML +3, AL L, XP 50; Proficiencies: Command, Fighting Style (weapon & shield), Manual of Arms; Equipment: belt pouch with 1gp and 20sp

**85-88:** A crossbow quarrel darts through the air and kills a pedestrian just a few feet away from the party. To find out what’s going on, roll 1d10. On 1-2, the adventurers were the intended target, and the assassin is about to fire again. On 3-4, the pedestrian was a murderer and slain by the Order of the Eclipse under a contract of righteous retribution. On 5-6, the pedestrian was a bard who’d been spying on the local syndicate, which had him killed. On 7-8, the pedestrian was a merchant who refused to pay protection money to the local syndicate. On 9-10, the pedestrian had been snooping around the Tower of Knowledge and was killed by a mage to keep something secret. In any case, the assassin is hidden on the rooftop above the street.

**Hidden Assassin:** Assassin 5; DEX 16; SPD 120', AC 4 (leather), HD 5, hp 23, #AT 1 (crossbow 5+ or sword and dagger 6+), Dmg 1d6+2 + poison, Save F5, ML +1, AL N, XP 200; Special: hiding 13+, sneaking 11+, backstab ×3; Proficiencies: Disguise, Intimidation, Skulking, Sniping; Equipment: 50’ rope, grappling hook, rockfish poison (onset 1 round, dmg 4d6, save+1) on crossbow bolts, belt pouch with 10gp and 20sp

**89-92:** A pair of merchants are having a heated argument. Roll 1d10. On 1-3, it’s on whether to invest in preserved meats or cloth. On 4-6, it’s on whether to dump pottery or tools. On 7-9, it’s on the price trends for salt and beer. On 10, it’s on whether to invest in rare books or semiprecious stones. If the adventurers listen to the debate for 2d10 minutes, tell them the Demand Modifiers for those types of merchandise in the settlement’s market. If the adventurers want to buy or sell the merchandise being discussed, one of the two merchants will be willing to do each (e.g. one will buy salt and sell beer, the other will sell salt and buy beer).

**93-96:** A shifty-looking couple approach the adventurers.One of them holds out a coin purse. “What’s the word on the street? We’ve got coin if you’ve got anything…interesting.” The pair are carousers (0 level characters) assigned to a carousing hijink by the local syndicate. They carry 160sp and 20gp and will pay 3d12gp per rumor the adventurers share. (Hijinks pay off at 3d12x5gp per rumor so they’re making a good margin…) If attacked, the pair try to flee and warn the Brotherhood.

**Carousers:** SPD 120’, AC 1 (padded), HD 1-1, hp 3 each, #AT 1 (dagger 11+), Dmg 1d4, Save NM, ML -1, AL N, XP 5

**97-100: 4:** A bird circles overhead, shadowing the party. The augurs teach that the flight of birds can offer an omen of things to come. Roll 1d10 to determine the species and the effects of the omen. The effects last 24 hours. On 1-3, it’s an owl (+1 to all proficiency throws). On 4-6, it’s a dove (+1 to all reaction rolls). On 7-8, it’s an eagle (+1 to all attack throws). On 9-10, it’s a raven (-1 to all saving throws). Characters with Beast Friendship can recruit the bird as a henchman with a successful reaction roll.

**101-104:** A street corner prostitute offers services to a random adventure. The prostitute has a Charisma score of 3d4+4. A few moments of pleasure costs 5cp, while a night of pleasure costs 2sp. On a Friendly reaction roll (modified by Seduction, of course), a patron might learn a city rumor. Generous tippers (3gp+) will be invited to spend time with their new friend at her bawdyhouse.

**105-108**: As the adventurers pass a nearby alleyway, they spot a corpse sprawled across the ground. Roll 1d10 to determine the culprit: On 1-2, the victim was stabbed through the heart, then decapitated. Characters with Black Lore of Zahar proficiency recognize this as the ritualistic killing practiced by Dirgion’s doombringers. On 3-4, the victim has been partly eaten. Characters with Healing proficiency who make a throw of 11+ can identify that the bite wounds are from a particular type of monster (Judge’s choice). On 5-7, the victim has had his throat cut and a bloody sigil carved into his forehead – the sign of the local syndicate. On 8-10, the victim was slain by magic. An adventurer with Sensing Power proficiency might be able to identify the spell signature of the caster who did it.

**109-112:** A skirmish after dark on the streets is taking place between members of rival crime syndicates. One syndicate is fielding a slayer, two hoods, and three footpads, while the other syndicate has a torturer, three hoods, and two footpads. If the fight is not interrupted, the first side to suffer two casualties will flee into the darkness. Adventurers who intercede on one side or the other earn the gratitude of that syndicate and can, with a Friendly reaction roll, secure an introduction with its leader. The opposing syndicate will become Hostile if any of its members escape to report the party’s deeds.

**Syndicate Slayer:** Assassin 4; STR 16, DEX 14; SPD 120', AC 3 (leather), HD 4, hp 17, #AT 1 (sword and dagger 4+ or crossbow 7+), Dmg 1d6+4 or 1d6+2, Save F4, ML +1, AL N, XP 80; Special: backstabbing (+1 die); Proficiencies: Fighting Style (two weapons), Intimidation, Sniping; Equipment: belt pouch with 4gp and 25sp

**Rival Syndicate Hoods (3):** Thief 2; SPD 120', AC 3 (leather), HD 2, hp 6 each, #AT 1 (pair of hand axes 9+), Dmg 1d6, Save T2, ML +1, AL N, XP 20; Special: backstabbing (+1 die); Proficiencies: Gambling, Swashbuckling; Equipment: belt pouch with thieves tools and 16sp each

**Rival Syndicate Footpads (2):** Thief 1; SPD 120', AC 3 (leather), HD 1, hp 3 each, #AT 1 (pair of hand axes 9+), Dmg 1d6, Save T1, ML 0, AL N, XP 10; Special: backstabbing (+1 die); Proficiencies: Gambling, Swashbuckling; Equipment: belt pouch with thieves’ tools 6sp and 20cp each

**113-116**: A patrol of the three veteran infantry and three composite bowmen from the City Watch begin ramming down the door of a building. After one round, they push inside and begin apprehending the occupants. Roll 1d10 to determine what prompted the raid: On 1, it was a chaotic cult engaging in profane rites. On 2-4, it was a brothel with 1d10 prostitutes and 1d6 patrons that didn’t pay its bribes. On 5-7, it was a gambling house with 1d3 bookies and 1d10 gamblers that cheated an officer of the watch. On 8-10, it was a warehouse of contraband with 1d4 smugglers and 3d100 stone of random merchandise. Adventurers with Lightless Vision or Shadowy Senses will notice someone skulking out unnoticed by way of a side-window…

**City Watch Veterans (3):** Fighter 1; SPD 90’, AC 5 (chain & shield), HD 1, hp 6 each, #AT 1 (spear or short sword 10+), Dmg 1d6+1, Save F1, ML +2, AL L, XP 10; Proficiencies: Alertness, Intimidation; Equipment: belt pouch with 6sp and 20cp each

**City Watch Bowmen (3):** SPD 90’, AC 4 (chain), HD 1-1, hp 4 each, #AT 1 (composite bow or sword 11+), Dmg 1d6, Save NM, ML +1, AL L, XP 5; Equipment: belt pouch with 4sp and 20cp each

**117-120** 2d4 footpads (as above) have broken into a storefront across the street and are carting trade goods onto a wagon parked in the adjacent alley. Once they have collected 6d100 stone of merchandise, they depart for a warehouse in a nearby neighborhood. If interrupted, the footpads warn the adventurers not to interfere in “syndicate business”.

**121-124:** 2d4 hoods (as above) begin shadowing the party. If the hoods outnumber the adventurers, they attempt to rob them. Otherwise they simply follow them for 1d3 turns, looking for a chance to mug a straggler or departing character.

**125-128:** Screams erupt from a nearby alleyway. A young woman is being assaulted by 1d4 local hoods (as above). The dastards are drunk, violent, and happy to fight for their “prize”. If the woman is rescued, she turns out to a patrician of exceptionally comely appearance (with CHA 18 and Seduction proficiency). She was on her way to a secret triste with her paramour, a prominent NPC. Roll 1d10 to determine her paramour: On 1-2, it’s the head of the local syndicate. On 3-4, it’s the guildmaster of the merchant guild. On 5-6, it’s the ecclesiastic head of a prominent temple. On 7-8, it’s the captain of the City Watch. On 9-10, it’s the head of the municipal council. Escorting the woman to the safety of her paramour’s residence might (on a Friendly reaction roll) earn the party the favor of the NPC in question or might lead to them being… silenced.

**129-30:** Something truly unique happens! Roll twice and combine the two events, or make up something special.

## Additional Rules for Adventures

The following rules cover a variety of circumstances that may arise when a Judge runs an adventure using ***ACKS II****.*

### Diseases

Sometimes, due to a dangerous terrain encounter, a vagary of war, or damage from a diseased monster, a character might be infected by a disease. When this occurs, the type of disease is determined with a roll of 1d100 on the Disease Type table. Certain modifiers might apply based on the context in which the exposure occurs.

Once the type of disease is determined, you must make a Death saving throw for each exposed character. Certain diseases, being less acute, offer a saving throw bonus. If the saving throw succeeds, that character avoids any serious illness. If the saving throw fails, that character becomes **infected** for the duration of the disease’s onset. He becomes **symptomatic** after the onset duration has elapsed. A symptomatic character is **incapacitated** until the disease is cured or the duration of disease expires. At the end of the duration, symptomatic characters either recover or die. If the saving throw failed on a roll of natural 1, or by the amount noted on the Disease Type table, the symptomatic character dies from the disease. Otherwise, the diseased character recovers.

A successful Healing proficiency throw on an infected character can identify that the infected character is “coming down with something” but the disease itself cannot be identified until the character is symptomatic. A successful Healing proficiency throw on a symptomatic character can identify the exact disease. A subsequent successful throw on the following day can determine the character’s prognosis (e.g. will he die or recover). A character can be cured of the disease (either by Healing proficiency or by magic) while infected or symptomatic.

|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Disease Type** | | | | | |
| **Die Roll** | **Disease Type** | **Save Bonus** | **Onset Duration** | **Symptom Duration** | **Death** |
| 5 - | Plague | 0 | 1d4 days | 1d8 days | Failed by 6+ |
| 6-15 | Putrid Fever | 0 | 2d4 days | 2 weeks | Failed by 7+ |
| 16-30 | Spotted Pox | +1 | 2d6 days | 3 weeks | Failed by 8+ |
| 31-50 | Bilious Fever | +2 | 2d6 days | 4 weeks | Failed by 8+ |
| 51-75 | Ague | +3 | 2d4 days | 1d4 weeks | Failed by 10+ |
| 76+ | Bloody Flux | +4 | 1d4 days | 1 week | Rolled Natural 1 |

EXAMPLE: A party of four 4th level fighters – Artur, Borus, Corvic, and Decimus – have just entered a jungle hex when a “dangerous terrain encounter – plague” occurs. The Judge rolls 1d100 on the Disease Type table and gets a 20; subtracting 10, because the party is in a jungle hex, the result is 10, so the disease is putrid fever. Each character must make a Death saving throw. All four have a target value of 12+. Artur rolls a 14 and avoids the illness. Borus rolls a 10. He will be infected for 2d4 days, then become symptomatic for two weeks, after which he will recover. Corvic rolls a natural 1. He will be infected for 2d4 days, then become symptomatic for two weeks, after which he will die (since he rolled a natural 1 on the save). Decimus rolls a 4. He will be infected for 2d4 days, then become symptomatic for two weeks, after which he will die (since he failed the save by 7 or more).

#### Disease Descriptions

**Plague**: Plague is a highly-feared disease characterized by grossly swollen buboes, bloody sputum, high fever, incapacitating malaise, muscle cramps, nausea, vomiting, seizures, orifical bleeding, acral necrosis, gangrene, and death. Symptoms come on after only a few days, and about 45% of patients die of the disease within a week of becoming symptomatic.

**Putrid Fever:** This ailment is characterized by high fever, incapacitating malaise, muttering delirium, rattling breath, and putrid discharges. Symptoms take about 5 days to develop. About 40% of the victims of putrid fever die within a fortnight thereafter.

**Spotted Pox:** Spotted pox is a disfiguring disease characterized by eruptive pustules all over the body, accompanied by high fever, incapacitating malaise, nausea, and vomiting. Symptoms often take a week to fully develop. 35% of patients with spotted pox die within 3 weeks of becoming symptomatic.

**Bilious Fever:** This disease is characterized by paroxysmal attacks of intense fever interspersed with sudden coldness and chills. Throughout, the patient suffers incapacitating malaise, pain, vomiting, and usually anemia and jaundice. Symptoms take about a week to fully develop. About 35% of the victims of bilious fever die within a month thereafter.

**Ague:** Ague is an ailment characterized by chills, high fever, and shivering with overall malaise. Symptoms develop within a week of infection and linger for a week to a month. About 25% of the patients die within a month of becoming symptomatic.

**Bloody Flux:** This affliction is characterized by bloody diarrhea, abdominal agony, and dehydration. Symptoms arise within a few days of exposure and last for about a week. While only about 5% of the victims of the bloody flux die, the diarrhea is so unpleasant that the other 95% usually wish they had.

### Encounter Tone

Anytime an encounter calls for a reaction roll, it is your responsibility to determine the **encounter tone** and use that to apply an appropriate set of modifiers to the reaction roll.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Encounter Reaction** | |
| **Adjusted Die Roll** | **Result** |
| 2- | Hostile, attacks |
| 3 – 5 | Unfriendly, may attack |
| 6 – 8 | Neutral, uncertain |
| 9 – 11 | Indifferent, uninterested |
| 12+ | Friendly, helpful |

There are three possible tones: **diplomatic**, **intimidating**, and **seductive**. If the entire party is surprised by an encounter, you choose either diplomatic or intimidating, whichever is worse for the party. Otherwise, the party’s spokesperson chooses the tone of interaction. If tone is unclear from the spokesperson’s statements or role-play, you can ask for clarification or decide what tone has been adopted. Once the tone of interaction is settled, you determine the appropriate modifiers to the reaction roll. Each of the three tones has a different set of modifiers applicable to it.

EXAMPLE: Morne is the acting spokesperson for a party of adventurers that has just encountered 5 orcs. He raises empty hands and says “let’s talk!” The Judge rules that this is a Diplomatic tone.

#### Diplomatic Tone

An encounter has a diplomatic tone when a spokesperson makes a non-threatening appeal to the self-interest of a target or group of targets. Calling on a guard to do his duty, asking a noble to protect his subjects, or inviting a group of strangers to parley rather than fight are all examples of the diplomatic tone. The lengthy time intervals for ongoing attempts to influence with diplomacy represent long conversations, meetings, “diplomatic summits,” and so on.

###### Diplomatic Modifiers

The following modifiers apply to diplomatic encounters.

**Alignment**Character believed to be Lawful; target is Lawful or Neutral +1
Character believed to be Lawful; target is Chaotic -1
Character believed to be Chaotic; target is Lawful or Neutral -1

**Location**Character is trespassing in target's lair -1
Character is in own lair +1

**Authority**Character has legal authority over target (lord, guard, etc.) +1 or more
Character owes target favors -1/unrequited favor
Target has authority over character -1 or more
Target owes character favors +1/unrequited favor

**Ability Scores & Proficiencies**Character has Charisma Modifier +Modifier
Character offers appropriate bribe +1 to +3

Character has Diplomacy proficiency +1
Character has Mystic Aura proficiency +1

Target has Will Modifier -Modifier

**Threat**Character is brandishing weapon -1
Target believes character has harmed friends -1
Target has witnessed or has evidence that character harmed friends -2
Target has been personally harmed by character -5 or more

**Relationship**Target is already Hostile -2
Target is already Unfriendly -1
Target is already Indifferent +1

Target is already Friendly +2

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Reaction Roll** | **Initial Reactions** | **Attempt to Influence** |
| 2 | Hostile, attacks | Shift 2 attitudes towards Hostile |
| 3-5 | Unfriendly, may attack | Shift 1 attitude towards Hostile |
| 6-8 | Neutral, uncertain | Shift 1 attitude towards Neutral |
| 9-11 | Indifferent, uninterested | Shift 1 attitude towards Friendly |
| 12 | Friendly, helpful | Shift 2 attitudes towards Friendly |

EXAMPLE: A party of 1st level adventurers has just encountered five orcs. Morne, foolishly acting as the party’s spokesperson, says “we come in peace!” This sets the tone of the encounter to diplomatic. Morne has a Charisma 7 (-1) and no relevant proficiencies.

The characters are believed to be of Lawful alignment and the target is Chaotic (-1) and the characters are trespassing in the target's lair (-1). Morne is not brandishing a weapon and the targets have no evidence that the characters harmed anyone. The total penalty is -2. The total modifier is therefore -1-2 = -3.

The Judge rolls 2d6-3, and gets an 11 on the dice. The total of (11-3) 8 results in a "Neutral" response. “If you come in peace, why'd you invade our lair?” says the orc gang leader. The party’s paladin, Tavus, now steps forward and attempts to influence the orcs. Since this is the first attempt to influence, it requires 1 round (15 – 120 seconds). The paladin decides to continue with a diplomatic tone, saying “We’ve come to work as mercenaries. We’d like to meet your chief to join his service.”

Tavus has Charisma 18 (+3) and Mystic Aura (+1), for a total bonus of +4. The same situational penalty apply, as the characters are still believed to be of Lawful alignment and the target Chaotic (-1) and the characters are still trespassing in the target’s lair (-1). The Judge therefore rolls 2d6+4-2; the dice yield an 8. This modifies to a 10, resulting in a shift in attitude by one category, from "Neutral" to "Indifferent". The orc gang leader says, “Eh, Aghrimun always was stupid, knew he'd get himself killed some day. Not sure I want to bother the chief right now, but you can go find him yourself if you want.”

The paladin decides to continue parleying. As this is a second attempt to influence, it will take 1 turn (10 rounds of interaction). His modifier is now 2d6+4-1, because he gains a +1 from the target being Indifferent. The paladin decides to make fun of Aghrimum's weakness and then says they should all go have a laugh about it with the chief. The dice yield a result of 3, modified to a 7, resulting in a shift in attitude by one category towards “Neutral.” This reverts the orcs towards Neutral. “I ain't got no interest in cracking jokes with the likes of you,” says the orc gang leader. “Get out of here before I decide I want to crack your skull.”

#### Intimidating Tone

An encounter has an intimidating tone when a spokesperson threatens to cause harm to a target or group of targets if they do not comply with his demands. Intimidation has two disadvantages and one advantage over diplomacy.

* Unlike the reactions established by diplomacy, the reactions established by intimidating interactions are temporary. A new reaction roll must be made if the adventurer encounters new allies of the intimidated creature. It should be resolved with the same roll as that used for the initial encounter with the new creatures. You can also call for a new reaction roll anytime the conditions that led to the initial intimidation have materially changed.
* Intimidation cannot achieve genuinely indifferent or friendly reactions. Instead, these are replaced with special **intimidated** and **overawed** reactions instead. Intimidated creatures will attempt to withdraw or escape at the first opportunity; if no opportunity to escape is available, they act as indifferent while they remain intimidated. Overawed creatures act as if friendly while they remain intimidated. While intimidated or overawed, creatures are treated as neutral for purposes of diplomacy or seduction.
* If adventurers inspire intimidated or overawed reactions in the targets of their intimidation, and then initiate combat against them, those reactions become conditions that affect the combat. Intimidated creatures start **faltering** while overawed creatures start the combat **frightened**.

The lengthy time intervals for ongoing attempts to influence with intimidation represent activities such as long-term brainwashing, dehumanizing treatment, and/or torture. You can limit the use of such interactions by Lawful characters if they are inappropriate to your campaign world.

###### Intimidation Modifiers

The following modifiers apply to intimidating interactions.

**Character**

Character and party members outnumber target(s) +1
Character and party members outnumber target(s) by 3:2 or more +2
Character and party members outnumber target(s) by 3:1 or more +5

**Ability Scores & Proficiencies**Character has Charisma Modifier +Modifier
Character has Intimidation proficiency and either legal authority over or outnumbers target +1
Character has Mystic Aura +1

**Relationship**Target is already Hostile -2
Target is already Unfriendly -1
Target is already Fearful +1

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Reaction Roll** | **Initial Reactions** | **Attempt to Influence** |
| 2 | Hostile, attacks | Shift 2 attitudes towards Hostile |
| 3-5 | Unfriendly, may attack | Shift 1 attitude towards Hostile |
| 6-8 | Neutral, uncertain | Shift 1 attitude towards Neutral |
| 9-11 | Intimidated, attempts to withdraw/escape if possible | Shift 1 attitude towards Overawed |
| 12 | Overawed, helpful | Shift 2 attitudes towards Overawed |

EXAMPLE: The party of 1st level adventurers has just slain the five orcs who refused to take them to their chief. Their bodies litter the floor and the adventurers' weapons are covered with orc-gore. Just then, another 10 orcs enter the room. Tavus (CHA 18, Mystic Aura, Intimidation, +5 total) steps forward. “Drop your weapons if you don't want the same to happen to you!” he says in orcish.

The characters are brandishing weapons (+1) and have some visible magic items (+1) but are not of substantially higher level and have no legal authority (0). The orcs are in their own lair (-1), are brandishing weapons (-1), and including friends in their lair outnumber the characters by more than 3:2 (-2). However, they can see that the PCs have killed some friends (+1). Their chieftain is alive, giving them ML +2 (-2). The total modifiers are +5+1+1-1-1-2+1-2 = +2.

The Judge rolls 2d6+1, and gets an 10. The adjusted total of 13 results in an “Overawed” response. The orcs drop their weapons. “We surrender!” they shout, dropping their weapons. “Take us to your chief,” the paladin orders.

The characters reach the orc chief and seek to intimidate him as well. “Time to leave these caves, chief. This place is ours now,” says Tavus. The characters are brandishing weapons (+1) and have some visible magic items (+1) but have no legal authority (0). The orc chief is in his own lair (-1), brandishing a weapon (-1), and has troops that outnumber the characters by more than 3:2 (-2). He knows that the PCs have killed some friends (+1). But he is 4HD, substantially higher level than the party (-1), has access to a witch doctor (-1), and will suffer loss of face if he submits to the adventurers (-1). With the chief alive, the orc morale is +2 (-2). The total modifiers are +5+1+1-1-1-2+1-1-1-1-2 = -1.

The Judge rolls 2d6-1 and gets a 4. The adjusted total of 3 results in an "Unfriendly" response from the chief and other new orcs in the room. “I’ll give you 10 seconds to get the hell out of my caverns, and then I start eating human-flesh,” says the Chief.

Since the adventurers have now encountered allies of the orcs they intimidated, a new interaction roll is required for those orcs. It is resolved with the same roll as that used for the initial interaction with the orc chief. Since the result was 3, that means that the currently overawed orcs have their attitudes adjusted downward by one category, from “Overawed” to “Intimidated.” They begin to slink towards the sides of the room, hoping no one pays attention to them.

Seductive Tone

An encounter has a seductive tone whenever a spokesperson appeals to a target’s prurient interest. Seductive interactions can only be used with creatures with whom it would be possible to have passionate relations (not necessarily intercourse, but at least deep emotional passion.)

The lengthy time intervals for ongoing attempts to influence with seduction represent extended periods of courtship such as private conversations, dates, social outings, cohabitation, and so on.

###### Seduction Modifiers

**Age**Character is of younger age category than target attracted to youthful mates +1/category
Character is of younger age category than target attracted to mature mates -1/category
Character is of older age category than target attracted to mature mates +1/category

Character is of older age category than target attracted to youthful mates -1/category

\*Age categories only apply within Youth to Old range.

**Status**Character has higher social status than target +1 per noble rank or equivalent
Character is significantly higher level (3+ levels) than target +1
Character is significantly lower level (3+ levels) than target -1

**Appeal**Character’s appearance, behavior, or other qualities particularly appealing to target +1 or more
Character's appearance, behavior, or other qualities particularly unappealing to target -1 or more

**Privacy**Character and target are alone +1
Characters and target are in front of target's friends -1

**Ability Scores & Proficiencies**Character has Mystic Aura proficiency +1
Character has Seduction proficiency +1

Character with Seduction or Mystic Aura proficiency also demonstrates Performance or Art proficiency +1
Target has Will Modifier -Modifier

**Relationship History**Target is already Hostile -2
Target is already Unfriendly -1
Target is already Indifferent +1
Target is already Friendly +2
Character has taken advantage of target's friends in the past -1
Character has taken advantage of target in the past -2
Target would be at personal risk from liaison with character -2 or more

**Reaction to Seduction**

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Reaction Roll** | **Initial Reactions** | **Attempt to Influence** |
| 2 | Hostile, attacks or calls for aid | Shift 2 attitudes towards Hostile |
| 3-5 | Unfriendly, insults or rejects | Shift 1 attitude towards Hostile |
| 6-8 | Neutral, remains open | Shift 1 attitude towards Neutral |
| 9-11 | Indifferent, but secretly interested | Shift 1 attitude towards Friendly |
| 12 | Friendly, helpful | Shift 2 attitudes towards Friendly |

EXAMPLE: Tavus’s party is virtually annihilated by the orc chief and his minions. The only survivor is Anja, a priestess of Ianna (CHA 16, Mystic Aura proficiency, Seduction proficiency, total modifier +4), who has been captured. As the cook-fires are being warmed, Anja says to the chief, “Don’t you want me for yourself?” and begins dancing for him using her Performance (dancing) proficiency.

Anja is younger than the orc chief, who – like many males – is attracted to youthful mates (+1). She is substantially lower level than the 4D orc chief (-1) and of lower social rank (-1). The orc chief has no particular kink for human women like Anja, but no antipathy either. Anja is attempting a seduction in front of the chief’s friends (-1). Anja has displayed a Performance proficiency (+1). The chief, having fought against the adventurers, is Hostile (-2). The modifiers from the situation add up to -3. Combined with Anja’s Charisma modifier and Seduction, the total modifier is +4-3 = +1.

The Judge rolls 2d6+1, and gets an 11, modified to a 12. The adjusted total of 12 results in a shift of 2 attitudes towards Friendly, from Hostile to Neutral. The chief says “Keep dancing and maybe I won’t cook you. Or maybe I will.”

The priestess decides to continue seducing the orc chief. As this is a second attempt to influence, it will take 1 full turn (10 rounds), during which time she continues to dance. Her modifier is now 2d6+3, because she no longer suffers the -2 penalty from the chief being hostile. The dice yield a result of 3, modified to a 6, resulting in a shift in attitude by one category towards "Neutral". The chief remains Neutral. "I’m not all that impressed,” he says.

The priestess dances as if her life depends on it in a third attempt to influence. It will take 1 hour (6 turns). Her modifier remains 2d6+3. The dice yield a 9, modified to a 12, resulting in a shift of attitude by two categories towards “Friendly”. The chief breaks out into a toothy grin. “She has endurance! I like that in a mate. Bring her over here, she’s with me.”

Several years later, the chthonic priestess Anja emerges as the head of a warband of orcs…

### Places of Power

In the worlds of heroic fantasy there lie **places of power**, where the border between the spheres is thin and magic gathers. Sometimes these are places of death, where shadows linger and undead lurk. Others are places of law and light, where divine power illuminates those who dwell within. And there are places of raw elemental power, majestic mountains, deep wells, flows of lava, where the elemental sphere hold sway.

There are six sources of power: **chaos, law**, **elemental air**, **elemental earth**, **elemental fire**, and **elemental water**. There are three ranks of power: **minor, major**, and **supreme**. The interaction of source and rank yields 18 different types of places of power, shown on the Places of Power table. The game effects of each are detailed below the table.

|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Source** | **Minor** | **Major** | **Supreme** | **Name** |
| Chaos | Shadowed | Blighted | Forsaken | Sinkhole of Evil |
| Law | Illuminated | Hallowed | Sacrosanct | Pinnacle of Good |
| Air | Gusting | Roaring | Howling | Aerie of Elemental Air |
| Earth | Resilient | Enduring | Unbreakable | Edifice of Elemental Earth |
| Fire | Smoldering | Flaming | Blazing | Furnace of Elemental Fire |
| Water | Azure | Cerulean | Ultramarine | Well of Elemental Water |

#### Sinkholes of Evil

Places corrupted by the energies of the Outer Darkness are known as **sinkholes of evil**. Profane powers and undead creatures are stronger there, while holy powers and living creatures are weakened. Sinkholes of evil can develop anywhere that death and decay predominate. Sinkholes of evil can be **shadowed**, **blighted**,or **forsaken**.The table below summarizes the effects of the various types of sinkholes of evil.

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Sinkholes of Evil** | | | |
| **Effect** | **Shadowed** | **Blighted** | **Forsaken** |
| Corruption | 1 point/season | 1 point/month | 1 point/week |
| Raises Undead | 10%/1d12 weeks | 20%/1d4 days | 80%/1d4 rounds |
| Death and Necromancy Spell Effects | +2 class levels | +2 class levels | +2 class level |
| Healing and Protection Spell Effects | No Effect | No Effect | -2 class levels |
| Rebuking Undead | No Effect | -4 class levels | Forbidden |
| Death and Necromancy Magic Research | +1 bonus | +2 bonus | +3 bonus |
| Undead in Sinkhole | No Effect | No Effect | +2 attack, save, damage, AC |
| Animating Undead | No Effect | No Effect | +2 hp/HD, 2x normal HD created |
| Blood sacrifice | Yes | Yes | Yes |

###### Shadowed Sinkholes

Shadowed sinkholes develop from two sources of corruption: Chaotic altars (such as those in evil shrines, temples, or churches) and places of death (such as cemeteries, catacombs, and battlegrounds).

Chaotic altars create shadowed sinkholes as soon as they are erected. The size of the shadowed sinkhole around the altar will be 100 square feet per 100gp spent on the altar. For instance, a 10,000gp altar would create a 100’ x 100’ shadowed sinkhole around the altar. At your discretion, meeting the gp value of the altar might require special components or blood sacrifices instead of standard treasure.

Places of death create shadowedsinkholesnaturally over time. The annual percentage chance of such an area becoming shadowed is equal to the HD of dead interred in the area divided by the area’s size in square feet, rounded up. For instance, a small 50’ x 50’ cemetery with 25 graves has a 1% chance of becoming shadowed each year. An enormous cemetery such as the real-world Wadi Al Salam (5 million dead across 64 million square feet) has an 8% chance of becoming shadowed each year. Once the shadowed sinkhole develops, the size of the shadowed sinkhole will be 100 square feet per 20 dead interred in the place. However, a sinkhole of evil will not develop if the dead are cremated by a Lawful divine spellcaster, or if one or more shrine(s) to Lawful powers are erected on the site. The Lawful shrine(s) must have a gp value of at least 5gp per dead interred in order to prevent the area from becoming shadowed.

Creatures slain in shadowed sinkholes have a 10% chance to return as undead in 1d12 weeks unless their bodies are burned. Corpses interred in shadowed sinkholes have a 10% chance to return as undead every 12 weeks. Death and necromancy spell effects are calculated as if the casters were two class levels higher than their actual level of experience. Characters engaging in research involving death or necromancy magic in a shadowed sinkhole gain a +1 bonus to their throws. A shadowed sinkhole can also be used for **blood sacrifice**.

If using the shades of magic rules (p. XX), then spending time in a corrupt place can itself cause corruption. For each season that a character resides in a shadowed sinkhole, his number of corruption points is increased by 1.

###### Blighted Sinkholes

When a chaotic altar stands on a shadowed place of death, a **blighted** sinkhole develops. The blighted sinkhole will extend only within those regions that are shadowed by both the altar and the place of death. An area affected by one, but not both, sources of corruption is merely shadowed.

Creatures slain in blighted sinkholes have a 20% chance to return as undead in 1d4 days unless their bodies are burned. Corpses interred in blighted sinkholes have a 20% chance to return as undead every 4 days. Death and necromancy spell effects are calculated as if the casters were two class levels higher than their actual level of experience. Lawful characters rebuke undead as if four class levels lower. Characters engaging in research involving death or necromancy magic gain a +2 bonus to their throws. A blighted sinkhole can be used for blood sacrifice. For each month that a character resides in a blighted sinkhole, his number of corruption points is increased by 1.

###### Forsaken Sinkholes

A blighted area might, through some awful juxtaposition of the planes or terrible ritual magic, become **forsaken**.Forsaken sinkholes are pits of darkness where the vilest creatures and foulest magic are found. Such places are very rare (Judge’s discretion).

Creatures slain in forsaken areas have an 80% chance to return as undead in 1d4 rounds unless their bodies are burned. Corpses interred in forsaken areas automatically return as undead after 1 turn. Death and necromancy spell effects are calculated as if the casters were two class levels higher than their actual level of experience. Healing and protection spell effects are calculated as if the casters were two class levels lower than their actual level of experience. Lawful characters cannot rebuke undead. Any undead in forsaken areas gain a +2 bonus to attack throws, saving throws, damage rolls, and AC. Characters engaging in research involving death or necromancy magic in a forsaken sinkhole gain a +3 bonus to their throws. Any undead created in forsaken areas gain a permanent +2 hit point per Hit Die, and **animate dead** spells cast in forsaken sinkholes create twice the normal number of Hit Dice of undead. A forsaken sinkhole can be used for blood sacrifice. For each week that a character resides in a forsaken sinkhole, his number of corruption points is increased by 1.

###### Cleansing Sinkholes

A **holy blessing** spell will temporarily decrease the effect of a sinkhole within a 100’ diameter area for the duration of the spell. While subject to **holy bless**, the affected area is cleansed if shadowed; shadowed if blighted; and blighted if forsaken. A vial of holy water can be sprinkled on a 10’ diameter area with the same effect as a **bless** spell.

To permanently cleanse a sinkhole of evil, the source of corruption must be removed. If the sinkhole is being generated by a chaotic altar, the altar must be destroyed. A chaotic altar can be destroyed magically with **dispel evil** or destroyed physically by smashing it and then either pouring holy water or casting **holy blessing** on the broken remains. This will remove the sinkhole created by the altar.

If the sinkhole is generated by a place of death, the sinkhole can be instantly cleansed with **dispel evil**. However,the area will eventually become shadowed again over time. To permanently cleanse a sinkhole created by a place of death, a Lawful divine spellcaster must cremate the dead interred therein, or erect a shrine to the Lawful powers of appropriate value.

Cleansing a blighted sinkhole, with a chaotic altar standing on a place of death, requires that both sources of corruption be dealt with separately.

A forsaken sinkhole can only be cleansed by ritual magic. As such areas develop very rarely, the magic to cleanse them is almost always forgotten in between each such occurrence, and must be researched anew by the forces of Law.

Sometimes the Lawful powers will reward adventurers who cleanse sinkholes with bonus XP. Such rewards are at your discretion based on the importance of the sinkhole and the difficulty to cleanse it.

#### Pinnacles of Good

Places of beauty and serenity, respites from the chaos and corruption of the world around them, are known as **pinnacles of good**. The forces of life are stronger there, while dark forces are kept at bay. Light is brighter, sounds are crisper, and colors more vivid; harmony and a sense of order prevail. Pinnacles of good can be **illuminated,** **hallowed**, or **sacrosanct**.The table below summarizes the effects of the various types:

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Pinnacles of Good** | | | |
| **Effect** | **Illuminated** | **Hallowed** | **Sacrosanct** |
| Purification of Corruption | 1 point/season | 1/month | 1/week |
| Healing and Protection Spell Effects | +2 class levels | +2 class levels | +2 class level |
| Death and Necromancy Spell Effects | No Effect | No Effect | -2 class levels |
| Rebuking Undead | No Effect | +4 class levels | Automatic |
| Protection Magic Research | +1 bonus | +2 bonus | +3 bonus |
| Natural Healing | +1 hp / day | +2 hp / day | +4 hp / day |
| Recovery from Enervation | +1 bonus | +2 bonus | +4 bonus |

###### Illuminated Pinnacles

Illuminated pinnacles develop from two sources: Lawful altars (such as those in lawful shrines, temples, or churches) and the dwelling places of powerful good creatures.

Lawful altars create illuminated pinnacles as soon as they are erected. The size of the illuminated pinnacle around the altar will be 100 square feet per 100gp spent on the altar. For instance, a 10,000gp altar would create a 100’ x 100’ illuminated pinnacles around the altar. At you discretion, meeting the gp value of the altar might require special components or divine power instead of standard treasure.

Powerful good creatures create illuminated pinnaclesnaturally over time through their presence. For these purposes, “powerful good creatures” include: enchanted creatures of lawful alignment; lawful spellcasters of any level; and 2nd level or higher characters of a lawful class such as paladin. The creature(s) must reside in a particular place more-or-less continuously for a year for a place to become illuminated. The annual percentage chance of a good creature’s dwelling place becoming illuminated is equal to the HD value of the good creatures residing there divided by the area’s size in square feet, rounded up. Once the Illuminated pinnacle develops, the entire area will be illuminated. You must use your discretion in determining what constitutes a creature’s dwelling place. It might be, e.g., a treant’s grove of trees, a unicorn’s garden, or a patriarch’s high temple.

EXAMPLE: The giant roc Majid (36 HD) dwells in a 50’ x 50’ aerie at the top of a high peak. The Judge decides the aerie constitutes the roc’s dwelling place. Each year, the chance of Majid’s aerie becoming illuminated is (36 / 2,500 = .014) 2%.

Characters resting within an illuminated pinnacle recover from wounds more quickly. While within the pinnacle, the character heals 1 additional hp for each day of rest and gains a +1 bonus to recover from being **enervated**. Healing and protection spell effects are calculated as if the casters were two class levels higher than their actual level of experience. Lawful characters engaging in research involving healing or protection magicin an illuminated pinnacle gain a +1 bonus to their throws.

Finally, the serenity of a pinnacle of good can remove the stain of corruption from a character, provided the character’s corruption has not advanced too far. If using the shades of magic rules (p. XX), then for each season that a lawful or neutral character resides in an illuminated pinnacle, his number of corruption points is reduced by 1.

###### Hallowed Pinnacle

When a lawful altar is built in an illuminated dwelling place of good, a **hallowed** pinnacle develops. The hallowed pinnacle will extend only within those parts of the dwelling place that are illuminated by the altar. An area affected by one, but not both, sources of good is merely illuminated.

While within a hallowed pinnacle, the character heals 2 additional hp for each day of rest and gains a +2 bonus to recover from being **enervated**. Healing and protection spell effects are calculated as if the casters were two class levels higher than their actual level of experience. Lawful characters capable of rebuking undead do so as if four class levels higher. Lawful characters engaging in research involving healing or protection magic in a hallowed pinnacle gain a +2 bonus to their throws. Finally, for each month that a lawful or neutral character resides in a hallowed pinnacle, his number of corruption points is reduced by 1.

###### Sacrosanct Pinnacle

A hallowed area might, through some fortunate juxtaposition of the planes or miraculous ritual, become **sacrosanct**.Sacrosanct pinnacles are transcendent regions of law and power. Such places are very rare (Judge’s discretion).

While within a sacrosanct pinnacle, the character heals 4 additional hp for each day of rest and gains a +4 bonus to recover from being **enervated**. Healing and protection spell effects are calculated as if the casters were two class levels higher than their actual level of experience. Lawful characters capable of rebuking undead automatically turn undead encountered there (earning an R result if a roll would normally be required, and a D result otherwise). Lawful characters engaging in research involving healing and protection magic in the sacrosanct pinnacle gain a +3 bonus to their throws. Death and necromancy spell effects are calculated as if the casters were two class levels lower than their actual level of experience. Finally, for each week that a lawful or neutral character resides in a sacrosanct pinnacle, his number of corruption points is reduced by 1.

###### Depurifying Pinnacles

A *bane*spell will temporarily decrease the effect of a pinnacle within a 100’ diameter area for the duration of the spell. While subject to *bane*, the affected area is regular if illuminated; illuminated if hallowed; and hallowed if sacrosanct. A vial of unholy water can be sprinkled on a 10’ diameter area with the same effect as a *bane*spell.

To permanently destroy a pinnacle of good, the source of purity must be removed. If the pinnacle is being generated by a lawful altar, the altar must be destroyed. A lawful altar can be destroyed magically, with *dispel good*; or destroyed physically by smashing it and then either pouring unholy water or casting *bane*on the broken remains. This will remove the pinnacle created by the altar.

If the pinnacle is generated by the residence of good creatures, the pinnacle can be instantly depurified with *dispel good*. However,the area will eventually become illuminated again over time. To permanently depurify a pinnacle created by good creatures, the creatures must be slain or driven off.

Depurifying a hallowed pinnacle requires that both sources of purity be dealt with separately. A sacrosanct pinnacle can only be depurified by ritual magic. As such areas develop very rarely, the magic to cleanse them is almost always forgotten in between each such occurrence, and must be researched anew by the forces of Chaos.

#### Places of Elemental Power

Many places of power are created by the influence of the elemental spheres of air, earth, fire, and water. Elemental places of power develop naturally, in areas which are shaped or influenced by the elements. Each of the elementals has its own type of place: aeries of elemental air, edifices of elemental earth, furnaces of elemental fire, and wells of elemental water. The table below summarizes the effects of the various ranks of elemental places of power.

Places of elemental power develop in places of sublime elemental majesty. Places of sublime elemental majesty occur naturally in the wilderness. Real-life examples might include God’s Window in South Africa (air), the Wind Cathedral in Namibia (air), Maruyama Caldera in Aogashima (fire), the Door to Hell in Turkmenistan (fire), the Cave of the Crystals in Mexico (earth), the Giant’s Causeway in Ireland (earth), the Fairy Pools on the Isle of Skye (water), and the Great Blue Hole off Belize (water).

Places of elemental power should be rare. Of the 165 lairs in ***Lairs & Encounters****,* only 6 included elemental places of power, and all were minor. On a continental map (1,200 24-mile hexes), you should place 1 supreme and 12 major elemental places of power of each element. On a regional map (1,200 6-mile hexes), you should place 1 major and 12 minor elemental places of power for each element.

The size of places of elemental power can vary widely. To determine randomly, roll 1d6: 1-3, Small, 3d6 x 500 square feet; 4-5, Large, 3d6 x 50,000 square feet; 6, Huge, 3d6 x 5,000,000 square feet.

**Designer’s Note**: The Judge may wonder how we decided how many places of elemental power there are in the world. On our own Earth, there are 11 naturally-burning eternal flames, 600 active volcanoes, and 1000 active geysers in the world - that suggests 1,611 places of elemental fire spread across the earth’s 5,300,000 square mile land mass. That’s one place of elemental fire per 3,295 square miles. Since each 6-mile hex is 32 square miles, that’s one place of elemental fire per 102 hexes, or about 12 places on a typical 1,200-hex regional map.

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Places of Elemental Power** | | | |
| **Effect** | **Minor** | **Major** | **Supreme** |
| Elemental Incursion | 10%/1d12 days/1d4 days | 20%/1d12 days/1d4 weeks | 80%/1d12 days/Permanent |
| Elemental Spell Effects | +2 class levels | +2 class levels | +2 class level |
| Other Elemental Spell Effects | No Effect | No Effect | -2 class levels |
| Elemental Magic Research | +1 bonus | +2 bonus | +3 bonus |
| Elementals in Sinkhole | No Effect | No Effect | +2 attack, save, damage, AC |
| Conjured/Summoned Elementals | No Effect | No Effect | +2 hp/HD, 2x normal HD created |

###### Minor Places of Elemental Power

Characters within the place who perform magical research of the place’s element gain a +1 bonus to their throws. Spell effects of the place’s element are calculated as if the casters were two class levels higher than their actual level of experience. If the place is left unoccupied, there is a 10% chance every 1d12 days that a group of creatures native to that element’s sphere will manifest in the place. These creatures will return to their sphere of existence after 1d4 days have elapsed. There is a 3% chance such a group is already present when a minor place of elemental power is discovered or visited by adventurers.

###### Major Places of Elemental Power

Characters within the place who perform magical research of the place’s element gain a +2 bonus to their throws. Spell effects of the place’s element are calculated as if the casters were two class levels higher than their actual level of experience. If the place is left unoccupied, there is a 20% chance every 1d12 days that a group of elemental creatures of the place’s type will manifest in the place. These creatures will return to their sphere of existence after 1d4 weeks have elapsed. There is a 45% chance such a group is already present when a major place of elemental power is discovered or visited by adventurers.

###### Supreme Places of Elemental Power

Characters within the place who perform magical research of the place’s element gain a +3 bonus to their throws. Spell effects of the place’s element are calculated as if the casters were two class levels higher than their actual level of experience. Spell effects of any other elements are calculated as if the casters were two class levels lower than their actual level of experience. While in a supreme place of elemental power, creatures native to that element’s sphere gain a +2 bonus to attack throws, saving throws, damage rolls, and AC. Summoning spells cast in places of supreme elemental power summon twice the normal number of Hit Dice of elementals of that type, and the summoned elementals will have +2 hit point per Hit Die. If the place is left unoccupied, there is an 80% chance every 1d12 days that a group of elemental creatures of the place’s type will manifest in the place. These creatures will not return to their sphere of existence until **dispelled** or destroyed. There will always be such a group present when a supreme place of elemental power is discovered or visited by adventurers.

#### Ley Lines (Optional)

In some settings, the world is not just arbitrarily dotted with places of power, it is crisscrossed with currents of magical energy known as **ley lines** which create the places of power. Like places of power, ley lines have a source and rank of power. The source can be chaotic, lawful, or any element. The rank of power can be trivial, minor or major, but not supreme. The rank of power determines the width, length, and effect of the ley line.

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Ley Lines** | | | |
| **Rank** | **Typical Width** | **Typical Length** | **Effect** |
| Trivial | 1d6! x 10’ wide | 60 miles (10 6-mile hexes) | No effect except to create places of power at intersections |
| Minor | 1d6! x 100’ wide | 240 miles (40 6-mile hexes) | As minor place of power of that source |
| Major | 1d6! x 1000’ wide | 960 miles (160 6-mile hexes) | As major place of power of that source |

When ley lines of the same source intersect, they create places of power at their intersections, as shown on the Ley Line Intersections of Same Source table. When ley lines of opposing sources (chaos vs. law, water vs. fire, or earth vs. air) interact, they reduce or terminate their ranks, as shown on the Ley Line Intersection of Opposing Sources table.

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Ley Line Intersections of Same Source** | | | |  | **Ley Line Intersections of Opposing Source** | | | |
| **Rank** | **Trivial** | **Minor** | **Major** |  | **Rank** | **Trivial** | **Minor** | **Major** |
| Trivial | Minor | Minor | Major |  | Trivial | Both end | Trivial ends | Trivial ends |
| Minor | Minor | Major | Major |  | Minor | Trivial ends | Both become Trivial | Maj. becomes Min., Min. ends |
| Major | Minor | Major | Supreme |  | Major | Trivial ends | Maj. becomes Min., Min. ends | Both become Minor |

### Poisons

Many monsters have deadly natural poisons. If you permit, other characters or monsters can use poison. Poisons can be acquired from three sources: monster venoms, plant toxins, or magical poisons. At your discretion, certain markets may also sell monster venoms, plant toxins, and magical poisons, so gp costs are listed below for each type of poison.

#### Monster Venoms

Characters with Naturalism proficiency can identify venomous monsters and distinguish their different poisons with a successful proficiency throw of 11+. Extracting venom from a slain monster requires 1 hour of ancillary activity and a successful Animal Husbandry proficiency throw of 18+. The character gains a +4 bonus to the throw per additional rank of Animal Husbandry. If the throw fails, the character can try again. If the character’s proficiency throw to extract venom is an unmodified 1, he has accidentally gotten scratched by a fang or stinger. The character must immediately save versus Poison, as if hit by the monster.

Once extracted, monster venoms can be applied to weapons. Each monster yields one dose of its venom. A dose is enough venom to treat twenty arrows or bolts, five darts, or one melee weapon. Note that venoms applied to missiles and melee weapons are not as effective as they are when coming from the monster itself. Venomous monsters penetrate their prey’s skin with hollow fangs or tubular stingers, then use muscles attached to their venom reservoirs to forcibly squirt venom deep within the target’s body tissue. In comparison, a sword or arrow is simply a less effective mechanism for delivering poison.

The Monster Venoms table shows the market cost, onset time, save modifier, and effects of monster venoms when applied to missiles and melee weapons. An onset time of instant means the poison takes effect at the end of the attacker’s initiative. An onset time of “one round” means the poison takes effect at the end of the round following the target’s next initiative (e.g. the target gets to act once before the poison affects him).

|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Monster Venoms** | **Onset Time** | **Save Modifier** | **Effect on Failed Save** | **Cost** |
| Giant Centipede | 1 turn | +2 | **Incapacitation**, 1d10 turns | 50gp |
| Giant Killer Bee | 1 turn | +2 | 1d4 poisonous damage | 75gp |
| Spitting Cobra | 1 turn | +2 | 1d6 poisonous damage | 100gp |
| Giant Crab Spider | 1d8 turns | +4 | 2d6 poisonous damage | 100gp |
| Pit Viper | 1d10 turn | +2 | 2d6 poisonous damage | 125gp |
| Foul Attercop | 1 turn | +6 | **Paralysis** 1d4 turns + 1d6 poisonous damage | 125gp |
| Sea Snake | 1d10 turn | +2 | 4d4 poisonous damage | 200gp |
| Rattlesnake | 1d10 turn | +2 | 4d6 poisonous damage | 250gp |
| Black Widow | 1d4 turns | +2 | 4d4 poisonous damage | 250gp |
| Hideous Attercop | 1 turn | +4 | **Paralysis** 1d4 turns + 1d8 poisonous damage | 250gp |
| Carrion Horror | 1 turn | +2 | **Paralysis** 2d4 turns | 300gp |
| Monstrous Attercop | 1 turn | 0 | **Paralysis** 1d4 turns + 2d6 poisonous damage | 325gp |
| Arane | 1d8 turn | +1 | 6d6 poisonous damage | 350gp |
| Giant Tarantula | 1d4 turns | +2 | 3d10 poisonous damage | 375gp |
| Giant Rockfish | 1 round | +1 | 5d6 poisonous damage | 450gp |
| Wyvern | 1 round | +1 | 7d6 poisonous damage | 600gp |
| Skittering Maw | 1 round | +1 | 8d6 poisonous damage | 700gp |
| Rakshasa | 1 round | +1 | 10d6 poisonous damage | 800gp |
| Demonic Attercop | 1 round | 0 | **Paralysis** 1d4 turns + 5d6 poisonous damage | 1,000 gp |
| Giant Constricting Viper | Instant/1d4+2 turns | 0 | **Madness** / Death | 1,000gp |
| Giant Black Worm | Instant | 0 | Death | 1,500 gp |
| Dragon | Instant | 0 | Death | 1,500gp |

#### Plant Toxins

Characters with Naturalism proficiency can search for a fresh specimen of poisonous plants by allocating 1 day of dedicated activity. A successful proficiency throw against the target value for the plant (listed on the Plant Toxins table below) gathers enough fresh plant to extract one dose of toxin. The character gains a +4 bonus to the throw per additional rank of Naturalism. The character suffers a -4 penalty to the proficiency throw in civilized territory, but gains a +2 bonus in outlands territory, and +4 in unsettled territory. Dried belladonna and wolfsbane can be easily found in most markets, but are more difficult to extract useful toxin from.

Extracting the toxin from the raw plant takes 1 day of dedicated activity per plant and requires a successful Alchemy proficiency throw of 20+. The character gains a +4 bonus to the throw per additional rank of Alchemy but suffers a -4 penalty if using dried plants. If either the proficiency throw to gather the plant, or to extract the plant toxin, is an unmodified 1, the character has accidentally exposed himself to the toxin. The character must immediately save versus Poison or suffer its effects.

Each plant yields one dose of its toxin. Some plant toxins can be used to treat weapons. For these toxins, a dose is enough to treat twenty arrows or bolts, five darts, or one melee weapon.. Other toxins can be used to poison food or drink. In this case, one dose is enough to poison one meal or drink. Extracted plant toxins generally cannot be detected by smell or taste. The Plant Toxins table shows the market cost, onset time, save modifier of the various plant toxins.

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Plant Toxins** | **Forage Throw** |  | **Onset Time** | **Save Modifier** | **Effect on Failed Save** | **Cost** |
| Belladonna | 11+ |  | 1 turn (injury)  1d3 turns (ingestion) | +2 | 2d8 damage and **madness** 1d4 turns | 350gp |
| Curare | 19+ |  | Instant (injury) | 0 | 2d12 damage and **paralysis** 2d4 turns | 1,500gp |
| Foxglove | 14+ |  | 1d6 turns (ingestion) | -3 | 2d8 damage and **madness** 1d4 turns | 150gp |
| Hellebore | 8+ |  | 1 turn (injury)  1d3 turns (ingestion) | +2 | 1d6 damage and **queasy** 1d10 days | 100gp |
| Hemlock | 8+ |  | 2d4 turns (ingestion) | +4 | 2d12 damage and **queasy** 1d10 days | 75gp |
| Henbane | 8+ |  | 1 turn (injury)  1d6 turns (ingestion) | +2 | 1d6 damage and **madness** 1d4 hours | 80g; |
| Wolfsbane | 11+ |  | 1 turn (injury)  2d4 turns (ingestion) | +2 | 2d8 damage and **paralysis** 2d4 turns | 325gp |
| Yew | 4+ |  | 1 hour (injury)  1d6 hours (ingestion) | +4 | 1d10 damage | 65gp |

#### Magical Poisons

Magical poisons are created using the rules for magic research. The most common magical poison is a **poison potion**, created using the 4th level reversed divine spell **poison**. A single **poison potion** can treat twenty missiles (arrows, bolts, or darts) or one melee weapon. A weapon treated with magical **poison** kills instantly unless the victim makes a successful saving throw versus Poison. Magical **poison** is also fatal if ingested.

#### Use of Poison

Once applied, poison evaporates quickly, diminishing its effectiveness. On the first day, it will do full damage, on the second day half damage, and by the third it will be gone. Partially evaporated deadly poisons allow the victim a +2 bonus on his saving throw after the first day, and +4 after the second. Each hit with a melee weapon is equivalent to a day’s evaporation, e.g. the poison will do half damage on its second hit and then be gone.

Using poisoned weapons is not without risk. Whenever a character’s attack throw with a poisoned weapon is an unmodified 1, he has accidentally pricked himself. He must immediately save versus Poison or suffer its effects.

### Proficiency Throws

From time to time, adventurers might attempt to use their Adventuring proficiency, or other proficiencies, in ways that are not otherwise covered by the game mechanics. A legacy mechanic that Judges often turn to in such situations is to ask the adventurer to make an “attribute check” by rolling 1d20 and comparing the result to one of his attributes, with a roll of equal to or less than the attribute resulting in success. However, we do not recommended that you use this method for ***ACKS II***, as it makes attributes much more important than they are in the rest of the game system.

Instead we suggest you use a proficiency throw, sometimes modified by an attribute, with a target value defined using the guidelines below. Target values separated by a slash indicate that additional ranks in a relevant proficiency make the task easier. These are just guidelines so feel free to modify them as you deem necessary for your game’s balance and playability.

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Action** | **Target Value** | **Attribute Modifier** | **Other Rules** |
| Largely a matter of luck | 11+ | None | None |
| Test of raw ability | 18+ | 4 x attribute modifier | None |
| Routine and safe | 4+/2+/2+ | None | None |
| Routine and dangerous | 8+/4+/2+ | None | Fumble on unmodified 1 |
| Requires careful recall of training | 11+/7+/4+ | None | None |
| Difficult, safe task | 14+/11+/7+ | None | None |
| Difficult, dangerous task | 18+/14+/10+ | None | Fumble on unmodified 1 or 1-3 |

EXAMPLE: Atreideus has been captured by a prophetic witch, who has forced him to shove his hand into her magical hearth-fire. The hearth-fire is enchanted such that if Atreideus cries out or withdraws his hand from the pain of the burns, he will be instantly slain. What is the appropriate target value for this throw? Looking at the table, the Judge decides this is a test of raw ability using Atreideus’s Will attribute with a target value of 18+. Fortunately, Atreideus has a Will of 18, so he gets a +12 bonus and only needs to roll a 6+. Unfortunately, he rolls a 5 and is slain. The witch, somewhat annoyed, mutters to herself about how hard it is to find a chosen one these days.

### Transformations

In some circumstances, e.g. infection with lycanthropy, magical crossbreeding, or necromantic ritual, an adventurer might be transformed into an intelligent monster. With your permission, the player can continue to play his character in its new form.

#### Transformed Characteristics

The transformed character gains all the characteristics associated with its new monstrous form, including forms of movement and speeds, natural armor, natural attacks, extraordinary abilities, listed proficiencies, and the like. If the monster’s Hit Dice are below the character’s former class level, its Hit Dice should be increased to the character’s former class level. If the character’s class level was equal to or below the monster’s HD, he gains the monster’s HD.

#### Attributes, Sex, Age, and Appearance

The transformed character retains all of his attributes; a strong man who is transformed into a chimera becomes a strong chimera. A stupid elf transformed into a mummy becomes a stupid mummy. The effect of attributes on monsters is described in the ***ACKS II******Monstrous Manual***p. XX – XX.

If transformed into a monster that has multiple sexes, the transformed character preserves his sex, or closest approximation to it. If transformed into a monster that ages, the transformed character’s age is re-calculated so that he stays in the same age category at the same approximate point in his lifespan. The transformed character preserves his variance in height and weight, relative to his new form, in proportion to that of his original form.

EXAMPLE: Rollio is a 70-year old human male of exceptional height (6’6”). He is transformed into a small roc. Rocs have the same sexes as humans, so Rollio preserves his male sex. As a 70-year old human, Rollio is currently in the Old age category with a maximum lifespan of 95 years. An Old small roc is between 60 and 90 years, with a maximum lifespan of 120 years. The Judge decides that Rollio is an 85-year old small roc. Since Rollio is about 15% taller than a typical man, he transforms into a small roc with a wingspan about 15% larger than typical.

#### Class Powers, Racial Abilities, and Proficiencies

If the transformed character possesses the After the Flesh class power, and is transformed into an undead, the character retains all of his class powers and racial abilities.

If the transformed character is turned into a lycanthrope, and his class level was greater than the HD of an ordinary lycanthrope, he retains his class powers. (Only humans can become lycanthropes, so there are no racial abilities to preserve.)

Otherwise, the transformed character might, but does not always, retain its class abilities. The character must make a Spells saving throw when the transformation is complete. If the save succeeds, the caster retains his class abilities; if the save fails, he loses them permanently. He does not retain racial abilities in either case.

Transformed characters retain any weapon, armor, fighting style, and general proficiencies they possessed in their original form. Depending on their new form, the retained proficiencies might be of greater or lesser utility. Characters with armor proficiency can wear barding. Characters with Mounted Combat or Riding proficiency transformed into rideable monsters have the ability to serve as war mounts. Transformed characters lose all class proficiencies unless they retained their class powers.

EXAMPLE: Prior to his transformation, Rollio was a fighter (though long retired) with the standard compliment of proficiencies, including Alertness, Combat Reflexes, Riding, and Military Strategy 3. Unfortunately, when he was transformed into a small roc, he failed his Spells save. Therefore, he loses his fighter damage bonus and his two class proficiencies (Alertness and Combat Reflexes). He retains all of the other general proficiencies he possessed. His avian form prevents him from using swords, bows, or other weapons, so those proficiencies have no utility to him. However, his proficiency in heavy armor remains useful, as he can now wear barding. His Riding proficiency enables him to serve as a war mount. His Military Strategy proficiency is as valuable as ever, or perhaps more valuable, as now he can command from the air!

Transformed characters can receive training as guards or war mounts by monster trainers if desired.

#### Advancement as a Monster

A character transformed into a monster may increase in HD through adventuring and campaign activities. It requires 3,000 XP plus 500 XP per special ability (\*) for a 1 HD monster to advance to 2 HD. The amount of XP required doubles with each HD (round values greater than 20,000 XP to the nearest 1,000 and values greater than 40,000 XP to the nearest 5,000). Characters who retain their class abilities must pay for additional special abilities (\*). Retaining barbarian, fighter, or paladin abilities does not add any special abilities. Retaining bladedancer, crusader, explorer, shaman, thief, venturer, or zaharan ruinguard abilities adds one \*. Retaining craftpriest, mage, nightblade, priestess, spellsword, warlock, or witch abilities adds two \*\*. Retaining wonderworker abilities add three \*\*\*.

**Designer’s Note:** For custom classes, the number of special abilities the class abilities are worth is determined by tallying up its build points. Add 1/2 its build points in the Arcane, Divine, or other magic type values; 1/3 its build points in the Thievery value; and 1/3 its build points in any racial values that don’t improve spellcasting. Don’t add any for its HD or Fighting value. If the transformation didn’t permit the character to retain some class abilities, don’t count those build points. See **Custom Classes** on p. XX – p. XX.

As his Hit Dice increase, the transformed character’s class abilities will increase based on his prior class’s progression, subject to the class’s maximum level.

EXAMPLE: Quintus, a 7th level mage, is the victim of a necromantic ritual that transforms him into a mummy. He gains the mummy’s movement, armor class, attacks, damage, and special abilities, including mummy rot, immunities, and fearsome aura. A mummy has only 5+1 HD, which is below Quintus’s class level. Therefore his Hit Dice are raised to 7. Quintus succeeds on his Spells save, so he retains his class abilities; as a mage, those are worth \*\*. Meanwhile, a mummy’s powers are considered two special abilities (\*\*), so Quintus is considered to have four special abilities total, or 7 HD\*\*\*\*. The Judge counts the XP progression for advancement (2 HD at 5,000 XP, 3 HD at 10,000, 4 HD at 20,000, 5 HD at 40,000, 6 HD at 80,000, 7 HD at 160,000, 8 HD at 320,000). Quintus will need 320,000 XP to reach level 8.

#### Transformed Alignment and Behavior

Transformed characters often gain new – and lose old – appetites, emotions, and perspectives. They are, in every way that counts, different persons. Even if they are initially able to retain their sense of self, the transformed characters will generally find themselves being treated very differently in their new form. These factors make it likely that, over time, most transformed characters begin to follow the alignment and behavior of their new form. Divine spellcasters who change alignment generally must find a new god to serve.

However, great-souled and strong willed characters might have a chance to retain their old personality. Upon first being transformed, and each time the character advances in age category or HD in his new form, the transformed character must make a Death saving throw. If the save succeeds, he is able to retain his prior alignment and personality. If the save fails, the character takes on the alignment and personality of the monster he has become.

There are two exceptions to this rule:

* A character transformed into a lycanthrope can automatically retain his alignment and personality provided he rejects rather than embraces his lycanthropy. Such a character cannot control when he transforms nor his actions while in beast form, but retains his morality and outlook when in his human form. See the ***ACKS II******Monstrous Manual***p. XX).
* A character with the After the Flesh class power who is transformed into an undead can automatically retain his alignment and behavior. Such characters are usually already malign sorts of Chaotic alignment, though.

EXAMPLE: Quintus has just been transformed into a mummy. As a human, Quintus was an argumentative but genial fellow of Lawful alignment, a lover of long debate and intricate plans. Upon being transformed, he must make a Death saving throw. He succeeds, and thereby retains his alignment and personality. Through magic research, seeking to restore his humanity, he advances in HD to 8 HD. He must now make another Death saving throw. This time, the throw fails. Quintus becomes Chaotic and his human personality withers away as he cares no longer for the petty squabbles and machinations of mortals.

# Chapter 3: Campaigns

Ongoing ***ACKS***campaign tend towards a consistent but informal pace of around one adventure per game month. The month begins with the adventurers in a civilized area, from which they set off on an adventure. During the adventure, they suffer casualties and discover treasure, then return to civilization. They then rest for a few weeks to recover from their injuries, investigate the properties of their magical treasure, hire new recruits, etc. At higher levels, they also manage their domains, run their syndicates, or perform magical research during this time.

Just adventuring needs an initiative sequence to order play and an action system to guide what can be accomplished in a round, campaign play needs a campaign sequence to order play and an activities system to guide what can be accomplished in a day. Can a character recruit mercenaries while soliciting merchants? Can a character sell goods while training troops? How many henchmen can be recruited in a day? If a character can force march to travel 50% further, can he work overtime to do 50% more blood sacrifices in a day? Does expenditure on magical research occur before or after revenue is collected? These Campaign Play rules provide you a structure with which campaign activities each month can be handled as systematically as ***ACKS***handles actions every combat round and exploration every turn.

## Using the Campaign Rules

There are three broad ways that you can make use of the campaign rules. First, you can simply treat them as rules of thumb or guidelines for activities that you otherwise handle in a narrative fashion. This is a good option for low-level campaigns, where the PCs are spending the majority of their time dungeon-crawling, the range of campaign play activities open to the PCs is limited, and the time horizon of game play is short.

Second, you can implement the Campaign Play rules in full but behind-the-scenes. With this option, it becomes your responsibility to translate the various choices that the players describe into the appropriate activities undertaken by their characters. For instance, if a player says “since we have a few weeks to kill while Marcus recuperates, I’d like to spend the time holding court for my domain, giving the peasants a chance to air their grievances,” you can translate that into the Administering Domain activity. This can be a very immersive experience for the players, but puts the onus on you to track and manage all the complexities of the system. It is a good choice for mid-level campaigns, where the PCs are still predominantly focused on adventuring but do have the opportunity to explore a range of downtime activities.

Third, you can share the Campaign Play rules with the players, with an invitation for them to master the complexities of the system and decide what specific in-game activities they would like to do in each game day, week, and month. This method allows ***ACKS***to be run in a wargame-like fashion, and is ideal for high level campaigns with significant domain play and possible player-versus-player action in “patron play.” It can even be used for 1:1 timekeeping play in distributed campaigns.

Don’t let yourself get overwhelmed by these rules. They’re there if you need them, not there because you must use them from session 1. In general, we believe it’s easier to ignore a sub-system you don’t need at the moment then to create a sub-system you do need in the moment. So remember the guiding philosophy of ***ACKS***- every campaign is a law unto itself – and get some campaign play going!

## Sequence of Play (Campaigns)

Campaign play is divided into time increments of **game months**. Each month you should follow the procedure below:

1. Start of Month stage
   1. Random Events phase
   2. Investment phase
   3. Tribute Payment phase
2. Campaign Activities stage
   1. First Week phase
   2. Second Week phase
   3. Third Week phase
   4. Fourth Week phase
   5. Fifth Week phase
3. End of Month stage
   1. Congregant Growth
   2. Expense Payment phase
   3. Revenue Collection
   4. Domain Growth
   5. Domain Morale phase

Don’t feel beholden to following this sequence strictly. Sometimes you might want to distribute growth, revenue, and expenses across the month as a whole, rather than at the start and end of the month. Because this involves more calculation and record-keeping, it is not usually worthwhile, but might be needed in extraordinary cases. For instance, if a *cataclysm* will destroy a PC’s domain on the 15th day of a month, it might make sense to closely track revenue and expenses per day! We reiterate that the sequence of play is intended to be a framework to help you simulate a living world, not a prison that forces your campaign into absurd situations.

### Start of Month Stage

This stage occurs at the beginning of every game month. It consists of two phases, Random Events and Investment.

1. **Random Events:** During this phase, each PC ruler adjudicates any various random events that might occur. The Random Events phase has the following sub-phases:
   1. *Favors and Duties:* Roll for Favors and Duties imposed by NPC lords on PC vassals.
   2. *Vagaries of Investment:* Roll for Vagaries of Investment for each mercantile investment made by the PCs.
   3. *Vagaries of Recruitment:* Roll for Vagaries of Recruitment for each domain whose ruler is calling up vassal troops, conscripting peasants, hiring mercenaries from his realm, or levying militia this month.
   4. *Event Allocation:* For each random event scheduled to occur this month, choose or roll to determine which week it will take place in this month.
2. **Investments:** During this phase, each PC ruler can make agricultural or urban investments or land improvements. Each PC can also make passive investments (see p. XX). Investments that were made during role-play in the prior month also take effect now.

### Campaign Activities Stage

Most action in an ongoing ***ACKS***campaign happens during the campaign activities stage, which can include dungeon delving, wilderness travel, magical research, and more. Four phases occur during the Campaign Activities phase, during which these events are resolved.

1. **First Week:** During this phase, each character in the campaign can undertake up to seven days’ worth of campaign activities. There are nine sub-phases in the First Week phase:
   1. *Vagaries of War:* Roll for Vagaries of War for each army that has left garrison to undertake a campaign.
   2. *Schedule Random Events:* For each random event scheduled to occur this week, choose or roll 1d8 to determine which day it will take place on (re-roll or choose on an 8). Random events include those from prior Random Events steps, as well as any events triggered by prior campaign activities, such as the arrival of mercenaries seeking employment, or merchants interested in transactions.
   3. *First Day’s Activities:* For each domain controlled by a PC or his vassals, make a daily domain encounter throw to see if a vagary of incursion occurs (p. XX). If so, determine the domain encounter. Afterwards, run the day’s activities, which might include dungeon delving (p. XX) or wilderness expeditions (p. XX).
   4. *Second Day’s Activities*: As above.
   5. *Third Day’s Activities*: As above.
   6. *Fourth Day’s Activities:* As above.
   7. *Fifth Day’s Activities:* As above.
   8. *Sixth Day’s Activities:* As above.
   9. *Seventh Day’s Activities:* As above.
2. **Second Week:** As above.
3. **Third Week:** As above.
4. **Fourth Week:** As above. (If your campaign calendar has months with five or more weeks, add more phases.)

### End of Month Stage

This stage occurs at the end of every game month. It consists of five phases: Domain Growth, Congregant Growth, Revenue Collection, Expense Payment, and Domain Morale.

1. **Domain Growth:** During this phase, each PC and named NPC ruler’s domain grows as per *Growing the Domain* in ***ACKS II****,* p. XX. Note that Domain Growth occurs *after* revenue collection. The Domain Growth phase has three sub-phases that occur in the following order:
   1. *Adventuring:* Determine growth triggered by the ruler’s adventures occurring this game month.
   2. *Investment:* Determine growth triggered by agricultural or urban investments made this game month.
   3. *Random Growth:* Determine growth from fortune and misfortune (+1d10! - 1d10!, as modified by domain morale).
2. **Congregant Growth:** During this phase, each divine spellcaster gains 1d10 + CHA bonus congregants per 1,000gp spent proselytizing during this month’s Campaign Activities stage.
3. **Revenue Collection:** During this phase, each PC and named NPC ruler collects revenue from his domain and urban settlement. The Revenue Collection phase has seven sub-phases that occur in the following order:
   1. *Domain Revenue:* Collect land, service, and tax revenue.
   2. *Urban Revenue:* Collect urban revenue.
   3. *Tribute:* Collect tribute from loyal vassals paid last month.
   4. *Special Taxes:* Collect special tax revenue from loyal vassals on whom the “Tax Demanded” duty was imposed or maintained last month.
   5. *Loans:* Collect loans from loyal vassals on whom the “Loan Demanded” duty was imposed or maintained last month.
   6. *Investment Revenue:* Collect revenue from passive investments made or held this month.
   7. *Hijink Revenue:* Collect tribute from syndicate members who did not undertake a specific hijink adjudicated as a campaign activity.
4. **Expense Payment:** During this phase, each PC and named NPC ruler pays expenses for his domain and settlement. The Expense Payment phase has seven ub-phases that occur in the following order:
   1. *Living Expenses:* PC and NPC living expenses are paid, if not previously paid in play.
   2. *Hireling Wages:* Wages of henchmen, mercenaries, specialists, and other hirelings are paid.
   3. *Domain Expenses:* Domain expenses are paid.
   4. *Settlement Expenses:* Settlement expenses are paid.
   5. *Tribute:* Tributes owed to lords are paid. (Note that lords will collect Tribute, as well as Special Taxes and Loans, during the Revenue Collection phase of the next game month.)
   6. *Special Taxes:* Special tax revenue is paid if a “Tax Demanded” duty was imposed or maintained on the PC this month.
   7. *Loans:* Loans are paid if a “Loan Demanded” duty was imposed or maintained on the PC last month.

A ruler may opt to leave one or more expenses unpaid, suffering the appropriate in-game consequences from doing so.

1. **Domain Morale:** During this sub-phase, resolve domain morale rolls and other game mechanics that relate to domain morale. Starting with the domain with the lowest current morale score, make a domain morale roll for each domain with a PC or named NPC ruler, applying any modifiers based on taxes, liturgies, campaign activities, etc. and notes down any effects.

## Campaign Activities

During campaign play, characters have the opportunity to undertake various campaign activities, ranging from adventuring to performing magical research. The rules for campaign activities were introduced in the ***ACKS II******Revised Rulebook***and are presented here so that you don’t have to flip between the books when running the sequence of play.

### Types of Campaign Activities

Activities are divided into **dedicated activities**, **ancillary activities**, and **incidental activities**. Dedicated activities are laborious tasks requiring eight hours to perform. A character who undertakes a dedicated activity is sometimes said to “dedicate the day to that activity.” For instance, “Balbus dedicated the day to magic research” or “the party dedicated the day to travel.”

Ancillary activities are errands or pastimes requiring about one hour (6 turns) to perform. Incidental activities require virtually no time at all. Each game day, an adventurer can undertake one dedicated activity and four ancillary activities or perform up to 12 ancillary activities. A character can perform any number of incidental activities.

Most campaign activities are **singular** **activities** that take place within a single game day, and can be repeated as often as desired within the limits of available activity.A **restricted activity** takes place within a single day, but cannot be repeated until a certain time period elapses. An **ongoing activity** require more than one game day to complete, such that the character will have to perform the activity throughout the given time period. Both dedicated and ancillary activities can be ongoing. A **dedicated ongoing activity** represents a period of full-time labor in order to complete a complex project or task. Magical research, for instance, is a dedicated ongoing activity typically requiring days, weeks, or even months. An **ancillary ongoing activity** represents an intermittent effort occurring in short bursts that must be sustained over a lengthy period of time. Managing a subordinate, for instance, typically requires a short period of time every day for as long as the subordinate is employed.

Most campaign activities are **unstrenuous**, but some are **strenuous.** For every six game days of strenuous activity, a character must dedicate one day to **rest**. Characters who do not get the appropriate rest after six game days of strenuous activity become **fatigued** until they have caught up on required rest. (This is why wilderness travel requires rest and recuperation!) Unstrenuous activities do not require rest.

A character can undertake one, two, three, or even four strenuous ancillary activities without being considered to have engaged in strenuous activity. However, if he undertakes five or more strenuous ancillary activities, he is considered to have engaged in strenuous activity.

Sometimes adventurers might wish to completely dedicate to an activity, that is, to use both their dedicated activity and all of their ancillary activities that day on the task. This is known as **working overtime** (for most activities) or **force marching** (for travel). A character who is working overtime or force marching completely dedicates his day to the activity, and cannot take any ancillary activities; in exchange, he increases time spent and/or distance traveled by 50%.

However, working overtime on an unstrenuous activity makes the activity count as a strenuous activity, so it can only be sustained for six days until rest is required. Force marching or working overtime on a strenuous activity counts as six days of strenuous activity, immediately requiring rest.

In desperate circumstances, characters might want to work all day and through the night. Each additional four ancillary activities (four hours) after working overtime or force marching increases the fatigue penalty by 1 point (rounded up).

Some ongoing activities require a proficiency throw to complete. Characters who work overtime on ongoing activities apply the worst penalty to this throw that they incurred at any point during the process. A minimum penalty of -1 applies if the character worked overtime at all, even if through careful pacing he avoided otherwise incurring penalties.

Most campaign activities are open to any character. Others can only be undertaken if the character meets particular requirements of class, level, location, proficiency, or equipment. The requirements are noted in the activity’s description.

The activities rules are implicitly present in all aspects of play. For instance, delving a dungeon requires an ancillary activity for every 6 turns of exploration. Traveling at expedition speed requires making travel the party’s dedicated activity. Foraging for food is an ancillary activity, so it can be done on the same day dedicated to wilderness travel, but hunting is a dedicated activity so it cannot.

EXAMPLE: After two weeks of overtime (21 days total), Maon has finished a magical research project. Each week he worked five days of overtime, performing magical research twice each day, and then rested for two subsequent days, for a total of (5 x2 x 3) 30 days’ worth of magical research activity. He suffers a -2 penalty to his magic research throw.

### List of Campaign Activities

The lists below summarize the ancillary and dedicated activities that characters in ***ACKS II*** can undertake. Note that not every character can undertake every type of activity. Strenuous activities are listed in *italics*. Strenuous activities always include 1 turn (10 minutes) of rest every 5 turns, e.g. 1 turn of rest per hour.

As an ancillary activity, a character can:

* Assign 12 hijinks to members of a syndicate (p. XX)
* Attune to a dungeon (requires 1 activity per day per 30,000 sf; p. XX)
* Buy equipment in the market (p. XX)
* Collect monthly earnings from a passive investment (p. XX)
* *Delve a dungeon for 6 turns (p. XX*
* *Forage for firewood (p. XX))*
* *Forage for food (limited once per day; p. XX)*
* *Forage for water (limited once per day; p. XX)*
* Inspect a company of troops (p. XX)
* Issue decrees over a domain (p. XX)

* Use Seafaring to sail a vessel or row a vessel at slow speed for 6 turns (p. XX)\*
* Use Trapping to maintain a crude trap (p. XX)
* Warm himself by a campfire to end hypothermia (p. XX)
* Perform any other activity that takes about one hour (Judge’s discretion)

\*Rowing at slow speed or sailing at any speed is not strenuous because the crew works in shifts throughout the day. Rowing at cruise or sprint speed is very tiring and subject to special rules, see **Voyages** in the ***ACKS II RR***p. XX.

As a dedicated activity, a character can:

* Add a spell to his repertoire or change a spell in his repertoire (7 days; p. XX)

## Vagaries

History abounds with dramatic events brought about by unlikeliest of circumstances. The vagaries of fate can bring ruin to the proud, horror to the careful, and glory to the lucky. Here we present a variety of random tables designed to bring the chaos and confusion of history to your ***ACKS***campaigns.

Specific rules for using the vagaries tables are presented separately for each table. As a general rule, whenever a vagary result is implausible or irrelevant, you should re-roll, alter the event to make it plausible, or treat it as a “no vagary” result, as you deem most appropriate to the circumstances.

The use of these tables is strictly optional. The increase in variety and interest comes at a cost in extra bookkeeping and added complexity.

### The Vagaries of Incursion

| 14-16 hexes | 6% | 11% | 44% | 70% |
| **\***Used for dungeons in unsettled territory or under-garrisoned outlands | | | | |

Periodically, domains may suffer incursions from wandering monsters, known as **domain encounters**.Wilderness domains face the most danger from domain encounters, while civilized domains face little risk.

#### Daily Chance

The Daily Domain Encounter Probability by Territory Size and Classificationtable shows the likelihood each day for a domain encounter. Cross-reference the size of the domain’s territory against the classification of the domain’s territory to determine the percentage chance.

EXAMPLE #1: A 24-mile hex is classified outlands territory. If the entire hex were one domain of 16 6-mile hexes, it would have a 44% chance each day of a domain encounter.

EXAMPLE #2: A 24-mile outlands hex is divided between 4 domains, ruled by Andor, Balbus, Cerwyn, and Decimus. Andor’s domain has a territory of 8 hexes; Balbus, 5 hexes; Cerwyn, 2 hexes; and Decimus, 1 hex. Andor’s domain has a 20% chance each day of a domain encounter; Balbus’s domain has a 15% chance; Cerwyn’s domain has a 5% chance; Decimus’s domain has a 3% chance. Note that the expected encounters per day in the entire hex (0.44) is virtually the same as the expected encounters per day in the individual domains: 0.20 (Andor) + 0.15 (Balbus) + 0.05 (Cerwyn) + 0.03 (Decimus), or 0.43.

| 2 hexes | 4d8 x 10 | 2d6 x 10 | 5d6 | 3d6 |
| 3 hexes | 2d8 x 10 | 2d4 x 10 | 3d6 | 2d6 |

| 14-16 hexes | 5d6 | 2d8 | 1d3 | 1d2 |
| \*Used for dungeons in unsettled territory or under-garrisoned outlands | | | | |

#### Periodic Frequency

Rather than make an encounter throw every game day, you can instead assume that encounters regularly occur at a periodic frequency based on the domain territory’s size and classification. To determine the length of time (in days) between encounters, consult the Periodic Domain Encounter Frequencyby Territory Size and Classificationtable and cross-reference the domain’s territory size and classification.

EXAMPLE #1: A 10-hex civilized domain will have a domain encounter every 6d8 days, averaging 27 days between encounters.

EXAMPLE #2: Decimus’s 1-hex outlands domain will have a domain encounter every 6d10 days, averaging 33 days between encounters.

#### Dangerous Borders

Isolated domains face more wandering encounters than those with neighbors. If there’s only one little village around, that’s the village the orcs will raid. A similar problem occurs to border forts and frontier towns. It does less good to be adjacent to large, civilized domains if civilization is *behind* you. Therefore, a domain adjacent to one or more hexes of unsettled territory counts as having a larger territory for purposes of encounter throws.

|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Effective Domain Territory with Dangerous Borders** | | | | |
| **Domain Territory** | **Isolated** | **Spearhead** | **Flank** | **Line** |
| 1 hex | 16 hexes | 8 hexes | 6 hexes | 4 hexes |
| 2 hexes | 16 hexes | 10 hexes | 7 hexes | 4 hexes |
| 3 hexes | 16 hexes | 12 hexes | 9 hexes | 5 hexes |
| 4-6 hexes | 16 hexes | 14 hexes | 10 hexes | 6 hexes |
| 7-8 hexes | 16 hexes | 16 hexes | 12 hexes | 8 hexes |
| 9-10 hexes | 16 hexes | 16 hexes | 14 hexes | 9 hexes |
| 11-13 hexes | 16 hexes | 16 hexes | 16 hexes | 10 hexes |
| 14-16 hexes | 16 hexes | 16 hexes | 16 hexes | 11 hexes |

![](data:image/png;base64...)The accompanying illustration shows four possible territorial configurations of dangerous borders. In each configuration, the territory of the domain is represented with a tower icon; the territory secured by neighboring domains or impassable terrain is light grey; and the unsettled territory is dark grey. The **isolated** domain is surrounded by unsettled territory on all sides. In the **spearhead** configuration, the domain has unsettled territory to its front and flanks, and secure territory to its rear. In the **flank** configuration, the domain has unsettled territory to its front and one flank, and secure territory to its other flank and rear. Finally, in the **line** configuration, the domain has unsettled territory to its front, but its flanks and rear are secured by neighbors or terrain.

You should use this illustration and your own judgment of the regional geography to assess if an adventurer or NPC’s domain has dangerous borders, and if so whether it should be considered to be in an **isolated**, **spearhead**, **flank,** or **line** position. You should then consult the adjoining *Effective Domain Territory with Dangerous Borders* table, cross-referencing the domain’s territory size with its configuration to determine its effective territory size for encounter throws.

These rules make the location of a domain a decision of great long-term importance! A domain with a broad river, impassable cliffs or sturdy neighbors is far easier to defend.

EXAMPLE: Decimus’ outlands domain (1 6-mile hex) has land secure and settled to its rear, while its flanks and front are unsettled wilderness. It is in spearhead configuration. Cross-referencing the “1 hex” row with the “Spearhead” column, the Judge finds that Decimus’s domain has an effective territory of 8 6-mile hexes. Therefore, his domain has a 20% chance per day of a domain encounter or one encounter per 2d4 days.

#### Effect of Strongholds and Garrisons on Domain Encounters

By default, the rules assume that each domain is secured by a stronghold and garrison of sufficient size. If a civilized or borderlands domain has an insufficient garrison and/or stronghold, it is treated as if it were one classification worse for purposes of domain encounters. (E.g. a civilized domain is treated as a borderlands domain, while an outlands domain is treated as an unsettled wilderness).

EXAMPLE: Decimus goes bankrupt due to the machinations of the thieves’ guild, and can no longer pay his garrison. His domain is now treated as if it were unsettled wilderness. His domain has a 30% chance per day of a domain encounter or one encounter per 1d6 days.

#### Effect of Dungeons on Domain Encounters

If a territory includes one or more unoccupied or partly occupied dungeons, any domain encounters that occur might lead to monsters deciding to permanently settle there. If the dungeon is in a civilized, borderlands, or outlands domain, determine the probability or frequency of domain encounters using the rules above. If the dungeon is in unsettled territory, determine the probability or frequency of domain encounters as if it were in a 16-hex unsettled territory.

Attracting monsters into a dungeon is useful for arcane experimentation, but peasants do not enjoy living near monsters. To determine the morale impact of a dungeon on nearby domains, total the experience point value of the monsters in the dungeon and divide that total by the number of families in the domain’s territory (round to the nearest whole number). The quotient represents the penalty to the domain’s base morale.

EXAMPLE: Quintus’ domain has 1,100 peasant families. It also is home to a sinister dungeon with a cyclops (2,400 XP), 6 ogres (1,290 XP), and 60 orcs (600 XP), for 4,290 XP total. 4,290 XP / 1,100 families is 3.9, rounded to 4, so Quintus’ domain suffers a -4 penalty to its domain morale.

If a domain suffers a morale penalty from monsters in its dungeon(s), then any domains neighboring the dungeon’s domain treat the territory as being unsettled land for purposes of dangerous borders. This represents the risk of monsters wandering fromthe dungeon into their lands.

EXAMPLE: Quintus’s domain is on the southwestern flank of a long line of Auran strongholds. To the northeast is the fort of Türos Drav. Normally, Türos Drav would be in a line configuration, but since Quintus’s domain has a morale penalty from monsters, it counts as unsecured wilderness. Türos Drav therefore is treated as in a flank configuration.

#### Resolving Domain Encounters

Not every wandering monster enters a domain with intent to raid and pillage. Some may be exploring, migrating, or trading, while even those with violent intent may retreat if they do not find any weak prey or undefended villages. Conversely, not every violent encounter requires the domain’s ruler to sally forth. A typical domain’s garrison is more than capable of dealing with incursions by wolves, kobolds, or owlbeasts. That’s what garrisons are for!

When a domain encounter throw results in an encounter, the following steps should be followed:

* 1. Roll 1d20 on the Monster Rarity by Territory Classification table and consult the resulting sub-table for the terrain type.
  2. Roll 1d20 on the appropriate Monster Encounter by Terrain Type and Rarity to find the type of creature encountered.
  3. Find the encountered creature’s entry in the ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual***and roll against its **Lair** characteristic to determine whether the creature is **lingering** or **migrating** (explained below).
  4. Roll the appropriate **number encountered** for the creature to determine how many are present.

**Lingering or Migrating:** Wandering monsters are, by definition, not encountered in their lair. However, they may decide to make a lair in the domain.Any wandering monsters that arrive have a percentage chance of lingering in the domain equal to their Lair characteristic. Monsters are twice as likely to linger if treasure is available in an unoccupied or partly-occupied dungeon (see **Populating a Dungeon**in the***ACKS II Revised Rulebook****,* p. XX). Otherwise, the monsters are migrating. Whether the monsters are migrating or lingering changes how the monsters behave (see below).

**Number Encountered:** If the monster is migrating, use the number encountered for a wandering wilderness encounter. If the monster is lingering, roll 1d100 again against its **Lair** characteristic. If the result is again equal to or less than its Lair characteristic, use the number encountered for a wilderness lair. Otherwise, use the number encountered for a wandering wilderness encounter.

**Treasure Type:** Monsters entering a domain do not normally have any treasure of their own. However, if the monsters are a full wilderness lair, or arriving for mercantilist purposes (see below), they will have treasure according to their treasure type.

#### Reconnaissance Rolls for Domain Encounters

When a domain encounter occurs, you should make a reconnaissance rollfor the domain ruler as well as the monsters to determine what intelligence they have about each other. For purposes of reconnaissance, assume the garrison is in the domain’s stronghold if the ruler has not made other arrangements. You should use your judgment to determine the initial location of the wandering monsters based on the geography, roads, strongholds, and settlements in the region. See **Reconnaissance and Intelligence**in the***ACKS II Revised Rulebook****,* p. XX.

It is possible that a domain ruler may not be aware of a domain encounter until the enemy begins pillaging his domain or arrives at his stronghold! Given sufficiently poor reconnaissance, it is even possible for monsters to settle into a domain and impose morale penalties while an oblivious ruler remains unaware of the cause of the problem.

#### Reaction Rolls for Domain Encounters

When a domain encounter occurs, a reaction roll should be made to determine the attitude of the monsters. Roll 2d6, apply any relevant adjustments to the roll, and consult the Domain Encounter Reaction table below. Note that the rulers of the domain do not apply their CHA or proficiency adjustments and do notknow the reaction result until they discover it in play.

**Hostile** means that the monsters have come to wreak havoc. If the domain’s garrison is deployed against them, they will always fight. If the garrison remains in the stronghold, the monsters will assault or besiege the domain’s stronghold if (a) their BR is more than twice that of the garrison and (b) they possess the intelligence and means to do so. If the domain is conquered, the monsters will immediately begin pillaging the domain. If the domain is not conquered, the monsters will immediately begin looting supplies.

If the monsters are lingering, they will remain in the domain until defeated or until they have looted or pillaged it completely. (If a dungeon is available, they will lair therein.) If the monsters are migrating, they will depart after looting or pillaging the domain once. Allowing a domain to be pillaged has disastrous consequences on its population, stronghold value, and domain morale – see **Pillaging Domains**in the***ACKS II Revised Rulebook****,* p. XX. If the monsters settle in the domain, it may affect the domain’s base morale score (see above).

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Domain Encounter Reaction** | |
| **Adjusted Die Roll** | **Sapient** |
| 2- | Hostile, pillage |
| 3-5 | Unfriendly, opportunistic |
| 6-8 | Neutral, exploratory |
| 9-11 | Mercantilist , trade |
| 12+ | Friendly, help |

**Unfriendly** means that the monsters intend violence, but can be deterred. If the domain’s garrison is deployed against them, they will only fight if their BR equals or exceeds that of the garrison; otherwise they will be driven off (either out of the hex or, if lingering, into an available dungeon). If the domain is conquered, the monsters will immediately begin pillaging the domain. If the domain is not conquered, the monsters will immediately begin looting supplies. If the monsters are lingering, they will continue looting and/or pillaging until driven off or defeated, or until they have looted or pillaged it completely. If a dungeon is available, they will then lair therein. If the monsters are migrating, they will depart after looting or pillaging the domain once.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Circumstances** | **Morale Roll Adjustment** |
| Domain’s current morale score | + current morale score |
| Lawful domain encountering lawful monsters | +2 |
| Lawful or neutral domain encountering chaotic monsters | -2\* |
| Chaotic domain encountering lawful monsters | -2\* |
| \*Doubled if monsters’ BR is greater than garrison’s BR. | |

**Neutral** means that the monsters are migrating through the domain for reasons of their own – exploration, scouting, hunting, foraging, etc. If the domain’s garrison is deployed against them, they will become **unfriendly** (as above). If the domain’s garrison is not deployed against them, they will attempt to either find a place to settle (if lingering) or exit peacefully after 1d4 weeks (if migrating). Peasants tend to be xenophobic and distrustful, so if the domain ruler does not deploy the garrison against the monsters, the domain suffers a -1 penalty to its next domain morale roll. If the monsters settle in the domain, it may affect the domain’s base morale score (see above). Re-roll settled neutral monster’s reactions if the domain’s morale score changes.

**Mercantilist** means that the monsters have come with commercial motivations. If the domain’s garrison is deployed against them, they will become **unfriendly** (as above). Otherwise they will travel towards the domain’s urban settlement or stronghold to seek out opportunities for trade. Mercantilist monsters will carry treasure according to their treasure type; you can substitute an equivalent value of merchandise for trade if desired. Mercantilist monsters without treasure might, at your discretion, be offering mercenary services.

**Friendly** means that the monsters actively wish to assist the domain. If the domain’s garrison is deployed against them, they will become **unfriendly** (as above). Otherwise they will travel towards the domain’s urban settlement or stronghold to offer their assistance. If the domain has been invaded by monsters or enemy troops, the friendly monsters may attack the invaders and/or assist the garrison in dealing with them. Friendly monsters can be offered positions as mercenaries or henchmen with a +2 bonus (see below).

**Encounters between Monsters and Adventurers:** The reactions of monsters to individual adventurers that they interact with should be handled with individual reaction rolls as per the ***ACKS II Revised Rulebook****,* p. XX. However, apply a -2 penalty if the monsters are hostile to the domain, a -1 penalty if unfriendly, a +1 bonus if mercantilist, and a +2 bonus if friendly. If the character interacting with the monster is a ruler, senator, or magistrate of the domain, he can attempt to influence the monster’s reaction towards the domain.

**Encounters with Animals:** Encounters with monsters of animal intelligence are limited to results of Neutral or below unless the domain is an elven fastness. Pillaging by animals represents attacks on livestock, carrying off of young, etc.

**Encounters with Mindless Monsters:** Encounters with mindless monsters such as constructs and oozes are limited to results of Neutral or below. Pillaging by mindless monsters represents instinctual or programmed activities.

**Pillaging by Monsters:** The rules for pillaging in the ***ACKS II Revised Rulebook***assume pillaging by large numbers of men. Powerful monsters can pillage with much greater effectiveness. Large monsters (excluding cavalry) count as 2 troops for pillaging purposes; huge monsters count as 6 troops; gigantic monsters count as 24 troops; and colossal monsters count as 120 troops.

#### Military Campaigns for Domain Encounters

The arrival of hostile or unfriendly wandering monsters or the deployment of a garrison normally begins a military campaign. However, most domain encounters do not need to be handled using those detailed mechanics. Typically, the BR of wandering monsters is considerably less than the BR of the garrison, and the monsters will be quickly driven off.

When the threat posed by the monsters is interesting, you can run the domain encounter as a military campaign. In this case, hostile monsters have a strategic stance of *offensive,* while unfriendly monsters have a strategic stance of either *offensive* (if their BR exceeds that of the garrison) or *evasive* (if attempting to retreat).

#### Mass Combat for Domain Encounters

We recommend that you use the mass combat mechanics presented in the ***ACKS II Revised Rulebook***to resolve violent domain encounters. These mechanics allow for the garrison to confront the monsters without the adventurers, while still affording the opportunity for adventurers to influence the outcome through heroic forays.

If you have decided to run the military campaign in detail, the results of that campaign will determine where, how, and when the garrison confronts the wandering monsters. Otherwise, combat between domain garrisons and wandering monsters occurs as follows:

1. Hostile monsters facing a garrison in its stronghold **assault** the stronghold if the monster’s BR is more than twice that of the garrison and they possess the intelligence and means to do so. (Otherwise they simply pillage the domain.)
2. Hostile monsters facing a deployed garrison always fight a **pitched battle** against the garrison.
3. Unfriendly monsters facing a deployed garrison fight a **pitched battle** against the garrison if the monster’s BR is equal to or greater than that of the garrison. (Otherwise they are driven off.)
4. A garrison pursuing monsters into a dungeon **assaults**the dungeon.

Because the number of monsters encountered is usually between a dozen and a hundred, platoon scale should be used for the assaults and battles, with units of 30 man-sized infantry or 15 large creatures or cavalry. Be sure to organize the garrison at platoon scale, too. (Remember that platoon-scale BR is four times higher per individual creature than company-scale BR.)

EXAMPLE: A wilderness domain of 225 families has a garrison expenditure of 900gp per month, with which it retains 60 heavy infantry (720gp per month) and 30 light infantry (180gp per month). At platoon scale, this equals 2 heavy infantry platoons (BR 2.0 each) and 1 heavy infantry platoon (BR 1.0). The garrison’s total BR is 5.0. This is more than enough to deal with most threats. Unfortunately, a bad encounter throw results in the arrival of an entire wilderness lair of orcs. The reaction roll is unfriendly. The Judge decides to use the average encounter: 6 platoons of 30 orcs, each with a BR of 1.0, for a total BR of 6.0. Since the orcs are unfriendly, and their BR is greater than the garrison’s BR, the orcs will fight if the garrison is deployed against them.

The Mass Combat for Domain Encounters tables below present the Battle Rating of various creatures based on their entries in the ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual****.* The number of creatures is pre-organized into platoon-scale units for average-sized wandering and lair wilderness encounters for your convenience.

EXAMPLE: According to the ***ACKS II MM***,a wilderness encounter with bugbears outside of their lair consists of a warband of 1d4 gangs of 2d4 warriors and 1 champion each. That yields an average of [2.5 x (2.5+2.5+1) ] = 15 bugbears. Therefore the Mass Combat for Domain Encounters table entry for bugbears suggests 1 platoon of 15 bugbears in the “Platoons” column.

Meanwhile, a wilderness encounter with bugbears in their lair consists of 1d10 warbands of 1d4 gangs of 2d4 warriors and 1 champion each. That yields an average of 5.5, rounded to 6, warbands. Therefore the Mass Combat for Domain Encounters table entry for bugbears suggests 6 platoons of 15 bugbears in the “Platoons (Lair”) column.

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Beastmen** | **BR** | **Platoons** | **Platoon BR** | **Platoons (Lair)** | **Platoon BR** | **Notes** |
| Beastman, Bugbear | 0.068 | 1 of 15 | 4.00 | 6 of 15 | 4.00 | 25% Lingering/Lair; Leaders |

Some encounter sizes have been adjusted slightly for ease of play and simplicity. Some encounters have been tagged, as follows:

* *Aerial:* The creatures are capable of observing from the air, granting them a +2 bonus to reconnaissance rolls.
* *Aquatic:* The creatures are aquatic. They cannot be attacked by land-based units.
* *Leaders:* The creatures are led by chieftains, sub-chieftains, shamans, and witch doctors. These NPCs can be deployed in heroic forays, but are not otherwise factored into the overall BR of the units. Champions are already factored into the platoons, as are drone bees, soldier ants, etc.
* *Lingering/Lair:* The creatures might linger or lair in the domain.

### The Vagaries of Recruitment

Raising an army can be an uncertain, challenging task. Some rulers find that peasants flock to their banners and mercenaries bid to serve them. Other would-be conquerors are abandoned by conscripts, cheated by mercenaries, betrayed by commanders, and preemptively attacked by rivals. Roll on the Vagaries of Recruitment table each month that a domain ruler is recruiting mercenaries, conscripts, militia, or vassal troops. If modifiers increase the roll to 101+, pick the best vagary for the ruler given his position. If modifiers decrease the roll to 0 or less, pick the worst vagary for the ruler given his position.

**Note:** Certain vagaries will cause the leader to gain or lose units. If the leader rules a duchy or principality, these will be battalion-sized units of 480 infantry or 240 cavalry. If the leader rules a kingdom or empire, these will be brigade-sized units of 1,920 infantry or 960 cavalry. In all other cases, the leader will gain or lose company-sized units of 120 infantry or 60 cavalry.

#### Vagaries of Recruitment Index

**Alliance Offered:** A nearby realm, impressed by the leader’s growing military might, offers an alliance. The ally should be selected from a neighboring domain or realm of approximately the same size as the leader’s own. (If no such domain or realm exists, re-roll this vagary). The ally will support the leader if he goes to war by sending troops worth 1gp per family in the ally’s realm.

**All Quiet:** No vagary befalls the leader this month.

**Bidding War:** A rival leader’s recruitment efforts make it harder to find and hire mercenaries. The cost of finding and hiring mercenaries is increased by 2d4 x 100%. The bidding war lasts for 1d6 months. (Note that mercenary *wages* are not changed.)

EXAMPLE: The cost of finding and hiring mercenaries across a principality is normally 5d6 x 100gp per month. However, a Bidding War vagary occurs. The Judge rolls 2d4 roll and gets a 5. The cost of finding and hiring mercenaries is increased 500% to 5d6 x 500gp per month.

**Bold Captain:** A young commander of surprising talent emerges from the army’s ranks to serve the leader. If the leader’s realm is a duchy or principality, the young commander has the characteristics of a mercenary major; if a kingdom, a colonel; and if an empire, a general. In all other cases, he has the characteristics of a mercenary captain. His base loyalty score is +1 instead of -2.

**Brigands:** Renegade mercenaries begin to harass the realm. The brigands can be treated as an independent enemy army for purposes of military campaigns. The brigand army consists of 1 unit of bowmen and 1 unit of light cavalry and is commanded by a mercenary officer. If the leader’s realm is a barony, viscounty, or county, the commander is a mercenary captain; if a duchy or principality, a mercenary colonel; and if a kingdom or empire, a mercenary general.

There is a 50% chance a crusader will accompany the brigand army and another 50% chance a mage will do so. The crusader and mage will be of level 1d3+2 in a barony, viscounty or county; 1d3+4 in a duchy or principality; and 1d3+6 in a kingdom or empire. Certain other minor NPCs might be present as scouts or chaplains. See the entry for Brigands in the ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual*** (p. XX).

**Commander Casualty:** Make a saving throw versus Death for each commander in the army, starting with the physically oldest commander. The first commander to fail the saving throw has died from falling off a horse, ill health, or other circumstances. The commander can be restored to life through **restore life and limb** or similar magic. (If no failure occurs, this event has no effect).

**Commerce Disrupted:** Rumors of war make the merchant’s guild nervous about doing business in the realm. The leader’s largest urban settlement is treated as one market class smaller for the next 1d6 months.

**Commerce Improves:** The increase in the size of the military makes the merchant’s guild feel secure. The leader’s largest urban settlement is treated as one market class larger for the next 1d6 months.

**Treacherous Mercenaries:** Immediately after receiving its wages, a unit of mercenaries abandons the army. When this vagary occurs, make a morale loyalty roll for each mercenary unit in the army, starting with the unit with the lowest loyalty. The first unit with a result of ‘Betray’ or ‘Immediate Attack’ deserts from the army the day after it is next paid. (If no failure occurs, this event has no effect).

**Foreign Legion:** A unit of mercenaries from a foreign realm offers its services to the army. The type of mercenaries will be of a sort not generally available to the leader. For example, if the leader is a legate of the Auran Empire, the unit might be horse archers from Skysos, barbarians from Jutland, or even wolf riders from the Waste. If hired, language difficulties and cultural mistrust will impose a -1 penalty on the unit’s base loyalty.

**Mercenaries:** A unit of mercenaries offers its services to the army. Determine the type of mercenaries by rolling on the Follower Type and Equipment by Class table (use the army leader’s class). There is a 25% chance the mercenaries are veterans.

**Resignation**: When this vagary occurs, make a loyalty roll for each commander in the army, starting with the commander with the lowest morale. The first commander with a result of ‘Betray’ or ‘Immediate Attack’ unexpectedly resigns. (If no failure occurs, this event has no effect). The reason for the commander’s resignation should be determined by you. It might be ill health, disappointment at assigned duties, disagreement with the leader’s foreign policy, defection to an enemy ruler, or other plausible reasons.

**Soldier of Fortune:** An experienced adventurer offers to serve the leader as a henchman. Generate the soldier of fortune using the NPC Parties rules in ***ACKS***. The soldier of fortune’s base level is two levels lower than that of the leader. The soldier of fortune will expect pay and position in the army appropriate to his class and level.

**Stout Recruits:** Hard times breed hard men. Twice as many conscripts and militia recruited this month qualify for advanced training (as heavy infantry, cavalry, etc.).

**Surplus Sellswords:** Peace has broken out in a neighboring realm, and its mercenaries are available for hire. The crop of mercenaries available in the leader’s realm is doubled for the next four time periods. Mercenary wages do not increase during this time, regardless of how many are hired.

**Tribute:** Tribute pours in from vassals and clients, increasing the leader’s war-chest. The leader receives gold pieces equal to the lesser of one month’s wages for his army or one gp per family in his overall realm. This increases his domain income for purposes of campaign XP.

**War Declared:** A rival ruler, threatened by the leader’s mustering of arms, declares war. The rival should be selected from a neighboring domain or realm of approximately the same size as the leader’s own. (If no such domain or realm exists, re-roll this vagary.) The rival will have a full complement of vassal troops, which he will use to attack as swiftly as possible.

**War Profiteers:** Merchants take advantage of the mobilization to raise prices. The cost of adventuring equipment, artillery ammunition, armor, mounts, weapons is increased by 10% for 1d4 seasons. Each time this vagary is rolled, prices increase an additional 10%.

**Weak Recruits:** Any conscripts and militia recruited this month are a weak and sickly lot. While normally 50% of conscripts and militia would qualify to be heavy infantry or archers, these pathetic excuses for soldiery cannot qualify as anything except light infantry.

### The Vagaries of War

An army on campaign in enemy territory, out of garrison for more than one month, may be subject to a variety of random events. It may acquire camp followers, be approached by mercenaries, or lose units to disease or desertion. Roll 1d100 on the Vagaries of War table each week after checking for supply.

An army besieging a stronghold, or under siege within a stronghold, suffers even more stress. Roll 1d100 twice per week and use whichever result is lower (worse). Use of the Vagaries of War table during sieges is highly recommended because a siege is just not a siege without the chance for an epidemic…

**Notes:** Certain vagaries will cause the leader to gain or lose units. If the leader rules a duchy or principality, these will be battalion-sized units of 480 infantry or 240 cavalry. If the leader rules a kingdom or empire, these will be brigade-sized units of 1,920 infantry or 960 cavalry. In all other cases, the leader will gain or lose company-sized units of 120 infantry or 60 cavalry.

#### Vagaries of War Index

**All Quiet:** No vagary befalls this army this week.

**Artillery Cache:** The army has stumbled upon a cache of artillery set aside by some foresighted commander in prior campaigns. The army finds 1d4 different artillery units. Each has 1d6 days’ worth of ammunition.

**Brigands:** Brigands raid the army’s supply lines. Until the brigands are dealt with, the army’s supply costs are increased by 10% (representing provisions lost to banditry) and its reconnaissance rolls are at -1 (because of the need to divert light troops from scouting to guarding the supply lines). The brigands can be treated as an independent enemy army for purposes of military campaigns. The brigand army consists of 1 unit of bowmen and 1 unit of light cavalry and is commanded by a mercenary officer. If the leader’s realm is a barony, viscounty, or county, the commander is a mercenary captain; if a duchy or principality, a mercenary colonel; and if a kingdom or empire, a mercenary general.

There is a 50% chance a crusader will accompany the brigand army and another 50% chance a mage will do so. The crusader and mage will be of level 1d3+2 in a barony, viscounty or county; 1d3+4 in a duchy or principality; and 1d3+6 in a kingdom or empire. Certain other minor NPCs might be present as scouts or chaplains. See the entry for Brigands in the ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual*** (p. XX).

**Brigands:** The brigands can be treated as an independent enemy army. The brigand “army” consists of 1 company of bowmen and 1 company of medium cavalry, each led by a 3rd level fighter with command characteristics of a mercenary lieutenant. The overall army leader will be a 6th level fighter with command characteristics of a mercenary captain. The captain will employ 2 4th level explorers or thieves as scouts. There is a 50% chance that the brigands will be accompanied by 1d3 3rd level crusaders led by a crusader of level 1d3+2. There is a 50% chance that the brigands will be accompanied by 1d2 theurgists (2nd level mages) led by a mage of level 1d3+2. See the entry for Brigands in the ***ACKS II******Monstrous Manual***for more details.

**Camp Followers:** The army has attracted a following of itinerants, tinkers, harlots, peddlers, and camp-wives. The presence of the civilians creates chaos and ill-discipline. While the camp followers are with the army, its expedition speed is reduced by 1/3, and enemy spies gain a +2 bonus to conduct hijinks against the army. Nevertheless, the soldiers enjoy having the camp followers around! If the army leader drives off the camp followers, this counts as a calamity for morale purposes.

**Commander Casualty:** Make a Death saving throw for each commander in the army, starting with the physically oldest commander. The first commander to fail the saving throw has died from falling off a horse, ill health, or other circumstances. The commander can be restored to life through **restore life and limb** or similar magic. (If no failure occurs, this event has no effect).

**Defection:** When this vagary occurs, make a morale roll for each commander in the relevant army, starting with the commander with the lowest morale. The first commander with a result of ‘Betray’ or ‘Immediate Attack’ becomes a defector. (If no failure occurs, this event has no effect.) If there is an opposing army within one week’s march, the defector will immediately defect from his current army and bring the units under his command over to the opposing army. Otherwise, the defector will wait until an opportune moment presents itself, feigning loyalty until then.

**Desertion:** When this vagary occurs, make a morale roll for each unit in the army, starting with the unit with the lowest morale. The first unit with a result of ‘Betray’ or ‘Immediate Attack’ deserts from the army. (If no failure occurs, this event has no effect.) If there is an enemy force within one week’s march, the deserters will join the opposing army. Otherwise, the deserters will simply disband and make for home.

**Disease:** Disease is endemic to any military campaign, and at any time 1%-2% of the troops are probably ill with colds, diarrhea, or fevers. This vagary represents something much worse: A major epidemic breaking out amidst the army.

When this vagary occurs, the type of disease is determined with a roll of 1d100 on the Disease Type table. Each unit must then make a Death saving throw against the disease. Certain diseases, being less acute, offer a saving throw bonus.

|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Disease Type** | | | | |
| **Die Roll** | **Disease Type** | **Save Bonus** | **Duration** | **Death** |
| 1-5 | Plague | 0 | 1d8 days | Failed by 6+ |
| 6-15 | Putrid Fever | 0 | 2 weeks | Failed by 7+ |
| 16-30 | Spotted Pox | +1 | 3 weeks | Failed by 8+ |
| 31-50 | Bilious Fever | +2 | 4 weeks | Failed by 8+ |
| 51-75 | Ague | +3 | 1d4 weeks | Failed by 10+ |
| 76-100 | Bloody Flux | +4 | 1 week | Rolled Natural 1 |

If the saving throw succeeds, the troops in the unit avoid any serious illness. If the saving throw fails, the troops in the unit become **incapacitated** for the listed duration. Diseased troops cannot move or fight.

At the end of the duration, diseased troops either recover or die. If the saving throw failed on a roll of natural 1, or by the amount noted on the Disease Type table, the diseased troops expire from the illness, and the unit is removed from play. Otherwise, the diseased troops recover. Saving throws should be made secretly by you, so the army commanders are unaware of whether their units will recover.

Note that while onset time can be an important factor for adventurers facing disease (see p. XX), it is not a factor when a disease vagary occurs – the disease has already spread through the army.

,

EXAMPLE: An army of 4 0th-level mercenary units is on campaign when a “disease” event is rolled. The Judge rolls 1d100 on the Disease Type table and gets a 30, so the disease is spotted pox. Each unit must make a saving throw versus Death at +1. 0th level mercenaries have a saving throw versus Death of 15+, so with the +1 bonus the units will need to roll a 14 or better. The first unit rolls a 14 and avoids the illness. The second unit rolls a 10. It is diseased for three weeks, but then recovers. The third unit rolls a natural 1. It is diseased for three weeks, then eliminated (since it rolled a natural 1 on the save). The fourth unit rolls a 4. It is diseased for three weeks, then eliminated (since it failed the save by 8 or more).

Diseased units can be cured through treatment by divine spellcasters and/or healers. It requires one 9th level divine spellcaster, two 7th-8th level divine spellcasters, three 6th level divine spellcasters or chirugeons, or nine physickers to cure one sickened unit in one week. If there are a greater or lesser number of casters or healers, the rate at which disease can be cured is increased or decreased proportionately.

EXAMPLE: The army has one 7th level crusader and one chirugeon with it. After two weeks of casting **cure disease** each day, the crusader can cure a unit. After three weeks of treating troops with medicine, and a successful proficiency throw, the chirugeon can cure a second unit. There is not enough time before the course of the illness ends for either the crusader or the chirugeon to treat additional units.

**Friendly Lord:** A local lord makes generous gestures towards the army. He will offer to become a vassal or sub-vassal of the army leader, and extend the use of his stronghold as a supply base. He will also pay a tribute of gold equal to his monthly income. In exchange, the lord will expect his domain to be protected from looting, conquest, and pillage by the army.

**Friendly Peasants:** The local populace keeps the army appraised of enemy movements. The army gains a +2 to all reconnaissance rolls for the next week. This benefit is lost if the army requisitions or loots supplies from any domains during the week.

**Good Omen:** A positive portent, such as a comet, a flight of eagles, or a vision of a deity in the clouds, improves the army’s morale. Morale rolls gain a +1 bonus for the next week. Add 10 to the army’s next roll on the Vagaries of War table.

**Good Weather:** Good weather shines on the army. While this vagary occurs, you should roll twice each day for temperature, precipitation, and wind and apply whichever result is better. (If you have rolled the weather in advance, roll once each day and substitute the new result if better.)

**Ill Omen:** An ominous portent, such as an encounter with diseased animals, a flight of crows, or a dark face in a storm, worries the troops. Morale rolls suffer a -1 penalty for the next week. Subtract 10 from the army’s next roll on the Vagaries of War table.

**Legendary Leadership:** A legend begins to grow around the army’s leader. He acquires a sobriquet or victory title, such as “Lion-Hearted” or “Hammer of the Scots.” His morale modifier is increased by 1. The benefit is lost if the leader’s army is ever defeated in two consecutive battles.

**Local Guides:** Helpful natives offer to guide the army through their land. If the offer is accepted, the local guides increase the army’s speed by 33% through their knowledge of hidden passes and forgotten roads. The local guides remain with the army for one week. The bonus from local guides does not apply if the army is already following a road.

**Mercenaries:** A unit of mercenaries offers its services to the army. Determine the type of mercenaries by rolling on the Follower Type and Equipment by Class table (use the leader’s class). There is a 25% chance the mercenaries are veterans.

**Ministers:** 2d6 crusaders of level 1d4 announce join the campaign and begin ministering to the troops. The presence of these holy men increases the morale of all units in the army by +1. The ministers depart the army if camp followers (see above) are permitted on the campaign or if the army leader acts contrary to their faith.

**Plans Discovered:** Through an intercepted courier, mole, or other means, one army has gotten access to the battle plans of the other. The army benefiting from this vagary learns the location, organization, and leadership of the opposing army as if it had scored a major success on a reconnaissance roll. It also automatically wins the next initiative roll against the opposing army.

**Severe Weather:** This vagary represents a bout of very severe weather, lasting for 1d4 weeks. (If this vagary is rolled again while a severe weather vagary is ongoing, add the durations together.) While this vagary occurs, you should roll twice each day for temperature, precipitation, and wind and apply whichever result is worse. (If you have rolled the weather in advance, roll once each day and substitute the new result if worse.) It should be noted that this vagary is *far* more punishing on certain seasonal and terrain combinations than others. Winter campaigns in mountain terrain or summer campaigns in jungle terrain, for example, can be disastrous. It should be noted that this vagary is *far* more punishing on certain seasonal and terrain combinations than others. Winter campaigns in mountain terrain or summer campaigns in jungle terrain, for example, can be disastrous.

**Siege Train Problems:** The hazards of campaigning are hard on siege artillery. Making a saving throw versus Death for each artillery piece in the army. If the artillery has a siege engineer or artillerist assigned to it, it saves as a 4th level fighter; otherwise, it saves a normal man. A failed saving throw means the artillery piece has broken (0 shp). Broken artillery can be repaired as a construction project (remember that repair rate for wood is 5 shp per gp of construction rate).

**Spy Found:** The army has caught a spy infiltrated into the army by an opposing army. If the opposing army or armies have two or more spies infiltrated into the army, choose one randomly. If the opposing army or armies haven’t infiltrated any spies into the army, then the army has caught a soldier that had just become a turncoat. In any case,the spy can be interrogated. He will know 1d4 common pieces of information about the opposing army.

**Spy Lost:** The army has lost a spy it sent to infiltrate an opposing army. If the army has sent two or more spies to infiltrate an opposing army, choose one randomly. If the army hasn’t sent any spies to infiltrate any opposing armies, then the opposing army has caught a soldier that had just become a turncoat. In any case, the spy can be interrogated. He will know 1d4 common pieces of information about the army.

**Supply Boon:** The army is well-provisioned by local sources. The army might get donations of bread from friendly peasants, stumble upon a herd of migrating animals, or be able to fish in nearby lakes and rivers. The army is automatically in supply this week, without the army leader being responsible for paying supply cost. The army’s market class is raised by 1 for purposes of equipment availability this month.

**Supply Problems:** The army’s supplies do not arrive this week. Whether this is due to bad weather, bandits, corruption, sabotage, or other causes, the result is the same: The army is out of supply. Supply problems can cause even the most lawful, well-provisioned force to turn to requisitioning and looting, for otherwise the army will suffer the unfortunate consequences of lack of supply (-1 hp per day, -1 to attack throws and damage rolls per day, and a morale calamity).

**Treacherous Guides:** Helpful-seeming natives offer to guide the army through their land. If the offer is accepted, the guides begin spying on the army for the enemy. Increase the army’s movement rate by 33%, but give the enemy one free hijink and a +1 bonus on reconnaissance rolls. The local guides remain with the army for one week.

**War Profiteers:** Merchants are making enormous profits from the campaign. The cost of artillery ammunition, armor, mounts, supplies, and weapons is increased by 10% for the duration of the campaign. Each time this vagary is rolled, prices increase an additional 10%.

### The Vagaries of Battle

Battles are never straightforward, particularly when heroes, wizards, and monsters are involved. Each time the adventurers make a heroic foray as described in the ***ACKS II Revised Rulebook***, roll 1d4 to determine the number of vagaries that will occur. For each vagary, roll 1d100 on the Vagaries of Battle table to see what the adventurers are confronted with.

**Note:** Whenever “battlefield” is mentioned below, it refers to the particular area of the battlefield where the foray is being fought, not necessarily the battlefield as a whole. Whenever “adventurer” is mentioned, it refers to the player characters making the foray as well as any followers, henchmen, or hirelings that accompanied them on the foray.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Die Roll** | **Vagary of Battle** |
| 01-03 | Ambush: A trap is sprung and the battle is suddenly more dangerous. |
| 04-07 | Battle Standard: The vanguards of the armies are so close that each side’s battle standard is within sight. |
| 08-12 | Blood and Mud: The battlefield here is soaked in blood and mud. |
| 13-17 | Bombardment: A nearby unit of artillery begins lobbing fire onto the battlefield. |
| 18-23 | Booby Traps: Battlefield traps confound, kill, and maim the unwary. |
| 24-28 | Calm Amidst the Storm: No vagary occurs. |
| 29-30 | Culmination: The battle nears a culminating point as troops from both sides join the foray. |
| 31-35 | Debris: The area is littered with tree limbs, crumbling walls, spent ammunition, and similar debris. |
| 36-40 | Debris, Dangerous: The fighting is taking place on dangerously littered terrain. |
| 41-45 | Debris, Heavy: The battlefield is punctuated with breached stone walls, fallen trees, and ancient ruins. |
| 45-50 | Deserters: Deserters seeking to flee the battlefield interrupt the fight. |
| 51-55 | Fire: Burning pitch, flaming arrows, fire-breathing monsters, or magical spells have ignited the battlefield. |
| 56-60 | Fog and Smoke: A thick cloud obscures the battlefield. (Maximum visibility distance reduced to 20’.) |
| 61-65 | High Ground: The defending army has seized the high ground. |
| 66-70 | Marauders: Bandits and cut-throats are attempting to use the chaos of battle for their sinister ends. |
| 71-75 | Monsters: Monsters have been drawn to the battlefield by the blood and slaughter. |
| 75-80 | Piles of Dead: Huge piles of dead troops lay in heaps on the ground. |
| 81-85 | Reinforcements, Enemy: Enemy troops join the foray. |
| 86-90 | Reinforcements, Friendly: Friendly troops join the foray. |
| 91-95 | Scattered Bodies: Bodies of the fallen are scattered across the battlefield. |
| 96-100 | Volley of Arrows: Arrows fill the skies, striking friend and foe. |

#### Vagaries of Battle Index

**Ambush:** A trap is sprung and the battle is suddenly more dangerous. All of the adventurers must roll for surprise with a -2 penalty. The distance between the adventurers and each group of foes is halved.

**Battle Standards:** The vanguards of the armies are so close that each side’s battle standard is within sight. Double the BR staked for this foray. (For example, if the adventurers staked 2 points of BR when they entered the foray, resolve the foray as if they had staked 4 BR.) All creatures on either side gain +2 to morale rolls because of the presence of their battle standards.

**Blood and Mud:** The battlefield here is soaked in blood and mud. Due to the wet, slippery conditions, creatures that roll a natural 1 on attack or saving throws fall prone.

**Bombardment:** A nearby unit of artillery begins lobbing fire onto the battlefield. 1d4 rounds after the foray begins, make an attack throw with a target value of 18+ (ignoring armor) against each creature in the foray. A hit means the creature has been caught in the blast radius of a catapult stone, and suffers 4d6 extraordinary bludgeoning damage unless it makes a successful Blast save.

**Booby Traps:** Battlefield traps confound, kill, and maim the unwary. There is one trap on the battlefield for each point of BR staked. The typical battlefield trap is a concealed pit filled with sharpened stakes. An adventure moving at combat speed has a 1 in 6 chance of moving into a previously-undiscovered battlefield trap each round, while an adventuring moving at charging/running speed has a 2 in 6 chance. If an adventurer moves into the trap, he falls 10’ (1d6 bludgeoning damage) onto 1d4 spikes (each dealing 1d6 piercing damage).

**Calm Amidst the Storm:** No vagary occurs.

**Culmination:** The battle nears a culminating point as troops from both sides join the foray. In each of the first 5 rounds of the foray, an additional 10 HD of creatures will join per point of Battle Rating staked.

**Debris:** The area where the fighting occurs is littered with tree limbs, crumbling walls, spent ammunition, and similar debris. Creatures that run or charge must make successful Paralysis saving throws or fall prone half-way through their move.

**Debris, Dangerous:** The fighting is taking place on terrain dangerously littered with discarded weapons, splinters of shattered wood, and fragments of bone. Creatures that run or charge must make a Paralysis save or fall prone and suffer 1d4 bludgeoning damage.

**Debris, Heavy:** The battlefield is punctuated with breached stone walls, fallen trees, ancient ruins, and other obstacles. Speeds are halved, and no charging or running is permitted. Thieves and others skilled in hiding will find ample cover available to make use of their abilities (+2 bonus to proficiency throws).

**Deserters:** Deserters seeking to flee the battlefield interrupt the fight. The deserters will arrive 1d4 rounds after the foray begins. They will belong to whichever side has fewer HD present in the foray. There will be 10 HD of deserters present per point of BR staked. The deserters will enter the battlefield from the enemy’s side and seek to escape to the friendly side. The deserters will attack any creatures that block their escape. PCs and NPCs from their side may attempt to rally them to return to the fight by making reaction rolls.

**Fire:** The battlefield is on fire! Burning pitch, flaming arrows, fire-breathing monsters, or magical spells have ignited blood, flesh, trees, and oil. Each round, all participants must make successful Blast saving throws or suffer 1d4 fire damage. Maximum visibility distance is reduced to 20’ due to smoke.

**Fog and Smoke:** A thick cloud obscures the battlefield, because of dust kicked up by marching men, magical clouds, burning smoke, and so on. Maximum visibility distance is reduced to 20’ for the duration of the foray.

**High Ground:** The defending army has seized the high ground. All of its forces in this foray gain a +1 bonus to attack throws because the forces of the attacking army are **subjacent**.

**Marauders:** Bandits and cut-throats are attempting to use the chaos of battle for their sinister ends. 1d4 rounds after the foray begins, 10 HD of brigands arrive per point of Battle Rating staked. The brigands will attack weak and damaged creatures and make off with their carried equipment. Brigands are often deserters of one side or the other who have fled from fighting elsewhere but can also be independent forces.

**Monsters:** Monsters have been drawn to the battlefield by the blood and slaughter. 1d4 rounds after the foray begins, 10 HD of monsters arrive per point of Battle Rating staked. You can pick the monster type or determine it randomly based on the battlefield’s terrain. The monsters will attack weak and damaged creatures.

**Piles of Dead:** Huge piles of dead troops lay in heaps on the ground. Speeds are halved because of the carrion obstacles, and no charging or running is permitted. The corpses can be **animated** by necromancers. Thieves and others skilled in hiding will find ample cover available to make use of their abilities (+2 bonus to proficiency throws). All creatures suffer a -2 penalty to morale rolls due to the awful carnage.

**Scattered Bodies:** 1d10 x 10 bodies of the fallen are scattered across the battlefield. The corpses can be **animated** by necromancers. Because of the cadaverous litter, creatures that run or charge must make successful Paralysis saving throws or fall prone half-way through their move. All creatures suffer a -1 penalty to morale rolls due to sight of the casualties.

**Reinforcements:** Additional troops join the foray from one of the sides 1d4 rounds after it begins. 10 HD of creatures will join per point of Battle Rating staked.

**Volley of Arrows:** Arrows fill the skies, striking friend and foe. 1d4 rounds after the foray begins, make an attack throw with a target value of 11+ (modified by AC) against each creature in the foray. A hit deals 1d6 piercing damage to the creature struck.

## Additional Rules for Campaigns

The following rules cover a variety of circumstances that can arise during an ***ACKS II***campaign.

### Hiring Henchmen

At some point during any ***ACKS II***campaign, the players are certain to inquire as to whether it is possible to find and hire specific types of henchmen (e.g. one with a particular class or proficiency) instead of just seeing what the market has to offer. When this occurs, you can use the following rules to determine whether or not the adventurers can find a suitable candidate. When seeking a specific henchma, all rules for hiring henchmen still apply, except as described here.

#### Rarity of Henchmen

The likelihood of finding henchmen still varies with market class, but is now modified by the rarity of candidates who meet the desired qualifications.

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Henchman Availability by Market Class and Rarity** | | | | | | |
| **Rarity** | **Class I** | **Class II** | **Class III** | **Class IV** | **Class V** | **Class VI** |
| **Ubiquitous** | 2d8 | 1d4 | 1d1 | 1 (50%) | 1 (20%) | 1 (7%) |
| **Common** | 2d4 | 1d3 | 1 (50%) | 1 (25%) | 1 (10%) | 1 (4%) |
| **Uncommon** | 1d3 | 1 (60%) | 1 (25%) | 1 (12%) | 1 (5%) | 1 (2%) |
| **Rare** | 1d2 | 1 (35%) | 1 (15%) | 1 (7%) | 1 (3%) | 1 (1%) |
| **Very Rare** | 1 (50%) | 1 (15%) | 1 (7%) | 1 (3%) | 1 (1%) | - |
| **Extremely Rare** | 1 (20%) | 1 (6%) | 1 (2%) | 1 (1%) | - | - |
| **Legendary** | 1 (10%) | 1 (3%) | 1 (1%) | - | - | - |

EXAMPLE: Phaedra is in Aura, a Class I city. She is looking for a henchman of Very Rare qualifications. She has a 50% chance each month of finding such a henchman.

The adventurers can hire from this table once per month for each desired specification of henchmen. However, they are still limited by the total number of henchmen available in the market. You must determine and track that number, and limit the results appropriately.

EXAMPLE: Phaedra is in Aura, a Class I city. She is looking for henchmen of Ubiquitous qualifications, of which there are 2d8 available. The Judge rolls a 16! However, according to the Hireling Availability by Market Class table (in ***ACKS II RR***), there are only 5d10 1st level henchmen of all types available in a Class I market. The Judge rolls low – a 14. Therefore, the party cannot hire 16 Common henchmen, as there’s only 14 total henchmen available. (This doesn’t come up very often.)

###### Henchmen Rarity by Class

Sometimes an adventurer will seek to hire henchmen of a particular class. Each class is assigned a rarity, ranging from Ubiquitous to Legendary, that indicates how easy it is to find a prospective henchman of that profession who is looking for work. Obviously, the rarer the class, the harder to find a member of it! Once the rarity of the desired class is known, consult the Henchman Availability by Market Class and Rarity table to find out if a member of the desired class is looking for work in this market.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Class Rarity** | |
| **Rarity** | **Classes** |
| **Ubiquitous** | Explorer, Fighter |
| **Common** | Crusader, Mage, Thief, Venturer |
| **Uncommon** | Assassin, Bard, Bladedancer, Priestess |
| **Rare** | Barbarian, Shaman, Warlock |
| **Very Rare** | Dwarven Craftpriest, Dwarven Vaultguard, Paladin, Witch |
| **Extremely Rare** | Elven Nightblade, Elven Spellsword, Zaharan Ruinguard |
| **Legendary** | Nobiran Wonderworker |

The rarities listed here are suggestions based on an average (human) settlement, and might vary based on location. You should feel free to adjust the rarity of any particular class as desired to better fit the specific location or your campaign in general. For instance, normally a dwarven vaultguard is Very Rare. In a city that borders an active dwarven vault, the class might only be Rare. In the vault itself, they might be Common. Such adjustments are left up to you based on the needs of your own campaign. As an example, below we created a Class Rarity table representing a barbarian clanhold in the Kingdoms of Jutland.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Class Rarity – Kingdom of Jutland** | |
| **Rarity** | **Classes** |
| **Ubiquitous** | Barbarian |
| **Common** | Bard, Explorer, Fighter, Thief, Venturer |
| **Uncommon** | Assassin, Bard, Shaman, Witch |
| **Rare** | Bladedancer, Mage, Priestess, Warlock |
| **Very Rare** | Dwarven Craftpriest, Dwarven Vaultguard |
| **Extremely Rare** | Crusader, Paladin |
| **Legendary** | Nobiran Wonderworker, Zaharan Ruinguard |

If a henchman is successfully hired, it is important to know the henchman’s level. Roll on the Random Henchman Level table to determine what level the new henchman of the desired class is. If hiring in a Class VI market, apply a -2 penalty to the roll.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Random Henchman Level** | |
| **Roll (1d20)** | Level |
| **10 or lower** | 1 |
| **11-16** | 2 |
| **17-18** | 3 |
| **19-20** | 4 |

###### Henchmen Rarity by Class and Level

An adventure might also seek out henchmen of a specific class and level (for example, “a 4th level fighter”). When seeking specifically level 1 henchman, there is no modifier to rarity. For each level above 1st, shift the rarity by one row down. If this would shift the rarity past Legendary, it is not possible to find by this method, and the hiring character will need to accept what he gets.

EXAMPLE: Fighter is a Common class. Looking for a 4th level fighter would increase the rarity by 3, from Common to Very Rare.

###### Henchmen Rarity by General Proficiency

Sometimes an adventurer will seek out henchmen who have a specific general proficiency such as Alchemy or Navigation. If so, you will again consult the Henchman Availability by Market Class and Rarity table. Henchmen (of a random class) with a single rank in a specific general proficiency are Ubiquitous; henchmen with two ranks are Common; and henchmen with three ranks are Uncommon. Roll 1d4 for each such henchman; on a 1-3, the henchman is 0th level. On a 4, roll on the Random Henchman Level table. If hiring in a Class VI market, apply a -2 penalty to the roll. If the henchman is 1st level or above, you should generate the new henchman’s class as normal for a henchman found in this location.

**Designer’s Note:** The number of henchmen with any given set of general proficiencies in a market is about 20% of the number of specialists with the same set of general proficiencies in the same market. Why the difference? Because most specialists already have a good, stable job that pays their bills and they aren’t willing to hare off into the wilderness, follow you into dungeons, and probably die. The number available as henchmen is only a subset of all those who actually possess the desired skill!

###### Henchmen Rarity by Class Proficiency

Adventurers might seek out henchmen who have a specific class proficiency such as Loremastery or Magical Engineering. If so, you will again consult the Henchman Availability by Market Class and Rarity table. Begin with the rarity of the specific class that has the proficiency. If multiple classes have access to the proficiency and the prospective employer does not care which one, use the lowest rarity. The rarity of the combination is equal to the base class, plus one for each rank in the proficiency or proficiencies.

If this would increase the rarity past Legendary, it is not possible to find by this method; the prospective employer will need to accept what he gets, which may or may not be what he desired.

#### Commissioning the Hire of a Henchman

If a character lets it be known that he is searching for a specific henchman and is willing to wait to hire them, word will spread. The character must pay the Searching for Henchmen fee by Market Class for a full month in order to commission the hire of a henchman. Once the fee is paid and the word sent out, the character can roll on the table as if the desired class was one rarity lower.

EXAMPLE: Phaedra wishes to hire a Nobiran Wonderworker as a henchman. Nobiran Wonderworker has a rarity of Legendary, meaning that even in a Class I market, there is only a 10% chance of finding one. Phaedra wants better odds than this, so she spends a month paying the fees and letting it be known that she wishes to hire a Wonderworker. At the end of the month, the Judge checks for availability as if the Wonderworker were only Extremely Rare - a 20% chance! Unfortunately, the Judge rolls an 83 and she fails to find the Wonderworker. However, she can continue searching, paying the fee and rolling again each month.

#### Guidelines for Evaluating a Class’s Rarity

Many campaigns will include classes not listed here, and you might wish to know how the rarity of the existing classes was evaluated in order to remain consistent. The following set of guidelines can be used to establish a baseline. They are guidelines only, and not every class listed above is exactly as rare as these guidelines would suggest.

All classes begin as Ubiquitous. Their rarity is then adjusted upwards based on their abilities:

* Class is demihuman outside of own realm +3 rarity
* Class is found only or primarily in clanholds or other barbaric regions +2 rarity
* Class is able to cast magic (arcane, divine, eldritch, etc.) +1 rarity per magic type
* Class has exceptional abilities found on no other class +1 rarity
* Class is a specialized subset of a core class +1 rarity
* Class has exceptional attribute requirements +1 rarity or more

A class cannot be rarer than Legendary. If a class would be above Legendary, it is the Judge’s discretion whether to round up or down; that is, whether to set it to Legendary or to say that it is unavailable for hire.

EXAMPLE #1: The venturer is a core class but it has exceptional abilities that no other class has (+1), so it is Common.

EXAMPLE #2: The barbarian is a specialized subset of the core fighter class (+1) and found only in barbaric regions (+2), so it is Rare.

EXAMPLE #3: The ruinguard is a demihuman (+3) arcane (+1) caster with exceptional abilities found on no other class (+1), so it is Extremely Rare.

EXAMPLE #4: The wonderworker is a demihuman (+3) arcane (+1) and divine (+1) caster with exceptional attribute requirements (+1) so it is Legendary.

### Unconventional Strongholds

The Campaigns chapter in the ***ACKS II******Revised Rulebook***assumes that the adventurers undertake domain activities in accordance with their class. Thieves build hideouts and run criminal syndicates, mages build sanctums and extract power from dungeons, and so on. But sometimes a character might end up in a control of a stronghold that is atypical to his class. This might occur because the character builds an atypical stronghold or because he acquires it fortuitously through conquest or reward.

A character who acquires or builds an unconventional stronghold usually does not attract followers from the stronghold. (He can still attract followers from building a separate class-appropriate stronghold, however.) The character also usually does not gain any of the special benefits of the stronghold. However, if a character has acted so atypically for his class that he is perceived within the wider world as if he were a member of another class, and should be treated as such, then you can (at your discretion) ignore this rule and allow the character to benefit from the atypical stronghold.

#### Cloister

Any character can build or claim a cloister. The character does not attract followers from doing so, and does not get a discount on construction costs. The cloister can be used to secure a domain if territory is cleared.

#### Dungeon

Any character can build a dungeon or claim a cleared dungeon. Over time, the dungeon will become occupied by monsters according to the procedures outlined in ***ACKS II******Revised Rulebook***. If the character is a powerful arcane spellcaster (caster level 9 or higher), he can operate the dungeon as described, including establishing sovereignty, harvest monster parts, extract power, etc. If not, the monsters will not acknowledge his mastery of the territory and instead will use the dungeon as a base from which to assail him.

#### Fastness

Any character can build or claim a fastness. The character does not attract followers from doing so unless he is a barbarian or explorer, or of an Elven Bloodline. The character never gains the friendship of local animals. The fastness can be used to secure a domain if territory is cleared. However, if the domain secured is inhabited by elves and the character is not an elf and does not have an Elven Bloodline), the domain’s morale score is reduced by 2.

#### Fortified Temple

Any character can build or claim a fortified temple. The character does not attract followers from doing so unless he is a fighter with Theology proficiency or a paladin. The character does not get a discount on construction costs. The temple can be used to secure a domain if territory is cleared.

#### Guildhouse

Any character can build or claim a guildhouse, but he does not attract followers and does not gain a benefit to passive investment. If he has Streetwise proficiency, he can use the guildhouse to establish a syndicate, but must recruit ruffians to staff it.

#### Hideout

Any character can build or claim a hideout. However, he does not attract followers from doing so. If he has Streetwise proficiency, he can use the hideout to establish a syndicate, but must recruit ruffians to staff it.

#### Vault

Any character can build or claim a vault. However, he does not attract followers from doing so unless he is a barbarian. The vault can be used to secure a domain if territory is cleared. However, if the domain secured is inhabited by dwarves and the character is not a dwarf, the domain’s morale score is reduced by 2. Other dwarven vaults will automatically be hostile to a vault ruled by a non-dwarf.

#### Other Strongholds

Any character can build or claim any other type of stronghold (e.g. border fort, castle, chieftain’s hall, dark fortress, medicine lodge, sanctum). The character does not attract followers from doing so. The stronghold can be used to secure a domain if territory is cleared.

### Wishes and Warfare

When archmages battle theocrats for control of empires, fate itself may give way to **miracles** and **wishes**. In lieu of more traditional effects (e.g. raising the dead), a character casting either of those ritual spells can use them to bring about any vagary of recruitment, vagary of war, or vagary of battle desired, either to benefit the caster’s army or to harm an enemy’s. A **miracle** or **wish** can also be used to undo or avoid an undesirable vagary.

EXAMPLE #1: Quintus’s stronghold is besieged by an army of beastmen. He casts a long-hoarded **wish** spell and calls down an outbreak of plague on the opposing army. The Judge resolves this as a Disease vagary. The resulting epidemic devastates the besieging army, enabling Quintus to sally forth.

EXAMPLE #2: Marcus’s army is trapped in the Waste with enemy straddling its lines of supply. It is too weakened to fight, but if it cannot break through it will starve to death. Marcus’s religious advisor, Balbus, uses a scroll of **miracle** and asks for “manna from heaven” to sustain the army. The Judge resolves the miracle as a Supply Boon vagary (vagary of war 72-76). Bread and water rain from the skies, and Marcus’s well-fed army returns to the attack.

# Chapter 4: Treasure

## Treasure

Treasure —- the wage of heroes! A dragon’s or evil sorcerer-king’s hoard will lay glimmering in the torchlight, coin in uncountable volume like the sands of the desert. Sprinkled among the coin will be goods from exotic lands, trophies of monsters and victories won, and possibly even items of legendary power. Bold adventurers may carry off a few choice items and precious metals, but few parties could plunder the full hoard unless they’ve brought an army.

Along with fame and derring-do, treasure is one of the primary motivations of adventuring parties. Treasure is not only used to retain hirelings and purchase equipment, weapons, vessels, and strongholds; each gold piece worth of treasure brought safely back to civilization gives the character 1 experience point (as described in ***ACKS II******RR***Chapter 6, **Earning Experience from Adventures**). In most campaigns, experience from treasure recovered on adventures will be the main source of character level advancement. In fact, ***ACKS***assumes that 80% of adventuring XP will come from treasure. Therefore, all of the rules herein are designed and intended to generate a total amount of treasure in any given lair or dungeon equal to four times the XP value of the monsters in the area.

**Designer’s Note:** Many ***ACKS***Judges like to adapt adventures from other D20 fantasy games for use with ***ACKS****.* (We do this ourselves for our own home campaigns.) However, when you adapt third-party adventures into ***ACKS****,* be sure to calculate the value of the treasure in those adventures relative to the XP value of the monsters therein. Other D20 fantasy games usually provide much less treasure per monster than ***ACKS***expects. That, in turn, has the unfortunate side-effect of resulting in a much slower advancement curve than ***ACKS***expects. Don’t be alarmed if your players advance in level and wealth in ***ACKS***faster than they do in *OSE* or *LOTFP.* They’re supposed to! Because of its deep campaign rules, ***ACKS***has considerably more activities for high-level player characters to undertake with considerably more “money sinks” to drain their accumulated wealth than any other D20 fantasy game.

### Random Treasure Generation

Treasure will usually be found in the lairs of monsters. Each monster entry in the ***ACKS Monstrous Manual*** designates whether or not that type of monster has the possibility of treasure. Those that do are given a Treasure Type (TT), which indicates what kinds and quantities of treasure a monster might have. On average, the amount of treasure assigned to a monster by its Treasure Type equals four times its XP.

The Treasure Types are lettered from A to R, with TT A yielding the smallest hoards and TT R the largest. In addition to their quantitative rank, the Treasure Types are further sub-divided into three categories, representing the method by which the monsters have accumulated the treasure: by **hoarding**, by **raiding**, or **incidentally**.

* Hoarding monsters are typically intelligent enough to appreciate the value of wealth, and powerful enough to gain and defend substantial amounts of it. Hoarder Treasure Types (B, D, H, N, Q, R) feature a roughly equal mix of coins and other valuables, and typically yield values far in excess of their weight.
* Raiding monsters are intelligent creatures who gather treasure by stealing it from those weaker than themselves. Raiders are often the minions of more powerful monster who claim the most precious items for themselves, so Raider Treasure Types (E, G, J, L, O) are mostly bulky hoards of low value coin and goods.
* Monsters with incidental treasure accumulate wealth accidentally, e.g. by bringing dead adventurers back to the lair to feed their young. Though they may lack the intelligence to recognize things of value, they may be attracted to shiny objects which they gather as best they can with their claws or jaws. The Incidental Treasure Types (A, C, F, I, K, M, P) are usually only a few stone in weight and are the most variable type of treasure, with some rolls on these tables yielding fantastic bounty while as many others produce nothing at all.

Because of how the Treasure Types are structured, a dungeon with a variety of monsters will tend to have a wide assortment of interesting treasures, ranging from precious regalia to bulky low value coin.

You can randomly generate a monster’s treasure using their Treasure Types by rolling on the Treasure Type tables. There are two different Treasure Type tables, the Classic table and the Heroic table. While the tables are equivalent in terms of the total value of treasure provided for each Treasure Type, they differ in two important ways.

The first difference is in the composition of coin. On the Classic table, low-level hoards consisted mostly of common coin (cp and sp), while high-level hoards consisted mostly of precious coin (gp and pp). On the Heroic table, all hoards consist mostly of common coin, with high-level hoards consisting of a lotof common coin with moderate amounts of precious coin. Thus, treasure hoards generated using the Heroic table are considerably larger in total bulk than those generated on the Classic table.

For instance, a dragon hoard (TT R) generated on the Treasure Type (Classic) table would typically contain 1750sp, 2100gp, and 3600pp. The same hoard generated on the Treasure Type (Heroic) table would typically contain 19600cp, 14000sp, 5600ep, 4000gp, and 2625pp. The first hoard is worth 20,275gp and weighs 7.5 stone. The second hoard is worth 21,525gp and weighs 46 stone – seven times as much!

The second difference is in the composition of magic items. On the Classic table, magic items are generated by type (potion, scroll, sword, etc.) while on the Heroic table magic items are generated by rarity (common, rare, etc.). The Classic table tends to provide a great variance in the items that are found. Sometimes low-level monsters may have hoards with powerful magic items, and sometimes high-level monsters may have weak items. The Heroic table tends to provide a greater volume of items with more predictability in power.

Which Treasure Table to use is up to you, the Judge. The Classic table, as the name implies, is intended to offer treasures similar to those found in classic old-school adventurers popular in the 1970s and 1980s. The Heroic table is intended to offer hoards similar to those found in heroic fantasy literature. You can pick one table and use it for your entire campaign.

Unless otherwise noted, randomly generated treasures are found only in the monster’s lair. If the monster entry specifies that a creature carries individual treasure either instead of or in addition to its lair treasure, these individual treasures may be found even if the monster is encountered when wandering outside its lair.

### Planned Treasure Generation

Since the amount of treasure allowed in the campaign directly controls the speed at which the adventurers level, as well as their overall power and capabilities, it is always up to you to determine how much treasure to place into the campaign. As the Judge, you are never “required” to roll for treasure. In fact, there will be many cases where random treasure generation is not the best method to employ. Whenever you deem it necessary or appropriate, you can and should place treasure by hand or amend random treasures you’ve rolled. Particularly important treasures should always be placed by you deliberately; for example, a magic item crafted by a major antagonist should be tailored to the antagonist’s personality and role in the campaign.

When creating a dungeon or other adventure area, one easy way to generate treasure is to calculate the sum of all XP from monsters in the area, and then choose a Treasure Type whose average value is close to four times this sum. If the category of this treasure table (hoarder, raider, or incidental) does not seem appropriate to the area, you can instead choose one or more Treasure Types from the appropriate category that have the closest average value. You then can randomly generate treasure for the area using the selected table. Because probabilities are involved, the result may not match the desired value. If the outcome is too much treasure, you can add more monsters or remove some treasure. If too little treasure results, you can make up the difference with special treasures placed by hand. It is also fine to go with high or low results; over time, the law of averages will assert itself.

EXAMPLE: An underground crypt has been stocked with 20 skeletons (13 XP each), 1 wight (80 XP), 4 giant bats (29 XP each) and 7 pit vipers (3840 XP each), for a total of 722 XP. The crypt treasure should be around four times that total (4 x 722), or 2,888gp. This is close to the 3,250gp average value of Treasure Type I. Treasure Type I is an incidental type treasure, which seems appropriate for the crypt’s burial goods. Using row I on the Treasure Type table, the Judge rolls 2,000 silver pieces and 5 pieces of jewelry, and places some of this treasure in the coffins guarded by the undead and the rest on the corpse of a bandit at the bottom of a pit trap.

### Treasure Type Tables

To use the Treasure Type tables, find the row on your choice of table that corresponds to the monster’s TT. For each column on the row, roll the appropriate dice to determine whether the specified treasure is present, and if so, in what quantity. When the dice indicate that gems, jewelry, or magic items are present, the specific treasures found in these categories are then determined using sub-tables provided after the Treasure Types table. If you wish to create more diverse and interesting treasures, you can then combine the treasure generated into lots and use the Special Treasures table, as described below.

### Treasure Sub-Types

Some types of treasure — gems, jewelry, special treasures, and magic items — require additional rolls to determine exactly what’s in the hoard. Magic items are complex enough to merit their own section (p. XX). Gems, jewelry, and special treasures are detailed below.

###### Gems

When gems are found, you can choose or roll for their value in gold pieces on the **Gem Value** table. You can determine one value for all the games in a treasure hoard, divide the gems up into groups and determine different values for each group, or determine the value of each individual gem, as you prefer. The average value of gems is 200gp per gemstone.

Gems appearing in a treasure hoard might be specified to be ornamentals or brilliants. Ornamentals have a value between 10 - 50gp (average 30gp), and can be randomly generated by rolling 2d20 on the chart below. Brilliants are between 500 - 10,000gp (average 4,000gp), and can be randomly generated by rolling 1d100 + 80. The Treasure Type table uses the most valuable gems to minimize the number of rolls on the gem sub-table for Judges who are randomizing each separately; if you want to create a hoard consisting of more lower value gems, you can convert each brilliant to 11 gems, and each gem to 7 ornamentals.

EXAMPLE: The Judge’s results for TT Q indicate that 3 brilliants are present in a hoard. Seeing that their average value is 5,000gp each, the Judge could actually place this 15,000gp in gems as one 10,000gp flawless blue diamond, three 1,000gp rubies, four 250gp pearls, and ten 10gp quartz crystals, or any other combination desired.

###### Jewelry

Jewelry can vary in value in a similar manner to gems. You can choose or roll for the value of jewelry in a treasure hoard on the **Jewelry Value** table. The average value of jewelry is 1,000gp per piece.

Jewelry appearing in a treasure hoard might be specified to be trinkets or regalia. Trinkets have values of 2-800gp (average 225gp), and can be randomly generated by rolling 2d20 on the chart below. Regalia values range from 1,000-80,000gp (average 12,000gp) and can be randomly generated using 1d100 + 80. The treasure charts give jewelry treasures using the most valuable unit of jewelry for the convenience of randomizing each one separately; if you want to use average values to generate a larger quantity of jewelry, you can convert each piece of regalia to 12 pieces of jewelry, each of which may be in turn converted to 4 trinkets.

###### Special Treasures

Not all treasure should be coin, gems, and jewelry. Ancient cities might hold terracotta pottery or rare dyes and pigments. The tombs of ancient kings might have trinkets of carved ivory. Goblin raiders might have captured spices, silk, or rare furs. These items are called **special treasures**.

To include special treasures in a hoard, first calculate the treasure normally and divide it into lots: 1 piece of jewelry, 1 gem, or 1,000 coins is a lot. Then roll on the table below for each lot of coin, gems, and jewelry and substitute the special treasure rolled for that lot of coin, gems, or jewelry.

EXAMPLE: The Judge has just generated a Type L treasure on the Treasure Type (Classic) table. The hoard consists of 4,000cp; 3,000sp; and 4 pieces of jewelry. The Judge wants to place special treasure, so he converts this into 4 lots of copper, 3 lots of silver, and 4 lots of jewelry. Rolling for the copper lots, the Judge gets a “19”, “10”, “16”, and “15”. Three copper lots stay as coin, while one is replaced by 1d3 barrels amphorae of preserved meat. Rolling for the silver lots, the Judge gets a “75”, “12”, and “2017”, and replaces one of the three lots with 1d3 1d2 sacks of loose herbs. Further rolls indicate that 2 pieces of jewelry become rich fur capes. The Judge makes further sub-rolls, and the final treasure is 3,000cp; 2,000sp; 1 barrel of preserved meat (10gp, 16 stone); 2 sacks of loose herbs (75gp, 5 stone each); 2 pieces of jewelry worth 1,100gp each; and 2 rich fur capes worth 700gp and 1,300gp respectively.

Many of the items appearing as special treasures are designed to be congruent with the types of merchandise appearing on the Merchandise tables in ***ACKS II* *RR*** Chapter 8.Players who are not interested in using the mercantile trading system described in that chapter to maximize the return they achieve from selling special treasures are under no obligation to do so. The value listed for the special treasure is its base value as a trade good, and in general it can be sold for that amount without further thought. However, you are within your rights to decide that a special treasure sells for less, or cannot be sold at all, in a market where the demand for that type of merchandise is low. And players might get inspired to pursue mercantile ventures after observing a merchant’s barely-disguised glee when they sell a special treasure for its base value in a market where demand is high!

## Magic Items

Magic items are the other, even more alluring element of treasure hoards. While characters are not awarded experience points for recovering and keeping magic items, they are highly sought-after nonetheless, as they grant bonuses and special abilities that can give parties a survival edge when they venture into ever more dangerous locations and face mightier monsters.

### Identifying Magic Items

Identifying that an item is magical is relatively straightforward – often the fact that the item is well-preserved when the other items around it are decayed and rusted will be enough. Even the most mundane-looking item can be revealed by a *discern magic* spell.

Identifying what an item is, however, is far more challenging. Depending on their class, level, proficiencies, and hirelings, the player characters might be able to employ some or all of the following methods to identify or at least partly identify an item.

* Any character in the possession of an item with permanent properties that are triggered on use or wear can discover those properties simply by equipping the item and experiencing the effect. He cannot, however, identify other properties of the item (if any) that might require command words or special circumstances. If the item is cursed, the curse will take effect when the character triggers the effect.
* Any character can identify a potion by sipping it to momentarily experience its effect. However, if the potion is poison, the poison will take effect when the character sips it.
* A character proficient with a weapon or suit of armor can identify its magical bonus (if any) by using it in deadly combat for one round or by dedicating one day to training with it. He cannot, however, identify other properties of the item (if any) such as special abilities, charges, or command words. If the item is cursed, the curse will take effect in lieu of the character learning the weapon’s bonus.
* A character proficient in Alchemy can identify a potion by examining its clarity, hue, odor, and viscosity for one turn (10 minutes) and making a successful Alchemy proficiency throw. (If the character fails, he cannot try again on that potion until he has gained a level.)
* A character proficient in Arcane Dabbling can trigger the effects of a miscellaneous magic item, ring, rod, staff, or wand useable by mages by making a successful proficiency throw. However, the character does not learn the effect until after he has triggered it, and on an unmodified roll of 1-3, the effect backfires. The actual command word and charges are not revealed.
* A character proficient in Loremastery can recognize a very rare or legendary magical item and discern its general method of use by examining it for one turn (10 minute) and making a successful proficiency throw. He cannot, however, recognize common, uncommon, or rare items, deduce command words or obscure methods of use, distinguish trapped or cursed items from safe ones, or assess the specific bonus or number of charges remaining in an item. (If the character fails, he cannot try again on that item until he has gained a level.)
* A character proficient in Magical Engineering can recognize a common, uncommon, and/or rare magical item and discern its general method of use by examining it for one turn (10 minutes) and making a successful proficiency throw. He cannot, however, recognize very rare or legendary magical items, deduce command words or obscure methods of use, distinguish trapped or cursed items from safe ones, or assess the specific bonus or number of charges remaining in an item. (If the character fails, he cannot try again on that item until he has gained a level.)
* A character with at least 5 caster levels or Loremastery proficiency can identify any magic item by conducting magic research (see ***ACKS II***p. XX). A successful magical research throw reveals the item’s exact charges, command words, and/or other properties.

When identifying magic items, a character cannot re-roll a failed throw until he gains a level of experience or discovers more information about the item’s properties or maker.

Note that the list above represents only mechanical (rules-based) methods of identifying items. The player characters can and should be able to interrogate prisoners, read captured spellbooks, closely examine wall markings, and undertake other tasks in the game world to aid their identification of an item. For instance, if an enemy mage with a *wand of fireballs* is captured, interrogating the mage might reveal the item’s properties and command word without recourse to expensive magic research. Of course, the mage might lie, or conceal certain properties or curses, etc. Such are the ambiguities that make adventure interesting!

### Using Magic Items

In order to use a magic item, a character must follow any procedures indicated in the item’s description. Some magic items are always in effect, but others may require special actions or concentration. Some magic items have limited uses, called “charges.” When items have charges, each charge can be spent for one instance of magical effect. A character will not know how many charges an item has unless he identified the item with Magic Research. When the charges are all spent the item becomes useless and non-magical. There is no way to “recharge” an item.

### Buying and Selling Magic Items

In any campaign, adventurers will seek to buy and sell magic items. Whether this is possible is entirely up to you based on the characteristics of your campaign setting.

In the Auran Empire campaign setting, buying and selling magic items is possible but difficult. The market for magic items is legally monopolized by the Tower of Knowledge and the various Empyrean Temples. The small number of buyers and sellers makes the market illiquid and inefficient. Most magic items found by adventurers were created long ago, and are of dubious origin and uncertain ownership history, which drives their price down. The majority of new magic items created tend to be for mage’s personal use and research, or commissioned pieces created for exceptionally wealthy patrons. Thus, magic items are generally available for sale only in small quantities, even in large markets. Buyers are equally scarce due to the high cost.

If you decide to permit the adventurers to buy and/or selling of magic items, the number of potential buyers and sellers of magic items in a month will be determined by the type of the items and the market class within which they are sold. The Magic Item Transaction by Market Class table shows the number of potential buyers and sellers for magic items of a given value in a month by market class. Feel free to modify this table if you prefer a larger or smaller market for magic items.

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Magic Item Transaction by Market Class | | | | | | |
| **Magic Item Price** | **Class I** | **Class II** | **Class III** | **Class IV** | **Class V** | **Class VI** |
| 1gp or less | 2,750 | 700 | 425 | 100 | 35 | 15 |
| 2gp-10gp | 300 | 70 | 35 | 10 | 3 | 1 |
| 11-100gp | 20 | 5 | 2 | 1 | 25% | 10% |
| 101-1,000gp | 7 | 2 | 1 | 25% | 10% | 5% |
| 1,001-10,000gp | 2 | 1 | 25% | 10% | 5% | 1% |
| 10,001gp or more | 25% | 10% | 3% | 1% | NA | NA |

###### Selling Magic Items

Adventurers can sell identified magic items found, discovered, looted, or otherwise acquired to the Tower of Knowledge (or your campaign’s equivalent thereof) at a market price equal to base cost. Adventurers can sell magic items they created to the Tower at a market price equal to twice base cost. The difference in market price reflects the difference in value between an item of known make and authenticity and an item of dubious origin and uncertain ownership history. Adventurers can sell items at less than market price in order to increase their chance of selling the item.

By default, magic items sold to the Tower of Knowledge are assumed to be used as samples and, eventually, components for further research and are removed from play. (You can, of course, decide otherwise for any given item).

EXAMPLE: Using a formula, Quintus and his assistants made 4 **scrolls of fireball** (base cost 1,500gp, market price 3,000gp). Quintus also has a **sword +2** he found in an evil crypt (base cost 15,000gp, market price 15,000gp). Quintus has a henchman take these to sell them in Arganos (a Class III market), giving him six months to sell as much as he can. Consulting the Magic Item Transactions by Market Class table, the Judge sees that there is a 25% chance of a buyer for one magic item of between 1,0001 and 10,000gp each month, and a 3% chance for of a buyer for one magic item of 10,001gp or more. The Judge rolls for one buyer for the scrolls in months two, four, and five, but no buyer for the sword. Quintus’ henchman returns with 9,000gp and the remaining unsold scroll and sword.

###### Buying Magic Items

Adventurers can buy pre-existing magic items from the Tower of Knowledge for a market price equal to 225% base cost.

EXAMPLE: Marcus is about to set out on an adventure from Arganos. He decides to buy **potions of healing** (base cost 500gp, market price 1,125gp). Stopping by the local Temple of the Winged Sun, he luckily finds one potion for sale for 1,125gp. Later, Marcus travels to the awe-inspiring city of Aura (Class I market). There he can buy 2 **potions of healing** for 1,125gp each.

###### Commissioning Magic Items

On occasion, adventurers might commission powerful spellcasters to create magic items on their behalf. Spellcasters powerful enough to create magic items for hire can generally only be found in Class I and II markets or through adventures. The advantage to commissioning a magic item is that the item can be made exactly to the adventurer’s specification. The disadvantages are cost and time. The adventurer commissioning the item will be responsible up front for paying the material cost and either paying the component cost or providing the required special components. If the spellcaster successfully completes the item, the adventurer will then be charged the research cost. The total cost will thus be three times the base cost!

EXAMPLE: Marcus hires a mage to create a suit of **plate armor +3** (base cost 35,000gp). After describing the elaborate appearance he demands, Marcus pays 35,000gp for the armor’s material cost. He also delivers the special component, the iron fragments of golems worth 35,000gp, to the mage. When the mage completes the armor, Marcus pays him the research cost of 35,000gp. In all the armor has cost 105,000gp.

###### Magic Item Availability by Market Class (Optional)

In lieu of randomly rolling each month to see what magic items are available for purchase, you can use the optional Magic Item Availability by Market Class table instead. When using this table, you roll once for each market in your setting to determine the number of magic items of each type, and then roll on the appropriate sub-tables to determine the exact nature of each item. These are then the items for sale from the various wizard’s colleges, temples, thieves’ guilds, or other venues in the market.

It’s up to you whether the items for sale change each month. If you want them to change over time, you can use the Magic Item Transactions by Market Class table to estimate the turnover of these items. Often it’s easier to assume they remain for sale until the adventurers purchase them or in-game events dictate otherwise.

**Designer’s Note:** The economically astute reader will already have noticed that magic items cost thrice their base cost to create, but (unless commissioned) only sell for 225% their base cost. This suggests that the majority of magical items are sold at a loss. However, this is not really the case. If you compare the monthly research rate for a spellcaster to the salary of an NPC of the same level, you will see that the monthly research rate is approximately four times the spellcaster’s expected salary. Therefore a spellcaster who sells the items he makes for 225% of their base cost are fully recouping their hard costs and earning a level-appropriate income for the time spent. A spellcaster who sells his items for 300% of their base cost is actually earning more than the norm.

Moreover, there is empirical evidence that magic items would be sold for less than their full cost. That evidence comes from MMORPGs! In such games, just as in ***ACKS****,* “crafters” spend time and money to create items in order to gain experience, then sell those items in various in-game marketplaces. The developers of these MMORPGs have, mostly to their surprise, created functioning markets for goods and services that are nowadays studied (and sometimes supervised) by economists. Surprisingly, in every MMORPG that has ever existed, economists have found that crafters usually sell the items they create at a loss; that is, the price that players charge for the items they create in an MMORPG almost never covers the actual cost of the player’s time and resources in making it (especially considering the opportunity cost of crafting vs grinding).

The reason for this seemingly bizarre discrepancy is that crafters aren’t creating items primarily for profit, they are creating items primarily to “level up” in crafting, because that is the best way to become able to craft better items. This is, of course, the exact equivalent of the campaign XP that spellcasters earn from magic research in ***ACKS***. Because the incentives are identical in both cases, we believe that the magic economy of a fantasy world governed by the ***ACKS***rules would be similar to the magic items economy that has emerged repeatedly in MMORPGs. We therefore assume most spellcasters are happy to sell the items they’ve made at a price just high enough to cover their “hard” expenses (material and component cost) and a reasonable salary.

### Magic Item Descriptions

#### Potions

Potions are found in many sorts of containers, such as ceramic pots and glass or metal flasks. They typically contain a single dose which can affect a single drinker. Most are unlabeled, but can be identified by aroma, taste, or appearance in comparison to other samples. While potions of the same kind made from the same formula will share these features, and potions of similar kind may share similar features (e.g. potions with curative properties frequently are some shade of red), such identification is far from foolproof due to differences of manufacture, unreliability of information, and the wide variety of potions in circulation. Characters with the Alchemy, Dwarven Brewing, or Magical Engineering proficiencies can attempt more precise identifications with the corresponding proficiency throws.

A potion’s effect begins the same round it is quaffed. A potion’s duration is the same as that of the spell it grants, to a maximum of 1d6+6 turns; potions of spells with instantaneous duration (such as healing potions) remain instantaneous. A character who drinks a potion while already affected by another potion is **queasy** for 3 turns or the lesser duration of the two potions (whichever is greater), with both potions’ effects negated during that time.

A potion’s caster level is equal to the minimum caster level required to cast the spell it grants. Potions typically affect the drinker directly; potions allowing the drinker to affect others (such as a **potion of dragon control**) are esoteric. Oils are equivalent to potions but made to be applied topically to a creature or object rather than ingested. Some items listed in this section due to their physical similarity do not follow the above rules and are not true potions (**oil of ooze**, **oil of the secret fire**); they can only be created by spellcasters capable of creating permanent items. Unidentified potions have an apparent value of 25gp unless otherwise noted, comparable to a vial of holy water.

###### Healing Salve

This salve is an enchanted liniment based on camphor, wormwood, and oil. If rubbed on a wound, it heals the creature of 1 point of damage. The salve is found with 1d3+1 doses, but any given creature can only benefit from the salve once per day. Base Cost: 100gp per dose (cantrip). Apparent Value: 25gp.

###### Oil of Extra-Sharpness

This dark oil looks like the sort used to polish weapons and armor, but with a potent metallic smell. If used to oil the blade of an edged or pointed weapon, the weapon is temporarily enhanced to the equivalent of a magic weapon +2; weapons already enchanted gain an additional +1 while oiled. The vial contains enough for 20 arrows, 2 tiny one-handed weapons, or a single small, medium, or large weapon. The oil can also be used in doses of one-third each, in which case it grants only a +1 bonus, as **oil of sharpness**. In either case, the oil will evaporate 3 turns after it is applied. Base Cost: 2,750gp (Single charge 4th level effect, or 3 charges *Sharpness* 1st level effect = effective 5.5th level effect). Apparent Value: 25gp.

###### Oil of Ooze

This malignant grey fluid was first discovered centuries ago in dwarven alchemy labs. Upon escaping its glass flask, the fluid expands to form a highly acidic grey goo. If its command word is spoken as it is poured out, the pourer can control the grey goo by mental command, provided that he concentrates on nothing but controlling the creature. The grey goo lasts for up to a day or until dismissed on the controller’s initiative, upon which it dissolves into water. If the controller’s concentration is broken for any reason, or if the grey goo moves more than 60’ from the controller, control of the grey goo is lost and cannot be regained. The goo will also escape if the flask is left uncapped for more than one consecutive round. An uncontrolled grey goo attacks all creatures in its path until destroyed or dispelled. (For gray goo characteristics, see ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual***, p. XX.) Base Cost: 500gp (Single charge 1st level effect). Apparent Value: 25gp.

###### Oil of the Secret Fire

This bronze flask is sealed with a signet mark of a half-closed eye. It appears to contain good quality lantern oil, which if used normally in a lantern burns as expected for four hours. If instead set in a lantern prepared with a single hair wound about its wick, only the creature from whom the hair came will be able to see its light, his surroundings dimly illuminated to a range of 60’ when to all others the lantern appears dark; this *lightless vision* lasts for a day as the spell. If as many as four total users each contribute a strand of hair the fire’s secret will not last as long; the oil will still burn for four hours but its magical properties will only last for four hours in total. For example, if two users shared a secret fire, it would burn secretly for two hours, then begin shining as a normal lantern for the remaining two. The users would notice no change to the lantern’s illumination (though depending on their location at the time they might notice startled reactions from creatures around them). Base Cost: 2750gp (Choice of 4 charges 1st level effect or *Lightless Vision* 3rd level effect = 5.5th level effect). Apparent Value: 25gp.

###### Potion of Disappearing

This transparent potion contains enough liquid for six sips. If consumed a single sip at a time, the drinker and all his equipment gain the benefit of the *invisibility* spell but lasting for only a single turn. If drank in its entirety, the full effect of the spell takes hold, with the *invisibility* lasting an entire day. In either case, the user becomes visible again after attacking or casting a spell. Base Cost: 3,750gp (6 charges 1st level effect or single charge 3rd level effect = effective 7.5th level effect). Apparent Value: 25gp.

###### Potion of Dragon Control

This murky potion smells of burning flesh and cold sweat. The drinker’s voice becomes enticing and captivating to dragons. By addressing a single dragon within 90’ with riddle-talk he can compel it to obey his commands, as the spell *dominate monster*. The dragon can resist the effect with a successful Spells saving throw. If the dragon’s save fails, the domination lasts as long as the drinker remains within 90’ and continues conversing with the dragon in riddles, requiring his concentration. The dragon will invariably be hostile when the effect ends. Base Cost: 1,000gp (Single charge 2nd level esoteric effect). Apparent Value: 25gp.

###### Potion of Freedom

When imbibed, this woad-blue potion grants the drinker immunity to **paralysis** of any sort. He is entirely unaffected by the spells *halt humanoids* and *cone of paralysis*, by grave ghoul paralysis, by the paralyzing fear of hell hawks, and so on. Base Cost: 2,000gp (Single charge 4th level effect). Apparent Value: 25gp.

###### Potion of Giant Control

Sediment resembling tiny boulders rolls along the bottom of this strong-smelling potion’s flask. The drinker’s voice becomes deep, booming, and impossible for giants to overlook. By boldly addressing a single giant within 90’ with simple and clear orders he can compel it to follow his commands, as the spell *dominate monster*. The giant can resist the effect with a successful Spells saving throw. If it fails, the domination lasts as long as the drinker remains within 90’ and continues to confidently issue easily understood instructions to the giant, requiring his concentration. The giant will invariably be hostile when the effect ends. Base Cost: 1,000gp (Single charge 2nd level esoteric effect). Apparent Value: 25gp.

###### Potion of Hallucination

This cursed potion convinces its drinker that it is actually a different kind of magical potion (Judge’s choice or rolled at random, chosen at item creation). The physical appearance of the potion will be typical for the kind it appears to be: a **potion of hallucination (recuperation)** will appear as frothy apple cider, a **potion of hallucination (youth)** will smell of spring flowers, and so on. The potion imposes a powerful hallucination upon its wearer: a dynamic, multisensory illusion with no save permitted to disbelieve it unless he has the Illusion Resistance proficiency. The drinker will believe he is seeing, hearing, and feeling the effects he expects the potion to have, and find this hallucination so compelling that he cannot be convinced otherwise; in response to attempts to persuade him of his delusion, the drinker will typically provide an endless amount of rebuttals, excuses, and annoying refusals to listen. The hallucination will persist for the duration of the potion it pretends to be (maximum 1d6+6 turns), or until the drinker is **dispelled** or receives a *remove curse* spell. Base Cost: 500gp (Single charge 1st level effect). Apparent Value: 25gp.

###### Potion of Passion

This clear potion tastes slightly sweet in a way easily covered by other flavors. A humanoid drinker with fewer than 5 HD will spend the following day enamored with the next creature he lays eyes upon, as the spell *beguile humanoid*. If the creature he sees happens to be of compatible stock and sex, the potion takes far stronger hold; it will affect a drinker with fewer than 9 HD and leave him potentially smitten for months, as the spell *bewitch humanoid*. The drinker is permitted a Spells saving throw to resist the effect in either case. Base Cost: 1,250gp (Single charge choice of *Bewitch Humanoid* 2nd level effect or *Beguile Humanoid* 1st level effect = effective 2.5th level effect). Apparent Value: 25gp.

###### Potion of Recuperation

This bubbly potion smells of apple cider just beginning to ferment. The drinker of this potion will heal 3d6+3 points of damage, in the same manner as the spell *cure serious injury*. This potion may instead be sipped for a partial dose, with each third of a vial healing 1d6+1 points of damage as the spell *cure light injury*. Base Cost: 2,750gp (Single charge *Cure Serious Injury* 4th level effect, or 3 charges *Cure Light Injury* 1st level effect = effective 5.5th level effect). Apparent Value: 25gp.

###### Potion of Supreme Valiance

This potent blood-red drought tastes of the gods’ nectar to true warriors, but smells of carrion to lesser men. If the drinker is a fighter (or other character with equal or better attack progression), he will find his hand steadied, his eye sharp, and his body and spirit invigorated. For one turn, he becomes **immune** to fear effects, receives a +2 bonus to all attack throws, damage rolls, and saving throws, and gains 2d8 temporary hit points. The empowered hero is compelled to fight with heroic honor by attacking directly without retreat, in the same manner as the Berserkergang proficiency. Hit points gained due to this potion are temporary and are lost first on injury, unable to be healed. Base Cost: 3,000gp (Single charge 6th level effect). Apparent Value: 25gp.

###### Potion of Valiance

This flask of clear liquid warms like heady liquor when drank by a warrior, while to all others it tastes of sweat and grime. If the drinker is a fighter (or other character with equal or better attack progression), he will find his hand steadied, his eye sharp, and his body and spirit invigorated. For one turn, he becomes **immune** to fear effects, receives a +1 bonus to all attack throws, damage rolls, and saving throws, and gains 1d8 temporary hit points. The empowered hero is compelled to fight with heroic honor by attacking directly without retreat, in the same manner as the Berserkergang proficiency. Hit points gained due to this potion are temporary and are lost first on injury, unable to be healed. Base Cost: 1,500gp (Single charge 3rd level effect). Apparent Value: 25gp.

###### Potion of Youth

This potion smells of flowers and the early days of spring. Its drinker becomes 10 years younger, potentially reducing attribute penalties from age (though his age will not regress earlier than mid-adolescence). There is a cumulative 1% chance each time a person consumes such a potion for all effects from previously consumed **potions of youth** to be undone, causing the drinker’s age to suddenly revert to what it would be without their effects. A person raised to or above the maximum age for his race immediately perishes. Base Cost: 50,000gp (single charge 7th level esoteric ritual effect). Apparent Value: 25gp.

#### Rings

All magical rings are usable by any character class. To function, magic rings must worn on a digit of the hands only (fingers or thumb) or worn pierced through the flesh (like an earring). Regardless of where they are worn, a creature can only benefit from two magical rings at the same time; if more than two are worn, none off the rings function.

A ring’s caster level is equal to the minimum caster level required to cast the spell it grants. Anytime a spell cast from a ring triggers a Spells saving throw, the target makes an Implements saving throw instead. Paralysis, Death, or Blast saving throws are not replaced by Implements saving throws, however.

###### Anti-Magic

The wearer of this smooth black jade ring is protected by a 10’ radius barrier that stops any spell or spell-like effects from coming in or going out, including the wearer’s. Spell-like effects include all effects that duplicate a spell, or magical effects that are resisted with an Implements save, but excludes effects that do not duplicate a spell and are resisted with Death, Blast, or Paralysis saves. Spells with a range of “self,” or “touch” spells used on the wearer himself, are not blocked by the ring’s barrier. If a creature or item with ongoing spells or spell-like effects touches the barrier, it is dispelled as if by a *dispel magic* spell from the wearer, with the wearer treated as having a caster level of 11 for this purpose. Permanent effects or effects which cannot be dispelled are not affected, and the *anti-magic sphere*created by the ringcannot itself be dispelled. Base Cost: 72,000gp (permanent (1/hour) *Anti-Magic Sphere* 6th level effect). Apparent Value: 450gp.

###### Beast Control

This golden ring bears the shape of a lion’s roaring head, its mane sweeping back on both sides to form the band. Once per turn the wearer may command 1d4 living animal targets within 45’, as the spell *dominate beasts*. Each target that fails a Spells saving throw will obey the wearer’s mental commands as long as he maintains concentration, or until they cease being in range or are *dispelled*. After the effect ends the targets will invariably be hostile to the wearer. Base Cost: 33,000gp (1/turn *Dominate Beasts* 2nd level effect). Apparent Value: 600gp.

###### Feebleness

These cursed rings are often made to be mistaken for others and can take any form, but are typically a plain gold or silver band. Upon putting on the ring the wearer must succeed on a Spells saving throw or have his body and mind wracked with weakness. His highest physical ability score (STR, DEX, or CON) will be halved, and he will lose a rank of his mostly highly skilled general proficiency (if multiple proficiencies are tied, he loses the one he most relies on). This effect cannot be **dispelled**, but can be ended by *remove curse*. The ring only functions once; whether the victim makes or fails his saving throw the ring is thereafter non-magical. Base Cost: 1,500gp (Single charge *Bestow Curse* 3rd level effect). Apparent Value: 400gp.

###### Fire Protection

This ring is crafted from the polished blackened knucklebone of a red dragon. Its wearer is **immune** to mundane fire damage and automatically succeeds on associated saving throws. He is **resistant** to extraordinary fire damage, reducing damage by half and receiving a +2 bonus on associated saving throws. Base Cost: 24,000gp (Permanent (1/hour) *Energy Protection* 2nd level effect). Apparent Value: 40gp.

###### Genie Summoning

Set with small white sapphires, this silver ring can be used to summon a jann, a majestic genie of elemental air (see ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual*** for details). The ring is activated by rubbing it and whispering a command word; once summoned the jann remains for one day or until destroyed, dismissed, or **dispelled**. The jann will obey the wearer’s verbal commands obediently but not loyally, twisting any ambiguities in its orders. A jann with a neutral or better reaction roll usually only seeks to embarrass and annoy the wearer, but an unfriendly or hostile jann will find a variety of ways to sabotage the wearer’s efforts. The ring can be activated but once per week, summoning a different jann each time. Base Cost: 18,000gp (1/week 6th level effect). Apparent Value: 1,000gp.

###### Hallucination

This cursed ring convinces its wearer that it is actually a different kind of magical ring (Judge’s choice or rolled at random, chosen at item creation). The physical appearance of the ring will be typical for the item it appears to be: a **ring of hallucination (invisibility)** will gleam red in firelight, a **ring of hallucination (protection)** will be a signet ring, and so on. The ring imposes a powerful hallucination upon its wearer: a dynamic, multisensory illusion with no save permitted to disbelieve it unless he has the Illusion Resistance proficiency. The wearer will believe he is seeing, hearing, and feeling the effects he expects the ring to have, and find this hallucination so compelling that he cannot be convinced otherwise; in response to attempts to persuade him of his delusion, the wearer will typically provide an endless number of rebuttals, excuses, and annoying refusals to listen. The ring’s delusion affects the first person to wear it each week, and persists indefinitely even if the ring is removed unless the wearer is **dispelled** or receives a *remove curse* spell. Base Cost: 3,000gp (1/week 1st level effect). Apparent Value: as ring imitated.

###### Humanoid Control

This cold iron ring is fashioned in the shape of a clenched fist. Once per turn the wearer may command any living humanoid target within 45’, as the spell *dominate humanoid*. If the target fails a Spells saving throw he will obey the wearer’s mental commands for as long as the wearer maintains concentration, or until he ceases being in range or is **dispelled**. After the effect ends the target will invariably be hostile to the wearer. Base Cost: 33,000gp (1/turn *Dominate Humanoid* 2nd level effect). Apparent Value: 90gp.

###### Invisibility

This stout gold ring gleams red when seen by the light of a flame. With a twist of the ring, the wearer and all he carries become invisible, as the spell *invisibility*. The wearer becomes visible at the end of his initiative if he casts a spell or attacks a creature while invisible or if he is **dispelled**, but can activate the ring’s power again one turn later. Base Cost: 49,500gp (1/turn *Invisibility* 3rd level effect). Apparent Value: 350gp.

###### Plant Control

This ring is cut from green jade and set with interwoven vines of silver and gold. Once per turn the wearer may command any number of living plant targets within 60’, as the spell *dominate plants*. Ordinary plants are automatically affected, with all others resisting the effect on a successful Spells saving throw. Affected plants will obey the wearer’s mental commands until he ceases concentration or the effect is **dispelled**. Plants will gain some mobility, with branches and vines able to move to restrain and hinder the movement of others and perform similar actions, though they will not gain any ability to uproot themselves. After the effect ends any affected sapient plants will be hostile to the caster, while ordinary plants will return to their normal (lack of) behavior. Base Cost: 82,500gp (1/turn *Dominate Plants* 5th level effect). Apparent Value: 900gp.

###### Protection

These rings are typically crafted as a solid gold signet ring bearing a royal or patrician family seal. The wearer receives a bonus to his AC and all saving throws, which stacks with worn armor and any other enhancements to AC and saving throws. Most of these rings provide a +1 bonus, but some crafted with greater power impart a +2 or +3 bonus; a rare number of these greater rings also apply their bonus to saving throws to all creatures within a 5’ radius of the wielder, be they friend or foe. Ring +1 Base Cost: 12,000gp (permanent (1/hour) 1st level effect), Ring +2 Base Cost: 24,000 (permanent (1/hour) *Shimmer* 2nd level effect), Ring +2, 5’ radius. Base Cost: 36,000gp (permanent (1/hour) 3rd level effect), Ring +3 Base Cost: 48,000gp (permanent (1/hour) 4th level effect), Ring +3, 5’ radius. Base Cost: 60,000gp (permanent (1/hour) 5th level effect). Apparent Value: 250gp.

###### Queen’s Heart

According to legend, this bejeweled band was gifted by the goddess Nasga to her priestess Semiramis, the first sorceress-queen of Zahar. Though many of the hundred suitors who courted her attempted to succeed by sorcery, they found it to no avail: the wearer of the ringis completely **immune** to enchantment spells and effects as well as the influence of Mystic Aura. Once per turn by kissing the ring, the wearer gains *invisibility*,as the spell. Base Cost: 121,500gp (permanent (1/hr) 6th level effect 72,000gp, 1/turn *Invisibility* 3rd level effect 49,500gp). Apparent Value: 4,000gp.

###### Regeneration

This powerful ring was carved from the eye tooth of a great troll chieftain and boiled in the blood of his entire tribe to imbue it with power. The wearer of the ring regenerates 3 hp per round, as the spell *trollblood*. This regeneration is unending, even restoring mortal wounds; severed limbs will even crawl back to the wearer’s body and reattach as soon as they make contact. The ring only regenerates damage and mortal wounds suffered while it is worn, with other lasting wounds continuing to ache, bleed or fester. Injuries caused by fire or acid damage will never be regenerated, and magic or effects such as *extinguish life* that instantly slay the wearer affect him as normal. Base Cost: 150,000gp (Permanent (1/turn) *Trollblood* 6th level effect). Apparent Value: 60gp.

###### Seal of Chaos

This mighty signet ring is forged of adamant and hepatizon; in lieu of mortal heraldry its seal bears symbols of the chthonic powers. Its wearercan *speak with beasts*,as the spell. Bound to the ring are eight incarnations of varying power from the chthonic and elemental spheres, though legends vary greatly as to the specific incarnations and their powers. The wearer can conjure each of these incarnations once per day by speaking its name and concentrating, as the spells *conjure cacodemon spawn, conjure imp, conjure hellion, conjure incubus, conjure dybbuk, conjure fiend, conjure supreme elemental*,and *conjure genie*. If the wearer loses concentration or an incarnation is forced out of range, the wearer will lose control of the incarnation. It will then attempt to attack the wearer and all others in its path until banished, or until it departs 1d3 turns later; tales say such was the doom of several of the ring’s former masters. Unlike the spells, the ring’s incarnations can still be conjured the next day even if they were not safely dispelled previously. When the ring is found, the Judge should name each incarnation, roll or choose the type of elemental and genie, and roll or choose the form and special abilities of each cacodemon. Base Cost: 184,000gp (permanent (1/hour) *Speak With Beasts* 2nd level effect 24,000gp, 1/day *Conjure Fiend* 6th level effect 30,000gp, 1/day *Conjure Genie* 6th level effect 30,000gp, 1/day *Conjure Dybbuk* 5th level effect 25,000gp, 1/day *Conjure Supreme Elemental* 5th level effect 25,000gp, 1/day *Conjure Incubus* 4th level effect 20,000gp, 1/day *Conjure Hellion* 3rd level effect 15,000gp, 1/day *Conjure Imp* 2nd level effect 10,000gp, 1/day *Conjure Cacodemon Spawn* 1st level effect 5,000gp). Apparent Value: 8,000gp.

###### Telekinetic Force

This ring is carved from a single large amethyst, purple at its center with streaks of white crystal overlapping in a braid just under the band’s surface. The wearer feels potential connections reaching from his hand in all directions, as strings waiting to be pulled taut. With concentration he can move one chosen creature or object within 180’ weighing up to 54 stone, as the spell *telekinesis*. Each round he can move the target up to 20’ in any direction. Unwilling creatures targeted by or holding an object targeted by the wearer may resist the effect with a successful Spells saving throw. The wearer may cease or resume concentration at will, but affected targets will plummet from the air in the interim, and unwilling targets are permitted a saving throw each time he attempts to take hold of them telekinetically. Base Cost: 95,000gp (Permanent (1/turn) *Telekinesis* 5th level effect). Apparent Value: 6,000gp.

###### Water Walking

This thin gold ring has an inner band of perfectly clear glass, making the gold seem to float about the wearer’s finger. The wearer can walk on water as if it were solid land. He can freely attack those in or below the water, the water only acting solid for the limbs supporting his weight. He may freely choose to swim or otherwise submerge himself, but doing so will end the ring’s effect until he is again entirely above the surface; he cannot use it while submerged or partially submerged to propel himself upwards. Base Cost: 36,000gp (permanent (1/hour) *Water Walking* 3rd level effect). Apparent Value: 300gp.

###### Wishes

A perfect unmarked golden band made from otherworldly metal, this ring’s very existence is an imposition upon the natural order. To hold such a ring is to feel the weight of the sky as if it were crashing down on one’s head; to wear it is to feel the power to hold up the heavens. The ring contains 1d4 charges of the ritual spell *wish*, each able to alter reality in sweeping ways as the spell. Even among the greatest of mages in history, few have possessed the power and skill necessary to craft such a ring; the number among those who would dare the risk can likely be counted on one hand. While history and myth record several such rings, the difficulty of its creation and the strain such concentrated power puts on the world make it unlikely that more than one*ring of wishes* has ever existed at the same time. Base Cost: 800,000gp (4 charges *Wish* 9th level esoteric ritual effect). Apparent Value: 1,000gp, but obviously magical once touched.

###### X-Ray Vision

This silver ring bears a smoky topaz carved as a closed eye, with a disc of blue jade set beneath it as an iris. Once per turn the wearer may close his eyes to see from the ring, as the spell*x-ray vision*. By concentrating for the turn he may investigate an immediate area of up to 10’ x 10’ x 10’, discerning all hidden and concealed objects and features. He can see the contents of containers as well as any secret doors or traps, though seeing the internal mechanisms of locks and triggers will not necessarily allow him to work them. The*x-ray vision* can see through most materials but is blocked by even a thin layer of bone or metal. Base Cost: 82,500gp (1/turn *X-Ray Vision* 5th level esoteric effect). Apparent Value: 1,100gp.

#### Scrolls

Most scrolls are pieces of parchment, imbued with the magical writings of a spell or other magical effect. These writings are potent in that they simply require the pronunciation of their words to release their power. Scrolls are usually written in obscure or dead languages. You can choose the language in which the scroll is written, or roll on the table below.

Scrolls are sheets of papyrus or parchment imbued with enchanted writing. Reading these magical words aloud releases the power of one of the scroll’s inscribed spells or effects. Reading a scroll requires declaration before initiative and can be disrupted in the same manner as spellcasting; if disrupted, the spell is lost from the scroll.

Scrolls are often found written in dead or esoteric languages; you can choose each scroll’s language, or roll on Scroll Languages table, below, to decide. A character must be able to read the language in which the scroll is written in order to use it, unless he has the Scrollreading power. Spells from a scroll have the minimum caster level necessary for each spell. The apparent value of an unidentified scroll roll is 150gp.

###### Spell Scroll

A spell scroll will be found with a total number of spell levels on it equal to the amounted noted on the treasure table entry. Spell scrolls are split between arcane and divine, containing spells from the corresponding spell list. A character must have a spell on their class spell list in order to cast it from a scroll, but does not have to have it in their repertoire, nor be high enough level to cast it normally. A spell’s magical sigils vanish from the scroll when it is used.

When determining the contents of a spell scroll, first determine if it is an Arcane or Divine spell scroll, with even chance for each. Next, roll on the Spell Level by Total Spell Levels Remaining of Scroll table to determine the levels of the spells it contains, rolling as many times as needed and changing columns as appropriate. After determining the levels of the spells on the scroll, choose or roll for each spell on the appropriate spell repertoire list (see ***ACKS II Rules Revision*** Chapter 5: Spells). For a divine scroll you can either choose a single divine class to represent the creator of the scroll, or roll on the overall Divine Spell List; unusual combinations resulting from the latter option can be assumed to be the product of a syncretic or unknown sect. Individual spells on a scroll can still be used by any divine caster who has them in their class repertoire regardless of the scroll’s other contents. Apparent Value: 150gp.

###### Cursed Scroll

The reader of this scroll must immediately make a Death saving throw. On a failure, he is afflicted with a terrible curse, as the spell *bestow curse*. Any effect that would be appropriate for the spell might be found on such a scroll, but as those who make such scrolls strive to be as creative and cruel as possible the Judge is likewise encouraged to innovate. The curse may only be removed with the spell *remove curse*. Creatures unable to read the scroll do not trigger its effect. Base Cost: 1500gp (Single charge *Bestow Curse* 3rd level effect). Apparent Value: 150gp.

###### Scroll of Creature Warding

When read, this scroll produces a 10’ radius area of protection around the wearer, moving with him. The specified type of creature cannot enter the warded area, though they can still attack with spells, missile weapons, special abilities, and so on. The effect ends after 6 turns, or if any protected creature makes a melee attack against a creature of that type. It can be read by anyone literate in the appropriate language. The Judge can choose which creature type the scroll wards against, or roll on the Creature Type table on p. xx. Base Cost: 500gp (Single charge 1st level effect). Apparent Value: 150gp.

###### Scroll of Magic Warding

When read, this scroll produces a 10’ radius area of protection around the wearer, moving with him, as the spell *anti-magic sphere*. Spells and spell-like effects can not pass through the sphere, and any creatures or items passing through the barrier are dispelled as if by the spell *dispel magic*. The sphere persists for 12 turns, until dispelled, or until the reader of the scroll chooses to end the effect. It can be read by anyone literate in the appropriate language. Base Cost: 3,000gp (Single charge *Anti-Magic Sphere* 6th level effect). Apparent Value: 150gp.

###### Treasure Map

A treasure map leads to a hoard of the amount indicated. The Judge should determine the map’s destination and specifics based off this amount; for example, a map leading to a hoard of Treasure Type Q might lead to the lair of a Mummy Lord (a monster with Treasure Type Q). The detail given on the treasure itself can range from a general estimate of total value, to a detailed accounting with identification of and command words for magic items. All treasure maps will lead to the general vicinity of the treasure, though this might vary from leading to another room in the dungeon in which the map is found, to pointing the way to a small valley many leagues away in which the entrance to a lair is located. Beyond this the information contained in a map will vary, with some including a detailed map of the destination structure, locations of secret doors or traps, descriptions of guardians, passwords, or other clues. A treasure map may utilize unusual languages, codes, or hidden notes to keep some or all of its information safe, which must first be deciphered in order to use it. The Judge can choose to develop the map based on treasure or lairs already placed in their region, or roll on the Treasure Map Contents and Clue Specifics tables to randomly generate a map.

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Treasure Map Contents** | | |
| **Roll d6** | **Location** | **# of Clues** |
| 1 | Adjacent | 0 |
| 2 | Nearby | 1 |
| 3 | Nearby | 1 |
| 4 | Distant | 2 |
| 5 | Distant | 2 |
| 6 | Very distant | 3 |

If randomly generating a map, the Judge should roll a d6 twice on the Treasure Map Contents table to determine the general distance to the hoard and the number of clues the map contains. Distances rolled are broad and should be considered in light of the size of the hoard; a small adjacent hoard might be only a few rooms from where the map was found in a dungeon, whereas a large hoard might be at the bottom level; similarly, a result of “very distant” might vary from being hundreds of miles away to being on the far end of the world.

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Clue Specifics** | | | |
| **Roll d6** | **Detail** | **Content** | **Obscurity** |
| 1 | Brief | Local map of site or surrounding area | Obvious |
| 2 | Brief | Monsters present at or near hoard | Obvious |
| 3 | Moderate | Traps/hazards other than monsters | Coded |
| 4 | Moderate | Secret passages or doors | Coded |
| 5 | Detailed | Further details about treasure | Coded |
| 6 | Very detailed | Further details about treasure | Concealed |

For each clue, roll 1d6 three times on the Clue Specifics table to determine how detailed the clue is, what type of information it provides, and how apparent it is. For example, a brief obvious clue about monsters might simply be a basic note saying “beware the demon”; a very detailed concealed clue might detail the presence of a bound wyverine hellion named Bakl with magic resistance and a poisonous bite who will appear once the treasure is touched, in ink only visible while the map is gently heated. A local map might show the area around a distant lair or dungeon, an interior floor map of a lair or portion of a dungeon, or diagrams of noteworthy rooms. A brief mention of secret ways and traps might represent cryptic suspicions about a possible trapdoor; moderate to detailed knowledge might grant precise knowledge of mechanisms and destinations; while very detailed might provide passwords, keys, or other special means to access or bypass them. All maps should include at least the general value of the hoard; a brief treasure clue can further detail the rough volume and kind of goods present while a very detailed clue can give a full inventory, including the nature of any magic items involved and their method of activation. For coded or concealed clues the Judge can devise each clue’s ciphering or masking himself, or roll on the Clue Code and Clue Concealment tables, respectively.

EXAMPLE 1: Mandalfus obtains a map to a Treasure Type R. Rolling to generate the map, the Judge gets a result of Distant with 3 clues. The Judge decides the map leads to the lair of a monster with a type R hoard hundreds of miles away, settling on a very old red dragon who will reside in a destroyed dwarven vault. Rolling for the first clue results in a detailed obvious clue about monsters present, and the Judge decides the map includes an image of the dragon breathing fire while flying over the vault with a note “200 BE.” Thus the clue reveals the dragon’s age, body type and two of its special abilities. The second clue is a brief obvious clue about secret passages, and he decides the map will reveal the presence of a secret door into the vault, but give no further information about its location or how to open it. The last clue is a very detailed concealed clue about secret passages; he decides this will expand on the previous clue by including a key to the secret door along with exact information about how and when it can be used. Rolling on the Clue Concealment table, he gets a result of Moon Ink visible under a crescent moon. If Mandalfus uncovers the secret message, his expedition to retrieve the hoard will have less chance of ending in a fiery death.

EXAMPLE 2: Viggo finds a map to a Treasure Type B while in a dungeon. The Judge rolls to generate the map and gets a result of Adjacent with 1 clue. Rolling for the clue results in a moderate coded clue about traps. The Judge checks his dungeon notes and decides the map points to a statue elsewhere on the level with 500gp of gems cached inside along with a poison gas trap. Viggo is unable to decipher the clue but proceeds to the room anyways, deduces the treasure’s hiding spot, and smugly smashes apart the statue to claim his prize. As a toxic cloud surrounds him, Viggo wonders where it all went wrong…

If characters wish to buy or sell a treasure map, the price will vary considerably based on the usefulness of the map’s clues, the expected difficulty of obtaining the treasure based on distance and any known hazards or guardians, the presence of a particularly desirable artifact in the hoard, and many other possible factors. In general, a typical price for a “useful” map is approximately one-quarter of the hoard’s expected total value of mundane and magic treasure. However, a map with multiple copies in circulation is considered nearly worthless by most prospective NPC buyers. Prior to buying a map, NPCs will typically demand proof via magic or other means that the map is unique, authentic, and that its treasure has not already been plundered. An unidentified or undeciphered treasure map has an apparent value of 150gp.

#### Implements

Implements consist of rods, staffs, and wands. Physically, these three types of magic items differ primarily in size. Wands are small and thin, being about 18” in length and only 1/4” to 1/2” in diameter. Staffs are much larger, being 6’ in length and up to 2” in diameter. Rods are somewhere in-between these two kinds of items, being about 3’ in length and 1/2” to 1” in diameter. Wands and rods weigh 1/6 st. (e.g. count as one item) but staffs weigh 1 st.

Rods are sometimes usable by any class, but many are restricted to use by certain classes only. Wands are only usable by arcane spellcasters such as mages or elven spellswords. Staffs are usable by either arcane or divine spellcasters, depending on the kind of staff.

Each of these magic items generally uses a **charge** when its effect is triggered, and each item has a limited number of charges. A wand can be made with between 10 to 20 charges and found with 2d10 remaining. A rod can be created with between 6 to 12 charges, and found with 2d6 remaining. A staff can be made with between 15 to 30 charges and found with 3d10 charges.

Spells from a wand function at +1 caster level higher than the minimum required to cast them, spells from a rod at +2 caster levels higher, and spells from a staff at +3 caster levels higher. Some items listed in this section due to their physical similarity do not follow the above rules (**staff of the healer**, all ritual implements); as they are not true implements, they do not gain the bonus to caster level.

Anytime a spell cast from an implement triggers a Spells saving throw, the target makes an Implements saving throw instead. Paralysis, Death, or Blast saving throws are not replaced by Implements saving throws, however.

###### Rod of Cataclysm

Imperial history exists in in the aftermath of the Day Without Night, an apocalyptic event in which all prior history was reduced to ash and scattered to the wind. Sages of ancient history speculate whether the Day Without Night might have been brought about by the rod of cataclysm or similar artifacts; one legend describes such devices as the vast branches of a dark forest, seeded to end the world by an evil too great to look upon. Most agree this is a poetic turn invoking the rod’s age and calamitous power, as the cost to craft the rod would cause even an emperor to blanche, to say nothing of the dire notion of more than one such artifact existing. The rod is made of solid metal, a dense and dull platinum-like surface inlaid with a harder steel-gray. It is inscribed with abstract circles and portions thereof; despite appearing in no known languages, they impart a message of danger to any sentient creature seeing them. By tracing the entirety of the rod’s inscriptions, its wielder will invoke the ritual spell *cataclysm*. Unless the *cataclysm* is prevented by a *wish* or *miracle* or by the rod’s destruction, it will bring tremendous destruction against the targeted domain one week later. Along with its normal restrictions, the rod cannot be used against a domain with a ruler faithful to the Chthonic gods. The rod is found with 1d6 of its original six ruinous charges remaining. Base Cost: 1,200,000gp (6 charges *Cataclysm* 9th level esoteric ritual effect). Apparent Value: 500gp

###### Rod of Eternal Torture

This black iron rod is topped with a blood-stained bulbous tip and capped with a forked spike. Select servants of the sorcerer-kings of Zahar carried such dread devices to wrack the bodies and spirits of their foes, letting their lasting torment serve as a warning to any who might defy them. Any spellcaster can activate the rod by speaking the word ‘suffer’ in Ancient Zaharan, to expend a charge and disfigure a creature within 45’ as the spell *disfigure body and soul*. Only the magic of a creature with a caster level of 14 or higher can reverse the rod’s terrible effects. Base Cost: 36,000gp (12 charges *Disfigure Body and Soul* 6th level effect). Apparent Value: 35gp.

###### Rod of Nullification

At the end of this 2’ long ivory rod is an silver cap engraved with a broken circle. When any wielder speaks the rod’s command word it will instantly and permanently remove all powers from a magic item with a base cost of up to 200,000gp which is touched to the cap, with no saving throw permitted. Using the rod on an item held or worn by an unwilling target requires a successful attack throw. The rod can only be used once, its charge wasted if used in an unsuccessful attack. Base Cost: 100,000gp (single charge *Cancellation* 8th level esoteric ritual effect). Apparent Value: 2,000gp.

###### Rod of Resurrection

This 3’ long septagonal rod is comprised of unblemished platinum, on each side a prayer to one of the seven Empyrean gods flawlessly engraved and inlaid with gold. Each Empyrean god has granted a great boon to the mortal world in the creation of this item, from Ammonar the Lawbringer to Türas the Judge of Valor. The rod may be used a total of seven times by a divine spellcaster to return life to those that have fallen, restoring them perfectly from even the smallest portion of their remains as the ritual spell *resurrection*. Each *resurrection* is tied to a particular god and is best used on one of that god’s true believers, or at least a person who exemplified the qualities they most favor; using the rod on someone else will work, but at the Judge’s discretion may require a *quest* by the recipient for the god in question. The exact history of the rod’s prior use is uncertain, as the difference between *resurrection* and lesser magic is often only known to the newly-risen man who struggles with the after-effects of escaping death’s grasp; the rod is found with 1d6+1 charges remaining. Base Cost: 700,000gp (7 charges Resurrection 8th level esoteric ritual effect). Apparent Value: 7,000gp.

###### Staff of Domination

This narrow staff is made of blackened iron with chain-links of platinum set into its length. The wielder finds himself the prospective master of every natural living creature he encounters. Upon activation by an arcane spellcaster the staff expends a charge and allows the user to control his choice of another humanoid, a number of beasts, or an area of plants, as the respective spells *dominate humanoid, dominate beasts,* or *dominate plants*. Base Cost: 97,500gp (30 charges choice of *Dominate Plants* 5th level effect, *Dominate Humanoid* 2nd level effect, *Dominate Beasts* 2nd level effect = 6.5th level effect). Apparent Value: 800gp.

###### Staff of Elemental Air

Fastened from a thin length of willow, this staff is decorated with slim slivers of opal set after the shape of a roiling storm, a crystal orb in its head cradling a few flower petals in an ever-swirling wind; it serves as a reservoir of the might of the sphere of elemental air. This staff is one of the four Staffs of Elemental Power, created by elven wizards of Argollë at the height of that kingdom’s might. The staff can be activated by an arcane spellcaster via command word to expend a charge and cast any one of the following spells:*control weather, control winds, summon weather, cloud of poison*. Base Cost: 153,750gp (30 charges choices of *Control Weather* 6th level esoteric effect, *Control Winds* 5th level esoteric effect, *Summon Weather* 5th level esoteric effect, *Cloud of Poison* 4th level effect = effective 10.25 level esoteric effect). Apparent Value: 11,000gp.

###### Staff of Elemental Earth

Made of strong and unyielding oak, this staff is decorated with panels of precious metals set in an precise manner, a crystal orb in its head cradling an unmoving piece of polished granite; it serves as a reservoir of the might of the sphere of elemental earth.

###### Staff of Elemental Fire

Formed from a limb of red ash, this staff is decorated with triangular obsidian medallions set in sharp angles, a crystal orb in its head cradling an ever-smoldering piece of coal; it serves as a reservoir of the might of the sphere of elemental fire. This staff is one of the four Staffs of Elemental Power, crafted by elven fire-mages of Argollë at the noontide of that kingdom’s glory. The staff can be activated by an arcane spellcaster via command word to expend a charge and cast any one of the following spells***:*** *conflagration, firestorm, selective fire, inferno*.

Apparent Value: 11,000gp.

###### Staff of Elemental Water

Made of grey wood with a slightly blue tint, the staff is decorated with small pieces of aquamarine set in flowing patterns, a crystal orb in its head cradling an ever-churning sphere of water; it serves as a reservoir of the might of the sphere of elemental water. This staff is one of the four Staffs of Elemental Power, shaped by elven elementalists of Argollë at the crest of that kingdom’s expanse. The staff can be activated by an arcane spellcaster via command word to expend a charge and cast any one of the following spells: *level water, capsizing wave, ice storm, weave water*.

Apparent Value: 11,000gp.

###### Staff of the Archmage

Oft considered the finest arcane implement ever made, this **staff +1** is formed from bone taken from the largest wing-spur of an ancient red dragon, topped with an emerald the size of a closed fist, and so intricately inlaid with platinum wire that the untrained eye slips when attempting to examine it. It was crafted by the legendary mage Süreus whose detractors claim that the staff’s expense harmed relations between the Tower of Knowledge and the Imperial treasurers for over a generation. The staff puts an immense array of spells at an arcane spellcaster’s command. By expending a charge its wielder can call upon any function of the **staff of the mage**, or can form a tunnel through any wall softer than metal as the spell *passageway*, *control weather* as the spell, form and compel portions of the primal spheres as the spell *conjure supreme elemental*, or halt all creatures in a 60’ long and 30’ wide cone as the spell *cone of paralysis*. Alternatively, expending a charge will allow the wielder to make himself or another creature or object unseen as the spell *invisibility*, to allow a touched creature to soar through the air as the spell *flight*, or to trap others to the ground as the spell *webbing*. Base Cost: 213,125gp (Staff +1 5,000gp, 30 charges choice of *Control Weather* 6th level esoteric effect, *Passageway* 6th level esoteric effect, *Cone of Paralysis* 5th level effect, *Conjure Supreme Elemental* 5th level effect, *Telekinesis* 5th level effect, *Flight* 3rd level effect, *Invisibility* 3rd level effect, *Perpetual Illumination* 3rd level esoteric effect, *Fireball* 3rd level effect, *Thunderbolt* 3rd level effect, *Cone of Frost* 3rd level effect, *Webbing* 2nd level effect, or 1st level effect = effective 13.875th level esoteric effect 208,125gp). Apparent Value: 8,000gp.

###### Staff of the Healer

This staff is made of rosewood, its head carved and gilded to appear as the sacred torch of Mityara. The staff brings a small mercy repeated a thousand-fold, rather than expending charges like a typical staff. Once per turn it may be touched by a divine spellcaster to a creature and activated by command word to heal 1d6 damage, as the spell *cure light injury*. Base Cost: 16,500gp (1/turn *Cure Light Injury* 1st level effect). Apparent Value: 1,500gp.

###### Staff of the Mage

This **staff +1** is among the finest arcane implements ever created, made of ebony inlaid with gold and lapis lazuli spiraling in multiple directions at once. The staff provides an arcane spellcaster with immense and versatile powers. Upon activation the staff expends a charge and creates the wielder’s choice of a devastating *cone of frost, fireball,* or *thunderbolt*, as the spells of the same names. Each blast deals 8d6 extraordinary damage of the appropriate elemental damage type to all in the affected area, with a successful Blast saving throw preventing half the damage and any other spell effects. Alternatively, a charge may be expended to move objects of up to 72 stone for up to 12 turns as the spell *telekinesis*, or to create a sustained magical light as the spell *perpetual illumination* (the duration elapsing if the staff is destroyed or depleted of charges). Lastly, the staff’s charges may be expended to impart force to a blow, as a **staff of smiting**. Base Cost: 126,875gp(Staff +1 5,000gp, 30 charges choice of *Telekinesis* 5th level effect, *Perpetual Illumination* 3rd level effect, *Fireball* 3rd level effect, *Thunderbolt* 3rd level effect, *Cone of Frost* 3rd level effect, or 1st level effect = effective 8.125th level effect 121,875gp). Apparent Value: 3,000gp.

###### Staff of Smiting

This **staff +1** is a stout piece of solid mahogany, hardened by bands of iron bound around its head. When attacking with the staff any spellcaster may expend a charge; should his subsequent attack roll be successful the attack will deal an additional 1d6 extraordinary bludgeoning damage. The staff still functions as a **staff +1** after its charges have been exhausted. Base Cost: 20,000gp (Staff +1 5,000gp, 30 charges 1st level effect 15,000gp). Apparent Value: 400gp.

###### Staff of Wilting

This **staff +1** is made of black oak, its top carved to resemble a shriveled and shrunken human head with inky sapphires set as eyes. This weapon was made not merely to fight but to wound and torture. A divine spellcaster can expend one to three charges when attacking with the staff. If he expends one and his subsequent attack roll is successful, the attack will deal an additional 1d6 extraordinary bludgeoning damage, as a **staff of smiting**. If the wielder expends two charges, the victim is additionally aged 10 years unless he succeeds on a Death saving throw; creatures with a short lifespan might instantly die upon aging. If a full three charges are expended, a victim who fails his Death saving throw will also lose one of his limbs, the appendage shriveling to a husk as the tissue withers beneath mummified skin. Roll 1d4: 1 – right arm, 2 – left arm, 3 – right leg, 4 – left leg. Once depleted of charges, the staff still functions as a **staff +1**. Base Cost: 53,750gp (Staff +1 5,000gp, 30 charges choice of 1st level effect, 4th/2= 2nd level effect, or 6th/3= 2nd level effect = 3.25th level effect, 48,750gp). Apparent Value: 4,000gp.

###### Wand of Fear

This bent wand of yellow holly is carved to resemble a cracked arrow, its false fletching painted white. Upon activation the wand expends a charge and produces a *cone of fear* as the spell, 60’ long and 30’ wide at its end. Each living creature within the affected area is **frightened** for 10 rounds unless it succeeds on a Paralysis saving throw. While **frightened** they cannot attack, cast spells, or speak coherently except to babble and scream in fear; they will flee from the wand’s wielder at full speed, cowering if unable to flee, until the duration ends. Base Cost: 40,000gp (20 charges *Cone of Fear* 4th level effect). Apparent Value: 40gp. Wand of Figments

This smooth wand is made from a long growth of spiked cactus encased in a layer of hard clear resin. Upon activation the wand expends a charge and produces a *phantasmal figment* as the spell, allowing the user to make a visual illusion appear within the bounds of a 20’ per side cube up to 360’ away. The user can freely move the illusion within the bounds of the cube; it persists for as long as he maintains concentration and for one round thereafter. Base Cost: 20,000gp (20 charges *Phantasmal Figment* 2nd level effect). Apparent Value: 120gp.

###### Wand of Fireballs

This wand crafted from royal poinciana has the wood along its length carefully scorched to appear as a succession of expanding spheres. Upon activation the wand expends a charge and produces a *fireball* as the spell, 20’ in diameter at a specified point within 360’. All caught within the blast suffer 6d6 extraordinary fire damage, with a successful Blast saving throw preventing half the damage. Base Cost: 30,000gp (20 charges *Fireball* 3rd level effect). Apparent Value: 24gp.

###### Wand of Foe Discernment

This wand is cut from a clean rowan branch with an indentation just above the hand painted in bright blue. Upon activation the wand expends a charge and allows the user to perceive every evil creature, object, or area in his line of sight out to 45’, as the spell *discern evil*. The evil entities appear to be engulfed in an unsettling red glow, which can be seen even if they are hidden or invisible. Only the user can see this glow, the effect lasting for 3 turns. Base Cost: 10,000gp (20 charges *Discern Evil* 1st level effect). Apparent Value: 70gp.

###### Wand of Frost

This wand of white pine is bound with a silver band at each end and a piece of polished white quartz at its tip. Upon activation the wand expends a charge and produces a *cone of frost* as the spell, 60’ long and 30’ wide at its end. All within the cone suffer 6d4 magic extraordinary cold damage, with a successful Blast saving throw preventing half the damage. Any mundane fires within the cone are automatically extinguished. Base Cost: 30,000gp (20 charges *Cone of Frost* 3rd level effect). Apparent Value: 120gp.

###### Wand of Impetus

This ash wand is marked at its base with a carved catapult, a tiny sapphire set as the projectile. Upon activation the wand expends a charge and flings one or more objects or creatures within 480’ a distance of up to 20’, as the spell*force of impetus***.** The wielder can target up to six creatures or objects of 12 stone (120 lbs) or less, or a single creature or object weighing up to 64 stone (640 lbs). Base Cost: 30,000gp (20 charges *Force of Impetus* 3rd level effect). Apparent Value: 400gp.

###### Wand of Item Negation

This wand of clean-cut ivory is inscribed with a precisely broken circle at the midpoint. Upon activation the wand expends a charge and renders a targeted charged or activated magic item within 180’ unable to be activated or triggered for 1 turn. This negation effect does not dispel any active spell effects already produced by the item, and permanent item effects are likewise unaffected; for example, a **staff of the mage** would still act as a **staff +1**, and the fabled **sword of fortune** would remain a **sword +1** that grants a bonus to saving throws. Negated items do not consume charges from activation attempts, though nothing useful remains of drunk potions, scattered **dust of revelation**, or similar. Base Cost: 60,000gp (20 charges 6th level effect). Apparent Value: 600gp.

###### Wand of Magic Discernment

This short, straight hawthorn wand is marked with a number of small holes representing stars, and a larger carving of a crescent moon. Upon activation the wand expends a charge and allows the user to *discern magic* as the spell. Areas, creatures, and objects within 90’ which are in his line of sight and imbued with or affected by one or more magical effects are visible to him in a pale glow, as if the moon shines on them alone. **Bewitchments** and **curses** cannot be discerned, and **invisibility** effects conceal both themselves and any other magic affecting their subject. Base Cost: 10,000gp (20 charges *Discern Magic* 1st level effect). Apparent Value: 70gp.

###### Wand of Metal Location

This wand is made of blue-stained oak with a lodestone embedded in its tip. Upon activation the wand expends a charge and will be pulled in its wielder’s hand to point in the direction of any concentration of metal weighing 10 or more stone within 90’. If multiple such concentrations of metal are in range, he will feel multiple forces attempting to twist the wand, only able to determine one direction per round. He can identify the type of metal detected, or the most common metal if multiple types are found in one deposit. Lead will be located but cannot be identified; the wand cannot distinguish between lead shielding other metals and a mass of solid lead. The wand remains useful for six turns per charge. Base Cost: 30,000gp (20 charges 3rd level effect). Apparent Value: 150gp.

###### Wand of Mage Missiles

This oak wand has a bronze cap at each end. Upon activation the wand expends a charge and produces a series of magic projectiles, one each round, as the spell *mage missile*. The missiles continue as long as the user maintains concentration. If concentration is broken, another charge must be expended to resume the stream of *mage missiles*. Base Cost: 10,000gp (20 charges *Mage Missile* 1st level effect). Apparent Value: 30gp.

###### Wand of Paralysis

This thin wand is made of gnarled oak, the knots in the wood resembling the joints of elderly arthritic fingers. Upon activation the wand expends a charge and produces a *cone of paralysis* as the spell, 60’ long and 30’ wide at its end. Each creature within the affected area is **paralyzed** for 6 turns unless it succeeds on a Paralysis saving throw, tendons tightening into place and joints grinding to a halt. Base Cost: 50,000gp (20 charges *Cone of Paralysis* 5th level effect). Apparent Value: 20gp.

###### Wand of Thunderbolts

This mahogany wand has wavering grooves running down its entire length. Upon activation the wand expends a charge and produces a *thunderbolt* as the spell, 5’ wide and 120’ long. All within the bolt’s path suffer 6d6 extraordinary electric damage and are deafened, with a successful Blast saving throw preventing the deafness and half the damage. As with the spell, a bolt from the wand may deflect off barriers that it is too weak to shatter. Base Cost: 30,000gp (20 charges *Thunderbolt* 3rd level effect). Apparent Value: 25gp.

###### Wand of Transformation

Made of oak, rowan, and maple, the woods of this wand blend as if saplings were spliced and made to grow together. The wand may be used with a touch to transform a living creature of up to man-size. If transforming the user it functions as the spell *transform self*: He takes the form of a creature of his choice of up to 12 HD or twice his own HD (whichever is lower). The transformation lasts for 3 hours, with the user able to end the effect at will. If used on another creature it functions as the spell *transform other*: The target is forced to take the form of a living creature chosen by the user of not more than twice his HD or 12 HD (whichever is lower). An unwilling target resists the effect on a successful Spells saving throw, and unless the target is helpless the user must also make a successful attack throw to touch him with the wand. A victim transformed in this way retains the form perpetually until he dies, the effect is **dispelled**, or the wand is destroyed or depleted of charges. In either use, the transformed creature gains all its physical and special attacks and characteristics of its new form, but retains its own mind and hit points. The wand cannot change its target into a duplicate of a specific individual, nor into a creature with more than one special ability (\*), an incorporeal or gaseous creature, or a construct, elemental, or undead. Any form created by the wand is sterile. Base Cost: 90,000gp (20 charges choice of *Transform Self* 6th level or *Transform Other* 6th level = 9th level effect). Apparent Value: 700gp.

#### Miscellaneous Magic Items

Whether permanent, periodically usable, or charged, magic effects can be worked into almost any physical object. Miscellaneous items can be used by any character unless indicated otherwise.

The caster level for a miscellaneous item’s effect is equal to the lowest caster level needed to cast that level of spell. Anytime a spell cast from a miscellaneous magic item triggers a Spells saving throw, the target makes an Implements saving throw instead. Paralysis, Death, or Blast saving throws are not replaced by Implements saving throws, however.

###### Amulet of Indiscernibility

This glass pendant hangs from an electrum chain, a golden sphere at its core barely visible through swirls of black and gray. The pendant blocks *scrying* or *locating* the wearer or items on his person, and he can automatically refuse an attempt to establish a telepathic link, as the spell *indiscernibility*. Anyone attempting to *scry* or telepathically contact the wearer will know only that he is protected from the effect, with no further details about how or why; if the wearer himself can cast *scry,* he has the normal chance to notice scrying attempts against him. Base Cost: 30,000gp (Permanent (1/day) *Indiscernibility* 4th level esoteric effect). Apparent Value: 2,000gp.

###### Bag of Oblivion

Resembling a **bottomless bag**, this bag can be distinguished by its bronze threads shining brighter than the gold threads of its counterpart. Like the **bottomless bag**, this bag can hold items totaling up to 100 stone within its 10’ x 5’ x 3’ volume. Its contents are not safely stored, however; each item disappears after being in the bag for 1d12 turns as soon as the bag is closed. Items which vanish in this manner are typically lost forever, though at the Judge’s discretion creatures lost within may find themselves on distant worlds, legendary artifacts may be freshly interred deep in ancient dungeons, and so forth. Base Cost: 72,000gp (Permanent (1/hour) 6th level esoteric effect). Apparent Value: 15gp.

###### Basin of Conjuring Water Elementals

This basin is made of deep blue glass cut with a pattern of whorls and waves. Once per day when the basin is filled to its brim with clean water, the user may speak an invocation to conjure a **12 HD elemental** from the Elemental Sphere of Water (see the ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual*** for details), as the spell *conjure major elemental*. The elemental will obey its master’s will so long as he maintains concentration, for up to 13 turns. He can dismiss the elemental at will to return it to its native sphere, but will lose control if his concentration is lost or the elemental moves more than 360’ away from him. An uncontrolled elemental will attack him and his allies before returning to its native sphere; it may not be banished by further use of the basin, only by spells such as *counterspell, dispel magic,* or *dispel evil.* Base Cost: 20,000gp (1/day *Conjure Major Elemental* 4th level effect). Apparent Value: 300gp.

###### Belt of Dwarvenkind

Created to honor Prefect Franco Scaramuccius for his vital aid during the Beastmen Wars, this splendid belt is layered with golden links, its large buckle a solid platinum depiction of a particularly proud and imperious dwarven face. In their gratitude the Meniri dwarves fashioned the belt to bestow upon its wearer the greatest of all boons: making him like a dwarf. The wearer gains all racial traits of a dwarf: their **hardy nature**, **sensitivity to rock and stone**, and ability to speak and read the **dwarf tongues**. The wearer’s beard grows twice as fast, and his mannerisms become more dwarflike; this grants him a +1 bonus to the reactions, loyalty, and morale of dwarves, but a -1 penalty to the reactions, loyalty, and morale of humans and other demi-humans (gnomes and halflings excepted), who perceive him as exhibiting the worst of dwarven foibles. Whether the Prefect wore this belt after its presentation is a detail sadly missing from the historical record. Base Cost: 76,000gp. Permanent (1/3 turns) 4th level effect. Apparent Value: 4,000gp.

###### Belt of Giant Strength

A mountain’s peak is embossed on the buckle of this tall leather belt. The belt can be worn by a small or man-sized creature, but not by anything larger. The wearer is imbued with the strength of a giant; he gains +2 to melee attack throws and deals an additional die of damage with every physical attack. If his attack already deals a set of damage dice, it deals an additional set of damage dice with every physical attack (e.g. 4d6 instead of 2d6). He also gains a +8 bonus to Dungeonbashing proficiency throws and doubles his normal carrying capacity. The effects of this belt, as with the spell *giant strength*, do not stack with any other effects that influence strength or size, only with the natural prowess (or lack thereof) of the wearer; a strong wearer has the strength of a strong giant while a runt of a man gains the strength of a runt of a giant. Base Cost: 76,000gp (Permanent (1/3 turn) *Giant Strength* 4th level effect). Apparent Value: 1,200gp.

###### Boots of Bounding

These boots are made of supple goatskin with a springy slice of cork as an insole. The wearer can leap 10’ vertically and 30’ horizontally from a standing start. He also gains a +8 bonus on Acrobatics proficiency throws and needs no rest if engaged in ordinary movement, as the spell *leaping*. Base Cost: 19,000gp (Permanent (1/3 turn) *Leaping* 1st level effect). Apparent Value: 30gp.

###### Boots of Levitating

These lightweight high boots are adorned with small cloudy spinels up each side. The wearer may tap the boots together and point the toes up or down to move vertically up to 20’ per round while carrying up to his maximum load. This power requires concentration when used, but not to remain aloft. The wearer cannot float horizontally, but may push and pull his way along walls and ceilings at half his ordinary speed. While airborne the wearer makes attacks with an increasing penalty until he takes a round of concentration to stabilize himself, as the spell *levitation*. Base Cost: 47,500gp (Permanent (1/hour) *Levitation* 2nd level effect). Apparent Value: 150gp.

###### Boots of Striding

These low-cut horseleather boots are each dyed with a scarlet sunrise and a violet sunset. Once per day the wearer may activate the boots by stretching down and touching the toes with both hands to double his land speed for the next 12 hours. The effect will end early if **dispelled** or if the boots are removed. The wearer is left **fatigued** after the effect ends, suffering a cumulative -1 penalty on attack throws, proficiency throws, saving throws, and damage rolls until he rests as his dedicated activity for a day and gets 8 hours of restful sleep. Base Cost: 10,000gp (1/day 2nd level effect). Apparent Value: 35gp.

###### Boots of the Elven Ranger

These soft suede boots are cut low and dyed a mottled gray, and in ages past were crafted solely by the elves for the famed archers patrolling their homelands. The wearer of the boots gains a naturally delicate step, allowing him to move totally silently with a successful Sneaking proficiency throw of 12+. If he is already proficient in Sneaking, he instead gains a +8 bonus to his Sneaking proficiency throws, as the spell *silent step*. Base Cost: 19,000gp (Permanent (turn/level) *Silent Step* 1st level effect). Apparent Value: 20gp.

###### Boots of the Prizefighter

These flashy boots gleaming with rows of gold studs and sapphires set into their thick black leather were once owned by a succession of champion dwarven pugilists. Their wearer floats nimbly like a butterfly over the battlefield, receiving a +2 bonus to AC as well as a +2 bonus to saving throws where agility would help avoid the situation, such as tilting floors and pit traps. The wearer’s quickened steps aid him in a number of dirty fighting moves. With a successful proficiency throw in lieu of moving, he can swiftly slip around an opponent and attack from the rear, as though he had the Acrobatics proficiency. When using a Force Back or Knock Down special maneuver in combat, the wearer suffers only a -2 penalty to his attack throw rather than the normal -4, and his opponent suffers a -2 penalty to his saving throw against the maneuver if struck. If the wearer already has the corresponding Combat Trickery proficiency for the maneuver, he instead suffers only a -1 penalty to his attack throw, and his opponent suffers a -3 penalty to his saving throw. Base Cost: 76,000gp. 4 permanent (1/3 turns) 1st level effects 19,000gp each. Apparent Value: 3,000gp.

###### Bottomless Bag

This small sack has incredibly sturdy craftsmanship, each seam triply-stitched in bronze, silver, and gold colored threads. The bag’s room within is far beyond its apparent size without; it is able to hold objects up to 10’ x 5’ x 3’ in volume and up to 100 stone total weight. The bag’s weight increases normally as items are added until it reaches 6 stone, with further objects adding no further encumbrance. An otherwise-empty bag contains enough air inside for a single person to breathe for 72 turns, with multiple people inside dividing that time by the number present. Base Cost: 100,000gp (Permanent (1/turn) 4th level esoteric effect). Apparent Value: 45gp.

###### Bracers of Armor

Crafted of hardened leather or embellished metal, these thin arm guards grant a magical bonus equivalent to that of armor. Typically made for mages or priestesses, these bracers allow an unarmored character to gain bonus to AC as if wearing armor. Like actual armor, and unlike *arcane armor* or *divine armor*, the AC bonus from the bracer stacks with most other modifiers to AC. Base Cost: Bracers +1 5,000gp, Bracers +2 15,000gp, Bracers +3 35,000gp, Bracers +4 65,000gp, Bracers +5 105,000gp, Bracers +6 155,000gp, Bracers +7 215,000gp. Apparent Value: 150gp.

###### Brooch of Arcane Armor

This silver brooch for fastening a cloak is in the shape of a shield with heraldry detailed in gold wire. The brooch creates a weightless and invisible suit of armor around its wearer, guaranteeing him AC 7 against missile attacks and AC 5 against melee attacks, as the spell *arcane armor*. This protection stacks with modifiers to AC from DEX but not with modifiers to AC from armor, class powers, conditions, magic, or proficiencies. The brooch also renders its wearer **immune** to *mage missiles*, whether cast by a spellcaster or from a magic item. Base Cost: 19,000gp (Permanent (1/3 turns) 1st level effect). Apparent Value: 250gp.

###### Candle of Contemplation

These tapered, silver-flecked candles are typically found in bundles of 1d4 and emit a rich, earthy scent when lit. A spellcaster holding a lit candle for the full hour it burns can focus on its flickering flame and calming aroma to refresh his mind, regaining the ability to cast a spell of a level he had previously expended. A craftpriest might perform this contemplation while reciting prayers, a mage in silent thought, a shaman while dancing and chanting, and so on, as befits their magical tradition. A spellcaster may not in the same day regain the same level of spell through the use of candles or the Contemplation proficiency. Base Cost: 500gp (single charge 1st level effect). Single charge 1st level effect. Apparent Value: 10gp each.

###### Censer of Prophetic Dreams

This gold and silver incense burner is adorned with intricate religious iconography. To use the thurible, a divine spellcaster must light a stick of rare incense worth at least 20gp on his god’s holiest day of the week. The thurible will begin to produce a magical smoke with a heavenly aroma. If the person who lit the incense then goes to sleep within 10’ of the censer, he will awaken 2d4 hours later from a vivid *prophetic dream* sent by the gods, as the spell. The dream will convey a short piece of true, meaningful, and important information about a person, settlement, domain, realm, object, or event of interest to the user. However, the dream may be misunderstood due to cryptic symbolism and esoteric meaning; if the user misinterprets the dream or doesn’t act on the information, conditions may change so that the information ceases to be useful. If the thurible is used on the wrong day of the week, or by a person who is not a divine caster, it causes awful night terrors that deny the sleeper his night’s rest. Base Cost: 18,000gp (1/week *Prophetic Dream* 6th level esoteric effect). Apparent Value: 600gp.

###### Chalice of Blood

This infamous silver and bone goblet can grant a person the strength and knowledge of his slain foes. It is said that the first blood the chalice tasted was that of its own creator, the dark lord Theophanous, who tore out his own heart and drank its hot leakage from the cup to better embrace his newfound undeath without the weakness of heart-felt pity or compassion. To use the chalice, a person must first fill its cup with the blood of a sapient victim slain within the last round, and drink. The victim must make a Death saving throw as the chalice’s black magic works to bind his soul before it can depart. If the saving throw succeeds, the victim’s soul escapes; the drinker gains but a portion of the victim’s strength, receiving 1d10+3 temporary hit points which last for three hours. If the saving throw fails, the drinker consumes the victim’s soul; he instead receives 2d10+3 temporary hit points plus an additional 1 temporary hp per level of the victim, which last for an entire day. In addition, consuming the soul grants the drinker some important knowledge possessed by the victim, and prevents the victim being restored to life, as the spell *soul eating.* The chalice can be used once per turn, provided sufficient victims are available. If a person uses the chalice while already affected by its power, the temporary hp and memories from additional victims are cumulative with those already granted, to a maximum of 27 temporary hp. The drinker is treated as an inherently evil summoned creature for purposes of *discern evil* and *holy circle* while benefiting from the chalice’s magic; the knowledge and strength it grants can be stripped away by a successful *counterspell, dispel evil*or *dispel magic*. Base Cost: 132,000gp (1/turn *Soul Eating* 6th level effect 99,000gp, 1/turn *Necromantic Potence* 2nd level effect 33,000gp). Apparent Value: 500gp.

###### Chariot of the Gods

This chariot is a magnificent wheeled vehicle constructed from slates of dawn redwood and reinforced with bronze. The chariot is built with the same characteristics as an ordinary chariot (see the **Equipment Descriptions** in ***ACKS II Revised Rulebook***, Chapter 4), but with increased SHP and twice the speed, as shown in the Chariot of the Gods table. Unlike ordinary chariots, this mighty vehiclecan traverse thin air as if it were solid, level ground; when hitched to flying creatures capable of pulling it, it can soar through the heavens as easily as an ordinary chariot traverses the battlefield or race-course. Any time the chariot is in the air it glows brilliantly, as the spell *perpetual illumination*. The chariot, its driver, and its passengers benefit from *deflect ordinary missiles* as the spell, as well as *energy resistance*to cold, fire, and electric damage. The Judge should roll 1d6 to determine the chariot’s size: 1-2, light; 3-4, medium; 5-6 heavy. Base Cost: 263,500gp (permanent (turn/level) 4th level effect 76,000gp (air traversal), permanent (1/3 turns) 3rd level effect 57,000gp (deflection), 3 permanent (1/hour) 3rd level effects 36,000 each (energy resistance), permanent (1/day) *Perpetual Illumination* 2nd level esoteric effect 22,500gp). Apparent Value: 1,920gp.

###### Chime of Unlocking

This crystal bell is set on an ivory handle. When the bell is struck it expends a charge and suppresses any *magic lock* or *seal portal* spells within a 5’ radius of the location where the bell was struck. While suppressed, any doors and containers can be opened as if they were not magically sealed by either of the two spells; after 3 turns have passed the normal effects of the spells will return, with doors and lids springing closed if not barred from doing so. The chime has no effect on mundane locks, bars, and barricades; it is found with 2d4 charges remaining. Base Cost: 8,000gp (8 charges 2nd level effect). Apparent Value: 300gp.

###### Cloak of Protection

This cloak is made of brown wool with a silver clasp, shimmering slightly when worn as if seen through a haze. The wearer of the cloak receives a bonus to his AC and all saving throws, which stacks with worn armor and any other enhancements to AC and saving throws. Most of these cloaks provide a +1 bonus, but some crafted with greater power impart a +2 or +3 bonus. Cloak +1 Base Cost: 12,000gp (permanent (1/hour) 1st level effect), Cloak +2 Base Cost: 24,000 (permanent (1/hour) Shimmer 2nd level effect), Cloak +3 Base Cost: 48,000gp (permanent (1/hour) 4th level effect. Apparent Value: 170gp.

###### Cloak of Skinchanging

By raising the hood and wrapping himself in the folds of one of these animal-skin cloaks, the wearer can change into the form of a specific animal (determined by the type of cloak). While transformed, the wearer gains all of the physical characteristics, movement types, attack routines, and special abilities of his new form while retaining his own mental abilities. Once transformed, the wearer can remain in animal form indefinitely, but may return to his own form at any time. If slain while transformed, the wearer reverts to his original form. Once the wearer returns to his own form, the cloak’s powers may not be used again for one hour (six turns). Such cloakstraditionally come in one of six types, shown below. The Judge can choose or roll randomly for the type of cloak found, or make cloaks for other types of animals appropriate to his setting. Base Cost: 38,000gp (permanent (turn/level) 2nd level effect). Apparent Value: 1,200gp.

###### Cloak of the Elven Ranger

The means of its creation once a carefully guarded secret of the elves, this lightweight cloak seems to shift its hues between soft greens, browns and grays whenever its wearer moves. The wearer of the cloak blends almost effortlessly into his surroundings, and can hide in cover or darkness as a combat action with a Hiding proficiency throw of 12+. If he is already proficient in Hiding, he instead gains a +8 bonus to his Hiding proficiency throws, as the spell *chameleon*. Base Cost: 19,000gp (Permanent (turn/level) *Chameleon* 1st level effect). Apparent Value: 3,780gp.

###### Collapsible Boat

This lattice-patterned oak and walnut box is 12” x 6” x 6”, with a hinged lid covering one side. Opening the box reveals a number of intricately fitted copper levers and disks; manipulating these will cause the box to open further, wood shifting and unfolding over the course of a turn until a seaworthy vessel is formed. The box can become any standard vessel up to a value of 60,000gp (for the vessel list see **Equipment Descriptions** in ***ACKS II Rules Revision***, Chapter 4), from a canoe to a huge sailing ship. It will include oars, sails, and other mariner equipment needed for its operation, but no war machines or provisions. The ship will persist until its controls (moved to a place near its center) are manipulated to fold it back up, returning to its box shape in the space of a round and jettisoning anything or anyone left aboard. The ship cannot be dispelled but can be damaged as normal. Destruction of the vessel will also destroy the box; any lesser damage or loss of its equipment will show as damage to the box but can be repaired as normal while it is in ship form. The box can only be configured to a new type of vessel if its most recent ship shape is whole and undamaged. Base Cost: 150,000gp (Permanent (1/turn) 6th level esoteric effect). Apparent Value: 400gp.

###### Collar of Conversation

When this bejeweled leather collar is fastened around the throat of an animal, it grants the animal wearing it the ability to comprehend and converse in the language of any intelligent creature within 90’. For purposes of speech, an animal wearing the collar has an effective human-equivalent INT ability score equal to 6 +/- Trainability Modifier. For instance, a white ape (TM +3) wearing the collar has an effective INT 9, while a crocodile (TM -1) wearing it has an effective INT 5. If the collaris fastened around the throat of a sapient creature, it has no magical effect, but may inspire interesting conversations all the same. Base Cost: 100,000gp (permanent (1/turn) *Tongues* 4th level esoteric effect). Apparent Value: 1,000gp.

###### Crucible of Commanding Conjuring Fire Elementals

This orichalcum crucible’s base is set with electrum cut in the shape of flames. Once per day when the crucible is lit with coals, the user may speak an invocation to conjure a **12 HD elemental** from the Elemental Sphere of Fire (see the ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual*** for details), as the spell *conjure major elemental*. The elemental will obey its master’s will so long as he maintains concentration, for up to 13 turns. He can dismiss the elemental at will to return it to its native sphere, but will lose control if his concentration is lost or the elemental moves more than 360’ away from him. An uncontrolled elemental will attack him and his allies before returning to its native sphere; it may not be banished by further use of the crucible, only by spells such as *counterspell, dispel magic*, or *dispel evil*. Base Cost: 20,000gp (1/day *Conjure Major Elemental* 4th level effect). Apparent Value: 400gp.

###### Crystal Ball

This polished globe is the size of a man’s head, carefully cut from true crystal. It may be used thrice per day to *scry*, as the spell. The user must look into the ball while focusing on the image of a specific creature, object or place of his choice; for up to a turn he will see the target’s image regardless of distance for as long as he concentrates. Images seen this way will be clearer the more familiar and specific the target is. As with other scrying methods, use of a **crystal ball** has a chance of being detected by any creature capable of casting*scry*should he, an object he is carrying or wearing, or his present location be targeted. Base Cost: 24,000gp (3/day *Scry* 4th level esoteric effect). Apparent Value: 600gp.

###### Crystal Ball

The user must look into the ball while focusing on the image of a specific creature, object or place of his choice; for up to a turn he will see the target’s image regardless of distance for as long as he concentrates.

As with other scrying methods, use of a **crystal ball** has a chance of being detected by any creature capable of casting*scry*should he, an object he is carrying or wearing, or his present location be targeted. Base Cost: 24,000gp (3/day *Scry* 4th level esoteric effect). Apparent Value: 600gp.

###### Crystal Ball, Clairaudient

These **crystal balls** allow the user to hear from the location scried upon, as the spell*clairaudiency*. The user will hear through the ears of the creature closest to his apparent point of view. If a living creature is not within 90’ of the apparent point of view the *clairaudiency* will fail, though the ball will still show images of the scried target. Base Cost: 42,000gp (3/day *Scry* 4th level esoteric effect 24,000gp, 3/day *Clairaudiency* 3rd level effect 18,000gp). Apparent Value: 600gp.

###### Crystal Ball, Telepathic

These **crystal balls** allow the user mind-to-mind communication while scrying, as the spell *telepathy*. Each round while scrying the user may choose a sapient creature within 180’ of his apparent point of view to request a telepathic link. The target receives a Spells saving throw to resist the link if it is unwilling. Once linked, the caster can read all of the target’s surface thoughts and can send thoughts of his own to the target, without need for a shared language. If no sapient creatures are in range *telepathy* is impossible, though the ball will still show images of the scried target. Base Cost: 48,000gp (3/day *Scry* 4th level esoteric effect 24,000gp, 3/day *Telepathy* 4th level esoteric effect 24,000gp). Apparent Value: 600gp.

###### Cube of Cold Immunity

This pale marble cube appears to be a gambler’s die with a sleeping bear etched into one face. Pressing the bear wards away cold and frost from a cubic area 10’ per side, centered on the cube and moving with it. Those within the area are **immune** to cold as though benefiting from the spell *energy invulnerability*; they automatically succeed on saving throws versus spells or special abilities which deal cold damage, and ignore mundane and extraordinary cold damage. The cube’s effect lasts for 3 turns and may be activated once per hour. Base Cost: 40,000gp (1/hour 5th level effect). Apparent Value: 50gp.

###### Dead Man’s Hand

This grotesque creation is composed of the dried and pickled hand of a lawfully-executed murderer, upon which is mounted a candle formed from the fat of the same murderer. For any of the powers of the hand to be used, its candle must be lit. The candle’s flame gives off no apparent radiance and never seems to burn down, but like any flame can be extinguished by strong wind or water. While the candle is lit it gives an eerie light to its bearer only, letting him see in total darkness to a range of 60’ as the spell *lightless vision*. It also grants him two abilities each usable once each turn. First, by speaking the dead murderer’s true name, the bearer of the hand can *halt humanoids*for 3 rounds as the spell. Second, by speaking the name of the murderer’s last victim, the bearer can suppress *magic lock* and *seal portal* spells within 5’ for 3 turns, as a *chime of unlocking*. The hand can be used by any character but is most sought after by thieves, assassins, and nightblades. Base Cost: 88,500gp (Permanent (1/day) *Lightless Vision* 3rd level effect 22,500gp, 1/turn *Halt Humanoids* 2nd level effect 33,000gp, 1/turn 2nd level effect 33,000gp). Apparent Value: 5sp.

###### Drum of Terror

This large drum is made out of giant rattlesnake hide stretched over a 3’ wide oak frame and set with golden pins, weighing 1 stone. When the drum is struck it produces a bone-rattling beat in all living things within a 240’ radius, excepting the user and those within 10’ of him. Each creature within range must succeed on a Paralysis saving throw or be **frightened**, as the spell *cause fear*. The terror persists for as long as the user remains stationary and concentrates on beating the drum, causing those afflicted to flee if able or to cower if backed into a corner. If interrupted the drumbeat can be freely started again on a subsequent round; all those previously affected or newly exposed to the unnatural rhythm must then make a new Paralysis saving throw to resist the effect, but any who succeeded on a saving throw against it are immune to the effect for one turn afterwards. Base Cost: 150,000gp (Permanent (concentration) 6th level effect). Apparent Value: 750gp.

###### Dust of Revelation

This glittering golden powder is incredibly fine, typically secured in small packets of paper or fabric or in tubes of lightweight wood or bone. A container of dust hurled into the air will coat everything in a 10’ radius of the creature scattering the dust. The dust causes hidden creatures and objects to become instantly visible from the shimmering covering. Creatures coated cannot benefit from Hiding,Natural Stealth,*invisibility*, or the spell*illusory duplicates* until the dust’s magic fades in 1 turn or is dispelled; the dust is too fine to be removed by hand. The dust is typically found 3d10 containers at a time. Base Cost: 1,000gp (single charge 2nd level effect). Apparent Value: 0gp.

###### Dust of Vanishing

This fine charcoal-black powder seems to drink in light. It is typically secured in small packets of paper or fabric or in tubes of lightweight wood or bone. The dust can be applied to a creature or object to render the subject *invisible*. A creature coated will remain *invisible* even if it attacks, though if it casts a spell any dust on it will be rendered inert. The *invisibility* granted by the dust lasts for only 2d6 turns. The dust is typically found 3d10 containers at a time. Base Cost: 1,500gp (single charge 3rd level effect). Apparent Value: 0gp.

###### Elven Rope

These sturdy 50’ long magical ropes are finely braided, with great resistance to wear and damp. Upon command of a person touching it, the rope either ties itself at a point of the speaker’s choice with a spoken type of knot, or unties itself, doing so once per turn. Dwarves stridently insist that they were the original creators of these enchanted cords, calling them **dwarven cord**; when near the Meniri or Jutting Mountains it is best to just humor this claim. Base Cost: 3,300gp. 1/turn cantrip effect. Apparent Value: 90gp.

###### Emblem of the Eagle

This legendary insignia was first carried by the legion of Audarius Tarkaun when he defeated Baal the Terrible at the gates of Zidium, and for centuries afterward served as the insignia of the Auran Army. It was smuggled out of the capital by the Emperor’s Talons during the tumult of the Second Imperial Civil War, but no record of its final whereabouts exists. The emblem consists of a gold eagle mounted atop a 12’ tall pole. To use the emblem, a character must affix the flag of an organized military unit, division, or army to the emblem’s pole and bear it into battle. When borne into combat, the emblem deflects mundane missile and melee attacks targeted at its bearer or his allies within 30’, acting in all ways as the spell *banner of invincibility* except with thrice the spell’s radius and unable to be dispelled. Its increased radius prevents any deflected attack with an area of effect from having its center point of impact land nearer than 30’ from the emblem when it scatters.

If the emblem is carried as the flag of a company-sized or smaller unit on the battlefield, then the entire unit cannot be damaged by missile or melee attacks from units that cannot deal extraordinary damage, and is never considered threatened by enemy units that are unable to damage it. The effect ends if the unit ever recoils, flees, or routs. If the emblem is carried as the flag of an army leader’s unit, then so long as the unit carrying the emblem is fighting on the battlefield with its army, every unit in the army automatically stands firm on its first morale roll, or rallies if it would have stood firm. However, this benefit is lost for the duration of the battle if the unit carrying the emblem is destroyed, routed, or leaves the battle. Base Cost: 919,000gp (6 permanent (1/turn) *Banner of Invincibility* 6th level effects 150,000gp each, permanent (1/3 turns) 1st level effect 19,000gp). Apparent Value: 20,000gp.

###### Faerie Seed

These glistening almond-sized seeds are usually found in an soft leather bag. Planting a seed into the ground enchants all plants within a 240’ radius, as the spell *forest enchantment*. The enchanted plants shift so the planter and his allies can move among them freely, granting a +1 bonus to surprise rolls and faster movement as the spell. Meanwhile, the planter’s enemies will find those plants moving to hinder and vex them, suffering a -1 penalty to surprise rolls and slowing their movement as the spell. After each full season all normal plants in the area receive a collective saving throw to break the seed’s effect as if they were a 1 HD monster, unless the planter ends the effect early by severely damaging the plants or the effect is **dispelled**. Sapient or semi-sapient plant creatures in the area of effect must instead make a Spells save or become **bewitched**,as the spell *beguile humanoid*. 2d4 seeds are typically found in a bag at a time, remaining free of disease, rot, or spoilage indefinitely. Base Cost: 2,500gp (single charge *Forest Enchantment* 5th level effect). Apparent Value: 0gp.

###### Gauntlets of Ogre Strength

These thick gauntlets envelope each hand in a firm embrace of iron and leather. The wearer’s hands gain a staunch grip of their own, letting him strike, lift and carry as if he was an ogre of comparable build. He gains an additional +2 bonus to all melee attack throws and damage rolls and an additional +8 bonus on Dungeonbashing throws. He also gains the ability to strike barehanded for 1d4 bludgeoning damage and to carry an extra 10 stone at his maximum load. Base Cost: 38,000gp (Permanent (1/3 turn) *Ogre Strength* 2nd level effect). Apparent Value: 20gp.

###### Gem of Conjuring Earth Elementals

This round-cut emerald is a striking shade of green, with a darkened center containing miles of apparent depth. Once per day when the gem is surrounded with soil and squeezed, the user may speak an invocation to conjure a 12 HD elemental from the Elemental Sphere of Earth (see the ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual*** for details), as the spell *conjure major elemental*. The elemental will obey its master’s will so long as he maintains concentration, for up to 13 turns. He can dismiss the elemental at will to return it to its native sphere, but will lose control if his concentration is lost or the elemental moves more than 360’ away from him. An uncontrolled elemental will attack him and his allies before returning to its native sphere; it may not be banished by further use of the gem, only by spells such as *counterspell, dispel magic*, or *dispel evil*. Base Cost: 20,000gp (1/day *Conjure Major Elemental* 4th level effect). Apparent Value: 2,000gp.

###### Gem of Force

This brilliantly clear cubic diamond is a half-inch across with narrowly beveled edges. By touching a finger to each face of the diamond its owner will create a *wall of force* centered upon the gem, in the shape of a cube 10’ on each side with 1’ thick walls. Creatures and objects in the way of the cube of force are pushed gently to the nearest safe side of its walls; if activated while the user is surrounded by solid objects such as dungeon walls, the diamond glows momentarily but otherwise fails to function. The cube of force is impenetrable to all spells and objects and cannot be dispelled, only falling to a disintegrate spell or ritual magic. If activated while the user is flying, the cube of force will remain fixed in the air rather than fall. The cube of force remains for two turns once activated; its owner cannot end the effect early, and cannot activate the gem again until four further turns have passed. Base Cost: 48,000gp (1/hour *Wall of Force* 6th level effect). Apparent Value: 4,000gp.

###### Genie Bottle

Confined within this warm copper flask is an **efreet**, a mighty genie of elemental fire (see the ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual*** for details). The efreet is bound to serve whomever releases it by breaking the flask’s wax seal until a full month has passed, it is slain or **dispelled**, or it grants its master three *wishes*. The genie must obey its master’s verbal commands to the letter, but it will resentfully subvert its orders whenever possible, twisting meanings to bring its master harm. Compelling the efreet to grant *wishes* is a particularly perilous undertaking; with the genie directing immense realty-altering power, the slightest ambiguity will allow it to inflict ruinous troubles upon its master. Base Cost: 200,000gp (Single charge 9th level esoteric ritual effect). Apparent Value: 600gp

###### Hammer of the Master Smith

This iron dwarven smith’s hammer is covered with scratches and dents on all but the maker’s mark on the side of its head, and is imbued with long years of expertise. A wielder starting a project on which the hammer would be useful (producing a single weapon, set of armor, piece of jewelry, etc.) will work with enhanced ability, gaining a rank in the relevant Craft proficiency for the duration of the project, as the spell *crafting*. The increased skill lasts until the project is complete or a day has passed without the user working on the project for a full 8 hours. A project interrupted for more than a day cannot gain the benefits of the hammer again for that project. After beginning a project with the hammer, the user must wait one week before he can turn the hammer’s power to a new project, regardless of how long the first project takes to finish. Base Cost: 12,000gp (1/week *Crafting* 4th level effect). Apparent Value: 2gp.

###### Helm of Awe

This orichalcum helmet has an open face with long cheek guards and a tall red crest. The wearer of the **helm of awe** inspires dread in the hearts of the wicked. Each evil creature that begins its initiative or moves within 30’ of the wearer must make a Spells saving throw. If the save succeeds, the creature can act normally. If the save fails, the creature **falters** that round. A **faltering** creature suffers a -2 penalty to attack throws, proficiency throws, and saving throws against the wearer. For purposes of the helm’s power, evil creatures include hostile creatures of an alignment other than the wearer’s own, and inherently evil creatures such as undead and summoned creatures of Chaotic alignment. Base Cost: 76,000gp (permanent (1/3 turns) *Inspire Awe* 4th level effect). Apparent Value: 3,000gp.

###### Helm of Comprehension

This bronze helmet is embossed with a crisscross of golden lines, formed of characters from dozens of scripts overlaid on each other. The wearer can understand the general meaning of any written script he reads, even those inscribed in lost languages or encoded with ciphers or secret symbols, as the spell *discern gist*. Base Cost: 25,000gp (Permanent (1/turn) *Discern Gist* 1st level effect). Apparent Value: 150gp.

###### Helm of Disalignment

This elegant and lightweight open-faced helmet is lined with a soft velvet interior. The helm bears an unusual curse: a person putting on the helmet instantly has his alignment changed for as long as he wears it, with no saving throw permitted. A Lawful person becomes Chaotic and vice versa; one of neutral alignment has even chances of becoming Lawful or Chaotic. The effects of the helmet cannot be ended by a *remove curse* or *dispel magic* spell, only by the removal or destruction of the helmet; upon being separated from the helmet the wearer reverts to his original alignment. The helm’s *enslavement* of its wearer can be discovered by the spell *discern bewitchment*. Whoever wears the helmet will immediately know what it is, what it has done to him, and what would happen if it were to be taken off; however, he will not desire to remove it, viewing the result as a violation of his true self. The helmet will never accidentally slip off its wearer’s brow, requiring a successful Disarm or Sunder maneuver or a helpless wearer for it to be physically removed. Base Cost: 22,500gp (Permanent (1/day) 3rd level effect). Apparent Value: 660gp.

###### Helm of Telepathy

This ancient closed-face helmet is glossy black with fine platinum filigree, the lines of bright metal over the eyes and joints creating the impression of a scarab beetle resting over the wearer’s face. The helm grants the wearer the ability to communicate mentally at will, as the spell *telepathy*. With stationary concentration the wearer can establish a telepathic link with a sapient creature within 180’; the target is allowed a Spells saving throw to resist. If linked, the wearer can read all of the target’s surface thoughts and send thoughts of his own; deeper secrets or memories may require interrogation or other prompting to bring the thoughts to the present mind of the target. Base Cost: 100,000gp (Permanent (1/turn) *Telepathy* 4th level esoteric effect). Apparent Value: 2,500gp.

###### Helm of Teleportation

This silvered helmet shines with strange reflections showing an ever-changing medley of blurred locations. The helm allows its wearer to instantly send himself or a touched creature to his destination of choice once per turn, as the spell *teleportation*. An unwilling creature is allowed a Spells saving throw to resist the effect. Teleporting via the helm is just as inaccurate and dangerous for the teleported creature as with the spell, though the wearer may consider this a bonus when using it against a hostile target. Base Cost: 82,500gp (1/turn *Teleportation* 5th level effect). Apparent Value: 1,000gp.

###### Horn of the Eagles

When this rune-carved ivory hunting horn is steadily blown for a full turn, its high clear note calls 2d4 giant eagles (see the ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual*** for details) to the aid of the horn-blower. The eagles will fly from the nearest 24-mile wilderness hex of mountains terrain, requiring 1d6 hours if called from within such a hex, or an additional hour per additional 24-mile hex between that hex and the wielder’s location. If the wielder is unreachable upon the eagles’ arrival (such as deep in a dungeon), they will circle the sky nearby. The eagles will understand the horn-blower’s speech and will serve as his loyal friends and companions, acting as if they were the horn-blower’s henchmen. The eagles remain for one day before departing unless slain or **dispelled**. The horn can be blown once per day; if blown again when the eagles are about to depart, they will instead remain for another day. If the horn is ever blown by someone with malicious intentions for the eagles (such as to capture or kill them), it will instead emit only a wheezing gasp and no eagles will arrive. Base Cost: 25,000 (1/day 5th level effect). Apparent Value: 200gp.

###### Holy Talisman of the Winged Sun

This mythical relic was said to have been carried down from Mt. Audarammas by Azendor, prophet of Ammonar, when the Laws of Light first returned to mankind. It was lost to history when Baal the Terrible sacked Aura, and remains much sought by the Temple of the Winged Sun. Any character of Lawful alignment who bears the talismangains a +4 bonus to his Death, Implements, Paralysis, and Spells saving throws, as the spell *strength of mind*. If the bearer is also a divine spellcaster, he can use the talisman to cast *dispel evil*once per turn and to cast *restore life and limb*once per week. Base Cost: 174,000gp (1/turn *Dispel Evil* 6th level effect 99,000gp, permanent (1/hour) *Strength of Mind* 5th level effect 60,000gp, 1/week *Restore Life and Limb* 5th level effect 15,000gp). Apparent Value: 10,000gp.

###### Implement of the Night Sky

This strange 1’ wide disc of matte black metal is covered with an array of sparkling dials and switches. Just as the stars move across the heavens, the implement’s powers change with every month of the year. Each month the implement offers its user a different set of three powers, each of which can be used once per day with a spoken command. In order for the implement to function, its dials and switches must be rotated to correctly match the configuration of the constellation currently within the zodiac, which requires one turn and a successful Knowledge (astrology) proficiency throw. (If the Judge wishes to substitute zodiac signs of his own design in lieu of those listed below, each zodiac sign should have three powers, totaling 12 levels of spells. E.g. one 6th, one 4th, and one 2nd level power, or two 5th and one 2nd, etc.) Base Cost: 60,000gp (1/day combined 12 levels of effect). Apparent Value: 1,100gp.

This platinum flask is set with tiny blue diamonds forming a depiction of a bursting spring. The flask is full of an endless amount of clean water; when it is opened and held perfectly upside down the water flows out at five gallons per round. This water exists permanently and cannot be dispelled, similar to the spell *create water*. Up to once per turn the flask can be commanded to expel a spout of water 60’ long and 5’ wide. Those struck by the blast suffer 2d6 extraordinary bludgeoning damage and are knocked **prone**; a successful Blast saving throw prevents the knockdown and halves the damage taken. Base Cost: 141,500gp (Permanent (1/turn) 5th level esoteric effect 125,000gp, 1/turn 1st level effect 16,500gp). Apparent Value: 5,000gp.

###### Iron-bound Book of Xisuthros

Written by the Chthonic priest Xisuthros a thousand years before the Auran Empire dawned, this heavy tome contains innumerable incantations and workings of complex spellcraft, with a focus on black magic and diabolism. The book was Xisuthros’s life’s work, with its final pages cut from his own flesh and inked with his own blood. His masterpiece consumed not merely his body but also his mind, a vestige of his soul bound within to serve as a conduit for the book’s magic. The book may be read to gain access to otherworldly knowledge from entities of Chthonic Darkness, answering up to 4 questions with each turn of use as the spell *contact other sphere*. As with the spell, the user must make a Death saving throw after each answer; however, in lieu of gaining a Tampering with Mortality side effect on a failure, Xisuthros’s remnant will gain a foothold in the user’s mind. Once the vestige has seized hold, the user must make a saving throw each day versus Spells or fall under its control. The user’s first saving throw against the vestige gains a +20 bonus, but each consecutive saving throw is one point less advantaged. When the user fails, he falls under the Judge’s control for 1d10 hours, during which time the vestige will seek to advance its own depraved chthonic ends and to restore Xisuthros to life. The day after falling under control, the user resumes his saving throws with a +20 bonus. Each additional time the user fails the Death saving throw while using the book, his initial saving throw bonus after falling under control is reduced by 4. The vestige’s malign presence can only be removed with ritual magic that would remove a tampering effect, such as a *wish* or *miracle*. Base Cost: 101,500gp (1/turn 5th level *Contact Other Sphere* esoteric effect 82,500gp, permanent (1/3 turns) 1st level effect 19,000gp). Apparent Value: 2,000gp.

###### Iron Crown of the Sorcerer-Kings

This infamous regalia was created by Uragasi, first sorcerer-king of Zahar, conqueror of the Thrassians. It was worn by every reigning sorcerer-king thereafter until it was lost to history during the fall of Zahar. While the crownis worn, the wearer regenerates 3 hit points each round. If the wearer is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, he immediately rolls 1d20 and 1d6 on the Mortal Wounds table, applying the usual modifier for Hit Points and Constitution, but applying a +11 bonus in lieu of the usual modifiers for Treatment and Timing. After the mortal wound (if any) is determined, the wearer is then immediately restored to 1 hp without any need for bed rest. Any limbs or body parts lost to mortal wounds will attempt to crawl or squirm back to the main portion of the body to reattach, and can be reattached instantly simply by being held to the stump. If severed limbs or parts are forcibly kept from reattaching, the lost limbs and parts, along with all other mortal wounds received while wearing the crown, will be restored when the wearer regenerates to full hit points. The wearer of the crowncan only be actually killed if he is disintegrated, slain by death magic, or slain while helpless by an unengaged combatant. The crown will never accidentally slip from a Chaotic wearer’s brow, but it can be voluntarily removed, and it can be knocked from its wearer’s brow with a successful Disarm special maneuver. Base Cost: 222,000gp (permanent (1/turn) *Trollblood* 6th level effect 150,000gp, permanent (1/hour) *Necromantic Invulnerability* 6th level effect 72,000gp). Apparent Value: 6,500gp.

###### Iron Mask of Cyfaraun

At the height of their corruption in Southern Argollë, the elves of ancient Cyfaraun forged five grand masks on an altar of profane darkness for the leaders of the ascendant Chthonic cults. With the overthrow of the Argollëan Empire by its Thrassian slaves, the fate of the masks is unknown. Each of these intimidating headpieces consists of a fully-enclosing iron faceplate and skullcap helm forged in the likeness of a gargoyle, skull, demon, serpent, or snarling wolf. The mask is a heavy and unwieldy 2 stone of encumbrance when carried or held; once donned it fuses tightly to the wearer’s face and assumes a feather-weight lightness, removable only by the proper command word or by severing his neck. The mask shrouds its wearer in a powerful dweomer that renders him **immune** to all enchantment spells and effects. A person encased inside the mask maintains his normal senses and can see out to 60’ in total darkness, as the spell *lightless vision*. He may breathe unhindered, the mask filtering out any harmful vapors and gases or deleterious effects that rely on smell, such as a *cloud of poison* spell, a fetid gas or poison vapor breath weapon, natural miasma, or the stench of a troglodyte. The mask is imbued with dark Chthonic power, and its wearer can sense a constant thrum of unholy whispering in his mind, imposing a -2 penalty to Hearing throws and a -1 penalty to initiative and surprise rolls. The depraved ancient elven cult-magic emanates palpably from the mask when worn, giving the wearer a -4 penalty to all reaction rolls when dealing with Lawful beings and an immediate hostile reaction from Thrassians, lizardmen, troglodytes, and their ilk. Base Cost: 121,000gp (2 permanent (1/hr) 6th level effects 72,000gp each, permanent (1/day) *Lightless Vision* 3rd level effect 15,000gp, 2 permanent (1/3 turns) 1st level drawbacks -19,000gp each). Apparent Value: 4,000gp.

###### Magic Carpet

This rich carpet is 9’ square, artfully woven from vivid royal purple threads. A person sitting on the carpet and pulling at its tassels as reins will cause it to rise into the air, flying as the spell *magic carpet*. The carpet may hold the driver and up to three passengers for a total of 80 stone of weight; each passenger after the first slows its movement, from an encounter movement of 300’ per turn to 240’ and 180’ respectively. The pilot may not attack or cast spells while commanding the carpet but may do so when the carpet is brought to a hover. Passengers may act more freely, but both pilot and passengers risk being knocked from the carpet if they receive bludgeoning or seismic damage, as usual for the spell. Base Cost: 76,000gp (Permanent (turn/level) *Magic Carpet* 4th level effect). Apparent Value: 3,000gp.

###### Marvelous Dwarven Mechanism

This device is a metal rod 4’ long and 1.5” thick, one side ending in a hollow tube: a conglomeration of overlapping and interwoven plates, buttons, dials and knobs of gold, silver, steel, and bronze, somehow through marvelous craftsmanship appearing as a congruous whole. Though silent when not in use, tiny vibrations can be felt while holding it, as if mechanisms within are constantly rotating and ratcheting into place. Originally crafted by the dwarven smith Barin Bronzegear for the Highborn dwarf Nared Uoret to personally inspect his mines, the mechanism has since passed through the hands of a number of adventurers and explorers who found it equally useful for their own purposes. By careful working of its buttons, knobs, and dials, the implement can produce any of the following effects, though only one at a time:

* Be reconfigured into either a shovel, pick, saw, prybar, or sledgehammer, the tool head emerging from the solid end of the rod and the balance changing to suit.
* Produce a small flame from the tube end, emitting illumination and heat as a torch for 1 hour.
* Emit a great blast of air from the tube end, as the spell *gale of wind*.
* Chime when pointed at metal within 90’, as a wand of *locate metals* usable for 3 turns at a time.
* Release a spray of lubricating oil from the tube end, as the spell *slickness*.
* Be gently extended up to 10’ and locked into place, supporting up to 200 stone of weight when locked or firmly holding shut a door, gate, or window for 2d6 turns, as the spell *seal portal*.
* Unwind the entire center of the rod into 50’ of fine metal chain, functioning in most respects as sturdy rope. With the rod so configured, an identical set of buttons on each remaining end can direct it to move on its own power for up to 4 turns.
* Levitate itself and anything attached to it vertically 20’ per round for up to one turn, an increasingly urgent buzzing being felt in the rod toward the end of the duration.
* The rod can be changed between the various tool or chain configurations at will. After using either the flame, wind, metal detection, oil, extension lock, or chain animation ability, the user must wait one hour before using any of those abilities again. The levitation functions only once per day but is not constrained by use of the other abilities. Base Cost: 53,000gp (permanent (1/3 turns) 1st level effect (tools and chain) 19,000gp, 1/day 1st level effect (levitation) 5,000gp, 1/hour (choice of 2nd level effect (locate metals), *Gale of Wind* 2nd level effect, *Illumination* 1st level esoteric effect, *Seal Portal* 1st level esoteric effect, *Slickness* 1st level effect, 1st level effect (rope), total 3.625th level esoteric effect) 29,000gp.) Apparent Value: 1,500gp.

###### Mask of the Basilisk

This infamous mask of petrified wood is carved with a hideous reptilian visage, and held fast to its wearer’s head by an attached hood of basilisk hide. Any creature, friend or foe, who meets the wearer’s gaze must make a Paralysis saving throw. If the save succeeds the creature is unaffected, but if the save fails it is instantaneously **petrified**. Neither **dispelling** nor a *remove curse* spell can reverse the petrification; only the spell *depetrification* can return a petrified creature to living flesh. Creatures surprised by the wearer automatically meet his gaze, as do those attacking him without averting their eyes or using a mirror. An attacker that averts its eyes does not meet his gaze, but suffers a -4 penalty on attack throws and -2 penalty on AC. Anyone using a mirror to fight the wearer suffers a penalty of only -2 to attack throws and no penalty to AC. Base Cost: 150,000gp (permanent (1/turn) 6th level effect). Apparent Value: 350gp.

###### Mirror of Nemesis

This cursed mirror is made from a flat sheet of highly-polished bronze, typically kept covered by a scarlet cloth. The first living creature within 45’ of the mirror that makes eye contact with its reflection will see it appearing as a horrific double which seems to leap through the mirror’s surface and attack it. The reflection is visible only to the creature, immune to all attacks, and attacks each round with a 4 HD monster’s attack throw, as the spell *phantasmal horror*. The creature can make a Spells saving throw to disbelieve it at the start of its initiative, but if the creature fails, the reflection continues attacking until it slays its target by landing a single successful blow, is **dispelled**, or has been evaded for nine rounds. The mirror is subsequently left nonmagical. The Judge should roll d6 for the style of mirror (1-2, circular hand mirror 1’ diameter; 3-4, wall mirror 2’ x 3’; 5-6, standing mirror 3’ x 6’). Base Cost: 2,500gp (single charge *Phantasmal Horror* 5th level effect). Apparent Value: 100gp, but will likely trigger on appraisal.

###### Necklace of Acclimatization

Hanging from this gold-wire necklace is a platinum medallion, engraved with an image of a titan blowing away a cloud with a mighty breath. The necklace cleanses all air breathed by its wearer, protecting him from harmful or noxious vapors. He is **immune** to damage or negative effects caused by breathing in any sort of fumes, such as a *cloud of poison*spell, a fetid gas or poison vapor breath weapon, natural miasma, the rank scent of a troglodyte, and so on. Base Cost: 72,000gp (Permanent (1/hr) 6th level esoteric effect). Apparent Value: 600gp.

###### Panoply of the Imperial Warmistress

This legendary set of items was created for Zeodarë I, the first woman acclaimed Tarkaun, by the Temple of the Winged Sun in gratitude for her re-building the Golden Temple on Mt. Audarammas. The panoplywas lost centuries later during the widespread looting of the Second Imperial Civil War, and its whereabouts remain unknown. The panoply consists of a pair of bracers, a pair of boots, a corselet, and a diadem, described below.

**Bracers of the Imperial Warmistress:**These shining orichalcum bracers will repel mundane missile attacks from the wearer, other than those made with silver weapons, as the spell *deflect ordinary missiles***.** The wearer also gains a +2 bonus to AC and saving throws, as the spell *divine protection*. Both bracers must be worn for the magic to be effective. Base Cost: 106,750gp (permanent (1/3 turns) *Deflect Ordinary Missiles* 3rd level effect 57,000gp, permanent (1/hr) *Divine Protection* 3rd level effect 36,000gp, fractional set powers 13,750gp). Apparent Value: 3,000gp.

**Boots of the Imperial Warmistress:** The wearer of these strappy red leather boots moves with fluid grace and agility. She gains a +2 bonus to AC and initiative, as well as a +2 bonus to attack throws with medium or smaller melee and thrown weapons. She may spring up to 10’ high and to a distance of 30’, gains a +8 bonus on Acrobatics throws, and need not rest if engaged in ordinary movement, as the spell *leaping*. Both boots must be worn for the magic to be effective. Base Cost: 127,250gp (5 permanent (1/3 turns) 1st level effects 19,000gp each, permanent (1/3 turns) *Leaping* 1st level effect 19,000gp, fractional set powers 13,750gp). Apparent Value: 50gp.

**Corselet of the Imperial Warmistress:** This body-hugging corselet is crafted of thick crimson samite and ornamented with a gleaming orichalcum eagle. Its wearer gains a +5 bonus to AC, as though wearing **bracers of armor**. She is also **immune** to mundane cold damage and effects, and **resistant** to extraordinary cold damage and effects, as the spell *energy protection*. The corselet’s bonus to AC does not stack with armor, but does stack with other bonuses or penalties to AC (including from DEX, the use of a shield, class powers, other spells, a **ring of protection**, and so on). Base Cost: 142,750gp (+5 AC bonus 105,000gp, permanent (1/hr) *Energy Protection* 2nd level effect 24,000gp, fractional set powers 13,750gp). Apparent Value: 4,500gp.

**Diadem of the Imperial Warmistress:** This ornamental headband is forged of bright orichalcum and set with a ruby sun. Its wearer is granted a bold, commanding presence. She gains a +1 bonus to domain morale, to henchmen loyalty, to henchmen and troop morale while she leads them, and to reaction rolls to impress and intimidate. If she obtains a reaction roll of 12 or more, the subjects act as if **bewitched** while in her presence, as the Mystic Aura proficiency. The wearer is able to hire one more henchman than normally permitted. She is **immune** to normal and magical fear effects, and can apply her CHA modifier instead of her STR modifier to her damage rolls when attacking with tiny, small, or medium weapons. Base Cost: 113,750gp (4 permanent (1/3 turns) 1st level effects 19,000gp each, permanent (1/hr) *Allure* 1st level effect 12,000gp, permanent (1/hr) 1st level effect 12,000gp, fractional set powers 13,750gp). Apparent Value: 7,000gp.

A bladedancer, female warrior with 16 or higher CHA, or similar heir to Zeodarë I’s legacy who is equipped with at least two of the four components of the panoplygains the ability to cast *swift sword*once per day. If equipped with at least three of the four components, she also gains the ability to cast *striking*once per day. If equipped with the entire panoply, she additionally gains the ability to cast *winged flight*once per day.

Designer’s Note: The set power cost was calculated by dividing the base cost of each of the three daily effects by the corresponding number of items in the set required to access that power, then applying that cost to all items in the set.

###### Rope of Ascent

This 50’ length of rope is tightly spun, only a finger-width thick. Despite its size, it can support up to 100 stone of weight. A person holding one end of the rope may command it to move 10’ per round in any direction, with the rope able to tie and untie itself, wrap around things, or navigate around obvious hazards as commanded. The rope will ignore the orders of anyone who grabs it while it is already commanded. Base Cost: 19,000gp (Permanent (turn/level)1st level effect). Apparent Value: 100gp.

###### Scarab of Life

Hanging from a silver wire chain, this green agate amulet has its top carved as a scarab beetle, while its flat-faced bottom is minutely engraved with a short prayer for the safety of the wearer. The scarab protects its wearer from all **curse** and **death** spells and effects, including the enervation of certain demons and undead, as the spell *death ward*. It is a charged item and will eventually run out; each spell or effect blocked expends a charge from the scarab, which is found with 2d6 charges remaining. The agate crumbles into dust when its last charge is spent. Base Cost: 24,000gp (12 charges *Death Ward* 4th level effect). Apparent Value: 300gp.

This aurochs horn is encircled by ruddy gold bands depicting a succession of erupting volcanoes. Blowing the horn produces a blast of sound, forming a cone 100’ long and 20’ wide at its far end. Each creature caught in the blast suffers 3d6 extraordinary seismic damage and is deafened for 2d6 rounds; a successful Blast saving throw prevents the deafness and half the damage. Structures caught in a blast will suffer similar damage; a small wooden structure may be destroyed in one blast or a thick stone wall in several. The horn can be blown once per turn. Base Cost: 66,000gp (1/turn 4th level effect). Apparent Value: 700gp.

###### Thurible of Conjuring Air Elementals

This lightweight silver incense burner sways in the slightest of breezes as if the wind wishes to claim it. Once per day when the thurible is lit with sweet incense, the user may speak an invocation to conjure a **12 HD elemental** from the Elemental Sphere of Air (see the ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual*** for details), as the spell *conjure major elemental*. The elemental will obey its master’s will so long as he maintains concentration, for up to 13 turns. He can dismiss the elemental at will to return it to its native sphere, but will lose control if his concentration is lost or the elemental moves more than 360’ away from him. An uncontrolled elemental will attack him and his allies before returning to its native sphere; it may not be banished by further use of the thurible, only by spells such as *counterspell, dispel magic*, or *dispel evil*. Base Cost: 20,000gp (1/day *Conjure Major Elemental* 4th level effect). Apparent Value: 350gp.

###### Visor of the Eagle

This bronze face mask with the countenance of a fierce screaming eagle is meant for attachment to an open-faced helm as a visor. The wearer’s eyes look large and piercing from within, and are able to see with the clarity of a great bird of prey, eight times as far as he normally could. His enhanced sight reduces his penalty with missile attack throws to -1 at medium range and -2 at long range. Base Cost: 24,000gp (Permanent (1/hour) 2nd level effect). Apparent Value: 200gp.

###### Visor of the Vampire

This infamous silvered face mask with sinister frowning visage is meant for attaching to a helmet as an armored visor. Said to be wrought from the remains of ten-score vampires, with their coffins fueling its forge, it was worn by the Zaharan warlord Moruvai the Elder in his campaigns of utter subjugation. The wearer’s eyes appear like pools of endless promise; he can use a combat action to hypnotize a creature within 60’ which is beholding him, which must succeed on a Spells saving throw with a penalty of -2 or be **enslaved**. The **enslavement** lasts until **dispelled**, the wearer releases the creature, the wearer removes the mask, or the wearer is slain. Any creature that attacks or is attacked by the wearer in melee is assumed to meet his gaze unless it specifically averts its eyes. Combatants who avert their eyes suffer penalties of -4 on attack throws and -2 to AC. Up to 11 creatures can be **enslaved** at any given time. Base Cost: 150,000gp (Permanent (1/turn) 6th level effect). Apparent Value: 1,500gp.

Witch’s Broom

This broom can be distinguished from a mundane broom by its binding: golden hair from the head of a young maiden. When mounted and commanded the broom will rise into the air, able to fly at an encounter movement rate of 240’ per turn with a single rider weighing up to 20 stone. Should a second rider or equivalent weight be added, the broom will slow to a rate of 180’ per turn. The broom will not fly if more than 40 stone of weight is carried, plummeting to the ground or failing to rise as appropriate. Base Cost: 48,000gp (Permanent (1/hour) 4th level effect). Apparent Value: 2gp.

###### Woodwind of the Woodlands

This reed pipe is carved with pastoral images. If a person plays the woodwind while at least one animal of 1 HD or less is within 15’, the nearest such animal must make a Spells saving throw. If its save succeeds, the animal resists the woodwind’s magic; if it fails it falls under the pipe-player’s sway and thereafter does whatever he commands, the orders magically conveyed to the animal by the music of the pipe. The effect lasts for as long as the user continues to play, though the animal receives another saving throw each turn. Once freed the animal will immediately seek to return to its original location; its disposition towards the pipe-player will depend on how it was treated while ensorcelled. The woodwind cannot be used for one turn after the user stops playing or the animal succeeds on a saving throw. Using the woodwind does not require the Performance proficiency, but the target suffers a -1 penalty to the save per rank of Performance possessed by the pipe-player. Base Cost: 3,300gp (1/turn cantrip effect). Apparent Value: 105gp.

#### Arms and Armor

Magical weapons and armor follow the same class restrictions as all normal weapons and armor. When armor has a bonus, it improves the AC by the amount specified. Magical armor and shields are less cumbersome to move in and use than their nonmagical equivalents, and effectively weigh 1 less stone, to a minimum of 1/6 stone. This encumbrance reduction does not stack with the reduction from masterwork armor, nor does the amount vary with the armor or shield’s enhancement value.

EXAMPLE: A suit of **leather armor +2** grants AC (2+2) = 4 and has an encumbrance of (2-1) 1 st. A **shield +3** grants AC (1+3) = 4 and has an encumbrance of (1 – 1, minimum 1/6 st) 1/6 st.

When a weapon has a bonus, such as a **dagger +1**, this means that attack throws and damage rolls both receive the bonus. If a weapon has more than one bonus listed, the first bonus applies to all attacks and damage, and the second applies only to a more limited selection of creatures. If the weapon’s entry does not specify which group of creatures the secondary bonus applies to, you can choose or roll for the creatures affected on the Weapon vs. Creature table. All magic weapons deal extraordinary damage.

Special items for each category are described below for the categories of swords, miscellaneous weapons, and armors.

###### Types of Arms and Armor

In most cases, the entries for armor, swords, and weapons on the magic item tables do not specify the exact item found. A suit of armor might be hide, ring, or plate; a sword might be a short sword or a two-handed sword; a miscellaneous weapon might be a battle axe, spear, or warhammer. What is found will depend on the source of the treasure. The Judge can use the below tables to guide placement of appropriate armors, swords, and weapons in his treasure hoards based on the campaign setting and treasure source.

The categories used in these tables are described below. You should feel free to modify these tables or create your own that match your particular campaign settings. Many interesting possibilities presented by history have been excluded simply due to the limits of space.

**Ancient Myth:** For campaigns set in an ersatz Mesopotamian and Mediterranean Bronze or Iron Age civilization, such as Sumeria, Babylonia, Scythia, or Mycenae. Armor tends to be laminated cloth (leather), leather scale, Sumerian overlapping bronze plate (banded), or early bronze panoply (plate). Gladiator armors are included to represent partial armor sets of the next higher tier. Common weapons in these ancient days include the composite bow, javelin, mace, short sword, and spear. In the Auran Empire setting, treasures from the Ancient Argollëan, Thrassian, and Zaharan civilizations, and from contemporary Kemesh, would use these entries.

**Classical Epic:** For campaigns inspired by Greco-Roman, Zoroastrian Persian, or Byzantine civilization or sword-and-sandal fiction. Armor might be leather, leather scale, linothorox (laminated linen), Celtic mail or Roman lorica hamata (chain), Roman lorica squamata (scale), Roman lorica segmentata (banded), Byzantine or Persian lamellar, or Greek classical panoply (plate). Gladiator armors are included to represent both actual gladiator apparel and partial armor sets. Common weapons include composite bows; lances such as the kontos and xyston; pole arms such as the falx and sarissa; short swords such as the gladius, kopis, and xiphos; spears such as the doru; and swords such as the spatha. In the Auran Empire setting, these entries would apply to treasures from the Classical Auran civilization and the current Imperial one.

**Northern Saga:** For campaigns similar to the world described in the Old Norse and Icelandic epics and the Anglo-Saxon poem Beowulf, or historical Iron Age Germany or Viking Age Scandinavia. Armor will include furs, hardened leather, Frankish ring armor, leather scale, chainmail byrnies, and limited plate-and-mail. Common weapons include the battle axe, great axe, seax (dagger), spear, sword, and warhammer. In the Auran Empire setting, treasures from the Kingdoms of Jutland and Rorn would use these entries.

**Chivalric Romance:** For campaigns inspired by the 11th to 13th century *chansons de geste*, such as the Matter of France or Matter of Britain and the later chivalric romances of the 13th and 14th centuries. Armor might be cuir bouilli (leather), ring armor, leather scale, Norman mail hauberks, brigandine (lamellar), and plate-and-mail. Common weapons include the couched lance, great sword, horseman’s flail, longbow, knightly sword, mace, morning star, and various pole arms such as the halberd, glaive, and pike. This time period post-dates the Auran Empire setting, but is very common in other fantasy game settings.

**Arabian Adventure:** For campaigns drawing on the late Byzantine and Persian Empires, the medieval Crusades, the Islamic Golden Age, and the folk lore of *One Thousand and One Nights*. Armor might be silk, leather, ring, leather scale, Crusader mail, eastern lamellar, or mirror armor (plate). Common weapons include the composite bow, lance, mace, spear, and various curved swords such as the scimitar, shamshir, and tulwar. In the Auran Empire, these entries could be used for contemporary Opelenean, Somirean, Skysos, and Celdorean treasures.

**High Fantasy:** For campaigns inspired by Tolkienesque heroic fantasy in the pseudo-medieval tradition, including *The Lord of the Rings*, *Dragonlance*, *Game of Thrones*, *The Deed of Paksenarrion*, and most other popular fantasy of the last few decades. The armor and weapons tend to be similar to those used in the High Middle Ages.

**Sword & Sorcery:** For campaigns inspired by Howardian heroic fantasy in the pulp tradition, including *Conan*, *Kull*, *Thongor*, *Kothar*, and other works. The armor and weapons tend to be a hodgepodge of the ancient, classical, medieval, exotic, and purely fantastical.

The apparent value of any magic sword is 650gp plus the base cost of the weapon (657gp for a short sword, 660gp for a sword, etc.) unless detailed otherwise, equivalent to the value of a masterwork weapon. Daggers, short swords, and two-handed swords are all considered swords for purposes of determining magic items present under the Classic Magic Item Tables.

#### Swords

###### Dagger +1, Delver’s

Known for its use by dwarven explorers and relic-hunters, aboveground this thin dark blade acts as a **dagger +1**. When underground (in a cave, crypt, cellar, or so on) its true power is revealed: it functions as a **dagger +2** and grants its wielder heightened vigilance and stealth while held. The wielder receives a +1 bonus to surprise rolls, and imposes a -1 penalty to opponents’ surprise rolls when approaching from outside line of sight or lying in wait in cover, dim light, or darkness. The dagger also can help uncover relics and riches; once per week, if a coin is touched to the blade, its tip jerks to point in the direction of the most valuable treasure within 240’, as the spell *locate treasure* but with a duration of just one round. Anyone who wields the dagger underground attunes to the dark, suffering a -1 penalty to all attack throws while in direct sunlight for one week afterwards. Base Cost: 26,000gp. (Dagger +1/+2 10,000gp, permanent (1/3 turns) 1st level effect 19,000gp, 1/week 1st level effect 3,000gp, 1/week 2nd level effect drawback -6,000gp). Apparent Value: 653gp.

###### Fire-Eater Sword

This **sword +3** was forged in frost, cold-hammered into form from star-iron that fell out of the icy sky onto a frozen plain. Heat sinks into the blade, never to return. Against creatures that employ elemental fire attacks or live in environments of elemental fire (red dragons, efreeti, fire giants, etc.) it functions as a **sword +6**, cleaving through their flesh and bone like an iceberg carving valleys into the earth. Merely concentrating for a round to point the **fire-eater** steady at flames within 15’ will snuff them out as the spell *quench flame*, extinguishing an area up to 5’ in diameter each round. Its wielder is **immune** to mundane fire damage and automatically succeeds on associated saving throws; he is also **resistant** to extraordinary fire damage, reducing damage by half and receiving a +2 bonus on associated saving throws. Base Cost: 144,000gp (Sword +3/+6 95,000gp, Permanent (1/hour) *Energy Protection* 24,000gp, permanent (concentration) 1st level effect 25,000gp). Apparent Value: 2,000gp.

###### Red Sword of the Warlord

Few weapons are so legendary as the **red sword of the warlord**. The beastman warlord Thrax wielded this orichalcum **sword +3** until his death at the Battle of Bythnium, and the Tarkaun Audarius XI Ulkyreus later bore it throughout his 42-year reign of conquest and war. Like many other imperial relics, it was lost to history during the Second Imperial Civil War. Its wielderis a veritable god of war on the battlefield. He may make an extra attack every round, as the spell *swift sword*, and every successful hit he makes deals an extra 1d6 points of extraordinary luminous damage. He is granted a limitless number of cleaves each round, allowing him to singlehandedly carve through entire formations of enemies. The blade of the swordglimmers scarlet if brandished while enemies are within 60’, giving off light like a torch. Base Cost: 237,000gp (Sword +3 35,000gp, permanent (1/3 turns) 4th level effect 76,000gp, permanent (1/3 turns) *Striking* 3rd level effect 57,000gp, permanent (1/3 turns) *Sustained Swift Sword* 3rd level effect 57,000gp, permanent (1/hour) *Illumination* 1st level esoteric effect 12,000gp). Apparent Value: 3,000gp.

###### Sword +1, Bright

This elegant **sword +1** has a blade polished to a mirror finish visible in the slightest glimmer of light. When flourished while speaking its command word the sword will emit light as the spell*illumination*. The*illumination* is deactivated in the same manner and can be activated or deactivated at will. Base Cost: 17,000gp (Sword +1 5,000gp, permanent (1/hour) *Illumination* 1st level esoteric effect 12,000gp). Apparent Value: 660gp.

###### Sword +1, Deathless

This **sword +1** has a backwards-curved meteorite-iron blade set on a bone hilt. The hilt is carved into the shape of a screaming skull and always feels cold to the touch. Such swords were created by the southern Argollëan elves in the final days of their Empire, as a testament to their mastery of necromantic art. Three times per day when the sword is used to slay a living creature, its wielder can, in lieu of cleaving, raise that creature as a *deathless minion* (as the spell). Base Cost: 17,000gp (Sword +1 5,000gp, 3/day *Deathless Minion* 2nd level effect 12,000gp). Apparent Value: 660gp.

###### Sword +1, Flamebrand

The blade of this **sword +1, +2 vs oozes, +3 vs regenerating creatures** glows as if fresh from the forge, softly illuminating a 5’ area with a ruddy light. The sword was imbued with elemental fire to strike down monstrosities unfazed by the bite of steel. All damage dealt with the sword, whether slashing or piercing, is also considered to be extraordinary fire damage, with any appropriate resistances or weaknesses applying. On command the sword’s smoldering glow will flare up brightly, flames rippling over the blade to provide the equivalent of torchlight. Base Cost: 42,000gp (Sword +1/+2 (two types)/+3 22,500gp, permanent (1/day) 1st level esoteric effect 7,500gp, permanent (1/hour) *Illumination* 1st level esoteric effect 12,000gp). Apparent Value: 1,200gp.

###### Sword +1, Locating

This **sword +1** has a silver hound’s head for a pommel. Once per day the sword can be used to sense the direction and approximate distance to a chosen object within 180’, as the spell *locate object*. With the sword held in a loose grip and its command word spoken, it turns to point at the object and emits a gentle hum that increases the closer it draws to the object. The sword will continue to indicate distance and direction to the chosen object for an hour, sensing it through any amount of earth, stone, or wood but unable to perceive through gold or lead. Base Cost: 15,000gp (sword +1 5,000gp, 1/day *Locate Object* 2nd level effect 10,000gp). Apparent Value: 660gp.

###### Sword +2, Beguilement

The pommel of this **sword +2** is made of carved jet depicting a coiled serpent with a woman’s face, set with small golden sapphires for eyes. Thrice per week while stroking the pommel, the bearer may speak the sword’s command word as part of conversation with a living humanoid target within 90’. If the target has fewer than 5HD they will become **bewitched** unless they resist the effect with a successful Spell saving throw, as the spell *beguile humanoid*. Those being threatened or attacked by the wielder or his allies receive a +5 bonus to this throw. Base Cost: 19,000gp (Sword +2 15,000gp, 3/week *Beguile Humanoid* 1st level effect 4,000gp). Apparent Value: 800gp.

###### Sword +2, Command

This sickle-shaped **shortsword +2** has a meteorite-iron blade set on a hilt shaped like a golden crown. Such a sword forged in the early days of Argollë was famously carried as the sidearm of the great elven king Marcan during the Bitter War. Three times per day with the sword in hand and pointed at a target within 15’ the wielder can speak a *word of command* (as the spell), his voice gaining an impressive stentorian resonance while doing so. Base Cost: 21,000gp (Sword +2 15,000gp, 3/day *Word of Command* 1st level effect 6,000gp). Apparent Value: 657gp.

###### Sword +2, Valor

This **sword +2** has a 36” long backwards-curved blade of orichalcum set on an ivory hilt with inlaid silver. Its blade carries an inscription exhorting the wielder to bravery in Ancient Argollëan. Crafted during the Bitter War by the elves of southern Argollë, such swords were among the last magical blades forged by their Empyrean faction before its destruction. Three times per day, the wielder of the sword of valor can **inspire courage** as a bard. When this power is used, the sword sings a choral epic audible over the din of battle for one round. Base Cost: 21,000gp (Sword +2 15,000gp, 3/day 1st level effect 6,000gp). Apparent Value: 660gp.

###### Sword of Fortune

This unblemished blade is a pale shade of silver, made of a metal unknown to men and forged in fire to rival the sun. It functions in combat as a **sword +1** but did not earn its place in history for deeds of combat, nor for the +1 bonus to saving throws granted to its bearer. The sword’s fame comes from its greatest power, wrought into it fivefold times: to alter reality as the ritual spell *wish*. The historical record suggests three times this power was used, each by very different men: a desperate general reversing the course of a battle immediately after his army received a devastating cavalry charge; a patriarch of Türas traversing the world in the span of a single sun with a retinue of templars to destroy an awakening evil; and a tyrant repentant of his sins returning to life the friends he’d betrayed. As these claimed owners of the sword had no shortage of might, money, and magic, the opinions of sages vary as to which of these accomplishments truly expended a *wish*; the sword of fortune is found with 1d4+1 *wishes* remaining of its original five. Base Cost: 1,017,000gp (5 charges *Wish* 9th level esoteric ritual effect 1,000,000gp, sword +1 5,000gp, permanent (1/hour) 1st level effect 12,000gp). Apparent Value: 4,000gp.

###### Sword of Kings

This legendary blade was wielded by Arëtar Pendaelen when he slew the High King of Jutland on the banks of the River Rorn, and it is said that only a man as worthy as Arëtar can tap its powers. In the hands of an ordinary adventurer, it functions as an ordinary **sword +3**. If brandished by a worthy hero (a Lawful fighter with CHA 16 or higher, paladin, or similar martial champion of Law), it gains an additional **+1** bonus, for a total bonus of **+4**. Should the hero also rule a domain or realm, it gains another **+1** bonus, for a total bonus of **+5**. The hero-ruler also gains two additional powers drawn from the sword’s ties to the ancient rites of kingship. First, he deals an extra 2d6 points of extraordinary luminous damage when using the sword to strike a Chaotic creature in his domain or realm. Second, he attains a **oneness of land and lord**, adjusting his hit point total by twice the current morale score of his domain. Provided the wielder remains Lawful and healthy, his domain’s Land Value is increased by 2gp, as if it were benefitting from a *harvest* ritual. However, if the wielder is suffering from a curse or disease then his domain’s Land Value is decreased by 2gp, as if it were suffering from a *ravage* ritual. Base Cost: 181,000gp (Sword +5 105,000gp, permanent (1/3 turns) 3rd level effect 57,000gp, permanent (1/3 turns) 1st level effect 19,000gp). Apparent Value: 6,000gp.

###### Vorpal Sword

This **sword +4** is among the sharpest blades ever forged, with a sharp-faceted ruby set in the pommel of its gilded hilt and a blade that cuts through necks like butter. On any attack throw of an unmodified 20, the sword deals an additional die of extraordinary slashing piercing damage; additionally, the struck creature will be instantly slain by decapitation, unless it succeeds on a Death saving throw. At the Judge’s discretion, certain creatures might survive decapitation, such as slimes, constructs, hydras, and so on. This fabled sword has severed many a neck over the years, most famously the dwarven king Ebreo the Twice-Beheaded. Base Cost: 140,000gp (Sword +4 65,000gp, concentration 3rd level effect 75,000gp).Apparent Value: 5,000gp.

###### Miscellaneous Magic Weapons

The apparent value of any magic weapon is 650gp plus the base cost of the weapon unless detailed otherwise, equivalent to the value of a masterwork weapon. The apparent value of a single magic arrow, bolt or other projectile is likewise at least 32.5gp.

Magic arrows that strike their target are destroyed, but magic arrows that miss their target can be reclaimed after the battle and fired again. Magic polearms and spears only break on a natural 1 if the target is wearing magic armor and/or equipped with a magic shield of equal or greater bonus, or if the target is immune to ordinary piercing damage and has HD greater than 3 x the weapon’s bonus. The weapon’s bonus does not apply once broken.

###### Arrow +3, Death

Each black **arrow +3** of this kind is crafted to strike down one particular type of creature. If an archer speaks the arrow’s activation command (typically ‘seek’, ‘speed well’, or the like) before shooting it against that sort of creature and successfully strikes his target, his target will be instantly slain with no saving throw. An arrow of this kind may be activated only once, its death magic expended in vain should the attack miss or the arrow fly beyond a longbow or composite bow’s maximum range of 360’. The Judge can choose which creature type the arrow’s magic will slay, or roll on the Creature Type table at the beginning of this section. Base Cost: 4,750gp (Arrow +3 1,750gp, Single charge 6th level effect 3,000gp). Apparent Value: 35gp.

###### Bow of the Great Eagles

This legendary elven **composite bow +3** is crafted of laminated dawn redwood with its bow-limbs carved to resemble eagle’s talons. The elvish general Aedon Lann is credited with killing more than 500 orcs with the bowduring the Beastman Wars of the Third Century B.E. With an arrow nocked on the bow’s string, the wielder gains an eagle’s eyesight, letting him see eight times farther than normal and reducing his penalty for missile attacks made with the bow to -1 at medium range and to -2 at long range. He can make shots with pinpoint accuracy, able to fire at targets engaged in melee with a -4 penalty, as the Precise Shooting proficiency. If he already has ranks of Precise Shooting, the bow’s rank of proficiency stacks with his own.

Once per day, the wielder can fire an arrow skyward to call a large roc (see ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual*** for details) to his aid. The roc will fly from the nearest 24-mile wilderness hex of mountains terrain, requiring 1d6 hours if called from within such a hex, or an additional hour per additional 24-mile hex between that hex and the wielder’s location. If the wielder is unreachable upon its arrival (such as deep in a dungeon), the roc will circle the sky close by. The roc will understand the wielder’s speech and will serve as a loyal mount for a Lawful wielder or others that he directs, acting as if it were the wielder’s henchman for one day before departing (unless it is slain or **dispelled**). The roc will only grudgingly serve a Neutral wielder or rider, however, and if asked to perform a Chaotic action or assist a Chaotic creature it will immediately depart. The roc does notarrive with saddle and tack, nor does the bow grant the rider the Riding proficiency, so unproficient characters who ride the roc into battle do so at their own risk. The roc will not answer the wielder’s call if he has malicious intentions for the roc, such as to capture or kill it. Base Cost: 108,000gp (Composite bow +3 35,000gp, 1/day 6th level effect 30,000gp, permanent (1/hour) 2nd level effect 24,000gp, permanent (1/3 turns) 1st level effect 19,000gp). Apparent Value: 1,000gp.

###### Bow of the Unconquered Sun

This **composite bow** **+1**, **+2 versus avian creatures, +3 versus undead** is a relic of the Empyrean War, crafted of laminated dawn redwood and trimmed in golden orichalcum. It grants its wielder an additional attack each round, as the spell *swift sword*. Each arrow shot from the bow ignites with magical flame, dealing both extraordinary fire and extraordinary piercing damage plus an additional 1d6 extraordinary luminous damage. Base Cost: 170,000gp (Composite bow +1/+2 (two types)/+3 22,500gp, permanent (1/3 turns) *Swift Sword Sustained* 3rd level effect 57,000gp, permanent (1/3 turns) *Striking* 3rd level effect 57,000gp, permanent (1/day) 1st level effect 7,500gp). Apparent Value: 2,000gp.

###### Crossbow +1, Dragon’s Breath

Brought to fame by the dwarven mounted crossbowman Orin Eagleeye, this **crossbow +1, +2 vs beastmen** has a bronze tube bound below its fore-end which flares out the front, and a second trigger set ahead of the primary. Pressing the second trigger expends a charge and causes the tube to belch flame in a cone stretching 40’ long and 20’ wide, as the spell *fan of flames*. Each creature the wielder chooses to point his crossbow at within the cone must make a Blast saving throw, suffering 1d8 extraordinary fire damage if it fails, or half that if it succeeds. The crossbow is found with 1d4+1 charges remaining, its second trigger locking backward permanently when the last charge is expended. Base Cost: 12,500. (Crossbow +1/+2 10,000gp, 5 charges *Fan of Flames* 1st level effect 2,500gp). Apparent Value: 680gp.

###### Glaive of the Blade-Goddess

The bladedancer Aurëlyn Tarcalus wielded this renowned **polearm +3** at the Battle of the Fangs, when she held off the orc hordes that threatened to overwhelm the Auran right flank long enough for Malantavius to drive Thrax from the field. Its curved orichalcum blade mounted atop a tall oak pole deals an extra 1d6 extraordinary luminous damage per successful hit. The glaivecan be swung and spun with amazing swiftness, seemingly without any loss of momentum; its wielder gains a +1 bonus to initiative, and she still deals impact damage on a charge or countercharge when making sweep attacks with the glaive. Base Cost: 130,000gp (Polearm +3 35,000gp, permanent (1/3 turns) 3rd level effect 57,000gp, 2 permanent (1/3 turns) 1st level effects 19,000gp each). Apparent Value: 1,500gp.

###### Great Axe of the North

This long-bearded **great axe** **+3, +5 vs dragons and giants** has a rune-carved head and a sturdy yew haft gouged with bite-marks. The hero Sigvhan carried the axe during his expeditions against Dagr, the frost giant king, north of the Jutting Mountains. The sagas recount that Sigvhan died of wounds received felling Dagr and was interred with the axeby his comrades in a great burial mound on the slopes of Mount Skarstind. The axegrants its bearer **immunity** to mundane and extraordinary cold damage, and he automatically succeeds on saving throws against spells or special abilities that deal cold damage, as the spell *energy invulnerability.*

Once per day by gnawing on the haft of the axe for a full round, the wielder may enter a **greater berserkergang**. This grants him a +2 bonus to attack throws and damage rolls, immunity to fear, and decreases mundane damage suffered by 1 point per die. (Damage can be reduced to 0, but not less than 0, on each die). This protection increases to 2 points per die if the wielder is 7th level and 3 points per die if he is 13th level. However, while in this state his tactics become limited (as the Berserkergang proficiency) and he has trouble distinguishing friend from foe; if he rolls a natural 1 on an attack throw, he automatically hits a nearby ally within 5’ in lieu of his preferred target. The greater berserkergang ends only at the conclusion of combat, at which time the wielder becomes **fatigued** and **winded** until he rests for 1 turn. Base Cost: 137,000gp (Great axe +3/+5 (two types) 70,000gp, permanent (1/hour) *Energy Invulnerability* 4th level effect 48,000gp, permanent (1/3 turns) 1st level effect 19,000gp). Apparent Value: 660gp.

###### Javelin +3, Hurling

This **javelin +3** has a weighted pyramidal head of iron set atop a cedar shaft, fastened to a leather throwing strap. Once per turn, if the wielder speaks its command word and hurls the weapon at a wood or stone target larger than a man (such as a door, wall, or vessel) within the javelin’s 120’ thrown range, it will unerringly smash into the target with immense force, as the spell *battering ram*. It will deal 1d4 extraordinary seismic structural damage to a stone target or 1d4x5 to a wooden one (sufficient to knock down an oak door, break off a parapet, etc.) and blast shards of stone or splinters of wood from the target in a 5’ radius. Each creature in the area of effect must make a Blast saving throw. If the save fails, the creature suffers 3d6 mundane piercing damage, or half that if the save succeeds. The weapon returns itself to its wielder’s hand without fail whenever thrown, regardless of whether it hits or misses. Base Cost: 93,000gp (Javelin +3 35,000gp, 1/turn *Battering Ram* 2nd level effect 33,000gp, permanent (1/turn) 1st level effect (returning to hand) 25,000gp). Apparent Value: 651gp.

###### Scourge of Law

This infamous weapon was enchanted in the waning years of Zahar as a tool to detect and destroy practitioners of the heretical Empyrean faith. The rune-carved **flail +3**’s segmented hepatizon composition gives it a dark purplish copper patina.While the scourge is in hand the wielder sees a fiery red aura marking any creature within 45’ with hostile intentions towards him. If the scourge is wrapped around the neck of a helpless creature, the wielder can read the creature’s thoughts by concentrating, as the spell *telepathy*. Each time the scourgeis used to slay a Lawful creature in combat, the weapon’s damage bonus is temporarily increased by +1, up to a maximum damage bonus equal to the wielder’s HD. The damage bonus is lost when the combat ends or after one turn elapses, whichever comes first. Base Cost: 180,000gp (Flail +3 35,000gp, permanent (1/3 turns) 4th level effect 76,000gp, concentration 2nd level esoteric effect 50,000gp, permanent (1/3 turns) *Discern Evil* 1st level effect 19,000gp). Apparent Value: 655gp.

###### Shining Spear

This storied **spear +3, +4 versus undead, +5 versus demons** is crafted of ancient dawn redwood, tipped with a leaf-shaped spearhead of bright orichalcum, and counterbalanced by an orichalcum butt-spike. The speargrants its wielder immunity to fearwhile held. Three times per day by striking the butt-spike on the ground while reciting prayers to the Empyrean gods, the wielder can conjure a glowing *angelic aura*about himself to harm nearby undead for 7 rounds, as the spell. Base Cost: 120,500gp (Spear +3/+4 (2 types)/+5 77,500gp, 3/day *Angelic Aura* 4th level effect 24,000gp, permanent (1/3 turns) 1st level effect 19,000gp). Apparent Value: 3,000gp.

###### Spear +2, Wolf-Fang

This ashen **spear +2, +3 vs animals** is topped by a flat leaf-shaped spearhead of silver and capped by a bronze knob fastened in the shape of a howling wolf. Thrice per day the wielder can spend a round smearing a drop of his own blood over the spear to feel a gnawing in his belly; he will gain his choice of a hungry wolf’s hunting senses or a starving wolf’s heedless ferocity, as the Tracking or Berserkergang proficiency, with either one lasting for six turns. Base Cost: 34,000gp (Spear +2/+3 25,000gp, 3/day 1.5th level effect 9,000gp). Apparent Value: 653gp.

###### War Hammer +2, Dwarven Hurler

Famously used in the Jutting Mountains to cave in both the helm and skull of a frost giant chieftain at 30 paces, this **war hammer +2** is made from king’s steel, with an octagonal head and a grip made of polar bear leather. When wielded by a dwarf, the hammer gains an additional **+1** bonus (becoming a **war hammer** **+3**) and can be hurled with a 60’ range. When hurled, it deals an extra 1d6 extraordinary luminous damage, or 2d6 against giant humanoids. It unerringly returns to the dwarf’s hand after being thrown. Base Cost: 136,000gp. War hammer +3 35,000gp, permanent (1/3 turns) 4th level effect (variable damage bonus when thrown) 76,000gp, permanent (1/turn) 1st level effect (returning to hand) 25,000gp. Apparent Value: 655gp.

#### Armors

The apparent value of any magic armor or shield is 650gp plus the base cost of the armor or shield unless detailed otherwise, equivalent to the value of a masterwork set of armor or shield.

###### Armor of the First Vaultlord

The peerless dwarven smith Korten Khador created many wondrous works in his life. One of his first masterpieces was a flawlessly crafted set of armor worn by the vault lords of Azen Khador and passed down through generations of successors. The ultimate fate of the armor is unknown, but dwarven tradition holds that it rests in the royal tomb of its final wearer. The great work is a set of **plate armor +3**, made to suffer a million blows without defeat and receiving a blow during its creation in anticipation of each of those million, leaving it with a hammered pattern. The armor lacks even a single gap in its protection; said to have been struck so many times that no new blow can surprise it, the wearer is **immune** to all bonus damage and effects normally triggered upon an attack throw with an unmodified die roll of 20, such as from the Weapon Focus proficiency, the vicious decapitating bites of certain dragons and cacodemons, or the **vorpal sword**. Additionally, the grandmaster smith’s million successive blows left the armor so hard that new strikes find little purchase, granting its wearer partial invulnerability to harm. Any mundane physical damage the wearer suffers is reduced by 1 point per die; damage can be reduced to 0, but not less than 0, on each die. Base Cost: 130,000gp. (Plate +3 35,000gp, permanent (1/3 turns) 4th level effect (critical hit immunity) 76,000gp, permanent (1/3 turns) 1st level effect (damage reduction) 19,000gp). Apparent Value 3,000gp.

###### Armor of the Invincible Conqueror

According to legend, the hero Valerian Bellësareus wore the **armor of the invincible conqueror** during his duel with his brother, the ruinguard Acherib, at the height of the Empyrean War. Crafted of gleaming orichalcum, this suit of archaic **plate armor +3** deflects all attacks directed at its wearer which deal mundane damage, causing them to automatically miss. A deflected attack with an area of effect (such as from a siege weapon) rolls for scatter to determine the direction and distance deflected, and can still harm the wearer if he ends up in the area of effect. The armor will not deflect attacks made by silver weapons. Base Cost: 130,000gp (Plate armor +3 35,000gp, permanent (1/3 turns) *Deflect Ordinary Weapons* 5th level effect 95,000gp). Apparent Value 2,500gp.

###### Shield +1, Burden

Famously used by the hero Alpin Hruk to bring back the body of vaultlord Arsic Taran during an hours-long running battle, this circular **shield +1** is 3’ across, with a procession of dwarves carrying heavy loads depicted in a spiral pattern on its face. If the shield is set with its inside facing up and has something placed upon it, it will rise to float at waist level, able to bear up to 50 stone. The shield remains still while within 10’ of the activator, gently following at his speed if he moves away. The shield can be pushed as needed to position it, but ceases floating if moved more than 10’ from the activator, or if tilted from its horizontal alignment (such as to use it as a shield again). Base Cost: 17,000gp (Shield +1 5,000gp, permanent (1/hour) 1st level effect 12,000gp). Apparent Value 660gp.

###### Shield of the Empyrean Heavens

This legendary **shield +4** was brought down from Mt. Audarammas by Azendor, prophet of Ammonar, and used by a succession of heroes during the Empyrean War. Like other shields from that archaic era, the shield of the empyrean heavens is approximately 3’ in diameter, with scooped indentations on either side that give it an hourglass-like shape. It is faced with orichalcum and painted with the symbol of the winged sun. The bearer of the shield is **immune** to all bonus damage and effects normally triggered upon an attack throw with an unmodified die roll of 20, such as from the weapon focus proficiency, the vicious decapitating bites of certain dragons and cacodemons, or the **vorpal sword**. The bearer and all creatures within 5’ of him are **immune** to damage and effects caused by blast spells and spell-like abilities, as the spell **greater blast ward**. Once per day, by clanging his weapon against the shield, the bearer can enable 5 allies within 90’ to move at double their normal speed and make one additional attack on their next initiative, as the spell **holy prayer**. Due to the potency of its enchantment, even most artifact weapons have no chance to sunder the shield. Base Cost: 228,000gp (Shield +4 65,000, permanent (1/hour) *Greater Blast Ward* 6th level permanent effect 72,000gp, permanent (1/3 turns) 4th level effect (critical hit immunity) 76,000gp, *Holy Prayer* 1/day 3rd level effect 15,000gp). Apparent Value 11,000gp.

###### Shield of the Iron Curtain

This distinctive round steel **shield +3** has its spiked boss crafted to depict the roof of a mighty gold-topped citadel viewed from above, ringed on the shield’s face by layer upon layer of gleaming silver walls with bronze-armored dwarves behind them. Borne with distinction by a succession of Meniran heroes during the Beastmen Wars, the legendary shield’s deeds inspired the dwarven military cadence *Asleep Behind the Iron Curtain*. The shield of the iron curtain is carried like a natural extension of its bearer’s arm, instantly readied to turn aside blows, and is wielded as though he has the Fighting Style (weapon and shield) proficiency. The rear of the shield is wholly engraved with a spiral of dwarven litanies of protection and warding, and this magic radiates outward from the shield. Every dwarf within a 30’ radius of the shield receives an additional +1 bonus to their AC (including the shield’s wielder, if a dwarf); if carried on the battlefield, this bonus is granted to up to a company-sized unit of dwarves while the wielder is attached to the unit. This AC bonus is lost if the bearer is slain or drops the shield. Base Cost: 126,000gp (Shield +3 35,000gp, permanent 1st level effect (proficiency) 19,000gp, permanent (1/hr) 6th level effect (AC bonus 30’ radius) 72,000gp). Apparent Value 1,500gp.

### Magic Item Traits (Optional)

The following tables provide a means of making magical items more unique and desirable (or horrific) and inspiring further ideas, without adding extra power beyond possible minor benefits. These traits can be selected by you or rolled as desired, and should reflect the sort of item or its origin. Even odd combinations can be used, however; a **+1 sword of ever-decaying flesh and bone** would make a fine device for a necromantic foe, and its inherent magic would allow it to function normally.

At this end of this section, rules are also included for generating these minor magical traits when crafting magical items – though unless the creator is notably powerful, the results can be unpredictable.

#### Minor Magical Effects in Crafting

With the exception of potions, scrolls, and other magical consumables, there is always a chance that a given magical creation exhibits one or more minor magical trait, as follows:

* Base 1% per 1,000gp of material cost.
* If the total chance exceeds 100%, the excess beyond 100% becomes the chance of a second minor magical trait.
* If the creator is 11th level or higher, they can choose the trait from the appropriate table instead of rolling for it, such is their puissance.

EXAMPLE: Bukhat is creating a **sword +3** (base cost 35,000gp). It has a 35% chance of exhibiting a single minor magical effect.

The table rolled on should be chosen by you based on the creator’s alignment, tendencies, and class; the materials used in the item’s construction; the type of magical item being made; and the location of its forging. An item crafted by one of Ammonar’s faithful and bathed in the full light of the sun every day would likely use the Holy/Lawful table. An item crafted from dark iron, decorated with cut crystal, and buried in the earth every day during its creation would use the Earth table, and so on.

EXAMPLE: Bukhat has crafted his **sword +3** from polished brass, decorated it with cut obsidian and rubies, and held it over flame every day. The Judge assesses that he should roll on the Fire table.

Even if a magic research roll fails, the roll for a minor magical effect should still be made if there is a chance of one.

EXAMPLE: Bukhat does not have a formula for a **sword +3**, so he must make a magic research throw. Unfortunately, Bukhat fails the throw and the sword does not get its +3 bonus! However, he still consults the Fire table for a minor magical effect. Because he is 14th level, he chooses “Heatless fire engulfs it when wielded, illuminating like a candle”. Had he been lower than 11th level, he would have had to roll on the table instead of selecting a result. Bukhat has failed to create an epic sword of fire, but he has created a minor magical item (a sword that illuminates like a torch).

When used in combat, weapons that end up with no bonus to hit or damage but still have a minor magical effect count as silver weapons.

# PART II: CONSTRUCTION

# Chapter 6: Realms

After creating your setting, you will want to undertake the next step: building the realms that will populate your setting using the mechanics of *ACKS*. By creating these realms, you prepare the way for your adventurers to become conquerors and kings of these territories as they advance in level.

If you’ve created your sandbox using the recommendations in the prior chapter, building the realms that populate it will be a very easy process. If you’ve created a sandbox using an alternative approach, or if you want to build the realms for your entire setting’s entire continent, it’s a bit more work. The steps below assume you’re following our recommended approach, with notes afterwards offering suggestions on how to handle alternative approaches.

## The Basics of Realm Building

The mechanics of domains and realms described in ***ACKS II***are designed to create a very particular pattern, where realms of certain sizes are ruled by rulers of particular experience levels, resulting in a hierarchy where high-level NPCs ruling vast empires through vassals in several layers that terminate in low-level NPC barons ruling small domains.

The two tables below show how this pattern works. The **Realms by Type** table shows a number of different types of realms, ranging from lowly baronies to huge empires. For each type of realm, the table provides the realm ruler’s expected level, the realm’s population in families, the number of individual domains in the realm, and the size of the realm in square miles, 6-mile hexes, and 24-mile hexes. (Note that this data corresponds with the tiers shown in **Tiers by Realm Size** table in the **Strongholds and Domains** rules in Chapter 8 of ***ACKS II RR***). The **Political Divisions of Realms** table shows how many vassal realms of each type exist within a larger realm. If desired, each of these vassal realm can, in turn, be described using the Realms by Type table.

There are several mechanical reasons why this pattern occurs in *ACKS.* The first and most important reason is the game’s unique **monthly XP threshold** mechanic. The monthly XP threshold is in many ways the “secret sauce” that powers *ACKS* campaign play. When a ruler rules a domain or realm, he gains campaign XP for income over his monthly XP threshold, which causes him to advance in level. However, as the ruler advances in level, his monthly XP threshold increases. Therefore, the character will gain fewer and fewer XP from his rulership as he advances in level, until eventually he reaches a plateau beyond which he cannot advance without enlarging his realm. Low-level characters who end up in control of powerful realms either level up quickly or end up removed from power by vassals who’d like to level up. In either case, the “appropriate” level of ruler ends up in charge.

The second reason that this pattern is certain to occur is the game’s **personal authority** mechanic. The personal authority mechanic modifies domain morale based on the ruler’s experience level relative to the amount of income his domain generates. While a high-level ruler can control a large and wealthy domain, if he attempts to despotically dominate a vast territory without allocating some of it to vassals, he will find his domain morale is harshly penalized. Such domains suffer exactly the sort of rebellions and unrest that make it possible for ambitious rulers of lesser domains to conquer them. The personal authority mechanic makes it inevitable that large realms transform into a series of vassal realms run by governors, proconsuls, satraps, etc.

The third reason for the pattern’s recurrence is the **tribute inefficiency** mechanic. The tribute inefficiency mechanic imposes a financial penalty on rulers who attempt to extract tribute from more than eight different vassals. It thus has the opposite effect of the personal authority mechanic. The former mechanics causes realms to be divided up among vassals; this mechanic prevents realms from being divided up between too many vassals.

The final reason for the pattern’s inevitable occurrence is the **non-henchman vassal** mechanic. Every ruler has only a limited number of available henchmen, which he must allocate to duties such as bodyguard, military commander, magistrate, and vassal ruler. Realms which are divided into too many vassal domains force the ruler to rely on non-henchman vassals, who are untrustworthy and prone to rebel. Like the tribute inefficiency mechanic, the non-henchman vassal mechanic prevents realms from being divided up too much.

These four mechanics work in tandem such that the optimal way to structure a domain is to structure it in something very much like the pattern described in the tables above. In short, *ACKS* creates an “efficient market for experience points” where each ruler, in order to maximize his own personal accumulation of XP, is guided by the ‘invisible hand’ of the game mechanics to create realms structured just like those in the tables above.

Of course, just as in real-world markets, such patterns really only represent long-term tendencies. In the short term, there will always be some realms that are inefficiently structured, some realms whose ruler has recently died and left behind a weak or inadequate heir, some realms run by adventurers more powerful than their title would suggest, and so on. Such variations from the pattern create just the sort of opportunities for conquest that *ACKS* players need! Indeed, the activities of the player characters can be understood as being the very market forces that create the optimal pattern.

With those fundamentals in mind, let’s build the realms in your sandbox.

## Step 1: Estimate Realm Size

The **ACKS Regional Map** hex sheet that you used for your sandbox is 31.5 hexes tall and 49 hexes wide, with a total of 1,543 6-mile hexes on the map. You’ve set aside somewhere between one-third (514 hexes) and one-half (771 hexes) of the hexes for your chaotic zone. That leaves 771 to 1,028 6-mile hexes that could potentially be part of a realm.

However, not all of those hexes will be part of the realm; deserts, forests, jungles, swamps, and similar inhospitable terrain won’t be settled (at least not by humans). Count or estimate the number of grassland, hill, river, and scrubland hexes outside of your chaotic hill, river, and scrub hexes – that’s the number of hexes in your realm. For a typical map on an **ACKS Regional Map** sheet, you’ll have about 350 to 600 6-mile hexes.

In the Borderlands sandbox, much of the territory on the map is taken up by the Lusaun Forest, Viaspen Forest, Viamir Marshes, Meniri Mountains, and Waste, with the result that only around 400 hexes are available as inhabited territory.

## Step 2: Determine Realm Type

Consulting the Realms by Type table, we look for the type of realm that encompasses a region of 350 to 1,028 6-mile hexes. We see that Principalities are 280-1,050 hexes in size. Therefore the major realm in your sandbox is certainly a Principality. As such, it will be ruled by an 11th or 12th level Prince whose immediate vassals will be 9th – 10th level dukes. The Prince will reside in and rule from the sandbox’s capital city, which you placed near the middle of the lawful zone in Step 7(b)(ii) last chapter.

In the Auran Empire campaign setting, Principalities are referred to as “Prefectures.” The Borderlands is a Prefecture ruled by the 11th level Prefect Basilio from its capital city of Cyfaraun.

## Step 3: Determine Vassal Realm Types

Consulting the Political Divisions of Realms table, we see that a typical Principality has 4 to 6 Duchies beneath it. Recall that in step 7(b)(iii) of your setting construction, you placed another 4 to 6 smaller urban settlements in a loose ring around the capital city. Each of those settlements is ruled by a Duke of 9th to 10th level who controls a Duchy of 67 – 172 6-mile hexes as a vassal to the Prince.

If you are feeling bold, you can pick one settlement (whichever is furthest from the capital) and make it an independent city-state, dwarven vault, elven fastness, or other settlement outside the Principality. You can replace it with one of the strongholds you placed in step 7(b)(iv) if desired to make sure you still have 4 to 6 Duchies within the Principality.

In the Auran Empire campaign setting, Duchies are called “Palatinates” and ruled by Palatines. We placed four settlements around Cyfaraun – Azen Radokh, Menicos, Samos, and Siadanos. However, we made Azen Radokh a dwarven vault that was outside the direct rule of the prefect. We replaced it by making the huge stronghold of Türos Orn one of the seats of power for the vassal ruler. Thus, the Prefect Basilio has four Palatines as vassals, ruling Palatinates around Menicos, Samos, Siadanos, and Türos Orn respectively.

## Step 4: Determine Sub-Vassal Realm Types

Returning to the Political Divisions of Realms table, we see that a typical Duchy has 4 to 6 Counties beneath it. In sub-steps 7(b)(i) and 7(b)(iv) in the last chapter, you placed a total of 17 to 26 strongholds. (You might have one less if you used one of your strongholds to replace an independent city-state or vault.) Each of those strongholds is ruled by a Count of 7th to 8th level who controls a County of 15 to 30 6-mile hexes as vassal to one of the Dukes. Assign the individual strongholds to the Dukes such that each Duke has between 4 and 6 Counts beneath him. Don’t worry about rulers below the level of Count at this stage.

In the Auran Empire campaign setting, Counties are called “Legatures” and ruled by Legates. Recall that last chapter we placed 13 strongholds in 7(b)(i) and 8 strongholds in step 7(b)(iv); that’s 21 strongholds in total. One of those forts, however, we used in Step 3 above to replace Azen Radokh as the seat of power for a Duchy. Therefore we have 20 strongholds remaining. We assign 5 strongholds to each of the 4 Palatines. Thus, each Palatine has 5 Legates as vassals, each ruling Legatures around their strongholds.

## Step 5: Estimate Domain Populations and Incomes

The **Revenue by Realm Type** table below shows the size of the personal domain of various tiers of nobility, their monthly income from domains, and their monthly income from urban settlements. The Revenue by Realm Type table assumes that at each tier of nobility, the nobles have 4-6 vassals of the next tier below them, who each hold a vassal realm, as per the Political Division of Realms.

|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Revenue by Realm Type** | | | | | |
| **Type of**  **Realm** |  | **Personal Domain**  **(families)** | **Stronghold**  **Value (gp)** | **Realm Population**  **(families)** | **Domain Income/**  **Month (gp)** |
| Empire |  | ~ 12,500 | 720,000+ | 1.5M – 11.6M+ | 250,000-425,000+ |
| Kingdom |  | ~ 12,500 | 480,000 | 364K – 2,000K | 120,000-215,000 |
| Principality |  | ~ 7,500 | 360,000 | 87K – 322K | 50,000-100,000 |
| Duchy |  | ~ 1,500 | 115,000 | 20,000 – 52,000 | 14,500-30,000 |
| County |  | ~ 780 | 70,000 | 3,600 – 10,000 | 5,000-10,000 |
| March |  | ~ 320 | 45,000 | 960 – 1,280 | 2,000-3,200 |
| Barony |  | ~ 160 | 22,500 | 120-200 | 450-760 |

Since that’s exactly the pattern you’ve established in your sandbox, you can use this chart to quickly estimate the population and income of the Princes, Dukes, and Counts in our sandbox. You do not need to “build” every domain in detail as if it were a PC domain – all you need are approximations when your campaign begins.

In the Borderlands, the Prefect of Cyfaraun has a personal domain of 7,500 families; a realm population of 95,970 families; and a domain income of 62,400gp. Each Palatine has a personal domain of around 1,250 families; a realm population of around 21,500 families; and a domain income of around 19,000gp. Each Legate has a personal domain of around 725 families; a realm population of around 3,825 families; and a domain income of around 5,150gp. All of these are within the ranges on the table above. (You can find the full domain sheets with exact numbers for the rulers of the Borderlands in ***AX3 Capital of the Borderlands***.)

After you’ve made some income estimates, pause and compare the income estimates to the monthly XP thresholds by class level in ***ACKS II****.* What you should see is that each ruler’s income is within one level of the XP threshold for his level. For instance, Prefect Basilio of Cyfaraun is 11th level, with an XP threshold of 45,000. His income is 62,400gp, so Basilio is earning (62,400 – 45,000) 17,400 XP each month. Eventually he’ll reach 12th level, and his XP threshold will jump to 75,000. At that point his income will cease earning him XP and he’ll need to somehow expand his realm. In other words, just by comparing income, class level, and monthly XP threshold you can determine if the NPC is ambitious to expand, content with his lot, or out of his league!

## Step 6: Estimate Urban Settlement Sizes

The **Villages, Towns, and Cities of the Realm** table shows the overall urban population based on the number of peasant families present in any given realm (or portion thereof). Note that the monthly revenue of various urban settlements has already been factored into the values listed on the Revenue by Realm Type table.

|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Villages, Towns, and Cities Placement** | | | | |
| **Realm/Domain**  **Population**  **(families)** | **Urban**  **Population**  **(families)** | **Largest**  **Settlement**  **(families)** | **Monthly**  **Income (gp)** | **Market**  **Class** |
| 3,749- | 374- | Hamlets (74-) | 0gp | Class VI\* |
| 3,750-4,999 | 375-499 | Small Village (75-99) | 150- 199gp | Class VI |
| 5,000-7,999 | 500-799 | Village (100-159) | 200 – 319gp | Class VI |
| 8,000-12,499 | 800-1,249 | Village (160-249) | 320 – 624gp | Class VI |
| 12,500-22,499 | 1,250-2,249 | Large village (250-499) | 625 – 1124gp | Class V |
| 22,500-31,249 | 2,500-3,124 | Small town (500-624) | 1125 – 1559gp | Class IV |
| 31,250-62,499 | 3,125-6,249 | Large town (625-1,249) | 1560 – 3124gp | Class IV |
| 62,500-124,999 | 6,250-12,499 | Small city (1,250-2,499) | 3125 – 6249gp | Class IV |
| 125,000-249,999 | 12,500-24,999 | City (2,500-4,999) | 6250 – 14,999gp | Class III |
| 250,000-499,999 | 25,000-49,999 | Large city (5,000-9,999) | 15,000 – 29,999go | Class II |
| 500,000-749,999 | 50,000-74,999 | Large city (10,000-14,999) | 30,000 – 44,999gp | Class II |
| 750,000-1,999,999 | 75,000-199,999 | Large city (15,000-19,999) | 45,000 – 69,999gp | Class II |
| 2,000,000-3,999,999 | 200,000-399,999 | Metropolis (20,000-39,999) | 70,000 – 139,999gp | Class I |
| 4,000,000+ | 400,000+ | Metropolis (40,000+) | 140,000+ | Class I |

\*A Class VI market will exist at the domain’s stronghold only.

Use this table to estimate the size and market class of each of the urban settlements you’ve placed in your sandbox, starting with the Principality, then proceeding on to the Duchies and Counties. Again, don’t worry about anything smaller than the Counties at this point.

Your Principality will have 87,000 to 322,000 families. Therefore, the Principality’s largest settlement could be a small city (1,250 – 2,499 families), a city (2,500 – 4,999 families), or a large city (5,000 – 9,999), of market class III, III, or II respectively. We recommend making the capital city of your Principality a city with 2,500 to 4,9999 families that functions as Class III market.

Your Duchies will each have 20,000 to 52,000 families. Therefore, each Duchy’s largest settlement could be a large village (250 – 499 families), a small town (500 – 624 families), or a large town (625 – 12,49 families), of market class V, IV, or IV respectively. We recommend having each Duchy’s settlement be a small town with 500 to 624 families that functions as a Class IV market. You can make the settlements smaller, but we do not recommend making them larger; large towns will transform too much of your sandbox into civilization (see Step 8).

Finally, your Counties will each have 4,600 to 8,500 families. Therefore, each County’s largest settlement will be a small village (75-99 families) or village (100-249 families). We recommend having each County’s settlement be a village of 100 to 249 families that functions as a Class VI market. If the adventurers will be based out of one of the Counties when the campaign begins, you can bump the market class to Class V to make their lives a little easier.

In the Borderlands, Cyfaraun is a city with 2,550 families and market class III. Menicos is a small town with 568 families and market class IV. Samos is a small town with 532 families and market class IV. Siadanos is a small town with 551 families and market class IV. Türos Orn is a small town with 549 families and market class IV; and all of the forts have villages with 75 – 160 families and market class VI. Türos Tem is bumped to market class V because it’s the starting settlement for the Borderlands sandbox; this is justified in-world by Türos Tem’s key position in the middle of the Unbroken Line.

## Step 7: Generate Demand Modifiers

Now that you know the market class of all the strongholds and settlements in your sandbox, you can determine the demand modifiers for the various markets. If any of your players has rolled up a venturer or expressed interest in pursuing mercantile ventures, you should attend to this step before the first session of play. Otherwise, you can come back to this step once your players have begun to think about trade and commerce.

When generating demand modifiers, you can assign the demand modifiers for the markets at your discretion in order to reflect a desired pattern of trade routes and commerce for your setting, or you can randomly generate the demand modifiers using the following rules if you prefer procedural methods.

### A. Randomly Determine Base Demand Modifiers

Roll 1d3-1d3 for each type of merchandise, giving a range of -2 to +2 for the market.

### B. Apply Environmental Adjustments

Adjust the base demand modifiers for each type of merchandise based on the domain’s environment, including its age, water source (if any), climate, and elevation. Simply consult the **Environmental Adjustments to Demand** table, below, and apply all relevant modifiers for the market. (You can apply multiple modifiers from the Water Source and Biome/Climate segments where appropriate.) Drop any fractions remaining after all modifiers have been applied.

EXAMPLE: The Judge is designing a domain beyond the borders of Southern Argollë. The domain is located on a hilly section of sylvan woods (deciduous forest, hills) near the Mirmen River (river bank). It has never been settled before, so its age is 0. Beginning with Grain, he starts generating his new domain’s demand modifiers. He rolls 1d3-1d3 for Grain and gets a score of -1. This is then modified by an additional -1 (0 years old), -1 (river bank), and -1/2 (deciduous forest), for a total of -3 1/2. Dropping the fraction, he notes that his domain has a demand modifier of -3 for Grain. This process is repeated for each other type of merchandise.

### C. Apply Domain-specific Adjustments

As explained in ***ACKS II****,* each domain has land revenue of 3gp to 9gp, reflecting whether some lands are rich in farm produce, timber, furs, and other resources. Others have barren, infertile soil with limited natural resources. These factors will affect the demand modifiers of the domain’s market. Domains with limited resources have a higher demand for goods and must pay more for them.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Domain Land Revenue** | **Demand Modifiers** |
| 3gp | +1 Demand Modifier to 6 merchandise types, -1 Demand modifier to 1 merchandise type |
| 4gp | +1 Demand Modifier to 4 merchandise types, -1 Demand modifier to 1 merchandise type |
| 5gp | +1 Demand Modifier to 2 merchandise types, -1 Demand Modifier to 1 merchandise type |
| 6gp | +1 Demand Modifier to 1 merchandise type, -1 Demand modifier to 1 merchandise type |
| 7gp | -1 Demand Modifier to 2 merchandise types, +1 Demand Modifier to 1 merchandise type |
| 8gp | -1 Demand Modifier to 4 merchandise types, +1 Demand Modifier to 1 merchandise type |
| 9gp | -1 Demand Modifier to 6 merchandise types, +1 Demand Modifier to 1 merchandise type |

The specific types of merchandise affected can be determined randomly using the Random Merchandise table (see ***ACKS II Revised Rulebook*** p. XX)or selected to reflect the history and culture of the campaign setting. A domain in a pseudo-Chinese culture might have negative demand modifiers for porcelain and silk, but a positive demand modifier for mounts, while a domain in a pseudo-Viking culture might have a negative demand modifier for furs and fish, but a positive demand modifier for silk.

EXAMPLE: The new domain has land revenue of 8gp, so the Judge must roll for four negative demand modifiers and one positive Demand modifier. He decides to randomly generate the domain-specific adjustments, starting with the negative modifiers. Rolling on the Common Merchandise table, he rolls a 94, directing him to the Precious Merchandise table. He rolls a 39, so his domain has a -1 demand modifier on precious metals. The Judge decides that that there are gold mines in the hills nearby. He repeats this process for the other three negative and one positive demand modifiers.

### D. Apply Racial Adjustments

The demi-human races are noted for their production of certain merchandise, and their demand for others.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Race** | **Demand Modifiers** |
| Dwarf | -2 Demand Modifier to beer/ale, common metals, tools, armor/weapons, rare metals, semi-precious stones, and gems  +2 Demand Modifier to common wood, common furs, grain/vegetables, oils & sauces, rare furs, rare woods, and ivory |
| Elf | -2 Demand Modifier to botanicals, common wood, dyes/pigments, clothing, glassware, porcelain, textiles  +2 Demand Modifier to grain/vegetables, monster parts, rare books, salt, silk, semi-precious stones, and gems |

### E. Determine Trade Routes

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Market Class** | **Range of Trade (Road)** | **Range of Trade (Water)** |  |
| Class VI | 24 miles (4 hexes) | 48 miles (8 hexes) |  |
| Class V | 48 miles (8 hexes) | 96 miles (16 hexes) |  |
| Class IV | 72 miles (12 hexes) | 120 miles (20 hexes) |  |
| Class III | 96 miles (18 hexes) | 240 miles (40 hexes) |  |
| Class II | 144 miles (24 hexes) | 360 miles (60 hexes) |  |
| Class I | 168 miles (28 hexes) | 480 miles (80 hexes) |  |

Markets may enjoy a regular exchange of goods with other markets along a **trade route.** For a trade route to exist, two criteria must be met. First, the markets must be connected by a road, trail, or navigable waterway. Second, both markets must be within each other’s range of trade, as listed on the Range of Trade table.

EXAMPLE: A castle (Class VI) is located along a road 24 miles from a large town (Class IV) and 96 miles from a city (Class III). The large town and the city are 72 miles apart. A trade route exists between the castle and the large town, and between the large town and the city, but not between the castle and the city, as the 96 mile distance is greater than the castle’s range of trade.

When a trade route connects two markets, the smaller market has all of its demand modifiers shifted by 2 points closer to the larger market’s demand modifiers (or set equal to the larger market’s demand modifiers if separated by less than 2 points). If the two markets connected by the trade route are of equal size, each shifts each of its demand modifiers by 1 point closer to the other market’s demand modifiers.

When shifting demand modifiers for a region, start with the largest market and work outward to each its direct trade routes, starting with the largest settlement it trades with. Proceed from there to the next smallest, and so on. If two markets are of the same size, then start with the one that is closest. If equidistant, choose or roll randomly.

|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Demand**  **Modifier** | **Cyfaraun** | **Samos**  **(original)** | **Samos**  **(trade route)** |  |
| Wood, common | -3 | -2 | -3 |  |
| Hides, furs | -3 | -1 | -3 |  |
| Metals, common | -2 | -3 | -2 |  |
| Grain | +1 | -2 | 0 |  |
| Spices | +1 | 0 | +1 |  |
| Silk | +1 | 0 | +1 |  |

EXAMPLE: Cyfaraun, a Class IV city in Southern Argollë, and Samos, a Class V town down the road about 48 miles away, share a trade route. Cyfaraun will therefore shift all of Samos’s demand modifiers by 2 points closer to its own, as shown on the table below. The trade route has equalized much of the demand in the two markets.

## Step 8: Demarcate the Territory of the Realm

The next step in the process of building your realm is to make a political map of the domains in your realm. This step, and all subsequent steps, are optional at this point. They will not matter much to your campaign until your players have advanced in several levels of experience. You can start your campaign and play for dozens of sessions without issue; we know because we did just that in the Auran Empire campaign! That said, at some point the player characters will advance into conqueror-tier play and you’ll want to be ready for that by knowing who rules what.

### A. Demarcate the Territory of the Prince’s Personal Domain

Earlier, in Step 5, you estimated the population of the Prince’s personal domain. Now you’re going to finalize that number and use it to demarcate the territory that belongs to your Prince. Although most of your sandbox is going to have a low population density (discussed below), the territory ruled by your Prince is going to be densely-populated, as befitting a capital region – 450 to 550 families per hex is a good number. Divide the number of families in the Prince’s personal domain by that value to calculate the number of 6-miles of territory in the Principality. Draw borders on your regional map that encompass that number of hexes for the prince’s personal domain.

In the Borderlands, we decided the Prefect (Prince) had a personal domain of 7,500 families with a population density of 500 families per hex. Therefore the Prince’s personal domain had a territory of 15 6-mile hexes.

![](data:image/png;base64...)

### B. Determine Peasant Population Density for Remainder of Sandbox

In this step, you’ll choose the population density of peasant families in your sandbox. This is important because the size of the rulers’ domains is largely determined by their population relative to their population density. The table below shows the Population Density of various historical regions. Since your sandbox is supposed to be a somewhat dangerous frontier territory, we recommend a population density of 20-30 people per square mile (125 – 185 peasant families per 6-mile hex) which is about the population density of the Roman Imperial frontier areas. Choosing a value of 185 or below means that you don’t have to worry about the limits of growth on any hex – they can be civilized, borderlands, or outlands without affecting the population in the hex.

For the Borderlands, we chose a population density of 30 people per square mile and 185 peasant families per hex.

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Historical Era/Region** | **Approx. Population Density** | **Families per 6-mile Hex** | **Families per 24-mile Hex** |
| Medieval-era Scotland | 20 people / square mile | 125 | 2,000 |
| Imperial-era Germany | 30 people / square mile | 185 | 3,000 |
| Medieval era England | 40 people / square mile | 250 | 4,000 |
| Imperial-era Roman Empire (all) | 50 people / square mile | 300 | 5,000 |
| Imperial-era Mesopotamia | 60 people / square mile | 375 | 6,000 |
| Imperial-era Italy | 70 people / square mile | 435 | 7,000 |
| Imperial-era Greece | 80 people / square mile | 500 | 8,000 |
| Medieval-era Holy Roman Empire | 90 people / square mile | 560 | 9,000 |
| Medieval-era France | 100 people / square mile | 625 | 10,000 |

### C. Demarcate the Territory of the Dukes’ Personal Domains

Now you’re going to use the population density you’ve chosen in 7(B) to determine the size of each of the Duke’s personal domains. Just divide the number of families by the population density to calculate the number of 6-mile hexes in each Duke’s territory. If you’ve been following our recommendations, each of the Dukes will have a personal domain of around 1,250 – 1,750 peasant families, so their territory will be around 7 to 9 hexes each. Draw borders on your regional map that encompass the appropriate number of hexes for each Duke’s personal domain.

In the Borderlands, each of the Palatines (Dukes) has a personal domain of around 1,250 families. At 185 peasant families per hex, that’s (1,250 / 185) = 6.75 hexes per Palatine, rounded to 7 hexes. 7 hexes is our preferred size for a domain centered on an urban settlement because it encompasses the settlement’s hex and 6 other adjacent hexes.

![](data:image/png;base64...)

### D. Demarcate the Territory of the Counts’ Personal Domains

Now you’re going to use the population density again to determine the size of each of the Count’s personal domains. Again divide the number of families by the population density to calculate the number of 6-mile hexes in each Count’s territory. If you’ve been following our recommendations, each of the Counts will have a personal domain of around 700 – 850 peasant families, so their territory will be around 4 to 6 hexes each. Draw borders on your regional map that encompass the appropriate number of hexes for each Counts’ personal domain.

In the borderlands, each of the Legates (Counts) has a personal domain of around 725 peasant families. At 185 peasant families per hex, that’s (725 / 185) = 4 hexes per Legate.

![](data:image/png;base64...)

### E. Demarcate the Territory of the Counties

Each Counts is assumed to have 4 - 6 Viscounts and 16 - 24 Barons beneath him. However, we don’t need or want to model those rulers – it makes the map far too messy and it’s largely irrelevant to gameplay.

Instead, we’re going to abstract them. Back in Step 5, you estimated the size of each Count’s realm and personal domain and in Step 6 you estimate the size of each count’s urban settlement. If you followed our recommendations, it’ll be around 4,600 – 8,500 peasant families and 100 to 250 urban families. Add those together and subtract the total from number of families in each Count’s realm. That tells us how many peasant families are spread out across the various Viscounts and Barons. We then divide that total by the population density of our sandbox and – voila! – we know how much territory is required for the Viscounts and Baronies in total. Add that to the number of hexes in the Count’s personal domain and that’s the size of each County. Draw borders on your regional map that encompass the appropriate number of hexes for each County.

For simplicity, we recommend making the Counties contiguous so that all of the territory held by Viscounts and Barons can be accessed by the Count without having to travel through another ruler’s realm. However, depending on the terrain of your map, this might not be possible; sometimes you will need to split a realm into parts spread across the map. As long as the personal domains are contiguous, it’s fine if the rest of the territory in the realms is scattered about. Indeed, it’s probably more realistic!

In the Borderlands, each Legate (Count) has around 3,950 peasant families in his realm, 725 peasant families in his personal domain, and 110 urban families in his urban settlement. That leaves [3,950 – (725 + 110)] 3,115 families in the domains of his vassals. At 185 peasant families per hex, that means each Legate’s County occupies about (3,115 / 185) = 17 hexes.

Add that to the Legate’s personal domain and it’s 21 hexes per Legature (County). Most of the Legatures are contiguous but not all – a few of the Legates’ personal domains are so hemmed in by inhospitable terrain that the rest of their Legature is some distance away.

We left all of the named forests and swamps uninhabited. The unnamed northwest of the Krysivor we assumed was inhabited, presumably by woodsmen, trappers, and fisherman on the coast. The unnamed forest near Samos we left outside the Prefecture of the Borderlands entirely; it’s often a good place to drop an elven fastness if your players create elven characters local to the area.

We counted the small chunks of land in Lake Laman as full hexes for purposes of realm size because of the rule in ***ACKS II***that allows littoral hexes to have higher population densities (p. XX), and allocated them accordingly.

![](data:image/png;base64...)

### F. Demarcate the Territory of the Duchies

This step is easy: Just draw a border around the territory of each Duchy that encompasses the Duke’s personal domain and each of the Counties that make up his realm. If the Duke’s realm isn’t contiguous, that’s fine – you can use colors or symbols to differentiate which Duke owns which territory.

In the Borderlands, the Palatinates (Duchies) are contiguous, with the Palatinate of Menicos in the northeast, the Palatinate of Türos Orn southwest of Menicos, the Palatinate of Samos in the west, and the Palatinate of Siadanos in the southeast.

### G. Demarcate the Territory of the Principality

Draw a border around the territory of the entire Principality, including the Prince’s personal domain and each of the Duchies that make up his realm. Again, if it’s not contiguous, that’s fine! If you’re using map software, you can use this stage to make a political map of the Principality that shows the Duchies in contrasting colors.

In the Borderlands map below, we’ve illustrated Cyfaraun in red, Samos in orange, Siadanos in purple, Türos Orn in green, and Menicos in blue. The areas colored in grey are realms friendly to the Prefecture of the Borderlands but outside of its borders. The uncolored areas are outside the territory of demi-human or human realms.

![](data:image/png;base64...)

## Step 9: Classify Domains

Now it’s time to classify the territory of the domains as either **civilized**, **borderlands**,or **outlands**. P. XX of the ***ACKS II Revised Rulebook***states that “Existing domains … are classified by the Judge based on the geography, history, and politics of the region. Newly established domains are classified based on their proximity to urban settlements. A newly-established domain is classified as civilized if all of its territory is within 48 miles of a city or large town. A newly established domain is classified as borderlands if all of its territory is within 72 miles of a city or large town. All other newly established domains are classified as outlands. Territories that are not part of any domain at all are **unsettled**, even if they are in proximity to a city or large town. Domains can change their classification during play as cities rise and fall and population grows and shrinks.

Being within 48 miles of a city or large town always makes a domain civilized, even if it’s just established, but it’s not the only way to make a domain civilized because domains can change their classification over time. Likewise, being within 72 miles of a city or large town always makes a domain at least borderlands, but it’s not the only way for a domain to be borderlands. Apart from those two conditions, it’s entirely up to you to decide which territory counts as civilized, borderlands, or outlands. For instance, you could decide that a particular territory is civilized because there used to be a city nearby, even if the city has declined into a small town. Therefore:

* Mark all domains within 48 miles of your sandbox’s capital city as civilized.
* Mark all domains that are within 72 miles of your sandbox’s capital city as either civilized or borderlands.
* Mark all other domains as either civilized, borderlands, or outlands.
* Mark all territory outside of the domains as unsettled unless there is an “off-map” realm that is influencing or controlling that territory.

On the Borderlands map, we use white to indicate civilized territory, light grey to indicate borderlands territory, dark grey to indicate outlands territory, and red to indicate wildlands. We classified Siadanos and Menicos as borderlands even though they are not within 72 miles of Cyfaraun. What was our justification? Siadanos was once a large elven city, and the region around it had long been purged of dangerous monsters. With the Auran takeover, it has lapsed from civilized into borderlands. Menicos, meanwhile, we decided was within 72 miles of an off-table city to the northeast. The Lusaun Forest, Viamir Marshes, and Viaspen Forest are all classified as unsettled wildlands despite being “within” the Principality because they are uninhabited and untamed lands.

![](data:image/png;base64...)

## Step 10: Assign Troops Garrisons

Now it’s time to calculate the garrison the sandbox. Since you already know the population of each domain and the domain classification of all its territory, this is a simple process. For the personal domains of the Prince, Dukes, and Counts, follow these steps:

* Assign each civilized domain a garrison worth at least 2gp per family.
* Assign each borderlands domain a garrison worth at least 3gp per family.
* Assign each outlands domain a garrison worth at least 4gp per family.

There are other troops that you need to account for, however – the troops that garrison the various Baronies and Viscounties that lie within the borders of the Counties. For these, you can calculate the size of their domains by subtracting the population of the Count’s personal domain from the Count’s County. Then assign gp per family according to the rations above. These garrisons will be available to your Counts when they issue Call to Arms duties.

You can now allocate the garrison gp towards troops appropriate to your sandbox. (It’s not strictly necessary at this time but if you don’t be sure to write down all these values for later use.) If you’re the sort who enjoys building armies in wargames, break out your favorite spreadsheet and play with different ratios of troops. Try to get within 1-2% of the garrison expense. (You’ll hardly ever be able to get an exact match.).

Here’s how we did for the Borderlands. Since the area is supposed to be an important bulwark against the Waste, we assigned a garrison of 2gp for every urban family; 3gp per peasant family in Cyfaraun; and 4gp per peasant family for every other ruler. That results in the following;

* The Prefect, with 7,500 peasant families and 2,550 urban families, has a garrison of 27,600gp.
* Each Palatine, with around 1,250 peasant families and 550 urban families, has a garrison of 6,100gp.
* Each Legate, with around 725 peasant families and 110 urban families, has a garrison of 3,120gp.
* Each Legate’s Legature has around 3,825 families, of which 725 are the Legate’s personal domain and the other 3,100 are peasant families. That means that the Legates can call on another 12,400gp worth of troops, for a total of 3,120 + 12,400 = 15,320gp.
* Since there are 5 Legatures in each Palatinate, each Palatine can call on a total of [6,100gp + (5 x 15,320gp)] = 82,710gp. With 4 Palatinates in the Prefecture, the Prefect can call on a total of [27,600gp + (4 x 82,710gp) 358,440gp.

The table below reveals how we turned these numbers into the army presented in ***AX3: Capital of the Borderlands***.

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Realm** | **Garrison GP** | **Vet. Cataph.**  **Cavalry (87gp)** | **Cataphract**  **Cavalry (75gp)** | **Horse**  **Archers (45gp)** | **Composite**  **Bowmen (18gp)** | **Vet. Heavy**  **Infantry (24gp)** | **Heavy**  **Infantry (12gp)** | **Actual**  **Expense** |
| **Prefecture** | 358,440gp | 62,640gp  720 troops | 54,000gp  720 troops | 70,200gp  1,560 troops | 48,240gp  2,680 troops | 67,560gp  2,815 troops | 64,320gp  5,360 troops | 366,960gp |
| **Prefect’s Domain** | 27,600gp | 5,220gp  60 troops | 4,500gp  60 troops | 5,400gp  120 troops | 2,520gp  140 troops | 6,600gp  275 troops | 3,360gp  280 troops | 27,600gp |
| **Palatinate** | 82,710gp | 14,355gp  165 troops | 12,375gp  165 troops | 16,200gp  360 troops | 11,430gp  635 troops | 15,240gp  635 troops | 15,240gp  1,270 troops | 84,840gp |
| **Palatine’s Domain** | 6,100gp | 1,305gp  15 troops | 1,125gp  15 troops | 1,350gp  30 troops | 630gp  35 troops | 840gp  35 troops | 840gp  70 troops | 6,090gp |
| **Legature** | 15,320gp | 2,610gp  30 troops | 2,250gp  30 troops | 2,970gp  66 troops | 2,160gp  120 troops | 2,880gp  120 troops | 2,880gp  240 troops | 15,750gp |
| **Legate’s Domain** | 3,120gp | 522gp  6 troops | 450gp  6 troops | 810gp  18 troops | 360gp  20 troops | 480gp  20 troops | 480gp  40 troops | 3,102gp |

Note that the number of troops adds up by the ratio of the Legatures to Palatinates to Prefectures. For instance, with 15 cataphract cavalry per Palatinate, 5 Legatures per Palatinate, and 30 cataphract cavalry per Legature, each Palatinate has [15 + (5 x 30)] = 165 cataphracts. Note also that the number of veterans (3,535) is around 25% of the total number of troops (13,990).

**Designer’s Note:** Remember that the garrison costs represents the minimum garrison required to keep the peace in domains without morale problems. A domain might have many more troops if it is engaged in war or strategically important. For instance, to secure the border against the forces of chaos reliably over the decades, the Auran Empire used to supplement the Borderland’s garrisons with troops from the heartland of the Empire. Those troops are gone now fighting the Skysos, which conveniently allowed us to present a realm with the rules-appropriate number of troops!

## Step 11: Determine NPC Classes and Levels

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Class Level** | **Fighters** | **Crusaders** | **Thieves** | **Mages** | **Explorers** | **Venturers** |
| **0** | 33% | 15% | 15% | 10% | 16% | 10% |
| 1 | 27% | 20% | 20% | 10% | 13% | 10% |
| 2 | 27% | 20% | 20% | 10% | 13% | 10% |
| 3 | 27% | 20% | 20% | 10% | 13% | 10% |
| 4 | 27% | 20% | 20% | 10% | 13% | 10% |
| 5 | 22% | 20% | 20% | 18% | 11% | 10% |
| 6 | 23% | 20% | 20% | 15% | 12% | 10% |
| 7 | 23% | 20% | 20% | 15% | 12% | 10% |
| 8 | 23% | 20% | 20% | 15% | 12% | 10% |
| 9 | 23% | 20% | 20% | 15% | 12% | 10% |
| 10 | 17% | 20% | 20% | 25% | 8% | 10% |
| 11 | 17% | 20% | 20% | 25% | 8% | 10% |
| 12 | 17% | 20% | 20% | 25% | 8% | 10% |
| 13 | 17% | 20% | 20% | 25% | 8% | 10% |
| 14 | 17% | 20% | 20% | 25% | 8% | 10% |

## Step 12: Name the Realms and Domains

Now that you’ve developed the realms on your regional map, it’s time to name the realms and assign titles to their rulers! The Titles of Nobility table in ***ACKS II******Revised Rulebook***(p. XX) can be a useful tool for this purpose.

The method and nature by which you name your realms and titles will depend on the specifics of your campaign setting. You can give as much or as little thought to it as you want. Names don’t have any practical effect on gameplay but do shape your world’s “feel.” For instance, if you name a realm “The Republic of Pennsyltucky” and it’s led by “Lord Humungous III” your players will assume that your setting is either a post-apocalyptic United States or a gonzo world with silly names.

The Borderlands is part of my Auran Empire campaign setting and follows the naming conventions I used in developing the overall tone of the world. Generally, I draw on lesser-known historical names drawn from Antiquity and then to convert them into Classical Auran or one of the other languages in the setting. For instance, the country of Tirenea was named after the Italian region of Tyrrhenia, famous for piracy. It was also an allusion to the word “tyranny.” I converted it into the Classical Auran for “crown land.” I thought that appropriate because Tirenea is an ersatz Italy with a strong navy that dominates the region. The title of the leader of Tirenea is Tarkaun, which was a play on the Greek word *archon*, the Mongol word *khan*, and the Star Wars character Grand Moff Tarkin. In Classical Auran, it means “eagle” or, literally translated “big-bird.” Since the crown of Tirenea is gold, there is a deeply embedded Sesame Street joke at the heart of my setting. Make of this what you will.

## Step 13: Update Player Reference Guide

With your realms named and tabulated, it’s time to update your player reference guide to include the new information you’ve added. All that’s generally required is to include the name of whichever realm(s) the adventurers are likely to hail from or adventure within, with perhaps a sentence or two about them.

You can go into more detail if you wish, but many players won’t read it and the effort is often wasted. While this can be annoying to Judges that thrive on world-building, it’s wise to remember that in the real world most people cannot identify the location of major landmarks (“where is the Great Wall of China located?”) nor the chronology of historical events (“when did the War of 1812 take place?”), so having the adventurers be equally clueless about the game world is actually highly simulative.

# Chapter 7: Settlements

By the time you’ve finished constructing the realm, you’ll have placed settlements at many locations on the map. In Step 7E of Chapter 5, you’ll have selected one of these settlements as your party’s starting point. We recommended either a stronghold close to your largest low-level dungeon, or your region’s largest city. Either way, the next step is to construct this settlement. (The details of the other settlements can be worked out later, when the need requires.)

The population, demand modifiers, and ruler of the starting city should have already been selected in previous steps, but now you must flesh these out into a description of the city.

## Step 1. Determine Settlement Size and Shape

The first step in constructing a settlement is to gauge how large it is. Pre-modern cities have typically had population densities ranging from around 50 to around 300 people per acre (10 to 60 *ACKS* families per acre). Larger cities tended to be more densely populated, with metropolises such as Alexandria and Rome having 500,000 and 1,000,000 people spread over 2,040 and 3,200 acres, yielding population densities of 245 and 311 people per acre respectively. On the other hand, a rich coastal city like Pompei had just 12,000 people over 160 acres, yielding a population density of only 75 people per acre. Regardless of their density, however, all of the cities tended to be constructed in one of three basic shapes:

* Circular/Radial: Built around a central point, such as a major temple or citadel.
* Linear: Built around central axis, such as a river, coast, or major road.
* Rectangular/Oval: Built around a grid of streets forming blocks.

**Designer’s Note:** The book ***Fractal Cities*** by Michael Batty and Paul Longley is an excellent source of insight and illustration into the size, shape, and development of cities.

The Settlement Size table below shows the expected families per acre, acres, and square footage for each type of settlement. Square footage is then used to suggest dimensions for settlements of different shapes. These are merely examples and not prescriptions – any given settlement could be less or more densely populated than the averages shown here.

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Urban Settlement (families)** | **Families/Acre** | **Acres** | **Approx. SF** | **Circular** | **Linear** | **Rectangular** |

To spare you the effort of taking out your ruler and measuring, the city of Cyfaraun has a population of 2,550 families spread over 83 acres. The city walls enclose an area approximately 2,400’ long and 1,600’ wide. Here at Autarch, we eat our own dogfood!

## Step 2: Map the Settlement

Now it’s time to map your settlement. You can either find a map of an existing city (historical or fantastical) and “re-purpose” it to serve as your settlement; randomly generate a settlement using one of the many online tools; or draw the map yourself. Because building styles can vary widely, there are no fixed rules about how many buildings to have on your map. Some historical cities, such as Rome, organized the inhabitants into multi-story apartment buildings that would not have been out of place in a modern metropolis. Others, such as medieval London, consisted of densely-packed one- or two-story homes and shops. You’ll want to place somewhere between 3 buildings per 5 families to 5 buildings per 3 families, depending on the architecture.

However, there are a number of points of interest that are valuable for gameplay that we recommend for most starting settlements:

* A barracks for the army, city watch, legion, or other military force that guards the city
* A bathhouse, bawdyhouse, cantina, inn, and/or taverns where adventurers can learn rumors and spend gold like the wastrels they are.
* A dock, harbor district, or other maritime hub, if the settlement is on a river bank or shoreline.
* An emporium, bazaar, forum, or plaza where adventurers can purchase equipment and merchandise
* A merchant’s guildhouse, bank, or other chamber of commerce where investing and lending can occur
* A mercenary’s guildhouse where adventurers can find work and hire mercenaries or henchmen
* A municipal building such as a palace, city hall, and/or court for the seat of government
* A temple where prayerful casters and worshippers congregate
* A thieves’ quarter for the local criminal syndicate where assassins, thieves, and other unsavory sorts find work
* A tower of knowledge, wizard’s college, or other place of learning where studious casters come together

The number and grandeur of these points of interest will vary with the size of your settlement. For instance, in ***AX1 Sinister Stone of Sakkara****,* the settlement is just a village of 110 families. Its “academy” is a small chapterhouse building attached to the prefect’s fort, where one mid-level and a few low-level mages assist the legate. It’s “merchant’s guildhouse” is a booth in the agora. In contrast, in ***AX3 Capital of the Borderlands****,* the “academy” is the Tower of Knowledge, with dozens of mages organized in a collegiate environment, and the merchant’s guildhouse is a large complex with a bank vault.

## Step 3. Determine Inhabitants

The inhabitants of your settlement are, of course, more important than its architecture. Is the settlement ruled by a tribune, lord mayor, sheriff, prefect, or senate? How many divine casters staff the churches, shrines, and temples of the settlement? How many thieves ply the alleys and agoras in search of ill-gotten coin?

The **Starting Settlements** tables, below, can help you construct a starting settlement that is compatible with *ACKS.* For each class of settlement (I through VI) we have provided the suggested number of NPCs of each level for each of the six core classes. If your settlement is smaller or larger than the listed size, you can scale up or scale down the number of NPCs pro rata by population.

Since most *ACKS* campaigns feature a number of campaign and racial classes in addition to the core classes, you’ll need to decide which “special” classes count as which core classes. If you’re just using the classes found in the ***ACKS II Revised Rulebook****,* then barbarians, paladins, and dwarven vaultguards count as fighters; bladedancers, dwarven craftpriests, priestesses, shamans, and witches as crusaders; assassins, bards, and elven nightblades as thieves; and warlocks, elven spellswords, Nobiran wonderworkers, and Zaharan ruinguards count as mages.

At this step, you’re not actually generating or even naming these NPCs; you’re just determining their number by class and level. When you’re ready to start generating your NPCs, you can skip ahead to **Chapter 9: Non-Player Characters** (p. XX).

As always, do not feel confined to these exact parameters. While they represent average or expected values over an entire game world, any given settlement can and should stray from the average. If your campaign concept calls for a high-level mage ruling a small settlement, or a large settlement that’s been denuded of its NPCs, or for a settlement that is “the city of wizards” or “city of thieves,” adjust the numbers as you see fit.

Once you’ve decided on the numbers, create a roster with all of these values, either on paper or in a spreadsheet. You’ll use this roster to build your settlement’s points of interest.

## Step 4. Develop the Points of Interest

In the wilderness, points of interest are opportunities to challenge monsters, find treasure, and use proficiencies and powers. In a settlement, however, points of interest are opportunities to interact with particular aspects of ***ACKS II***,such as hiring henchmen, trading in the market, purchasing spellcaster services, and so on.

The material below is intended to aid you in developing points of interest for your settlement. Not every point of interest will be appropriate for every settlement, and some might not even fit into the campaign setting at all, so don’t feel that you have to include settlement features that don’t mesh with your milieu. Conversely, don’t hesitate to add additional points of interest. Amphitheaters, public fountains, colossal statues, and more can bring your settlement alive. Our city sourcebook, ***AX3 Capital of the Borderlands****,* can be a fruitful source for further points of interest.

As you detail each of your settlement’s points of interest, allocate NPCs to them from the NPC roster you created in Step 3. You should assign some or all the members of each class to various points of interest that are relevant to them. For instance, if your settlement is a Class III small city, the Starting Settlement table suggests 98 0th level, 71 1st level, 26 2nd level, 10 3rd level, 4 4th level, 3 5th level, and 1 6th level mage, as well as a percentage chance of higher-level casters. You could assign all of these NPCs to the Tower of Knowledge in your settlement, or assign some to the Tower with others working for the local government or guilds, or simply leave it open for future choices.

You do not need to develop the inhabitants in any great detail. Most characters don’t even need to be given names. For higher-level characters, a single sentence (“Fighter 7, Neutral, Jutlandic, age 47, red hair, scar on nose, wants revenge on local beastmen”) is more than sufficient.

### Amphitheaters

Whether called amphitheaters, arenas, colosseums, circuses, or fighting pits, arenas are common throughout civilized realms. Amphitheaters can range in size from simple pits with wooden bleachers for 3,000 spectators to enormous multi-level structures capable of seating 80,000 spectators. The appropriate size of an amphitheater is based on the urban settlement’s market class and population, as shown on the Amphitheater Size table, below.

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Settlement Population** | **Market Class** | **Appropriate Amphitheater Size** |
| 75-249 | Class VI | None |
| 250-500 | Class V | None |
| 501-2,499 | Class IV | 5 seats per family |
| 2,500-4,999 | Class III | 7,500 seats plus 3 seats per family over 2,500 |
| 5,000-19,999 | Class II | 15,000 seats plus 1 per family over 5,000 |
| 20,000-100,000 | Class I | 30,000 seats plus 1 per 4 families over 20,000 |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Characteristic** | **Value / Formula** |
| No. of Seats | No less than 100 seats; no more than 100,000 seats |
| No. of Stories | 1 story plus up to 1 additional story per 20,000 seats |
| Interior Area | (No. of Seats / No. of Stories) x 2 square feet |
| Interior Height | 15 feet |
| Interior Width | 2 x (Interior Area / 3.75)0.5 feet |
| Interior Length | Interior Width x 1.2 feet |
| Exterior Area | Interior Area x 6 square feet |
| Exterior Height | No. of Stories x 35 feet |
| Exterior Width | 2 x (Exterior Area / 3.75)0.5 |
| Exterior Length | Exterior Width x 1.2 feet |
| No. of Gates | Exterior Area / 3,000 |
| Amphitheater Cost | No. of Seats x 15gp |

Amphitheaters are ellipse-shaped structures with a walled, open-air interior arena surrounded by elevated seating. The exterior and interior dimensions of an amphitheater, as well as its cost, are determined by the amphitheater’s seating capacity and stories, as shown on the Amphitheater Characteristics table, below. The cost of the amphitheater includes all the necessary subterranean vaults and passages, arena and spectator gates, and so on.

Complete rules for gladiatorial games in the amphitheater can be found in ***AXIOMS*** *4*.

### Avenues and Alleys

Some settlements have twisting roads that track through ancient hills and wind along the curving course of nearby rivers. Others are have broad avenues organized into a grid by the central planners who built it. For game purposes, we divide streets into two types, **avenues** and **alleys**.

#### Avenues

Avenues are thoroughfares, usually paved with carefully-fitted flag stones, that establish city blocks. They measure 15’ wide, with a slightly concave shape. 5’-wide concrete sidewalks are raised 18” (1.5’) above the road surface on either side, the height serving to prevent vehicles from accidentally rolling into nearby pedestrians. Walkways, made by embedding 18”-tall stepping stones in the road surface, connect the sidewalks on either side at intersections. The stepping stones are separated by wheel ruts that allow carts and wagons to pass through the walkways, if they roll slowly and carefully – effectively creating a speed limit. Carts and wagons are forbidden on the sidewalks, except at the hours of sunrise and sunset, when merchants can load, unload, set up, and tear down. Patricians who don’t wish to walk on the sidewalks with the rabble often travel on litters carried by strong-backed servants.

#### Alleyways

Alleyways cut through city blocks, forming tributaries of foot traffic that flow between tightly-packed buildings and into the streets. The alleyways are often paved with concrete, but might be hard packed. They are always very narrow: Most are about 5’ wide, with the narrowest measuring just 2’6” and the widest 8’. Short-cutting through alleyways can quicken a trip, but the alleyways of a large settlement can be quite dangerous, especially at night.

### Docks

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Dock Moorage Capacity** | | |
| **Market Class** | **Moorage Capacity (st)** |
| Class I | 660,000\* |
| Class II | 165,000 |
| Class III | 85,000 |
| Class IV | 20,000 |
| Class V | 8,000 |
| Class VI | 3,000 |
| \*Per 20,000 families | | |

If your settlement is built on a riverbank or shoreline, it will usually include a dock for the mooring, loading, and unloading of vessels. Larger settlements might have multiple docks, each with one or more piers or wharves, along with other structures such as slipways and warehouses. The Dock Moorage Capacity table offers guidelines on the size of the dock(s) and the number of vessels that can be moored there.

### Emporium

An Emporium, also called an agora, bazaar, forum, or market is a plaza encircled by shops and stores. From sunup to sundown, a mosaic of colorful tents, covered wagons, and cart stands makes the Emporium the most crowded segment of the settlement. In general, any equipment and any common merchandise can be bought or sold in the Emporium (precious merchandise is exchanged in the Merchant Guildhouse). With a Friendly reaction roll, the artisans and merchants here can be a good source of city rumors or might offer introductions, information, and additional items.

About 25% of the master merchants in the Emporium belong to the venturer class; roll on the NPC Level table if so (p. XX). The remainder are 0-level characters with AC 0, 3 hp, ML -1, one rank of Bargaining proficiency and three ranks of Profession (merchant) or similar general proficiencies. Journeyman and apprentice merchants will lack one or more proficiencies.

### Mercenary Guildhouse

A Mercenary Guild is a consortium of sellswords licensed to provide private military services. At the Mercenary Guildhouse, able-bodied adventurers (STR 9+) can join the Guild; membership dues are 12gp, payable upon joining and annually thereafter.

The Guild primarily functions as a mutual aid society, paying out funds when members are captured, crippled, or slain. The member or his family will be paid 100gp for loss of life, 40gp for loss of freedom (ransom), 40gp for loss of an arm, 30gp for loss of a leg, 10gp for loss of an eye, and 5gp for loss of a finger, toe, or ear.

Members can also stay in the lodgings in the Guildhouse at a cost of just 1sp per night and can check for contracts posted by potential employers. Both members and non-members can post contracts to solicit and hire henchmen, mercenaries, and military specialists. Make sure you include the Mercenary Guildhouse in your story web. It’s a good idea to start with 4 to 6 hooks from the Mercenary Guildhouse leading to low-level points of interest in your setting. As the adventurers advance in level, you can have the Mercenary Guildhouse post contracts for more difficult challenges.

### Merchant Guildhouse

The Merchant Guild licenses merchants to do business, administers the settlement’s markets, brokers transactions, and provides banking services. The Merchant Guildhouse will typically be run by one of the highest-level venturers in the settlement.

#### Bank

The Guildhouse’s banking branch offers services to select clients, including storing wealth, borrowing and lending money, exchanging currency, and offering investment opportunities. Domain rulers are automatically accepted as clients. Otherwise, becoming a client of the Merchant Guild bank typically requires a Friendly reaction roll (add +1 if the applicant is a venturer and an additional +1 per rank of Bargaining). Clients receive the following benefits:

* Currency can be exchanged for a 0.25% fee.
* Funds can be loaned to the bank for 30-day terms at 0.25% interest.
* Funds can be borrowed from the bank with or without collateral. Adventuring expeditions are typically charged an interest rate of 3% per month with collateral or 9% per month without.
* Investments can be made, with opportunities ranging from safe to perilous.
* Wealth can be stored in the Guildhouse for a fee of 0.25% per month; clients with funds on deposit can withdraw it on demand and/or use bills of exchange to pay guild merchants.

The amount of funds available to borrowers, the size of the opportunities available for investment, and the amount of wealth in the guildhouse is determined by the settlement’s market class, as shown on the Merchant Guildhouse table. Banks cannot lend out more than hold in deposit (fractional reserve banking hasn’t been invented yet).

Enterprising adventurers might wish to rob the bank. It will surely be well-guarded by both mundane and magical methods, with NPCs hired from the settlement for its defense. The deposits will be a mix of gold, silver, and copper coins. 33% of the value will be in gold, 34% in silver, and 33% in copper. For instance, if the bank has 45,000gp of wealth in deposit, it will be 15,000gp; 150,000sp (worth 15,000gp); and 1,500,000cp (worth 15,000gp). If you want, you can divide the coins into lots of 1,000 and roll on the Special Treasures tables (p. XX – XX) to generate gems, jewelry, or collateral on deposit. The coins in the bank represent approximately 25% of the total coin circulating in the settlement’s economy (including the surrounding domains).

| \*Per 20,000 families | | | |

#### License Hall

The licensing office regulates the commerce within the city. Adventurers usually have little regard for the proprieties of licensing, but those who wish to set up a store with staff must pay an annual fee of 10% of earnings. Sole proprietors do not have to be licensed, but unlicensed businesses are considered disreputable and low-class.

#### Trading Hall

At the trading hall, adventurers can buy and sell loads of precious merchandise and solicit passengers and shipping contracts. (Common merchandise is typically exchanged in the Emporium, above.) Guild’s brokers can also provide for purchase and sale of goods (at 10% commission); retainer of hirelings (10% commission on 3 month’s wages); and arrangement of transportation services, including coach cabs, messengers, and ship’s passage within the Auran Empire (5% commission).

### Sewer System

Settlements of Class IV or higher are populous enough to require attention to waste management. In technologically advanced civilizations (such as the Auran Empire), sewers will run beneath the settlement. Usually these sewers are just filled with rats and filth, but sometimes they can form an entire “undercity” below the settlement with a subterranean population, or connect into catacombs, dungeons, or sunken ruins.

When present, sewers are usually accessed by 2’ x 2’ lead sluice grates typically pierce the avenues at regular intervals (typically one per block). Removing a sewer grate elsewhere can be done as a full-round action by making a successful Dungeonbashing proficiency throw. Otherwise it takes 1 turn (10 minutes) using a crowbar.

Sewers can feature large or small tunnels. Large sewer tunnels can be up to 13.5’ tall and 13.5’ wide (enough for a chariot). They have 2’ wide ledges running along either side, with sconces for torches ever 60’. Adventurers can move single file along the ledges without penalty, but any character struck while on a ledge must make a Paralysis saving throw or fall into the sewer tunnel. The smaller sewer tunnels are 7.5’ tall and wide and have no ledges.

Not surprisingly, a thick sludge of waste runs throughout sewer tunnels. The sludge does not slow exploration movement, but characters charge or run at half rate while within it. Acrobatics and Sneaking proficiency throws made by characters in sludge suffer a -2 penalty. The sludge is filled with disease-carrying decaying matter, so characters who are knocked down or otherwise fall prone in the sludge come down with a fungal infection unless they succeed on a saving throw vs. Poison +4. Characters that actually *eat* the sewer sludge are automatically infected with no saving throw.

Fungal infections become evident after 1d8 hours as white, pulpy scabs on the skin (or, if the sludge was eaten, on the tongue, lips, and mouth.) Once the scabs appear, the infected character suffers a -2 penalty to reaction rolls and a -1 penalty to surprise rolls and initiative rolls due to distracting itches. Each day thereafter, the scabs spread, and the infected character must make an additional Death saving throw. If the throw fails, the spreading infection leaves a permanent scar (treat as a “minor scar” on the Mortal Wounds table). If the throw succeeds, no scarring occurs, though the character remains infected. The infection can be cured with Healing proficiency or magic.

Sewer sludge also might carry a poisonous miasma, noticeable by the awful smell of rotten eggs. Characters exposed to the miasma must make a Death saving throw every turn or begin to suffer headaches, bleary eyes, and shortness of breath. These symptoms make the character **fatigued** until the character rests for one turn away from the sludge. Characters who shield their nose and mouth with a cloth bandana or take other simple precautions need save only once per hour and gain a +4 bonus.

### Temple

Most settlements will have one or more temples or other places of worship, such as abbeys, basilicas, cathedrals, chapels, churches, monasteries, mosques, shrines, or synagogues. If there’s only one Temple, it will usually be devoted to the settlement’s deity or pantheon of deities. In a larger settlement with a number of Temples, there might be houses of worship devoted to a number of different deities or pantheons, or even to deified heroes, venerated ancestors, or minor demigods. In some settings, establishments such as almshouses, cemeteries, courthouses, funeral homes, hospitals, and orphanages might also be dedicated to a god or gods and run by ecclesiastics of various sorts.

#### Ecclesiastics

Adventurers often visit Temples to hire divine casters to cast spells, recruit divine casters to serve as henchmen, and recruit healers to serve as specialists. Given the high lethality of ***ACKS II****,* it’s a certainty that the adventurers will seek out divine casters for *repair disfigurement and disability* or *restore life and limb*, so it’s worth spending some time with your NPC roster to flesh out the divine spellcasters in town who can offer such services.

Any henchmen or specialists recruited from a Temple count against the maximum number of henchmen and specialists that can be recruited from the settlement. It’s not that the Temple has *extra* divine casters lying around looking to become henchmen, but rather that it is the place where adventurers can go to find such persons. In the Auran Empire, 50% of divine casters will be crusaders, 25% will be bladedancers, and 25% will be priestesses; you can change the classes or vary these ratios for different settings.

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Temple – Divine Casters and Specialists for Hire** | | | | | | | |
| **Henchmen or Specialist** | **Class I** | **Class II** | **Class III** | **Class IV** | **Class V** | **Class VI** | **Wage** |
| Henchman - 0th level divine caster | 4d20 | 2d10 | 1d6 | 1d2 | 1 (70%) | 1 (30%) | 12gp/month |
| Henchman - 1st level divine caster | 1d10 | 1d2 | 1 (50%) | 1d2 | 1 (15%) | 1 (4%) | 25gp/month |
| Henchman - 2nd level divine caster | 1d6 | 1 | 1 (40%) | 1 | 1 (8%) | 1 (3%) | 50gp/month |
| Henchman - 3rd level divine caster | 1 | 1 (10%) | 1 (15%) | 1 (33%) | 1 (3%) | 1 (1%) | 100gp/month |
| Henchman - 4th level divine caster | 1 (70%) | 1 (30%) | 1 (10%) | 1 (15%) | 1 (1%) | None | 200gp/month |
| Healer | 5d10 | 2d6 | 1d6 | 1d2 | 1 (65%) | 1 (20%) | 1gp/day/patient |
| Healer — Physicker | 3d10 | 2d4 | 1d4 | 1 | 1 (40%) | 1 (15%) | 2gp/day/patient |
| Healer — Chirugeon | 1d10 | 1d3 | 1 | 1 (33%) | 1 (15%) | 1 (5%) | 4gp/day/patient |

#### Facilities

Some Temples might contain a workshop for magic research or a mortuary and embalming chamber for necromancy. The gp value of these facilities will be equal to twice the monthly wages of the members.

EXAMPLE: A Class V settlement has one Temple which is staffed by 10 0th level, 7 1st level, 3 2nd level, 1 4th level, and 1 5th level divine caster. Their monthly wage would be [ (12gp x 10) } + (25gp x 7) + (50gp x 3) + (100gp x 1) + (200gp x 1) ] = 745gp. Therefore, the Temple might have a workshop worth up to 1,490gp.

#### Treasury

A Temple will usually maintain a treasury where it stores its accumulated wealth and from which it pays its expenses. On average, the treasury will contain a gp value equal to 1d4 week’s wages for all members. This wealth will be a mix of gold, silver, copper, and special treasure, as explained under the Merchant Guildhouse entry, above. The treasury will be well-protected, with mechanical or magical locks and traps and possibly armed guards.

EXAMPLE: A Class V settlement has one Temple which is staffed by 10 0th level, 7 1st level, 3 2nd level, 1 4th level, and 1 5th level divine caster. Their monthly wage would be [ (12gp x 10) } + (25gp x 7) + (50gp x 3) + (100gp x 1) + (200gp x 1) ] = 745gp. Therefore, the Temple will have a treasury of between 186gp and 745gp.

#### Reliquary

Large and wealthy Temples might include one or more reliquaries containing magic items sacred to the faith. The number and type of magic items can be determined using the Magic Item Availability by Market Class (p. XX). Note that whatever you allocate to the Temple, you can’t allocate to the Tower of Knowledge – there’s only so many magic items to go around in town! The reliquary will be as or more well-guarded as the treasury.

### Thieves’ Quarter

The Thieves’ Quarter is the most dilapidated and crime-ridden portions of your settlement, filled with rough buildings inhabited by rough men and women. It’s always a dangerous place to loiter. Settlement encounters occur here on 5+ on 1d6 by day and 4+ on 1d6 by night, and reaction rolls in the alleyways suffer a -2 penalty. Nevertheless, this is where adventurers will need to go if they want to recruit thieves as henchmen, or hire ruffians to do hijinks.

#### Hideouts

The settlement’s thieves’ guild(s) or other criminal organization(s) typically have their hideouts located within the Thieves’ Quarter. The Starting City Criminal Guilds table can guide you in constructing criminal guilds compatible with *ACKS.*

|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Starting City Criminal Guilds** | | | | |  |
| **Market**  **Class** | **Total**  **Membership** | **Expected**  **Boss Level** | **Monthly Syndicate**  **Revenue (gp)** | **Monthly Guild**  **Revenue (gp)** | **Guild**  **Treasury (gp)** |
| Class VI | 16 | 4 | 1,500 | - |  |
| Class V | 42 | 6 | 3,350 | 4,850 | 15,000 |
| Class IV | 100 | 8 | 7,350 | 12,250 | 36,000 |
| Class III | 375 | 10 | 22,000 | 35,000 | 100,000 |
| Class II | 750 | 12 | 40,000 | 75,000 | 225,000 |
| Class I | 3,000 | 14 | 100,000 | 175,000 | 525,000 |

**Total Membership** shows the total membership of the starting city’s criminal guild(s) relative to its market class. These members will usually be drawn from the available thieves, assassins, and nightblades in the settlement (determined in Step 3). Note that as the market class increases, total membership scales up less swiftly than the total number of available thieves. For instance, a Class VI settlement will have 16 thieves and all 16 will belong to a criminal organization, but a Class I settlement will have 3,331 thieves with only 3,000 in criminal organizations; 10% will be unaffiliated or independent. Some guilds might permit fighters, venturers, or other classes to join as well as thieves, assassins, and nightblades.

**Expected Boss Level** is the expected level of the most powerful boss in the starting settlement. As always, don’t be afraid to stray from these ranges where it makes sense for your setting. It’s not impossible for a large city to have a small guild run by a low-level boss, or for a small town to have a high-level boss, it’s just unusual.

**Monthly Syndicate Revenue** is how much gold the boss’s syndicate in your settlement generates per month. **Monthly Guild Revenue** shows how much gold the boss’s criminal guild generates, factoring in syndicates run by underbosses in other cities, towns, and villages. If the starting settlement is isolated or highly independent, its syndicate may not be part of a larger guild (Judge’s discretion) and in that case only the syndicate revenue would be earned.

The table assumes that the settlement’s criminals have been consolidated into a single guild managed directly by one boss. If you want, you can split a settlement’s criminals into multiple competing or complimentary guilds. For example, a Class I metropolis might have 3 competing thieves’ guilds with 750 members each and a separate assassins’ guild of 750 members. Where this is done, highest boss level, monthly syndicate revenue, and monthly guild revenue should be based on the guild membership of each guild, rather than the market class of the settlement.

**Guild Treasure** is how much fungible wealth the guild will have on hand, usually in a well-secured and well-hidden location. This wealth will be a mix of gold, silver, copper, and special treasure, as explained under the Merchant Guildhouse entry, above. Note that thieves typically accumulate more treasure than arcane and divine casters, who spend their wealth on components and materials.

#### Other Establishments

The Thieves’ Quarter is typically home to a number of bawdyhouses, cantinas, inns, and taverns. These can be rolled up using the Dynamic Buildings tables (p. XX – XX). Most of these business establishments will either be owned by the local criminal guilds, or will be paying a share of their revenue to the guild for “protection.”

### Tower of Knowledge

The Tower of Knowledge is a building occupied by practitioners of studious magic, as well as by alchemists, engineers, sages, and other learned individuals. The name is specific to the Auran Empire setting, but many settings have similar organizations such as wizard colleges, sorcerer’s guilds, temples of magic, and so on. Of course, such institutions won’t be present in every setting, and when present may or may not have all of the features described below, depending on your campaign world.

#### Facilities

Depending on the interests of its member mages, a Tower of Knowledge might have a magical workshop, a crossbreeding laboratory, and/or a mortuary and embalming chamber. The gp value of these facilities will be equal to twice the monthly wages of the members.

#### Library

Most Towers of Knowledge will have a library where the members can conduct magic research. The library will contain one codex or scroll roll per urban family in the settlement. The average codex or scroll roll will be worth 150gp and weighs 1/2 st; hence library value will be 150gp x urban families. The arcane library will usually be divided into separate collections, with particularly rare or valuable books kept separate and available only to high-ranking members of the association.

The library might also include spell formulas for common spells known to caster’s. The highest level spell formula found in the library will be equal to 7 – settlement market class. For instance, a Class III settlement like Cyfaraun might have a library with common 1st – 4th level spells.

#### Storefront

In some settings, the Tower of Knowledge will dominate or even monopolize all arcane commerce. Such institutions will usually have a storefront of some sort where adventurers can:

* Buy miscellaneous equipment, including blank spell books, parchment, papyrus, and ink and commission the manufacture of workshop and laboratory components, subject to Equipment Availability (***ACKS II******Revised Rulebook*** p. XX).
* Hire an alchemist to identify a potion at a cost of 40gp. The identification requires one turn (10 minutes) and an Alchemy throw of 4+. If the throw succeeds, the alchemist identifies the potion correctly. If the throw fails, the potion is unidentifiable by the alchemist.
* Hire a sage to examine a common, uncommon, or rare magic item at a cost of 40gp. The identification requires one turn (10 minutes) and a Magical Engineering throw of 4+. If the throw succeeds, the sage correctly identifies the item’s function and general method of use. He cannot deduce command words or obscure methods of use, distinguish trapped or cursed items from safe ones, or assess the specific bonus or number of charges remaining in an item.
* Hire a sage to identify a very rare or legendary magic item at a cost of 40gp. The identification requires one turn (10 minutes) and a Loremastery throw of 13+. If the throw succeeds, the sage correctly identifies the item’s name, history, function, and general method of use. He cannot deduce command words or obscure methods of use, distinguish trapped or cursed items from safe ones, or assess the specific bonus or number of charges remaining in an item.
* Hire a mage to identify a magic item’s properties at a cost of 2,000gp. The identification takes 3 weeks and a Magic Research throw of 8+. The target value is increased by the level of spells in the item. If the throw succeeds, the mage identifies all of the item’s properties, including command words, curses, and charges. If the item proves to be a legendary item, or if it contains illegal, rare, or ritual magic, the mage or arcane institution might attempt to confiscate the item, or lie about its properties and offer to buy it for some low value, or claim its stolen, etc.
* Purchase arcane spellcasting services for the prices listed in the ***ACKS II******Revised Rulebook***p. XX.
* Purchase magic items from their arcane vault at 225% base cost, subject to Magic Item Transactions by Market Class (p. XX).
* Purchase special components from their arcane vault at 110% of market value.
* Purchase spell formulas for the spells in its library, at the following cost: 1st – 100gp, 2nd – 200gp, 3rd – 400gp, 4th – 1,000gp; 5th – 3,000gp; 6th – 7,000gp.
* Recruit mages to serve as henchmen and alchemists, engineers, or sages, to serve as specialists. The number of henchmen and specialists available will vary by market class as noted on the Mages and Specialists for Hire table.
* Sell magic items found, discovered, looted, or otherwise acquired to the institution for base cost or sell magic items they created independently for twice base cost, subject to Magic Item Transactions by Market Class (p. XX).
* Sell special components useful for magic research at 90% of market value.

Any henchmen or specialists recruited from the Tower of Knowledge count against the maximum number of henchmen and specialists that can be recruited from the settlement. It’s not that the Tower of Knowledge has *extra* mages lying around looking to become henchmen, but rather that it is the place where adventurers can go to find such mages. At your discretion, some or all of the mages may belong to other arcane classes.

| Sage | 1d6 | 1d2 | 1 (65%) | 1 (15%) | 1 (5%) | None | 500gp/month |

#### Treasury

A Tower of Knowledge will usually maintain a treasury where it stores its accumulated wealth and from which it pays its expenses. On average, the treasury will contain a gp value equal to 1d4 week’s wages for all members. treasury will be well-protected, with mechanical or magical locks and traps and possibly armed guards. This wealth will be a mix of gold, silver, copper, and special treasure, as explained under the Merchant Guildhouse entry, above.

#### Vault

Since mages need special components for their research, a Tower of Knowledge will typically maintain a vault containing special components. The value of special components will equal 1 week’s wages for the members. The vault might also contain magical items created, collected, or purchased by the members. The number and type of magic items can be determined using the Magic Item Transactions by Market Class (p. XX).

#### Joining the Tower of Knowledge

If you place a Tower of Knowledge (of any sort) in your settlement, the arcane spellcasters in your group will almost certainly want to join. The exact nature and requirements of “joining” will vary depending on your setting. Is it by application, like a college or guild? By invitation, like a secret society? By birth? Are there minimum level requirements? Dues?

For your reference, here are the mechanics (introduced in ***AX3: Capital of the Borderlands***) by which adventurers can join the Tower of Knowledge in the Auran Empire:

An applicant must be: (1) a citizen of the Auran Empire or sponsored by a patrician citizen; and (2) able to cast arcane spells, brew potions, or identify magic items *or* 0-level apprentices with INT 9+ seeking training. Applicants present themselves at the Grand Foyer and pay an application fee of 10gp. Each applicant is then interviewed by the Provost and the Regent after a waiting time of 1d4 weeks. During the interview, their spell books (if any) are inspected; applicants with any death or necromancy spells in their repertoire are ineligible for admission.

At the conclusion of the interview, an applicant deemed eligible must roll 2d6. Modify the roll by the applicant’s INT bonus and the level of the most powerful spell in his repertoire. Add an additional +1 for each of the following proficiency selections: Alchemy 3, Loremastery, Magical Engineering. Add an additional +1 per 10,000gp of treasure or magic items gifted to the Tower. Add +4 if the applicant has Collegiate Wizardry (meaning he was trained at the Tower of Knowledge or similar academy). If the modified result of the roll is 12+, the applicant is admitted as a member. Applicants who are rejected can re-apply when they have improved their skills.

You can assume 1st level mages with Collegiate Wizardry begin play as members. Mid- to high-level mages who have performed notable service to the Empire may be personally invited to join the Tower, bypassing the application process (Judge’s discretion).

New members swear oaths to Istreus and are thereafter awarded a rank based on their spellcasting ability (arcanist, etc.); mundane scholars are awarded the rank of resident scholar. Mages are entitled to wear collegian cassocks based on their choice of college (artifice, gold; divination, blue; enchantment, indigo; illusion, white; summoning, black; transmogrification, green; war, red). They receive a key to access the Tower and rights to use the libraries and laboratories of their rank. New members of sorcerer (7th level) rank or above are assigned a private study.

In exchange for these rights, members undertake certain duties. They must agree not to study or practice death magic and necromancy, and to hand over to the Tower any black magic formula or items they discover. They must pay a fee of 10gp per month to the Tower of Knowledge; those unable to pay the fee may work for the Tower as assistants to earn their fee. (This is typical for 0-level apprentices.) If a member develops a new magic item, spell, or automaton, a copy of the formula must be left with the Treasurer. If a member creates magic items for sale using the Tower’s facilities, or offers spellcasting services, the sale must be done at the Tower’s storefront and the profits shared 50/50 with the order. If a member creates magic items for personal use, the items must be bequeathed to the Tower upon the member’s death. The member is also expected to attend weekly sacrifices to Istreus, and to learn the various rites and rituals by which the god is venerated, but this duty is more often breached than honored.

Residents of the Auran Empire are not obligated to join the Tower of Knowledge in order to practice magic, but arcane casters outside of the Tower are typically viewed as hedge wizards or, if powerful, untrustworthy occultists.

## Step 5: Generate Dynamic Buildings

Now that you’ve detailed a few points of interest, you’re settlement is ready for use. It would be impractical to generate every one of your starting settlement’s buildings in advance. Moreover, it would be unrealistic! Cities are dynamic and everchanging and no one knows what lies down every alley. When the adventurers decide to explore your city, just follow the steps below to procedurally generate buildings to populate the city blocks.

1. Assign the building to a size category (small, medium, large, or huge).
2. Roll on the Building Type by Size table to determine the type of building.
3. Roll on the appropriate Occupant tables to determine who lives in the structure.
4. Roll 1d100 on the Building Styles tables to determine how it was built.
5. Determine treasure in the building (if necessary).

### Building Size

**Small buildings** range from 100 sf to 450 sf, averaging 250 sf (16’ x 16’). Small buildings might be cots (one-room dwellings), small shops or shophouses, storage shacks, cantinas, outhouses, small shrines, or hutches for small animals.

**Medium buildings** range from 500 sf to 1,700 sf, averaging 1,000 sf (33’ x 33’). Medium buildings are usually townhouses, medium shops or shophouses, or storage depots. A few are brothels, cantinas, or private baths. Medium buildings have a 25% chance to be sub-divided into 4 (2d3) small buildings, in which case you should roll once for Building Type by Size on the Small column. (All buildings will be of that type.)

**Large buildings** range from 1,750 sf to 3,450 sf, averaging 2,500 sf (50’ x 50’). Large buildings can be any building type except cot. Most are townhouses, villas, large shops or shophouses, manufactories, warehouses, inns, private baths, stables, or taverns. Large buildings have a 25% chance to be sub-divided into 10 (4d4) small buildings, in which case you should roll once for Building Type by Size on the Small column.

**Huge buildings** are 3,500 sf or more. Huge buildings are usually villas, manufactories, or warehouses, with a few private baths, public latrines, and temples. Huge buildings have a 25% chance to be sub-divided into 7 (2d6) medium buildings, in which case you should roll once for Building Type by Size on the Medium column.

To determine the type of building, roll 1d100 and cross-reference the result of the die with the appropriate column by size.

To avoid taking out your ruler to measure sizes, use this rule of thumb to evaluate your map: buildings you have to squint to even see are small; buildings you can see in clusters are medium; buildings you can easily see are large; and buildings that you instantly spot because they are noticeably larger than the rest of the block are huge.

### Building Type and Occupants

#### Cots and Townhouses

Cots are simple one-room dwelling places. They might be apartments in a huge building, single-story rowhouses crammed wall-to-wall, or freestanding shacks or hovels.

Townhouses are two-story multi-room dwelling places. Townhouses typically share their walls with adjacent buildings, but some are freestanding. A huge building might consist of a number of townhouses sharing a single roof, sometimes organized around a central courtyard.

Small cots have 1d4 occupants, medium cots have 2d3, medium townhouses have 2d4, and large townhouses have 2d6 occupants. The first two occupants are the owner/tenant(s); the next three are their dependents (children or elderly). Any additional residents are household servants (cooks, scullions, or maidservants) of the owner/tenants.

Roll 1d100 on the appropriate column of the Owner/Tenant by Building Type table (below) to determine the occupations of the owner/tenants. Roll on the Character Class and Character Level tables (below) for any classed occupants.

One of the owner/tenants has a 90% chance to be elsewhere by day. The other has a 50% chance. If both owner/tenants are absent, then any dependents will also be absent, unless servants are present.

#### Villas

Villas are luxurious two-story multi-room dwelling places with an interior courtyard. Villas can share one or more walls with other buildings, but many are freestanding. When freestanding, they often have paved walkways or gardens around their exteriors.

All villas have 2d4 patrician occupants. The first two patricians are the owners; the next four are their dependents (children or elderly). Any additional patrician occupants are siblings and cousins of owners. There is a 1 in 6 chance that one of the patricians is a fighter or similar classed character.

Villas also have occupants who serve and protect the patricians. Large villas have a cook, a maidservant, a scullion, and 1d3+1 household guards. Huge villas have a cook, 1d2 maidservants, 1d2 scullions, 1d3+1 household guards, and a guard captain (fighter or similar classed character). Roll on the NPC Class (Fighter) and NPC Level tables for any classed occupants.

The owners of the villa have a 75% chance each to be absent by day. The other occupants have a 25% chance to be absent.

#### Shops and Manufactories

Shops are single-story places of business open to the public. Some are workshops where artisans manufacture goods, while others are merchant’s stores which sell goods manufactured elsewhere or offer services. Roll 1d6. On 1-2, the shop is a merchant’s store. On 3-6, the shop is an artisan’s workshop.

Small stores are occupied by a single merchant (either a guild apprentice running a subsidiary or an unlicensed peddler or huckster). Medium stores are run by a guild-licensed merchant with two apprentices. Large stores are occupied by a master merchant supervising two licensed merchants and four apprentices. Roll 1d100 on the Merchant Occupation table to determine the type of merchants. Note that 1 in 4 master merchants belong to the venturer class; roll on the NPC Level table if so.

Small workshops are occupied by a single artisan (often a journeyman). Medium workshops are occupied by a master artisan supervising two journeymen and four apprentices. Large workshops are occupied by two master artisan with a staff of four journeymen and eight apprentices. Roll 1d100 on the Artisan Occupation table to determine the type of artisans.

Manufactories are huge one-story buildings where goods are manufactured by teams of artisans. Unlike shops, they are not open to the public; they sell at wholesale prices to the various dealers, merchants, and retailers in the city, and to traders for long-distance commerce. Manufactories employ 2d6 teams of master artisans with a full complement of staff supported by an additional 4d6 manual laborers. Roll 1d100 on the Artisan Occupation table to determine the type of artisans.

Shops and manufactories are always occupied by day. At night, the shop or manufactory will be locked and barred and the workers at home.

**Doing Business in Shops:** If appropriate to their occupation, merchants and artisans will sell armor, weapons, clothing, equipment, mounts, vehicles, etc. Small shops have equipment available equal to 10% the equipment availability of Cyfaraun (see Equipment Availability by Market Class in ***ACKS II******Revised Rulebook***). Medium shops have equipment availability at 25% overall equipment availability, and large shops have equipment availability at 50% overall. If adventurers achieve friendly (12+) reactions with merchants and artisans, they might directly buy or sell merchandise in bulk, bypassing the mercantile interests at the Guildhouse. The Merchant Occupation and Artisan Occupation tables shows what type of merchandise (if any) the merchant or artisan is interested in. Each master artisan or master merchant can buy or sell the base amount of merchandise for his market each day. An independent guild-licensed merchant can buy or sell half the base amount of merchandise per month. Transactions with individual merchants friendly to the adventurer do not count against the adventurer’s market impact.

EXAMPLE: The adventurers enter a medium shop in a Class III settlement. The Judge rolls a 2 on 1d6, so the shop is a merchant’s store. It is occupied by a guild-licensed merchant with two apprentices. He rolls 1d100 on the Merchant Occupation table and gets a 45, so the merchant is a furrier. In addition to selling various fur capes, cloaks, and garments, the furrier might transact in common furs (12 st per day), monster parts (4 st per day) or rare furs (3 st per day) with adventurers if they achieve friendly reactions.

#### Shophouses

**Shophouses** are one- or two-story establishments with a place of business on the first floor and a dwelling on the second floor. Small shophouses have a small shop with a cramped backroom or loft above the workspace. Medium shophouses have a medium shop with a second-story apartment accessed by stairs from a back room. Large shophouses have a large shop on the first floor and a townhouse on the second. Shop staff is as for shops.

Roll 1d6. On 1-2, the shop is a merchant’s store. On 3-6, the shop is an artisan’s workshop. Shophouse staff will be as Shop, above. In addition to the workers, a small shophouse has 1d3 additional occupants, a medium shophouse has 2d4-1 additional occupants, and a large shophouse has 2d6-1 additional occupants. The first four additional occupants are spouses or dependents of the workers. Any additional occupants are household servants.

Shophouses are always occupied by day. At night, the shop will be locked and barred but the owner and any family will still be present.

#### Depots

Depots are buildings used to store goods. A small depot is a storage shack, usually owned by a resident. A medium depot is a large storage unit owned by a nearby business. Large and huge depots are warehouses for the goods that the city’s residents eat, wear, and work with. Depots that contain grain or other goods spoiled by moisture are typically two stories tall, with lofts to keep the merchandise high and dry. Depots that contain wine or other merchandise ruined by heat have sunken floors where amphorae can be kept cool. Huge warehouses might have both.

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Depot Merchandise** | | | |
| **Depot**  **Size** | **Number of**  **Merch Types** | **Merchandise** | **Depot**  **Workers** |
| Small | 1 | 2d4! x 200gp | 1 (5%) |
| Medium | 1 | 2d4! x 400gp | 1d6 (5%) |
| Large | 1d4 | 2d4! x 600gp | 1d6 (10%) |
| Huge | 1d8 | 2d4! x 800gp | 2d6 (10%) |

The value of the merchandise in a depot will vary based on the warehouse’s size. The merchandise may be all of one type, or of up to eight different types. You should determine the specific merchandise based on the settlement’s demand modifiers. During the day, depot workers may be present, loading or unloading cargo, as indicated on the table. At night, depots with precious merchandise will be protected by one guard per 3,000gp of precious merchandise (rounded up) with one 3rd level sergeant per 10 guards (rounded down).

#### Bawdyhouses

Bawdyhousesare places of business where prostitutes offer their services. Even where prostitution is legal, it is not usually very respectable, and most bawdyhouses are run by or under the “protection” of a criminal syndicate. Both men and women work the bawdyhouses, offering virtually any salacious experience a discerning patron might desire. Prostitutes range from impoverished to wealthy, depending on their beauty, upbringing, and skills. In the average bawdyhouse, a few moments of pleasure costs 2sp, while a night of pleasure costs 1gp. Prices can be 10 times as much in upscale establishments catering to patricians.

Small bawdyhouses are one-room dwellings occupied by a single prostitute. Medium bawdyhouses are bordellos with several rooms, occupied by 2d3 prostitutes and run by a brothelkeeper. Large bawdyhouses are multi-story brothels run by a brothelkeeper with 1d6 1st level thieves or assassins for security and 4d6 prostitutes offering a variety of services in numerous private rooms. The brothelkeeper will be a thief or related sub-class – roll on the NPC Class and NPC Level tables. There will be one patron per two prostitutes (50% chance of one patron in a small bawdyhouse). The occupation of any patrons can be generated randomly on the General/Street column of the Building Occupants by Type table.

#### Cantinas

Cantinasare grab-and-go eateries popular with urban workers. A typical cantina has a countertop pierced with numerous recesses, each containing insulated pottery jars filled with ready-to-eat food and drink. Behind the countertop, the owner or cook works a stovetop where pots and pans simmer with food. Large cantinas may have dining tables for sit-down meals but medium and small cantinas just have stools at the countertop or no seating at all.

Here’s a typical menu for a cantina in the Auran Empire campaign setting:

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Item** | **Cost** | **Item** | **Cost** |
| Bran bread loaf (1lb) | 1cp | Boiled greens with fish sauce | 1cp |
| Wheat biscuit with honey | 1cp | Pickled beets | 2cp |
| Wheat toast with salt, olives, and fish sauce | 2cp | Boiled lentils with almonds | 3cp |
| Wheat toast with cheese, onions, and ham | 2cp | Dried figs with honey | 3cp |
| Wheat meal porridge, one bowl | 3cp | Vinegar and water | 1cp |
| Pair of hardboiled eggs with fish sauce | 1cp | Barley water and honey | 1cp |
| Pair of fried eggs with salt and pepper | 1cp | Fermented wheat porridge | 1cp |
| Blood sausage with egg, onion, and pepper (4oz) | 2cp | Milk and honey | 2cp |
| Fresh-cooked spicy pork sausage (4oz) | 3cp | Watered local wine | 2cp |
| Fried pork sausage with field mushrooms | 2cp | Warm spiced Krysean wine | 5cp |
| Salted chickpea pancakes | 3cp | Honeyed Tirenean wine | 1sp |

A small cantina is serviced by a cantinakeeper in front, with a loft or backroom affording a residence for 1d3 additional occupants. There will be 1d3 patrons during mealtimes. A medium cantina is serviced by a cantinakeeper and will feature a second-story apartment with 2d4-1 additional occupants. There will be 2d6 patrons during mealtimes. A large cantina is serviced by a cantinakeeper and scullion, with 4d6 patrons during mealtime. A second-story townhouse will contain an additional 2d4+1 occupants. The first four additional occupants are the spouse and dependents of the cantinakeeper. Any additional occupants are household servants (cook, scullion, and maidservants).

#### Taverns

Taverns are one-story establishments that serve made-to-order meals alongside beer, wine, or both. A tavern might include gambling facilities (sometimes in a basement or backroom) as well as private rooms for sexual services. A tavern will be occupied by a tavernkeeper, a cook, a scullion, 1d3 tavernworkers, and 2d6+2 patrons. Taverns do not offer lodging or stables, but there will be a backroom or loft for the tavernkeeper’s 1d4 dependents. If the tavern is in the thieves’ quarter, there might be 1d2 footpads and 1d2 thugs providing security, and 1d4 prostitutes plying the crowd. The basement of a tavern can make a good hideout for a criminal guild. Here’s a typical menu for a tavern in the Auran Empire campaign setting, with higher-end food than a cantina:

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Food** | **Cost** | **Drinks** | **Cost** |
| Wheat biscuit with honey | 1cp | Vinegar and water | 1cp |
| Boiled green beans in fish sauce | 1cp | Krysean barley beer and honey | 2cp |
| Boiled lentils with almonds | 2cp | Opelenean plum wine mixed with rose water | 5cp |
| Pickled beets | 2cp | Corcanosi raisin wine mixed with honey | 5cp |
| Pickled olives and capers | 2cp | Tirenean sweet sparkling rose wine mixed with honey | 1sp |
| Fried cucumbers drizzled with honey | 2cp | Tirenean dry white wine mixed with honey | 1sp |
| Blood sausage with egg, onion, and pepper | 2cp | Tirenean sweet white wine mixed with honey and rose petals | 2sp |
| Pork stew with apples and honey | 3cp | Tirenean dry white wine with wormwood and saffron | 5sp |
| Fried mullet fish with olive oil and lemon | 5cp | Tirenean sweet white wine with pepper, saffron and cinnamon | 5sp |
| Roast mutton with chopped almonds and garlic | 1sp | Argollëan honeyed ambrosia with saffron and cinnamon | 5sp |

Most taverns will offer live entertainment at night; roll on The Tavern Entertainment table each evening that adventurers visit. Some entertainment might even draw additional patrons. Each entertainer has a 25% chance to be a 1st level bard.

#### Inns

Innsare two-story establishments that offer meals like a tavern along with lodging for guests. A typical inn is organized around a tavern on the first story, occupied by the innkeeper, 1 cook, 1 scullion, 1d3 tavernworkers, 1d3 maidservants, and 2d6+2 patrons. On the second floor there will be lodging for the innkeeper and his 1d4 family members (spouse and dependents), plus rooms for guests. Stalls for 2d4 mounts will be available in the rear. 1d4x25% of the rooms and stalls will be vacant. 1d4 private rooms and 1d2 common rooms might be available on any given night.

#### Bathhouses

Bathhousesafford wealthy patrons the opportunity to bath away from the (literally) unwashed masses who descend upon the city’s Public Baths. Medium bathhouses have one story consisting of an atrium/changing room, a cold-water bath, and a warm lounge, with 1d4-1 patrons in each room, and one bath attendant in the atrium. Large private baths add a hot plunge bath and a dry sauna. Large baths will have 1d4+1 patrons in each room, 1d3 attendants in the warm lounge, and 1 attendant in the atrium. Huge private baths add a garden, gymnasium, latrine, or library. They have 1d4+4 patrons in each room, 1d4+4 attendants in the warm lounge, and 1 attendant in the atrium.

Reaction rolls with patrons of the bathhouses are at +1 due to their collegial atmosphere. The cost of using the bathhouse is kept low (2cp) to promote public hygiene.

#### Public Latrines

Public latrinesare one-story establishments. A small public latrine is simply an outhouse with a seat that opens onto the sewers below. 50% have an occupant at any time. Large and huge public latrines feature one or more rows of seats built over sewer line. A moat in front of the seats is furnished with sponges on sticks, with which patrons can wipe themselves. Large latrines will have 2d6 patrons, while huge will have 5d6. Reaction rolls in the latrine suffer a -2 penalty, as no one likes being bothered on the toilet.

#### Shrines

Shrines are one-story private places of worship or veneration of the dead erected by the settlement’s patrician or wealthy merchants. Small shrines usually commemorate an exalted ancestor or family line but might also be dedicated to a god in a particular aspect. For instance, a small shrine on Gambler’s Row might be dedicated to Calefa in her aspect as goddess of fortune. Small shrines have a single caretaker (roll on the Minor Ecclesiastic Occupation table) who cares for its idols and symbols by day. There is a 25% chance that 1d4 worshippers are present.

Huge shrines are dedicated to a particular god or even an entire pantheon. Huge shrines have a cleric or priestess as caretaker (roll on the NPC Class and NPC Level tables to determine sub-class and level) with 1d4 assistants (roll on the Minor Ecclesiastic Occupation table for each). There is a 75% chance that 3d6 worshippers are present.

#### Stables/Pens

Stables/pensare dwellings for domestic animals. Several different types of animals live in small stables/pens. Roll 1d8 or choose: On 1-3, it’s a coop with 6d10 chickens. On 4, it’s a kennel with 1d6 dogs. On 5, it’s a sty with 1d6 pigs. On 6, it’s a hutch with 4d10 rabbits. On a 7, it’s a shed with 2d6 goats. On an 8, it’s a stable with 1d3 donkeys. By day there is a 50% chance of one laborer at the pen.

Large stables/pens contain a mix of draft and riding animals. At any time, there will be a total of 2d6 donkeys, 1d8 mules, 1d6 medium draft or riding horses, 1d4 heavy draft horses, and 1d2 light riding horses, as well as a stablehand who grooms, feeds, and washes them. During daylight hours, an additional 1d4 stablehands will be present.

### Building Occupant Tables

As noted above, some types of buildings always have particular types of occupants. For instance, villas are always owned by patricians, and inns are always owned by innkeepers. These occupants are summarized in the Standard Occupants by Building Type table.

Other types of buildings have random occupants. You can use the Random Occupant by Building Type table to randomly determine the occupation, class, and level (if any) of such buildings. For Artisans, roll on the Artisan Occupation table. For merchants, roll on the Merchant Occupation table. For other building occupants roll on the appropriate column of the Random Occupant by Building Type table. (Use the General/Street column for encounters on the streets, baths, or other public places where adventurers might run into just about anyone.)

Roll on sub-tables as directed. Never roll on the Random Building Occupant tables for dependent occupants. Dependents (children, disabled family members, elders, or spouses devoted to domestic duties) are just that.

Some table results directly indicate a classed NPC. These represent characters who practice their class full-time. Other table results indicated there is a percentage chance the character of that occupation belongs to a particular character class. These represent individuals who either are retired from their class or who primarily pursue another occupation instead of their class.

(Note that relative to the total number of classed individuals, there are more full-time clerics and mages than full-time fighters and thieves. There are, nevertheless, many more fighters and thieves than clerics and mages. It’s just that many fighters and thieves are found running inns, working as marshals, etc.)

When a classed character appears, roll on the NPC Level sub-table to determine their specific level unless a level is already noted. If the class is listed as fighter, mage, crusader, or thief, you can either roll on the NPC Class sub-table for a sub-class or assume it is the default.

For more information about NPCs, see **Chapter 9: Non-Player Characters** (p. XX).

### Building Treasure

Adventurers might decide to burglarize a building. Buildings contain coin equal to 1.5 x the wages of the non-dependent occupants. Itinerant occupants (such as bathhouse patrons) carry coin equal to their wages/20. Coin will be in the ratio 1:10:100 gold : copper : silver. Shops and manufactories also contain goods with value of equal to 1d6x earnings. The remainder of the occupants’ wealth is in building, land, fixtures, tools, personal items, etc.

EXAMPLE: A medium workshop is staffed by a master gemcutter (80gp per month), two journeymen (20gp per month) and four apprentices (10gp per month), for total earnings of 160gp per month. The gemcutter’s workshop contains 240gp in coin and 1d6x240gp in merchandise. The Judge rolls a 5, so the workshop has 1,200gp in uncut and freshly-cut gems.

## Step 6. Build Settlement Story Web

It’s time now to re-open the story web you created back in Step 7D of **Chapter 5**: **Settings**. Review the strands of your web to see if any of the points of interest in your sandbox can be linked back to your settlement. If you’ve taken our advice and chosen a starting settlement that is close to one of your low-level dungeons, you’ll want to create a number of strands that lead from the settlement to that dungeon. If you’ve included a dungeon or sewer in your settlement, make sure there are strands that lead from some of the settlement’s other points of interest into those adventure sites.

## Step 7: Update Settlement Encounter tables

The last step in creating your settlement is to update the settlement random encounter tables (p. XX) to reflect the particularities of your setting. For an example of how to do this in practice, compare the table in this book to the encounter table in our city sourcebook, ***AX3 Capital of the Borderlands.*** When you compare the ***JJ*** table to the ***AX3***table, you’ll note two major differences:

First, on the ***JJ***table, rolls of 89-100 trigger encounters. On the ***AX3***table, rolls of 89-100 direct you to re-roll on a sub-table which is specific to the district in which the encounter takes place. This trick allows us to avoid having to create entirely separate encounter tables for different boroughs or neighborhoods. One table covers “generic” encounters for the settlement as a whole, while the sub-tables offer unique encounters that occurred only in specific neighborhoods.

Second, on the ***JJ***table, each encounter entry is kept somewhat nonspecific. For instance, entry 01-04 states that “adventurers who bribe or drive off the City Watch receive 1d4 rumors and a pledge of aid from the beggars in the future.” On the ***AX3***table, each encounter is specific to the story web of Cyfaraun. Entry 01-04 states that “adventurers who bribe or drive off the City Watch will be invited to meet their friends at the Vagrant Colony (#73u).” The Vagrant Colony is a point of interest in Cyfaraun that is linked to a death cult in the city, whose existence is hinted at in ***AX3***encounters 49-52 and 105-108.

By undertaking a similar effort for your settlement, you can integrate the random encounters into the settlement story web, and reduce the need for improvisation during play, and generally increase verisimilitude. That said, this step is completely optional. You can easily run settlement adventures using the standard encounter table. Depending on the focus of your campaign, investing time here might not be worthwhile.

# Chapter 8: Dungeons

During the course of constructing his campaign’s starting region, you’ll have placed about 30 different dungeons of varying size on the regional map for your sandbox. Don’t feel obliged to create all the dungeons yourself! In fact, doing so is an enormous time sink. The most experienced Judges generally gather dozens of adventures, lairs, and encounters from magazines, websites, and commercial products and adapt them to their setting, focusing on personally creating just a few special areas.

The following sections outline how to create a dungeon, and different considerations to keep things interesting.

## Step 1: Select Dungeon Size

First, you must decide the size of the dungeon you are creating. In Chapter 5, we defined the following dungeon size:

* A **megadungeon** has hundreds of rooms spread across a number of levels.
* A **large dungeon** has 60 to 120 rooms spread across one to three levels.
* A **standard dungeon** has 15 to 25 rooms spread across one or two levels.
* A **small dungeon** has 2 to 10 rooms, usually on one level.
* A **lair** might range from a den in a tree to a village but it is characterized by featuring one type of monster in its native habitat.

If you’ve taken our advice on constructing your sandbox, your setting will have 3 large dungeons, 14 to 20 standard dungeons, and 9 to 13 small dungeons or lairs. If this is the first *ACKS* dungeon you’re creating, we recommend a single-level standard dungeon with about 25 rooms. That’s enough size to get a “feel” for the system without it being overwhelming. Maps of this size are also readily available online if you want to avoid having to try your hand at cartography.

## Step 2: Select Dungeon Type

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Roll** | **Dungeon Type** | **Roll** | **Dungeon Type** |
| **1** | Abandoned mine | **11** | Natural caverns |
| **2** | Barrow mound | **12** | Prison |
| **3** | Catacombs | **13** | Ruined villa |
| **4** | Cliff city | **14** | Sewers |
| **5** | Crumbling castle | **15** | Temple |
| **6** | Giant burrow | **16** | Tomb |
| **7** | Giant insect hive | **17** | Tower |
| **8** | Humanoid warren | **18** | Treetop settlement |
| **9** | Lost city | **19** | Underground vault |
| **10** | Monster lair | **20** | Wizard’s dungeon |

Next, you must choose the type of dungeon you are creating. Many dungeons are underground complexes of hallways and chambers. But dungeons can also twisting natural caverns, catacombs, tombs, crumbling towers, huge temples, unbreakable castles, ruined cities, or any other structure imaginable. To randomly determine the dungeon’s type, roll 1d20 on the Dungeon Type table.

If you are using the Auran Empire setting, Auran dungeons will often be barrow mounds, crumbling castles, prisons, ruined villas, sewers, or towers; dwarven dungeons will be abandoned mines, tombs, or underground vaults; elven ruins will be lost cities or treetop settlements; and Thrassian and Zaharan dungeons will be catacombs, cliff cities, crumbling castles, prisons, sunken cities, temples, tombs, towers, and wizard’s dungeon;

## Step 3: Map the Dungeon

After the dungeon type is determined, you have to find or draw a map for the location. Often you can find unkeyed free maps online and simply customize them to your needs. If you draw your dungeon maps, use square graph paper (or the digital equivalent thereof) . The assumed scale for *ACKS* is that each square on the graph paper equal 10’. If you are using a large play mat with grids on it for using figurines, you can draw the map at a scale of 1” equals 5’, which provides an appropriate scale for use with typical 25 mm scaled figurines. The map itself should be drawn to suit the type of dungeon, such as twisting tunnels in a cavern, endless rooms in a dank dungeon, or hallways and rooms in a ruined castle.

At the end of this chapter, we have included a number of maps from the Auran Empire setting that you can use for your campaign.

## Step 4: Stock the Dungeon

After the map for the location has been drawn, it’s time to stock the dungeon with dangerous monsters, traps, and treasure. You can choose where to place these, or roll randomly on the **Dungeon Stocking** table.

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Dungeon Stocking** | | |
| **Roll 1d20** | **Contents** | **Treasure** |
| **1-6** | Empty | 15% |
| **7-12** | Monster | If Lair |
| **13-15** | Trap | 30% |
| **16-20** | Unique | As Needed |

Roll on the Dungeon Stocking table once for each room on each level of the dungeon. Each roll can result in either an empty room, a monster encounter, a trap, or a unique dungeon feature. Record the results for each dungeon level separately. Each set of results indicates what will be found on that level of the dungeon. Then assign each result to a specific room according to the interaction between the logic of the dungeon and the nature of the result, following the guidelines below.

EXAMPLE: The Judge has mapped a single level dungeon with fifteen rooms. He rolls on the Dungeon Stocking table fifteen times. He gets four “empty” results, eight “monster” results, two “trap” results, and one “unique” result. His next step will be to place these results onto his dungeon map in a logical (or at least entertaining) manner.

## Step 5: Create Wandering Monster Tables

You’ll need a set of Wandering Monsters by Level tables both to stock your dungeon and to run it. However, you don’t necessarily need to create a new set of tables for every dungeon. You can, if you’d like, just use the default Wandering Monsters by Level tables we provided earlier in these rules (p. XX) or you can use a set of tables from another dungeon you’ve created or purchased. If you do want to create your own Wandering Monsters by Level tables, read on.

The first consideration in designing random encounter tables is providing a mix of challenges. As you’ll recall from Chapter 2, the Wandering Monsters by Level tables are sub-divided into columns by Monster Level, with 12 rows per column. This structure has been carefully tuned to provide the right mix of foes.

Entries 1-4 are for **beastmen**. Beastmen tend to band together in groups and might be negotiated with if adventurers speak their language. Their organization means that they often set up patrols and call for reinforcements, but also that their internal rivalries and feuds with outsiders can be exploited. At lower dungeon levels, giants and other humanoids replace beastmen.

Entries 5-8 are for **animals**, **vermin**, and **oozes**. Thes are creatures which are mindless or act on instinct. Such monsters fill a role in the dungeon ecology, and also provide scope for adventurers to use spells like *speak with beasts* or gambits like delaying pursuit by dropping sacks of meat.

Entries 9-11 are for **men and monsters**,who often exploit or prey upon the other monsters on the level. This category of monsters is less communal and more independent than beastmen, and more intelligent and/or more supernatural than vermin. Dealing with men and monsters allows adventurers to use their unique solutions to problems, from turning undead to avoiding a petrifying gaze.

The last entry in this category is usually reserved for **NPC parties**, who might be rival adventurers from civilized lands or potent emissaries from monstrous domains; these encounters are especially challenging because NPC parties tend to have goals, capabilities, and ruthless priorities similar to those of the player characters.

An equally important consideration in designing your random encounter tables is making sure the monsters you’ve chosen have an appropriate and varied assortment of treasure. Of course, when encountered as wandering monsters, most won’t be carrying that treasure, but since you’ll also be using these tables to stock your dungeon lairs, it pays to review the treasure types.

Fortunately, having a varied mix of monster roles tends to also ensure a good diversity in treasure. Beastmen tend to be raiders, with sizable but relatively low-level hoards extorted from weaker creatures or received in payment for serving stronger ones. Vermin often have incidental treasure, as many might be attracted to shiny objects or have an ecology that involves gathering the corpses of creatures that do carry wealth. And most hoarders organized or strong creatures powerful enough to gain and defend the highest-value, lowest-bulk treasure – occupy the men and monsters role. For further information on treasure categories, see **Random Treasure Generation** in Chapter 4.

| **Dungeon Level** | **Party Level** | **Monster XP Value** |
| 1 | 1 | 1-15 |
| 2 | 2-3 | 20-47 |
| 3 | 4-5 | 50-150 |
| 4 | 6-7 | 175-475 |
| 5 | 8-9 | 500-1,140 |
| 6 | 10+ | 1,200+ |

The last, and perhaps most important, factor in creating a wandering monster table is choosing a set of monsters whose capabilities are appropriate to the dungeon level. The Wandering Monster Table Guidelines table indicates the criteria used to design the sample encounter tables above. It is recommended that Judges creating a new table follow these guidelines for selecting most or all of its monsters. While it is certainly desirable for adventurers to face both stronger and weaker monsters, the Random Encounter by Level table consulted when rolling for each encounter will do much to ensure that this is the case. Adventurers will often do the rest, by seeking out depths too dangerous for them or slumming in the shallows which offer little challenge (and little reward). Having random tables that are appropriate to each level thus allows chance, and the equally random factor of player choice, to determine which level’s table comes into play.

## Step 6: Place Monsters

For each “monster” result obtained on the above table, you must choose or roll for a monster encounter appropriate for the dungeon level it appears on. Begin by rolling on **Dungeon Random Encounters by Level** table to determine which sub-table to consult, then consult the appropriate **Wandering Monsters by Level** table to determine the specific monster and the number appearing. You can use the tables we provided (p. XX) or the ones you created in Step 5, whichever you prefer.

EXAMPLE: The Judge obtained eight “monster” results on the Dungeon Stocking table. He decides to roll randomly to determine the specific monsters. Since this is a single level dungeon, he rolls eight times on the Dungeon Wandering Monster Level table for Dungeon Level 1. The dice indicate that seven of the monster encounters will be of Monster Level 1, and one will be of Monster Level 2. Rolling on the Monster Level 1 sub-table, his results are 8, 11, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, resulting in 4 encounters with 2d4 goblins each; 1 encounter with 1d12 morlocks; 1 encounter with 3d6 giant rats; and 1 encounter with 1d10 stirges. Rolling once on the Monster Level 2 sub-table, his result is an 8, indicating an encounter with 1d6 pit vipers.

Next, assign each monster encounter to a room in the dungeon level. Monsters generated from a lower-level table might be placed near stairs or other inter-level passages connecting them to their natural level, or surrounding the lair of an intelligent monster from the current dungeon level which employs the lower-level monsters as guards. Intelligent monsters from higher-level tables might be placed in hidden or inaccessible areas, while unintelligent powerful monsters might have a whole dungeon area to themselves, shunned by other creatures.

When placing monsters, you should consult the monster entries in the ***ACKS II******Monstrous Manual*** to determine if the monsters are in a lair. Monsters with lairs will have treasure, as detailed below in **Assigning Treasure**. For most creatures, such as giant rats or centipedes, you can simply check against the monster’s Lair characteristic to see whether the monsters have a lair in the dungeon or are just temporarily holing up. If monsters are in their lair, you can add additional encounters with the same type of monster nearby in order to scale up the number of creatures to the full lair amount, if desired.

EXAMPLE: The Judge consults the monster entries to find the Lair for giant rats (10%), striges (40%) and pit vipers (none). He rolls for Lair for the rats and stirges, and determines that the stirges are in a lair. A lair of striges can be as many as 3d12, but he decides to stick with one encounter of 1d10 striges so as not to overwhelm the dungeon with stirges.

Some types of monsters have lairs composed of a variable number of encounter groups. For example, goblins are encountered in gangs (encounter groups) of 2d4, and a goblin lair is composed of 3d6 gangs. If the stocking procedure has generated multiple encounters with a particular type of organized monster, then the dungeon should be assumed to hold a lair of that type of monster. One room in the dungeon should be chosen as the lair, and one of the monster encounters assigned to it. The other encounters rolled for that monster type should be placed nearby to form watch points, barracks, or splinter colonies. The various rooms should then be reinforced with any leaders, champions, or other creatures indicated by the monster entry. If space permits, you can also add additional groups in other nearby rooms, up to the maximum number of groups that can be encountered for a lair.

EXAMPLE: Because the Judge rolled four encounters with goblin gangs, the dungeon holds a goblin lair. The Judge chooses a remote room in the rear of the dungeon as the lair, and places one goblin gang there. Nearby he places several guard posts with the other three gangs. He adds a champion to each gang, as instructed by the monster entry. The entry also states that a lair will have a chieftain, sub-chieftain, females, and young, so he adds those creatures to the lair room.

Sometimes the stocking procedure results in only one encounter with a monster that normally lairs in organized groups. Such isolated parties will not normally have lair treasure, unless the monster entry indicates that the number of groups appearing in the lair can equal one; in this case, the lone group may be the survivors of a larger tribe, or a splinter faction absconding with a portion of their former brethren’s treasure. Otherwise, you have two options. You can roll additional groups to form a lair of the size indicated by the monster entry, or you can decide that the group on this level is simply an isolated party temporarily holing-up in the dungeon.

EXAMPLE: The Judge rolled one encounter with a gang of morlocks. Morlock lairs consist of 1d8 gangs. The Judge therefore has three options. He can choose to have these morlocks constitute a small lair of one gang; he can choose to add additional gangs; or he can decide that the morlocks are an isolated group and not part of a lair. He opts for the latter.

## Step 7: Place Traps

Traps include deadfalls, spiked pits, poisoned needles in door handles, and other obstacles intended to harm, capture, or delay dungeon explorers. A trap is defined by its location, its trigger, its level, and its effects.

### Trap Locations

When determining the location of traps, you should consider their proximity to entryways, chokepoints, key intersections, and other factors. Unless the dungeon is a “fun house” made by some mad mage, traps should be placed with a purpose, such as protecting an area, interdicting a passage, raising an alarm, and so on.

### Trap Trigger Mechanisms

When you place a trap in a dungeon, you must decide how the trap is triggered. A trap might have a magical or mechanical trigger or even a combination of both. Some examples of trap triggers are:

* *Counterweights:*A system of weights that shifts when an object is removed or added, triggering a trap, such as a dart trap or a portcullis slamming down.
* *Gear Systems:* Complex arrangements of gears that interact when a specific action is taken, such as turning a key or solving a puzzle, which in turn triggers a trap.
* *Hidden Buttons:* Small buttons hidden in plain sight or disguised as part of the scenery that, when pressed, activate a trap, such as a wall of spikes or a sudden gust of wind.
* *Levers and Pulleys:* Hidden or disguised levers that, when pulled, trigger a trap, such as a collapsing floor or a flood of water.
* *Pivoting Floor Tiles:* Tiles that rotate when stepped on, causing the character to fall into a hidden pit or releasing a hidden mechanism.
* *Pressure plates:* Plates that, when stepped on, depress and activate a connected mechanism, such as releasing a projectile or opening a hidden door.
* *Proximity Triggers:* Devices that react to the presence of heat, sound, or movement, such as a brazier that ignites a flammable gas or a chime that summons guardians.
* *Runes:* Magical symbols that trigger a trap when touched or activated by a specific action, such as casting a spell or speaking a command word.
* *Tripwires:* Thin wires or ropes stretched across a path or doorway that, when tripped over, activate a trap, such as releasing a swinging log or dropping a net.
* *Weight-Sensitive Platforms:* Platforms that activate a trap when a specific weight is applied, such as a boulder rolling down a slope or a retracting bridge.

When an adventurer takes an action that might (but not necessarily will) activate a trap, such as walking down a corridor with a tripwire, you secretly roll 1d6. On a roll of 1-2, the adventurer has accidentally activated the trap. On a roll of 3-6, the adventurer has accidentally missed the trap entirely and it remains inactivated. (You can adjust the range of success if the trap is particularly hard or easy to set off.) Depending on the location of the trigger, the party’s formation, and the vagaries of chance, you might secretly roll many times before a hapless adventurer sets off a trap! Some traps can be accidentally activated by probing with a 10’ pole; in that case the pole is treated as an adventurer moving 5’ ahead of its bearer for purposes of activation.

###### Crude Traps

Some traps are crudely constructed with simple or jury-rigged mechanisms. These function similarly to ordinary traps, but are easier to spot and less effective. All characters gain a +4 bonus to find and remove crude traps. If a crude trap triggers an attack, it attacks with a -2 penalty. If a crude trap grants a saving throw, the target saves with a +2 bonus. Once set, a crude trap must be maintained, which requires one hour’s worth of maintenance per day. If unmaintained it ceases functioning.

### Trap Level

Like dungeons and spells, traps are rated in levels (1st – 6th). The level of a trap has two meanings. First, it indicates what level of a dungeon the trap is likely to appear on. For instance, the 1st level of a dungeon typically has 1st level traps. Second, it indicates the dangerousness of the trap relative to a divine spell of the same level when cast at minimum caster level. For instance, a 3rd level trap should be approximately as dangerous as a 3rd level divine spell cast by a 5th level caster.

Magical traps can simply trigger the desired spell, but non-magical traps should approximate the effect of a spell through mechanical means – ignition of flammable gases, release of darts, and so on. The comparison to spell level is intended as a guideline to appropriate areas of effect, attack throws, saving throws, and damage for mechanical traps, not an invitation to give miraculous powers to trappers.

EXAMPLE: The Judge is placing a trap on Level 1 of a dungeon. He decides that the trap’s trigger is a pressure plate that, when stepped on, triggers a blast of burning naphtha. How powerful should the naphtha blast be? Since it’s being placed on Level 1 of a dungeon, it should be about as powerful as a 1st level arcane spell. **Fan of flames** is a 1st level spell that deals 1d4 fire damage to all creatures within a 40’ x 20’ cone, or half that on a successful Blast save. **Fireball** is a 3rd level spell that deals 5d6 damage to all creatures in a 20’ diameter, half that on a successful Blast save. His naphtha trap should do damage that’s equal to or less than the damage from **fan of flames**, not **fireball**.

### Trap Effects

Thes effects of a trap can range from damaging attacks to area effects that require a saving throw to avoid or mitigate. The traps below are examples of classic traps with common mechanisms. Do not be afraid to concoct your own fiendish traps in addition to these! The suggestions below range from 1st to 6th level. Remember that more challenging dungeons should have deadlier traps.

###### Ceiling Collapse Trap

A section of the ceiling is rigged to collapse when triggered, potentially crushing characters underneath with bricks or stones. Each creature in a 10’ radius must make a Blast saving throw. If the save fails, the creature suffers bludgeoning damage from falling bricks or stones. If the save succeeds, the creature suffers half damage.

* *1st level:* The falling stones deal 1d6 bludgeoning damage.
* *2nd level*: The falling stones deal 3d6 bludgeoning damage.
* *3rd level*: The falling stones deal 5d6 bludgeoning damage.
* *4th level*: The falling stones deal 7d6 bludgeoning damage.
* *5th level*: The falling stones deal 9d6 bludgeoning damage and knock prone any creatures that fail their saves.
* *6th level*: The falling stones deal 11d6+11 bludgeoning damage and knock prone any creatures that fail their saves.

###### Deadfall Trap

When triggered, a heavy object falls from overhead tree branches. Each creature in the area of effect must make a Blast saving throw. If the save fails, the creature suffers the listed effect. If the save succeeds, the creature dodges the deadfall.

* *1st level:* The deadfall deals 1d12 bludgeoning damage to all creatures in a 5’ diameter.
* *2nd level*: The deadfall deals 3d12 bludgeoning damage to all creatures in a 10’ diameter.
* *3rd level*: The deadfall deals 5d12 bludgeoning damage to all creatures in a 10’ diameter.
* *4th level*: The deadfall deals 7d12 bludgeoning damage to and knocks **prone** all creatures in a 10’ diameter.
* *5th level*: The deadfall deals 9d12 bludgeoning damage to and knocks **prone** all creatures in a 10’ diameter.
* *6th level*: The deadfall instantly kills all creatures in a 10’ line.

###### Excavated Earth Pit Trap

A 10’ x 10’ hole in the ground is covered with leaves and brush rigged to collapse when triggered by someone walking across it. Creatures on top of the pit when it is triggered fall in, suffering 1d6 bludgeoning damage per 10’. If the pit is spiked, creatures that fall into it are also impaled on 1d4 spikes dealing 1d6 damage each.

* *1st level:* The pit is 10’ deep.
* *2nd level*: The pit is 20’ deep
* *3rd level*: The pit is 10’ deep with spikes.
* *4th level*: The pit is 20’ deep with spikes.
* *5th level:* The pit is 30’ deep with spikes.
* *6th level:* The pit is 40’ deep with spikes.

###### Fire Trap

A hidden canister contains a volume of flammable substance. When triggered, a valve on the canister is opened and the substance is ignited and ejected onto one or more creatures or an area of effect.

* *1st level:* Flammable oil is sprayed over a 10’ diameter area of floor and ignited. Each creature in the area of effect must make a Blast saving throw. If the save fails, the creature takes 1d8 fire damage immediately and an additional 1d8 fire damage on the following round. If the save succeeds, the creatures 1d4 fire damage.
* *2nd level:* Naphtha is projected in a 40’ long and 20’ wide cone. Each creature in the area of effect must make a Blast saving throw. If the save fails, the creature takes 2d4 fire damage. If the save succeeds, the creature takes half that damage.
* *3rd level:* Flammable gas in a 20’ diameter sphere is ignited. Each creature in the area of effect must make a Blast saving throw. If the save fails, the creature takes 5d6 fire damage. If the save succeeds, the creature takes half that damage.
* *4th level:* Flammable gas in a 20’ diameter sphere is ignited. Each creature in the area of effect must make a Blast saving throw. If the save fails, the creature takes 7d6+7 fire damage. If the save succeeds, the creature takes half that damage.
* *5th level:* Sticky flammable gas in a 20’ diameter sphere is ignited. Each creature in the area of effect must make a Blast saving throw. If the save fails, the creatures takes 9d6 fire damage and starts **burning** (as per the spell *kindle flame*).
* *6th level:* Magma pours over a 5’ diameter sphere. The creature in the area of effect must make a Death saving throw. If the save fails, the creature is disintegrated.

###### Missile Trap

An arbalest, ballista, bow, crossbow, or dart-thrower in a hidden location is rigged to fire at a target point when triggered. The missile can be magical or poisoned.

* *1st level:* A crossbow fires one bolt, attacking as a 1st level fighter and dealing 1d6+1 piercing damage.
* *2nd level:* A battery of crossbows fires three bolts, each attacking as a 3rd level fighter and each dealing 1d6+1 piercing damage.
* *3rd level:* A ballista fires one bolt, attacking as a 5th level fighter. If it hits, the target suffers 3d6 piercing damage. If it misses, the bolt scatters to a new target. Thereafter each creature within a 5’ line of the target struck must make Blast saves. If the save fails, the creatures suffer 3d6 piercing damage. If the save succeeds, the creature suffers half that.
* 4th *level:* A crossbow fires one poisoned bolt, attacking as a 7th level fighter for 1d6+1 piercing damage. If the creature is damaged, it must succeed on a Death saving throw or die in 1 turn.
* *5th level:* A battery of arbalests fires nine bolts, each attacking as a 9th level fighter and each dealing 1d10 piercing damage.
* *6h level:* A battery of ballista fires three bolts, each attacking as an 11th level fighter (as per the 3rd level trap).

###### Needle Trap

A needle launcher in a hidden compartment is rigged to eject one or more needles when triggered. The needle can be poisoned.

* *1st level*: A needle attacks the triggering creature as a 1st level fighter for 1 piercing damage. It is poisoned with cobra venom. If the creature is damaged, it must succeed on a Death save at +2 or suffer 1d6 poisonous damage.
* *2nd level*: A needle attacks the triggering creature as a 3rd level fighter for 1 piercing damage. It is poisoned with wyvern venom. If the creature is damaged, it must succeed on a Death save at +1 or suffer 6d6 poisonous damage after 1 round.
* *3rd level*: A needle attacks the triggering creature as a 5th level fighter for 1 piercing damage. It is poisoned with wyvern venom. If the creature is damaged, it must succeed on a Death save at +1 or suffer 6d6 poisonous damage after 1 round.
* *4th level*: A needle attacks the triggering creature as a 7th level fighter for 1 piercing damage. It is poisoned with black worm venom. If the creature is damaged, it must succeed on a Death save or die instantly.
* *5th level*: A pair of needles each attack the triggering creature as a 9th level fighter for 1 piercing damage each. The needles are poisoned with dragon blood venom. If the creature is damaged by a needle, it must succeed on a Death save or die instantly. If damaged by both needles, the creature must succeed on a Death save at -4 or die instantly.
* *6th level*: A black hepatizon needle attacks the triggering creature as an 11th level fighter for 1 magical piercing damage. The needle is cursed with black magic to slowly sap life energy over a duration of 10 rounds. If the creature is damaged by the needle, it must make a Death save each round at the start of its initiative until the duration elapses. Each time the save fails, the creature instantly loses 1d8 points from its maximum hp. If the creature fails the save even once, it becomes **enervated** at the end of the duration. For purposes of removing the curse, consider it a 6th level spell cast by an 11th level caster.

###### Portcullis Trap

A portcullis is hidden above an entryway. When triggered, the portcullis falls suddenly downward. The creature who triggered the trap must make a Blast saving throw. If the save succeeds, the creature can choose on which side of the portcullis it lands. If the save fails, you choose on which side of the portcullis it lands and might apply other effects.

* *1st level:* If the save fails, the creature also suffers 1d6 piercing damage.
* *2nd level:* If the save fails, the creature also suffers 3d6 piercing damage.
* *3rd level:* If the save fails, the creature also suffers 5d6 piercing damage and is knocked **prone**. In addition, it gets **stuck** in the portcullis as if it had failed to progress through a chokepoint (***ACKS II*** *RR,* p. XX).
* *4th level:* If the save fails, the creature also suffers 7d6 piercing damage and is knocked **prone** and gets **stuck**. If the save succeeds, the creature suffers half that damage and is knocked prone.
* *5th level:* If the save fails, the creature also suffers 9d6 piercing damage and is knocked **prone** and is **stuck**. If the save succeeds, the creature suffers half that damage and is knocked prone.
* *6th level:* If the save fails, the creature suffers 11d6 piercing damage and must immediately roll on the Piercing Mortal Woundstable and suffer the result listed under Permanent Wounds Suffered. When rolling on the table, the only modifiers that apply are those from CON and HD.

###### Rock-Cut Pit Trap

A 10’ x 10’ smooth-hewn pit is cut into the rock and concealed by a rug or floorboard that gives way when trod upon. Alternatively a pressure sensitive trap door, with or without locking mechanism, can trigger the trap when an appropriate weight is on top. Creatures on top of the pit when it is triggered fall in, suffering 1d6 bludgeoning damage per 10’. If the pit is spiked, creatures that fall into it are also impaled on 1d4 spikes dealing 1d6 damage each.

* *1st level:* The pit is 10’ deep.
* *2nd level*: The pit is 20’ deep
* *3rd level*: The pit is 10’ deep with spikes.
* *4th level*: The pit is 20’ deep with spikes.
* *5th level:* The pit is 30’ deep with spikes.
* *6th level:* The pit is 40’ deep with spikes.

###### Rolling Rock Trap

A massive boulder is set to roll down a slope or chute when triggered, crushing anything in its path. Each creature in the boulder’s path must make a Blast saving throw. If the save fails, the creature takes bludgeoning damage and is knocked **prone**.

* *1st level:* A 5’ wide boulder deals 1d6 bludgeoning damage to creatures in its 30’ long path.
* *2nd level*: A 10’ wide boulder deals 2d6 bludgeoning damage to creatures in its 30’ long path.

* *5th level*: A 10’ wide boulder deals 6d6 bludgeoning damage to creatures in its 45’ long path.
* *6th level*: A 10’ wide boulder deals 8d6 bludgeoning damage to creatures in its 45’ long path.

###### Scything Blade Trap

A scything blade is hidden in a secret compartment in a ceiling or wall. When triggered, the blade swings out in a 10’ line, slicing anything in its path. Each creature in the area of effect must make a Blast saving throw. If the save fails, the creature suffers slashing damage and/or other effects.

* *1st level:* Affected creatures suffer 1d8 slashing damage as the blade swings out.
* *2nd level:* Affected creatures suffer 3d8 slashing damage as the blade swings out.
* *3rd level:* Affected creatures suffer 5d8 slashing damage as the blade swings out.
* *4th level:* Affected creatures suffer 5d8 slashing damage as the blade swings out. All creatures in the area must then succeed on a second Blast saving throw or suffer 5d8 slashing damage as the scythe swings back.
* *5th level:* Affected creatures suffer 7d8 slashing damage as the blade swings out. All creatures in the area must then succeed on a second Blast saving throw or suffer 7d8 slashing damage as the scythe swings back.
* *6th level:* Affected creatures suffer 7d8 slashing damage and must immediately roll on the Slashing Mortal Woundstable and suffer the result listed under Permanent Wounds Suffered. When rolling on the table, the only modifiers that apply are those from CON and HD.

###### Spring Snare Trap

A snare is connected to a taut branch overhead. When triggered, the snare fastens around the legs of creatures in the snare’s area of effect. Each creature in the area of effect must make Paralysis saving throw. If the save succeeds, the creature avoids the trap. If the save fails, the creature suffers bludgeoning damage, is hoisted into the air, and becomes **restrained** until he escapes or cuts free. When a creature escapes or cuts free, it falls to the ground unless protective measures are taken, suffering an additional 1d6 bludgeoning damage per 10’ of fall.

* *1st level:* The trap targets a 5’ diameter area, deals 1d6 bludgeoning damage, and hoists the affected creatures 10’ up.
* *2nd level*:The trap targets a 10’ diameter area, deals 2d6 bludgeoning damage, and hoists the affected creatures 20’ up.
* *3rd level*: The trap targets a 20’ diameter area, deals 3d6 bludgeoning damage, and hoists the affected creatures 30’ up.
* *4th level*: The trap targets a 20’ diameter area, deals 4d6 bludgeoning damage, and hoists the affected creatures 40’ up.
* *5th level*: The trap targets a 20’ diameter area, deals 5d6 bludgeoning damage, and hoists the affected creatures 50’ up.
* *6th level*: The trap targets a 25’ diameter area, deals 5d6 bludgeoning damage, and hoists the affected creatures 50’ up.

###### Swinging Log Trap

A large log is hidden above an entryway or passage. When triggered (usually be tripwire), the log swings down, smashing anything in its pass. Each creature in a 10’ line must make a Blast saving throw. If the save fails, the creature suffers bludgeoning damage and/or other effects.

* *1st level:* Affected creatures suffer 1d8 bludgeoning damage.
* *2nd level:* Affected creatures suffer 3d8 bludgeoning damage and are knocked **prone**.
* *3rd level:* Affected creatures suffer 5d8 bludgeoning damage and are knocked **prone**.
* *4th level:* Affected creatures suffer 5d8 bludgeoning damage and are knocked **prone** and forced back by 1’ per damage dealt. If this knocks a creature into a wall, it takes an additional 1d6 bludgeoning damage per full 10’ traveled.
* *5th level:* Affected creatures suffer 7d8 bludgeoning damage and are knocked **prone** and forced back by 1’ per damage dealt. If this knocks a creature into a wall, it takes an additional 1d6 bludgeoning damage per full 10’ traveled,
* *6th level:* Affected creatures suffer 9d8 bludgeoning damage and are knocked prone and forced back by 1’ per damage dealt. If this knocks a creature into a wall, it takes an additional 1d6 bludgeoning damage per full 10’ traveled. In addition, affected creatures are **stunned** until the end of their next initiative.

###### Whipping Branch Trap

A tree branch with spikes or thorns is pulled taut. When triggered, the branch swings out to whip anything in its pass.

*1st level:* The branch attacks the triggering creature as a 1st level fighter for 1d6+1 piercing damage.

* *1st level*:The branch attacks the triggering creature as a 1st level fighter for 1d6+1 piercing damage.

* *5th level:* The branch attacks the triggering creature as a 9th level fighter for 5d6+5 piercing damage. The thorns are poisoned with wyvern venom. If the creature is damaged, it must make a Death save at +1 or suffer 6d6 poisonous damage after 1 turn.
* *6th level:* The branch attacks the triggering creature as a 9th level fighter for 5d6+5 piercing damage. The thorns are poisoned with dragon blood. If the creature is damaged, it must make a Death save or die instantly.

## Step 8: Place Unique Encounters

Unique encounters are special encounters or special areas that stand out from encounters in most other rooms, such as talking statues, pits with slides down to other rooms or dungeon levels, magical illusions, scrying pools, teleporting doorways, and mysterious fountains whose water confers beneficial or baleful effects. You should think out each unique encounter carefully. The special effects of unique encounters might be known to some of the dungeon inhabitants and used for their own ends. One reward of figuring out the trick of a unique encounter could be that adventurers can likewise benefit, for example by sending charmed creatures through a teleporter to cause havoc, using a slide to gain access to a hidden area of the dungeon, or evading pursuit by hiding behind an illusory wall.

Not all unique rooms involve monsters, but some do. You can select from a variety of monsters which are well suited for creating tricks and surprises. The **Unique Monsters** table lists monsters appropriate for unique rooms on each level. Some of these creatures, like zombies, skeletons, golems, and animated statues, can be plausibly employed to power mechanisms like elevator cages and roundabouts, as well as acting as guardians for those who might interfere with their workings. Enchanted monsters like cacodemons, elementals, genies, manes, and invisible stalkers are frequently bound to a room with instructions to perform some task, the purpose of which may have long since become meaningless. Those who can free them from this servitude may gain great rewards. Deceptive monsters such as doppelgangers, murder maggots, oozes, and shrieking fungi may create tricky situations by acting on their own initiative, for example by infesting what appears to be a haul of treasure and merchandise or taking up residence in a seemingly empty room. Those who construct dungeons may also find these creatures useful in preparing a surprise for intruders. A pit trap is an ordinary dungeon stocking result, but a pit trap filled with a mustard mold is deserving of the “unique” appellation.

| **Unique Monsters** | |
| **Dungeon Level** | **Monsters** |
| 1 | Murder maggot, spitting cobra, shrieking fungus, venous sentinel, skeleton, zombie |

## Step 9: Assign Treasure

After you’ve placed all the monsters, traps, and unique features in the dungeon, it’s time to assign treasure to the various rooms.

Monsters will have treasure if they are in their lair. Empty and trap rooms will have treasure 15% and 30% of the time respectively. If treasure is present, the treasure should be determined based on the Treasure Type of the monster encountered, or from the Unprotected Treasure table for treasures that appear in conjunction with empty or trap rooms.

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Unprotected Treasure** | | | | | |  |
|  | **1d6 Roll for Treasure Type** | | | | |  |
| **Dungeon Level** | **1** | **2** | **3** | **4** | **5** | **6** |
| 1 | A | B | C | D | E | F |
| 2 | C | D | E | F | G | H |
| 3 | E | F | G | H | I | J |
| 4 | G | H | I | J | K | L |
| 5 | I | J | K | L | M | N |
| 6 | M | N | O | P | Q | R |

Treasure placed in monster lairs should make sense in the context of the monster. For instance, an owl beast’s treasure might be just a pile of loose coin and goods intermixed with the bones of past victims, while a goblin band’s treasure might be kept in a locked chest hidden by the goblin chief, with the key kept on his person.

When unprotected treasure is indicated in a room, it should seldom be lying about and easily seen. Generally, this kind of treasure has been hidden, possibly by monsters or NPCs who may or may not still be present and aware of its location. The treasure will usually be buried, hidden in a secret recess, or otherwise disguised, and you should place it in rooms with these features.

Treasure placed in rooms with traps could be hidden, or it could be placed on the corpses of previous victims of the trap. This paradoxically alerts characters to the danger posed by the trap while encouraging them to get close enough to its hazards to loot the corpses of those who were not thus alerted, or thought they would be able to avoid its effects.

Treasure should be placed in rooms with unique encounters as needed. Sometimes this will be necessary to round out the ratio of wealth to experience points on the level, as described below. An obvious treasure may also be needed to tempt adventurers into engaging with a room’s unique feature. Always suspecting a trick of some kind, dungeon explorers are typically wary of stepping into rooms with lifelike statuary, checkerboard floors, or arcane glyphs. Placing treasure on the other side of such hazards may encourage further exploration, especially if the treasure is not an obvious lure which raises suspicion in its own right.

As a final stage of treasure placement, you should sum up the treasure placed on the level and compare it to the total number of experience points available from monsters on the level. The ideal ratio is 4gp worth of treasure for every 1 XP from monsters. The random monster charts are designed to yield this result on average, but as the action of probability does not always yield average results, you might need to adjust the result. When too little treasure appears, you might wish to remove some monsters or add more treasure; doing the opposite will help address an overbalance that produces too much treasure. More details are provided in Chapter 4, **Planned Treasure Generation**.

## Step 10: Review for Verisimilitude

Some *ACKS* Judges prefer to create dungeons where the ordinary laws of nature are suspended. Sometimes called “funhouses,” “gonzo dungeons,” or “mythic underworlds,” dungeons of this ilk simply ignore questions such as “what do the monsters eat,” “who resets the traps,” and “how did the creatures get here” in order to provide an unpredictable and flavorful play experience. Other *ACKS* Judges prefer to create naturalistic dungeons – desolate, ruined, occupied by monsters, but still governed by the laws of nature. Both approaches can work, but the second approach requires an additional step in the dungeon design process, a review for verisimilitude.

If you’re creating a gonzo dungeon where the extraordinary is everywhere, skip this step. If you’re creating a naturalistic dungeon, here are the questions you should ask yourself as you review it for verisimilitude:

* Why has the dungeon not already been explored by other adventurers?
* Why are the monsters in the dungeon?
* How did the monsters get into the dungeon?
* What do the monsters eat and drink and where do they excrete?
* Why is there treasure in the dungeon?
* If there are perishable items in any of the treasures, why haven’t they perished?
* Who, if anyone, re-sets the traps in the dungeon?

We’ll use ***AX1: Sinister Stone of Sakkara***as an example of a review for verisimilitude. In ***AX1****,* the dungeon has not already been explored because it has been sealed under a dome of rock for thousands of years, and has only recently become accessible due to an earthquake. Most of the monsters are in the dungeon because they have been draw their by the emanations of the eponymous Sinister Stone; others are undead that have been there for millennia, or abominations created by the stone. The newly-arrived monsters got into the dungeon via it’s only entrance, near the crack in the dome. The monsters frequently raid the surrounding forest and countryside for food and treasure. The treasures in the dungeon include perishable items only if they belong to the newly-arrived monsters, while the older and hidden treasures are non-perishable coin, gems, etc. The monstrous inhabitants of the dungeon re-set its traps.

## Step 11: Finish the Dungeon Design

You should take care to describe rooms and passageways as they fit the environment. How do areas smell? What do they look like? What creatures live here, and what evidence do they leave behind? You should add enough description to keep players interested in the dungeon, but should not go so far that the description is too deep and becomes tiresome.

One option is to fully describe only a small proportion of the rooms in a dungeon. These rooms would include rooms with special or unique encounters. The remaining rooms, while they may have monsters and treasure, can be similar to one another in description. Unimportant random details can be made up during actual game play. However, anything significant which is made up on the spot must be written down to maintain consistency if the characters return to the same room.

In addition, a multi-level dungeon used for extensive play should be considered a “living” place. You should keep track of how the player characters alter the environment, and how resident monsters may change in number, type, or behavior in response. A mega-dungeon will evolve through time just as the characters will by adventuring there.

# Chapter 9: Non-Player Characters

In the course of running an ***ACKS II***campaign, you will assume the role of countless **non-player characters**. Such NPCs will include the various patrons and rulers who hire the adventurers; the henchmen, mercenaries, and specialists hired by the adventurers; the antagonists and rivals fought by the adventures; and of course the hard-working commoners, drunken boors, crusty tavern keepers, and other ordinary sorts that they encounter in your campaign world.

## Demographics of Leveled NPCs

The vast majority of NPCs are 0th level characters. A small minority are leveled characters of 1st level and above. Levelled characters become increasingly rare with each level after 1st. The exact frequency at which leveled characters appear in a population depends on the nature of the civilization to which the population belongs. The Demographics of Leveled NPCs tables, below, show the frequencies at which leveled characters occur for civilized human realms, demi-human realms, and barbarian realms.

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Demographics of Leveled NPCs in Human Realm** | | |

| 13 | 1 in 4,750,000 | Kingdom |
| 14 | 1 in 13,000,000 | Empire |

|  |  |  |

| **Demographics of Leveled NPCs in Demi-human Realm** | | |
| **Level** | **Frequency** | **Possible Realm** |

|  |  |  |

| **Demographics of Leveled NPC in Barbarian Clanhold** | | |
| **Level** | **Frequency** | **Possible Realm** |
| 1 | 1 in 15 | Extended Family |
| 2 | 1 in 25 | Extended Family |
| 3 | 1 in 40 | Extended Family |

| 13 | 1 in 265,000 | Barbarian Kingdom |
| 14 | 1 in 550,000 | Barbarian High Kingdom |

Civilized human realms have the lowest proportion of leveled characters. The crushing reality of agricultural economics leaves only a small elite available to study war, magic, and theology. Only 1 in 40 inhabitants of, e.g., the Auran Empire is 1st level. There are only 2 adults per 5 inhabitants, so 1 in 16 (6.25%) of human adults is 1st level.

Demi-human realms have a higher proportion of leveled characters. Demi-humans have longer lifespans than humans, which offers more opportunity for members of their races to gain levels. They also face more frequent incursions from beastmen raiders. Therefore, 1 in 20 inhabitants of a typical elven fastness or dwarven vault, or 1 in 8 adults (12.5%) of demi-human adults is 1st level.

Clanholds and nomad hordes, of the sort found in Ulruk, Jutland, and Skysostan, have the highest proportion of leveled characters. 1 in 15 inhabitants, or 1 in 6 adults (16.7%) of tribal and nomad realms are 1st level. Fortunately for the inhabitants of civilized realms, clanholds and nomad hordes tend to have much lower population densities, so the higher frequency of leveled characters does not necessarily overwhelm the number in civilized realms.

We strongly encourage you to use these demographics to guide the number of leveled NPCs you place in your *ACKS* campaigns. Everything from the personal authority of leaders, the GP thresholds for campaign XP, and the expected wealth of characters by level is attuned to these demographics.

That said, the Demographics of Leveled Characters should not be treated like a straitjacket on your creativity. If your campaign calls for a demographically-unlikely number of powerful mages in a particular city, so be it. Just be aware of the implications!

### Leveled NPCs of Aurëpos

The table below provides the frequency by class and level of leveled characters within the population of Aurëpos, home of the Auran Empire. Aurëpos has a population of 66,067,940 people. You can adapt these values to your own campaign by simply multiplying the number appearing by the population of your continent or region divided by the population of Aurëpos.

### NPC Rulers of Aurëpos

This table presents the number of rulers of each title; the average families governed by each title of ruler; the average income per month of each title of ruler; the average tithe paid of each title of ruler; and the average garrison expenditure per month of each title of ruler in Aurëpos. The average garrison is then multiplied by the number of rulers to determine the total garrison of all Aurëpos. We assume that the average troop earns 25gp. These metrics feed into ruler entourages (p. XX)

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Ruler**  **Title** | **No. of**  **Rulers** | **Average**  **Families** | **Average**  **Income** | **Average**  **Tithe** | **Average**  **Garrison Cost** | **Total**  **Garrison Cost** |
| Emperor | 1 | 112,500 | 911,172 | 112,500 | 225,000 | 225,000 |
| King | 11 | 34,156 | 214,294 | 34,156 | 78,820 | 867,020 |
| Prince | 47 | 12,771 | 88,414 | 12,771 | 30,954 | 1,454,834 |
| Duke | 224 | 2,583 | 22,655 | 2,583 | 6,726 | 1,499,934 |
| Count | 1,178 | 963 | 8,444 | 963 | 2,433 | 2,866,157 |
| Viscounty | 6,324 | 346 | 2,831 | 346 | 859 | 5,435,411 |
| Baron | 32,665 | 154 | 656 | 154 | 332 | 10,836,453 |
| **Total of Total:** | | | | | | 23,184,809 |
| **Total No. of Troops:** | | | | | | 927,392 |

The following table shows the level of experience of the rulers of each title. Note that the levels of rulers are skewed towards the higher level range for each title, because rulers tend to accumulate XP (income – GP threshold) until they stop leveling. Some of the rulers will have advanced to a higher level and be actively seeking to expand their domains in order to advance in power.

You can adapt these values to your own campaign by simply multiplying the number appearing by the population of your continent or region divided by the population of Aurëpos.

### NPC Military Commanders of Aurëpos

Knowing the total number of troops in Aurëpos (927,392) allows us to work out the number of brigades, battalions, companies, and platoons that exist on the continent. We assume troops are 80% infantry and 20% cavalry, and that they are organized into units of the sizes presented in ***ACKS II******Revised Rulebook***and ***Domains at War***. Each commander is assumed to be able to command 4 units, although in practice many commanders can control many more than that. Each lieutenant can lead 1 unit.

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  | **Realm**  **Troops** | **Infantry**  **Only** | **Cavalry**  **Only** | **Total**  **Units** | **Commanders**  **Required** | **Lieutenants**  **Required** |
|  |  | 927,392 | 741,914 | 185,478 | -- | -- | - |
| Number of Brigades | | | 386 | 193 | 580 | 145 | 580 |
| Number of Battalions | | | 1,546 | 773 | 2,318 | 580 | 2,318 |
| Number of Companies | | | 6,183 | 3,091 | 9,274 | 2,318 | 9,274 |
| Number of Platoons | | | 24,730 | 12,365 | 37,096 | 9,274 | 37,096 |

These numbers are then used to calculate the available leaders for the troops of the realm. The table below shows the number of commanders required to command the units; the number of NPCs eligible to hold those commands; the number of lieutenants required to lead the units; and the number of NPCs eligible to hold those lieutenancies; and the percentage of the requirement that can be met.

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Unit**  **Size** | **Infantry**  **Only** | **Cavalry**  **Only** | **Total**  **Units** | **Cmdrs.**  **Required** | **Cmdrs.**  **Level Require.** | **Eligible**  **Cmdrs.** |  | **Excess**  **Cmdrs.** | **Lieut.**  **Required** | **Lieut.**  **Level Req.** | **Eligible**  **Lieut.** | **Lieut.**  **%%** |
| Brigades | 386 | 193 | 580 | 145 | 10 | 245 |  | 100 | 580 | 9 | 137 | 24% |
| Battalions | 1,546 | 773 | 2,318 | 580 | 8 | 933 |  | 353 | 2,318 | 7 | 635 | 28% |
| Companies | 6,183 | 3,091 | 9,274 | 2,318 | 6 | 4,976 |  | 2,658 | 9,274 | 5 | 4,298 | 46% |
| Platoons | 24,730 | 12,365 | 37,096 | 9,274 | 4 | 25,591 |  | 16,317 | 37,096 | 3 | 25,026 | 67% |

You can use these metrics as benchmarks when developing and staffing the armies that guard – or threaten – your campaign’s realms. The most important fact to note is that, while there are sufficient commanders available to lead the armies of Aurëpos, there are not enough lieutenants available to staff every unit: a typical realm will simply not have a lieutenant available for every unit of each size. Moreover, lieutenants become progressively scarcer for larger units, which nicely reflects the real-world difficulty of finding competent people capable of managing large bodies of troops. In a company-sized battle, fewer than half (46%) of the units will have lieutenants, and in a huge brigade-scale battle, less than a quarter (24%) will.

### Age of Leveled NPCs

Using the XP thresholds and the mathematics for earning XP from campaign activities, we can calculate the minimum age of various NPCs if they have not undertaken adventuring or other high-risk activities. Note that these are minimums – they assume that at every step, the NPC has the resources necessary to advance. If those resources are not available, the increase in XP threshold by level will ensure they do not make progress. For instance, a tribune will never advance from 5th level, no matter how old he gets, if his domain income remains below his XP threshold.

* **Fighter/Other (noble)** includes aristocrats, nobles, and patricians with opportunities for command and rulership from a young age, either from inherited lands or a ladder of offices such as the *cursus honorum*. They accumulate XP from their rule and advance relatively quickly (though not so quickly as adventurers!). Around 7th level, they hit middle age.
* **Fighter/Other (magistrate)** represents the armigers, knights, serjeants, stewards, and other retainers of the nobility, who work as magistrates in their domains. They accumulate XP from the fee paid for their magistrature. Because they do not directly rule domains, they advance much slower. It would not be uncommon for a 40-year old 9th level prefect to have a 56-year old guard captain or steward of 7th level. Magistrates with ambitions for swifter progress often seek to become domain rulers themselves, usually at the expense of their ostensible lords.
* **Fighter/Other (commoner/enlisted)** represents the path of common enlisted troops of the realm. They are assumed to fight no more than one major battle every other year, gaining battle and spoils XP in each battle. Veteran troops (1st level characters) will generally be the survivors of 5-7 battles over 15 years. Across all troops, the average age of active-duty troops is 28, the average age of veteran soldiers is 36, and the average age of retired soldiers is 50.
* **Crusader (proselytizer)** encompasses all those divine spellcasters who peacefully advance in level by means of acquiring divine power from congregants and returning it to their patron deity. This a slow process, as the faithful are few in number. Crusaders, priestesses, and shamans who have advanced by proselytization will be almost 70 years old by the time they reach 11th level. Note that divine power alone is not sufficient to enable a crusader to reach 14th level; for this he must be a theocratic ruler!
* **Mage (researcher)** includes those arcane spellcasters who peacefully advance in level through magical research. At lower levels they work as assistants for more advanced colleagues, while at higher levels they pursue their own projects. If a mage is fortunate enough to have a steady supply of gold and special components, advancement can be relatively swift. In many cases, however, mages lack the resources they need to advance.
* **Thief (carouser)** represents the thieves, assassins, bards, and other streetwise types. They are assumed to advance in level by perpetrating petty hijinks such as carousing. As a result, they advance quite slowly. A 3rd level thief will already be middle aged and virtually none will advance past 5th level unless they become willing to take big risks, such as adventuring or dangerous hijinks.

What should be clear to you from these tables is that the vast majority of mid- to high-level NPCs in the world are middle aged or old. As such they will have already lost at least 2 points of STR, DEX, and CON, making them (relatively) weaker than comparable PCs of the same level who have advanced quicker. This helps explain both why adventurers are often called on to quests by various patrons, as well as why adventurers can, when ready, claim crowns and take thrones.

**Designer’s Note:** Because of their unpleasant complexity, we have excluded the comprehensive workbooks that were used to calculate these numbers. If you are interested in learning more about the demographic calculations of *ACKS*,you can gain access to additional information and (at some tiers) workbooks detailing the calculations on the Autarch Patreon.

### Wealth and Magic Item Availability by NPC Level

How much wealth does a typical NPC have? How many magic items? The table below shows the expected wealth and the number of magic items of each category (common, uncommon, rare, very rare, and legendary) a typical NPC of each level will have access to.

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **NPC**  **Level** | **Wealth**  **Per NPC** | **Magic Item**  **Value Per NPC** | **Common**  **(500gp)** | **Uncommon**  **(2,500gp)** | **Rare**  **(12,500gp)** | **Very Rare**  **(60,000gp)** | **Legendary**  **(300,000gp)** |
| **0** | 70 gp | 4.2036 gp | 1% | - | - | - | - |
| **1** | 770 gp | 150 gp | 30% | - | - | - | - |
| **2** | 2,310 gp | 450 gp | 90% | - | - | - | - |
| **3** | 4,620 gp | 875 gp | 1 | 15% | - | - | - |
| **4** | 9,240 gp | 1,750 gp | 1.5 | .40% | - | - | - |
| **5** | 19,200 gp | 3,500 gp | 2 | 1 | - | - | - |
| **6** | 38,640 gp | 7,000 gp | 4 | 2 | - | - | - |
| **7** | 76,800 gp | 15,250 gp | 4 | 2 | 66% | - | - |
| **8** | 153,600 gp | 28,500 gp | 5 | 3 | 1 | 10% | - |
| **9** | 346,244 gp | 65,000 gp | 5 | 3 | 2 | 50% | - |
| **10** | 505,533 gp | 97,500 gp | 5 | 5 | 3 | 75% | - |
| **11** | 1,139,969 gp | 228,500 gp | 7 | 7 | 7 | 2 | - |
| **12** | 1,774,405 gp | 349,000 gp | 8 | 7 | 7 | 4 | - |
| **13** | 4,538,039 gp | 892,500 gp | 10 | 10 | 9 | 5 | 1.5 |
| **14** | 12,982,800 gp | 2,555,000 gp | 10 | 10 | 10 | 10 | 6 |

As always, these are just guideline and you do not need to strictly adhere to them when developing your NPCs. For instance, if your campaign entails that a 1st level halfling owns a legendary magic item, so be it (that might make a suitable basis for a great campaign!). However, in most cases, those who are most powerful will have the most powerful magic items.

### Entourages of Leveled Character

One of the common questions that every *ACKS* Judge faces is deciding how much high-level help a ruler can call on. Does a 9th level duke have a mage on his payroll? What level is the chief priest of a principality ruled by a 12th level mage? To solve this problem, we first made some simplifying assumptions:

* Every ruler pays himself a wage equal to his henchman salary. He uses this wage for rent, food, drink, ordinary servants, pets, and so on.
* Every ruler allocates an amount of treasure equal to the supply cost needed to field his own fighting forces. During campaign months, these funds are used for supply troops; during other months, they might be spent on agricultural investments or stronghold construction.
* The amount of treasure available to hire an entourage of supporters is therefore equal to Domain Income – (Ruler Salary + Supply Cost).
* In addition, every ruler pays 1gp per family per month in tithes towards the local ecclesiastics. While not directly under the control of the ruler, these crusaders tend to be cooperative with and supportive of a ruler who pays his tithes and upholds the law. The amount of treasure spent on maintaining clergy is equal to the tithes paid.
* If desired, “non-cleric” funds can be spent on clerics, but not vice versa.

Since we know the number of rulers of each level, their average domain income, their salaries by level, and their domain tithes, we can work out the gp value of entourages. Note that is the maximumentourage of an averageruler. Because salary changes with level, rulers with the same title who pay themselves a higher salary will have smaller entourages and vice versa. Each ruler would, of course, choose for himself.

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Ruler**  **Level** | **Ruler**  **Title** | **Domain**  **Income** | **Ruler**  **Salary** | **Supply**  **Cost** | **Domain**  **Tithe** | **Entourage**  **(Non-Clerical)** | **Entourage**  **(Clerical)** |
| **3** | Baron | 656 | 100 | 73 | 157 | 483 | 157 |

| **6** | Viscount | 2,831 | 800 | 189 | 351 | 1,842 | 351 |
| **7** | Count | 8,444 | 1,600 | 535 | 982 | 6,309 | 982 |
| **8** | Count | 8,444 | 3,000 | 535 | 982 | 4,909 | 982 |

| **10** | Duke | 22,655 | 12,000 | 1,480 | 2,658 | 9,175 | 2,658 |
| **11** | Prince | 88,414 | 32,000 | 6,810 | 13,065 | 49,604 | 13,065 |
| **12** | Prince | 88,414 | 50,000 | 6,810 | 13,065 | 31,604 | 13,065 |
| **13 + 14** | King | 214,294 | 135,000 | 17,340 | 34,156 | 61,954 | 34,156 |
| **14** | Emperor | 911,172 | 350,000 | 49,500 | 112,500 | 511,672 | 112,500 |

Below are sample entourages showing how funds could be spent. The specific entourage of any given NPC should be chosen by you with reference to the Demographics of Leveled Characters in your setting.

Members of a ruler’s entourage might be followers or henchmen, or might be non-henchmen mercenaries retained for pay. If the latter, they will have the loyalty of Mercenary Commanders or Non-Henchmen Vassals depending on their relationship and treatment (Judge’s discretion). Since henchmen slots are limited and followers are only available at high level, most rulers are forced to choose between having untrustworthy people in their entourage or having untrustworthy people managing their sub-domains.

EXAMPLE: The adventurers are attacking Aura to claim the throne, where they will face the usurper Tarkaun Drakomir. Drakomir is a 14th level fighter. As an emperor, he can call on a maximum of 1 divine spellcasters of 12th, 11th, and 10th level, and 2 9th level divine casters. He can call on 2 other NPCs of 13th, 12th, and 11th level, 3 of 10th level, and 6 of 9th level. The Judge decides the emperor’s entourage is as follows:

Regent of the Tower of Knowledge: 1 x 13th level mage

Prefect of the Emperor’s Talons: 1 x 13th level fighter

Grand Patriarch of the Temple of the Winged Sun: 1 x 12th level crusader

Master of Spies: 1 x 12th level thief

Master of Coin: 1 x 12th level venturer

Matriarch of the Keepers of the Hearth Fire: 1 x 11th level priestess

Blade-Mistress of the Temple of the Blade and Veil: 1 x 10th level bladedancer

Patriarchs of the Temple of the Winged Sun: 2 x 9th level crusaders

Officers of the Emperor’s Talons: 3 x 10th level fighters, 2 x 9th level assassins, 2 x 9th level bards, 2 x 9th level fighters

The emperor has CHA 13 and Leadership proficiency, enabling him to have 6 henchmen. As Tarkaun of Aura, he has five vassals: the exarchs of Krysea, Nicea, Opelenea, Southern Argollë, and Tirenea. The Judge decides that the exarchs of Krysea, Nicea, and Southern Argollë are henchmen, while those of Opelenea and Tirenea are non-henchman vassals. That leaves the emperor with 3 henchmen available. The Judge decides that the Prefect of the Emperor’s Talons, the Master of Spies, and the Master of Coin are his henchmen. The other members of the entourage are non-henchmen and thus less loyal.

## 0th Level NPCs

In the early stages of your campaign, most of the NPCs you generate will be 0th level characters – a mix of prospective henchmen, local merchants, mercenaries, ruffians, and specialists. You can use the following rules to generate 0th level characters.

### Occupation

The first step in creating a 0th level NPC is to determine his occupation. A 0th level NPC might be anything from a court astrologer, a kitchen scullion, a hard-bitten mercenary, to a burly blacksmith. The number of classes in ***ACKS II*** is dwarfed by the number of possible occupations that might be held by the 0th level NPCs in the game world!

* If you are generating an occupant of a settlement building, their occupations will be have already been determined using the Building Occupant tables (p. XX) when you created the building.
* If you are generating a prospective henchman, you can choose or roll for their occupation on the General/Street column of the Random Building Occupant by Building Type table (p. XX). Re-roll results of 84-85, 96-97, and 99.
* If you are generating a mercenary or specialist, their occupation will always be their troop type or specialty.

EXAMPLE: The adventurers have solicited henchmen in a Class V town and one 0th level character has responded. The Judge needs to generate this prospective henchmen. He starts by rolling on General/Street column of the Random Building Occupant by Building Type table. The roll is an 77, so the NPC is a laborer. Rolling on the Laborer Occupation sub-table, the Judge gets a 74 – the NPC’s occupation is sawyer/woodcutter.

### Attributes

When you create a 0th level character, you can use any of the following methods to generate their attribute scores:

* Assign each of the NPC’s attributes a score between 9 and 11. The NPC has no attribute bonuses or penalties.
* Assign four of the NPCs’ attributes a score between 9 and 11. Assign one an 8 (-1) and another a 13 (+1).
* Roll 3d6 in order (STR, INT, WIL, DEX, CON, CHA) and record the NPCs’ attributes. Swap any two if sensible for the NPC given his occupation or likely future class. This is the best option to use for henchmen prospects.

if you want to generate a 0th level character with better-than-average talent or aptitude, use one of the recommended options for player characters (see p. XX).

EXAMPLE: The Judge is rolling attributes for a 0th level woodcutter. He decides to just roll 3d6 in order for his attributes. His rolls are STR 9, INT 13, WIL 11, DEX 10, CON 8, CHA 11. Given that woodcutting requires hard labor he decides to swap INT and CON. The woodcutter isn’t the strongest or the smartest, but he has the endurance to work the job. The Judge notes that explorer might be the best class for the woodcutter to advance into if he gains XP, since CON is the explorer’s primary attribute.

### Armor Class, Hit Dice, Speed, Attack Throws, and Saving Throws

Like adventurers, 0th level NPCs have base Armor Class scores of 0 and Speeds of 40’ / 120’ / 360’. Their attack throws and saving throws are calculated by HD, as modified by their race. 0th level NPCs have hit dice determined by their race. Humans have ½ HD, or 1-1 HD if trained as mercenaries. Dwarves have ½ HD, or 1-1 HD if militia. Elves have 1-1 HD, or 1 HD if militia. However, noncombatants (such as expectant mothers or disabled elderly) will have worse characteristics. The table below summarizes this data. The ***ACKS II******Monstrous Manual***has detailed entries for NPCs.

|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Race | Noncombatant | Commoner | Milita/Mercenary | Fighter 1 |
| Dwarf | ¼ HD (1 hp) | ½ HD (1d4 hp) | 1-1 HD (1d8-1 hp) | 1 HD (1d8 hp) |
| Elf | ¼ HD (1d2 hp) | 1-1 HD (1d6 hp) | 1 HD (1d8 hp) | 1+1 HD (1d8+1 hp) |
| Human | ¼ HD (1 hp) | ½ HD (1d4 hp) | 1-1 HD (1d8-1 hp) | 1 HD (1d8 hp) |

EXAMPLE: The woodcutter’s characteristics are AC 0, Speed 40’ / 120’ / 360’, HD 1/2, attack throw 11+, save F0. Because of his 13 CON, he’ll get one extra hit point. If the woodcutter had previously been trained as a mercenary, he would have 1-1 HD. If the woodcutter were an expectant mother, she’d have ¼ HD.

### Proficiencies

0th level characters will begin with anywhere from 4 to 15 proficiencies. (If they have 16 proficiencies or more, they’re leveled characters.) These proficiencies can be combat proficiencies, general proficiencies, or even class proficiencies. You can choose the proficiencies for the NPC using your judgment, or use the Proficiencies by Occupation tables, below, to determine them.

#### General Proficiencies

|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Proficiencies** | **Human**  **Age** | **Dwarf**  **Age** | **Elf**  **Age** | **Nobiran**  **Age** | **Zaharan**  **Age** |
| **1** | 9-12 | 9-12 | 9-12 | 9-12 | 9-12 |
| **2** | 13-15 | 13-19 | 13-25 | 13-15 | 13-15 |
| **3** | 16-17 | 20-25 | 26-50 | 16-17 | 16-17 |
| **4** | 18-22 | 26-30 | 51-55 | 18-22 | 18-22 |
| **5** | 23-32 | 31-40 | 56-65 | 23-32 | 23-32 |
| **6** | 33-52 | 41-50 | 66-85 | 33-52 | 33-52 |
| **7** | 53-87 | 61-95 | 86-120 | 53-98 | 53-87 |
| **8** | 88+ | 96+ | 121+ | 99+ | 88+ |

When they reach adulthood, 0th level humans and demi-humans of average Intellect have four general proficiencies. (Youth have proportionately fewer.) Usually one of these is a proficiency associated with their occupation. The others are ancillary skills acquired while growing up.

0th level characters thereafter gain an additional general proficiency after 5 years, 15 years, 35 years, and 70 years of work. Usually these are additional ranks in their occupation’s proficiency, but they can be avocations, hobbies, or new . If their INT is 13 or greater, the adults can gain additional general proficiencies equal to their IINT bonus. An NPC cannot select the same proficiency more than once with his four starting proficiencies, but can use bonus proficiencies from high INT or years of work experience to do so.

EXAMPLE: The woodcutter is a young man with four general proficiencies. His occupational proficiency is Labor (woodcutting). The Judge decides to “double down” on his CON score, and select Endurance as well. That uses up two of his four proficiencies.

#### Class Proficiencies

Occasionally, 0th level characters might have one class proficiency instead of or in addition to a general proficiency. This usually represents either a rare natural talent (such as Prophecy) or specialized training at a military academy, seminary, wizard’s college, and so on.

EXAMPLE: The woodcutter is just an ordinary lumberjack so he has no class proficiencies.

#### Combat Proficiencies

Most 0th level characters are **noncombatants**.Noncombatants have ML scores of -2 and have only one combat proficiency: single weapon fighting style. (They know how to pick something up and bash someone with it or throw it.) Because they have no weapon proficiencies, they always suffer a -1 penalty to their attack throw by HD with whatever they use.

Some 0th level characters are **combatants** with combat proficiencies. These NPCs can wear armor and wield weapons in which they are proficient with relative effectiveness. Their morale scores will range from -1 to +1.

0th level characters who belong to military occupations (or who receive training from a marshal) will have numerous combat proficiencies in addition to their general proficiencies. 0th level characters who do not belong to military occupations must count any combat proficiencies against their general proficiencies.

EXAMPLE: Since the woodcutter spends all day cutting down trees with a hatchet, the Judge decides that the woodcutter has weapon proficiency with axes and fighting style proficiency with two-handed weapons. That is two proficiencies, and uses up his four proficiency slots.

#### Proficiencies by Occupation

The following tables can be used to quickly assign proficiencies to NPCs based on their occupation. The first proficiency listed is always the core proficiency for the NPC’s occupation. The remaining proficiencies can represent career-related skills, avocations, local lore, specialized training, etc. If you don’t know the NPC’s occupation you can roll for it on the tables on p. XX – p. XX.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Entertainers** | **Proficiencies** |

| Musician | Performance (sing/instrument), Folkways, Revelry, Streetwise |
| Singer | Performance (sing/instrument), Folkways, Seduction, Streetwise |
| Carouser | Gambling, Folkways, Revelry, Streetwise |

Apprentice entertainers will have one rank in Performance, journeyman will have two ranks, and masters will have three ranks. Actors are assumed to have Weapon Proficiency (swords & daggers) from stage fighting, but feel free to substitute another proficiency more appropriate to a particular entertainer.

|  |  |

| **Merchants** | **Proficiencies** |
| Bookseller | Profession (merchant), Craft (scribe), Bargaining, Folkways |
| Chandler/Upholder | Profession (merchant), Craft (candlemaking), Bargaining, Folkways |

| Poulterer | Profession (merchant), Animal Husbandry, Bargaining, Folkways |
| Salter/Pepperer | Profession (merchant), Craft (cooking), Bargaining, Folkways |
| Vintner | Profession (merchant), Craft (winemaking), Bargaining, Folkways |

Apprentice merchants will have one rank in their Profession, licensed merchants will have two ranks, and master merchants will have three ranks. Unless they have additional proficiencies from high INT, they will have just one rank in the Art, Craft, or Labor associated with the merchandise they deal in – just enough to identify quality.

### Age of 0th Level NPCs

You can randomly determine the age of 0th-level NPCs using the table below. Increase age by 2d8 years for dwarves and 2d20 years for elves. Highly intelligent NPCs (INT 13+) might be journeymen or masters earlier than the average, because they will have additional proficiencies available without waiting for years of life experience.

|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Class** | **Starting Age** | **Class** | **Starting Age** | **Class** | **Starting Age** |
| Artisan | 17 + 1d6\* | Alchemist | 21 + 1d6\* | Sage | 21 + 1d6 |
| Laborer | 17 + 1d6 | Animal Trainer | 17 + 1d6\* | Siege Engineer | 21 + 2d6 |
| Hosteller | 21 + 1d6\* | Artillerist | 21 + 2d6 | Ship Captain | 17 + 3d6 |
| Mercenary | 17 + 1d6 | Engineer | 21 + 1d6\* |  |  |
| Minor Ecclesiastic | 17 + 2d6 | Healer | 21 + 1d6\* |  |  |
| Minor Magician | 17 + 2d6 | Marshal | 21 + 2d6 |  |  |
| Performer | 17 + 1d6\* | Navigator | 17 + 2d6 |  |  |
| Professional | 21 + 1d6\* | Quartermaster | 17 + 2d6 |  |  |
| \*Add 1d10 years if the NPC has one additional rank in his occupational proficiency and 3d10 years for two additional ranks | | | | | |

This table purposefully skews young, as we imagine you will mostly use it randomly generate the ages of 0th level henchmen. Obviously, many 0th level NPCs will be much older than 1st level adventurers. Most people do not set out as youths in search of danger nor do they devote themselves to their careers with absolute intensity. Feel free to add 1d6, 1d10, or even 2d10 years of age to more placid NPCs.

**Designer’s Note:** Based on the demographic data we developed for the Economics of Aurëpos, the average human is around 25 years old. A typical peasant or urban family includes a 38-year old father, a 32-year old mother, a 13-year old child, an 8-year old child, a 5-year old child. There might also be a 48-year old grandparent or relative and a 32- year old sibling. They will have buried two children, one 2-year old and one 11-year old. Obviously no actual peasant family is exactly “average” so the variations will be great, perhaps +/-1d10 years in either direction for the family as a whole.

### Advancement to 1st Level

The amount of XP required to advance for a 0th level character to advance to 1st level is equal to (16 – number of proficiencies) x 60. If you don’t know the exact number of proficiencies an NPC has, assume he requires 500 XP to advance to 1st level.

EXAMPLE: A cataphract and a gongfarmer become henchmen and start adventuring. The cataphract has 11 proficiencies, so he needs just (16 – 11) x 60 = 300 XP to reach 1st level. The gongfarmer has just 4 proficiencies, so he needs (16 – 4) x 60 = 720 XP to reach 1st level. As a highly-trained military soldier, the cataphract requires much less time and experience to gain the skills needed.

A 0th level character can earn experience points from adventurers or campaign activities.

**Adventures:** A 0th level character who participates in an adventure will earn experience points as a henchman.

**Magical Research:** A 0th level apprentice who studies under an arcane spellcaster of 9th level or higher can become 1st level mages. The apprentice must first undertake dedicated study. Assuming he starts with 4 proficiencies, he needs (12 x 60) = 720 XP to advance. If he studies at 6 days per week, with a research rate of 2.5gp per day, it will take 49 weeks, about a year). He then must make a research throw of 18+ (modified by INT). If the throw succeeds, the apprentice advances to 1st level. If the throw fails on an unmodified 1-3, the apprentice becomes discouraged by his inaptitude for magic and leaves the mage’s service. On any other result, the apprentice fails to advance in level and loses all of the accumulated campaign XP, but can continue his studies.

**Domain and Mercantile Income:** A 0th level character can earn XP from domain and mercantile income. They are treated as if they had an XP Threshold of 25gp. The character will advance into a type of class appropriate to way the XP was earned. For instance, a petty noble’s son (0th level character) who inherits his father’s small domain (125gp per month) will earn 50 XP per month (125gp – 25gp), advancing to become a 1st level fighter after 5 months as serving as baron (if bandits don’t kill him first).

**Hijinks:** A 0th level character can earn XP from perpetrating hijinks (usually carousing or racketeering). When the 0th level character earns 500xp from hijinks, he can become a 1st level assassin, nightblade, or thief. Which class will depend on his race (only elves may be nightblades) and the sort of company the character is keeping. On average, it takes 0th level characters several years of consorting with unsavory sorts in dimly-lit taverns to advance to become a “real” thief.

When a 0th level character advances to 1st level, he gains the Adventuring proficiency and the attack throws, saving throws, class powers, and proficiencies of his new class. The character re-rolls his hit points using his new class’s Hit Die, keeping either his new hp total or his prior hp total +1 if it was higher.

The new 1st level character retains any proficiencies he already knew. If these proficiencies are equivalent to any of the class powers of his new class, they are replaced by the newly-gained class powers. If the proficiencies are not part of his class powers, they count against his limit of proficiencies from level, INT and/or time and training (p. XX). If he has more general proficiencies than permitted by level, INT, and time and training, he loses one proficiency each month of game time, representing the erosion of his old professional skills over time. If he has more class proficiencies than permitted, or class proficiencies not permitted to his class at all, he loses them when he advances to 1st level.

## NPC Parties

Wandering monsters may sometimes include parties of NPC adventures out seeking their own fortunes. To determine the composition of an NPC adventuring party, follow the procedure below, or make them up as needed.

Begin by establishing the number encountered by rolling 1d4+2. Then roll 1d100 x 1d100 on the table below to determine a class for each NPC:

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | **NPC Class** | | | | | | | | **1d100x100** | **01-10** | **11-30** | **31-50** | **51-75** | **76-90** | **91-100** | | 1-40 | Mage | Thief | Crusader | Fighter | Explorer | Venturer | | 41-60 | Mage | Bard | Bladedancer | Fighter | Explorer | Venturer | | 61-80 | Mage | Assassin | Priestess | Fighter | Explorer | Venturer | | 81-90 | Mage | Thief | Shaman | Barbarian | Explorer | Venturer | | 91-94 | Elven Spellsword | Elven Nightblade | Dwarven Craftpriest | Dwarven Vaultguard | Special | Special | | 95-96 | Warlock | Special | Witch | Paladin | Special | Special | | 97-98 | Warlock | Special | Witch | Paladin | Special | Special | | 99-100 | Nobiran Wonderworker | Special | Special | Zaharan Ruinguard | Special | Special | | On a result of “Special,” choose a class from ***AXIOMS****,* ***BTA****,* ***Heroic Fantasy Handbook****,* and/or***Player’s Companion***orcreate a custom class. | | | | | | | |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Roll** | **NPC Alignment** |
| **1-2** | Lawful |
| **3-5** | Neutral |
| **6** | Chaotic |

Once classes are established, roll 1d6 to randomly determine the alignment of the party. All NPCs will either be of this alignment, or within one step of it. For example, a Lawful party may have Lawful and Neutral adventurers.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Roll** | **NPC Level** |
| **1** | Base level -2 (min. 1) |
| **2** | Base level -1 (min. 1) |
| **3-4** | Base level |
| **5** | Base level +1 |
| **6** | Base level +2 |

Each NPC party will have a base level, which is the average for the party as a whole. When NPCs are encountered in a dungeon, their base level will be determined by the dungeon level they are encountered on, as shown on the Random Monsters by Level tables. When NPCs are encountered in a wilderness, their base level should be based on the maximum level of the nearest dungeon. When NPCs are encountered in a settlement, their base level is 7, less the settlement’s market class. Once the base level of the party is determined, roll 1d6 on the NPC Level table to determine the level of each NPCs in the party.

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Level** | **TT** | **Level** | **TT** |
| **1** | Bx1/4 | **8** | J |
| **2** | Bx1/2 | **9** | Jx2 |
| **3** | Bx1/2 | **10** | N |
| **4** | B | **11** | O |
| **5** | Dx1/2 | **12** | Nx2 |
| **6** | D | **13** | Q |
| **7** | H | **14** | R |

If desired, you can replace one or more of the NPCs present with 2 NPCs of the same class but two levels lower. These characters would be henchmen of the higher level characters present in the NPC party.

EXAMPLE: An NPC party of three characters with a base level of 9 is generated. It includes a 9th level fighter, a 9th level crusader, and an 8th level thief. The Judge decides to replace the 9th level crusader with two 7th level crusaders, and decides these are the fighter’s henchmen.

NPCs will carry mundane weapons, armor, and equipment appropriate to their class, level, and terrain. When in the wilderness, they will have a 20% chance of having mounts for each level of experience. NPCs will also carry treasure and magic items. Use the table to the right to determine the treasure carried by each NPC based on his level. However, do not roll against the Treasure Type for magic items. Instead, consult the Magic Item Availability by NPC Level table (p. XX). Divide the number of items by 2 (rounding down), as not every item is always carried.

EXAMPLE: To determine a 9th level NPC fighter’s carried treasure, the Judge would roll against Treasure Type J x 2 for coins, gems, and jewelry. Instead of rolling on TT J x 2 for magic items, however, the Judge rolls on the Magic Item Availability by NPC Level, dividing the number of items by 2.

## NPC Appearance

Determining the appearance of a character, whether PC or NPC, is important; after all, their appearance is the first thing anyone notices about them, whether it is how they look physical, or what they wear and carry. It can be notably difficult to come up with a quick trait to distinguish individual NPCs, especially the otherwise nameless individuals PCs might unexpectedly address while at an inn or in the village market, or in the case of groups of otherwise identical foes such as bandits or beastmen, fight. Yet, it can be useful to give some at least a single defining trait, if only to make it easier to know who is fighting who.

Although you can simply assign a character whatever height, weight, and appearance traits you desire, it can be fun to roll for these elements randomly, especially if inspiration hasn’t struck. The following provides the means to generate builds, heights, weights, and distinguishing features for characters including the influence of high or low Strength, as well as eye, hair and skin color based on the races and cultures of the Auran Empire setting. Of course, you should feel free to simply choose results too as these characteristics have no real mechanical impact on play. (Not even weight! All characters count as 15 stone.)

So that they can be used for a wide variety of NPC types, some tables are split into Chaotic/Any/Lawful tables; Judges should select the tables most appropriate to the individual(s) they are determining traits for. Tables labelled “Any” may typically be used for nearly any NPC regardless of Alignment.

Most of the results in the various tables can easily be presented in different terms. Broad can be *wide-shouldered* or *curvaceous*, Small can be *petite* or *elfin*, Slim can be *slender* or *svelte*, Tall can be *statuesque*, and so on. Also, when looking at belongings, consider color, materials, and style. That cap could be faded purple velvet with a wilted feather or it could be crudely stitched rat skin, for example.

### How to Use These Tables

* For PCs, use Part One: Height and Weight; Part Two: Eye Color, Hair Color and Texture, and Skin Color; and Part Three: Physical Features. Roll or make choices along the way as desired based on Charisma and Race/Culture.
* For highly detailed NPCs, follow the same process as for PCs if desired, but use Part Four: Belongings and Styles as well to determine those extra elements, rolling or making choices as necessary.
* For quick and unimportant NPCs, skip straight to Part Four: Belongings and Styles, to determine a single distinguishing trait.

### Part One: Height and Weight

Follow the steps below to determine a character’s height, weight, and general build.

#### Step 1: Determine Baseline

Roll for the character’s Baseline Height and Weight according to race and gender. The results may be modified by culture as noted here.

###### Baseline Height and Weight

#### Step 2: Determine Build

Roll 2d6, adding or subtracting twice any modifiers for high or low Strength. If the character’s build is Average for their race, there is no need to modify the baseline results from Step 1, and the process is finished. Ignore fractions of pounds when making calculations.

EXAMPLE #1*:* Hakan, a male crusader from Skysostan, has no modifiers for Strength. The Player rolls Hakan’s baseline Height and Weight, getting 67” and 138 lbs, but reduces the Height to 65” (5’5”) because Hakan is from Skysostan. The Player then rolls for Hakan’s Build, getting a result of 10; Hakan is *Broad*. This modifies the baseline Weight by 20%, adding 28 lbs for a total Weight of 166 lbs. At 5’5” and 166 lbs., Hakan is short and stocky!

EXAMPLE #2*:* Dagr the Mighty, a male barbarian from Jutland with Strength 17, has an impressive +2 Strength modifier, doubled to +4 for purposes of the character’s Build roll. The Player rolls Dagr’s baseline Height and Weight of 69” (increased to 72” due to Dagr being a Jutlander) and 142 lbs (increased by 12.5% to 160 lbs due to Dagr being a Jutlander). The Player then rolls for Dagr’s Build, adding the doubled Strength modifier of +4. He rolls a 10, for a final total of 12: *Large*. He increases Dagr’s Height by 10% to 79” (6’7”!) and his Weight by 3 0% to 256 lbs. Dagr’s a tall, highly impressive, and clearly strong individual.

EXAMLE #3*:* Aliyah, a female Shebatean thief, has a -1 Strength modifier. This translates as a -2 modifier on her Build roll. The Player rolls baselines of 60” (5’) and 128 lbs. She rolls for Build, subtracting 2 due to the Strength modifier and an extra 1 for being Shebatean, and gets a final number of 2: *Slim*. Aliyah’s Weight is reduced by 20% to 102 lbs. She’s a slender woman, slightly shorter than normal.

### Part Three: Physical Features

Sometimes, just one or two key physical points are all that is needed to help define what a character looks like. Characters with no CHA modifier should only roll once on the Average table. Characters with a negative CHA modifier should roll once on the Average table and then roll a number of times on the Negative table equal to their modifier. Characters with a positive CHA modifier should roll once on the Average table and then roll a number of times on the Positive table equal to their modifier. In the case of non-human characters, results should be interpreted or rerolled in some cases as needed.

## NPC Miscellaneous Possessions

A random pocket is picked or purse is cut. A random body is searched. Sometimes there are the on-the-spot moments when inspiration can fail or we fall back on a quick random roll of coins found. But the contents of a purse, pocket, or pouch can be varied and sometimes surprising, possibly even spurring further adventure in some cases.

The following tables help generate the random items and coins found in the pockets and purses of NPCs. They do not provide notable gains in wealth at lower levels, but do provide a variety of other possible oddments or items of interest. Even results that seemingly make little sense can be justified as the last belongings of someone fallen on hard times, keepsakes, or belongings pilfered from others.

When using these tables, you should consider the profession and standard of living of the individual being stolen from or searched; this helps determine the quality of anything found and what items incidental items they are likely to be bearing. A bread roll found on a beggar, for example, could be a discarded, moldy crust, while that of a prosperous merchant could be a soft saffron roll in which berries and seeds have been baked.

To use these tables, roll on the Coinage table to determine loose change and then roll 1d2 times on Random Items table (1d3 for Affluent and above). From there, roll on the appropriate sub-tables as directed.

EXAMPLE: With the recent decree making halflings citizens of the Empire, a wave of bite-sized burglary has swept through Cyfaraun. Among these miscreants midgets is Hyacinth Took, as in “Hyacinth took my wallet.” Hyacinth has recently picked the pocket of Beorn, a Jutland adventurer with a Prosperous lifestyle. The Judge rolls to see what she’s found! First, he rolls for Coinage. A roll of 2d6 and 1d6x10 yields 9gp and 20sp. Next, he rolls 1d2 for the number of Random Items; the result is a 2. He rolls 1d100 twice on the Random Items table. The first roll is a 73, a Tool; the second is 41, an Oddment. On the Tools table, the roll is a 4 x 5 – a pot of paint. The Judge decides this is Jutlandic woad, used as war-paint. On the Oddments table, the roll is an 18, a stone/pebble. The Judge interprets this as a rune-stone carrying a Jutlandic rune. The Judge begins to ponder how he might tie this into the draugr tomb in ***Lairs & Encounters****,* but Hyacinth actually just throws it all away. She just likes stealing things.

# PART III: ABSTRACTION

# Chapter 10: Abstract Dungeons

At times, it may arise in an *ACKS* campaign that a dungeon needs to be cleared out off-screen; perhaps henchmen are sent to do it, perhaps it’s simply a side detour that everyone wishes to be over quickly. Whatever the reason, what’s necessary is a set of rules that can be used to quickly and abstractly clear out dungeons. And that’s what we provide in this chapter!

## The Basics

The Abstract Dungeon rules assume that an organized group of **adventurers** goes on an **delve** to clear out a **dungeon**. The delve can consist of a single **foray** into the dungeon or multiple forays. Any number of adventurers can go on a delve, but a maximum of eight can go on any single foray into the dungeon.

 The **party** for a foray consists of one or more adventurers. The **party level** is the equal to the total of all characters’ levels, divided by the number of adventurers or by 4, whichever is greater. Round fractions of 0.5 or greater up, 0.49 or lower down. (Put another way, for parties of four or more adventurers, party level is equal to the average of the characters’ levels, while for parties of less than four adventurers, party level is equal to the sum of the characters’ levels divided by 4.)

EXAMPLE: The Claws of the Lioness are a party consisting of Ranya, a 4th level bladedancer; Girdanus Tarvo, a 3rd level fighter; Yrsa, a 4th level witch; and Maon, a 2nd level elven spellsword. The party level is [ (4 + 3 + 4 + 2) / 4] 3.25, rounded to 3.

EXAMPLE #2: Moruvai, a 9th level ruinguard, enters a dungeon alone. The party level for his foray is (9 / 4) 2.25, rounded to 2.

Parties of more than four adventurers gain a bonus in forays, discussed below.

## The Dungeon

A dungeon has both a **size** and a **level**. The size of the dungeon determines how many encounters it has, and the level determines how difficult those encounters are.

To find out how many encounters are in the dungeon, you can roll a number on the Encounters by Dungeon Size table below. Alternatively, if you have a mapped and stocked dungeon but simply want to abstract it, you can count up the number of rooms with monsters or traps.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Dungeon Size** | **Encounters** |
| Small | 1d3 |
| Medium | 2d3 |
| Large | 2d6 |
| Mega | 10d6 |

You should assign a dungeon level based on the difficulty of the encounters found in the dungeon (dungeon levels are defined from 1-6 as per *ACKS Core*). Presented at the end, in the Optional Rules section, are random tables for determining dungeon size and level.

In the case of a multi-level dungeon, treat each level as a separate dungeon. Access to lower levels may require clearing some or all of the encounters of a previous level, or they may all be accessible independently, at your discretion.

## Abstract Dungeon Foray Resolution

The interaction between party level and dungeon level determines the base difficulty and base modifier to the resolution roll. Consult the table below and find the party’s party level in the row for the appropriate dungeon level (see below if the party level is not listed in the row for the dungeon level). The value in the top row of that column is the base **resolution modifier** for that foray. The adjective in the row below it describes the relative **difficulty** of the foray.

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Base Resolution Modifier** | | | | | | | |
|  | -8 | -4 | -2 | 0 | +2 | +4 | +8 |
| **Dungeon Level** | Apocalyptic | Horrifying | Dangerous | Accessible | Easy | Simple | Effortless |
| **1** | - | - | - | 1 | 2-3 | 4-5 | 6-7 |
| **2** | - | - | 1 | 2-3 | 4-5 | 6-7 | 8-9 |
| **3** | - | 1 | 2-3 | 4-5 | 6-7 | 8-9 | 10-11 |
| **4** | 1 | 2-3 | 4-5 | 6-7 | 8-9 | 10-11 | 12-13 |
| **5** | 2-3 | 4-5 | 6-7 | 8-9 | 10-11 | 12-13 | 14 |
| **6** | 4-5 | 6-7 | 8-9 | 10-11 | 12-13 | 14 | - |

EXAMPLE: The Claws of the Lioness are a 3rd level party of four adventurers. The party is foraying into the Buried Temple of Sakkara, a 1st level dungeon. On the Dungeon Level 1 row, a party level of 2-3 results in a resolution modifier of +2 (Easy difficulty).

### Under- or Over-Strength Parties

If the party level is off the table, move up or down a number of rows until the party’s level is reached. Consider your difficulty to be an additional number of columns to the right (easier) for each row you moved down, or an additional number of columns to the left (harder) for each row you moved up. For each column to the left you are off the table, apply an additional -8 penalty. There is no additional bonus for being off the table to the right; there is always some chance of failure, but sometimes there is no chance of success.

EXAMPLE: The Claws of the Lioness launch a foray into the Ruined City of Zahar, a 6th level dungeon. Consulting the Base Resolution Modifier table, the Judge sees that the party level of 3 is off the table. The Judge shifts up one row to reach party level 2-3, with a resolution modifier of -8 (Apocalyptic difficulty). Since he moved one row up, he now shifts one row to the left to calculate the resolution modifier. That moves him one column off the table, triggering an additional -8 penalty, or -16 total!

### Number of Encounters

The number of encounters attempted in a foray factors into the resolution modifier as well. Consult the table below to see the adjustment made. A positive number moves the difficulty that many columns to the left, while a negative number moves the difficulty that many columns to the right. (That is, a positive number means that they are easier, while a negative number means they are harder.)

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Resolution Modifier by Encounters Attempted** | |
| **Encounters** | **Resolution Modifier** |
| 1 | +1 |
| 2 | 0 |
| 3-5 | -1 |
| 6-8 | -2 |
| 9-12 | -3 |
| Each additional 3 | Additional -1 |

### Party Size

If there are five to seven adventurers, the party receives a +1 bonus to the resolution roll. If there are eight or more adventurers, the party receives a +2 bonus.

There is no penalty for having a small party, because if there are less than four adventurers, the party level will have been calculated as the sum of all levels divided by four, instead of being the average level. (A single 14th level character in a first level dungeon would count as a 4th level party, giving them a +4 modifier.)

## The Resolution Table

Once the total modifier is known, roll 1d8+1d12 on the resolution table, adding the resolution modifier to the result.

| **Abstract Dungeon Resolution** | |
| **Roll (1d8+1d12)** | **Result** |
| 2- | Catastrophic |
| 3-5 | Dreadful |
| 6-8 | Unsatisfactory |
| 9-12 | Indifferent |
| 13-16 | Satisfactory |
| 17-19 | Excellent |
| 20+ | Stupendous |

**Catastrophic:** Every adventurer is slain. An expedition may be sent to retrieve their bodies; if the new party successfully fully clears the dungeon, they may retrieve the bodies of the fallen in lieu of treasure. (They receive experience as normal for encounters defeated.)

**Dreadful:** 1d6 adventurers suffer mortal wounds. No treasure is earned from this foray.

**Unsatisfactory:** 1d4-1 adventurers suffer mortal wounds. Only 50% of normal treasure is earned from this foray.

**Indifferent:** 1d3-2 adventurers suffer mortal wounds. 100% of normal treasure is earned from this foray.

**Satisfactory:** 1d4-3 adventurers suffer mortal wounds. 125% of normal treasure is earned from this foray.

**Excellent:** 1d6-5 adventurers suffer mortal wounds. 150% of normal treasure is earned from this foray.

**Stupendous:** On a stupendous result, no adventurers suffer mortal wounds, and 200% of normal treasure is earned from this foray.

When one or more adventurers suffer a mortal wound, determine which adventurer was injured randomly. An adventurer who suffers a mortal wound may no longer participate in the expedition until they recover. Roll on the Mortal Wounds - Savage table using only the adventurer's Constitution, and HD, and equipment modifiers as adjustments to the d20. An adventurer whose mortal wound requires that he be healed to 1 HP dies unless the party can heal the character or bring him back to civilization in the time allotted.

EXAMPLE:A party of four 14th level characters find themselves in front of a 1st level dungeon. Bored, they decide to slaughter its inhabitants. The Judge informs them that this dungeon has twelve encounters; they laugh and say they will fight all twelve. Facing 11 encounters on a single foray has a difficulty modifier of -3. The listed level for Effortless on a first level dungeon is 6-7, so the 14th level characters are off the table to the right. There is no additional bonus for being off the table to the right; there is always some chance of failure, but sometimes there is no chance of success. Their total resolution modifier is 8 – 3 = +5. They roll 1d12+1d8+5 on the Resolution Table and score a 20 – a Stupendous success. They slaughter the dungeon’s inhabitants mercilessly and reap 200% of normal treasure.

## After the Foray

Each foray requires one day of strenuous dedicated activity. The party might need additional rest if it has suffered casualties. After the foray is resolved, if the dungeon is not fully cleared, additional monsters might arrive in the interim before the next foray. For each full day that passes until the next foray, roll the listed die for the dungeon size on the Dungeon Restocking table. Add the result to the number of encounters remaining in the dungeon, up to the maximum of the original number of encounters in the dungeon. A roll of zero (or less) indicates that no new monsters arrived after that foray.

EXAMPLE: A party has undertaken an expedition to a medium dungeon that had five encounters originally. In their first foray, they cleared three encounters, leaving two remaining. They are called away to handle domain matters, returning for another foray three days later. Since three days have passed, the Judge rolls 2d3-4 three times. The first roll is 0, the second roll is a 1, and the third roll is a -2 (rounded to 0). Therefore the number of encounters in the dungeon increases from two to three.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Dungeon Restocking** | |
| **Dungeon Size** | **Encounters Restocked** |
| Small | 1d3-2 |
| Medium | 2d3-4 |
| Large | 2d6-7 |
| Mega | 2d12-13 |

Encounters that arrive as a result of restocking grant combat experience as normal, but carry no treasure; ignore the Treasure result of the resolution roll and consider it to be 0 for any restocked encounter.

## Treasure and Experience

After each foray, a party receives an amount of treasure and experience determined by the number of encounters defeated and the level of the dungeon. A party that fails to fully clear the dungeon receives only one-quarter the indicated amount of treasure, but full experience for the encounters they defeated.

Consult the Treasure and Experience by Dungeon Level table for the amount of treasure and experience gained per defeated encounter. The total number of encounters defeated should be counted up as forays are resolved, with a running total of gold and XP earned thus far kept. The final calculation of treasure and experience earned should be done only when the party chooses to withdraw entirely or fully clears the dungeon.

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Treasure and Experience by Dungeon Level** | | |
| **Dungeon Level** | **XP Per Encounter** | **Treasure Per Encounter** |
| **1** | 90 | 360 |
| **2** | 140 | 560 |
| **3** | 320 | 1280 |
| **4** | 625 | 2500 |
| **5** | 1835 | 7340 |
| **6** | 4795 | 19180 |

### Magic Items

Parties that fully clear a dungeon may find magical items as well as gold. Each dungeon level has a varying chance of items being present as well as variable amount of items found. The Magical Items table, below, shows how often to roll and which treasure type to roll as. In all cases, the mechanic is to roll for magical items per X full gold pieces found. When rolling for magic items, use the treasure type only to roll for magical items; do not roll for gold, gems, jewelry, or anything else. (Everything with a GP value is abstracted into the amount of gold found already.)

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Magical Items** | | |
| **Dungeon Level** | **GP Per Roll** | **Treasure Type** |
| **1** | 1000 | D |
| **2** | 1250 | E |
| **3** | 3250 | I |
| **4** | 6000 | L |
| **5** | 22000 | Q |
| **6** | 45000 | R |

### Allocating Treasure and XP

If the adventuring party is PCs, or NPCs acting on their own behalf, they retain all earned treasure and experience and gain experience from treasure found as normal. If the adventuring party is henchmen or followers, their employer gains no combat XP, and the henchmen or followers receive half combat XP. The henchmen or followers receive half of all loot found (gaining XP from retained loot as normal), with the other half going to the employer, for whom it is treated as campaign XP (affected by GP threshold mechanics as normal).

## Example of Abstract Dungeon Resolution

Marcus, a 12th level fighter, has established a domain in a borderlands hex. In an adjacent hex, he discovers a small ruined fort. He and his other high-level companions are occupied with pressing matters of war and politics, so they dispatch their henchmen to clear out the ruins – 3 1st level henchmen, 2 2nd level henchmen, and 1 5th level henchman.

The Judge has determined that the ruined fort counts as a small dungeon, and he has assigned it a dungeon level of 1. The Judge rolls for the number of encounters and finds that this is a three-encounter dungeon. The party level is [ (1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 5) / 6 ] = 2. The Judge first consults the Base Resolution Modifier table to determine the base resolution modifier. He sees that a 2nd level party in a 1st level dungeon has a base resolution modifier of +2 (Easy). Because there are six adventurers in the party, they receive a +1 bonus, for a total of +3.

The players declare that their henchmen will attempt to clear out only two of the three encounters in their first foray. Consulting the Resolution Modifier by Encounters Attempted table, the Judge sees that attempting two encounters has no modifier.

It’s time to roll on the Resolution table. They roll 1d8+1d12, and the total is an unfortunately low 5!  Even with the party’s +3 modifier, the resulting 8 is an outcome of Unsatisfactory. Two encounters are successfully cleared, but only 50% treasure is earned from them. Clearing two encounters on a first level dungeon is worth 180 XP and 720 gp worth of treasure normally; halving this treasure means that the running total so far is 180 XP and 360 GP.

In addition, 1d4-1 adventurers suffer mortal wounds. A roll of 3-1 = 2 on this d4 means that two of the adventurers suffer mortal wounds, and can no longer participate in forays. The Judge randomly determines that one 1st and one 2nd level adventurer suffer mortal wounds.

The Judge now rolls on the Dungeon Restocking table. Since the ruined fort is a small dungeon, he rolls 1d3-1. The roll is a 1, modified to 0, so no new monsters have arrived and just one encounter remains in the dungeon.

The players consider their options; if they withdraw without clearing the dungeon, they have no chance at magic items, and they would receive only 25% of the 360 gp they have managed to find so far. They decide to send the henchmen back in for a second foray to clear the dungeon. The party level is unchanged, as [ (1 + 1 + 2 + 5) / 4 ] = 2. With a dungeon level of 1, their base modifier remains +2. However, the party has been reduced to only four combat-ready henchmen, which removes the party’s +1 modifier for party size. However, with only one encounter left to be cleared, they move the difficulty one row to the right on the base difficulty table, giving them a final modifier of +4.

They roll 1d8+1d12 for their second foray, and roll a 15, for a modified total of 19!  This Excellent result earns them 150% treasure from this encounter. Only 1d6-5 adventurers suffer mortal wounds; the 1d6 roll is a 4 so no one suffered harm. The Judge adds another 90 XP and (360 \* 1.5) 540 GP is added to what has been found thus far.

With the dungeon safely cleared, the adventurers can retain all of their gains, for a total of 270 XP and 900 GP. Sadly, this is not enough GP to roll for magic items (a level 1 dungeon requires a full 1,000 GP per magic item roll). Because this adventuring party is composed of henchmen, they receive half combat XP, plus XP for the 50% of the gold they get to retain, for a total of (135 + 450) = 585 XP gained (to be divided among them as normal).

The henchmen return to their employers with loot to divide and stories to tell, with only one in three among them having been maimed by the experience.

Note that in the example above, the players made all the decisions about their henchman; as always, at your discretion, the henchmen can make their own decisions. The Morale rules (***ACKS II******Revised Rulebook***, p. XX) can be used to determine how the henchmen react. Perhaps after seeing two among them maimed the first time they went into a dungeon, they decided that two encounters was enough! If that were the case, they would walk out of the dungeon with only 25% of the running total of treasure, giving them base earnings of 180 XP plus 90 GP. (As henchmen, they would gain only half XP from the combat and keep half of that treasure.) In addition, even if 25% of earned treasure had been sufficient to qualify for a magic item roll, failing to fully clear the dungeon would prevent them from getting to roll.

Remember also that a henchman receiving a mortal wound usually qualifies as a calamity, and grounds for a loyalty check. For the purpose of this example, we assumed both maimed henchmen are loyal and decided to stay with the party, but that will not always be true!

## Optional Rules

A variety of optional rules or expanded rules can be used with abstract dungeons.

### Finding Monster Parts

A party might wish to retrieve monster parts (special components) from the dungeon. They can exchange treasure found for monster parts, up to a limit of their metamphora capacity or the XP of defeated monsters, whichever is lower. This exchange does not alter their chance to find magical items.

EXAMPLE: A party that defeats three encounters in a first-level dungeon has earned a base of 270 XP and 1080 GP. If they desire, they may trade 270 GP worth of that 1080 GP for monster parts instead, assuming they have the metamphora to store 270 GP worth of monster parts, giving them 270 XP earned, plus 270 GP worth of monster parts, plus 810 GP.

The specific monster that the parts come from should be determined by you. You might pick the monsters based on the region and dungeon, you might allow the adventurers to specify the monster parts they are seeking, or determine it randomly by rolling on the dungeon or wilderness encounter chart, as you feel is appropriate for the situation.

### Multiple Forays

Some parties might wish to push their luck and continue foraying after defeating encounters already. If so, the encounter modifier for forays after the first should be calculated based on the total number of encounters that day, plus an additional -1 penalty per foray after the first.

EXAMPLE: A party has forayed and cleared two encounters already, before finding that they now have access to a lower dungeon level. They decide to immediately charge on downwards and declare two encounters on the lower level. Their encounter-based difficulty modifier is calculated as if they had declared four encounters (a penalty of -1), plus an additional -1 for being their second foray of the day, for a total of -2 difficulty steps. If they survived that, and declared two more encounters, their penalty would be -2 (for six encounters), plus an additional -2 (for being the third foray), for a total of -4 steps. This example party who has pushed their luck this far has likely died at this point.

### Random Dungeon Size and Level

If you do not want to decide what size and level a randomly located dungeon is, you can determine their values randomly. Roll 1d100 for each on the tables below.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Random Dungeon Level** | |
| **Level** | **Roll (1d100)** |
| **1** | 1-51 |
| **2** | 52-77 |
| **3** | 78-90 |
| **4** | 91-96 |
| **5** | 97-99 |
| **6** | 100 |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Random Dungeon Size** | |
| **Size** | **Roll (1d100)** |
| **Small** | 1-54 |
| **Medium** | 55-81 |
| **Large** | 82-98 |
| **Mega** | 99-100 |

### Situational Modifiers to Resolution

If you want to go into greater detail in the factors that affect dungeon clearing success, you can apply situational modifiers to the resolution roll. These modifiers should affect the resolution roll directly, rather than altering the base difficulty. Below are examples of some potential situational modifiers.

* Party Missing Key Role: -1 per key role missing. Key roles are fighter, explorer, mage, crusader, thief, venturer. No adventurer can fill more than one key role at a time, so an elven spellsword could count as a fighter or a mage, but not both at once.
* Well-Balanced Party: +1. A well-balanced party covers all key roles.
* Party Well Prepared for Threats In Dungeon: +2
* Party Poorly Prepared for Threats in Dungeon: -2. An example of being well or poorly prepared would be whether a party brought wolfsbane, belladonna, and silver weapons to fight against werewolves.
* Party Has Unexpectedly Powerful Magic: +1. An example of this might be the PCs lending their henchmen some useful and powerful magic items before sending them off to clear a dungeon.

Generally speaking, a modifier of +/- 1 can be applied for things that are nice but not necessary, while things that are extraordinarily valuable or important receive a modifier of +/- 2. With a few exceptions for things that are suicidal or all but guaranteed, any individual situational modifier should not exceed plus or minus two.

### Travel Time To Dungeons

If you are a Judge who prefers to run low-prep, you might not want to fill out your campaign map with every possible dungeon in every possible hex. The Travel Time rules allow you to use this system without knowing where exactly the dungeons are beforehand; simply roll to find how far away they are from the point that the adventurers set out from. (Usually, this will be a fort, town or city of some kind.)

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Random Travel Time** | |
| **Dungeon Size** | **Travel Time** |
| Small | 1d6 days |
| Medium | 2d6 days |
| Large | 1d6 weeks |
| Mega | 1d6 months |

The level of civilization of the starting point affects the distance to dungeons. After rolling for base travel time, multiply the result by the starting point modifier: 4x base time if the starting point is Civilized, 2x base time if the starting point is Borderlands, and 1x base time if the starting point is Outlands. Note that the travel time given is one-way, and it will require an equal amount of time to return.

### Unknown Dungeon Size and Level

The Abstract Dungeon rules are written as if the players were aware of the size and level of the dungeon. This works well for solo play and might even be plausible if the adventurers are well-informed, have a dungeon map, etc. However, it is usually a better simulation of actual play if the dungeon size and level are kept secret from the players.

When the Unknown Dungeon Size and Level rule is in effect, the adventurers must foray without knowing the number of encounters or their level. The party must still declare how many encounters they will face. If they declare a number larger than the actual number remaining in the dungeon, use the modifier only for the number remaining. However, if there is only one encounter remaining, and the party is not aware of that, they receive a +0 modifier instead of +1 (because they needlessly conserve spells and resources).

Players can scout the dungeon instead of clearing encounters. To scout the dungeon, make a resolution roll as normal, as if the party was facing one-third of the total number of encounters in the dungeon. (Again, to a maximum modifier of +0.) Regardless of the result of this resolution roll, they receive neither experience nor treasure, and no encounters are cleared. Instead, they learn either the dungeon level or the number of encounters remaining in the dungeon, at their choice.

# Chapter 11: Abstract Wilderness

Whether traveling through the wilderness, or attempting to make hexes safe for civilization by rooting out all monster lairs within them, wilderness expeditions can take time to resolve. Players often want to send their character’s henchmen out on a wilderness journey, but that can involve a great deal of time and effort for you to resolve. These rules offer an abstract system that permits encounters to be quickly resolved.

## The Basics

The Abstract Wilderness rules assume that an organized group of **adventurers** goes on an **expedition** into the wilderness. The expedition will span multiple days, and can contain any number of adventurers, henchmen, mercenaries, hangers-on, and so on. Any expedition has an **Expedition Level**, which is calculated as the sum of the levels of all leveled characters, divided by six. Round any fractions down.

EXAMPLE 1: An expedition consists of a party of 3 6th, 1 5th, and 1 4th level PCs, and all of their henchmen, three of which are 4th level, five of which are 3rd level, and two of which are 2nd level. The sum of all their levels is 58. Dividing by six, this expedition has an Expedition Level of 9. (9.667, rounded down to 9.)

EXAMPLE 2: Another expedition consists of two 10th level PCs and their two henchmen, each 6th level. The sum of all their levels is 32. Dividing by six, this expedition has an Expedition Level of 5. (5.333, rounded down to 5).

Each adventurer in an expedition, as well as each platoon-scale unit that contributes to Army Adjustment (see below), is considered a single **participant** in the expedition. Participants in the expedition contribute to its success and are eligible for experience and gold. They are also at risk of injury and death, as described in Resolution, below. An expedition will also have a **scaling modifier** based on the number of participants. More details on the Scaling Modifier can be found on p. XX.

Unlike Abstract Dungeon exploration, which abstracts exploration and combat in the entire dungeon delve, Abstract Wilderness only abstracts the combat. Movement through, and exploration of, the wilderness should be handled with the standard rules for Wilderness Expeditions (see Chapter 2: **Adventures** and the ***ACKS II******Revised Rulebook****,* p. XX) and you should stock each hex with lairs following the usual procedures (p. XX). When the expedition encounters a pre-placed or random monster, group of monsters, or monster lair, the Abstract Wilderness rules can then be used to resolve the combat (or evasion). After the encounter is resolved, the ordinary mechanics for treasure and XP are applied.

#### Challenge Adjustments

Each wilderness encounter encountered has a **monster level** and **challenge adjustment**. The monster level is based on the power of the monster in general. The challenge adjustment reflects the variance in danger. The challenge adjustment is applied as a difficulty step bonus or penalty to your resolution roll. (The effect of the challenge adjustment can be reduced by your Army Adjustment; see below for more on Army Adjustments.)

###### Calculating Challenge Adjustment

To calculate the challenge adjustment for a monster encounter in the wilderness, follow these steps.

1. Calculate the **total XP value (XPV)** of the encounter by adding up the XPV of each individual monster encountered, including ordinary monsters, champions, leaders, animals, etc.
2. Find the **individual XPV** for the ordinary monster appearing in the encounter.
3. Consult the Monster Level table, below, and use the ordinary monster’s XPV value to determine the **monster level** and **monster XP divisor**. Write down the monster level for future reference.
4. Divide the total XPV by the monster XP divisor to find its **encounter quotient**.
5. Consult the Challenge Adjustment by Encounter Quotient table and use the encounter quotient to determine the **challenge adjustment** for the encounter.

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Monster Level** | |  |
| **Monster Individual XP Value** | **Level** | **Monster XP Divisor** |
| 1-15 | 1 | 90 |
| 20-47 | 2 | 140 |
| 50-150 | 3 | 320 |
| 175-475 | 4 | 625 |
| 500-1,140 | 5 | 1,835 |
| 1,200+ | 6 | 4,795 |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Encounter Quotient** | **Challenge Adjustment** |
| **0.25 or less** | +2 |
| **0.26 to 0.99** | +1 |
| **1 to 1.5** | +0 |
| **1.51 to 2** | -1 |
| **Greater than 2** | Divide encounter quotient by -2, round down, times -1 |

EXAMPLE: An expedition is exploring an unsettled hex when it has a monster encounter. The Judge rolls on the monster encounter tables and determines it is an orc encounter. The Judge rolls 1d100 to see if the orcs are in a lair, and rolls a 73; they are not in lair. A wilderness encounter with orcs consists of 2d6 gangs, each of which has 2d4 orcs. The Judge rolls for 8 gangs, consisting of 5, 3, 2, 3, 4, 6, 5, and 7 orcs, for a total of 35 orcs. Each gang is led by a champion, and the warband is led by a sub-chieftain. Each ordinary orc is worth 10 XP; each champion is worth 15 XP, and the sub-chieftain is worth 20. The total XP value of the wilderness encounter is therefore 350 + (15 \* 8) + 20 = 490.

Since the ordinary orc is worth 10 XP, it is monster level 1 with a challenge divisor of 90. Therefore, the Judge divides the total XPV (490) by the challenge divisor (90) to gets an encounter quotient of 5.44. Consulting the Encounter Quotient table, he sees that an encounter quotient of 5.44 requires further calculation. 5.44 divided by 2 yields 2.72; 2.72 rounds down to 2; 2 x -1 = -2. Therefore the challenge adjustment for the encounter is -2.

What if there had been more orcs, such that the total XPV of the encounter was 540 XP? In that case, the encounter quotient would have been 540 / 90 = 6. That would have yielded a challenge adjustment of 6 / 2 x -1 = -3.

#### Army Adjustment

Of course, if you’re going to be facing horrifically dangerous monsters in large quantities out in the middle of nowhere, it helps to have an **army**. Abstract Wilderness recognizes that. To determine your Army Adjustment, divide your army into platoon-scale units. You may benefit from a maximum number of platoon-scale units equal to the number of leveled characters of 3rd level or higher in your expedition. Your Army Adjustment is equal to the sum of the **Battle Rating** of all participating units.

EXAMPLE 1: An expedition containing six leveled characters brings 90 light infantry into the wilderness. 90 light infantry is three platoon-scale units, so they may all participate. These particular light infantry have a Battle Rating of 1 per unit. This expedition’s Army Adjustment is therefore +3.

EXAMPLE 2: An expedition containing four leveled characters brings along 120 light infantry, 60 heavy cavalry, and 120 archers. Because they contain only four leveled characters, they may not effectively command their entire army, and benefit only from the best four units. They choose to have their four platoon-scale units of heavy cavalry participate in the expedition. These units have BR 6 each, giving the expedition an Army Adjustment of +24.

To determine the effect that your Army Adjustment has on resolution, first determine the **Army Level** of your army units. For all units composed of normal humans (i.e., not leveled characters), this is an Army Level of 1. For other units, this is based on the individual XP value of the creatures composing your army, as if they were monsters (consult the Monster Level table above). In the case of cavalry, use the XP value of the member of the pair in command of the actions (Judge’s discretion, but usually, this is the rider).

For each level that the encounter’s Monster Level is greater than Army Level, divide the Army Adjustment by 2 (reducing it in half). Then add the modified Army Adjustment to the Challenge Adjustment**, to a maximum of +2,** to determine the final Challenge Adjustment. Round fractions of 0.5 or greater up, fractions of 0.49 or less down.

EXAMPLE 1: The first expedition has encountered a Monster Level 4 encounter with a Challenge Adjustment of -3. The expedition has an Army Adjustment of +3 and an Army Level of 1. Monster Level 4 – Army Level 1 = 3, so the Army Adjustment must be divided by 2 three times. Three3 divided by two 2 is 1.5, divided by two 2 is 0.75, divided by two 2 is 0.375, rounded down to 0. 90 ordinary light infantry does not help them in this situation, as the monsters simply drive through them.

EXAMPLE 2: The second expedition has encountered a Monster Level 4 encounter with a Challenge Adjustment of -3. Their army’s Army Level is still 1, but the Army Adjustment is +24. 24 divided by two is 12, divided by two is 6, divided by two is 3. Taking the Challenge Adjustment of -3 and adding 3 gives an adjustment of +0, which is much more likely to produce a good outcome!

Example 3: An expedition with an Army Adjustment of +24 and Army Level of 1 encounters a Monster Level 1 encounter with a Challenge Adjustment of -13. Since the Army Level equals the Monster Level, the full Army Adjustment is applied. Adding the Army Adjustment to the Challenge Adjustment indicates a result of +11. However, the maximum adjustment is +2 from this stage. The expedition adds +2 steps to their resolution roll.

**Designer’s Note:** Why does the Army Adjustment use Battle Rating instead of basing everything on experience value? To reflect the differences that equipment, training, and organization make. Light infantry and heavy infantry are both composed of normal men with an XP value of 5, but on the battlefield, the better training and equipment of heavy infantry makes them significantly more effective, reflected in their higher Battle Rating. For battles where both sides are trained military and would theoretically benefit from these sorts of things equally, ***Domains at War*** or one of its subsystems may be a better way to resolve the fight than Abstract Wilderness.

## Abstract Wilderness Encounter Resolution

The interaction between **expedition level** and **monster level** determines the **base difficulty** and **base modifier** to the resolution roll. Consult the table below; find your expedition level in the row for the monster level. (See below if your expedition level is not listed in the row for the monster level.)

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Base Resolution Modifier** | | | | | | | |
|  | **-8** | **-4** | **-2** | **0** | **+2** | **+4** | **+8** |
| **Monster Level** | **Apocalyptic** | **Horrifying** | **Dangerous** | **Accessible** | **Easy** | **Simple** | **Effortless** |
| **1** | - | - | - | 1 | 2-3 | 4-5 | 6-7 |
| **2** | - | - | 1 | 2-3 | 4-5 | 6-7 | 8-9 |
| **3** | - | 1 | 2-3 | 4-5 | 6-7 | 8-9 | 10-11 |
| **4** | 1 | 2-3 | 4-5 | 6-7 | 8-9 | 10-11 | 12-13 |
| **5** | 2-3 | 4-5 | 6-7 | 8-9 | 10-11 | 12-13 | 14 |
| **6** | 4-5 | 6-7 | 8-9 | 10-11 | 12-13 | 14 | - |

### Under- or Over-Strength Parties

If the expedition level is too high or low to appear in the monster level row, move up or down a number of rows until you find the expedition level. Consider the difficulty to be an additional number of columns to the right (easier) for each row you moved down, or an additional number of columns to the left (harder) for each row you moved up. This can also be expressed as a +1 adjustment for each row you moved down, or a -1 adjustment for each row you moved up. A +1 adjustment means to move one column to the right, while a -1 adjustment means to move one column to the left.

### Challenge and Army Adjustments

Once you have found your base difficulty, it is time to apply your other adjustments.

* Add together the Challenge Adjustment of the encounter and the expedition’s Army Adjustment. If the sum is +2 or lower, adjust the difficulty a number of steps equal to the sum. A positive number indicates a number of columns to the right (easier), while a negative number indicates a number of columns to the left (harder). If the sum is greater than +2, apply a +2 adjustment instead.
* If an expedition has force marched or otherwise become fatigued, apply a -1 adjustment penalty for each day of rest missed. This shifts the difficulty a number of columns to the left (harder).
* If penalties would give you a difficulty harder than Apocalyptic (-8), each further -1 adjustment increases the modifier by -8. That is, if you already have a -8 modifier and have -1 more adjustment, your modifier is -16. If it is -2 beyond Apocalyptic, it is -24, and so on. (Given the way the table works, there is not really a point in calculating modifiers worse than -24. -24 indicates a guaranteed Catastrophic result.)

In no case may you have a difficulty easier than Effortless (+8), regardless of how high your expedition level, Army Adjustment, or other adjustments are. Even the mightiest can be brought down by bad luck.

### The Resolution Table

Once the final difficulty is known, roll 1d8 + 1d12 on the resolution table, adding the modifier for that difficulty.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Abstract Wilderness Resolution** | |
| **Roll (1d8 + 1d12)** | **Result** |
| 2- | Catastrophic |
| 3-5 | Dreadful |
| 6-8 | Unsatisfactory |
| 9-12 | Indifferent |
| 13-16 | Satisfactory |
| 17-19 | Excellent |
| 20+ | Stupendous |

**Catastrophic**: On a Catastrophic result, every participant in the expedition is slain. A new expedition can be sent to retrieve their bodies; if the new expedition successfully finds their corpses and defeats any monsters that may be guarding them, they can retrieve the bodies of the fallen.(They receive experience as normal for encounters defeated.)

**Dreadful:** On a Dreadful result, (1d6) x participants (times scaling modifier) participants suffer mortal wounds. No treasure is earned from this set of encounters.

**Unsatisfactory:** On an unsatisfactory result, (1d4-1) x (scaling modifier) participants suffer mortal wounds. Only 50% of normal treasure is earned from this encounters.

**Indifferent:** On an indifferent result, (1d3-2) x (scaling modifier) participants suffer mortal wounds. 100% of normal treasure is earned from this encounters.

**Satisfactory:**- On a satisfactory result, (1d4-3) x (scaling modifier) participants suffer mortal wounds. 125% of normal treasure is earned from this encounters.

**Excellent:** On an excellent result, (1d6-5) x (scaling modifier) participants suffer mortal wounds. 150% of normal treasure is earned from this encounter.

**Stupendous:** On a stupendous result, no participants suffer mortal wounds, and 200% of normal treasure is earned from this encounter.

### Scaling Modifier

In the wilderness, expeditions tend to be larger than parties in dungeons. In addition, military units might suffer casualties as well. A large expedition suffers more mortal wounds than a small party would. Add up the total number of participants in the expedition (all leveled adventurers, plus the number of platoon-scale units that contributed to Army Adjustment). Divide this number by six to find the **scaling modifier**. Multiply the number of mortal wounds rolled by the scaling modifier. Do not round the scaling modifier; instead, round the modified number of mortal wounds. Round fractions of 0.5 or greater up, and fractions of 0.49 or less down.

EXAMPLE: An expedition consisting of eight leveled characters and six platoon-scale units rolls a result of Unsatisfactory on their resolution roll. Rolling 1d4-1, they roll a 4, indicating a base of three mortal wounds. However, because there are fourteen participants in the expedition, their scaling modifier is (14/6) = 2.33. Three mortal wounds times 2.33 indicates that the expedition suffers seven mortal wounds.

When one or more expedition participants suffer a mortal wound, determine which participant was injured randomly. When randomly determining which participant suffered the wound, no participant can suffer a second wound unless every participant has already suffered one. An adventurer who suffers a mortal wound can no longer participate in the expedition until they recover. Roll on the Mortal Wounds - Savage table using only the adventurer's Constitution, and HD, and equipment modifiers as adjustments to the d20. An adventurer whose mortal wound requires that he be healed to 1 HP dies unless the party can heal the character or bring him back to civilization in the time allotted.

If a unit suffers a mortal wound, 50% of the unit members are casualties. If the resolution result was Indifferent or better, 50% of the casualties will recover in one week. If the resolution result was worse than Indifferent, all the casualties are slain.

In addition, armies in the field are always in danger of attrition and casualties even in a won battle. After the resolution roll, each unwounded unit that benefited the Army Adjustment of the expedition must make a successful Death saving throw or suffer 5% casualties. Casualties will recover or die, as above, based on whether or not the resolution roll was at least Indifferent.

Units that have suffered casualties and are under-strength contribute less to Army Adjustment. Reduce their effective Battle Rating by their percentage under-strength. Round up to the nearest 0.5 BR. Units can be combined if sufficient casualties were suffered.

## Abstract Wilderness Encounters Evasion

An expedition may attempt to evade a wilderness encounter rather than face it. Resolve the evasion attempt using the mechanics described in the ***ACKS Revised Rulebook***(p. XX). All of the various monster abilities, character proficiencies, and class powers that would affect a wilderness evasion throw apply to this evasion throw normally. You can also apply any situational modifiers you deem appropriate. The expedition can take advantage of the Forlorn Hope and Sauve Qui Peut mechanics if desired.

If the expedition successfully evades, they get away. They receive no experience or treasure, but survive without any casualties. If they fail to evade, they have been caught, and must face the encounter. If the expedition splits up into smaller groups, any of the groups that fail collectively share the encounter, which is assumed to occur before they managed to split up.

## Treasure and Experience

An expedition gains experience for each encounter that they defeat. As normal, each player character in the expedition receives one share, while each henchman receives one-half share, of any realized experience. If the expedition is composed entirely of henchmen or other such hirelings, they still only receive half XP from combat. Troops in units receive 75 x (monster level / expedition level) XP from combat each.

If the encounter was against a monster lair, the monsters will have treasure. If you want, you can follow the standard rules for generating treasure, rolling on the treasure type table for the monsters to determine the amount of coin, gems, jewelry, and special treasure. Alternatively, you can simply assume that a lair has treasure with a gp value equal to four times the experience value of the lair.

### Magic Items

If the monsters have treasure, magic items might be present. You can follow the standard rules for generating magic items or simply consult the table below. For each full amount of the gold listed per roll, roll once on the listed treasure type for magical items. Disregard all other possible results of the treasure type; all coin, jewelry, gems, and so on are already included in the gp value of the treasure.

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Magical Items** | | |
| **Monster Level** | **GP Per Roll** | **Treasure Type** |
| 1 | 1000 | D |
| 2 | 1250 | E |
| 3 | 3250 | I |
| 4 | 6000 | L |
| 5 | 22000 | Q |
| 6 | 45000 | R |

EXAMPLE: An expedition has cleared a lair consisting of a Monster Level 4 encounter of challenge modifier -4. The encounter was worth 5,000 XP, meaning that the lair had 20,000 gp of treasure. Consulting the table for level 4, the Judge sees that he should roll for magic items in treasure type L once for each 6,000 full GP. In this case, that means three rolls of treasure type L. He does not roll for gems, jewelry, or coin.

### Allocating Treasure and XP

If the expedition is composed of a mix of PCs (or other similar employers) and henchmen, treasure is split as it normally would be, according to whatever share of treasure the henchmen are normally entitled to and whatever share of treasure military units would expect from spoils of war. XP is gained from realized treasure as normal in such a fashion.

If the expedition consists entirely of henchmen and followers, treasure is split as above, but the absent employer(s) and henchmen all receive a full share each. Treasure gained in this fashion for absent employers is considered a campaign activity, granting XP for that portion which exceeds the employer’s GP threshold as normal.

EXAMPLE: An expedition has recovered 20,000gp of treasure. The expedition consists of the bladedancer Phaedra and her six henchmen. Treasure is split between [1 + (6/2)] = 4 shares. Each share is worth 20,000gp / 5 = 4,000gp. Therefore Phaedra earns 4,000gp and each henchman earns 2,000gp. If Phaedra were not present, treasure would be split between (1 + 6) = 7 shares. Phaedra and each of her six henchmen would earn 2,857gp.

## Optional Rules

Although the core rules described above will work perfectly fine, a variety of optional rules can assist in bookkeeping, or help you dial in your desired level of complexity and abstraction. Some of these optional rules will decrease complexity, while others will increase it.

In addition to those rules listed here, any optional rule from Abstract Dungeons can be used in Abstract Wilderness. Though some may not be directly applicable, such as Travel Time to Dungeon, others like Abstract Leveling and Finding Monster Parts can be used without any modification needed.

### Leading from the Rear

Some adventurers may be unwilling to bravely take the fore and charge directly into combat, leading their army behind them. Granted, such a plan is much more likely to get them killed, and so there are some very noticeable benefits to leading from the rear.

If an adventurer wishes to reduce the chance that they will be injured in combat, they may choose to lead from the rear. An adventurer leading from the rear counts as two levels lower (to a minimum of 0) when calculating expedition level. However, when resolving expedition participants who suffer mortal wounds, an adventurer leading from the rear will not suffer a mortal wound unless all platoon-scale units have suffered one first.

EXAMPLE: An expedition has a total of 43 levels of leveled characters and six platoon-scale units. Three of the adventurers leading the expedition choose to lead from the rear, reducing the total effective levels by six, from 43 to 37. This reduces the expedition level from 7 to 6. Later, after a wilderness encounter, a resolution roll indicates that five participants suffer mortal wounds. Because there are five mortal wounds to parcel out and six platoon-scale units, the adventurers who led from the rear are safe. If there had been seven mortal wounds, it would have been possible (if unlikely) for them to suffer one.

### Multiple Rolls for Multiple Encounters

Instead of rolling once to resolve all encounters when multiple encounters are faced, you can instead choose to roll for each individually. When doing so, each roll past the first applies a stacking -1 step penalty to the resolution roll.

EXAMPLE: An expedition faces three encounters in a day. The Judge chooses to roll for each individually. The first encounter has no modifier, and is resolved normally. The second modifier has a -1 penalty, in addition to any changes in expedition level and Army Adjustment that may have occurred from the first encounter (as a result of casualties or mortal wounds). The third encounter has a -2 penalty, in addition to any changes that may have occurred as a result of the prior two.

The average results of either the single roll or multiple rolls are nearly identical, and as a result, it is left to your discretion which to use. The single roll was chosen as the default in order to cut down on complexity and time required to resolve.

### Situational Modifiers and Adjustments to Wilderness Resolution

In addition to the situational modifiers described in Abstract Dungeons, which apply a flat modifier to the resolution roll, situational adjustments can apply difficulty step bonuses or penalties in Abstract Wilderness. Any situational modifier or adjustment is at your discretion.

For instance, you could roll encounter distance for an encounter; since the majority of wilderness encounters have weak ranged attacks, you might decide to give a bonus to an expedition armed with archers if the encounter is at a very long range. The vast majority of any such situational adjustments or modifiers should be plus or minus one (+/- ±1), but an adjustment or modifier of plus or minus two (+/- ±2) might be applied for extreme situations.

### Splitting Encounters

When an expedition finds a wilderness encounter with a very difficult Challenge Adjustment (-4 or worse), the encounter might qualify to be split up into sub-encounters. This could represent, e.g. a sortie into a sprawling beastman village, where only a fraction of the enemy can confront the adventurers at a time.

Any encounter with a Challenge Adjustment of -4 or worse has a 75% chance that it can be split into 1d4+1 separate sub-encounters, with a minimum Challenge Adjustment of -2. Should the encounter not divide appropriately, split it into fewer sub-encounters. At your discretion, you can split the encounter up manually based on the context and circumstances.

EXAMPLE: An expedition encounters a huge beastman village, a dangerous encounter with a Challenge Adjustment of -7. The Judge decides it can be split up, and rolls 1d4+1 for the number of separate sub-encounters. He rolls a 4. The Challenge Adjustment of -7 cannot be divided by 4 without violating the minimum, so he reduces it to 3 sub-encounters, one with Challenge Adjustment -3 and two with Challenge Adjustment of -2.

Although an encounter is split up into sub-encounters, all of the sub-encounters are resolved with a single resolution roll. The base resolution adjustment is calculated based on the most difficult Challenge Adjustment of any sub-encounter. Then a penalty of -1 step adjustment is applied per sub-encounter. This penalty is applied as a situational adjustment, after the Army Adjustment and Challenge Adjustment have been accounted for already.

EXAMPLE: The expedition now faces three sub-encounters of monster level 3 and Challenge Adjustments -3, -2, and -2. Since -3 is the most difficult Challenge Adjustment, that sets the overall Challenge Adjustment. The expedition level is 9 and the expedition’s modified Army Adjustment is 3. Cross-referencing an expedition level of 9 with a monster level of 3 on the Base Resolution table, the Judge sees that the base difficulty is now Simple (+4). Adding together the Army Adjustment (3) and the Challenge Adjustment (-3) yields 0, so he does not need to shift columns. However, because there are three encounters, the Judge does need to shift the difficulty by 3 steps to the right. Consulting the Base Resolution table, he sees the difficulty is now Dangerous (-2) ; therefore Judge rolls once at a difficulty of Dangerous (-2) to determine the combined results of all three encounters.

What if the encounter couldn’t be split up? In that case, the base difficulty would still have been Simple (+4) but the Challenge Adjustment would have been -7. After adding the Challenge Adjustment (-7) to the Army Adjustment (+3) to yield -4, he would shift the difficulty by four columns leftward, making it Horrifying (-4).

**Designer’s Note:** Because wilderness encounters cannot be easily categorized by difficulty like dungeon levels, we needed a way to determine how dangerous each encounter would be. This is the purpose of the Challenge Adjustment. The Challenge Adjustment relies on the Abstract Dungeon rules and their generalization of the level of danger. An average dungeon encounter of a given level has a particular XP value, derived by averaging together all such possible encounters. This value is the amount given for Challenge Adjustment 0 as seen in the Treasure and XP section. Since we know generally how dangerous this encounter is, it can be used as the base. Encounters with a higher XPV carry greater danger, and therefore have a Challenge Adjustment, based off of the ratio between the specific encounter’s XPV and the average encounter XPV of that level.

Unlike in dungeons, in wilderness encounters, parties have a tendency to bring back-up in large amounts. This required a method to calculate the contribution of an army. Battle Rating was the obvious choice. For example, say 90 orc bowmen are encountered. This is 3 platoon-scale units of orc bowmen, a total BR of 4.5. 90 orcs is also 900 XPV, of monster level 1; Challenge Adjustment -5. Thus, it requires 5 BR to negate their Challenge Adjustment, which is close to their own 4.5 BR.

Consider also a venerable dragon; a level 6 encounter of Challenge Adjustment -1. A venerable dragon has a BR of 38. An expedition that brings along 38 BR of ordinary units must divide their 38 BR by 32 (for the five levels of difference), giving a result of 1.25 which rounds up down to 1, negating the dragon’s Challenge Adjustment.

It does not always line up perfectly, but the comparison is fairly close, and allows a relatively easy way to calculate their effectiveness. The division for different levels is necessary because the amount of XPV per encounter scales up with level; a level 6 encounter of Challenge Adjustment -1 is much more XPV than a level 1 encounter of Challenge Adjustment -1, and would have a much higher BR.

# PART IV: CUSTOMIZATION

# Chapter 12: Custom Classes

## Creating a Custom Class

The core, campaign, and racial classes available in *ACKS Imperial Imprint* can create characters that fill the most common and popular archetypes of myth, legend, film, and literature. The variety of options for proficiencies, spells, spell signatures, alignment, and such can allow for fine-tuning characters, such that a fighter can be easily be a pirate or a mage can easily be a necromancer. Nevertheless, sometimes a campaign setting or a player’s character concept will demand a set of game mechanics that no combination of existing class powers and proficiencies can offer. In this case, you can use the custom class rules to create unique classes for your campaign and players.

To create a custom class of the human race, follow these ten steps:

1. Start by allocating a total of 4 **build points** across each of 5 class categories: Hit Die, Fighting, Thievery, Divine, and Arcane. See the **Build Points and Class Categories** section, below.
2. Determine the class Hit Dice per level based on its Hit Die Value. See the **Hit Die Value** section.
3. Select weapons, armor, and fighting style proficiencies appropriate to the chosen Fighting Value. If desired, trade in selections of weapons, armor, or fighting style proficiencies in exchange for a choice of one or more custom powers. If the class has Fighting Value 2 or higher, note down the experience point cost for the custom powers. See the **Fighting Value** section.
4. Select thief skills appropriate to the chosen Thievery Value. If desired, trade in thief skills for custom powers. See the **Thievery Value** section.
5. Note down any spellcasting abilities appropriate to the chosen Divine or Arcane Values. If desired, trade in the ability to rebuke undead for one or more custom powers. See the **Divine Value** and **Arcane Value** sections, respectively.
6. Determine the custom class’s saving throw progression based on its build point allocation. Use this information to determine magic items useable by the class, proficiencies, hit points after 9th level, and prime requisites. See the **Saving Throw Progress** section.
7. Determine what type of stronghold and followers the custom class will receive at 9th level based on its build point allocation. Select a 5th level bonus power if appropriate. See the **Stronghold and Followers** section.
8. Final the selection of the class’s custom powers. If desired, trade in a selection of skills or powers at 1st level for a larger selection of multiple powers unlocked at a higher level. See the **Custom Powers** section.
9. Calculate the experience points required to advance to 2nd level and each level thereafter. Write these values down, assigning a title to each level appropriate to the theme of the custom class. See the **Experience Points per Level** section.
10. Name the character class. Detail its role in the game world and explain why members of the class become adventurers.

Note that Demi-Human Classes, discussed later under **Custom Demi-Human Classes**, are built using the same steps, but have more build points and categories.

## Build Points and Class Categories

Creating a custom class is primarily process of allocating **build points** to various **class categories** that define the strengths and weaknesses of the class, and then making various choices that flow from the build point allocation.

All Human Classes have **4** (**four**) build points to spend on five class categories: **Hit Dice**, **Fighting**, **Thievery**, **Divine**, and **Arcane**. Each category is allocated between 0 and 4 points. The final total spent on the class *must* equal 4 build points. The Hit Dice class category determines the Hit Die the class uses, while the Fighting, Thievery, Divine, and Arcane class categories grant abilities associated with the core *ACKS* classes of fighter, thief, crusader, and mage. (While explorer and venturer are deemed core classes in ***ACKS II***, they do not have an associated class category value, and are actually hybrids of Fighting and Thievery.)

Within each category, there are sometimes opportunities to make **trade-offs** after build points have been allocated**.** Trade-offs allow characters to buy **custom powers** such as the elven nightblade’s Acrobatics or the bard’s Inspire Courage ability. Custom powers are powers which are not present in the core four classes (crusader, fighter, mage, thief) and they can only be selected by making trade-offs. Trade-offs can be complex. When creating an initial set of Custom Classes, it may be helpful to ignore the trade-off options initially.

Note that certain values, which appear in parentheses, exceed the abilities normally found in *ACKS Imperial Imprint* and similar games*.* While we believe the values below are balanced, these selections could and should be prohibited in a given campaign by any Judge which feels they would disrupt play.

In general, any system of build points is susceptible to abuse and you must carefully review all custom classes for balance. Just because something *can* be built doesn’t mean it *should* be built or *must* be allowed in play.

## Hit Dice Value

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Value** | **Hit Die** | **Mortal Wounds** | **XP Cost** |
| 4 | (d12) | +8 | 2000 |
| 3 | (d10) | +6 | 1500 |
| 2 | d8 | +4 | 1000 |
| 1 | d6 | +2 | 500 |
| 0 | d4 | 0 | 0 |

The Hit Dice Value determines the Hit Die the class uses from 1st to 9th level. (A class’s hit points increase after 9th level based on its saving throw progression). It also provides a modifier to the class’s rolls on the Mortal Wounds table when he is reduced to 0 hp or less.

Assign from 0 to 4 build points to the class’s Hit Dice Value, noting down the appropriate Hit Die and the XP cost.

EXAMPLE: The standard fighter was built with Hit Die Value 2. Fighters roll 1d8 for hit points from 1st to 9th level.

## Fighting Value

The Fighting Value determines the class’s effectiveness in combat, including the rate at which the class’s attack throws improve; the weapons , armor, and fighting style proficiencies that the class is trained to use; and any special combat abilities. Assign 0 to 4 build points to the class’s Fighting Value, noting down the appropriate abilities and XP cost. If 1 build point is assigned, choose from either 1a (Thief) or 1b (Crusader). The table below summarizes the different capabilities at each build point.

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Value** | **Fighting**  **Capability** | **Attack**  **Throws** | **Weapon**  **Proficiencies** | **Armor**  **Proficiencies** | **Fighting**  **Style Prof.** | **Damage**  **Bonus** | **Cleaves** | **XP**  **Cost** |
| 4 | (Hero) | +3 per 2 levels | Unrestricted | Heavy | 3 | +1 per 3 levels | 1 per level | 2000 |
| 3 | (Monster) | +2 per 2 levels | Unrestricted | Heavy | 3 | +1 per 3 levels | 1 per level | 1500 |
| 2 | Fighter | +2 per 3 levels | Unrestricted | Heavy | 3 | +1 per 3 levels | 1 per level | 1000 |
| 1b | Thief | +2 per 4 levels | Broad | Light | 2 | None | 1 per 2 levels | 500 |
| 1a | Crusader | +2 per 4 levels | Narrow | Heavy | 2 | None | 1 per 2 levels | 500 |
| 0 | Mage | +2 per 6 levels | Restricted | None | 1 | None | None | 0 |

### Weapon Proficiencies

A class’s selection of weapon proficiencies can be restricted, narrow, broad, or unscripted. The rules below explain the options available at each selection level.

**Restricted:** The class can select proficiency in any 4 of the following 10 specific weapons: (i) bola, (ii) cestus, (iii) club; (iv) dagger, (v) dart; (vi) net, (vii) sap; (viii) sling, (ix) staff, (x) whip.

EXAMPLE: The standard mage (Fighting Value 0) received a restricted selection of weapons. The mage’s choices were club, dagger, dart, and staff.

**Narrow:** The class can select proficiency with any 2 of the following 7 narrow categories of weapons: (i) axes; (ii) any bows and crossbows; (iii) any flails, hammers, and maces; (iv) any swords and daggers; (v) any spears and pole arms; (vi) any bolas, cestus, nets, saps, slings, staff-slings, and whips; or (vii) any combination of 3 weapons. When selection option vii, the class can only be proficient in composite bow or long bow if also shortbow and the class can only be proficient in spear or pole arm if also proficient in javelin.

EXAMPLE: The standard crusader, bladedancer, and dwarven craftpriest (all Fighting Value 1a) received a narrow selection of weapons. The crusader’s choices were flails/hammers/maces and bolas/cestus/nets/rocks/saps/slings/staffs/staff-slings/whips. In contrast, the bladedancer chose swords/daggers and spears/pole arms; while the dwarven craftpriest chose axes and flails/hammers/maces.

**Broad:** The class can select proficiency with any 2 of the following 6 broad choices: (i) any tiny, small, or medium melee weapons, (ii) any medium or large melee weapons, (iii) any axes, flails, hammers, and maces; (iv) any swords, daggers, spears, and polearms; (v) all missile weapons; and (vi) any combination of 5 weapons. When selection option vi, the class can only be proficient in composite bow or long bow if also proficient in shortbow and the class can only be proficient in spear or pole arm if also proficient in javelin.

EXAMPLE: The standard thief (Fighting Value 1b) received a broad selection of weapons. The thief’s choices were all tiny, small, and medium melee weapons and all missile weapons.

**Unrestricted:** The class has proficiency in all weapons.

### Armor Proficiencies

A class’s selection of armor proficiencies can range from none to heavy. The rules below explain the options available at each selection level.

**None:** The class has no armor proficiencies. In addition, the class cannot select the weapon and shield fighting style proficiency.

**Very Light:** The class has armor proficiency with very light armor.

**Light:** The class has armor proficiency with light and very light armor.

**Medium:** The class has armor proficiency with medium, light, and very light armor.

**Heavy:** The class has armor proficiency with heavy, medium, light, and very light armor.

### Fighting Style Proficiencies

There are five fighting style proficiencies:

* *Missile Weapon:* Fighting while wielding a missile weapon in one, both, or each hand (depending on the weapon).
* *Single Weapon:* Fighting while wielding a single tiny, small, or medium melee weapon.
* *Dual Weapon:* Fighting while wielding a tiny, small, or medium melee weapon in each hand.
* *Two-Handed Weapon:* Fighting while wielding a medium or large melee weapon in both hands.
* *Weapon and Shield:* Fighting while wielding a small, tiny, or medium weapon or missile weapon in one hand and a shield in the other. Classes which lack this style do not gain benefit from shields.

All classes are proficient in the single weapon and missile weapon styles, which are mandatory when creating a class. The other three fighting styles are optional. Based on Fighting value, a class might be proficient in one, two, or three of the optional fighting styles.

Note that fighting style proficiency is distinct from weapon proficiency and both are required to avoid the non-proficiency penalty so when building a class, be sure they match up. For instance, a class that has weapon proficiency in great axe, pole arm, and two-handed sword will also need to have fighting style proficiency in two-handed weapon style.

### Fighting Value Capabilities

The rules below define the capabilities for each Fighting Value.

**Fighting 0 (Mage):** The class advances in attack throws by two points every six levels. The class has a **restricted** selection of weapon proficiencies, determined when the class is created. The class has no armor proficiencies. It is proficient in single weapon and missile weapon fighting style, plus either two weapons or two-handed weapons. The class cannot perform cleaves.

EXAMPLE: The standard mage was built with Fighting Value 0. A mage cannot wear armor and may only use clubs, daggers, darts, and slings. A mage is proficient in two-handed weapon style (e.g., staffs).

**Fighting 1a (Crusader):** The class advances in attack throws by two points every four levels. The class is only proficient in a **narrow** selection of weapons, determined when the class is created. The class has heavy, medium, light, and very light armor proficiency. The class has single weapon and missile weapon fighting style, plus two of the following three styles: two weapons, weapons and shields, and two-handed weapons. The class can perform one cleave attack per two levels.

EXAMPLE: The standard crusader was built with Fighting Value 1a. A crusader is proficient in all armor. A crusader is proficient in restricted to only use blunt weapons. A crusader’s fighting styles are weapons and shield and two-handed weapons.

**Fighting 1b (Thief):** The class advances in attack throws by two points every four levels. The class has a **broad** selection of weapon proficiencies. The class has light and very light armor proficiency. The class has single weapon and missile weapon fighting style, plus two of the following three selections from among the fighting styles: two weapons, weapons and shields, and two-handed weapons. The class can perform one cleave attack per two levels.

EXAMPLE: The standard thief was built with Fighting Value 1b. A thief may use any one-handed or missile weapons, but may only wear light or very light armor. A thief’s fighting styles are two weapons and two-handed weapons. (Even though a thief cannot fight with a two-handed weapon such as a pole-arm, he could still fight two-handed using a one-handed weapon such as a sword.)

**Fighting 2 (Fighter):** The class advances in attack throws by two points every three levels. The class has proficiency in all weapons, all armor, and all fighting styles. The class gains +1 to damage rolls at level 1, and +1 every three levels thereafter. The class may perform one cleave attack per level.

**Fighting 3 (Monster):** The class advances in attack throws by two points every two levels. The class has proficiency in all weapons, all armor, and all fighting styles. The class gains +1 to damage rolls at level 1, and +1 every three levels thereafter. The class may perform one cleave attack per level.

**Fighting 4 (Hero):** The class advances in attack throws by three points every two levels. The class has proficiency in all weapons, all armor, and all fighting styles. The class gains +1 to damage rolls at level 1, and +1 every three levels thereafter. The class may perform one cleave attack per level.

### Fighting Value Trade-Offs

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Trade-Off** | **Benefit** |
| Reduce armor selection from Heavy to Medium | 1 custom power |
| Reduce armor selection from Medium to Light | 1 custom power |
| Reduce armor selection from Light to Very Light | 1 custom power |
| Reduce armor selection from Very Light to None | 1 custom power |
| Reduce weapon selection from Unrestricted to Broad | 1 custom power |
| Reduce weapon selection from Broad to Narrow | 2 custom powers |
| Reduce weapon selection from Narrow to Restricted | 1 custom power |
| Eliminate one fighting style | 1 custom power |
| Eliminate fighter damage bonus (melee or missile) | 1 custom power |
| Eliminate fighter damage bonus (both) | 2 custom powers |

A class more may voluntarily trade off its armor proficiencies, fighting style proficiencies, weapon selections, or damage bonus in exchange for bonus **custom powers**. Custom powers are explained in detail later in these rules. In general, custom powers include any class proficiency, any general proficiency, or any single non-spellcasting non-thief power possessed by a character class. All trade-offs are cumulative, so trading from, e.g., heavy armor to medium armor, and then medium armor to light armor, gives a benefit of 2 custom powers.

EXAMPLE: The standard bladedancerwas built with Fighting Value of 1a. Before trade-offs, the bladedancer had two fighting style proficiencies (two weapons and two-handed weapons), heavy armor proficiency, and narrow weapon selection (swords/daggers, spears/pole arms). The bladedancer then made two trade-offs, reducing its armor selection from heavy to medium, and then again from medium to light. In exchange, the bladedancer received the benefit of two custom powers – the class’s initiative bonus and AC bonus. Note that we could also have built the bladedancer with a Fighting Value of 1b (Thief). The bladedancer would then have started with a broad weapon selection and a narrow armor selection. The trade-off from broad to narrow weapon selection would provide the benefit of two additional custom powers.

**Level Lock Trade-Off:** A class may trade one or more initial custom powers for custom powers unlocked at a later date. In general, one skill at 1st level can be given up for two skills unlocked at a higher level. See the **Custom Power Trade-Offs** section for more details.

### Fighting Value Trade-Off Experience Point Penalty

A class with a Fighting Value of 2 or greater that makes a weapon selection trade-off increases the experience point cost of its Fighting Value by 250 XP per custom power gained. This is because once a class has a Fighting Value of 2 or higher, it has so many weapon selections available to it that it can specialize without suffering much loss of effectiveness. Armor, damage, and fighting style trade-offs do not increase XP cost.

EXAMPLE: The standard explorerhas a Fighting Value of 2 (Fighter). Before trade-offs, the explorer had unlimited weapon and armor selection and had all three fighting styles (two weapons, weapons and shields, and two-handed weapons). The explorer then made two trade-offs, reducing its armor selection from unrestricted to broad and its weapon selection from unrestricted to broad. In exchange, the explorer received the benefit of two custom powers – Animal Reflexes and Alertness. However, because the explorer has a Fighting Value of 2 or more, the experience point cost of its Fighting Value is increased by 250XP from its weapon selection trade-off.

## Thievery Value

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Value** | **Thievery** | **XP Cost** |
| 4 | 16 Skills | 1,000 |
| 3 | 12 Skills | 750 |
| 2 | 8 Skills | 500 |
| 1 | 4 Skills | 250 |
| 0 | none | 0 |

The Thievery Value determines the class’s access to thief skills. Assign 0 to 4 build points to the class’s Thievery Value. Then note down the appropriate skill choices and the XP cost.

There are thirteen thief skills available: (1) Backstabbing, (2) Climbing, (3) Deciphering, (4) Hiding), (5) Listening, (6) Lockpicking, (7) Pickpocketing, (8) Searching, (9) Scrollreading, (10) Shadowy Senses, (11) Sneaking, (12) Trapbreaking, (13) Jack of All Trades. Backstabbing counts as two skills.

### Thievery Value Trade-Offs

**Custom Power Trade-Off:** A class may choose trade one or more thief skills for one custom power each. Custom powers are explained in detail later in these rules. In general, custom powers include any class proficiency, any general proficiency, or single non-spell casting power possessed by any character class. You can limit particular combinations of custom powers at his discretion to maintain game balance.

EXAMPLE: The standard explorerhas a Thievery Value of 1. The explorer traded all of its thief skills to acquire four custom powers (Alertness, Ambushing, Evasion, Natural Stealth).

**Level Lock Trade-Off:** A class may trade one or more initial thief skills for skills or custom powers unlocked at a higher level. In general, one skill at 1st level can be given up for two skills unlocked at a higher level. See the **Custom Power Trade-Offs** section for more details.

EXAMPLE: The standard thief has a Thievery Value of 3, granting it 12 thief skills. The standard thief selected Backstabbing (counts as 2 skills), Climbing, Hiding, Listening, Lockpicking, Pickpocketing, Searching, Shadowy Senses, Sneaking, and Trapbreaking. The standard thief then exchanged its final skill selection for Decipher at 4th level and Scrollreading at 10th level.

### Limitations on Thief Skill Usage

Regardless of a class’s Fighting Value, certain thief skills require that the character be in leather armor or lighter and be free of a shield. The skills are: Backstabbing, Hiding, Pickpocketing, and Sneaking

EXAMPLE: The standard assassin has a Thievery Value of 1. This makes the class eligible for four thief skills. The assassin chose Backstabbing, Hiding, and Sneaking. Although the standard assassin is proficient in medium armor, these skills can only be used when the assassin is wearing leather armor or lighter and free of a shield.

At your discretion, other custom powers may also be limited to characters in leather armor or lighter, or have other requirements he deems necessary for balance.

## Divine Value

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Value** | **Divine** | **XP Cost** |
| 4 | 150% Power | 2,000 |
| 3 | 133% Power | 1,000 |
| 2 | 100% Power | 500 |
| 1 | 50% Power | 250 |
| 0 | No Divine Spellcasting | 0 |

The Divine Value determines the extent of the class’s divine spellcasting abilities, if any. Assign 0 to 4 build points to the class’s Divine Value, noting down the appropriate powers and the XP cost.

**Divine 1:** A Divine Value of 1 gives the class the ability to rebuke undead, casts spells, and engage in magical research like a crusader, but at a diminished effective caster level relative to class level. The class uses its effective caster level for purposes of level-dependent spell ranges, durations, and damage. The class’s divine spell repertoire is based on a spell list of 5 spells per level.

**Divine 2:** A Divine Value of 2 points gives the class the ability to rebuke undead, cast spells, and engage in magical research as a crusader. The class’s divine spell repertoire is based on a spell list of 10 spells per level.

**Divine 3:** A Divine Value of 3 gives the class the ability to rebuke undead and cast spells as a crusader but with the class’s spells per level increased by 33%. The class uses its class level for all level-dependent spell ranges, durations, and damages; these are not increased. The class’s divine spell repertoire is based on a spell list of 12 spells per level.

**Divine 4:** A Divine Value of 4 gives the class the ability to rebuke undead and cast spells as a crusader, but with the class’s spells per level increased by 50%. The class uses its class level for all level-dependent spell ranges, durations, and damages. The class’s divine spell repertoire is based on a spell list of 15 spells per level.

When creating a custom class with divine spellcasting abilities, be sure to build a spell repertoire appropriate to the class. Select from 5-15 divine spells from the Divine Spell List in *ACKS Imperial Imprint*. The spells selected should reflect the flavor of the class and be balanced relative to other similar classes.

### Divine Spell Progressions

The following tables shows the spell progression and caster level by class level of a divine class with Divine 1, 2, 3, or 4.

| **14** | 6 | 6 | 6 | 6 | 5 | 5 | 14 |

### Divine Value Codes

All custom classes with a Divine Value of 1 or more must have a code of behavior. The higher the Divine Value, the more restrictive the behavior code will be.

**Divine 1:** The class’s code will be similar to the commandments on a lay member of a religious faith, such as not to commit adultery, to follow minor dietary restrictions, and to engage in prayer on worship days, etc. A knight’s chivalric vows would also qualify.

**Divine 2:** The code will add additional rules to an extent similar to that imposed on clergy, such as monogamy or celibacy, restrictions on dress, bans on certain indulgences, strict dietary rules, daily prayer, etc. The bladedancer, crusader, dwarven craftpriest, and shaman have such codes.

**Divine 3:** The code will require a highly restrictive set of behaviors akin to those of a monastic order, including vows of chastity, obedience, and so on.

**Divine 4:** The class’s code will be similar to that of Divine Value 3, but with an additional restriction such as pacifism, silence, or poverty. The priestess class has such a code.

A code of behavior need not demand virtue – a class’s code could dictate strange or vile behavior if appropriate to the class’s concept. For example, a cultist class devoted to chaotic powers might require ritual sacrifices, or use of strange drugs. You, as Judge, are the ultimate authority on the permissibility of any class’s code.

### Divine Value Trade-Offs

A custom class with a Divine Value of 1 or more may voluntarily trade off its ability to rebuke undead in exchange for custom powers. The custom class gains 1 custom power for every point allocated to Divine Value.

A class which trades off its ability to rebuke undead loses the ability to perform necromantic research at 11th level.

**Level Lock Trade-Off:** A selection of custom powers received from a Divine Value trade-off may be exchanged for a larger selection at a higher level of experience. See the **Custom Power Trade-Offs** section for more details.

EXAMPLE: The shaman class has a Divine Value of 2. The shaman class traded off its ability to rebuke undead in exchange for 2 custom powers. It then exchanged these 2 custom powers for a selection of 3 custom powers at 3rd, 5th, and 7th level.

## Arcane Value

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Value** | **Arcane** | **XP Cost** |
| 4 | 100% Arcane Power | 2500 |
| 3 | 66% Arcane Power | 1875 |
| 2 | 50% Arcane Power | 1250 |
| 1 | 33% Arcane Power | 625 |
| 0 | No Arcane Power | 0 |

The Arcane Value determines the extent of the class’s arcane spellcasting abilities, if any. Assign 0 to 4 build points to the class’s Arcane Value, noting down the appropriate powers and the XP cost.

**Arcane 1:** An Arcane Value of 1 gives the class the ability to casts spells and engage in magical research at only about one-third the power of a mage of the same class level. The class uses its effective caster level for purposes of level-dependent spell ranges, durations, and damage.

**Arcane 2:** An Arcane Value of 2 gives the class the ability to casts spells and engage in magical research at about one-half the power of a mage of the same class level. The class uses its effective caster level for purposes of level-dependent spell ranges, durations, and damage.

**Arcane 3:** An Arcane Value of 3 gives the class the ability to casts spells and engage in magical research at approximately two-thirds the power of a mage of the same class level. The class uses its effective caster level for purposes of level-dependent spell ranges, durations, and damage.

**Arcane 4:** An Arcane Value of 4 gives the class the ability to cast spells and engage in magical research as a mage.

### Arcane Spell Progressions

The following tables shows the spell progression and caster level by class level of an arcane class with Arcane 1, 2, 3, or 4.

### Delayed Arcane Spell Progressions

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Arcane 1 – Delayed Acquisition** | | | | | | | |
| **Level** | **1st** | **2nd** | **3rd** | **4th** | **5th** | **6th** | **Caster Level** |

| **13** | 3 | 3 | 2 | 2 | 1 | - | 9 |
| **14** | 3 | 3 | 2 | 2 | 2 | - | 10 |

At your discretion, a fractional level of arcane casting ability can be traded in for a superior arcane casting progression unlocked at a higher level. When the higher level is reached, the character will gain the ability to cast spells and his spellcasting ability will thereafter advance rapidly with each level of experience earned, as shown on the table below. By using a delayed arcane spell progression, it is possible to create a class with Arcane Value 2 that can eventually cast 6th level spells.

## Saving Throw Progression

Every custom class will use one of the four standard Saving Throw progressions of fighter, crusader, thief, or mage. The saving throw progression is critical, because it also determines the character’s magical item options, prime requisite, proficiencies, and hit points after 9th level.

To determine which saving throw progression your class uses, follow these steps:

1. Compare the values for Fighting, Thievery, Divine, and Arcane.
2. If the rating for one category is highest, use the Saving Throw progression for the core class which is associated with that category - fighter for Fighting, thief for Thievery, crusader for Divine, and mage for Arcane.
3. If two or more abilities are tied, use the progression for the first of the tied categories to appear in order on this list: Arcane, then Divine, then Fighting, then Thievery.

EXAMPLE: A custom class has the values Hit Die 0, Fighting 0, Thievery 0, Divine 2, Arcane 2. The class uses the saving throw progression for mages, because Arcane takes priority over Divine.

### Magical Items

Every custom class has access to magical items useable by all classes as well as the ability to use enchanted versions of weapons and armor available to it based on its Fighting Value. A custom class will also gain access to magic items useable by the core class associated with its saving throw progression, and for any class category with a value of at least 2 assigned.

EXAMPLE #1: A custom class has the values Hit Die 0, Fighting 0, Thievery 0, Divine 2, Arcane 2. The class uses the saving throw progression for mages, so it can use magical items restricted to mages. The class can also use magic items restricted to crusaders, because it has a Divine value of 2.

EXAMPLE #2: A custom class has the values Hit Die 0, Fighting 1, Thievery 2, Divine 0, Arcane 1. The class uses the saving throw progression for thieves, so it can use magical items restricted to thieves. Even though the class can cast arcane spells, it cannotuse magic items restricted to mages because it only has an Arcane value of 1.

### Key Attributes

Every custom class must have a key attribute. The prime requisite is determined by the class’s saving throw progression: Either STR or CON for fighter, INT for mage, WIL for crusader, and either DEX or CHA for thieves. The key attribute is chosen when the class is created.

In most cases, an additional key attribute is added for each class category (excluding HD value) in which a value of at least 2 is assigned. These requirements can be waived or expanded by the GM if he deems it necessary for balance or class favor.

### Proficiencies

Each custom class gets one general proficiency as a starting class power.

EXAMPLE: The standard fighter has Manual of Arms, a general proficiency, as a starting class power.

Each custom class also begins with one class proficiency and one general proficiency, selected by the template or roll or player’s choice, at 1st level. All classes share the same general proficiency list. Each custom class should be assigned a custom list of class proficiencies specifically chosen to reflect its powers and background. The custom class’s proficiency list could be drawn from whichever class it saves as, and/or from class categories with a value of at least 1 assigned. If desired, you can create new and unique proficiencies for the custom class’s proficiency list as well.

**Number of Proficiencies in Class List:** The number of proficiencies available to a custom class is always equal to (42 - maximum level). For most classes, this will be 28 proficiencies. Certain racial classes (described later) will have more proficiencies on their class list.

**Specialized Selection:** When a class list only has access to a specialized selection within either Art, Craft, Performance, or Profession, such as Performance (dance) or Profession (mortician), count that specialized selection as only 1/2 a proficiency for purposes of the class list.

### Hit Points after 9th Level

A custom class’s saving throw progression determines how many hit points it gains per level after 9th, according to the following mechanic:

* **Crusader or Mage:** 1 hit point per level after 9th
* **Fighter or Thief:** 2 hit points per level after 9th

## Strongholds and Followers

At particular milestones, all classes become eligible to build strongholds and attract followers. The exact nature of the stronghold and followers will depend on the choices made in allocating the custom class’s build points. The Custom Class Strongholds and Followers table below lists the available types of strongholds and the stronghold’s associated followers, along with the required build point allocation to qualify for them. The type of stronghold and followers must be selected when the custom class is created. A custom class can choose from any stronghold type and its associated followers it qualifies for. The name of the stronghold can be changed to match the name and theme of the custom class if desired.

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Custom Class Strongholds and Followers** | | | |
| **Stronghold Type** | **Minimum Value** | **Associated Followers** | **Requirements** |
| Cloister | 15,000gp | 1d6x30 0th level apprentices  1d20x10 1st level class members | Divine Value 3+ |
| Fortified Church | 15,000gp | 5d6x10 0th level fanatical mercs  1d6 1st-3rd level class members | Divine Value 2+ |
| Castle | 15,000gp | 5d6x10 0th level mercenaries  1d6 1st-3rd level class members | Fighting Value 1+ |
| Sanctum and Dungeon | 15,000gp | 2d6 0th level apprentices  1d6 1st- 3rd level class members | Arcame Value 2+ |
| Hideout | 5,000gp | 2d6 1st level class members | Thievery Value 1+ |
| Dwarven Vault | 15,000gp | 3d6x10 1st level dwarven mercs | Dwarf Value 0+ |
| Dwarven Vault (alternative) | 15,000gp | 1d4x10 1st level dwarven mercs  1d6 1st-3rd level class members | Dwarf Value 0+ |
| Elven Fastness | 15,000gp | 3d6x10 1st level elven mercs | Elf Value 0+, Fighting Value 2+ |

EXAMPLE #1: The standard explorer has the values Hit Die 1, Fighting 2, Thievery 1, Divine 0, Arcane 0. The explorer qualified for both a Castle and a Hideout type stronghold. The class was envisioned as a settler-conquistador type, so we selected Castle for its stronghold type, which we renamed Border Fort. One could imagine an alternative explorer class that graduates to building a Hideout at 9th level, akin to Robin Hood’s merry band of archers and outlaws.

EXAMPLE #2: The standard assassinhas the values Hit Die 1, Fighting 2, Thievery 1, Divine 0, Arcane 0. The assassin qualified for either a Castle or Hideout type stronghold. The assassin class was envisioned as functioning secretly within society, so we selected Hideout for its stronghold type. We could imagine an alternative assassin class that graduates to building a Castle at 9th level, perhaps resembling the historical Hashishin’s desert compounds.

### Stronghold-Based Bonus Powers

A custom class that selects Fortified Church as its stronghold type pays only half the cost for its stronghold. This can be due to, e.g., divine intervention, or it can simply represent subsidy from a church or guild. Additionally, the followers associated with Fortified Churches are completely loyal (+4 Morale) and need not be paid.

A custom class that selects Castle as its stronghold type receives a bonus custom power at 5th level that increases the morale of his retainers and henchmen under certain circumstances. The custom power may be **battlefield prowess**, **chronicles of battle**, or **experience and hardiness**, or a similar custom power approved by you.

A custom class that selects Dwarven Vault or Elven Fastness receives the bonus powers, and consequent limitations, described in the **Dwarven Vaults** and **Elven Fastnesses** section of *ACKS Imperial Imprint.*

## Experience Points per Level

To calculate the custom class’s XP, find the XP cost in each category that corresponds with your class’s value in that category, and add all the costs together. This is the experience required for your class to advance to 2nd level. The experience required to advance doubles each level thereafter until 8th level is reached.

After 8th level, the amount of experience required to advance no longer doubles. Instead, it increases by a flat amount each level. The amount required is based on the saving throw progression of the class.

* Crusader or Thief: Additional 100,000XP for each level after 8th.
* Fighter: An additional 120,000XP for each level after 8th.
* Mage: An additional 150,000XP for each level after 8th.

EXAMPLE: The standard bard requires 50,000XP to reach 7th level, and 100,000XP to reach 8th level. The bard saves on the thief progression, so to reach 9th level, the bard requires (100,000 + 100,000) 200,000XP. Then to reach 10th level, the bard requires (200,000 + 100,000) 300,000XP, and so on.

### Experience Point Smoothing

The level progressions in *ACKS Imperial Imprint* were modified to create a smoother, more elegant progression at higher levels. To emulate this for your custom class, round the experience point requirement for 7th level to the nearest 5,000.

EXAMPLE: The standard assassin requires 28,000XP to reach 6th level. Normally, that would mean that the assassin would require 56,000XP to reach 7th level. However, the experience point progression has been smoothed, so 56,000XP is rounded to 55,000XP.

## Custom Racial Classes

Custom racial classes are built using a similar system, with minor differences to reflect the race’s unique capabilities.

### Racial Class Category

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Build**  **Points** | **Level**  **Limit** |
| 8 | 8 |
| 7 | 10 |
| 6 | 11 |
| 5 | 12 |
| 4 | 13 |

The most important aspect of a racial class is that it has a **racial value** which gives special powers unique to that race. A racial custom class can allocate as many as 4 *extra* build points to its racial class category, for a total of *8 build points*. A racial class can still only spend a maximum of 4 build points on the Hit Dice, Fighting, Thievery, Divine, and Arcane categories, and it must expend at least 4 total build points across all its values. A racial custom class will have a maximum level between 8 and 13 determined by how many total build points the custom class uses, as noted on the accompanying table.

### Requirements

A race will impose one or more additional requirements on its custom classes. For example, all dwarven classes require Constitution 9 or better. All elven classes require Intellect 9 or better. If, for instance, an elven custom class also has Intellect as a key attribute then this requirement is moot, of course.

### Class Category Values

Certain races may receive slightly different benefits or penalties at different point values. Certain races may pay more or less XP for different point values.

### Racial Value

The class’s racial value will determine its racial custom powers. These may include both general abilities such as seeing in the dark, as well as class-like abilities such as casting spells. Assigning a Racial Value of 0 will generally provide the race’s general abilities, while a higher allocation will yield class-like abilities or additions or expansions on the race’s abilities.

### Saving Throws

Racial classes save as fighters, mages, thieves, or crusaders. However, each race will modify the saving throws based on its strengths and weaknesses, determined by its Racial Value.

Apart from any innate modifiers it might provide, the Racial Value is *not* used for purposes of determining a demi-human class’s saving throws, even when the Racial Value stacks with one of the Class Category Values.

EXAMPLE: The standard elven spellsword was built with Hit Dice Value 1, Fighting Value 2, Elf Value 4. The elven spellsword uses the saving throw progression for Fighters, even though the class spent the most build points in the Elf category.

Note that the elven spellswords and nightblade and dwarven craftpriest and vaultguard saving throw tables in the ***ACKS II***rulebook are simply the saving throw progressions for their respective underlying class progression, modified by their respective race’s adjustments.

### Magic Items

A racial value that stacks with one of the class category values will provide access to magic items useable by the class category if a combined value of at least 2 is assigned.

EXAMPLE: The standard elven spellsword was built with Hit Dice Value 1, Fighting Value 2, Elf Value 4. The class uses the saving throw progression for fighters, so it can use magical items restricted to fighters. The class can also use magic items restricted to mages, because Elf Value stacks with Arcane Value, and it has a combined value of at least 2 in Arcane + Elf.

### Strongholds

A racial value that stacks with one of the class category values will provide access to strongholds of the type appropriate to the class category if a combined value sufficient to meet the threshold is assigned. Some racial values also provide access to unique racial strongholds.

EXAMPLE: The standard elven spellsword was built with Hit Dice Value 1, Fighting Value 2, Arcane Value 1, Elf Value 3. The elven spellsword qualified for either a Castle, Sanctum, or Elven Fastness type stronghold. We chose Elven Fastness.

### Hit Points per Level after 9th

Some races will gain additional hit points per level after 9th in addition to those provided by their saving throw progression.

### Experience Point Progression After 8th level

Some races will increase the amount of experience required to gain each level after 8th.

## Dwarven Custom Classes

Dwarvesbelieve that they were forged by the hand of Istreus when the world was young, and were first taught the secrets of metal-work and machinery by the god himself. For centuries the stout, cunning people delved vast vaults in the Meniri and Jutting Mountains, gathering rich ores and creating enduring works of stone and iron. Eventually they came into contact with the expanding elven and human peoples of Aurëpos. These meetings were not peaceful, and the dwarven rhetors still recite tales of ancient battles that the elves and humans have long forgotten.

When the Aurans launched the great Empyrean War against Zahar, the dwarves took no part. The mighty automatons and war machines of the dwarves would have greatly aided in securing victory over the Zaharans, but the dwarves saw little cause in joining one faction of men in fighting another faction of men. History has shown the dwarves’ decision not to intervene to be a terrible error in judgment, however. When the Aurans defeated Zahar, they were too exhausted to fully cleanse the land of the beastmen. In the absence of constant warfare to reduce their numbers, the beastman population exploded. The beastmen were largely kept out of the north by elven and human garrisons, and soon migrated into the mountains in great numbers. The dwarves soon found themselves in a never-ending war for their own tunnels and vaults. Today, the dwarves are a dying race barely clinging to the last of their vaults in the great Meniri and Jutting Mountains. They constantly seek new artifacts and war machines to make up for ever dwindling numbers.

Dwarven character classes are created using the dwarven racial category and experience points. Requirements, class category values, hit points per level after 9th, and experience point progressions are modified as noted below.

### Requirements

All dwarven classes require a minimum Constitution 9 or better.

### Class Category Values

**Fighting:** Due to their short stature, dwarves may never use two-handed swords or longbows, regardless of their Fighting Value. Dwarves with narrow or broad weapon selections must include at least four axes, flails, hammers, and/or maces among their selections.

**Divine:** Dwarves who reach the 9th level of Divine spellcasting are eligible to create Constructs, as if they were 11th level crusaders.

**Arcane:** Dwarves can never allocate build points to the Arcane category.

**Designer’s Note:** The ***By This Axe***sourcebook introduces a new class category value called Gnostic, which is used by the earthforger and furnacewife classes in that cyclopedia.

### Dwarf Value

When building a dwarven custom class, assign between 0 and 4 build points to the class’s Dwarf Value. At Dwarf 0, all dwarves gain the following four dwarven custom powers:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Value** | **Dwarf** | **XP Cost** |
| 4 | Dwarf +4 proficiencies | 1250 |
| 3 | Dwarf +3 proficiencies | 900 |
| 2 | Dwarf +2 proficiencies | 600 |
| 1 | Dwarf +1 proficiencies | 400 |
| 0 | Dwarf | 200 |

* **Sensitivity to Rock and Stone:** All dwarves gain a +1 bonus to surprise rolls when underground. When using Adventuring proficiency to search or listen, they succeed on a proficiency throw of 14+ (instead of the usual 18+). If separately proficient in Searching they gain a +4 bonus to their throw instead. If separately proficient in Listening, they gain a +2 bonus to their throw instead.
* **Dwarf Tongues:** All dwarves speak four bonus languages: Dwarf, Gnome, Goblin, and Kobold.
* **Hardy:** All dwarves gain a +3 bonus on Blast saving throws and a +4 bonus on all other saving throws.

Additional points allocated to the Dwarf Value represents the dwarven expertise in crafts and lore. Each point provides one bonus general proficiency as well as a +1 bonus on proficiency throws and thief skills. The bonus does *not* apply to the racial ability to Search and Listen, as that proficiency throw’s target value already reflects the full measure of dwarven expertise. It also does not apply to proficiency throws to rebuke undead, which is a miracle of faith and unaffected by attention to detail.

EXAMPLE: The dwarven craftpriest has Dwarf Value 3. The dwarven craftpriest began with 3 bonus general proficiencies and gains +3 to all proficiency throws.

### Hit Points per Level after 9th

Dwarves receive an extra 1 hp per level after 9th, in addition to hit points gained based on their saving throw progression.

### Experience Point Progression After 8th level

Dwarves using the fighter progression increase the amount of experience required to gain each level after 8th by 10,000XP. Dwarves using the crusader or thief progression increase the amount of experience required to gain each level after 8th by 30,000XP.

## Elven Custom Classes

The elves claim to be the first born children of the Empyrean gods. As evidence of their elder status, they point to early elven settlements in the Pillars of Dawn and the forests of Argollë, closest to the rising sun of Ammonar. It is unquestioned that elven civilization was at an advanced state well before human civilization had progressed past tribal bands. From 3,500 B.E. to 1,650 B.E., the elves expanded to every shore of the Ammas Aurë, establishing the longest-lasting empire yet to dominate Aurëpos. The Argollëan Empire was eventually destroyed in a terrible cataclysm known to historians as the Fall.

Few facts are confirmed about the Fall, and all elven records from that time period have been lost or destroyed. The Temple of the Winged Sun teaches that The Fall came about from hubris: The elves aspired to be like the Empyreans, and emulated them in creating life. It is taught that from these works came the terrible *things* that later corrupted Zahar. The elves, of course, deny this. Whatever the truth of the Fall, afterwards the elves were a scattered and ruined people, and the now-extinct Thrassian race claimed their lands.

Today only a single elven kingdom survives, in Northern Argollë, though scattered fastnesses can still be found in forests throughout Aurëpos. Elves that hail from Northern Argollë style themselves *high elves*, and count themselves as the inheritors of their race’s ancient glories. Elves from the outlying fastnesses call themselves *wood elves*. While less cultured than high elves, wood elves yet retain something of the martial vigor of the elves of old.

Elven character classes are created using the elven racial category and experience points. Requirements, class category values, hit points per level after 9th, and experience point progressions are modified as noted below. There are no mechanical differences between “high” and “wood” elves, but different classes may be appropriate.

### Requirements

All elven classes require a minimum Intellect 9 or better.

### Class Category Values

**Fighting:** Elves with narrow or broad weapon selections *must* include at least two bows, crossbows, swords, or daggers among their selections.

**Arcane:** Any build points allocated to the Arcane Value stack with build points allocated to the Elf value for purposes of determining the class’s spellcasting ability (see below). Because of their innate magical power, the XP Cost for the Arcane Value is reduced by 125XP for elven classes.

EXAMPLE: The standard elven spellsword is built with Hit Dice 1, Fighting Value 2, Arcane Value 1, Elf Value 3. The XP cost for level 2 is 500 + 1,000 + (625-125) + 2000, for a total of 4,000XP.

### Elf Value

When building an elven custom class, assign between 0 and 4 build points to the class’s Elf Value. At Elf 0, all elves gain the following four elven custom powers:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Value** | **Elf** | **XP Cost** |
| 4 | Elf + 100% Arcane | 2500 |
| 3 | Elf + 66% Arcane | 2000 |
| 2 | Elf + 50% Arcane | 1375 |
| 1 | Elf + 33% Arcane | 750 |
| 0 | Elf | 125 |

* **Animal Friendship:** Whenever elves build fastnesses, all ordinary animals within 5 miles of the stronghold become kind and helpful to the elves.
* **Attunement to Nature:** Elves gain a +1 bonus to surprise rolls when in the wilderness. When using the Adventuring proficiency to search or listen, they succeed on a proficiency throw of 14+ (instead of the usual 18+). If separately proficient in Searching they gain a +2 bonus to their throw instead. If separately proficient in Listening, they gain a +4 bonus to their throw instead.
* **Connection to Nature:** All elves are immune to diseases caused by undead, and gain a +1 bonus on saving throws versus Petrification/Paralysis and Spells. Their robust vitality grants a +1 bonus to their HD roll at 1st level.
* **Elf Tongues:** All elves speak four bonus languages: Elf, Gnoll, Hobgoblin, and Orc.

Additional points allocated to the Elf Value stack with points allocated to the Arcane Value for purposes of spellcasting, magical research, strongholds, and magic item usability. Add the two values to find the class’s effective spellcasting abilities. For values of 5 or greater, use the following mechanics:

**Arcane + Elf 5:** The class has the ability to cast spells and engage in magical research as a mage, with the class’s spells per level increased by 33%. The class uses its class level for all level-dependent spell ranges, durations, and damages; these are not increased.

**Arcane + Elf 6:** As above, but the class’s spells per level are increased by 50%.

**Arcane + Elf 7:** As above, but the class’s spells per level are increased by 66%.

**Arcane + Elf 8:** As above, but the class’s spells per level are increased by 100%.

When calculating number of spells available, round fractions of 1/2 or more up; round any smaller fractions down.

EXAMPLE: An elven custom class has Arcane 3 and Elf 3. Adding the values together yields 6. The custom class has the spellcasting abilities of a mage with a spell progression with 50% more spells. A 3rd level mage has 2 1st and 1 2nd level spells; when this custom class is 3rd level, it will have (2 x 1.5 = 3) 3 1st level spells and (1 x 1.5 =1.5, rounded up to 2) 2 2nd level spell.

All elven spellcasters can cast spells wearing whatever armor they are permitted to use.

### Experience Point Progression After 8th level

Elves increase the amount of experience required to gain each level after 8th by 50,000XP.

## Halfling Custom Classes

Halflings are a race of diminutive and insular humanoids noted for their love of food, wealth, and comfort and their dislike of big people, strangers, and travel. Descending from human and dwarven stock, they stand about 3’ tall, with ruddy skin, dark hair, and brown or black eyes. Among the most hirsute of the humanoid races, halflings cultivate their body hair the way dwarves cultivate their beards. Well-groomed foot hair is the mark of a halfling of fine breeding. Halflings live in small, close-knit communities of hill burrows with big, round windows. These “halfling holes” are a compromise between a dwarven heritage that craves the security of thick earth overhead and a human bloodline clamoring for sun and space.

### Requirements

All halfling classes require a minimum Dexterity 9 or better.

### Class Category Values

**Fighting:** Halflings with narrow weapon selections are limited to choosing from the following weapons: bola, dagger, darts, hand axe, javelin, sling, short bow, short sword. Halflings with broad weapon selections can also choose battle axe, crossbow, mace, or sword. (Also see the Undersized racial weakness, below.) Halflings cannot allocate more than 2 points to Fighting.

**Arcane:** Halflings may not allocate points to the Arcane value.

### Halfling Value

When building a halfling custom class, assign between 0 and 4 build points to the class’s Halfling Value. These points represent the degree by which the members of the class embody archetypical halfling characteristics.

**Halfling 0:** At Halfling 0, all halflings gain the following halfling custom powers:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Value** | **Halfling** | **XP Cost** |
| 4 | Halfling 4 | -150 |
| 3 | Halfling 3 | -225 |
| 2 | Halfling 2 | -300 |
| 1 | Halfling 1 | -375 |
| 0 | Halfling 0 | -450 |

* **Child-like:** Any halfling character suffers -2 to loyalty and morale from any non-halfling henchman, but gains +2 to loyalty and morale from any halfling henchman. This does not affect their reaction rolls.
* **Demi-human Ancestry:** Due to their dwarven ancestry, halflings gain a +1 bonus on Paralysis and Spells saving throws.
* **Difficult to Corrupt:**  Halfling crave comfort and security far to much to be able to descend into dastardly wickedness. They suffer only 1/2 the usual amount of Corruption from spending time in sinkholes of evil (p. XX), using evil magic items (p. XX), or other causes of corruption. (If the campaign does not include corruption, this power has no effect.)
* **Easily Encumbered:** Halflings have a normal load of 3 st instead of 5 st. They have a speed of 60’ when carrying 3 1/6 to 4 3/6 st. They have a speed of 45’ when carrying 4 4/6 st to 6 st. They have a speed of 30’ when carrying more than 6 st. A halfling can carry a maximum of 12 stone, modified by his Strength bonus or penalty.
* **Halfling Tongues:** All halflings speak the common tongue, their native tongue, and three bonus languages, selected from the following list based on their shire’s proximity to other races and realms: Bugbear, Dwarf, Elf, Gnome, Goblin, Human (various), Hobgoblin, Kobold, Orc.
* **Heroic Breakfast:** Once per day a halfling can recover hp by consuming a meal accompanied by alcohol, coffee, or tea. This recovery is equal to the hit points gained from a day of rest, and can be in addition to rest.
* **Underfoot:** Because of their small size, halflings can more easily avoid attacks by big, clumsy creatures. Monsters of larger than man-sized suffer a -2 penalty to their attack throws against halflings.
* **Short-Statured:** Due to their short stature, halflings have a speed of 90’ when unencumbered. They can never wield large-sized weapons such as arbalests, great axes, morning stars, lances, longbows, polearms, staffs, or two-handed swords, and must use two hands when wielding medium-sized weapons such as battle axes, maces, and swords.
* **Weak:** Halflings have a -4 penalty to proficiency throws to Dungeonbashing proficiency throws. In addition, they roll one die size smaller than normal for their Hit Dice (d8 becomes d6; d6 becomes d4; d4 becomes d2).

Additional points allocated to the Halfling Value represents the halfling’s expertise in certain specialized skills and abilities that are shared by word of mouth between halfling adventurers, free spirits, and travelers. Each point provides one **halfling skill** selected from the following: Hiding, Listening, Lockpicking, Searching, Sneaking, or Trapbreaking (as thief); Natural Stealth or Evasion (as explorer); or Arcane Dabbling, Beast Friendship, Magical Music, Passing Without Trace, Precise Shooting, Running, Skirmishing, Swashbuckling (as class proficiency); or Placating, a special halfling-only class power.

**Placating:** A halfling may use disarming words, glib talk, or submissive body language to avoid being attacked. A halfling may not attack while placating, but may walk at half speed, or perform an action in lieu of moving, such as standing up from being knocked down, picking an item off the ground, or retrieving an item from a pack or sack. A halfling may not placate if he, or any other halflings in his party, have already attacked an opponent during the present encounter. When a halfling is placating, any opponent attempting to strike or otherwise directly attack the halfling must attempt a saving throw versus Spells. If the save succeeds, the opponent can attack the halfling normally that round. If the save fails, the opponent will not attack the halfling that round and will attack another creature instead. Area effects may still affect the halfling. Mindless creatures and fantastic creatures of animal intelligence cannot be placated, but ordinary animals and all sapient creatures are susceptible to a halfling's cringing placation.

EXAMPLE: The Halfling Burglar is built with class category values of HD 1, Fighting 1b, Thief 2, Halfling 3. The HD 1 value would normally yield 1d6 hp per level, but the Weak class power reduces this to 1d4 hp per level. The Fighting 1b Broad weapon selection is traded down to Narrow weapon selection in exchange for 2 class powers. Therefore the Halfling Burglar receives 2 class powers, 5 thief skills, and 3 halfling skills, for a total of 10 special abilities. As a 7-point racial class build, Halfling Burglars are limited to the 10th level of experience. They require (500 + 500 + 400 - 225) 1,175 XP to advance to level 2.

EXAMPLE: The Halfling Bounder is built with class category values of HD 2, Fighting 2, Halfling 4. The HD 2 value would normally yield 1d8 hp per level, but the Weak class power reduces this to 1d6 hp per level. The Fighting 2 Unrestricted weapon selection is traded down to Broad weapon selection in exchange for 1 class power. Therefore the Halfling Bounder receives 1 class power and 4 halfling skills, for a total of 5 special abilities. As an 8-point racial build, Halfling Bounders are limited to the 8th level of experience. They require (1000 + 1000 + 150 - 150) 2,000 XP to advance to level 2.

## Nobiran Custom Classes

Nobiran is a classical Auran term meaning “descended from the gods”; and a Nobirus is one such descendant (the plural is Nobir). The original Nobir were the heroes of the Empyrean War, kings and prophets granted epic power by the gods. Though these bloodlines have faded with the passing of time, occasionally a child is still born with some measure of the old gifts, superior to normal humans in nobility of spirit and strength of body. Nobiran appearance can vary depending on ethnicity, but they are always tall, well-built, and proud featured.

Outside of the Auran Empire campaign setting, Nobir could be used to model any demi-human race of exceptional power and nobility, such as the half-human, half-divine demigods of Greek myth, the Aasimar of the Forgotten Realms, or the Dúnedainof Tolkien’s Middle Earth.

Nobiran character classes are created using the Nobirus racial category and experience points. Requirements, class category values, hit points per level after 9th, and experience point progressions are modified as noted below.

### Requirements

All Nobiran classes require a minimum 11 or better in *all* ability scores. Those who truly embody the epic heroes of old must be above average in every respect.

### Class Category Values

**Divine:** Nobirans can never allocate build points to the Divine category. However, the Nobirus value functions as a substitute for it.

### Nobirus Value

When building a Nobirus custom class, assign between 0 and 4 build points to the class’s Nobirus Value. At Nobirus 0, all Nobirus gain the following Nobirus custom powers:

* **Blood of Kings:** The blood of ancient kings and heroes flows in every Nobirus. The character may hire one more henchman than his Charisma would otherwise permit, and the base morale score of any henchmen is increased by 1.
* **Favor of the Empyrean Powers:** As the favored of the Empyrean powers, all Nobirus characters receive a +2 bonus to all saving throws.
* **Heroic Spirit:** Because of their courageous spirit, the maximum class level for any Nobirus class is increased by 1.
* **Longeval:** All Nobiran characters are ageless and enjoys a lifespan three times longer than normal. They are immune to diseases caused by undead and gains a +1 bonus to their HD rolls at 1st level.

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Value** | **Nobirus** | **XP Cost** |
| 4 | Nobirus + Crusader (Spells x 150%) | 2125 |
| 3 | Nobirus + Crusader (Spells x 133%) | 1125 |
| 2 | Nobirus + Crusader | 625 |
| 1 | Nobirus + Reduced Crusader | 375 |
| 0 | Nobirus | 125 |

Additional points allocated to the Nobirus Value offer divine spellcasting abilities, including the ability to rebuke undead, identical to those of the Divine Value with the same score. Remember that Nobirans cannot take the Divine Value; if they want divine spells, they gain them through the Nobiran value.

EXAMPLE #1: A Nobiran custom class has Hit Dice 2, Fighting 2, and Nobirus 2. The class has HD and fighting ability of a fighter combined with the spellcasting and rebuking of a crusader. He requires 2,625 XP to advance to 2nd level.

Remember that, like other demi-humans, a Nobirus may still only spend a maximum of 4 build points on the Hit Dice, Fighting, Thievery, and Arcane categories in total.

EXAMPLE: A Nobiran custom class has Hit Dice 2, Arcane 3, and Nobirus 1. Adding the build points spent on Hit Dice and Arcane (2+3) yields 5. This is above the maximum permitted of 4, so the class must be modified.

### Experience Point Progression After 8th level

Nobir increase the amount of experience required to gain each level after 8th by 40,000XP.

## Zaharan Custom Classes

The Zaharan race originated in the fertile southlands that today are called the Waste. The Zaharans learned black arts of sorcery in countless centuries of foul service to the reptilian Thrassians. But as evil breeds evil, in time the Zaharans turned their sorcery against their inhuman masters. The Zaharan sorcerer Uragasi, calling himself the savior of men, led an uprising against the Thrassians and toppled the reptilian empire. Victorious over the reptile race, the Zaharans claimed the ancient capital of the Thrassians as their own, beginning an imperial era of all-too-human cruelty and rapaciousness. At their height, the Zaharans became the uncontested rulers of everything from the Pillars of Dawn to the Endless Steppe. Like the Thrassians before them, the Zaharans worshipped the Chthonic powers, and they created sub-human creatures to serve as slaves and soldiers. After four centuries of tyrannical dominance, the kingdom of Zahar fell to the wrath of Empyrean crusaders. In the aftermath, the Zaharan people were scattered and their civilization left in ruins. Only in Kemesh, Zahar’s most far-flung province, did Zaharan society survive the fall of their empire intact.

Though they once dominated the entire Ammas Aurë region, pure-blooded Zaharans are today exceptionally rare outside of the noble families of Kemesh. When they do appear, pure-blooded Zaharans are of moderate height, with gaunt stature. They have very long heads and faces featuring long, high noses, giving them an arrogant, slightly inhuman appearance. Their skin color is a warm brown, while their hair is thick, straight, and dark, and their eyes are black and deep set.

Outside of the Auran Empire campaign setting, Zaharans could be used to model any dark, eldritch race, such as the Melnibonéans of Moorcock’s Multiverse or the Drow of Gygax’s Greyhawk.

Zaharan character classes are created using the Zaharan racial category and experience points. Requirements, class category values, hit points per level after 9th, and experience point progressions are modified as noted below.

### Requirements

All Zaharan classes require a minimum Intellect, Will, and Charisma of 9 or better.

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Value** | **Zaharan** | **XP Cost** |
| 4 | Zaharan + 100% Arcane | 2700 |
| 3 | Zaharan + 66% Arcane | 2075 |
| 2 | Zaharan + 50% Arcane | 1450 |
| 1 | Zaharan + 33% Arcane | 825 |
| 0 | Zaharan | 200 |

### Class Category Values

**Arcane:** Any build points allocated to the Arcane Value stack with build points allocated to the Zaharan value for purposes of determining the class’s spellcasting ability (see below).

### Zaharan Value

When building a Zaharan custom class, assign between 0 and 4 build points to the class’s Zaharan Value. At Zaharan 0, all Zaharans gain the following four Zaharan custom powers:

* **After the Flesh:** Through undeath, the black sorcerers of Zahar can grow stronger. If transformed into intelligent undead, they retain their racial powers and any class abilities. Their class abilities must still be paid for as special abilities (see below).

The number of special abilities the class abilities are worth is determined by tallying up its build points. Add 1/2 its build points in the Arcane, Divine, or other magic type values; 1/3 its build points in the Thievery value; and 1/3 its build points in any racial values that don’t improve spellcasting. Don’t add any for its HD or Fighting value. For example, a Zaharan ruinguard (built with HD 2, Fighting 2, and Zaharan 2) has 0 + 0 + 2/2 = 1 special ability (\*).

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Class**  **Category** | **# of Special**  **Abilities (\*)** |
| Arcane/Divine | Category Value /2 |
| Thievery/Racial | Category Value /3 |
| Fighting/HD | 0 |

Once transformed, a Zaharan may continue to advance in Hit Dice without limit, regardless of his class’s maximum level. At 1 HD, it requires 3,000XP plus 500XP per special ability (\*) to advance to 2 HD. The amount of XP required doubles with each HD (round values greater than 20,000XP to the nearest 1,000).

As the undead Zaharan’s Hit Dice increase, any class abilities (such as thief skills, spellcasting, turning undead, etc.) will continue to progress without regard to his class’s maximum level, to a maximum of 14th level.

* **Ancient Pacts:** In elder days, the lords of Zahar ensorcelled the dark powers of the world in pacts of service and obedience. Some creatures still remember these pacts and will aid Zaharans when commanded. All Zaharans gain a +1 bonus to reaction rolls when encountering intelligent chaotic monsters. Intelligent chaotic monsters suffer a -2 penalty to saving throws against any **charm** spells cast by a Zaharan.
* **Dark Soul:** The grim embrace of death holds special perils for Zaharan characters. Whenever a deceased Zaharan rolls on the Tampering With Mortality table, they suffer a penalty on the 1d20 roll of -1 per level of experience.
* **Inexorable:** Zaharans are unflinching in the face of horrors that terrify normal men. The character is immune to all natural and magical fear effects.
* **Zaharan Tongues:** All Zaharans speak four bonus languages: Ancient Zaharan, Goblin, Orc, and Kemeshi.

EXAMPLE: Let’s imagine that Zaharan Sorcerer-Priest is designed as a custom class with all the spellcasting abilities of both a crusader and mage (Hit Dice 0, Fighting 0, Thievery 0, Divine 2, Arcane 2, Zaharan 2). This class costs 6 build points, meaning its maximum level is 11. After many sessions of play, a Zaharan Sorcerer-Priest character has advanced to 11th level. The character then transforms into a mummy by necromantic ritual. The class’s build points, excluding Hit Dice, are (2+2+2) 6, so retaining the class abilities count as three special abilities. The character is therefore an 11\*\*\*\* HD mummy (11 HD because he was 11th level; \* from mummy; \*\*\* from class abilities). The Zaharan Mummy Sorcerer-Priest then begins advancing in HD. His HD may advance without limit. His class abilities will continue to increase as he gains HD, until he achieves the maximum of 14th level of divine and arcane spellcasting ability.

Additional points allocated to the Zaharan Value stack with points allocated to the Arcane Value for purposes of spellcasting, magical research, strongholds, and magic item usability. Add the two values to find the class’s effective spellcasting abilities. For values of 5 or greater, use the following mechanics:

**Arcane + Zaharan 5:** The class has the ability to cast spells and engage in magical research as a mage, with the class’s spells per level increased by 33%. The class uses its class level for all level-dependent spell ranges, durations, and damages; these are not increased.

**Arcane + Zaharan 6:** As above, but the class’s spells per level are increased by 50%.

**Arcane + Zaharan 7:** As above, but the class’s spells per level are increased by 66%.

**Arcane + Zaharan 8:** As above, but the class’s spells per level are increased by 100%.

When calculating number of spells available, round fractions of 1/2 or more up; round any smaller fractions down. All Zaharan spellcasters can cast spells wearing whatever armor they are permitted to use.

### Experience Point Progression After 8th level

Zaharans increase the amount of experience required to gain each level after 8th by 50,000XP. This penalty does not apply if they become undead, however.

## Custom Powers

Custom powers are the special abilities that make classes unique. Custom powers may simply be class proficiencies or general proficiencies that are automatically assigned to every member of the class (such as the bard’s Performance proficiency) or they may be special abilities unique to the class.

By definition, custom powers are powers that are outside of the class powers of crusaders, fighters, mages, and thieves. For purposes of these rules, custom powers do *not* include (i) arcane or divine spellcasting, (ii) rebuking undead, (iii) fighter cleaving or weapon damage, or (iv) thief skills.

For instance, a character cannot trade in fighting skill or rebuking undead powers to get thief skills – thief skills can *only* be acquired by putting points into the Thievery Value. This is why the Ambushing, Climbing, and Eavesdropping proficiencies exist, as these powers might be selected by classes not otherwise interested in thievery.

### Custom Power Trade-Offs

In lieu of beginning with one or more custom powers, a custom class may instead select multiple powers that are “locked” until an advanced level of experience is earned. For example, a class might trade one custom power at 1st level in exchange for two custom powers, one unlocking at 4th level and 10th level.

The Custom Power Trade-Offs table below shows some possible options. You may devise other options along these lines as desired.

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Custom Power Trade-Offs** | | | |
| **Trade-Off** | **Benefit** | **Trade-Off** | **Benefit** |
| 1 initial power | 1 power at 2nd and 1 power at 12th level | 1 power at 8th level | 1 power at 10th and 1 power at 13th level |
| 1 initial power | 1 power at 3rd and 1 power at 11th level | 1 power at 8th level | 1 power at 9th and 1 power at 14th level |
| 1 initial power | 1 power at 4th and 1 power at 10th level | 1 power at 9th level | 1 power at 10th and 1 power at 14th level |
| 1 initial power | 1 power at 5th and 1 power at 9th level | 1 power at 9th level | 1 power at 11th and 1 power at 13th level |
| 1 initial power | 1 power at 6th and 1 power at 8th level | 1 power at 9th level | 2 powers at 12th level |
| 1 initial power | 2 powers at 7th level | 1 power at 10th level | 1 power at 11th and 1 power at 14th level |
| 2 initial powers | 1 power at 3rd, 5th, and 7th level | 1 power at 10th level | 1 power at 12th and 1 power at 13th level |
| 2 initial powers | 1 power at 2nd, 4th, and 9th level | 1 power at 11th level | 2 powers at 13th level |
| 2 initial powers | 3 powers at 5th level | 1 power at 11th level | 1 power at 12th and 1 power at 14th level |
| 1 power at 7th level | 1 power at 9th and 1 power at 13th level | 1 power at 12th level | 1 power at 13th and 1 power at 14th level |
| 1 power at 7th level | 1 power at 8th and 1 power at 14th level |  |  |

A custom class with thief skills *is* permitted to trade initial thief skill selections for multiple “locked” selections at a higher level. In this way, a class can be built that unlocks thief skills over time, or that mixes thief skills and custom powers.

EXAMPLE: A custom class has a Thievery Value of 2, giving it 8 skills. It trades two skill selections for skills at 2nd, 4th, and 9th level. It trades its third skill selection for skills at 3rd and 11th level. It trades its fourth skill selection for skills at 5th and 9th level. It trades its fifth skill selection for skills at 6th and 8th level. Finally, the class then trades one of the skills it will receive at 9th level for a skill at 10th level and 14th level. The class will get 3 thief skills at 1st level and an additional skill at 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th, and 14th level. It is possible to make very complex trade-offs, obviously!

When a thief skill or custom power is locked until a higher level of experience, the skill or power will unlock with its proficiency throw at class level.

### Custom Power Creation

You might wish to create new custom powers. Custom powers generally either (1) provide a bonus to one or more rolls or throws; (2) provide a specialized skill; or (3) enable the character to use a spell-like ability.

###### Bonuses to Rolls and Throws

Many custom powers provide bonuses to attack throws, initiative rolls, and so on. The guidelines below can be helpful in creating similar new powers.

**Armor Class:** A flat AC bonus of +1 in all circumstances counts as 1 custom power. If the power provides a bonus regardless of the armor the character is wearing, the bonus should never exceed +1. If the bonus is limited to leather armor or less, the bonus should begin at +1 but can increase to +2 at 7th level and +3 at 13th level. If the bonus requires a particular piece of equipment (such as a shield), it can provide a secondary benefit related to the equipment. For example, Fighting Style (weapon and shield) requires a shield, but has the secondary benefit of allowing the character to ready and sling his shield without using a combat action to do so.

**Attack Throws:** A flat +1 bonus to attack throws with either missile or melee weapons counts as 1 custom power. Attack throw bonuses can also be limited to a +1 bonus with either a specific group of weapons (e.g. Fighting Style) or against a specific category of opponents (e.g. Goblin-Slaying). If limited to a specific category of opponents, the bonus can increase with level (+2 at 7th level, +3 at 13th level). If limited to a specific group of weapons, the power can include a secondary benefit, such as free sheathing of the weapon. If the power carries substantial drawbacks, such as the inability to retreat from combat, a +2 bonus with a secondary benefit might be allowed (e.g. Berserkergang).

**Damage:** A flat damage bonus of +1 with all weapons counts as 1 custom power. It should have no secondary benefits. A power that offers a damage bonus of +1 with a specific group of weapons (e.g. Fighting Style) should offer a secondary benefit, such as free sheathing of the weapons. Characters can only gain damage bonuses that scale with level by selecting a Fighting Value 2 or higher; the Fighter Damage bonus (or something analogous to it) cannot be gained with trade-offs.

**Initiative:** A universal bonus of +1 to initiative counts as 1 custom power. If the power provides a bonus to initiative only in specific circumstances, it can have a secondary benefit. For instance, Battle Magic only provides an initiative bonus when casting spells, so it offers secondary benefits against spell resistance. An explorer’s Animal Reflexes does not provide an initiative bonus for spellcasting, so it offers a secondary benefit on surprise rolls. A bladedancer’s Initiative bonus applies in all circumstances, so it has no secondary benefits.

**Saving Throws:** A universal +2 bonus to all saving throws counts as 1 custom power. If a custom power offers only a +1 bonus to some or all saving throws, it should have some secondary benefits, such as elves’ Connection to Nature. A custom power that offers +3 or better to saving throws should only be used in rare circumstances, and should count as at least 2 custom powers. The Hardy People power possessed by dwarves, for instance, counts as 3 custom powers.

**Surprise:** A universal +2 bonus to surprise rolls counts as 1 custom power. A universal +1 bonus to surprise rolls is usually a secondary benefit to another class power, such as an explorer’s Animal Reflexes. A +1 bonus to surprise throws that is limited in circumstances and has no other special benefits, counts as 1/2 a custom power. Imposing a penalty of -2 to opponent’s surprise rolls counts as 1 custom power.

###### Specialized Skills

Some custom powers give characters specialized skills, such as Loremastery or Magical Engineering.

Powers that allow the character to attempt a specialized, but not particularly adventurous, task should have a fixed target value that does not change with character level. Making maps, crafting items, and similar tasks fall are examples. *ACKS* uses a default proficiency throw of 11+ for these tasks, with a +4 bonus for each additional proficiency or power allocated to the power. When a proficiency throw is set at 11+, a character has a 50% chance of succeeding at using it. This makes it very easy for the player and Judge to understand the implications of any bonuses or penalties on the roll. Moreover, these default values reward breadth across characters and depth of specialization within one character at approximately the same rate. That is, if two characters in the party take the same ability, the chance at least one succeeds will be 75%. If one character takes the same ability twice, the chance he succeeds will be 70%. Parties can have well-rounded or highly specialized characters, and both types of parties can succeed 70% of the time.

Powers that exclusively relate to adventuring, fighting, and casting spells should follow a per-level progression of target values, with initial target values ranging from 14+ to 20+, depending on the utility and risk of the power. The target value should then decrease with each level of experience earned, usually by 1 point per level. Class level is used even if the power is gained later in progression.

###### Spellcasting Abilities and Spell-Like Abilities

Several custom powers grant the class the ability to cast a spell at certain intervals or to use spells as spell-like abilities (e.g. cast them as combat actions). Should you wish to create other examples of similar custom powers, the following guidelines should be used:

**Level 1:** The power can be used at will with a casting time of 1 turn; once per hour with a casting time of 1 round; once per 8 hours as a spell-like ability; or at will but require stationary concentration for the duration.

**Level 2:** The spell can be used once per hour with a casting time of 1 turn; once per 8 hours with a casting time of 1 round; or once per day as a spell-like ability.

**Level 3:** The spell can be used once per 8 hours with a casting time of 1 turn; once per day with a casting time of 1 round; or once per week as a spell-like ability.

**Level 4:** The spell can be used once per day with a casting time of 1 turn; once per week with a casting time of 1 round; or once per month as a spell-like ability.

**Level 5:** The spell can be used once per week with a casting time of 1 turn or once per month with a casting time of 1 round.

**Level 6:** The spell can be used once per month with a casting time of 1 turn.

The caster level of spell-like abilities will always be either the minimum caster level or the class level, whichever is greater.

**Balancing Spell-Like Abilities**

When permitting spell-like abilities as class powers, you should always use careful discretion, as certain combinations of powers, or certain otherwise innocuous spells turned into class powers, can have unexpected results out of proportion to their normal game effect. For this reason, you must review spellcasting and spell-like abilities with the strictest scrutiny.

Blast, death, and enchantment effects should generally not be permitted as spellcasting or spell-like abilities at all. Spellcasting abilities and spell-like abilities other than detection should generally not appear as a class power at a level of experience lower than the spell’s level. For example, a class with the ability to *restore life and limb*once per month at 1st level should never be permitted. Classes with an XP progression faster than a crusader should never be assigned spell-like abilities with effects that scale with level.

### Custom Power Index

To assist GMs and players who wish to further exploit the custom class creation system, this section compiles a list of the exact custom powers used in building all of the classes in ***ACKS****,* ***ACKS II****,* ***By This Axe****,* ***Player’s Companion****,* ***Heroic Fantasy Handbook****,* ***Barbarian Conquerors of Kanahu****,* ***Secrets of the Nethercity****,* and ***AXIOMS****.* The classes which have the powers are noted in brackets. We’ve included powers from classes that aren’t in ***ACKS II*** so that you easily convert any of those classes to ***ACKS II***mechanics – the work has been done for you. Some of the custom powers rely on game mechanics found in their sourcebook, and players and Judges should refer to those books for further details.

When used in the powers below, “the character” refers to any member of the class. This document is intended to be comprehensive but in order to remain manageable in size, it does exclude some custom powers:

* We haven’t listed the thief skills, as they cannot be selected via trade-offs as custom powers.
* We have generally excluded custom powers that grant spell-like abilities following the standard schedule of usage described under Spell-Like Abilities (p. XX). Occasionally where the same spell-like ability shows up repeatedly in several classes, we have listed it for easy reference, as with the warlock’s various spell-like abilities that are shared with the occultist.
* We have generally not listed below those custom powers which simply assign the character a bonus proficiency. However, we have listed those custom powers which are identical to a proficiency mechanically but in the game world are separate abilities that can be stacked with the proficiency in particular ways or have important variations. For instance, the Secrets of the Dark Arts custom power is mechanically identical to the Black Lore of Zahar proficiency, but since Secrets of the Dark Arts can be stacked on top of Black Lore, it has been included in the list. We have also listed those custom powers where the proficiency itself has changed in ***ACKS II****.*
* Monstrous special abilities that are possessed by monstrous character classes. Monstrous special abilities are only available to GM-made racial custom classes or leveled monsters. The XP cost for such characters should be determined based on the rules in ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual****.*

Some custom powers below are so limited in scope that they only count as 1/2 a power. Others are so useful as to count as 1 1/2 , 2, or even more custom powers if selected. This is noted in italics.

**Abominable Mutation:** The character’s self-experimentation has turned him into something both more and less than human. The character gains an abominable mutation, choosing from either *beast eyes, claw-like nails, scaly skin,* or *tentacles*. Beast eyes grant *lightless vision* with a range of 60’ but impose a -2 penalty to reaction rolls. Claw-like nails grant two attacks per round dealing 1d4-1 points of damage, but impose a -2 penalty to reaction rolls and a -2 penalty on proficiency throws requiring delicate work. Scaly skin grants a +2 AC, but reduces maximum movement rate by 25% and imposes a -4 penalty on reaction rolls. Tentacles allow the character to hold torches or other objects while keeping his hands free and grant two attacks per round dealing 1d3-1 points of damage, but impose a -2 penalty to reaction rolls. Judges who own ***AX1: The Sinister Stone of Sakkara*** can allow the character to select other Abominable Mutations from that book if desired. [Elven Wizard, Zaharan Sorcerer]

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Market Class** | **Max Capital / Month** |
| I | 100,000gp\* |
| II | 25,000gp |
| III | 10,000gp |
| IV | 5,000gp |
| V | 2,000gp |
| VI | 1,000gp |
| \*Per 20,000 families | |

**Access to Capital:** The character can borrow money from the merchant guild at an interest rate of 3% per month without collateral or at an interest rate of 1% per month with collateral. There is no limit to how much he can borrow in total, but each market only has a limited pool of capital for use each month, shown on the adjoining table. If the character fails to pay interest each month, he becomes disreputable in that market. While disreputable, he cannot use his mercantile network or friendly merchant connections. If the venturer allows interest payments to build up such that he owes more in gp than his total XP, then his former business partners will begin to send rival adventurers after him, with wages by level that total the monthly interest payment. A henchman will not use this ability on behalf of his employer, but a player character can do so on behalf of his fellow party members. To select this custom power, a class must have the **mercantile network** power. [Venturer II]

**Accuracy:** The character gains an accuracy bonus of +1 to all attack throws with missile weapons. [Elven Ranger]

**Acrobatics**: The character is trained to jump, tumble, somersault, and free-run around obstacles. He gains a +2 to saving throws where agility would help avoid the danger, such as tilting floors and pit traps. He can add his class level to his DEX for purposes of the distance and height he can jump (p. XX). In lieu of moving during a round, he can attempt a proficiency throw to tumble past an opponent in melee. At 1st level the character must make a proficiency throw of 18+ to succeed. The proficiency throw required reduces by 1 per level. If the throw fails, the character remains stationary. If it succeeds, he tumbles directly past his enemy, ending up either facing towards or away from him (player’s choice). If he ends up facing away, he can complete a combat movement in lieu of attacking if desired. If he ends up facing towards the opponent, he can attack the opponent from the rear. If he has Backstabbing class power, he can backstab the opponent. Characters wearing medium or heavy armor or with an encumbrance of more than 5 stone cannot tumble. [Beastmaster, Cultist of Atlach-Nacha, Elven Nightblade, Fool]

**Adhesive Toe Pads:** The character can climb on most walls or other vertical surfaces at 1/2 speed without need for a proficiency throw. He can climb on any sheer surface (such as glass) or walk on ceilings at 1/4 speed by succeeding on a proficiency throw to climb walls as a thief of his level. *This custom power counts as 2 powers*. [Geckoman]

**After the Flesh:** The character grows in power if he becomes undead. For a full a description of this power, see the Zaharan Custom Classes section above. *This power counts as 1 power when selected by a human custom class; but if the Judge creates a new race to which he assigns this power, it should count as 3 powers.* [Anti-Paladin, Sorcerer, Zaharans]

**Ageless:** See **longeval**.

**Alertness:** The character gains a +1 bonus to avoid surprise. When using Adventuring proficiency to search or listen, he succeeds on a proficiency throw of 14+ (instead of the usual 18+). If separately proficient in Searching or Listening, he gain a +2 bonus to his throw instead. This is effectively the Alertness proficiency selected as a custom power. For flavor, mystics and veildancers call this power **mindfulness,** Nephilim call it **alien senses**,and bugmen call it **keen insect senses**. [Bugmen, Mystic, Nephilim, Nobiran Veildancer]

**Alien Beings:** See **inhumanity**.

**Alien Intuition:** The character can achieve on-the-spot understanding of alien technology on a proficiency throw of 11+, and only suffers mishaps on an unmodified roll of 1. The character gains a +1 bonus on all research throws related to alien technology. *This custom power counts as 2 powers.* [Nephilim]

**Alien Lore:** The character can achieve on-the-spot understanding of alien weapons, armor, and chemicals on a proficiency throw of 7+, and only suffer mishaps on an unmodified roll of 1 in those categories. *This custom power counts as 3 powers.* [Nephilim]

**Alien Senses:** See **alertness**.

**Alluring Beauty:** See **glamorous aura**.

**Ambushing:** When the character attacks with surprise using melee weapons or using missile weapons at short range, he gets a +4 bonus on his attack throws and deals an extra die of damage on the attack. This is effectively the Ambushing proficiency, selecting as a custom power. [Cultist of Atlach-Nacha, Explorer, Gnomish Trickster]

**Analyze Data**: The character can analyze datato help determine the most favorable course of action. Analyzing data requires one turn (10 minutes) and the character must have access to a multiscanner. Analyzing data will provide the character with useful information regarding a question concerning a specific goal, event, or activity that is to occur within one week. The future is ever-changing, so if the character does not act on the information, it will quickly become useless. To successfully analyze data the character must make a proficiency throw of 8+. The proficiency throw is reduced by to 7+ at 9th level and 6+ at 12th level. Since over-analysis is never fruitful, the character can analyze data no more than once per day. [Terran Starman]

A**ncient Pacts:** The character gains a +1 bonus to reaction rolls when encountering intelligent chaotic monsters. Intelligent chaotic monsters suffer a -2 penalty to saving throws against any enchantment spells cast by the character. For flavor, cultist of Nabu call this power **horrible truths** while elven cultists of Iskara call it **chthonic hegemon**.[Cultist of Nabu, Elven Cultist, Zaharans]

**Animal Companion:** See **totem animal**.

**Animal Friendship:** Whenever the character builds a fastness, all ordinary animals within 3 miles of the stronghold become kind and helpful. Beastmasters call this power **fellowship of animals** while wizards call it **steward of the wild**. *This custom power only counts as 1/2 a power if selected.* [Beastmaster, Elven Courtier, Elven Ranger, Elven Spellsword, Elven Spellsinger, Elven Warlord, Elven Wizard, Nobiran Wizard, Wizard]

**Animal Magnetism:** See **battlefield prowess**.

**Animal Reflexes:** The character gains a +1 bonus on to initiative rolls and a +1 bonus to avoid surprise. This does not provide a bonus to casting spells. While Animal Reflexes is similar to taking the Combat Reflexes proficiency selected as a custom power, for game balance reasons, consider Animal Reflexes as a separate custom power and allow it to stack with Combat Reflexes. For flavor, mystics call this power **speed of thought**, halfling bounders call it **nervous watchfulness**,and Zaharan ruinguards call it **quickening**. [Barbarian, Beastmaster, Explorer, Elven Ranger, Halfling Bounder, Mystic, Zaharan Ruinguard]

**Antennae for Potions:** The character may make a proficiency throw of 11+ to determine the magical properties of a potion or oil based on its scent and emanations. A reduced-cost variant of **nose for potions**. [Bugman Ovate]

**Arcane Dabbling:** The character can attempt to use wands, staffs, and other magic items only useable by mages. The character does not need to know the command word for the item, but he must make a proficiency throw of 4+ or the attempt backfires with potentially disastrous consequences. This is effectively the Arcane Dabbling proficiency selected as a custom power. [Bard, Cultist of Nabu]

**Arcane Striking:** When the character successfully strikes a target with a melee attack, he can expend one of his daily spell slots to increase damage. Damage is increased by 1d6 per level of the spell slot expended. Damage dealt by arcane striking counts as extraordinary damage. If the target is slain by his arcane strike, the character is eligible to cleave as if he had slain the target in melee*. This custom power counts as 1 power at Arcane Value 1-2 and 2 powers at Arcane Value 3-4.* [Zaharan Ruinguard]

**Arena Reputation:** See **battlefield prowess**.

**Armor Training:** The character gains proficiency in armor one weight category heavier than normally permitted by his class without penalty. Armor Training does not grant the character the ability to use thief skills in medium or heavy armor, nor to benefit from proficiencies or class powers that require light, very light, or no armor. This is effectively the Armor Training proficiency selected as a class power. [Chosen, Elven Warlord, Nobiran Champion]

**Artificial Youth:** See **longeval.**

**Attunement to Nature:** The character gains a +1 bonus to surprise rolls when in the wilderness.When using the Adventuring proficiency to search or listen, they succeed on a proficiency throw of 14+ (instead of the usual 18+). If separately proficient in Searching they gain a +2 bonus to their throw instead. If separately proficient in Listening, they gain a +4 bonus to their throw instead. *This custom power counts as 1 1/2 powers if selected.* [Elves, Nobiran Wizard, Wizard]

**Avoid Getting Lost:** See **pathfinding**.

**Awareness of the Earth:** By spending one turn (10 minutes) visually examining an area of up to 10,000 square feet, and making a successful proficiency throw of 11+, the character can detect dangerous sinkholes, deadfalls, collapses, or rock slides. He can attempt to assess the land value of a hex to determine if it is worth settling. Finally, the character can attempt to assess the total number of lairs in the hex based on the lay of the land, evidence of cultivation, and other factors. This is effectively the Land Surveying proficiency, selected as a custom power. [Elven Cultist of Telith]

**Aura of Protection:** The character has a +1 bonus to AC and a +1 bonus on saving throws against attacks made or effects created by evil (or, alternatively, good) creatures. The character’s aura of protection appears as a golden halo (or, alternatively, a tenebrous shroud) when viewed with *discern good*, *discern magic*, or *true seeing*. [Anti-Paladin, Nobiran Wizard, Paladin, Wizard]

**Baleful Transformation:** The character can, through an unholy ritual of sacrifice to the Chaotic gods Dagon and Rahab, transform into a deep one. If and when they complete their transformation into full deep ones, the character retains his class abilities and may continue to level and grow in HD and in power. The character can then continue play as a deep one. [Deep One Hybrid]

**Ballistics Expertise:** The character attacks as a fighter of his class level when crewing ballista, catapults, trebuchets, or ranged automaton weapons. He deals +1 damage at 1st level with ballista, catapults, or ranged automaton weapons, and an additional +1 at 3rd, 6th, and 9th level. *This custom power counts as 3 powers if selected.* [Dwarven Machinist]

**Battle Magic:** The character gains a +1 initiative bonus when casting spells. When casting spells that require an attack throw, his attack throw is determined using the fighter progression. (If the character already uses the fighter progression, he gains a further +1 to hit.) This is effectively the Battle Magic proficiency, selected as a custom power. [Elven Cultist of Bel]

**Battlefield Prowess:** Any henchmen and mercenaries hired by the character gain a +1 bonus to their morale score whenever he personally leads them. For flavor, barbarians, beastmasters, and berserkers call this **animal magnetism**, dragons incarnate call it **greatness of soul**, dwarven pugilists call it **eye of the tige**r, lizardman gladiators call it **arena reputation**,runemakers call it **widespread renown**, and warmistresses call it **fiery spirit**. [Barbarian, Beastmaster, Berserker, Dragon Incarnate, Elven Warlord, Fighter, Lizardman Gladiator, Nobiran Champion, Runemaker, Thrassian Deathchanter, Thrassian Gladiator, Warlord]

**Battle Plan:** See **inspire courage**.

**Bedazzling Glamour**: The character has learned how to use magical glamour to conceal imperfections. While active, the glamour grants three benefits:

* The character gains a +1 bonus to all reaction rolls. This bonus does not stack with Mystic Aura (though other effects do).
* The character does not suffer any age-related penalty to CHA.
* Permanent wounds or side effects that otherwise would cause a penalty to reaction rolls are ignored.

Activating the glamour demands one turn (10 minutes) of concentration by the character. Once activated, the glamour remains active until the character ends it, is subject to a **dispel** effect, or is incapacitated. While the glamour is active, the character radiates magic. [Chthonic Witch]

**Berserkergang, Greater:** The character can enter a killing rage.The character can enter a greater berserkergangonce per day. (A character who selects ranks of the Berserkergang proficiency increases the number of times per day he can enter greater berserkergang by one per rank.) Entering a greater berserkergang requires a full-round action, during which time the character works himself into a frenzy, biting on his shield, foaming at the mouth, and howling like a wild animal. While in a greater berserkergang, the character gains a +2 bonus to attack throws and damage rolls and becomes immune to fear. Additionally, the character decreases the damage from any non-magical attacks by 1 point per die. (Damage can be reduced to 0, but not less than 0, on each die. Attacks from monsters of 5 HD or more are considered magical attacks due to the monster’s ferocity.)

This protection increases to 2 points per die at 7th level and 3 points per die at 13th level. However, a character in a state of greater berserkergang becomes limited in his tactics (as per the Berserkergang proficiency) and has trouble distinguishing friend from foe. If a character in a greater berserkergang rolls a natural 1 on an attack throw, he automatically hits a nearby ally within 5’ in lieu of his preferred target. Once begun, a greater berserkergang cannot be ended until combat ends. When the greater berserkergang ends, the character is immediately **fatigued** and **winded** until he rests for 1 turn (10 minutes). This power can only be selected by a class that takes Lesser Berserkergang as a class power. [Berserker]

**Berserkergang, Lesser:** The character can enter a killing rage. While enraged, he gains a +2 bonus to attack throws and becomes immune to fear. However, the character has a -2 penalty to AC and becomes limited in his tactics. He cannot conduct defensive movement to retreat or withdraw from an enemy within 5’ and cannot move in such a way that the range between himself and the nearest visible threat would increase. He must advance 5’ after cleaving if necessary to do so to engage an enemy and he has sufficient movement. Once it has begun, a berserker rage cannot be ended until combat ends. This is effectively the Berserkergang proficiency, selected as a custom power. For flavor, bugmen praetors call this power **killing spree** and cultists of Qetesh call it **bestial fury**. [Berserker, Bugman Praetor, Cultist of Qetesh]

**Bestial Cry:** Once per day, the character can shout a bestial crythat can be heard up to 750’ away. Hostile ordinary animals hearing the cry must immediately make a morale roll. Other ordinary animals hearing the cry may come to his assistance. If the animal is friendly to the character (e.g. if it is a henchman, a trained animal, or resident within 3 miles of his encampment) it will automatically run or fly to his assistance as quickly as possible. Otherwise, you should make a reaction roll for each animal, with a Friendly result indicating the creature comes to the character’s assistance. [Beastmaster]

**Bestial Fury:** See **berserkergang, lesser**.

**Blade-Dancing:** The character gains a +1 bonus to Armor Class if wearing light, very light, or no armor, and carrying 5 stones or less encumbrance. At level 7, the AC bonus increases to +2, and at level 13 the AC bonus increases to +3. For flavor, mystics and warmistresses call this power **graceful fighting**, mog brutes call it **pugilism**, and pugilists (just to be confusing) call it **legwork**. While Blade-Dancing is similar to taking the Swashbuckling proficiency selected as a custom power, for game balance reasons, consider Blade-Dancing as a separate custom power and allow it to stack with Swashbuckling as noted in that proficiency. [Bladedancer, Mystic, Nobiran Veildancer, Pugilist, Warmistress]

**Blessing of the Dead:** See **divine health**.

**Blindsight:** The character can see to a range of 60’, regardless of light sources, magical darkness, or other visual phenomena. However, blindsight is useless in Windy conditions. *Blindsight counts as 2 1/2 custom powers.* [Bugmen]

**Blood of Kings:** The blood of ancient kings and heroes flows in the character. The character may hire one more henchman than his Charisma would otherwise permit, and the base loyalty score of any henchmen is increased by 1. Chosen call this power **scion of kings** while dragon incarnate call it **soul of the dragon**. [Chosen, Dragon Incarnate, Nobirans]

**Bloody Healing:** The character does not heal naturally. Instead, it can only heal by magical means, or by consuming the flesh or blood of living or recently-dead sentient beings. The character can recover 1d6 hit points by eating the flesh of a recently slain sapient creature of at least 1 HD. Alternatively, it can drink the blood of a living creature, causing 1d4 points of damage per round and restoring that amount to its own hit points, up to a maximum of half the target's hit points. [Revenant]

**Bone-Breaking Strength:** The character does 1d6-2 points of damage with his unarmed attacks, and can make two attacks per round when unarmed. When the character reaches 5th level, his natural attacks deal extraordinary damage. *This custom power counts as 2 powers if selected.* [Mog Brute]

**Bonus Languages:** The character begins play speaking four bonus languages. Venturers call this power **multilingual**.[Dwarves, Elves, Gnomes, Halflings, Katripol, Zaharans, Nobiran Champion, Nobiran Veildancer, Venturer II]

**Boon Companion:**Whenever an ally within 30’ makes an attack throw, proficiency throw, or saving throw, the character may spend a Fate Point to allow the ally to re-roll the throw. The character can spend additional Fate Points to allow further re-rolls if desired. However, the ally can never re-roll a natural 1. [Chosen]

**Brewing Quacksalves:** The character can brew quacksalves as a mountebank (see ***AXIOMS*** *5*). [Mountebank]

**Bribery**: The character gains a +1 bonus to reaction rolls if he offers one day’s pay for the target; a +2 bonus for a week’s pay; and a +3 bonus for a month’s pay. His bribery is so subtle that the attempt is politely deniable by both parties. The character is only blatant enough to be charged with the crime of bribery if he rolls an unmodified 2 on 2d6.. This is effectively the Bribery proficiency, selected as a custom power. [Cultist of Moloch, Venturer, Venturer II]

**Bright Lore:** The character can rebuke undead as a crusader of one half his class level (rounded up). If the character casts spells that require a Paralysis saving throw, his targets suffer a -2 penalty on the save. When the character casts protection spells (including dispels), the spell effects are calculated as if he were two caster levels higher than his actual caster level. His eligibility to research protection magic is determined as if he were two caster levels higher than actual. He gains a +2 bonus on magic research throws and increases his research rate by 10% when researching protection magic. While this is effectively Bright Lore of Aura proficiency selected as a custom power, consider Bright Lore as a separate custom power and allow it to stack with the proficiency, such that the character can rebuke undead as a crusader of two-thirds his class level (rounded up), and his protection spells and research are calculated as if he were three (rather than two) caster levels higher than his actual caster level. [Nobiran Wizard, Wizard]

**Broad Spectrum Inoculations:** See **divine health**.

**Brutality:** When unarmed, the character can perform the Wrestling, Knock Down, and Sunder special maneuvers at no attack penalty, representing his great might and brutality in hand-to-hand combat. *This custom power counts as 3 powers if selected.* [Mog Brute]

**Cast the Runes:** The character spends one round casting the runes and then receive an **augury** (as the spell) about what fate has in store. The character must have access to runic implements in order to cast the runes, and he can do so only once every 8 hours. (Note that “casting” in this context is analogous to the casting of dice, not the casting of spells). [Runemaker]

**Ceremonial Magic:** The character has learned the ceremonies of a particular tradition of ceremonial magic (antiquarian, liturgical, runic, sylvan, shamanic, or theurgical). The character must choose the tradition at the time he chooses the custom power. When this custom power is selected, the character becomes a 1st level ceremonialist with a repertoire of one 1st level ceremony. He can perform ceremonies in the tradition and create and use trinkets and talismans in the tradition as a 1st level ceremonialist, and can identify trinkets or talismans created by a ceremonialist of the tradition with a proficiency throw of 11+ and of other traditions with an 18+. This custom power can be selected multiple times. Each subsequent time it is selected, the character can either reduce the proficiency throw required to identify trinkets and talismans of a tradition he already knows by 4; learn another tradition; add one ceremony (of any level he can perform) to his repertoire; or increase his ceremonialist caster level by two, up to a maximum of his class level. Spells learned from other custom powers (such as Eldritch Talent) are not included in the character’s repertoire of ceremonies. [Chosen, Zaharan Sorcerer]

**Charismatic Ferocity:** When attacking with tiny, small, or medium weapons, the character can apply his CHA modifier instead of his STR modifier to his damage rolls. [Warmistress]

**Child-Like:** See **inhumanity**.

**Chitinous Carapace:** See **scaly hide**.

**Chosen Weapon:**The character can designate a particular individual weapon as his chosen weapon. The chosen weapon must be given a name (e.g. “Excalibur” or “Anduril”). When the character wields his chosen weapon, it is treated as if its magical bonus to attack and damage were 1 point greater. This custom power can be selected multiple times, but no more than once at 1st to 4th level, twice at 5th to 9th level, and thrice at 10th level and above. Each time it is selected the character can increase the bonus of his chosen weapon or designate an additional weapon as a chosen weapon. [Chosen]

**Chronicles of Battle:** Any henchmen and mercenaries hired by the character gain a +1 bonus to their morale score if the character is there to witness and record their deeds. [Bard]

**Chthonic Hegemon:** See **ancient pacts**.

**Clarion Commander:** When the character issues a call to arms to his vassals, he can ask them to muster their full garrison without provoking a Henchman Morale roll. When the character levies the peasant militia of his domain, or when his vassals levy their militias in response to his call to arms, morale of the domain does not suffer a penalty. All militia levied by the herald, or by his vassals in response to the character’s call to arms, gain a +1 bonus to their morale scores, for the duration of the call. (This bonus does not stack if both the ruler and a vassal have this power.) [Nobiran Champion]

**Classical Weapons Training:** See **martial talent**.

**Claws and Bite:** The character gains a claw/claw/bite attack routine. When the character reaches 5th level, his natural attacks count as silver weapons. When the character reaches 9th level, his natural attacks deal extraordinary damage. *This custom power counts as 2 or more custom powers if selected, depending on the damage of the claws and bite*. [Cultist of Bokrug, Thrassian Gladiator]

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Cost** | **Claw Damage** | **Bite Damage** |
| 2 powers | 1d2-1 | 1d4-1 |
| 3 powers | 1d3-1 | 1d6-1 |
| 4 powers | 1d3-1 | 1d8-1 |
| 5 powers | 1d4-1 | 1d8-1 |
| 6 powers | 1d4-1 | 1d10-1 |

**Cleansing Touch:**By touching a creature and spending a Fate Point, the character can instantly remove a curse or dispel a harmful magical effect. The character must be of equal or greater level than the spellcaster who cast the curse or effect. [Chosen]

**Close Friend of Birds and Beasts:** The character can *speak with beasts* (as the spell) at will. If, while speaking with small, cute animals such as songbirds, squirrels, and rabbits, the character ever rolls Friendly reactions, the animals act as if *bewitched* in his presence. A class must have Beast Friendship or an equivalent class power before adding this class power. [Sylvan Witch]

**Comfort and Console the Wounded**: The character can help the faithful to better endure pain and suffering while they heal. Each use of the ability requires 1 turn (10 minutes), during which the target creature is reassured through prayer and pastoral guidance. Once comforted and consoled, the creature’s base healing rate from resting is doubled for the next day. A character cannot comfort and console wounded creatures of a different alignment or religion, nor can he comfort and console creatures of animal intelligence. This ability only applies to healing from resting. It does not stack with the effects of the *salving rest*spell nor with rallying the faithful. [Ecclesiastic]

**Command of Voice:** The character gains a +1 bonus to reaction rolls with creatures he speaks to. If this bonus results in a total of 12 or more, the subjects act as if *bewitched* while in his presence. Creatures with a WIL greater than the character’s CHA are immune to this power (and the character will know they are immune). This power is a slightly modified version of the Mystic Aura proficiency. For flavor, dragon incarnates call this power **majesty of the dragon.** See also **glamorous aura**. [Dragon Incarnate, Mystic, Nobiran Veildancer]

**Command Undead:** The character can command undead as a Chaotic crusader of half his level. [Anti-Paladin]

**Commune with Ancestral Spirits:** The character can commune with spirits. He can choose between the ancestral spirits of his tribe, or the natural spirits of his current location. The spirits will answer three yes-or-no questions to the best of their ability. They are very wise regarding their tribal history or local area, but not omniscient, so they might not be able to answer some questions accurately. Such details are left to your discretion. The ritual to commune with the ancestor spirits takes 1 turn to complete, during which time the shaman is “out of body” and entirely helpless. The ritual is so taxing that it can be performed but once per week. Once a year, on a particular sacred day (determined by you, the Judge), the shaman can ask twice the normal number of questions of his ancestors without angering them. Communing with the spirits in a sinkhole of evil is a dangerous and chaotic act that might violate his code of behavior or put him at risk of haunting or possession (Judge’s discretion). [Geckoman Spirit-Talker, Shaman]

**Compel Submission:** Once per hour, the character can cast *word of command* (as the 1st level divine spell) with a casting time of 1 round. Creatures charmed with **glamorous aura** or related powers suffer a -4 penalty on saving throws against this effect. [Priestess of Nasga]

**Concealed from Undead:** The character is always considered to be in dim light or cover for purposes of hiding from undead. When the character sneaks, the range at which undead can see him with lightless vision is halved. [Blessed Undertaker]

**Conduit to the Esoteric:** This power can only be selected by a character who gains a familiar as a custom power. Select two 1st and one 2nd level black magic spell of each level that the character has not yet added to his repertoire. When the familiar is within 30’ of the character, he can treat those spells as if they were in his repertoire. (If the character later adds those spells to his actual repertoire, the familiar can become a conduit to new spells instead.) [Zaharan Sorcerer]

**Conjure Dark Powers (1st level):** When the character casts summoning spells (such as*conjure fiend*or *summon**shadows*), the spell effects are calculated as if he were two caster levels higher than his actual level of experience. (This makes them harder to dispel.) If the character loses his concentration due to taking damage while controlling a conjured creature, he must make a Spell saving throw. If the save succeeds, he maintains his concentration. His eligibility to conduct research on summoning magic is determined as if he were two caster levels higher than actual. He gains a +2 bonus on magic research throws and increases his research rate by 10% when researching summoning magic. Conjure Dark powers can stack with the Mastery of Conjuration and Summoning proficiency, such that the character’s summoning spells are calculated as if he were three (rather than two) caster levels higher and he gains a +2 bonus on his Spells save to maintain concentration. [Warlock]

**Connection to Nature:** The character is unaffected by diseases caused by undead, gains a +1 bonus on HD rolls at 1st level, and gain a +1 bonus on Paralysis and Spells saving throws. For flavor, revenants call this **relentless**.[Elves, Revenant]

**Consume Souls:** Once per month the character may cast *soul eating* (as the 6th level spell) with a casting time of 1 turn (10 minutes). Creatures *bewitched* with the character’s special abilities suffer a -4 penalty on saving throws against this effect. [Priestess of Nasga]

**Contact Dark Powers:** The character can cast *contact other sphere*once per week. It takes 1 turn (10 minutes) to cast. This is effectively the Soothsaying proficiency, selected as a custom power. [Geckoman Warlock, Occultist, Sorcerer, Warlock]

**Courage:**See **strength of spirit.**

**Create Advanced Technology:** The character can create advanced technological items similar in power to Visitor technology as if they were magical items. Technological items of a non-consumable nature will require energy crystals as a special component, while consumable technological items will require energy crystals to power them. [Terran Engineer]

**Cunning and Flexible Reconnoiter**: The character excels in scouting and screening the enemy. Whenever the character is commander of the scouting or screening units in an army, or its overall leader, the army treats any opposing army as if it were one row more proximate on the Results of Reconnaissance Rolls table. If the opposing army is already in the same 6-mile hex, then the army treats its degree of success as one column better instead. Any opposing army treats the character’s army as if it were one row less proximate for reconnaissance results, or if already at maximum distance, as if its degree of success were one column worse. [Nobiran Champion]

**Curse with Ill Fate:** Once per day, the character can curse an enemy with ill fate, either by chanting the curse or activating a curse-pole, as per a runemaker. [Runemaker]

**Daredevil:** See **strength of spirit**.

**Dark Blessing:** See **divine blessing**.

**Dark Charisma:** Any chaotic characters or monsters in the character’s service gain a +1 bonus to their morale score whenever he personally leads them. [Zaharan Ruinguard]

**Deadly Additive:** The character can create deadly additives such as venoms and toxins. Creating a deadly additive requires the ability to perform ceremonies. Creating a deadly additive requires one turn and the use of the character’s traditional implements, and causes the character to gain 1 stigma. The additive can be applied to a weapon or ingested. If applied to a weapon, the weapon deals additional damage on its next successful attack within one hour. If ingested, the creature that ingested it takes damage immediately. The additive will magically resist dilution, and only a single creature can be harmed by ingesting it. In either case, the damage dealt is equal to 1d6 per level of the highest-level ceremony the character can cast, with no saving throw permitted. If not applied or ingested, the additive will retain its potency until the alchemist recovers stigma. A character can have only one deadly additive crafted at a time. [Gnomish Alchemist]

**Death-Dealing Dance:** While performing a death-dealing dance, the character is a whirlwind of flashing blades and swirling garb, gaining one bonus melee or thrown attack each round and dealing 1d6 bonus damage with every successful melee or thrown attack (including cleaves). Entering a death-dealing dance requires a full-round action during which time the character begins the ritual steps of the dance. Once begun, a death-dealing dance continues until either all visible enemies are slain, the character is incapacitated, the character chooses to end the dance, or 1 turn elapses, whichever comes first. A character can perform a death-dealing dance once per day. [Warmistress]

**Death Healing:** When the character successfully slays a sentient creature with a melee attack, he can expend a spell slot to heal himself. Healing is 1d6 per level of the spell slot expended, to a maximum value equal to the slain victim's maximum (starting) hit points. The character can cleave after death healing if he has any cleaves remaining. *This custom power counts as 1 power with Arcane Value 1-2 and 2 powers with Arcane Value 3-4.* [Zaharan Ruinguard]

**Deathly Visage:** The character suffers a -2 on reaction rolls vs. any non-Chaotic beings and enjoys +2 to reaction rolls with Chaotic beings. *This custom power counts as 0 custom powers if selected.* [Revenant]

**Deciphering:** The character gains the ability to decipher tex**t**(including ciphers, treasure maps, and dead languages, but not magical writings). Deciphering a page of text requires one turn (10 minutes) and a successful proficiency throw of 4+ on 1d20. If the roll does not succeed, the character cannot try to decipher that particular page of text until he reaches a higher level of experience. [Bard, Loremaster, Mountebank, Nobiran Wizard, Venturer, Wizard]

**Demand Surrender:** As an action in lieu of moving or attacking, the character can demand surrender from a group of hostile creatures. The group can be of any size, but the creatures must be able to see, hear, and understand the character, and must be either outnumbered or surprised by the character and his allies in order to be affected. Affected creatures must make an immediate morale roll with a penalty equal to the character’s CHA bonus. A result of Retreat will lead to their immediate surrender. If the demand fails, a character cannot demand surrender from the same creature or creatures again until other circumstances have triggered a morale roll by the creature or creatures. This ability can be used at the start of a large-scale battle if the opposing army is surprised or outnumbered by the character’s army. [Nobiran Champion]

**Demi-Human Ancestry:** The character gains a +1 bonus on Paralysis and Spells saving throws. *This custom power counts as 1/2 custom power if selected.* [Halflings]

**Design, Build, and Repair Automatons:** The character can design, build, and repair automatons, following the procedures detailed in the dwarven machinist class. Terran engineers refer to this as **design, build, and repair ingenious devices**.*This custom power counts as 3 powers if selected.* [Dwarven Machinist, Terran Engineer]

**Design, Build, and Repair Ingenious Devices:** See **design, build, and repair automatons**.

**Destined:**The character gains two Fate Points. This custom power may be selected multiple times. [Chosen]

**Detachable Tail:** The character has a detachable regenerating tail. If the character is dealt a mortal wound, he can sacrifice his tail. Sacrificing the tail grants a +20 bonus on the character’s subsequent roll on the Mortal Wounds table. However, his tail is important to the character’s health and balance, and as long as he is tail-less, he suffers a -2 penalty to his Dexterity and Constitution scores. Regeneration of the character’s tail takes 2d3 months. [Geckomen]

**Detect Good:** See **discern good.**

**Detect Evil:** See **discern evil.**

**Detect Traps:** This power, which offered a partial version of a thief’s searching abilities, has been removed from ***ACKS II****.* In lieu of this power, the dwarven power **sensitivity to rock and stone** has been made more powerful. [Dwarves]

**Determined:**The character can spend a Fate Point after making an attack throw, proficiency throw, or saving throw to set the result of the throw to 10 (instead of re-rolling). The character cannot spend a Fate Point in this manner if the original roll was a natural 1, however. [Chosen]

**Difficult to Corrupt:** The character suffers only 1/2 the usual amount of Corruption from spending time in sinkholes of evil, using evil magic items, or from the effects of corrupting dreams. [Halflings]

**Difficult to Spot:** This power, which offered a partial version of a thief’s hiding abilities, has been removed from ***ACKS II****.* The character with this power should be assigned the **natural stealth** power instead. If the character already has that power, replace it with another class power. [Beastmaster, Explorer, Geckoman, Elven Ranger, Halfling Bounder, Nobiran Champion]

**Divine Blessing:** The character gains a +2 bonus to all saving throws. This is effectively the Divine Blessing proficiency, selected as a custom power. For flavor, dragons incarnate call this power **dragon’s luck**, gnome alchemists call it **hearty constitution**,mystics call it **harmony of spirit**, Nobirans call it **favor of the gods**, and elven cultists and Zaharan ruinguards call this **dark blessing**. [Elven Cultist of Iskara, Gnome Alchemist, Mystic, Nobirans, Zaharan Ruinguard]

**Divine Health:** The character is immune to all forms of disease, including magical diseases caused by spells, mummies, or lycanthropes. This is effectively the Divine Health proficiency selected as a custom power. For flavor, dwarven sporecasters call this power **fungal humors**,mystics call it **purity of body and soul**, necromancers call it **blessing of the dead**, paladins call it **sanctified body**, and Terran starmen call it **broad-spectrum inoculations**. [Dwarven Sporecaster, Mystic, Paladin, Nobirans, Terran Starman]

**Divine Proficiency***:* The character can select one class proficiency, choosing from Divine Blessing, Divine Health, Laying on Hands, Prophecy, and Sensing Evil. This custom power can be selected multiple times, selecting an additional proficiency each time, to a maximum limit of three selections. Note that some proficiencies available with this custom power are not useful unless the character has selected the Eldritch Talent custom power or is a caster. [Chosen]

**Discern Good:** This is effectively the Sensing Evil proficiency, but reversed and selected as a custom power. [Anti-Paladin]

**Discern Evil:** The character can detect creatures with evil intentions, magic items with evil enchantments, undead, sinkholes of evil, and summoned creatures of Chaotic alignment within 30’. (Normal characters, even if Chaotic, are not detected unless they have actively evil intentions against the character. Poisons, physical traps, and natural animals are neither good nor evil, so they are not detected by this spell. The character sees the evil creatures or objects with a sinister red glow around them, but the glow cannot be seen by anyone else. The character must have line of sight on the evil (e.g. the power does not work through walls). If the creature or object is hidden or invisible, the character will only see the glow and not the source of the evil. Sensing evil requires one full round of quiet concentration to activate. The effect lasts as long as the character continues to concentrate, to a maximum of one round per level. The effect can be used once per turn (10 minutes). This is effectively the Sensing Evil proficiency, selected as a custom power. [Paladin]

**Distract:** The character has learned a series of physical tricks, confusing nonsense, or baffling patter so profound or confusing that it serves to preternaturally distract creatures. Up to 1d6 living creatures within 30’ of the character may be affected. Creatures with the fewest HD are affected first. Each affected creature must make a Spells saving throw. Creatures already engaged in an extremely stressful or life-threatening situation (such as combat) gain a +4 bonus to saving throws to resist the distraction. Those that fail the saving throw are **mesmerized** by the antics of the character, and automatically can be surprised by naturally stealthy, hiding, or sneaking characters. The character can attempt this sort of distraction no more than once every 8 hours. [Fool]

**Dominate Beastmen:** By calling upon his implacable will and magical strength, the character can command the vile minions of Chaos to do his bidding. The character must be visible to the beastmen and be able to speak a language they understand in order to dominate them. The potency of this ability is determined by level, as noted in the Zaharan Darklord class. [Zaharan Darklord]

**Dragon’s Luck:** See **divine blessing**.

**Dragon’s Resilience:** See **savage resilience**.

**Dread Shadow:** This custom power requires that the character have the ability to **inspire dread**. It allows the character to inspire dread in any enemy unit which he can specifically identify (e.g. “the Golden Company of The Syrnasos” or “the cataphract squadron of Legate Valerian”) regardless of range. The character can likewise instill strength into any unit of dominated beastman or controlled undead under his control at any distance. The character is still limited in using these abilities no more than once per day per level. [Zaharan Darklord]

**Eldritch Talent:**The character manifests the ability to cast a spell at certain intervals. The spell selected can be of any level, up to the character’s level of experience. The spell is cast as if the character were of the minimum caster level for the spell or at his class level, whichever is greater. The frequency with which the character can cast is determined by the spells’ level. 1st – once per hour; 2nd – once per 8 hours; 3rd – once per day; 4th – once per week; 5th – once per month; 6th – once per year. The character does not have a spellbook and cannot change his repertoire. This custom power does not allow the character to use scrolls or magic items usable only by mages or crusaders. While called Eldritch Talent, the same rules apply to Arcane and Divine spells. This proficiency can be selected multiple times to gain the ability to cast additional spells. [Chosen; many other classes use a version of this to gain various spellcasting and spell-like abilities.]

**Eldritch Warrior:**When the character successfully strikes a target with a melee attack, he can expend a spell to increase damage. Damage is increased by 1d6 per level of the spell expended. Damage dealt this power counts as extraordinary arcane damage. The character must have gained spellcasting abilities from the Eldritch Talent custom power or be an eldritch caster before selecting this custom power. See also **arcane striking**.[Chosen]

**Elemental Connection:** Anytime the character is in his element, he can regain an expended spell slot with one hour (6 turns) of meditation. If in a minor place of elemental power for his element, the time required is reduced to 3 turns; in a major place of elemental power, 1 turn; and in a supreme place, 1 round. Up to one spell slot of each level can be recovered each day. For air, the character must be under open skies at the highest point within 6 miles. For earth, the character must be underground. For fire, the character must be at the site of a major fire. For water, the character must be immersed in a natural body of water such as a lake, river, or ocean. [Elven Cultist of Telith]

**Enchanted Forest**: The character can cast *forest enchantment*(as the spell) once per week. Each use takes 1 turn (10 minutes). The character can sustain a number of *forest enchantments* equal to his caster level, enabling him to enchant a vast swathe of territory (approximately 2 acres per level). [Sylvan Witch]

**Engineering Aptitude:** The character can repair technological devices in one-half the normal time for one-half the normal cost in spare parts. [Terran Starman]

**Evil Eye:** The character can hex a foe with the merest glance. He can *bestow curse* as a spell-like ability once per week. Because the Evil Eye is a spell-like ability and not a spell, he does not need to declare he is casting it before initiative, nor does taking damage or failing a saving throw prior to his initiative segment prevent him from using it. [Chthonic Witch]

**Experimentation:** The character gains a +1 bonus to magic research throws. Whenever the character engages in magic experimentation, the character gains an additional +1 bonus to the magic research throws. If the character experiences a mishap while experimenting, he can roll twice for the mishap and take whichever result he chooses. Note that this power is quite distinct from Experimenting proficiency. [Terran Engineer]

**Exquisite Torture:** The character can spend one turn (10 minutes) whipping, branding, or scarring a willing victim. An NPC under the influence of the character’s charms (from, e.g. alluring beauty, provoking the passions, or spells) will allow himself to be tortured if he fails a Spells saving throw. When the exquisite torture is complete, the character recovers hp equal to the amount of damage dealt to the victim, to a maximum of 60 hp. If the torturer chooses, he can leave the victim with one or more permanent scars, in exchange regaining one or more divine spell slots he has expended that day. By leaving a minor scar, he can regain a 1st or 2nd level spell slot. By leaving a major scar, he can regain a 3rd or 4th level spell slot. By leaving a grotesque scar, he can regain a 5th level spell slot. He can only regain one spell slot of each level per day. A character cannot benefit from exquisite torture if he has broken the strictures of his faith. [Priestess of Nasga]

**Experience and Hardiness:** Hirelings on a wilderness adventure led by this character gain a +1 bonus to their morale score. This bonus stacks with any modifiers from the explorer’s Charisma or proficiencies. [Explorer]

**Expert Bargaining**: Any items the character purchases cost 10% less than the listed price and any items he sells go for 10% more than the listed price. If trading with another venturer, or a character with the Bargaining proficiency,the opposed bargainers should make reaction rolls. Whichever character scores the higher result gets the discount. The character can select Bargaining proficiency to improve his skills. Each time the proficiency is selected, the character receives a +2 bonus on his reaction roll when negotiating with other bargainers. [Cultist of Moloch, Venturer]

**Expert Traveler:** The character begins play with their choice of Driving or Seafaring proficiency. [Venturer]

**Expert Scout:** When searching a hex, the character receives a searching throw to discover a lair every 30 minutes instead of every hour (or every 15 minutes if aerial). When first arriving in a hex, the character can attempt to assess the total number of lairs in the hex as if he had Land Surveying proficiency. If the character already has or later gains Land Surveying, this custom power stacks with the proficiency to grant the ranger a +4 bonus to his assessment throws. [Nobiran Champion]

**Extensive Firearms Training:** The character gains a +1 bonus to attack throws when using technological ranged weapons such as pistols, rifles, and launchers. [Terran Cosmonaut]

**Exult in Glorious Battle:** When the character slays a number of hit dice of creatures greater than or equal to twice his caster level in a single round, he can choose to release an exultant shout in lieu of cleaving. He must have at least one cleave left in the round to release an exultant shout. If he does so, the warlord recovers one point of stigma or stigma equivalent (e.g. confidence threshold). A character cab yell as many times as he wishes, but can recover stigma in this way only once between cleansings of stigma. [Warlord]

**Familial Loyalty:** The character can hire one more henchman than his Charisma would otherwise permit, and the base morale score of any henchmen is increased by 1, provided the henchman is related to him by blood or marriage. Any NPCs who are related to the character by blood or marriage gain a +1 bonus to their morale score when he is present. [Katripol]

**Familiar with Technology:** The character can achieve on-the-spot understanding of alien technology on a proficiency throw of 11+, and only suffers mishaps on a natural 1. *This custom power counts as 2 custom powers if selected.* [Terrans]

**Farseeing:** The character can see the fates of mortals. He can determine how many Fate Points a character has after 10 minutes (1 turn) of casual interaction or observation. Once per week, the character can cast *fate* (as the spell) with a casting time of 10 minutes (1 turn). [Chosen]

**Favor of the Gods:** See **divine blessing**.

**Fellowship of Animals**: See **animal friendship**.

**Fiery Spirit:** See **battlefield prowess**.

**Flagellation:** The character can conduct flagellation to whip himself into a furious religious zeal. He suffers 1 slashing damage per level of experience but gains a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls and becomes immune to fear. The character is limited in tactics (as per the Fighting Fury class power) while the effect lasts, and you can require the character to attack, to the best of his lethal ability, the nearest enemy of his faith, even if the player thinks this is not a prudent choice. The zealous fury lasts until the combat ends. Flagellation is a variant of **fighting fury** with a reduced cost. [Flagellant]

**Flawless Precision:** When conducting ordinary magic research (i.e. not using experimental methods), the character does not suffer automatic failures on unmodified die rolls of 2-3. An unmodified die roll of 1 is still an automatic failure, however. [Elven Wizard, Nobiran Wizard, Wizard]

**Flesh-Runes:** At 1st level, the character gains a +2 bonus to AC and decreases ordinary damage by 1 point per die. At 7th level, this protection increases to +4 AC and 2 points per die. At 13th level, the protection increases to +6 AC and 3 points per die. The damage reduction is applied per die. Damage can be reduced to 0, but not less than 0, on each die. The AC bonus from flesh-runes stacks with *potions of invulnerability*, *rings of protection*, and similar effects, but does not stack with armor. For flavor, flagellants call this power **stigmata** and revenants call it **profane endurance**. *This custom power counts as 3 custom powers if selected.* [Dwarven Fury, Flagellant, Revenant]

**Fiery Cauterization:** See **laying on hands**.

**Fiery Resistance:** The character is immune to ordinary fire damage and automatically succeeds on saving throws against spells or effects that deal mundane fire damage. The character is **resistant** to extraordinary fire damage. He reduces extraordinary fire damage dealt by half and gain a +2 bonus on saving throws against spells or special abilities that deal fire damage. [Dwarven Furnacewife]

**Fighting Fury:** At will, the character can enter a fighting fury. While furious, the character gains a +2 bonus to damage rolls and becomes immune to fear. However, the character becomes limited in his tactics. He cannot conduct defensive movement to retreat or withdraw from an enemy within 5’ and cannot move in such a way that the range between himself and the nearest visible threat would increase. He must advance 5’ after cleaving if necessary to do so to engage an enemy and he has sufficient movement. Once it has begun, a fighting fury cannot be ended until combat ends. *This custom power counts as 2 custom powers if selected.* [Dwarven Fury, Deep One Hybrid, Mog Brute, Pugilist]

**Fists of Iron:** The character gains a fist/fist attack routine. *This custom power counts as 2 or more custom powers if selected, depending on the damage of the fists*. Compare to **bone-breaking strength**, **claw and bite**, and **pugilism**.[Pugilist]

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Cost** | **Damage** |
| 2 powers | 1d3 |
| 3 powers | 1d4 |
| 4 powers | 1d6 |
| 5 powers | 1d8 |

**Flying:** The character gains a flying movement rate of 30’ per turn. *This custom power counts as 5 custom powers if selected.* [Thrassian Deathchanter]

**Fool’s Luck:** The character can spend an action to whisper a quick prayer or charm to grant himself fool’s luck. For the next 6 turns, an enemy attempting to attack or cast a spell upon the character will be foiled in the attempt and spare the character of any potential damage or malevolent effect. Until 6 turns have passed, the character can be spared 1d4 times before his luck is exhausted. Area-effect spells and area attacks cannot be protected against, nor will they exhaust any potential instances of fool’s luck the character currently possesses. Fool’s luck can be invoked no more than once every 8 hours. [Fool]

**Four Arms:** The character has four limbs available for manipulating objects and wielding weapons, and can fight with all four at once! The character can wield as many as four small one-handed weapons (such as hand axes and short swords), one per hand; three small-one handed weapons and possibly one shield; two small-one handed weapons and one or two shields; one two-handed medium or large weapon in one pair of hands and a shield or weapon in a third hand, or a pair of weapons or shields in the other hands; or a pair of two-handed medium or large weapons. The character cannot wield more than 2 shields at any one time, however.

The new fighting styles available to the character, and the benefits gained from Fighting Style proficiency, are shown on the accompanying table. The character can also use the ordinary fighting styles available to human fighters, as well (e.g. two weapon fighting). Note that the character only has one attack in its attack routine, regardless of how many weapons it carries. If the character class has a Fighting Value of less than 2, it does not get access to the new four-armed fighting styles unless it allocates some or all of its fighting style choices to them. If the four-armed character is equipped with magic weapons or shields, he can benefit from, at most, the attack bonus of two weapons, the damage bonus of one weapon, the AC bonus of one shield. *This custom power counts as 2 powers if selected.* [Bugman Praetor]

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Style** | **Base Bonus** | **Fighting Style Proficiency** |
| 1 small weapon & 2 shields | +2 to armor class (from 2 shields) | Additional +1 to armor class |
| 2 small weapons & shield | +1 to attack throws, +1 to armor class (from shield) | Additional +1 to armor class |
| 2 small weapons & 2 shields | +1 to attack throws, +2 to armor class (from 2 shields) | Additional +1 to armor class |
| 3 small weapons | +2 to attack throws | Additional +1 to attack throws |
| 3 small weapons & shield | +2 to attack throws, +1 to armor class (from shield) | Additional +1 to attack throws |
| 4 small weapons | +2 to attack throws, +1 to damage | Additional +1 to attack throws |
| 1 medium/large weapon & 1 shield | +1 to armor class (from shield), deal 1d8/1d10 | Additional +1 to armor class |
| 1 medium/large weapon & 2 shields | +2 to armor class (from 2 shields), deal 1d8/1d10 | Additional +1 to damage rolls |
| 1 md/lg. weapon, 1 small weapon, 1 shield | +1 to attack throws, +1 to armor class, deal 1d8/1d10 | Additional +1 to damage rolls |
| 2 medium/large weapons | +1 to attack throws, +1 to damage rolls, deal 1d8/1d10 | Additional +1 to damage rolls |

**Forbidden Spells:** The character can add one spell of each level from another magic type to his class list at their normal spell levels for that magic type. This does not increase his repertoire; it merely makes it possible to learn spells that are otherwise unavailable. For flavor, wizards call this **secret knowledge**.[Wizard]

**Friend of Birds and Beasts:** The character is well-schooled in the natural world. He can identify plants and fauna with a proficiency throw of 11+. He understands the vocalizations and body language of birds and beasts, enabling him to understand any simple messages the animals might be communicating (such as “danger is nearby, be alert” “you’re unfamiliar and strange,” or “do not come closer, we are guarding our den!”). Because of his innate understanding of the language of beasts, the character also counts as proficient for purposes of handling trained animals in their roles such as droving or shepherding. He gains +2 to all reaction rolls when encountering normal animals and can take animals as henchmen. He can train and handle animal henchmen to perform tricks or serve a particular role without having to separately possess Animal Training. This is effectively the Beast Friendship proficiency, selected as a custom power. If the character has this power and that proficiency, he can identify plants and fauna with a throw of 7+ and can take one more henchman than his Charisma would otherwise permit, as long as at least one is an animal. [Beastmaster, Chosen, Elven Ranger, Elven Wizard, Nobiran Wizard, Sylvan Witch, Wizard]

**Fungal Awareness:** The character gains the power to detect fungus, molds, slimes, and oozes within 60’. The character must concentrate for 1 turn (10 minutes) to activate the power. Once activated, the power lasts as long as the character maintains concentration. [Dwarven Sporecaster]

**Fungal Communion:** The character can commune directly with the omnipresent great fungi once per week. Fungal communion functions like the spell *contact other sphere.* [Dwarven Sporecaster]

**Fungal Friendship:** If the characters touches a fungus, mold, or ooze, he learns its species and type with a proficiency throw of 8+. Because he understands the subtle language by which the mycoflora whisper to each other, he gains +2 to all reaction rolls when encountering fungus, molds, and oozes. He can take fungus, molds, and oozes as henchmen (HD permitting) and give them simple instructions by concentrating at touch range. [Dwarven Sporecaster]

**Fungal Immunity:** From long exposure to the spores and toxins released by mycoflora, the character has become immune to the toxic effects of fungi and mold. He never suffers a delusionary or detrimental effect when imbibing a dwarven brew. He takes no damage or effects from any type of oozes (though his equipment is affected normally) and is immune to the deadly spores of molds. [Dwarven Sporecaster]

**Fungal Spawn (10th):** The character can share his mycological gifts with other creatures, welcoming them into the moist embrace of the mold. He can create fungal crossbreeds as if he were a mage of 11th level. All of the standard rules for crossbreeding creatures apply, except that one of the progenitor creatures must always be a fungus, mold, or ooze of some sort. Whatever he creates is automatically Friendly to him and can be recruited as a henchman (HD permitting). The character can crossbreed himself if desired.

**Gather Together the Darkness:** If the character has established a chaotic domain, then each month, his domain gains an extra 1d10 beastman families for every 1,000 beastmen in his realm, until its maximum population density is achieved. If he has established a chaotic realm, every chaotic domain in his realm gains additional beastmen at the same rate as well. [Zaharan Darklord]

**Gift of Tongues:**See **bonus languages**.

**Glamorous Aura:** The character is able to project a glamorous aura that awes, bedazzles and seduces those in his presence. He gains a +1 bonus to reaction rolls to impress and intimidate people he encounters. If this bonus results in a total of 12 or more, the subjects act as if *bewitched*while in his presence. This is effectively the Mystic Aura proficiency, selected as a custom power. For flavor, the elven spellsinger calls this power **irresistible voice**, the priestess of Nasga calls it **ravishing beauty**, and the warmistress calls its **alluring beauty** [Cultist of Lotan, Elven Cultist of Nasga, Elven Enchanter, Priestess of Nasga, Warmistress]

**Graceful Fighting:** See **blade-dancing**.

**Greater Rite of Sealing:** Once per week, the character can perform a rite that permanently seals a door, portal, or chest shut. It requires 1 round to perform the rite (like a spell). The character can freely open the sealed door without affecting it; otherwise, a door or object secured with the rite of sealing can be opened only by breaking in or with a successful *dispel magic*spell by a caster of greater level than the tombsealer. The tombsealer can maintain a number of sealed doors equal to his class level. Doors sealed with this rite remain sealed until *dispelled* or destroyed, persisting even if the tombsealer dies. The maximum number of sealed doors the character can maintain is permanently reduced by one each time he uses his greater rite of sealing. [Dwarven Tombsealer]

**Greatness of Soul:** See **battlefield prowess**.

**Grey Lore:** The character gains the ability to rebuke undead as a crusader of one half his class level. When the character casts spells that require a Death or Paralysis saving throw, the target suffers a -1 penalty and the character counts as one class level higher than his actual level of experience. His eligibility to research death and protection magic is determined as if he were one caster level higher than actual. He gains a +1 bonus on magic research throws and increases his research rate by 5% when researching death or protection magic.

**Grotesque Arts of Transformation (1st):** When the character casts transmogrification spells, the spell effects are calculated as if he were two class levels higher than his actual level of experience. His eligibility to create crossbreeds or research transmogrification magic is determined as if he were two caster levels higher than actual. Targets of his transmogrification spells suffer a -2 penalty to their saving throw. He gains a +2 bonus on magic research throws and increases his research rate by 10% when creating crossbreeds or researching transmogrification magic. Grotesque Arts can stack with the Transmogrification proficiency, such that the character’s transmogrification spells are calculated as if he were three (rather than two) caster levels higher and and his bonus to magic research and research rate is increased to +3 and 15%. [Warlock]

**Guardian Spirit:** The character is protected by an ancestor or nature spirit who favors him. The spirit is invisible but may materialize at will. It must stay within 30’ of the character at all times. The guardian spirit can move at a rate of 120', has AC 2, has one attack dealing 1d3 points of magic luminous damage, and can climb like a gecko. The spirit guardian is as intelligent as the character. It can understand the character’s speech, and the character can understand his guardian spirit’s speech, though no one else (except for others of his class) can do so without resorting to a *tongues* spell. So long as the character upholds his class’s requirements (usually a divine code), the guardian spirit will be utterly loyal to the character and will fight for him, perform services, and generally respond to any reasonable request. [Geckoman Spirit-Talker]

**Hard to Kill:** See **savage resilience**.

**Hardy People:** The character gains a +3 bonus on Blast saving throws and a +4 bonus on all other saving throws. *This custom power counts as 3 custom powers if selected.* [Dwarves]

**Harmony of Spirit:** See **divine blessing**.

**Healing Touch:**By touching a creature and spending a Fate Point, the character can instantly heal the creature by an amount equal to his Base Healing Rate or the creature’s Base Healing Rate, whichever is less. [Chosen]

**Hearty Constitution:** See **divine blessing**.

**Heroic Breakfast:** Once per day the character can recover his base healing rate in hp by consuming a meal accompanied by alcohol, coffee, or tea. This recovery is in addition to any hit points gained from complete rest. [Halflings]

**Heroic Spirit:** Because of the character’s courageous spirit, the maximum class level for the character’s class is increased by 1. *This custom power may only be selected by classes with a maximum class level of 13 or lower.* [Nobirans]

**Hideous Servant:** Experiments combining living creatures with the character’s own flesh and blood have created a hideous servantintimately bonded to his will. The character’ hideous servant is mechanically similar to a shaman’s totem animal. However, the character selects two of his hideous servant’s characteristics (AC, Movement, attack routine, and special abilities) from one animal and two characteristics from another, while the servant’s base Hit Dice are set to the average of the two animals selected. (Remember that actual HD will be adjusted by the character’s level.) The character does not gain a totem benefit. [Elven Wizard, Zaharan Sorcerer, Warlock]

**Holy Fervor:** Any hirelings of the same religion as the character gain a +1 bonus to their morale score whenever he is present. For flavor, anti-paladins call this **unholy fanaticism**. [Anti-Paladin, Flagellant, Lizardman Priestess, Paladin]

**Horrible Truths:** See **ancient pacts**.

**Impersonate Others:** This power has been removed from ***ACKS II****.* Replace it with one rank of Disguise proficiency. [Mountebank]

**Implacable Will:** This custom power extends the duration of a character’s domination of beastmen. Whenever the character succeeds in dominating beastmen (whether from a roll or automatically from an “A” result), the creatures are dominated for 1 day per level instead of the usual 1 turn per level. If the creatures would have been dominated for 1 day per level (from an “X” result), the creatures are instead controlled indefinitely. See also l**ordship over the undead** [Zaharan Darklord]

**Inexorable:** See **strength of spirit**.

**Infravision:** See **lightless vision.**

**Inhumanity:** The character suffers a penalty to the reactions, loyalty, and morale of humans and demi-humans. The character gets an equivalent bonus to the reactions, loyalty, and morale with a particular monster type. For flavor, bugmen call this **alien beings** and deep one hybrids call it **tainted blood**. Halflings call this power **child-like** and are actually rather offended to be included in this entry.*This custom power counts as 0 custom powers if selected.* [Bugmen, Deep Ones, Geckomen, Halflings, Thrassians]

**Initiative:** The character receives a +1 bonus to initiative rolls, including combat and spellcasting. For flavor, Geckomen call this power **lizard brain**. [Bladedancer, Geckomen]

**Innate Illusion Mastery:** When the character casts illusionspells (such as *phantasmal figment*), the spell effects are calculated as if he were two caster levels higher than his actual level of experience. Targets of his illusion spells suffer a -2 penalty to their saving throw. His eligibility to conduct research on illusion magic is determined as if he were two caster levels higher than actual. He gains a +2 bonus on magic research throws and increases his research rate by 10% when researching illusion magic. *This custom power counts as 1/2 custom power if selected*. [Gnomish Trickster]

**Innovative Researcher:** The character is capable of devising solutions that other spellcasters would never even conceive of. His insight advantage from using experimental methods is doubled from +2 to +4. [Wizard]

**Inspire Courage:** The character can improve the morale of troops. Inspiring courage requires a few moments of oration before a battle (one round), and makes up to 30 of the character’s allies within a 50' radius **inspired**. An inspired creature gains a +1 bonus to attack throws, armor class, morale rolls (for monsters or NPCs allied with the caster), and saving throws against magical **fear**. The bonus lasts for 10 minutes (1 turn). A character can inspire courage once per day per class level. (Even the most inspired epic gets stale if you hear it twice in the same day.) A character cannot inspire courage on characters who are already engaged in combat. For flavor, Thrassian deathchanters call this power **rouse to fury** and warlords call it **battle plan.** [Bard, Chosen, Dragon Incarnate, Dwarven Rhetor, Elven Courtier, Elven Cultist of Bel, Elven Warlord, Nobiran Champion, Nobiran Wizard, Thrassian Deathchanter, Warlord, Wizard]

**Inspire Dread:** The character can cause fear in its foes.Inspiring dread requires a few moments of oration (one round), and causes up to 30 of the character’s opponents within a 50' radius to become **shaken**. A shaken creature suffers a -1 penalty to attack throws, armor class, morale rolls (for monsters or NPCs allied with the caster), and saving throws against magical **fear**. The penalty lasts for 10 minutes (1 turn). The character can only attempt to inspire dread once per day per class level. Opponents receive a Paralysis saving throw to resist the effect. When used on the battlefield this ability can affect one enemy unit in an adjacent hex. [Elven Cultist of Dirgion, Zaharan Darklord, Zaharan Sorcerer]

**Inspire Exceptional Performance:** The character can inspire excellence in its allies. Inspiring exceptional performance requires a few moments of oration (one round) and grants up to 30 of the character’s allies within a 50’ radius a +1 bonus to initiative rolls, attack throws, and proficiency throws for 10 minutes (1 turn). The character can inspire exceptional performance once per day per class level. [Terran Starman]

**Inspire Hope:** Inspiring hope requires a few moments of oration (one round), and grants allied creatures within 30’ a pool of temporary hit points(see ***ACKS II RR*** p. XX). These temporary hit points last for one turn (10 minutes) or until lost to damage, whichever comes first. A character can inspire hope once per day when he gains this power, and one additional time per day with each level thereafter. Ecclesiastics call this power **rally the faithful**. *This custom power counts as 2 powers if selected*. [Bard, Ecclesiastic]

**Instill Strength:** Instilling strength is only open to characters who can dominate beastmen or control undead. It requires a few moments of oration (one round), and grants dominated beastmen or controlled undead within 30’ a pool of temporary hit pointsequal to the lower of the character’s or the creature’s base healing rate. These temporary hit points last for one turn (10 minutes) or until lost to damage, whichever comes first. The character can instill strength once per day per level. (When used on the battlefield this ability can affect one friendly unit in the character’s hex.) [Zaharan Darklord]

**Instinctive Dodge:** The character can dodge blows in combat with inhuman speed, provided it is not encumbered. When the character is wearing light, very light, or no armor and has an encumbrance of 5 stone or less, he has an unarmored AC of 2 at 1st level. At 7th level, his unarmored AC increases to 4, and at 10th level it increases to 5. This custom power cannot be stacked with **blade-dancing** or Swashbuckling. *This custom power counts as 2 powers if selected.* [Bugman Praetor]

**Invulnerable:**The character is blessed with partial invulnerability to harm. Any ordinary damage the character suffers is reduced by 1 point per die. The damage reduction is applied per die. Damage can be reduced to 0, but not less than 0, on each die. This custom power can be selected up to three times. Each additional time the custom power is selected, damage suffered is reduced by 1 additional point per die, to a maximum of 3 points per die. [Chosen]

**Iron Leadership:** See **lion-hearted leader**.

**Irresistible Voice:** See **glamorous aura**.

**Jumping:** The character can leap up to 30’ in a round as a movement action. It can jump in any direction, including straight up, and can leap over obstacles or combatants up to 30’ high between it and its landing point. This movement is not constrained by being engaged. *This custom power counts as 4 powers if selected.* [Bugman Praetor]

**Keen Eyes:** This power, which offered a partial version of a thief’s searching abilities, has been removed from ***ACKS II****.* In lieu of this power, the elven power **attunement to nature** has been made more powerful. [Chosen, Elven Courtier, Elven Enchanter, Elven Nightblade, Elven Ranger, Elven Spellsword]

**Keen Insect Senses:** See **Alertness**.

**Killing Spree:** See **berserkergang, lesser**.

**Kinship with Arthropods and Fungi:** The character can identify arthropods and fungi with a proficiency throw of 11+, and understands the subtle body language and moods of arthropods and fungal creatures (though they may not understand the character) automatically. This grants them a +2 to all reaction rolls when encountering normal and giant arthropods and fungal creatures, and allows them to take giant arthropods and fungal creatures as henchmen. See also **friend of birds and beasts**. [Bugman Ovate]

**Kiss of Life**: The character’s lungs become home to colonies of a highly active strain of necrofungus. While the character can still create spore zombies as normal, he may instead breath into the mouth of a mostly intact corpse to animate it as a spore zombie in a single round. Spore zombies created this way are rapidly consumed by the variant fungus and become mushy pulp in only an hour, though they remain animated until destroyed if sprinkled with clubhead mushroom brew. The character must have **necrosporing** custom power to select this power. [Dwarven Sporecaster]

**Laugh at Pain:** The character ignores any penalty from Permanent Wounds 21-25/1 or 26+/1 (wounds that ache). If subjected to a *circle of agony* or *iron maiden* spell, the character is healed instead of damaged by the effect. If the character sees a *symbol of pain*, he regains all lost hp instantly. [Priestess of Nasga]

**Lay on Hands:** The character can heal himself or another by laying on hands once per day. The character can restore 2 hit points per experience level. This is effectively the Laying on Hands proficiency, selected as a custom power, and the character can select the Laying on Hands proficiency to gain additional uses of the power per day. For flavor, dwarven furnacewives call this power **fiery cauterization**. [Nobiran Wonderworker, Paladin]

**Legwork:** See **blade-dancing**.

**Lightless Vision:** The character has lightless vision at the stated range. *30’ lightless vision counts as 1 1/2 custom power. 45’ lightless vision counts as 2 custom powers. 60’ lightless vision counts as 2 1/2 custom powers. 90’ lightless vision counts as 3 custom powers.* [Thrassians]

**Lion-Hearted Leader:** If the character is fighting on the battlefield with an army, the army automatically stands firm on its first morale roll, or rallies if it would have stood firm. This benefit is lost for the duration of the battle, however, if the character himself routs, flees, or leads from the rear. For flavor, the warlord calls this **iron leadership**.[Chosen, Elven Warlord, Nobiran Champion, Warlord]

**Lizard Brain:** See **initiative**.

**Loadbearing:** The character reduces his effective encumbrance by 2 stone for purposes of determining his speed. [Dwarven Excavator, Nobiran Champion]

**Longeval:** The character becomes ageless and enjoys a lifespan three times longer than normal. He becomes immune to diseases caused by undead and gains a +1 bonus to his HD roll at 1st level. This is effectively the Elven Bloodline proficiency, selected as a custom power. For flavor, chosen call this power **mystical bloodline**,mystics call this power **perfection of body**, and priestesses of Nasga call it **artificial youth**.[Bugman Ovate, Chosen, Deep One Hybrid, Dragon Incarnate, Mystic, Nobiran, Priestess of Nasga]

**Lordship Over the Undead:** This custom power extends the duration of a character’s control of undead. Whenever the character succeeds in controlling undead (whether from a roll or automatically from a “T” result), the creatures are controlled for 1 day per level instead of the usual 1 turn per level. If the creatures would have been controlled for 1 day per level (from a “D” result), the creatures are instead controlled indefinitely. See also **implacable will**. [Elven Cultist of Dirgion, Elven Wizard, Warlock, Zaharan Sorcerer]

**Loremastery:** At 1st level, the character can make a proficiency throw of 18+ to decipher occult runes, remember ancient history, or identify a historic artifact or special monster part. The proficiency throw required reduces by 1 per level. The character can identify magic items as if he were a 5th level mage. If the character can already identify magic items, he can do so with a +2 bonus to his magic research throw and +10% bonus to his research rate. This is effectively the Loremastery proficiency, selected as a custom power. [Bard, Cultist of Nabu, Dwarven Rhetor, Loremaster]

**Lore of Stars and Spheres:** The character is able to learn and cast ritual magic at half the usual material cost and research cost. [Nobiran Wizard, Wizard]

**Low-Light Vision:** The character can see twice as far as normal in dim light. The character can read a scroll with even the tiniest candle flame.

**Lucky:** When re-rolling attack throws, proficiency throws, or saving throws using Fate Points, the character can roll the die twice and choose the better value. [Chosen]

**Magic Hands:** The character’s hands are a force of supernature. He can deal extraordinary damage with his fists. [Dwarven Pugilist]

**Magic Mirror:** By directing his gaze onto a mirror, crystal, reflective pool, or other surface upon which the images can be displayed, the character can see visions of faraway people and places. He can cast *scry* (as the spell) once per day. Each use takes 1 turn (10 minutes). If the character has *clairaudience*or *telepathy*in his repertoire, he can cast either spell at the same time in order to use one of those spells while scrying. [Antiquarian Witch]

**Magical Proficiency:**The character can select one class proficiency, choosing from Alchemy, Arcane Dabbling, Battle Magic, Collegiate Wizardry, Elementalism, Loremastery, Magical Engineering, Prestidigitation, Quiet Magic, Sensing Power, Soothsaying, Transmogrification, or Unflappable Casting. This custom power can be selected multiple times, selecting an additional proficiency each time, to a maximum limit of three selections. Note that some proficiencies available with this custom power are not useful unless the character has selected the Eldritch Talent custom power or can cast spells. [Chosen].

**Majesty of the Dragon:** See **command of voice**.

**Malevolent Reputation:** This power makes it easier to recruit large hosts of minions when dominating beastmen or controlling undead (chosen when the power is selected). Whenever the character succeeds in dominating beastmen with an “A” result, or controlling undead with a “T” result, 3d6 Hit Dice worth of creatures are dominated. With an “X” or “D” result, 4d6 Hit Dice worth of creatures are dominated. [Zaharan Darklord]

**Mapper:** The character can understand and make maps. With a proficiency throw of 11+, the character can interpret or draft complicated layouts or map an area by memory. This is effectively the Mapping proficiency selected as a custom power. [Dwarven Delver]

**Martial Proficiency:**The character can select one class proficiency, choosing from Alertness, Blind Fighting, Combat Reflexes, Combat Trickery, Fighting Style, Precise Shooting, Skirmishing, Swashbuckling, Weapon Finesse, and Weapon Focus. This custom power can be selected multiple times, selecting an additional proficiency each time, to a maximum limit of three selections. [Chosen]

**Martial Talent:**The character has a native aptitude for weapons. The character gains a +1 bonus to attack throws with his choice of either melee or missile attacks. This custom power can be selected twice, once for melee and once for missile attacks. For flavor, elven courtiers call this power **classical weapons training**. [Chosen, Elven Courtier]

**Martyrdom:** Upon reaching 0 hit points, the character can choose to remain in full fighting condition, functioning as if he has above-zero hit points, and applying any further damage as negative hit points. He can continue fighting until he reaches a negative number of hit points equal or exceeding his Constitution score or until he stays conscious for a number of rounds equal to his level of experience. As soon as one of these conditions occurs, the character becomes incapacitated. The price of using martyrdom is that the character he suffers a penalty of -1 per level of experience to both Mortal Wounds and Tampering with Mortality rolls related to that injury. [Flagellant]

**Marvelous Machines:** The character is capable of creating marvelous machines that blend science and magic. The wizard is able to design and build constructs at half the usual material cost and research cost for his class. [Elven Wizard, Nobiran Wizard]

**Mastery of Enchantments and Illusions:** When the character casts enchantment spells (such as*bewitch person*) or illusionspells (such as *phantasmal figment*), the spell effects are calculated as if he were two caster levels higher than his actual level of experience. Targets of his enchantment and illusion spells suffer a -2 penalty to their saving throw. His eligibility to conduct research on enchantment and illusion magic is determined as if he were two caster levels higher than actual. He gains a +2 bonus on magic research throws and increases his research rate by 10% when researching enchantment or illusion magic.. If the character has this custom power and the proficiency of the same name, the character can cast enchantments and illusions as if he were three (rather than two) caster levels higher than his actual caster level, and targets suffer a -3 penalty to their saving throws. For flavor, Zaharan sorcerers call this power **mastery of domination and deception**. [Cultist of Lotan, Elven Cultist of Nasga, Elven Enchanter, Nobiran Veildancer, Zaharan Sorcerer]

**Mastery of Domination and Deception:** See **mastery of charms and illusions**.

**Meditative Focus:** The character can become **focused** once per day per level of experience. While **focused,** the character gains a +1 bonus to all attack throws, proficiency throws, saving throws, and initiative rolls. A meditative focus lasts for 1 turn (10 minutes). [Chosen, Mystic, Nobiran Veildancer]

**Mercantile Network**: Whenever venturersbuy and sell equipment, hire retainers, and/or engage in mercantile ventures in a market they have previously entered, they can treat the market as if it were one market class larger than its actual size (Class I markets remain Class I markets) or they can take a +1 bonus to market impact, whichever is more useful. [Bugmen Dredger, Cultist of Moloch, Venturer]

**Mindfulness:** See **alertness**, above.

**Military Genius:**The character commands the battlefield like a god of war. He gains a permanent +1 bonus to his strategic ability, leadership ability, and morale modifier when commanding troops on the battlefield. [Chosen]

**Mitigate Damage**: The character can reduce damage by absorbing the blow on his armor or shield. When the character mitigates damage, the damage dealt by the attack is reduced to 1 point. The excess damage is absorbed by the character’s armor or shield, which is reduced in effectiveness (AC) by 1 point per 10 points of damage mitigated (rounded up). In addition, if the amount of damage mitigated is greater than the character’s current hit points, then he is also knocked **prone.** The character cannot mitigate damage if he is backstabbed, choking/vomiting, cowering, faltering, frightened, grabbed, helpless, incapacitated, infuriated, mad, mesmerized, paralyzed, petrified, prone, slumbering, surprised, unconscious, or wrestled. Special maneuvers cannot be mitigated, nor can damage from critical hits, magic, or area of effect attacks. Armor and/or shields that are reduced to 0 or less effectiveness are ruined and cannot be repaired. Otherwise an armorer with a workshop can repair the damage to the character’s armor and shield at a cost of 10gp per point of effectiveness. [Nobiran Champion]

**Modern Thought:** The character believes in causal determinism, materialism, and empiricism. He gains a +3 bonus on saving throws against enchantments and illusions. [Terrans]

**Monopoly Power:** If the character has established a guildhouse in a settlement, he canuse it to seize monopoly power in the settlement. Thereafter, he earns 1gp per month in monopoly revenue per urban family in the urban settlement. He does not need to be the domain’s ruler to earn this revenue; if he is the domain’s ruler, the monopoly revenue is in addition to his domain revenue. Only one venturer in each urban settlement can earn monopoly revenue from each urban family. If there is more than one venturer with this class power operating in the settlement, then either the character must eliminate his rival(s) or he must come to a deal to distribute the monopoly revenue between the various venturers. [Venturer].

**Mushroom Management:** The character learns how to apply his mycocultural knowledge at large scale. Each month in which the character is on hand to personally manage dwarven mushroom farms, the domain’s piltgarin families generate an additional 1gp of land revenue each. Personally managing mushroom farms requires 20 days of major activity. The character must either be the domain ruler or have the permission of the domain ruler to supervise the mushroom farms. [Dwarven Sporecaster]

**Mushroom Overlord:** The character can manipulate the varietals of mushrooms in a non-dwarven domain to make them farmable by other sapient races. The character must either be the domain ruler or have the permission of the domain ruler and must personally supervise the mushroom farms. He can organize work-gangs of any sapient race to work mushroom farms that he personally oversees. Every family or every 5 conscripts or slaves yields one work-gang. Each work-gang functions like a piltgarin family for purposes of mushroom farming. If a domain’s population consists of 25% or more involuntary work gangs, its base morale score is decreased by 1. While a domain’s population consists of 50% or more involuntary work gangs, its base morale score is decreased by 2. While a domain is 100% involuntary work gangs, its domain morale is decreased by 4. If at any time the domain’s current morale score becomes -2 (Turbulent) or worse, some or all of the work gangs will rise up in revolt, becoming rebels. Fortunately (for the ruler, anyway), it’s much easier to suppress a rebellion by workers laboring in confined mushroom farms than it is to stop peasant uprisings across the countryside. If the ruler has a garrison worth at least 2gp per work gang present in the domain, then one-half the rebels are automatically slain and the remainder return to work the following month. [Dwarven Sporecaster]

**Mystical Bloodline:** See **longeval**.

**Multilingual:** See **bonus languages**.

**Natural Stealth:** Opponents suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls when encountering the character approaching from outside line of sight or lying in wait in cover or darkness. [Barbarian, Beastmaster, Explorer]

**Oneness of Land and Lord:** The character’s hit points are increased by 2 x the current morale score of his domain (a negative morale score will decrease his hp). Provided the character remains Lawful, healthy, and free of corrupting weaknesses, his domain’s Land Value is increased by 2gp, as if it were benefitting from a Harvest ritual. If the character is Neutral, but otherwise healthy and uncorrupted, there is no effect. If the character is suffering from a curse, disease, or corrupting weakness, then his domain’s Land Value is decreased by 2gp, as if it were suffering from a Ravage ritual. This custom power has no effect if the character is not the ruler of a domain. [Nobiran Champion]

**Pathfinding:** When the character guides a party in familiar territory, the party gains a +4 bonus on proficiency throws to avoid getting lost. At 1st level, a character is considered familiar with the civilized areas of his starting region as well as all territory within one 24-mile hex radius of civilized areas. With each additional level of experience, the radius increases one 24-mile hex further from civilization. Pathfinding stacks with Navigation proficiency. Beastmasters and lizardman hunters call this power **avoid getting lost**. [Beastmaster, Explorer, Lizardman Hunter, Venturer]

**Perceive Intentions:** The character always know the exact reaction result (Hostile, Unfriendly, etc.) of creatures he interacts with, even if the creatures attempt to lie or conceal their reactions. Creatures with a CHA greater than the character’s WIL are immune to this power (and the character will know they are immune). [Mystic, Nephilim]

**Perfection of Body:** See **longeval**.

**Personal Talisman:** The character has a personal talisman that provides a +1 bonus to ceremony throws for ceremonies of one particular type. (The character can choose from death & necromancy; detection; elemental air; elemental earth; elemental fire; elemental water; enchantment & illusion; healing; movement; protection; summoning; and transmogrification). [Dwarven Furnacewife, Loremaster, Occultist]

**Placate:** The character can placate his opponents use disarming words, glib talk, or submissive body language, until help arrives. The character cannot attack while placating, but can move at 1/2 speed or can perform an action in lieu of moving, such as standing up from being knocked down, picking an item off the ground, or retrieving an item from a pack or sack. The character cannot placate if he, or any other members of his race with this power in his party, have already attacked an opponent during the present encounter. When a character is placating, any opponent attempting to strike or otherwise directly attack him must make a Spells saving throw. If the save succeeds, the opponent can attack the character normally that round. If the save fails, the opponent will not attack the character that round and will attack another creature instead. Area effects may still affect the character. Mindless creatures and fantastic creatures of animal intelligence cannot be placated, but ordinary animals and all sapient creatures are susceptible to the character’s cringing placation. [Halfling Bounder, Halfling Burglar]

**Power of Sacrifice:** The character can gain either arcane or divine power by blood sacrifice, and counts any power gained from blood sacrifice as double its gp value. He can store the arcane power from blood sacrifices indefinitely, even when not actively performing magical research.. [Warlock, Zaharan Sorcerer]

**Precise Shot:** The character can make a missile attack against an unengaged enemy target without penalty. The character can attack an engaged enemy target at a -4 penalty and ignore up to 4 points of cover. This is effectively the Precise Shooting proficiency, selected as a custom power, and the character may take ranks in the Precise Shooting proficiency to reduce this penalty to -2 or less. [Elven Ranger]

**Prestidigitation:** The character can magically accomplish simple illusions and sleight of hand tricks suitable for impressing peasants, such as lighting a candle or shuffling cards, at will. The character must be able to perform the task physically, and be free to speak and gesture. He can use magical sleight-of-hand to pick pockets as a thief of one half his class level. This is effectively the Prestidigitation proficiency, selected as a custom power. [Elven Enchanter, Gnomish Trickster]

**Probability Trance:** The character can cast *divination* once per day. [Mystic]

**Profane Endurance:** See **flesh-runes**.

**Provoke the Passion:** Through teasing, taunting, and flirting the character can use her alluring beauty to provoke the passions ofanintelligent creature that is potentially attracted to her. Provoking the passions of a creature is a full round action, during which the character must remain stationary and take no other action. A creature must be within 30’ of the character and able to both see and hear her in order to be the target of provocation. The targeted creature must make a Spells saving throw. You might grant bonuses or penalties to the saving throw depending on circumstances, the temperament of the creature, and its training or familiarity with the character. If the save succeeds, the creature is not provoked. If the save fails, the creature is provoked for 1d4 rounds plus 1 round per level of the character. The effect of provocation depends on the creature’s current reaction to the character. A hostile creature will become enraged, attacking the characters in preference to all others without regard for its own safety for the duration of the provocation. An unfriendly creature will become hostile, seeking to verbally or physically harass the character for the duration. A neutral creature will become distracted, ignoring other duties or activities to pay attention to the character for the duration. An indifferent creature will become friendly, seeking to assist the character for the duration. A friendly creature will become enamored, helping the character as if *bewitched*for the duration of the provocation. If the character or one of her allies attacks a creature while it is provoked, it immediately becomes enraged. [Elven Cultist of Nasga, Priestess of Nasga, Warmistress]

**Public Education:** The character’s domain gains a 1gp increase in its service revenue due to the character’s mastery of the useful arts and crafts. However, the domain ruler is expected to spend this additional revenue on agricultural improvement, urban improvement, or warfare to defend the domain against invaders or chaotic realms. A domain ruler using the funds for any other purpose reduces his domain’s base morale score by 1. [Katripol]

**Public Flagellation:** The character inspires conviction in his comrades. Public flagellation requires a few moments (one round), during which time the character deals 2 hp of damage per level to himself. All allies within 30’ of the character then gain temporary hit points equal to the lower of the character's or the ally's number of Hit Dice. These temporary hit points last for one turn (10 minutes) or until lost to damage, whichever comes first. To benefit from this ability, the subjects be of the same alignment and religion of the character. Each time this power is used, the character acquires a minor scar (as per the Permanent Wounds table). [Flagellant]

**Pugilism:** The character is an expert in striking with his fists. He can make two attacks per round with his bare hands. The barehanded blows deal 1d3 damage or more each (modified by STR as usual). He can deal nonlethal damage or lethal damage as desired. He can punch characters in metal armor without himself taking damage. He can use the Weapon Finesse proficiency with his fists. *This custom power counts as 3 or more customer powers if selected, depending on the damage of the fists. Each additional custom power can increase the damage by one die.* [Dwarven Pugilist]

**Purity of Body and Soul:** See **divine health**.

**Pyroclastics:** The character is an expert in safely using explosives and incendiaries in dangerous subterranean environments to collapse tunnels, demolish rock, and shatter stone. He attacks as a fighter of his class level when hurling burning oil or petards. Anytime he fumbles with burning oils or petards, he can avoid setting himself aflame or detonating the petard with a successful Paralysis saving throw. Finally, he deals +1 damage at 1st level with burning oil or petards, and deals an additional +1 at 3rd, 6th, and 9th level. This bonus applies to both direct and splash damage but not to ongoing damage. If he has the Ambushing proficiency, he can ambush with oil to deal additional damage on a direct hit. He may cleave with oil provided he has lit flasks at hand. [Dwarven Excavator]

**Quickening:** See **animal reflexes**.

**Rally the Faithful:** See **inspire hope**.

**Ravishing Beauty:** See **glamorous aura**.

**Read Languages:** See **deciphering.**

**Relentless:** See **connection to nature**.

**Rhetoric:** The character’s speeches can be used to cast certain rhetorical effects (spells) on his listeners, as a dwarven rhetor. [Dwarven Rhetor]

**Right Stuff:** Anytime the character is reduced to one-half his maximum hit points or less during an encounter, the character immediately gains a +1 bonus to armor class, attack throws, proficiency throws, saving throws, and initiative rolls. The bonus lasts until the end of the encounter for one turn (10 minutes) or until he is healed, whichever comes first. [Terran Cosmonaut]

**Rouse to Fury:** See **inspire courage**.

**Rotless Rot:** The character with this power does not suffer from age-related penalties to his ability scores. Anytime he fails a saving throw vs Death due to advancing age, instead of dying he gains a Mutation of the Flesh from the Gifts of the Great Fungi table in ***By This Axe****.* [Dwarven Sporecaster]

**Rumormongering:** The character can automatically learn 1d4 interesting rumors from old contacts and commercial associates any time he re-visits an urban settlement he has previously done business in. Rumormongering requires one day of major activity (6 hours) in an urban settlement. A character can rumormonger in any given urban settlement only once per month.

**Sanctified Body:** See **divine health**.

**Savage Resilience:** When the character is required to consult the Mortal Woundstable, the player may roll twice and choose the preferred result to apply. The character also subtracts his class level from the number of days of bed rest required to recover. For flavor, bugmen, chosen, and dwarven pugilists call this power **hard to kill**, while dragons incarnate call it **dragon’s resilience**, and elven cultists call it **supernatural resilience**.[Barbarian, Beastmaster, Bugmen, Chosen, Dwarven Fury, Dwarven Pugilist, Elven Cultist of Bel]

**Scaly Hide:** The character has a scaly hide which increases his unarmored AC to 1 or more. A heavy scaly hide might reduce the character’s base movement rate.

| 4 powers | 4 | -60’ |

**Scientific Mindset:** The character can use alien technology as if he were an arcane spellcaster. [Terrans]

**Scion of Kings:** See **blood of kings**.

**Second Sight:** The character has a connection to the hidden world, and can see innately or magically invisible creatures within 60’. Invisible creatures are aware that the character can see them, and might take a particular interest in him as a result. Second Sight does not provide the ability to see creatures or features hidden through cover or darkness. [Antiquarian Witch, Chosen]

**Secret Knowledge:** See **forbidden spells**.

**Secretion:** The character gains the ability to exude a particular type of secretion by touching a creature. When this power is selected, the character learns how to exude one secretion, based on any dwarven brew recipe known to him. The effect of the secretion on the creature touched is identical to the effect of drinking the dwarven brew. Exuding a secretion follows the rules for casting a spell. The character must declare the attempt before rolling initiative, must remain stationary, and must not take damage before his initiative count arrives. The character must make an attack throw to touch a creature that does not wish to be touched. Secretion can be selected as a power multiple times in order to be able to exude different secretions. [Dwarven Sporecaster]

**Secrets of the Dark Arts:** He can control undead as a Chaotic crusader of one half his class level. If the character casts death spells, his targets suffer a -2 penalty on their saving throws. When the character casts necromantic spells (such as **animate undead**), the spell effects are calculated as if he were two class levels higher than his actual level of experience. His eligibility to research death or necromancy magic is determined as if he were two caster levels higher than actual. He gains a +2 bonus on magic research throws and increases his research rate by 10% when researching death or necromancy magic. While this is effectively Black Lore of Zahar proficiency selected as a custom power, consider Secrets of the Dark Acts as a separate custom power and allow it to stack with the proficiency, such that the character can control undead as a crusader of two-thirds his class level (rounded up), and his death and necromancy spells and research are calculated as if he were three (rather than two) caster levels higher than his actual caster level. [Elven Wizard, Occultist, Lizardman Witch-Doctor, Necromancer, Warlock, Zaharan Sorcerer]

**Secrets of Life and Death:** The character can perform necromancy at half the usual material cost and research cost. [Elven Wizard, Warlock, Zaharan Sorcerer]

**Sensitivity to Rock and Stone:** The character gains a +1 bonus to surprise rolls when underground.

If separately proficient in Listening, they gain a +2 bonus to their throw instead. *This power counts as 1 1/2 class powers if selected.* [Dwarves]

**Shapechange:** The character can shapechange into one specific type of normal animal once per day per level of experience. While in animal form, the character has the movement, armor class, attacks, damage, and special abilities of the animal. He retains his normal Hit Dice, hit points, attack throws, and saving throws. If the character is of greater Hit Dice than his animal type, he will appear as a bigger, stronger version of the animal, to a maximum of twice normal size. For example, a 10th level character in lion shape would appear as a huge predator, twice the mass of a normal lion. Apart from size, the shaman is indistinguishable from a normal animal. The totem animal shape does not detect as magical, is not detected by spells that reveal illusions, and cannot be **dispelled**. Changing shape can be performed during combat as an action in lieu of an attack. [Berserker, Shaman]

**Shape Flesh and Bone:** The character is able to create magical crossbreeds at half the usual material cost and research cost. [Elven Wizard, Warlock, Zaharan Sorcerer]

**Speak with Animals:** The character can *speak with beasts* (as the spell) at will. [Cultist of Qetesh, Gnomes]

**Speak with Arthropods:** The character can *speak with arthropods*at will. Treat this effect as *speak with beasts*but the power works with vermin instead of beasts. [Bugman Ovate]

**Speed of Thought:** See **animal reflexes**.

**Spell Storing:** When the character casts a spell that would normally target a creature, he can instead cast it into his melee weapon, where it remains stored until discharged. The effect will discharge onto the next creature the character strikes with the weapon, resulting in both melee damage and the normal effects of the spell. The character can only store one spell at a time, and the spell will discharge harmlessly if not used in 1 turn, if the weapon is sundered, or if the character loses his grip on the weapon. *This custom power counts as 1 power with Arcane Value 1-2 and 2 powers with Arcane Value 3-4.* [Zaharan Ruinguard]

**Spiritwalk:** The character can spiritwalk, following the procedures detailed in the shaman class. After 1 turn (10 minutes) of chanting, the character enters a deep trance during which his spirit walks free of his body. If the spiritwalking character can assume multiple forms, the spirit can assume any of those forms as desired. The effects are otherwise identical to the 5th level spell *spiritwalk.* Spiritwalking is so taxing that it can be performed but once per week. [Berserker, Geckoman Spirit-talker, Shaman]

**Spore Calibration:** The character’s communion with his spore zombies is so total that they become capable of more complex activities. The spore zombies can be assigned to work on piltgarin farms or on mines, with five spore zombies equaling one dwarven family. The spore zombies never rebel and are unaffected by domain morale. The character must have **necrosporing** custom power to select this power. [Dwarven Sporecaster]

**Spore Fermentation:** The character can cause a spore zombie’s innards to rapidly ferment, bloating with gasses that create a destructive blast when released. Preparing an explosive spore zombie takes 1 turn (10 minutes) but can be done simultaneously with that spore zombie’s creation. Whenever an explosive spore zombie is destroyed, the eruption of gas deals 2d6 points of damage to everything within a 10’ radius, with a saving throw versus Blast for half damage. The character can command an explosive spore zombie to destroy itself in lieu of it attacking. Even if sprinkled with clubfoot brew, an explosive spore zombie lasts only one day before exploding on its own, its body no longer able to contain the gasses. The character must have **necrosporing** custom power to select this power. [Dwarven Sporecaster]

**Spore Perception:** By concentrating, the character can access the visual, auditory, and tactile senses of one spore zombie or sporecalled henchman within range of his communication spores, subject to the normal limitations of high winds. The character must have **necrosporing** custom power to select this power. [Dwarven Sporecaster]

**Spore Synchronization:** Spore zombies created by a character with this power act on their master’s initiative in combat when within control range, rather than attacking last each round. The character must have **necrosporing** custom power to select this power. [Dwarven Sporecaster]

**Stalwart Soul:** The character’s soul is pure as gold and hard as steel. He is immune to enervation, mummy rot, and aging effects caused by undead. Even if slain by infectious undead he never rises in undeath, and his remains cannot be made into undead by necromantic magic of any sort. [Dwarven Tombsealer]

**Steady Trade Route:** The character can establish a steady trade route for transactions in any two types of merchandise between any two of the markets that he has visited. The trade route’s markets, and the specific type of merchandise that is bought and sold at each market, is chosen by the character when he establishes the trade route. Thereafter, anytime the venturer personally enters one of the trade route’s markets, he can add one-half his class level to his market impact when assessing determining the amount of merchandise of that type available for purchase or sale. If that results in his market impact exceeding the market maximum, he can advance to the next highest market class. The transactions occur at the prevailing market price in the markets, so it behooves the character to select two markets with different Demand Modifiers so he can arbitrage prices. [Venturer II]

**Strength of Spirit:** The character is immune to all natural and magical fear effects. For flavor, Chosen call this power **courage**, Terran cosmonauts call it **daredevil**, and elven cultists and Zaharan ruinguards call it **inexorable**. [Chosen, Dragon Incarnate, Elven Cultist of Dirgion, Mystic, Nobiran Veil Dancer, Terran Cosmonaut, Zaharans]

**Steward of the Wild:** See **animal friendship**.

**Subtle Beguilement:** When casting enchantment spells, the character counts as having the Quiet Magic proficiency. If he already has Quiet Magic proficiency, he can cast enchantment spells using subvocalized words and no hand gestures. In either case, targets of his enchantment spells suffer a -2 penalty to their saving throw, or a -3 penalty if he also has Mastery of Enchantment & Illusions proficiency. [Chthonic Witch]

**Summon Infernal Powers:** The character can cast *summon invisible stalker*once per month. It takes 1 turn (10 minutes) to cast. [Occultist, Sorcerer]

**Supernatural Resilience:** See **savage resilience**.

**Survivability of Cockroaches:** The character is **immune** to all forms of disease, including magical diseases such as those caused by spells, mummies, or lycanthropes.The character is also **immune** to mundane poisonous damage and automatically succeeds on saving throws against poisons with effects other than immediate death. He is **resistant** to extraordinary poisonous damage and gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against poisons with the effect of immediate death. *This custom power counts as 2 powers, because it combines Divine Health and Wholeness of Body.* [Bugmen]

**Swimming:** The character gains a swimming movement rate and can hold his breath for an extended period of time. Note that this class power differs from the Swimming proficiency. *This custom power counts as 2 or more custom powers if selected, depending on the ability gained.* [Cultist of Rahab, Deep One Hybrid, Thrassians]

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Cost** | **Swim Rate** | **Hold Breath Duration (Rounds)** |
| 2 power | 60’ | 10 + CON modifier |
| 2 1/2 powers | 90’ | 30 + 3 x CON modifier |
| 3 powers | 120’ | 60 + 6 x CON modifier |

**Sworn Foe:** When this custom power is selected, the character must designate one specific individual monster or NPC by its name or unique physical characteristic (e.g. “the six-fingered man”). That creature becomes his sworn foe. The character gains a +2 bonus to attack throws and saving throws when confronting his sworn foe. If the character lands a successful attack on his sworn foe (including spells), the character can spend a Fate Point to deal double damage dice from the attack. If the sworn foe lands a successful attack on the character, the character can spend a Fate Point to halve the damage dealt by the attack. Once a character defeats his sworn foe, he can name a new sworn foe at any time thereafter. A sworn foe must have at least equal HD or levels of experience than the character; if the character ever surpasses his sworn foe in level or HD, he must select a new foe. [Chosen]

**Tainted Blood:** See **inhumanity**.

**Taunt:** The character can taunt an intelligent creature (through word, gesture, or other action in lieu of attacking) in order to goad them into heedlessly berating or attacking the character in preference to all else. The taunted creature must be within 30’, be able to see or hear the character, and must succeed at a Spells saving throw with rage for 1d4 rounds plus 1 round per level of the character. In combat environments, hostile creatures who have been successfully taunted will heedlessly attack the character in preference to all others for the duration with disregard for their own safety, while in more social situations (such as at court), the creature’s reaction immediately turns unfriendly or hostile (if already unfriendly) and the creature will become verbally or possibly physically abusive to the character should the chance present itself. You might grant bonuses or penalties to the saving throw depending on circumstances, the temperament or natural inclinations of the creature, and/or their training (such as a diplomat in court possessing ranks in Diplomacy). The character can taunt a creature no more than once per hour. [Fool]

**Technological Jargon:** Technological jargon can be used to communicate with any other characters educated in the workings of technology, even if they do not share any common languages. A character can use technological jargon to communicate without error with any character who possesses the ability to perform ceremonies in the engineering tradition, or who possesses the ability to design, build, and repair automatons, or who possesses the ability to design and create constructs. Characters with Alien Lore, Engineering or Loremastery proficiencies may understand the character’s technological jargon with a successful proficiency throw. [Terran Engineer]

**Thievery Proficiency:**The character can select one class proficiency, choosing from Acrobatics, Alertness, Ambushing, Cat Burglary, Climbing, Contortionism, Eavesdropping, Lip Reading, Lockpicking, Passing Without Trace, Running, Skulking, and Trap Finding. This custom power can be selected multiple times, selecting an additional proficiency each time, to a maximum limit of three selections. [Chosen]

**Torment the Mind:** Once per day, the character can cast *dark whisper* with a casting time of 1 round. Creatures *bewitched* with other special abilities suffer a -4 penalty on saving throws against this effect. [Priestess of Nasga]

**Totem Animal:** The character can acquire a totem animal, following the procedures detailed in the shaman class. This power is a greatly modified version of the Familiar proficiency. Wizards call this **animal companion**. [Elven Wizard, Nobiran Wizard, Shaman, Wizard]

**Totem Benefit**: The character chooses a totem animal and receives a bonus proficiency related to the totem. The available animals and proficiencies received vary by class. For example, a lizardman cobra-warrior receives the Combat Reflexes proficiency for free. [Berserker, Lizardman Warrior, Shaman]

**Traditional Medicine):** The character can identify and forage for healing herbs as if he had one rank of Naturalism proficiency. (If he already has Naturalism, he gains a +4 bonus on proficiency throws to identify and forage for healing herbs.) He can use healing herbs as if he had Healing proficiency. Given one turn (10 minutes), he can combine a pound of healing herbs with an equal gp of special components to create potent healing herbs that increase their effect by +1. The character needs a cauldron over a fire or a kitchen to make potent healing herbs. The potent herbs lose all efficacy after 24 hours. [Antiquarian Witch]

**Treachery:** Anytime the character uses Diplomacy or Bribery to gain a Friendly reaction roll, he can force every creature (allied or enemy) within 30’ to make surprise rolls at a -3 penalty by treacherously attacking. Any creature that fails the roll is surprised for the first round of combat. If the venturer has some way of secretly signaling to his party (such as Signaling proficiency) or has planned the treachery to occur in advance, then his party does not have to make the surprise roll. The art of treachery cannot be used if the NPC opposition also has a character with this power handling negotiation, due to professional courtesy and mutual paranoia. [Venturer]

**Tribulating Adversary:**Whenever an enemy within 30’ makes an attack throw, proficiency throw, or saving throw, the character can spend a Fate Point to force the enemy to re-roll the throw. The character can spend additional Fate Points to allow further re-rolls if desired. However, the character can never force a re-roll of a natural 20. [Chosen]

**Unconquerable Soul:** The character gains a +1 bonus to all saving throws. If reduced to 0 hp or less, the character can choose to remain conscious and fight on, doing so for up to four rounds. If she fights on for one round, she suffers a -2 penalty on her eventual roll on the Mortal Wounds table. If she fights on for two rounds, the penalty is increased to -5. If she fights on for three rounds, the penalty is increased to -10. If she fights on for four rounds, she dies instantly at the end of the her initiative. [Dwarven Pugilist, Warmistress]

**Undead Slaying:** The character specializes in exterminating undead, receiving a +1 bonus to his attack throws against them. With a proficiency throw of 11+, he can identify the abilities and vulnerabilities of undead creatures based on their physical appearance or manifestation. [Dwarven Tombsealer]

**Underfoot:** Monsters of large size or more suffer a -2 penalty to their attack throws against the character. [Halflings]

**Unholy Fanaticism:** See **Holy Fervor**, above.

**Unliving:** The character is not a living being and thus it does not have to breathe. It also does not have to eat and drink except for healing purposes (see below). It is also immune to all forms of disease and poison including magical ones. *This custom power counts as 2 powers if selected.* [Revenant]

**Unveil Esoteric Meaning:** The gp value of the character’s library is doubled for purposes of magical research, and he is eligible for a bonus of up to +5 (instead of +3) from library value. [Nobiran Wizard, Zaharan Sorcerer]

**Utter Domination:** The character’s henchmen have base morale scores of +4 and no longer make loyalty rolls upon suffering calamities. (Unlike Command proficiency or Battlefield Prowess power, this power does not affect mercenaries). [Elven Cultist of Iskara, Zaharan Sorcerer]

**Village Wisdom:** The character can perform minor acts of “hedge magic” useful in village life, such as alleviating cold symptoms, easing the pains of childbirth, driving away bedbugs from a mattress, removing mites and ticks from a creature, and so on. Each use takes 1 turn (10 minutes). (If your Judge is using the optional rules for cantrips from ***AXIOMS****,* this class power grants the witch the ability to learn and cast divine cantrips instead.) [Witch]

**Weapon Systems Expert**: When using technological ranged weapons, the character can cleave as if he were twice his class level and can deals an extra die of damage on an attack throw scoring an unmodified 20. [Terran Starman]

**White Luck Presence:** Whenever a reaction roll is made in the presence of the character, the reaction is rolled twice and the better (or worse, character’s choice) roll is taken. *This custom power counts as 2 or more custom powers if selected,* [Fool]

**Wilderness Evasion:** When the character guides the party in familiar territory, the party gains a +5 bonus to proficiency throws to evade wilderness encounters. The character’s party can evade wilderness encounters even when surprised provided the explorer is not surprised. The character is considered familiar with the civilized areas of his starting region as well as all territory within one 24-mile hex radius of civilized areas. With each additional level of experience, the radius increases one 24-mile hex further from civilization. [Beastmaster, Explorer]

**Wisdom of the Ages:** A character who learns the wisdom of the ages gains insight into secrets of the past, the present, and the future that are hidden from all except the gods. In game terms, the character can cast *commune*once per week. Learning the wisdom of the ages, however, requires a terrible sacrifice – the character must either pluck out his own eye, chop off his own hand, slice off his own ears, or cut off his own nose. The injury must be self-inflicted, and if it is ever healed (through magic) the runemaker loses the wisdom of the ages irrevocably. *This power should only be used in heroic fantasy campaigns where commune requires ritual magic.* [Runemaker]

**Wholeness of Body:** The character becomes **immune** to mundane poisonous damage and automatically succeeds on saving throws against poisons with effects other than immediate death. He becomes **resistant** to extraordinary poisonous damage and gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against poisons with the effect of immediate death. [Chosen, Cultist of Lotan, Mystic]

**Widespread Renown:** See **battlefield prowess**.

**Words of Command and Obedience:** The character knows how to compel creatures to his inexorable will. Any creatures summoned by the character will obey him to the best of their ability rather than seek to pervert his intention. Any creatures he conjures will depart without harming him if his concentration is broken. [Warlock, Zaharan Sorcerer]

### Custom Drawbacks

Some classes have custom drawbacks that they select in order to have additional custom powers.

**Bound Waist:** The character has endured childhood waist-training and must wear a corset. The character suffers a -4 penalty to saving throws vs. gas effects. She can never force march (even if mounted) and must rest for 2 turns every 6 turns of activity. Tragically, the character’s weakened frame now needs the support of the corset and if she removes it for more than one turn (10 minutes) penalties ensue: She loses any **glamorous aura** or equivalent power, her STR is reduced by 2/3 for all purposes, and she cannot recover hit points from natural healing. *This custom drawback counts as -1 custom power.* [Priestess of Nasga]

**Dagger Nails:** The character has dagger-like nails. She may attack with her dagger nails in melee for 1d2, 1d4, or 1d6 points of damage. She can apply poison to her dagger nails as if they were weapons (and is not harmed by the poison, even if she scratches herself.) However, she suffers a -2, -4, or -6 penalty on any proficiency throws involving fine manipulation (the penalty is equal to the maximum damage she can deal with the nails). *This custom drawback counts as -1 custom power.* [Priestess of Nasga]

**Dark Soul:** The grim embrace of death holds special perils for the characters. Whenever the deceased character rolls on the Tampering with Mortality table, he suffers a penalty on the 1d20 roll of -1 per level of experience. *This custom drawback counts as -1 custom power.* [Zaharans]

**Dead Soul***:* The revenant is dead and cursed. It is beyond the capability of magic to return the character to life. The character cannot be brought back by *restore disfigurement and disability* or by *restore life & limb*. However, the character can be reanimated back into undead using an animate *undead* spell. After the spell is cast, roll on the Tampering with Mortality table with a -1 penalty on the 1d20 roll per level of experience. *This custom drawback counts as -1 custom power.* [Revenant]

**Discomfited by Civilization:** The sights, smells, and ways of cities are foreign and offensive to them. The character suffers a penalty to reaction rolls when in urban settlements equal to 7 minus the settlement’s market value. *This custom drawback counts as -1 custom power.* [Beastmaster]

**Easily Encumbered:** The character only has a normal load of 3 stone instead of 5 stone. When carrying 3 1/6 to 4 3/6 stone their speed is reduced by one-third. When carrying 4 4/6 to 6 stone, their speed is reduced by half. When carrying more than 6 st, their encounter speed is reduced by two-thirds. Round speeds to the nearest 30’. The character can carry a maximum of 12 stone, modified by their Strength bonus or penalty. *This custom drawback counts as -1 custom power. Note that this power interacts with Short-Statured to yield the encumbered speeds for halflings.* [Halflings]

**Reverse Healing:** Regular healing spells and **potions of healing** damage the character, while reverse healing spells (such as **harm**) heal it. *This custom drawback counts as -1 custom power.* [Revenant]

**Short-Statured:** The character is Small size and weighs only 4 st. He cannot use large weapons or ordinary shields and cannot use medium weapons one-handed. The character can fight with a small weapon and halfling-size shield, with a small weapon in each hand, or with a medium-sized weapon used two-handed. Because of his shorter stride, the character’s speed is reduced by 30’. *This custom drawback only counts as* *-1/2 custom power because Smal size can be advantageous in some circumstances.* [Halflings]*.*

**Unholy:** The character may be turned like any other undead of the same HD and is vulnerable to weapons and other effects (such as holy water) which harm the undead. However, their strength of will and the importance of their mission - which brought them back from the grave - allow them a save vs. death, with a +2 bonus, to escape the effects of turning. If this save fails, a "turned" result works like a fear spell; a "destroyed" result instantly slays the character; and a "controlled" result works as a charm effect. *This custom drawback counts as -2 custom powers.* [Revenant]

**Walk on Spikes:** The character has endured childhood foot-binding and can only walk in special shoes. Her wilderness movement rate is reduced by 1/2 and she must save vs. Paralysis or fall anytime she attempts to run or charge in uneven or broken terrain. Without special shoes, the character loses any **glamorous aura** or equivalent power, her movement rate is reduced to 30’, her DEX is reduced by 2/3 for AC purposes, and she must make a save vs. Paralysis or fall each round. The penalties do not apply if the character is mounted or flying. *This custom drawback counts as -1 custom power.* [Priestess of Nasga]

**Weak:** The character suffers a -4 penalty to proficiency throws to Dungeonbashing proficiency throws. *This custom drawback counts as -1 custom power. If combined with the -1 HD penalty, as with the Halfling racial value, reduce the XP value by another 500 XP.* [Halfling]

# Chapter 13: Custom Races

Since ***ACKS II***affords you with the ability to create custom classes, and since race is integrated with class, our “toolbox” approach requires that we also provide rules for creating custom fantasy races.

## Creating a Fantasy Race

Follow these steps to create a custom fantasy race for your campaign:

1. Develop a name and concept for the fantasy race. Is it a sinister race of serpent-men with access to dark magic? Is it a titanic race of giant-sized humanoids? Perhaps it is a race of human-sized talking rabbits. The concept should drive your choice in the remaining steps.
2. Determine the ability score requirements for the race (see Requirements below).
3. Determine any modifications or restrictions that may apply to the race’s allocation of build points to the class category values (see Class Category Values below).
4. Select one or more custom powers for the fantasy race and assign them to the racial values of 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 (see Racial Powers below)
5. Calculate the cost for racial value 0.
   1. Count the total number of racial powers available at racial value 0. Remember that some racial powers count as negative, half, two, or other variable numbers of powers.
   2. For each racial power, increase the cost of the race at this value by 40 XP, or more if the power is directly applicable to all of the race’s likely classes (see Racial Powers below).
   3. For each racial power that is a spell-like ability, increase the cost of the race at this value by 65 XP + 5 XP per level of the spell (see Racial Powers below).
   4. If the race’s racial value mimics or stacks with a class category value (such as Elf and Arcane), add the cost of the mimicked class value at that level.
   5. If the race’s racial value mimics or stacks with a negative class category value (such as Halfling and HD), subtract the cost of the mimicked class value.
   6. Subtract 40 XP from this total to represent the fact that racial classes lose maximum levels of experience.
6. Calculate the cost for racial value 1, 2, 3, and 4 by repeating these steps.
7. Calculate the additional cost per level after 8.
   1. If the race’s racial value mimics a class category value (such as Elf and Arcane), divide the Racial Value XP cost at Value 4 by the cost for elf 4 (2,625) and multiply the result by 50,000. Round to the nearest 5,000. This is the additional cost per level after 8.
   2. If the race’s racial value does not mimic a class category value (such as Dwarf), divide the Racial Value XP cost at Value 4 by the cost for dwarf 4 (1,400). Pick two saving throw progressions, and for those progressions multiply the result by 10,000. For all other saving throw progressions, multiply the result by 30,000. Round to the nearest 25,000. This is the additional cost per level after 8.
   3. If the race is monstrous (as determined by you), the cost per level after 8 continues to double. Apply this rule for races that are particularly inhuman and powerful.
8. You’re finished. Time to build a class using your new fantasy race!

## Requirements

All fantasy races should have at least one attribute requirement of 9 or higher. Races whose racial value mimics the Arcane value should require Intellect 9 or higher. Races whose racial value mimics the Divine value should require Will 9 or higher. Other ability score requirements are at your discretion. Fantasy races with higher attribute requirements will tend to be available for play much less often, so setting high requirements is a useful tool to keep some races comparatively rare and exceptional.

Apart from the mechanical effect on the die roll, what does it mean for a race to have ability score requirements? For instance, what would it mean to say that “all gnome classes require a minimum Intellect and Constitution of 9 or better”? There are many ways of interpreting the requirement. Here’s a few:

* G Factor: The natural floor for gnomish intellect and health may simply be higher than it is in humans. The smartest gnome is no smarter than the smartest human, but the least intelligent gnome is as smart as the average human. (Tolkien’s elves seem to just not have any weak, dumb, slow, sickly, or unattractive members of their species.)
* GNASA Dungeonauts: Gnomish culture might carefully regulate entry into the adventuring classes. Only the most intelligent and healthy applicants are able to become adventurers. Entire government programs may exist that inflict annoying gnomish tricksters on an unsuspecting host populace.
* No Gnome Left Behind: Gnomish culture might have wonderful public schools with a commitment to education and physical fitness that assures that all gnomes reach a comfortable baseline. Those that drop out of higher education end up as adventurers, obviously.
* This Is GNOMELAND: Gnomes may systematically kill the slow and weak during childhood, allowing only those capable of bare-chested war cries in red cloaks to survive. This seems unlikely, but it’s hard to know what these diminutive races are capable of.

Which interpretation is “true” is a matter of world-building, not mechanics. For instance, in my own campaign, the Auran Empire, the meaning of the requirements varies from race to race. The ability score requirement for dwarves is because dwarves simply “are” hardier than humans; all dwarven classes require a minimum Constitution of 9 because there are no dwarves with less than that. Conversely, the nigh-impossible ability score requirements for Nobirans represent the rarity of their manifestation. Nobirans are drawn from those humans who have some divine ancestry or blood, but that divine blood only manifests rarely (only when all ability scores 11 or above). The offspring of a dwarf is always going to be a dwarf with a minimum Constitution of 9, but the offspring of a Nobiran is only potentially a Nobiran.

Since the choice of how difficult to make the requirements to meet is a matter of world-building, rather than a matter of mechanics, it does not adjust the cost of the class’s racial value.

## Class Category Values

One of the most effective tools to create a distinct fantasy race is to adjust, modify, or limit the effects of the various class category values.

### Fighting Value

Races that are less than man-sized, such as gnomes and dwarves, might be prevented from using two-handed swords or longbows. This does not adjust the cost of the class’s racial value. If the race is so small that it cannot wield any large weapons at all, and must wield medium weapons with two-hands, this counts as the Short-Statured custom power (-0.5 power cost).

Races that prefer particular weapons might encode these preferences with limitations on choices for narrow or broad weapon selections. For instance, dwarves with narrow or broad weapon selections must include at least four axes, flails, hammers, and/or maces among their selections, while elves with narrow or broad weapon selections must include at least two bows, crossbows, swords, or daggers. Gnomes with narrow or broad weapon selections must include arbalests, crossbows, and war hammers among their selections. Halflings with narrow weapon selections are limited to choosing from bola, dagger, darts, hand axe, javelin, sling, short bow, short sword, while halflings with broad weapon selections can also choose battle axe, crossbow, mace, or sword. Racial weapon preferences do not adjust the cost of the class’s racial value.

Races that are pacifistic, small, or otherwise ill-equipped for melee combat may have their Fighting Value limited. For instance, Halflings cannot allocate more than 2 points to Fighting.

Races that have extraordinary fighting skills, or who often practice fighting in addition to another profession, might allow build points allocated to the Fighting Value to stack with build points allocated to the racial value for purposes of determining the class’s fighting ability. Add the effective values to find the class’s fighting abilities, up to a maximum of 4 points.

###### Divine Category

Fantasy races that lack a relationship or devotion to the divine might be forbidden from allocating build points to the Divine value, or limited in the number of points they can allocate. If the race’s racial value indicates something like its caste, the race might be limited in the number of points it can allocate to this category by its racial value. Limits on the Divine value do not adjust the cost of the class’s racial value.

Races that have an extraordinary relationship or devotion to the divine, or who often practice divine spellcasting in addition to another profession, might have a racial value that mimics the Divine category. This increases the cost of the racial value by the equivalent value of the benefit provided. For instance, if Race 4 provides the equivalent of Divine 2, the cost of Race 4 must be increased by the cost of Divine 2. However, it is not a good idea to have a racial value that stacks with the Divine category, as the Divine category costs are not linear.

Races that are mechanically-inclined and worship craftsmanship, such as dwarves, might gain the ability to create divine constructs when they reach 9th caster level. This is such a minor benefit that it does not add to the race’s XP cost, though such “freebies” should always be used sparingly.

Remember that races whose racial value mimics the Divine value should require Will 9 or higher.

###### Arcane Category

Fantasy races that lack innate magical abilities may be forbidden from allocating build points to the Arcane category, or limited in the number of points they can allocate. If the race’s racial value indicates something like its caste, the race may be limited in the number of points it can allocate to this category by its racial value. Limits on the Arcane value do not adjust the cost of the class’s racial value.

Races that exceed the spellcasting abilities of humans, or who often practice arcane spellcasting in addition to another profession, might allow build points allocated to the Arcane Value to stack with build points allocated to the racial value for purposes of determining the class’s arcane spellcasting ability.

Stacked racial and Arcane values can reach values of 5 or greater. If so, apply the following rules. When calculating number of spells available, round fractions of 1/2 or more up; round any smaller fractions down.

* **Arcane + Race = 5:** The class has the ability to cast spells and engage in magical research as a mage, with the class’s spells per level increased by 33%. The class uses its class level for all level-dependent spell ranges, durations, and damages; these are not increased.
* **Arcane + Race = 6:** As above, but the class’s spells per level are increased by 50%.
* **Arcane + Race = 7:** As above, but the class’s spells per level are increased by 66%.
* **Arcane + Race = 8:** As above, but the class’s spells per level are increased by 100%.

Stacking increases the cost of the racial value by the equivalent value of the benefit provided. For instance, if Race 4 provides the equivalent of Arcane 2, the cost of Race 4 must be increased by the cost of Arcane 2.

Note that it is possible for a fantasy race to be forbidden from selecting the Arcane value while simultaneously having a racial value that stacks with Arcane. For instance, gnomes may never allocate build points to the Arcane category, but gnomes may gain the ability to cast arcane spells by allocating points to the Gnome Value.

### Custom Powers for your Fantasy Race

Custom powers for your fantasy race can be selected from the **Custom Power Index** in the Custom Classes chapter, or built using the rules for **Creating New Custom Powers** found in the same chapter. Except as noted below, they function exactly like class custom powers.

###### Cost of Racial Custom Powers

Some Judges will have noticed that, if they calculate the cost per custom power from the Fighting or Thievery value, it typically costs 67 to 150 XP per power. Why, then, is the default cost just 40 XP to acquire a custom power for a race?

The reason is that races are intended to serve as the chassis for multiple classes. Therefore, the racial powers should be more general in nature and less specifically useful to any given class. They are costed with a discount to reflect the fact that a typical character will find its class custom powers more important in play than its racecustom powers.

However, sometimes racial powers do apply directly to the class’s function. If a particular race tends to specialize in only one type of class, and the racial powers are directly applicable to the function of that class, then you should charge 75, 100, or even 150 XP per racial power to maintain balance. The Halfling Skills gained from Halfling 1 – 4 cost 75 XP each, for instance, as they are specially chosen to compliment the type of classes and functions that halflings fulfill in the game, and for balance purposes cannot be costed at less than equivalent Thievery value skills.

Powers such as Child-Like or Inhuman, which apply both a bonus and a penalty to reactions with specific creatures, are typically costed at 0 custom powers.

###### Cost of Racial Spell-Like Abilities

A related issue is the cost of spell-like abilities. Spell-like abilities taken as racial powers cost at least 70 XP each, more as the spell level increases. This escalating cost is contrary to the approach taken in the Custom Class chapter*,* where spell-like abilities count as one custom power each as long as they follow the usage limits (1st level spells usable at will with a casting time of 1 turn, etc.).

However, the Custom Class chapteralso specifies that “spell-like abilities should generally not appear as a class power at a level of experience lower than the spell’s level.” Racial spell-like abilities violate this rule, as the example of the gnome race shows: 1st level gnomes can begin play with 2nd level spell-like abilities. The special rules for costing racial spell-like abilities are intended to reflect this.

## Examples of Race Creation

Below we have included examples of the races in ***ACKS II***(Dwarf, Elf, Nobiran, Zaharan) as well as one race from *Heroic Fantasy Handbook* (Halflings). The races are presented in order of complexity from least to most complex.

### Nobirans

The Nobiran race is a very simple design that relies on a few racial powers for flavor combined with a Divine-affiliated racial value.

**Requirements:** Since Nobiran value mimics Divine value, the race must have a minimum Will requirement. Here the rule is moot, as we decided that Nobiran classes require a minimum 11 or better in all ability scores. This requirement makes Nobiran racial classes exceptionally difficult to qualify for. Nobirans aren’t limited in number because they have especially powerful racial powers (they don’t), but simply to reflect an in-world conceit that they are rare, divinely-touched, descendants of the gods.

**Nobiran 0:** The race receives Divine Blessing (1 power), Blood of Kings (1 power), Heroic Spirit (1 power), and Longeval (1 power), for a total of 4 powers. None of these are spell-like abilities, so the cost for them is 4 x 40 = 160 XP. However this is reduced by 40 XP in step 5(f). Therefore the cost for Nobiran 0 is 120 XP, which rounds to 125 XP.

**Nobiran 1:** The race’s racial value mimics Divine 1, so we add the cost of the mimicked class value at that level to the total. Divine 1 costs 250 XP, so the cost is 375 XP.

**Nobiran 2:** The race’s racial value mimics Divine 2, so we add the cost of the mimicked class value at that level to the total. Divine 2 costs 500 XP (i.e. an additional 250 XP over Divine 1), so the cost is 625 XP.

**Nobiran 3:** The race’s racial value mimics Divine 3, so we add the cost of the mimicked class value at that level to the total. Divine 3 costs 1000 XP (i.e. an additional 500 XP over Divine 2), so the cost is 1,125 XP.

**Nobiran 4:** The race’s racial value mimics Divine 4, so we add the cost of the mimicked class value at that level to the total. Divine 4 costs 2000 XP (i.e. an additional 1000 XP over Divine 2), so the cost is 2,125 XP.

### Zaharans

The Zaharan race is another very simple design. It relies on a few racial powers for flavor combined with racial value / Arcane value stacking. This parallels the design of the Elf value (see below) and was intended to simulate “evil elf” type races such as the Drow, Melnibonéans, or Black Numenoreans.

**Requirements:** Zaharans require Intellect, Will, and Charisma of 9 or higher. Since Zaharan value mimics Arcane value, the race had to have a minimum Intellect requirement. Having two more requirements makes the race considerably more difficult to qualify for than more common races like dwarf or elf, but not nearly so difficult as Nobiran.

**Zaharan 0:** The race receives Ancient Pacts (1 power), Zaharan Tongues (1 power), Inexorable (1 power), Dark Soul (-1 power), and After the Flesh (3 powers). None of these are spell-like abilities, so the cost for them is 5 x 40 = 200 XP. This is reduced by 40 XP in step 3(c). Therefore the cost for Zaharan 0 is 160 XP, which rounds to 150 XP. We felt that slightly undervalued the benefits of being a Zaharan, and increased this to 200 XP.

**Zaharan 1:** The race’s racial value mimics Arcane 1, so we add the cost of the mimicked class value at that level to the total. Arcane 1 costs 625 XP, so the cost is 825 XP.

**Zaharan 2:** The race’s racial value mimics Arcane 2, so we add the cost of the mimicked class value at that level to the total. Arcane 2 costs 1,250 XP, so the cost is 1,450 XP.

**Zaharan 3:** The race’s racial value mimics Arcane 3, so we add the cost of the mimicked class value at that level to the total. Arcane 3 costs 1,875 XP, so the cost is 2,075 XP.

**Zaharan 4:** The race’s racial value mimics Arcane 4, so we add the cost of the mimicked class value at that level to the total. Arcane 4 costs 2,500 XP, so the cost is 2,700 XP.

### Elves

The elf race was not so much designed as it was reverse engineered from the elf class in predecessor games. The result was that, although its similar to the Zaharan design, elven classes enjoy a 125 XP discount for the Arcane Value, a necessity to keep the elven spellsword at 4,000 XP for 2nd level. This mechanic in turn led to the cost of the Elf 4 value being reduced by 125 XP to avoid an asymmetry (Elf 3 + Arcane 1 costing less than Elf 4).

**Requirements:** All elven classes require a minimum Intellect 9 or better. Since Elf value mimics Arcane value, the class must have a minimum Intellect requirement.

**Elf 0:** The race receives Animal Friendship (0.5 powers), Attunement to Nature (1.5 powers), Connection to Nature (1 power), and Elf Tongues (1 power), for a total of 4 racial powers. None of these are spell-like abilities, so the cost for them is 4 x 40 = 160 XP. However this is reduced by 40 XP in step 5(f). Therefore the cost for Elf 0 is 120 XP, which rounds to 125 XP.

**Elf 1:** The race’s racial value mimics Arcane 1, so we add the 625 XP cost of the mimicked class value to the total, bringing it to 750 XP.

**Elf 2:** The race’s racial value mimics Arcane 2, so we add the 1,250 XP cost of the mimicked class value to the total, bringing it to 1,375 XP.

**Elf 3:** The race’s racial value mimics Arcane 3, so we add the 1,875 XP cost of the mimicked class value to the total, bringing it to 2,000 XP.

**Elf 4:** The race’s racial value mimics Arcane 3, so we add the 2,500 XP cost of the mimicked class value to the total, bringing it to 2,625 XP. At this point, we take the unusual step of *reducing* the cost of Elf 4 to 2,500 XP. The reason for this reduction is that otherwise it creates an asymmetry in the build point cost for two otherwise-identical classes. HD 1, Fighter 2, Arcane 1, Elf 3 costs 4,000 XP, while HD 1, Fighter 2, Elf 4 would cost 4,125 XP.

### Dwarves

Like the elf race, the dwarf race was not designed so much as reverse engineered from the dwarf class in ***ACKS***’s predecessor games , Unlike the elf, which in the predecessor games was reverse engineered as the equivalent of HD 1, Fighting 2, Arcane 1, Elf 3, the predecessor dwarf was built with HD 2, Fighting 2, Dwarf 0, meaning it offered no guidance as to what the higher Dwarf value should offer. If the most elven elves are arcane casters, what are the most dwarven dwarves? The choice of cumulative additional proficiencies and bonuses to proficiency throws was intended to reflect the trope of superior dwarven craftsmanship.

The tricky question for evaluating the dwarven design is to how to cost the +1/+2/+3/+4 bonus to proficiencies and thief skills. In general, a +4 bonus to a proficiency throw counts as a custom power, so a +1 bonus should equate to 0.25 custom powers. Since the bonus is applicable so widely, it should be costed at 75 XP rather than 40 XP per power. But the bonus applies to *all* proficiencies and thief skills, so the cost needs to be 75 XP x 0.25 *per* +1 *per* proficiency or thief skill. How many is that?

Calculating the average number of proficiencies or thief skills requires making some assumptions. We know every character will have two proficiencies at 1st level. Let’s assume a typical class build of HD 1, Fighting 2, Thievery 0 with two Fighting Value trade-offs. The class could have another four to six proficiencies or thief skills. It will gain another proficiency at 3rd, 5th, 9th, 11th, and 12th level, which (using trade-off mechanics) is worth a bit more than two proficiencies. The class might have one or more bonus proficiencies from Intellect. This suggests around 10 proficiencies is a serviceable baseline, and is used for the suggested costs below.

**Requirements:** All dwarven classes require a minimum Constitution 9 or better. The dwarf race is easy to qualify for without any special rules.

**Dwarf 0:** The race receives Sensitivity to Rock and Stone (1.5 powers), Dwarf Tongues (1 power), and Hardy People (3 powers), for a total of 5.5 racial powers. None of these are spell-like abilities, so the cost for them is 5.5 x 40 = 220 XP. However this is reduced by 40 XP in step 5(f) to 180 XP. We rounded this up to yield the cost for Dwarf 0 of 200 XP.

**Dwarf 1:** The race gains one extra proficiency (1 power), for a cost of 40 XP. The race gains a +1 bonus to all proficiency throws. Above we calculated a baseline of 10 proficiencies for the typical dwarven class, so the +1 bonus must cost [(10 + 1) x (1 x 0.25)] 2.75 powers. Those powers cost another (2.75 x 75) 206 XP. Therefore the additional cost for Dwarf 1 is (200 + 206) 406 XP, which we rounded down to 400 XP.

**Dwarf 2:** The race gains an additional proficiency (1 power), for a cost of 40 XP. The race gains an additional +1 bonus to all proficiency throws. Again using a baseline of 10 proficiencies for the typical dwarven class, the +2 bonus must cost [(10 + 2) x (2 x 0.25)] 6 powers. Those powers cost another (6 x 75) 450 XP. Therefore the additional cost for Dwarf 2 is (200 + 450) 650 XP, which we reduced to 600 XP.

**Dwarf 3:** The race gains an additional proficiency (1 power), for a cost of 40 XP. The race gains an additional +1 bonus to all proficiency throws. The cumulative +3 bonus must cost [(10 + 3) x (3 x 0.25)] 9.75 powers. Those powers cost another (9.75 x 75) 731 XP. Therefore the additional cost for Dwarf 3 is (200 + 731) 931 XP, which we reduced to 900 XP.

**Dwarf 4:** The race gains an additional proficiency (1 power), for a cost of 40 XP. The race gains an additional +1 bonus to all proficiency throws. The cumulative +4 bonus must cost [(10 + 4) x (4 x 0.25)] 14 powers. Those powers cost another (14 x 75) 1050 XP. Therefore the additional cost for Dwarf 4 is (200 + 1050) 1,250 XP.

### Halflings

The halfling design is unusual in that its racial values run negative – in other words, halfling classes cost less XP than human classes. The reason for the negative XP cost of the halfling value is the class’s Weak custom power, which imposes a HD type reduction. Since increasing HD by one type increases a class’s XP cost by 500 XP, reducing HD by one type is modeled by reducing the race’s XP cost at each point by 500 XP.

Another unusual aspect of the halfling design is that the halfling value affords the race a series of “halfling skills” which are especially suited to halfling adventures. Therefore these powers are costed at 75 XP each rather than the usual 40 XP.

**Requirements:** Halfling classes require a minimum Dexterity 9 or better. The halfling race is easy to qualify for without any special rules.

**Halfling 0:** The race receives Child-like (0 powers), Demi-Human Ancestry (0.5 powers), Difficult to Corrupt (1 power), Easily Encumbered (-1 power), Halfling Tongues (1 power), Heroic Breakfast (1 power), Underfoot (1 power), Short-Statured (-1/2 powers), and Weak (-1 power), for a total of 2 custom powers. None of these are spell-like abilities, so the cost for them is 2 x 40 = 80 XP. However, this is reduced by 40 XP in step 5(f) to 40 XP. In addition, the Weak power is worsened by a HD type reduction, which is the equivalent of a -1 value in the HD category (-500 XP). Therefore the cost for Halfling 0 is -460 XP, which rounds to -450 XP.

**Halfling 1:** The race receives one halfling skill. Halfling skills cost 75 XP each, so the cost for Halfling 0 is increased to -375 XP.

**Halfling 2:** The race receives one halfling skill. Halfling skills cost 75 XP each, so the cost for Halfling 0 is increased to -300 XP.

**Halfling 3:** The race receives one halfling skill. Halfling skills cost 75 XP each, so the cost for Halfling 0 is increased to -225 XP.

**Halfling 4:** The race receives one halfling skill. Halfling skills cost 75 XP each, so the cost for Halfling 0 is increased to -150 XP.

# Chapter 14: Custom Spells

The original ***ACKS***spell creation system was first presented in ***ACKS Player’s Companion****.* That system was reverse-engineered from the existing canon of D20 fantasy spells in order to justify and explain the effects of the spells. Once the model was successfully fitted to the effects of existing spells, it became possible to create new spells that would be balanced against those that had already existed. From this arose the corpus of ***ACKS***spells that has been expanded throughout our later supplements.

The revised spell creation system here has been updated based on 10 years of gameplay since the original release. Because the original system was imputed from the existing canon of D20 fantasy spells, it had “baked in” certain assumptions that proved sub-optimal for long-term campaign play. The revised system presented in this chapter is, we believe, better balanced and more likely to produce the sort of gameplay that ***ACKS***players enjoy.

Using, these rules, you can re-create about 90% of the spells that appear in ***ACKS II***or make up new spells of your own. If there’s a spell you want to adapt from another game, you can probably do so following these rules, too. Sometimes, however, you’ll find If the system can’t create the sort of spell you want and you have to go beyond the rules here. When that happens, don’t stress about it – just call the spell “esoteric” and all is well.

With your permission, players engaged in spell research can make use of these rules to design their new spells; alternatively, you can have the player describe what he wants the spell to accomplish and use these rules to create it for him.

## Determining Spell Level

### Level

Every spell has a level, which determines the caster level required to cast it. A spell’s level is determined by its number of **spell build points**. Each spell level encompasses a range of 10 spell build points: A 1st level spell is a spell costing 1 to 10 spell build points, a 2nd level spell is a spell costing 11 to 20 spell build points, and so on. The number of spell build points are calculated from the spell’s other characteristics, including its type, effect cost, target factor, duration factor, range factor, saving throw factor, and source factor. These characteristics are discussed below.

### Type

Every spell is classified according to its **spell type**, which gives a broad description of what the spell is supposed to do. A spell’s type determines the costs of all of its other characteristics, which can vary greatly between types. For example, it is much more difficult to heal wounds at long range than it is to cast an illusion, and this is reflected in the much higher range factors for healing spells.

There are 13 different types of spells: **blast**, **death**, **detection**, **elemental**, **enchantment**, **esoteric**, **healing**, **illusion**, **movement**, **protection**, **summoning**, **transmogrification**, and **wall** spells. Of those 13, all but esoteric spells can be created using this system. The esoteric type is, by definition, the type assigned to spells which cannot be built using these rules (see below).

###### Blast Spells

Blast spells can deal damage or detrimental effects to individual targets or over areas of effect through evoking a medium such as arcane force, fire, or toxic gas*. Battering ram, mage missile,* and *thunderbolt* are examples of blast spells. (In contrast, a spell that deals damage directly through magic, such as *dismember*, is a death spell.) Blast spells usually require the caster to make an attack throw or the target to make a Blast saving throw. Blast spells that require an attack throw benefit from the Battle Magic proficiency. Some blast spells also are elemental and will benefit from Elementalism proficiency.

###### Death Spells

Death spells can deal damage or detrimental effects to targets directly. Death spells also deal in necromantic energy, capable of draining and transferring life energy or animating the dead. *Animate dead*, *dismember*, and *necromantic potence*are examples of death spells. Death spells usually require their targets to make Death saves avoid their effects. Death spells benefit from the Black Lore of Zahar proficiency.

###### Detection Spells

Detection spells can discern or locate particular categories of creatures, powers, or objects within range. *Discern magic*,*locate haunting*, and*reveal ritual magic*are examples of detection spells. While very useful, detection spells can never be used to detect abstract or ambiguous concepts such as “danger” or “traps.” Detection spells do not benefit from any particular class powers or proficiencies in ***ACKS II***, although you can create these if desired.

###### Elemental Spells

Elemental spells can conjure, destroy, or manipulate one of the fundamental elements of air, earth, fire, and water. Each elemental spell denotes its sub-type in parentheses, e.g. elemental (fire). *Earth’s excrescence*, *fan of fire,* *thunderbolt,* and *wall of frost* are examples of elemental earth, fire, air, and water spells respectively. Elemental spells benefit from the Elementalism proficiency. Note that all elemental spells always belong to another type as well, and they are created as spells of that type.

###### Enchantment Spells

Enchantment spells can bewitch, dominate, halt, frighten, mesmerize, or otherwise affect the will of target creatures. *Bewitch humanoid*, *halt monster,*  and *slumber* are examples of enchantment spells. Enchantment spells are more difficult to detect than other types of spells. Enchantment spells benefit from the Mastery of Charms and Illusions.

###### Esoteric spells

Esoteric spells can produce supernatural effects that no other type of spell can. From the point of view of spellcasters in the game world, esoteric spells represent powerful dweomers discovered in ages long past which are impossible to replicate by contemporary researchers. From the point of view of the game rules, esoteric spells are simply those spells which were not created using the spell design system. Hence, there are no rules for designing esoteric spells. You just makes them up.

###### Healing Spells

Healing spells can regenerate, revitalize, or even resurrect creatures. Healing spells can be reversed to damage or kill, in which case they function like weak death spells (above). *Cure light injury,**neutralize poison*,and *restore life and limb*are examples of healing spells. Reversed healing spells can benefit from the Black Lore of Zahar proficiency, just as death spells do.

###### Illusion Spells

Illusion spells can create or suppress sensory data in the minds of those they affect. Illusion spells work by invoking a special pattern of light and/or sound that, when witnessed, triggers a particular hallucination in the mind of those who witnessed it. The pattern of the illusion has an objective existence but the hallucination it induces exists only in the mind. Because they exist in the mind, illusion spells are vulnerable to disbelief. A creature who successfully disbelieves an illusion sees or hears the pattern of the illusion but does not experience the hallucination it induces. *Chimerical figment, illusory interior,* and *mirage* are examples of illusion spells.Illusion spells benefit from the Mastery of Charms and Illusions proficiency.

###### Movement Spells

Movement spells allow creatures to move, or be moved, directly through the application of magical power. *Flight,* *teleportation*, and *telekinesis* are all movement spells. In contrast, a spell that allows a character to fly by taking on the characteristics of a bird would be a transmogrification spell. Movement spells do not benefit from any particular class powers or proficiencies in this book, although you can create these if desired.

###### Protection Spells

Protection spells enhance armor and saving throws, ward off foes, and provide protection from various spells, weapons, and elements, directly through magic. *Blast ward, holy circle,* and *shimmer* are examples of protection spells. In contrast, a spell that increased a character’s armor class by taking on the characteristics of a turtle would be a transmogrification spell. Protection spells benefit from the Bright Lore of Aura proficiency.

###### Summon Spells

Summoning spells bring creatures from “elsewhere” to serve the spellcaster. There are three sub-types of summoning spells. Callings summon creatures to arrive by means of their own locomotion to serve for a day. *Call of the wolf* is an example of a calling. Conjurations summon powerful creatures to serve the caster for a brief period of time. Conjured creatures are usually very powerful but actively hostile and must be controlled through concentration. *Conjure genie* is an example of a conjuration. Summonssummon one or more creatures for extended periods of time. *Summon hellhound* is an example of a summons. Callings are widely used by divine casters, while conjurations and summons are favored by arcane casters of a Chaotic bent. Whatever their sub-type, most summoning spells take a long time to cast and some are quite restricted in the frequency and method of use.

###### Transmogrification

Transmogrification spells transform the physical and/or mental characteristics of creatures or objects. Most transmogrification spells can only affect man-sized targets; the larger the target, the more powerful the magic required. Some transmogrification spells affect the creature’s entire being, whereas others only modify a characteristic while leaving the creature mostly unaltered. *Adjust self, transform other*, and *winged flight*are examples of transmogrification spells. Transmogrification spells benefit from the Transmogrification proficiency, naturally. Some transmogrification spells have an elemental component (usually stone) and will benefit from Elementalism proficiency.

###### Wall Spells

Wall spells create barriers of physical, elemental, or magical substance. While drawing on similar energies as blast spells, wall spells benefit from having malleable or mobile areas of effect with very long durations. *Barrier of blades*, *cloud of poison*,and *wall of thunder*are examples of wall spells. Many wall spells also are elemental and will benefit from Elementalism proficiency. Unusual wall (one might say “off the wall”) spells can sometimes benefit from other proficiencies. For example, *wall of corpses*creates a wall made of undead, and so benefits from Black Lore of Zahar.

### Effect Cost

A spell’s effect is what the spell accomplishes when it is cast. Each effect has a base cost in spell points. Effects can also have modifiers, which multiply the base cost. Some spells might have a number of effects and/or modifiers to the effects. When a spell has multiple effects, only some of which are modified, apply the modifiers to each effect separately, then sum the totals.

EXAMPLE: Dismember, a death spell, has two effects. First, it deals 1d6 damage per caster level (base cost 33 points), capped at a maximum of 3d6 damage (an effect modifier which multiplies the base cost by x0.5). Second, it causes a mortal wounds roll (base cost 60 points). The first effect costs (33 x 0.5) 16.5 points while the second effect costs 60 points. The total effect cost for Dismember is 76.5.

### Target Factor

Target is the area, creature, or object at which a spell is aimed or directed. When a spell targets an area, it affects all creatures and objects in the area, regardless of the caster’s wishes, unless it has a selective targeting modifier. When a spell targets creature or objects, the caster can choose the creatures targeted, unless the spell has a targeting modifier that prevents this (e.g. “creatures with the lowest HD must be targeted first”). Spells that can affect more creatures or objects or larger areas have higher target factors.

### Range Factor

Range is an indication of how far from the caster the spell can reach. Longer ranges cost more spell points, reflected in a higher range factor. If a spell has a range of 0’, it means the caster must be close enough to touch the target. However, the caster does not have to make an attack throw to cast a spell with a range of 0’ unless “attack throw required” is selected as a targeting modifier. Spells with a range of 0’ that require an attack throw are designated as **touch** range.

### Duration Factor

A spell’s duration is the length of time the effects of the spell last. Longer durations cost more spell points, reflected in a higher duration factor. Most spells have a duration measured in time, such as rounds, turns, minutes, hours, or days. A duration of **instantaneous** means that the spell’s effects energy come and go the instant the spell is cast, though the consequences might be long-lasting. A duration of **perpetual** means that the spell effects lasts until either the caster decides to stop sustaining the spell at the start of his initiative; the caster or the target creature dies; or the spell is dispelled. (A perpetual spell cast by an object on a creature ends when the creature dies, without regard for the creator’s life or death.) A duration of **indefinite** means the spell lasts until a particular circumstances causes it to end. The circumstances that end the spell will be described in the spell description; they might be a saving throw by the target creature, a loss of concentration by the caster, or other factors.

### Saving Throw Factor

Whether or not a spell permits a saving throw will greatly affect its cost. Spells without a saving throw have high saving throw factors. Spells which can be avoided entirely with a saving throw have lower saving throw factors. Spells which can be partly avoided with a saving throw have save factors mid-way in between. Spells which have only beneficial effects always have a saving throw factor of 1.

A spell’s source factor will depend on the type of spell and the source of the magic. For example, arcane magic excels at creating blast spells (source factor x1) while divine magic is poor at doing so (source factor x2.25). A spell’s source is either arcane, divine, or eldritch. Arcane and divine magic were introduced in the ***ACKS******II Revised Rulebook****.* Eldritch magic is presented in ***ACKS Heroic Fantasy Handbook****;* if you are not using this supplement, you can ignore all references to eldritch magic in the source factors.

## Building a Spell

When building a spell, begin by choosing the spell’s type. Once the spell type is selected, consult the appropriate Spell Characteristics table, and choose (in order) the effect(s), target(s), duration, range, saving throw, and source of the spell. Each of these characteristics will have an associated spell point cost.

The spell’s cost in spell points is calculated as:

(Base cost of all effects) x (target factor) x (duration factor) x (range factor) x (saving throw factor) x (source factor)

Round the final value to the nearest whole number. Round .5 down if the preceding number is even, up if odd.

### Spells with More Spell Build Points

It is evident from even casual perusal of the ***ACKS II***spell lists that spells of the same level sometimes vary in power. The most powerful spells of any given spell level outshine their peers, and often equal or exceed the power of spells of greater levels. These spell power guidelines assume that the disparity in spell power has occurred because of magical experimentation. Over eons of magical research, pioneering spellcasters have occasionally achieved breakthroughs that created now-famous spells such as *fireball*.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Breakthrough** | **Spell Build Points** |
| Minor | +5 |
| Major | +10 |
| Revolutionary | +20 |

Spellcasters who research new spells using these guidelines can replicate mighty incantations as *fireball* by making breakthroughs through experimentation that provide additional spell build points. A minor breakthrough grants 5 additional spell build points. A major breakthrough grants 10 additional spell build points. A revolutionary breakthrough grants 20 additional spell build points.

###### Blast Spell Notes

To prevent low level spells from dealing very high damage, all damaging spells deal variable damage based on the level of the caster. To create damaging spells with a fixed damage, select an appropriate variable damage, and then apply a maximum damage modifier that’s equal to or lower than the caster level required to cast the spell. For example, to cast a 3rd level spell, a caster must be level 5, so if a 3rd level spell deals 1d6 damage per caster level with a maximum of 3d damage, then it effectively deals a flat 3d6 damage.

Blast spells can deal any physical damage type (acidic, arcane, bludgeoning, piercing, poisonous, or slashing). Blast spells with an elemental modifier can deal a physical damage type or an elemental damage type (cold, electric, fire, or seismic).

All damage caused by blast spells is always inflicted instantaneously. Some effects caused by blast spells are inflicted instantaneously. When blast spells deal instantaneous effects, but the spell itself has a duration, the duration can either allow the spellcaster to (a) apply the effect to the same target each round of the duration or (b) to apply the effect to new targets on subsequent rounds. If option (b) is chosen, the spell must be re-targeted each round, with any consequent attack throws and saving throws being re-rolled.

Some effects caused by blast spells have a temporary effect. In this case, the spell’s duration determines how long the effect lasts.

###### Death Spell Notes

To prevent low level spells from dealing very high damage, all damaging spells deal variable damage based on the level of the caster. See **blast spells**, above, for a fuller discussion on these mechanics.

Death spells that target living creatures can deal any physical damage type (acidic, arcane, bludgeoning, piercing, poisoning, slashing) or necrotic damage. Death spells that only target undead deal luminous damage.

Most damage and effects caused by death spells are inflicted instantaneously. When death spells deal instantaneous effects, but the spell itself has a duration, the duration can either allow the spellcaster to (a) apply the effect to the same target each round of the duration or (b) to apply the effect to new targets on subsequent rounds. If option (b) is chosen, the spell must be re-targeted each round, with any consequent attack throws and saving throws being re-rolled.

Some effects caused by death spells have a temporary effect. In this case, the spell’s duration determines how long the effect lasts.

Some death spells have an instantaneous duration but do not take effect immediately. This can represent, e.g., slow-acting poison. A character affected by such a death spell knows he is affected and can take steps to avoid it, such as by using *neutralize poison*.

A death spell that causes a destructive effect on its targets must permit a saving throw, unless the spell has either a targeting factor that limits it by total HD, or a targeting modifier limiting it to creatures of certain HD or less. Death spells that target areas of effect cannot apply modifiers limited to targeting creatures of particular HD because they are not targeting creatures.

**Discern:** These spells generally allow the caster to discern whether some or all areas, creatures, and objects within range and line of sight possess a particular quality (such as being evil, invisible, magical, poisonous, or textual). In the case of text, the caster learns the gist of its message. In the case of invisibility, the caster sees the invisible creature or object as a translucent shape. In other cases, the caster sees a glow emanating from the area, creature, or object. By default, bewitchment glows rosy pink; curse glows vivid purpureus; evil glows sinister crimson; good glows bright cobalt; magic glows pale yellow; metal glows rust red; poison glows sickly green; ritual magic glows royal purple; treasure glows iridescent gold; and undead glow bone white. Spellcasters can influence this color by their spell signature if desired.

**Locate:** These spells reveals the direction and approximate distance to either the nearest or to a specific area, creature or object within range that possesses a particular quality. If there is nothing qualified in range, the caster learns that instead. If a qualifying area, creature, or object comes into range later in the duration of the spell, the caster will learn the direction and approximate distance at that time. Locate spells can penetrate earth, stone, and wood but are blocked by even a thin sheet of lead or gold.

###### Enchantment Spell Notes

An enchantment spell must either offer a saving throw or have a targeting factor that limits it to some maximum number of HD. If the targeting factor is based on a number of creatures or an area of effect, the spell must offer a saving throw.

In order for an enchantment spell to affect incarnations or undead, it must first be limited to either good or evil creatures. Such a spell can, however, ignore the enchantment immunity these creatures ordinarily possess.

For an enchantment spell to have a targeting modifier limiting it to only creatures of under a certain HD, it cannot have a targeting factor based on a limited number of HD. For instance, you cannot pair “6 HD of creatures” with “creatures with 5 HD or more cannot be targeted. It can be used with an area of effect spell (unlike Death spells), but if so cannot stack with a creature type modifier.

If a spell can target more than one creature, a saving throw modifier can be applied to cause -2 penalty for targeting a single creature. This saving throw modifier cannot be applied to area of effect spells, e.g. you cannot turn an area of effect spell into a single target spell for x1.1!

###### Healing Spell Notes

Damage and trauma cured or caused by healing spells is always inflicted instantaneously. When healing spells are assigned a duration, the duration allows the spellcaster to apply the effect to additional targets on subsequent rounds. For example, a spell curing 1d6+1 damage with a duration of one round per level could heal the same target, or multiple targets, 1d6+1 per round over several rounds.

###### Illusion Spell Notes

One of the least-understood aspects of magic is the nature by which illusion spells function. Some experts mistakenly believe that illusions create actual sensory phenomena. Such theorists claim that when a caster creates an illusion of a horse, an actual image of a horse becomes manifest through magical manipulation of light. However, these sages are unable to explain how an actual sensory phenomenon can be disbelieved. Other experts mistakenly believe that illusions create purely mental phenomenon that exist only in the mind of those who observe the illusion. However, these theorists offer no explanation for how an illusion spell could thereby affect thousands of spectators, many of whom might be out of the line of sight of the caster. This theory would require that a humble *phantasmal figment* be more powerful than the mightiest enchantment! In actuality, illusions work by creating patterns of sensation that hypnotically trigger hallucinations in those who experience the sensations.

Consider a lunatic prone to hallucinations, one whose mother used to bake vanilla cookies for him. One day the lunatic visits a bakery and smells vanilla cookies baking. He immediately experiences powerful memories of his mother, so vivid as to make her seem like she is in the bakery with him. The smell of the vanilla cookies is the pattern of sensation; the image of his mother is the hallucination that it causes in his mind. If the lunatic disbelieves the hallucination of his mother’s presence, the smell of vanilla cookies remains. If the lunatic had nose plugs and could not smell the vanilla cookies, he would not have the hallucination at all. In like manner, a subject who is exposed to a spell’s pattern of sensation is triggered into hallucinating the desired image, sound, or other sensation; disbelieving the experienced sensation reveals the underlying false pattern.

###### Movement Spell Notes

Although the movement spells in ***ACKS II***are relatively innocuous, movement spells as a whole are the most likely type of spell to cause unexpected holistic change to a campaign setting that cause it to depart from its ancient or medieval analogs.

The availability of no-risk teleportation, in particular, radically changes a game world, as does any type of easily accessible flight. Unless you are aiming for a world that is more “fantastical” or “gonzo” than the Auran Empire, we recommend that you restrict flight to spells of 3rd level or higher and forbid long-distance error-free teleportation.

Similarly, broad use of telekinesis on large and weighty objects can radically change a game world’s architecture and building. Therefore, no non-esoteric movement spell can ever grant the ability to move a creature or object weighing more than 285 st/level or 2000 st (spell creator’s choice).

###### Protection Spell Notes

Protection spells come in five types: armors, enhancements, magic invulnerabilities, deflections/resistances/invulnerabilities, and dispels/negations/wards.

**Armors:** Armor spells grant the recipient of the spell a fixed armor class. Armor spellsare not affected by any modifiers to AC except for DEX.

**Enhancements:** Enhancement spells grant the recipient of the spell a bonus to his armor class, saving throw(s), or both. The bonus to AC stacks with both worn armor and any other enhancements to AC except another enhancement spell. The bonus to saving throws stacks with any other bonuses except another enhancement spell.

**Magic Invulnerabilities:** These spells render the recipient immune to one or more individual spells, spells of a certain type, or spells of a certain level. The recipient automatically succeeds on saving throws against the spell(s), and suffers no damage from their effects.

**Deflections/Invulnerabilities/Resistances:** These spells protect the recipient against various types of attacks and damage.

* *Deflections* cause melee and/or missile attacks dealing mundane damage to automatically miss the recipient, as per the spell *deflect ordinary missiles* and *deflect ordinary weapons*.
* *Invulnerabilities* render the target immune to one or more damage types. The recipient automatically succeeds on saving throws against any effects that deal damage of the chosen type(s), and suffers no damage from the chosen type(s).
* *Resistances* render the recipient immune to mundane damage of the chosen type, such that it automatically succeeds on saving throws against spells or effects that deal mundane damage of the chosen type. It also becomes resistant to extraordinary damage of the chosen type. The recipient reduces the extraordinary damage dealt by the chosen type by half and gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against spells or special abilities that deal extraordinary damage of the chosen type.

**Dispels/Negations/Wards:** Dispels extinguish spell and spell-like effects, as per the spell *dispel magic*. Dispels with an instantaneous duration take effect upon casting. Dispels with a longer duration take effect when a creature, object, or spell enters or exits its area of effect or attempts to affect its recipient (as in *anti-magic sphere*). An inherent aspect of casting a *dispel magic* is that the caster must make an attack throw versus each spell or spell-like effect he might extinguish, as described in the spell *dispel magic.* (A saving throw can be applied on top, as with *counterspell*).

Negations render activated, at-will, and charged magic items temporarily inert and unable to be used for the duration of the spell. They have no effect on permanent items.

Wards against creatures protect the recipient against a particular creature or creature type, as per the spell *holy circle*. Wards against spells (spellwards) protect the recipient against spells, as per the spell *spellward*.

###### Summoning Spell Notes

Most summoning spells meet one of three formats, each of which follows its own rules. Following, or not following, these formats change the source modifier for the spells.

**Callings:** A callis a spell that summons creatures to arrive by means of their own locomotion (x0.66) with a duration of at least 1 day (x1.5). A call must target a specific type of creature (x0.7). A call always takes one turn to cast (x0.8). Called creatures are controlled with speech and gesture (x0.8). Called creatures always cooperate with the caster as if **bewitched** (x1).The range of a calling is usually 10’ (x1). By fiat, if the same calling is cast again while the creature called is still alive, it keeps the creature(s) around for another day. A call cannot require concentration and cannot be limited by castings per day. It cannot permit a saving throw. A calling cannot be used to summon a sapient creature.

**Conjurations**: A conjuration is a spell thatsummons powerful creatures to serve the caster for a short period of time of up to 1 day (x1.5). Conjured creatures are always actively hostile (x0.6) and must be controlled through concentration (x0.6). The duration must be at least 6 turns (x0.75). The range of a conjuration must be at least 240’ (x1.33). A conjuration can permit a saving throw, rolled by the creature being conjured. If the creature’s save succeeds, it appears but not is controlled.

**Summonings:** Spells thatsummon one or more creatures for extended periods of time with a duration of at least 1 day (x1.5). Summoned creatures are always passively hostile (x0.8), following the caster’s commands but in the least cooperative manner possible. They can be controlled telepathically (x1) or by speech and gesture (x0.8). Summonings are limited by frequency of casting, to no more than once per day (x0.9) for a day’s duration or once per week (x0.8) for longer durations, so that a caster cannot have an endless number of summoned creatures dispatched at once. A summoning can permit a saving throw, rolled by the creature being summoned. If the save succeeds, the creature learns the name and location of its summoner, and does not appear

Range is the range at which a creature can be mentally given commands. If this range is exceeded, the creature cannot be given new commands and if concentration is required to control the creature, it breaks free of control. If the creature is summoned from thin air, range is also the maximum range at which it can first appear from the caster. Range is largely irrelevant to called creatures controlled with speech and gesture.

Unless otherwise noted, a summoned creature does not gain any power to communicate with its controller, nor does the controller gain access to its senses. He commands his creatures with each speech and gesture (crudely, if the creature is not sapient!) or with one-way telepathic commands. Actively hostile creatures must be controlled with total concentration. Cooperative or passively hostile creatures can be given general commands, though the latter will attempt to subvert them where possible.

###### Transmogrification Spell Notes

By default, the target of a transmogrification must be a man-sized creature. Targeting larger creatures requires applying a modifier of x1.25 to x2. Targeting smaller creatures requires applying a modifier of x2. This limitation is particularly important for transmogrification spells that affect the current form of the creature.

Transmogrification spells that transform the creature into a new form are not limited by the size of the new form (only the original form). However, they have other complexities, as the transmogrification entails differentiating physical form, physical characteristics, physical attacks, special abilities, and mental abilities.

**Physical Form:** The creature’s general body plan including number of limbs and general distribution of fat and muscle; the creature’s exterior characteristics such as texture, shape, and color of hair, skin, scales, feathers; and its facial visage and appearance.

**Physical Characteristics**: The creature’s size, weight, armor class, and movement rate, including special movement types such as climbing, flying, and swimming, provided that doing so is a result of their body form and not magic. The monster special abilities of Flying, Swiftness, and Tough are implicitly included in this.

**Physical Attacks:** The creature’s attack routine, including its number of attacks, attack throws, and damage. The monster special abilities Acid, Bonus Attack, Charge, Dive, Grab/Restrain, Hug, Lightning Reflexes, Ongoing Damage, Special Senses, Stealth, Swallow Attack, Topple and Fling, Trample, and Vicious Bite are generally included in this, although the Judge has final say about whether a particular special ability is “physical.”

**Special Abilities:** The creature’s special or spell-like abilities that are not included under Physical Characteristics or Attacks. The monster special abilities Aura, Berserk, Breath Weapon, Beguile/Enthrall, Class Powers/Proficiencies, Dreadful, Enervation, Enslave, Horrific, Immunity, Incorporeal, Infectious, Invisibility, Magic Resistance, Ongoing Damage, Paralysis, Petrification, Regeneration, Resistance, Spellcasting, Spell-like Abilities, Terrifying, and Unusual abilities are covered by this.

A default transmogrification allows the new form to have one \* worth of special abilities. Custom spells can permit more special abilities. If a new form has more special abilities than granted by the spell, you chooses which special abilities are gained, starting with the form’s weakest special abilities.

**Mental Abilities:** The creature’s alignment, behavioral traits, mental ability, morale score, and natural instincts. If the new form is as or more intelligent than the old form, the creature remembers its former life as if a dream. If the new form is substantially less intelligent, the target does not remember its former life at all. This effect is usually only applied to forms with bestial or semi-sapient intellect, because it is substantially more costly to grant the mental abilities of a sapient form.

###### Wall Spell Notes

A wall thickness modifier can only be applied if wall can be affected as iron, stone, earth, flesh, or wood (e.g. it has SHP or hit points). Otherwise the wall thickness modifier is x1, as the thickness is irrelevant to the spell’s effectiveness.

# Chapter 15: Custom Magic Types

In ***ACKS II***, we presented just two types of magic: **divine magic** and **arcane magic**. All of the spellcasting character classes use one or both of these types of magic. The two types of characters represent the most common and popular archetypes of myth, legend, film, and literature. However, they also incorporate certain assumptions that might not be appropriate for every setting. For instance, in a setting similar to Robert E. Howard’s Hyboria, you might want sorcery-wielding priests who can heal and animate the dead, but learn their spells through study like mages.

The rules that follow enable Judges to create new **magic types** with different characteristics that can be used with the *Players’ Companion* to create very different spellcasting classes. To create a new type of magic, follow these ten steps:

1. Develop a name and concept for the new magic type. Is it an art of illusions and dweomers, such as appears in fairy tales? Perhaps it is a sinister sorcery devoted to mind-control and summoning. The concept should drive your choices in the remaining steps.
2. Set the magic type’s **source factors** for each of the 11 spell types. No source factor can be less than 1 or greater than 2.25, and the sum of all source factors must be at least 11 and no more than 15. See **Source Factors** section.
3. Use the magic type’s source factors to calculate the magic type’s **Base XP Cost**. See the **Source Factors** section.
4. Choose a spell progression for the magic type. Spells progressions can be standard (mage), alternative (crusader), or improved. Adjust the Base XP Cost as directed. See the **Spell Progression** section.
5. Determine how the magic type acquires its spell repertoire, through **prayer**, **study**, or **inheritance**. See the **Spell Repertoire** section.
6. Decide whether the magic type carries a **code of behavior**. See the **Codes of Behavior** section.
7. Use the Base XP Cost and spell progression to create the magic type’s **class category value**. This class category value will be used when making custom classes that use the magic type. See the **Magic Type Class Category** section.
8. Choose the methods of **magic research** open to the magic type’s classes. See the **Magic Research** section.
9. Determine what **saving throw progression** the magic type’s class category value results in. See the **Saving Throw Progression** section.
10. Create a spell list for your new magic type. This spell list will serve as the basis from which studious and inherited casters of the new type learn spells, or from which prayerful caster classes select their repertoire.

Once these ten steps are complete, the new magic type is ready for use in your custom classes.

## Source Factor per Spell Type

As explained in the ***ACKS II Revised Rulebook****,* all spells are categorized into **spell types**, which are broad descriptions of what spells are supposed to do. There are 12 different **spell types**: Blast, Death, Detection, Enchantment, Esoteric, Healing, Illusion, Movement, Protection, Summoning, Transmogrification, and Wall. Esoteric spells are always created by you outside the strict categories of the game rules, so they are excluded from these mechanics. For each of the remaining 11 types, each magic type will have a different **source factor**. The lower the source factor, the easier it is for the spellcaster to cast spells of that type. For example, arcane magic excels in Blast type spells (source factor 1) while divine magic is very poor at this type (source factor 2.25). Conversely, divine magic excels at Healing spells (source factor 1) while arcane magic is sub-par at this type (source factor 2).

The first step in creating a new magic type is to choose a source factor for each of the 11 spell types. Each spell type must have a source factor of at least 1 and no more than 2.25. Write down your magic type’s source factors in the appropriate rows of the Type Modifier column of the Source Factor Construction table, below.

Now total all of the source factors and enter the sum in the Total row of the Type Modifier column. This is the type’s **source factor total**. The source factor total must be at least 11 and no more than 15. If source factor total is not within this range, increase or decrease your source factors until the sum of their values is between 11 and 15.

The lower the source factor total, the more powerful the magic type and the more XP it will cost to advance in classes which use that type of magic. For reference, the arcane magic type has a source factor total of 12.5, while the divine magic type has a source factor total of 15.

Next, find the difference between the Base Modifier listed on the table and the Type Modifier you wrote down in each row. Enter this value in the Variance column. Then multiply each Variance by the appropriate Cost of Variance to determine the Type Cost of that spell type. Total all of the Type Costs and enter the sum in the Total row of the Type Cost column.

Finally, add the value you wrote down in the Type Cost column to 500. The resulting sum is the **Base XP Cost** of the new magic type you’ve created. Round this value to the closest value divisible by 25. Base XP Cost can never be lower than 500 XP; if less, increase or decrease your source factors until Base XP Cost is at least 500.

EXAMPLE: Below are three completed Source Factor Construction tables. The first table is for the Divine magic type (used by crusaders), the second table is for the Arcane magic type (used by mages) and the third table is for a new magic type called Faery. The Faery magic type excels at enchantments, illusion, transformation, and similar glamours, but is poor at blast and death spells.

| Total | 15.0 |  | 12.75 |  | n/a |  | n/a |  | 1,000 | + 500 = | 1,500 |

EXAMPLE (cont.): As can be seen, the Faery magic type is mid-way between the power and XP cost of the Arcane and Divine magic types. It has a Base XP Cost of 1,500 XP, lower than the Arcane type’s Base XP Cost of 2,500 but higher than the Divine type’s Base XP Cost of 500 XP.

**A Note on Source Factors:** The custom magic type construction rules require that each spell type be assigned a specific source factor. This is not always a simple matter, however. The source factor for Detection spells is subject to a host of modifiers that can make the source factor as high as x3 for some spells (e.g. arcane detection of curse). The source factor for Enchantment spells is even more ambiguous, as there are several source factors listed, depending on the type of effect, from x1 to x1.5 for Arcane and from x1 to x1.5 for Divine, again with source modifier factor stacked on top.

To calculate the source factor for Detection spells, we assumed that each effect is approximately equal, and then calculated an average source factor for all of the effects. There are 13 different effects listed. Divine magic has a source factor of x1 on nine of these; x1.5 on two of these; and x2 on the last two. The average source factor is [(1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 +1 + 1 + 1.5 + 1.5 + 2 + 2) / 13] = 1.23. We rounded this to 1.25.

For your own magic types, you can create similarly complex source factors and source factor modifiers if desired, at the cost of some math scribbling. If you want a custom magic type to have precisely the same factors as Arcane or Divine magic, just use the ones listed above – we’ve done the math for you. The fact that Faery type magic has a Detection source factor of 1.25 (same as Divine) could be understood to mean it builds Detection spells using the source modifier factors for Divine magic. But you could also disregard those complexities and simply build Faery spells with a source factor of x1.25, making it better than Divine magic at detecting treasure or secret doors, but worse at detecting evil or danger, for instance. This decision should be made when the magic type is created!

###### Specialized Magic types

The source factor rules above assume that all types of magic are capable of casting all 11 types of spells, albeit at greater or lesser effectiveness. Particular classes that use that type of magic, or particular characters of that class, might be specialized but the magic type itself is not.

In some cases, you might wish to create a type of magic which is itself specialized. Perhaps he wants to create an evil type of sorcery that can only be used for death and summoning spells, or an elemental magic that can only be used for blast and wall spells. Because of this specialization, the magic type might be better at certain spells than is otherwise possible in the rules. For this reason, specialized magic types must be used carefully.

To create a specialized magic type, simply remove one or more of the 11 spell types. Cross them out on the Source Factor Construction table – do not write down a type modifier for them and do not calculate a variance. For each spell type removed from the Source Factor Construction table, the magic type’s minimum source factor totals are reduced by 1.125, and its Base XP Cost is reduced by 45. (Base XP Cost must still be at least 500, however).

Source factor modifiers for specialized magic types must always be equal to or lower than the base modifier for that type, to a minimum of 1. (You cannot have a specialized school of magic that is bad in casting its specialty!) Some specialized schools of magics might have some source factors below 1. If two spell types unavailable to the magic type, the minimum source factor for one spell type is reduced from 1 to 0.75. If four spell types are unavailable, the minimum source factor for two spell types is reduced from 1 to 0.75. Finally, if six or more spell types are unavailable, the minimum source factor for three spell types is reduced from 1 to 0.75.

EXAMPLE: The Judge decides to create a magic type called Battlelore. Battlelore can only use Blast, Death, Protection, and Wall spells. This eliminates Detection, Enchantment, Illusion, Movement, Summoning, and Transmogrification, or 7 spell types. Battlelore’s minimum source factor total is [11 – (7 x 1.125)] 3.125. Its Base XP Cost is reduced by (7 x 45) 315 points. Since six or more spell types are unavailable to the magic type, up to three spell types can have source factors as low as 0.75. Battlelore’s source factors are set at Blast 0.75, Death 1, Protection 0.75, and Wall 0.75, for a source factor total of 3.25. Its Base XP Cost works out to 2,310, which rounds to 2,300. Battlelore has far less flexibility than Arcane magic, but a 6th blast, protection, or wall spell using Battlelore could be as powerful as an 8th level spell using Arcane magic!

## Spell Progression Tables

The number and levels of spells a caster can use in a single day are determined by cross-referencing the caster’s effective level of experience with his magic types’ spell progression table. There are three available spell progression tables: the standard, alternative, and improved progression.

**Standard:** The standard progression allows the caster to use spells of increasingly high level with every other level of experience earned. It gradually but slowly accumulates spells of the lower levels with every level of experience earned. In the ***Player’s Companion****,* the standard progression is referred to as the “mage” progression, as it is used by mages and (in form or another) all other Arcane casters. Choosing the standard progression does not adjust the magic type’s Base XP Cost.

**Alternative:** At first glance, the alternative progression looks much weaker than the standard progression. It never offers access to 6th level spells, and it doesn’t even offer spells at all until 2nd level. These disadvantages are counter-balanced by two advantages: It gets 4th and 5th level spells much faster than the standard progression, and at higher levels it offers 50% more spells per day within each spell level. Choosing the alternative progression does not adjust the magic type’s Base XP Cost.

**Improved:** The improved progression offers faster access to low- and high-level spells than the standard progression, more spells at higher level than the standard progression, and higher-level spells overall than the alternative progressions. Choosing the improved progression increases the magic type’s Base XP Cost by 13.5%. Round the Base XP Cost up to the nearest divisor of 25.

EXAMPLE #1: The Arcane magic type in ***ACKS***and **ACKS *II****,* and the Divine magic type in ***ACKS II****,* all use the standard spell progression.

EXAMPLE #2: The Divine magic type in ***ACKS***used the alternative spell progression.

EXAMPLE #3: The Judge decides that the Faery magic type will use the alternative spell progression, to represent that faery magic lacks the raw power of arcane magic (no 6th level spells). This does not adjust its Base XP Cost.

EXAMPLE #4: The Judge decides that the Battlelore magic type will use the improved spell progression, to represent the unwavering devotion to magical mastery its elite practitioners display. This increases its Base XP by 13.5% from 2,300 to 2,610, rounded to 2,600.

Each of these three progressions can occur at 33%, 40%, 50%, 66%, 75%, 100%, 133%, and 150% power depending how many points a character class using the magic type allocates to its value. The 33%, 40%, 50%, 66%, and 75% progressions can also, if desired, be delayed progressions that start some point after 1st level.

Note that there are two different delayed 50% progressions. Progression A is used when the magic type has a Base XP Cost of less than 1,000. Progression B is used when the magic type has a Base XP Cost of 2000 or more. (The 50% progression is not available to magic types with a Base XP Cost of 1,000 to 2,000). See Magic Type Class Category (p. XX) for more details.

## Spell Repertoire

The spells available to a spellcaster are called his **spell repertoire**.Practitioners ofdifferent types of magic acquire their repertoire in very different ways. There are three mutually exclusive ways that casters of a particular type of magic might acquire its spells, **prayer, study**, and **inheritance**. Casters and magic types which use these methods are called **prayerful,** **studious,** and **inherited** respectively.

In ***ACKS II****,* all arcane magic is studious, and most divine magic is prayerful. (Dwarven craftpriests and witches use studious divine magic.) When creating a custom magic type, however, you have complete freedom. A magic type’s source factors for spell type, its spell progression, and its method of learning spells are all distinct choices when using these rules!

### Prayerful

Prayerful magic is acquired from beseeching extraplanar sources. Prayerful casters receive their repertoires from prayer to the deity, demon, elemental lord, god, or other power they serve. In order to maintain these repertoires they must pray each day. Each prayerful caster has a repertoire consisting of a flat number of spells of each level they can cast, representing those miracles the deity has empowered them to perform.

###### Number of Spells in Repertoire

The number of spells of each level in a prayerful caster’s repertoire is equal to (5000 / Base XP Cost), rounded up. If the caster has more or less than a full level progression, this repertoire may be increased or decreased. See the **Magic Type Class Category** section, below.

EXAMPLE: The Faery magic type has a Base XP Cost of 1,500. If the Faery magic type were prayerful, it would have a repertoire of (5000 / 1,500) = 3.33, rounded up to 4, spells per level. This Judge decides to select a different repertoire acquisition method.

Do *not* select spells for the repertoire now! The selection of spells in a prayerful spell repertoire comes when custom classes are created that use the magic type. The exact spells available for any given prayerful caster class could vary widely. For example, the Crusader Spell List, Shaman Spell List, and Bladedancer Spell List in ***ACKS II***are all examples of the same magic type, Divine, but their spell repertoires vary considerably.

###### Prayer Requirement

To stay in the favor of his deity, a prayerful spellcaster must pray at an appointed time (usually sunrise or sunset) for at least one hour per day. This prayer counts as an ancillary activity. A prayerful spellcaster who fails to pray at the appointed time more than once in any seven days becomes **disfavored** by his deity. A prayerful caster can also become disfavored if he fails to uphold his class’s code of behavior (Judge’s discretion). Each time a disfavored castercasts a spell, he must roll 1d6. On a 1-2, the spell fails. The failed spell still counts against the number of spells he can cast per day. Disfavor from failure to pray ends as soon as the caster meets his daily prayer requirement. Undead in *torpor* (p. XX) never become disfavored for failing to pray, as the dark god knows why they slumber.

###### Reversed Spell

Prayerful spellcasters will know both the normal and reversed form of any spell on their spell list. However, Lawful prayerful spellcasters prefer to cast spells in their normal form, and will use the reversed forms only against Chaotic opponents**.** Conversely, Chaotic prayerful spellcasters will freely cast reversed spells, while using the normal version only to aid comrades and followers. Some prayerful spellcasters may be restricted entirely by their deity from using normal or reversed versions of particular spells (Judge’s discretion).

### Studious

Studious magic is acquired from intense study. Studious casters receive their repertoire of spells from the study of **spell formulas**.In order to maintain these repertoires they must study the formulas each day. A spell formula consists of various texts, diagrams, illustrations, and charts written on one or more pieces of paper (or equivalent material). A spell’s formula always takes up one page (or equivalent) per spell level. A caster must be able to read the language used in the formula in order to study it, making the ability to speak many languages very valuable for every studious caster.

###### Number of Spells in Repertoire

Each studious spellcaster has his own unique repertoire of spells determined by the spell formulas he frequently studies. It might be just one spell or dozens. The maximum number and level of spells in a studious caster’s repertoire is equal to the number and level of spells he can cast per day. This maximum is increased by the caster’s Intellect bonus. Thus studious casters of limited experience and middling Intellect are restricted to small repertoires while powerful and intelligent casters can have large repertoires.

To organize their collection of spell formulas, studious casters gather them together in **spell books**.A spell book can be, but does not have to be, an actual codex. Some spell books are true works of art, cased in precious metal or rare wood, with vellum pages illumined and illustrated with colorful inks. Others resemble a pile of scrolls shoved in a box in alphabetic order. A typical spellbook is a sturdy leatherbound parchment codex with 100 pages. A blank 100-page spell book costs 20gp.

A 1st level studious spellcaster starts the game with a base of one 1st level spell in his repertoire, plus one additional 1st level spell per point of Intellect bonus. Each time he advances in level, a studious spellcasters increases his maximum repertoire by one or more spells. To take advantage of this increased maximum, the caster will need to acquire the spell formulas for the spells he wants to add to his repertoire. There are a number of ways in which a studious caster can acquire spell formulas.

* He can copy a spell formula from a magic scroll, fellow mage’s spell book, or other source straight into his own spell book. He can copy an existing formula at a rate of one page per day of dedicated activity, plus one page per rank in Art (calligraphy) or Craft (scribing). The caster cannot engage in any other major activity that day. He must have a book with blank pages available to copy into.
* He can buy or steal a spell formula or even an entire spell book from another mage. In this case, he does not need to re-write a formula in his own hand unless he wants to; some casters are comfortable having their spell formula spread out across many volumes by different authors. Others are more fastidious and prefer to copy each spell formula they find in their own hand, perhaps translating it into a preferred language as they do.
* He can engage in spell research in order to discover the formula for an existing or new spell. Spell research is a lengthy and expensive proposition that only can be pursued by experienced casters.
* Whatever method the caster uses to get the spell formula, the next step will be to put it in his repertoire, either by adding it to an incomplete repertoire or replacing an existing spell in a full repertoire.

###### Adding or Replacing Spells

If a studious caster has fewer spells in his repertoire than his permitted maximum, he can add a spell to his repertoire by studying its spell formula as a dedicated activity for one week. When he has finished his week of intense study, he can add the spell to his repertoire.

If a studious caster already has the maximum number of spells in his repertoire, he can replace a spell in his repertoire with a new spell of the same level. He still must dedicate a week to studying the new spell formula, but when he has finished his week of intense study, he replaces one spell of the same level with the new spell he has learned. The caster chooses which spell to replace. Replacing a spell in the repertoire does not cause the character to lose the formula of the replaced spell.

###### Recovering from a Lost or Destroyed Spellbook

Sometimes, through bad fortune or enemy action, the spell book containing the formula for a studious caster’s repertoire might get lost or destroyed. If necessary, a studious caster can re-write the spell formulas from memory. It takes one day of dedicated activity per page to write down a spell formula from memory.

EXAMPLE: When Quintus finally confronts the vandal who captured him, he discovers the nasty fellow burned his spellbook to ash. After killing the vandal, Quintus sets out to re-create his spell book. The spell formulas for each of the four 1st level spells in his repertoire are one page each. The spell formulas for each of the three 2nd level spells in his repertoire are two pages each. Therefore it takes him (4 x 1) + (3 x 2) = 10 days to re-write his spell book. Since his spell book originally had 10 pages, this makes sense!

###### Study Requirement

To keep himself attuned to the power of magic, a studious caster must track the alignment of the celestial spheres, the astrological movements of the stars, the waxing and waning of the planets, and other factors of metaphysical importance. Each day, after he rests, a studious caster must spend at least one hour reviewing these factors. This study counts as an ancillary activity. A studious caster who misses more than one day of study in any seven days becomes **forgetful** when casting spells. Each time a forgetful castercasts a spell, he must roll 1d6. On a 1-2, the spell fails. The failed spell still counts against the number of spells he can cast per day. Forgetfulness ends as soon as the caster meets his daily study requirement. Undead in *torpor* (p. XX) never become forgetful, as no time passes for them.

In order to meet his daily study requirement, a studious caster must have the spell formula for each of the spells in his repertoire at hand. If the caster does not have physical access to one or more of the spell formulas, he becomes **forgetful** when casting those spells. To avoid becoming forgetful, a studious caster who adventurers away from home should be sure to bring a spell book containing the necessary formulas with him!

Poor or inexperienced studious casters often have just one small spell book, which they guard jealously. More established studious casters tend to own many spell books, with one or more “traveling” spell books containing the formulas for the spells in their repertoire, and the rest containing the formulas for spells not in their repertoire. These latter spellbooks can be consulted should the caster wish to change his repertoire (see below). Extra spell books are usually kept in a library, laboratory, or secure vault.

###### Reversed Spells

Studious spellcasters treat the normal and reversed version of a spell as separate spells.

### Inherited

Inherited magic is just that, inherited – the caster is born with the power to cast spells. Like studious spellcasters, inherited spellcasters have only a limited repertoire of spells, equal to the number and level of spells they can cast per day. The number of spells of each level in the repertoire is increased by the caster’s Charisma bonus. (At your discretion you can create inherited magic types that benefit from abilities other than Charisma.)

As inherited casters advance in level, they automatically learn new spells equal to the number and level of spells the caster can use in a single day. They do not need or benefit from masters, spellbooks, or scrolls, and are not beholden to any deity or higher power that limits their repertoire. Unlike studious spellcasters, they may not change spells in their repertoire.

EXAMPLE: The Faery magic type has an inherited spell repertoire. Faery casters have a spell repertoire equal to the number and level of spells they can cast per day, increased by their Charisma bonus.

###### Reversed Spells

Inherited spellcasters treat the normal and reversed version of a spell as separate spells.

## Magic Type Class Category

In order to use a new magic type in play, it will need to be incorporated into one or more custom character classes. As explained in the prior chapter*,* creating a custom class is a process of allocating **build points** to various **class categories** that define the strengths and weaknesses of the class. The Divine and Arcane magic types each have their own class category, and any new magic type must have its own class category value as well. When building a custom class, each class category is allocated between 0 and 4 build points. When more build points are allocated to the class category, more abilities from within that class category are available, and more XP are required to advance in level.

At each build point (1-4), the magic type’s spell progression and Base XP Cost is modified upward or downward. As such, different class categories can be more or less powerful and expensive depending on the underlying magic type’s Base XP Cost. For example, assigning 2 build points to the Divine value allows a character class to cast spells at the full power of the character’s actual level, at a cost of 500 XP. Assigning 2 build points to the Arcane value allows a character class to cast spells at about half the characters’ actual level, at a cost of 1,250 XP. This 500% variance is because the Arcane magic type has a Base XP Cost of 2,500 while the Divine magic type has a Base XP Cost of 500.

To determine the XP Cost and rate of spell progression at each build point, find the magic type’s Base XP Cost on the Class Category Value table below. Multiply the Base XP Cost by the XP Cost Multiplier at each level. Apply the effects noted on the Spell Progression column to the magic type’s spell progression (alternative, improved, or standard), as explained below.

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Class**  **Category**  **Value** | **2000+ Base XP Cost** | | **1,999 – 1,000 Base XP Cost** | | **999 – 500 Base XP Cost** | |
| **Spell Progression** | **XP Cost Multiplier** | **Spell Progression** | **XP Cost Multiplier** | **Spell Progression** | **XP Cost Multiplier** |
| 4 | 100% Power | x1 | 133% Power | x2 | 150% Power | x4 |
| 3 | 66% Power | x0.75 | 100% Power | x1 | 133% Power | x2 |
| 2 | 50% Power | x0.5 | 75% Power | x0.75 | 100% Power | x1 |
| 1 | 33% Power | x0.25 | 40% Level | x0.4 | 50% Power | 0.5 |
| 0 | None | 0 | None | 0 | None | 0 |

**33% Power:** The class has the ability to cast spells and engage in magic research (see below) with approximately 33% of the power of its class level according to its spell progression. The class uses its effective caster level for purposes of level-dependent spell ranges, duration, and damage. If the magic type is prayerful, its repertoire is decreased to 1/3 the normal allocation (rounded up).

**40% Power:** The class has the ability to cast spells and engage in magic research with approximately 40% of the power of its class level according to its spell progression. The class uses its effective caster level for purposes of level-dependent spell ranges, duration, and damage. If the magic type is prayerful, its repertoire is decreased to 1/3 the normal allocation (rounded up).

**50% Power:** The class has the ability to cast spells and engage in magic research with approximately 50% of the power of its class level according to its spell progression. The class uses its effective caster level for purposes of level-dependent spell ranges, duration, and damage If the magic type is prayerful, its repertoire is decreased to 1/2 the normal allocation (rounded up).

**66% Power:** The class has the ability to casts spells and engage in magical research with approximately 66% of the power of its class level according to its spell progression. The class uses its effective caster level for purposes of level-dependent spell ranges, durations, and damage. If the magic type is prayerful, its repertoire is decreased to 1/2 the normal allocation (rounded up).

**75% Power:** The class has the ability to cast spells and engage in magical research with approximately 75% of the power of its class level according to its spell progression. The class uses its effective caster level for purposes of level-dependent spell ranges, duration, and damage. If the magic type is prayerful, its repertoire is decreased to 3/4 the normal allocation (rounded up).

**100% Power:** The class has the ability to cast spells and engage in magical research at its class level according its spell progression.

**133% Power:** The class has the ability to cast spells and engage in magical research at its class level according to its spell progression. However, increase the class’s spells per level by 33%. Round fractions of .5 or greater up. The class uses its class level for all level-dependent spell ranges, durations, and damages; these are not increased by 33%. A class using the Alternative progression with Spells x 150% can cast one 1st level spell per day at 1st level. If the magic type is prayerful, its repertoire is increased by 20% above the normal allocation.

**150% Power:** The class has the ability to cast spells at its class level according to its spell progression. However, increase the class’s spells per level by 50%. Round fractions of .5 or greater up. The class uses its class level for all level-dependent spell ranges, durations, and damages; these are not increased by 50%. A class using the Alternative progression with Spells x 150% can cast one 1st level spell per day at 1st level. If the magic type is prayerful, its repertoire is increased by 50% above the normal allocation.

EXAMPLE: Below are three completed Class Category tables. The first table is for the Arcane magic type, the second table is for the Faery magic type, and the third table is for the Divine magic type.

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Class**  **Category**  **Value** | **Arcane (Base XP Cost 2,500)** | | **Faery (Base XP Cost 1,500)** | | **Divine (Base XP Cost 500)** | |
| **Spell**  **Progression** | **XP**  **Cost** | **Spell**  **Progression** | **XP**  **Cost** | **Spell**  **Progression** | **XP**  **Cost** |
| 4 | 100% Standard | 2,500 | 133% Alternative | 3,000 | 150% Standard | 2,000 |
| 3 | 66% Standard | 1,875 | 100% Alternative | 1,500 | 133% Standard | 1,000 |
| 2 | 50% Standard | 1,250 | 75% Alternative | 1,125 | 100% Standard | 500 |
| 1 | 33% Standard | 625 | 50% Alternative | 560 | 50% Standard | 250 |
| 0 | None | 0 | None | 0 | None | 0 |

###### Adding Class Powers

A class category can provide one or more class powers at some or all of its class category values. Each class power costs 75 XP. Add the cost of the class powers to the final XP cost of the class category at each class category value. A magic type class category can provide a maximum of one class power per point of class category value.

The specific class powers offered can be defined in advance for the class category, or left as “open slots” to be filled with class-specific powers.

EXAMPLE: The Judge decides he wants the Faery class category to offer a variety of class powers which can be used on a variety of spell-like abilities. He decides the class category will offer the maximum number of powers – 4 at class category value 4, 3 at class category value 3, 2 at class category value 2, and 1 at class category value 1. This raises the cost of the class category. Class category value 4 now costs [3,000 + (75 x 4)] 3,300 XP. Class category value 3 now costs [1,500 + (75 x 3)] 1,725 XP. Class category value 2 now costs [1,125 + (75 x 2)] 1,275 XP. Class category value 1 now costs (560 + 75) 635 XP.

## Codes of Behavior

The Divine magic type carries a restricted **code of behavior** that limits its casters’ choices and courses of action. Other types of casters may also carry codes of behavior. For prayerful magic types, the code of behavior generally comes for the magic type’s deity or religious order. For studious magic types, the code of behavior might arise from purification requirements, ascetic traditions, lifelong curses, taboos, or impositions arising from the study of magic. For inherited magic types, the code of behavior might be due to a madness or abnormality, a strange and unearthly longing, or a nature alien to normal mankind.

In exchange for accepting a code of behavior, a magic type gains special powers not otherwise available. The more build points assigned to the magic type’s class category when building the class, the more restrictive the behavior code will be, but the more benefits will be gained, as shown on the table below.

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Class**  **Category Value** | **Codes of Behavior** | |
| **Restriction** | **Benefit** |
| 4 | Extreme Code | 4 Class Powers or Rebuke Undead as Crusader of effective caster level |
| 3 | Monastic Code | 3 Class Powers or Rebuke Undead as Crusader of effective caster level |
| 2 | Clerical Code | 2 Class Powers or Rebuke Undead as Crusader of effective caster level |
| 1 | Chivalric Code | 1 Class Power or Rebuke Undead as Crusader of effective caster level |
| 0 | None | None |

**Class Category Value 1:** The class’s code will be similar to the commandments on a lay member of a religious faith, such as not to commit adultery, to follow minor dietary restrictions, and to engage in prayer on worship days, etc. A knight’s chivalric vows would also qualify.

**Class Category Value 2:** The code will add additional rules to an extent similar to that imposed on clergy, such as monogamy or celibacy, restrictions on dress, bans on certain indulgences, strict dietary rules, daily prayer, etc. The bladedancer, crusader, dwarven craftpriest, and shaman have such codes.

**Class Category Value 3:** The code will require a highly restrictive set of behaviors akin to those of a monastic order, including vows of chastity, obedience, and so on.

**Class Category Value 4:** The class’s code will be similar to that of the value below, but with an additional restriction such as pacifism, silence, or poverty. The priestess class has a class category 4 code.

As with the selection of the spell repertoire, the exact nature of the code of behavior should be left undetermined until specific custom classes are built for the magic type. Different classes within the same magic type may have different codes of behavior depending what value is assigned to the magic type’s category value.

A code of behavior need not demand virtue – a class’s code could dictate strange or vile behavior if appropriate to the class’s concept. For example, a cultist class devoted to chaotic powers might require ritual sacrifices, or use of strange drugs. You are the ultimate authority on the permissibility of any class’s code.

EXAMPLE: The Faery magic type represents otherworldly magic inspired by folklore and fairy tales. Therefore the Judge decides he wants the Faery class category to have a Code of Behavior which reflects superstitions and taboos that delimit its spellcaster’s behavior.

**Note:** There is an asymmetry between class power availability and rebuke undead. A crusader-like class with a code of behavior can gain the ability to rebuke undead at his class level with 2 build points, while a mage-like class with a code of behavior cannot gain the ability to rebuke undead at his class level until 4 build points; but the crusader-like class can only get 2 class powers for giving up rebuke undead while the mage-like class can get 4 class powers. The asymmetry makes it relatively more expensive (in terms of XP per level or class powers forsaken) for powerful casters to also be able to rebuke undead. The custom class rules in ***ACKS*** are designed to penalize classes that attempt to “do everything” and to prevent classes from being made that are better at core class abilities than the core classes are.

### Shaded Magic

In lieu of imposing a code of behavior, a magic type may be **shaded**. Shaded magic can be dangerous to a caster’s soul. Shaded magic types divide their spells into three categories, depending on how dangerous they are to cast.

* Spells which have an inherently corrupting influence on the soul are **black magic**.
* Spells which may or may not be corrupting, depending on the purposes to which they are used, are **grey magic**.
* Spells which are inherently safe to cast are called **white magic**.

###### Corruption

Shaded spellcasters acquire **corruption points** whenever they learn or cast a black magic spell, or cast grey magic spells for certain corrupt purposes:

* Each time a black magic spell is learned, the caster acquires a number of corruption points equal to the spell’s level.
* Each time a black magic spell is cast, the caster acquires one additional corruption point.
* Each time a grey magic spell is used in order to coerce, deceive, harm, or rob a Lawful or sapient Neutral target, the caster acquires one corruption point.

EXAMPLE: Baldur has come into possession of a Chaotic spellcaster’s spellbook. After several weeks of study, Baldur learns *tenebrosity* (a 1st level black magic spell)and *deathless minion*(a 2nd level black magic spell). He acquires 3 corruption points, 1 for learning *tenebrosity*and 2 for learning *deathless minion*.

When Baldur is caught with the Chaotic spellbook, men-at-arms from the local militia (Neutral men) are sent to arrest him for sorcery. Baldur casts *fan of flames* (a 2nd level grey magic spell) against his would-be captors, killing one guard and wounding two others. He gains 1 corruption point for casting grey magic to harm sapient Neutrals. Baldur then casts *deathless minion*to animate the slain guard, gaining another 1 corruption point for casting a black magic spell. After making his escape, Baldur has accumulated a total of 5 corruption points.

When a caster accumulates a number of corruption points equal to his Will score, his alignment shifts one step towards Chaotic. When a caster accumulates twice his Will score in corruption, his alignment shifts a second step towards Chaotic. Characters who begin Neutral are not affected by the first stage of corruption, and characters who begin Chaotic are not affected by the first two stages of corruption.

When a caster accumulates a number of corruption points equal to three times his Will score, and for each additional multiple of his Will score the caster accumulates in corruption points thereafter, he acquires a **corrupting weakness**. You will randomly determine or pick from the list below:

1. **Disfigured:** Sorcerous studies have begun to make the caster a monstrous figure, leaving him misshapen limbs, clawed hands or feet, hideous scarring, strangely colored eyes, and so on. Each disfigurement imposes a -2 reaction rolls with sapient creatures of Lawful or Neutral alignment.
2. **Distrusted**: Lore best left unstudied has twisted the caster’s demeanor and personality. A reaction roll with sapient creatures of Lawful or Neutral alignment can never achieve a friendly (12+) result. Each time this weakness is selected thereafter, reduce the best possible reaction roll by one further step.
3. **Enervated:** The caster’s exploration of sinister sorcery has sapped his soul of strength and vigor. His Constitution is reduced by 2 points each time this weakness occurs.
4. **Frightening to Beasts:** The caster’s corruption is unsettling to animals. They growl, hiss, rear up, and otherwise make their displeasure known whenever he is within 10’. The caster suffers a -4 reaction roll when encountering animals or giant animals. He cannot ride normal mounts. Characters with Beast Friendship proficiency can detect something is unnatural about the caster, but do not suffer a reaction roll penalty. If the caster himself had Beast Friendship proficiency, the proficiency’s effects now only help when dealing with wild predators and scavengers, such as wolves and vultures.
5. **Haunted:** Whispers from the beyond plague the caster. They are difficult to ignore, and impose a -2 penalty to listening throws and -1 penalty to initiative and surprise rolls. The penalty is cumulative each time this weakness occurs.
6. **Mad:** So disturbing are the caster’s dark secrets that he has begun to lose his grip on reality. Each day he must make a Spells saving throw or go mad for 1-10 hours. The caster’s first saving throw against madness is at +20, but each consecutive saving throw is one point less advantaged. When the caster goes mad, he falls under your control for 1d10 hours, during which time his behavior is entirely unpredictable. The day after a bout of madness, the caster resumes his saving throws with a +20 bonus.
7. **Mutation:** The corrupting influences of dark magic have begun to warp the caster’s body. The first time this weakness occurs, roll 1d10 on the Magical Mutations sub-table (***ACKS II****,* p. XX). The second time it occurs, roll 1d10+1. The third time it occurs, roll 1d10+2, and so on.
8. **Nocturnal:** Creatures of darkness and evil hunt by night, and sleep by day. So too does the caster. He cannot regain spells unless he sleeps during the day. Due to his nocturnal habits, he suffers a penalty of -2 to all throws when in sunlight. This penalty is increased by an additional 2 points each time this weakness occurs.
9. **Obsession:** The caster’s self-control and will begin to erode in the face of ongoing corruption. His Will is reduced by 2 points each time this weakness occurs. Note that this result may cause the caster to acquire more weaknesses by increasing the ratio of his corruption points to his Will!
10. **Sleepless:** Haunted by nightmares and disturbing visions of the grave, the caster finds it hard to sleep. Each time he attempts to rest, he must roll 1d6. On a 1, the caster tosses and turns all night, regaining no hit points and recovering no spells. The chance of sleeplessness increases by 1 each time this weakness occurs, to a maximum of five times.

The maximum number of weaknesses a caster may have is equal to the highest level spell he can cast. Such a caster is as depraved as he can be, given his knowledge; additional corruption cannot taint him further until he unlocks even darker secrets (e.g. learns higher level spells). He still accumulates corruption points, however.

EXAMPLE: Baldur is a 7th level Neutral mage with 11 Will. Over several months of studying a Chaotic spellbook, Baldur accumulates 11 corruption points. This is sufficient to cause Baldur’s alignment to shift one step, but because he is Neutral he ignores this first stage of corruption. On a dangerous adventure, he casts several black magic spells, and accumulates 22 corruption points. Baldur’s alignment now shifts another step, which he cannot ignore; he becomes Chaotic aligned.

With his new alignment, evil deeds come easier to him, and Baldur soon racks up more corruption. When accumulates 33 corruption points, Baldur acquires his first corrupting weakness. The Judge rolls a 1 on 1d10, indicating that Baldur is now **disfigured**. Because Baldur has been casting a lot of necromancy spells, the Judge decides that Baldur has taken on a corpse-like appearance, with pale yellowish skin, gaunt flesh, and reddish eyes. Baldur now suffers a -2 reaction roll with sapient Lawful and Neutral creatures.

The disfigured Baldur is now shunned by all good creature and sees little point in “playing nice” anymore. He soon accumulates many more corruption points. At 44, 55, and 66 corruption points, he accumulates his second, third, and fourth corrupting weakness. He becomes **nocturnal** (-2 penalty to throws in sunlight), **haunted** (-2 to hear noise, -1 initiative and surprise rolls), and **mutated** – with a roll of 8 on the Magical Mutation sub-table indicating he grows large fangs which prevent intelligible human speech (though not spells). At 8th level he accumulates 80 corruption points, but he cannot acquire more than four weaknesses, because the highest level spell he can cast is 4th. When Baldur reaches 9th level, and becomes capable of 5th level spells, he has acquired 103 corruption points. He immediately acquires his fifth weakness – another result of **nocturnal** means that he now suffers -4 penalty to throws in sunlight.

###### Identifying the Shade of Magic

Any magic type that uses the Shades of Magic must categorize its body of spells into black, grey, and white. To determine the shade of a spell, consult the checklists below. Always start with the black magic checklist, then proceed to the grey magic checklist, then to the white magic checklist.

The following types of spells should be considered black magic:

* Blast spells that deal necrotic damage.
* Death and necromancy spells of any sort, except those which exclusively harm the undead.
* Detection spells reversed to conceal black magic (e.g. *indiscernible curse*).
* Enchantment spells which are capable of bewitching, dominating, or enslaving sapient creatures for more than an hour. Having the power to enslave the will of sapient creatures for long periods of time is inherently corrupting.
* Enchantment spells which cause living creatures to falter or frighten, unless limited to target evil creatures. Causing fear and terror is an inherently black deed.
* Illusion spells which send phantasmal killers against the target. Causing fear and terror is, again, a black deed.
* Healing spells reversed to cause harm (e.g. *cause light injury* or *cause disease*). Perverting healing magic is always black.
* Protection spells reversed to operate against good creatures (e.g. *unholy circle*)or harm the target (*bane*).
* Summoning spells which communicate with or summon creatures from thin air (other planes of existence); or summoning spells which summon Lawful or sapient Neutral creatures which are compelled to serve the caster or any Chaotic creatures.
* Wall spells with necromantic components (e.g. *wall of corpse***s**).

The following types of spells should be considered grey magic:

* Blast spells of any type except those which deal necrotic damage (which are black) or those that deal luminous damage only to undead (which are white).
* Enchantment spells which are capable of bewitching, dominating, or enslaving sapient creatures, but not for more than an hour; and other enchantment spells which are not limited to targeting evil creatures.
* Illusion spells which render the target invisible or inaudible, or which can be disbelieved.
* Movement spells which can affect objects or unwilling targets.
* Transmogrification spells which can affect unwilling targets.
* Wall spells of any type except *walls of corpses*.

The following types of spells should be considered white magic:

* Blast and Death spells which exclusively harm the undead.
* Detection spells which are not black.
* Enchantment spells which are limited to targeting evil creatures.
* Healing spells, except if reversed to cause harm.
* Illusion spells which cannot be disbelieved, except for inaudibility and invisibility.
* Movement spells which can only affect willing targets.
* Protection spells, except if reversed to operate against “good” creatures or to harm the target.
* Transmogrification spells which can only affect objects or willing targets.
* Summoning spells in which the creature(s) summoned must arrive by means of their own locomotion from the nearest lair and are either sapient Lawful creatures which serve Lawful casters; or are unintelligent Neutral creatures.
* Any other spell which is not black or grey.

**Robert E. Howard Memorial Rule (Optional):** The taint on this type of magic is very strong. All of its grey magic spells are considered black magic. This magic type’s spellcasters gain 1 bonus class power per point of class category value.

**H.P. Lovecraft Memorial Rule (Optional):** The taint on this type of magic is so dark that there are no “pure” spells all. *All* of its spells are considered black magic. This magic type’s spellcasters gains 2 bonus class powers per point of class category value.

###### Shades of Magic and Places of Power

A shaded magic type is more affected by the places of power. Sinkholes of evil will enhance all black magic, not just death and necromancy magic. Pinnacles of good will enhance all white magic, not just healing and protection magic. Shaded casters can also accumulate corruption by spending time in sinkholes of evil and recover from corruption by spending time in pinnacles of good.

###### Warlock Class and Shaded Magic

The Warlock class from the ***ACKS II Revised Rulebook***uses a simplified version of shaded magic. He is assumed to automatically gain a corrupting weakness each time he advances in spellcasting ability. If desired, you can treat the warlock as a shaded caster, making him susceptible to alignment change but also possibly able to avoid corruption if he limits his spell selection. If built in this manner, the warlock would have one additional class power at 7th level.

## Magic Research

All types of magic offer their casters the ability to engage in magic research, but the exact abilities granted can vary widely between types. Magic research actually consists of nine different abilities: collecting and using divine power; researching spells; scribing scrolls; brewing potions; creating permanent magic items; casting ritual spells; creating and designing magical constructs; create magical crossbreeds; and granting unlife. Each of these abilities has an effective caster level requirement as well as other prerequisites, detailed below.

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Magic Research Ability** | **Caster Level** | **Other Prerequisites** |
| Collect/Use Divine Power | 1st | Code of Behavior |
| Research Spells | 5th | Prayerful or Studious Magic |
| Scribe Scrolls | 5th | Prayerful or Studious Magic |
| Brew Potions | 5th | Transmogrification modifier 1.25 or less |
| Create Permanent Magic Items | 9th | Enchantment modifier 1.5 or less |
| Cast Ritual Spells | 11th | None; Effects vary by Progression |
| Create and Design Constructs | 11th / 9th | Prayerful or Studious Magic / Any Dwarf |
| Create Crossbreeds | 11th | Transmogrification modifier 1 or less |
| Grant Unlife | 11th | Death modifier 1.5 or less |

**Collect and Use Divine Power:** This is the ability for the character to draw on the divine power of a higher being to further magical research. Divine power can be collected from congregants and/or from sacrifice (if Chaotic). Divine power is available at 1st level. However, in order to collect and use divine power, the class must have some strictures dictated by its faith or imposed by the being granting the power. As such, only classes with a Code of Behavior gain this ability. The Arcane magic type does not enforce a Code of Behavior on its spellcasters, so they are not afforded this ability.

EXAMPLE: The Judge has determined that Faery magic imposes a Code of Behavior. Therefore any classes built with the Faery class category offer the ability to collect and use divine power, presumably from the royal courts of the fey or perhaps the otherworldly realm of the faery itself.

**Research Spells:** This is the ability for the character to use spell research spells that he does not have access to from scrolls, spell books, or (if a prayerful spellcaster) his deity**.** This ability is gained at an effective caster level of 5. However, magic types with an inherited repertoire never offer this ability.

EXAMPLE: The Judge has determined that Faery magic is inherited, so classes built with the Faery class category never offer the ability to research spells.

**Scribe Scrolls:** This is the ability for the character to create scrolls inscribed with spells. This ability is gained at an effective caster level of 5. This ability can be gained at level 3 if the ability to Brew Potions is delayed until level 7. (This option is not available if the magic type is disqualified from brewing potion altogether.) As with researching spells, spellcasters with Inherited magic never gain this ability.

EXAMPLE: The Judge has determined that Faery magic is inherited, so classes built with the Faery class category never offer the ability to scribe scrolls.

**Brew Potions:** This is the ability for the character to brew single-use potions. This ability is gained at an effective caster level of 5. In order to offer this ability, the magic type must have a Transmogrification modifier of 1.25 or less. This ability can be gained at level 3 if the ability to scribe scrolls is delayed until level 7. (This option is not available if the magic type is disqualified from scribing scrolls altogether.)

EXAMPLE: Faery magic has a Transmogrification modifier of 1, so classes built with the Faery class category will offer the ability to brew potions ability at 5th level.

**Create Permanent Magic Items:** This is the ability for the character to make multi-charge and permanent magic items such as wands, rings, swords, and armor. This ability is gained at an effective caster level of 9. In order to offer this ability, the magic type must have an Enchantment modifier of 1.5 or less.

EXAMPLE: Faery magic has an Enchantment modifier of 1, so classes built with the Faery class category will offer the ability to create permanent magic items at 9th level.

**Cast Ritual Spells:** This is the ability for the character to learn and cast very powerful enchantments. This ability is gained at an effective caster level of 11. If the magic type follows the Standard or Improved progression, it will offer ritual spells of 7th, 8th, and 9th level. If the magic type follows the Alternative progression, it will offer ritual spells of 6th and 7th level.

EXAMPLE: Faery magic follows the Alternative progression. Therefore, classes built with the Faery class category will gain the ability to cast ritual spells of 6th and 7th level when they reach 11th level.

**Create and Design Constructs:** This is the ability for the character to craft magical constructs such as gargoyles and golems. This ability is gained at an effective caster level of 11, or 9if the character is a Dwarven class. In order to offer this ability to non-Dwarves, the magic type must have a Blast modifier of 1.5 or less. Thus, the Divine magic type, with a Blast modifier of 2.25, does not afford non-Dwarven casters the ability create cronstructs.

EXAMPLE: Faery magic has a Blast modifier of 2.25, so classes built with the Faery class category will never offer the ability to create and design constructs, unless they are Dwarven custom classes.

**Create Crossbreeds:** This is the ability for the character to magically blend different progenitor creatures together to create a crossbreed monster. This ability is gained at an effective caster level of 11. In order to offer this ability, the magic type must have a Transmogrification modifier of 1 or less. Thus, the Divine magic type, with a Transmogrification modifier of 1.25, does not afford its casters the ability create crossbreeds.

EXAMPLE: Faery magic has a Transmogrification modifier of 1, so classes built with the Faery class category will offer the ability to create crossbreeds ability at 11th level.

**Grant Unlife:** This is the ability for the character to transform creatures into intelligent undead through necromancy. This ability is gained at an effective caster level of 11. In order to offer this ability, the magic type must have a Death modifier of 1.5 or less. Granting unlife is limited to Chaotic spellcasters, but this is a limitation of alignment rather than magic type.

EXAMPLE: Faery magic has a Death modifier of 1.5, so classes built with the Faery class category will offer the ability to grant unlife ability at 11th level.

## Saving Throw Progression

In the custom class creation system, every class is assigned a saving throw progression based on its highest of the four class category values (Fighting, Thievery, Divine, or Arcane). The saving throw progression is critical, because it also determines the character’s magical item options, prime requisite, proficiencies, and hit points after 9th level.

Since these rules add the ability to create new class category values offering new magic types, it is entirely possible that character classes might have saving throw progressions that don’t exist yet. For instance, at what rate does a class with Faery 3, Fighting 1 advance in saving throws? How many hit points does it receive after 9th level? What magic items can it use? These rules explain how to create a unique saving throw progression for newly-created class categories.

###### Progression Rate

The class category of a new magic type will have a saving throw progression rate such as “2 points every 6 levels”. This rate is determined by its source factor total, its repertoire acquisition method, and its code of behavior.

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Source Factor Total** | **Inherited or Studious,**  **No Code of Behavior** | **Inherited or Studious,**  **With Code of Behavior** | **Any Prayerful** |
| 12.5 or less | 2 points every 6 levels | 2 points every 6 levels | 2 points every 4 levels |
| 12.6 – 13.5 | 2 points every 6 levels | 2 points every 4 levels | 2 points every 4 levels |
| 13.6 or more | 2 points every 4 levels | 2 points every 4 levels | 2 points every 4 levels |

EXAMPLE: Faery magic is inherited, imposes a code of behavior, and has a source factor total of 12.75. Classes with the Faery saving throwing progression will improve their saving throws by 2 points every 4 levels (like a crusader).

The saving throw progression rate also determines proficiency acquisition; characters choose one additional proficiency chosen from their class list each time they complete a full (2-point) saving throw progression.

EXAMPLE: Classes with the Faery saving throw progression will gain one class proficiency at 4th, 8th, and 12th level.

###### Magic Item Usage

The magic items available to classes with the new saving throw progression are determined by cross-referencing its repertoire acquisition method with the quotient of its Blast modifier / Healing modifier on the table below. If a choice of two magic item selections is available, the choice should be made by class, not by class category.

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Source Factor Total** | **Blast modifier / Healing modifier** | | |
| *0.67 – 1.10* | *1.10 – 1.50* | *1.6 – 2.25* |
| 12.5 or less | Arcane | Arcane and Divine | Arcane or Divine |
| 12.6 – 13.5 | Arcane or Divine | Arcane and Divine | Arcane or Divine |
| 13.6 or more | Arcane or Divine | Arcane and Divine | Divine |

EXAMPLE: Faery magic has a source factor total of 12.75. It has a Blast modifier of 2.25 and a Healing modifier of 1, which yields a quotient of 2.25. Therefore the class category can offer the ability to use either mage or crusader magic items. This choice is left open until specific custom classes are built for the magic type.

###### Prime Requisite

The prime requisite(s) of classes with the new saving throw progression are determined by cross-referencing its repertoire acquisition method with the quotient of its Blast modifier / Healing modifier on the table below. If a choice of two prime requisites is available, the choice should be made by class, not by class category.

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Repertoire** | **Blast modifier / Healing modifier** | | |
| *0.67 – 1.10* | *1.10 – 1.50* | *1.6 – 2.25* |
| Prayerful | INT and WIL | INT or WIL | WIL |
| Studious | INT | INT or WIL | INT and WIL |
| Inherited | INT and CHA | CHA | CHA and WIL |

EXAMPLE: Faery magic is inherited. It has a Blast modifier of 2.25 and a Healing modifier of 1, which yields a quotient of 2.25. The prime requisites of classes with the Faery saving throw progression will therefore be CHA and WIL.

###### Hit Points after 9th Level

Any class category offering spellcasting will have a saving throw progression that grants 1 hit point per level after 9th.

###### Hit Points after 9th Level

After 8th level, the amount of experience required to advance no longer doubles. Instead, it increases by a flat amount each level. The amount required is based on the saving throw progression. Determine this amount based on the magic type’s source factor total:

* Source Factor total of 14 or more: Additional 100,000XP for each level after 8th.
* Source factor total 13.1 to 14: An additional 120,000XP for each level after 8th.
* Source factor total 13 or less: An additional 150,000XP for each level after 8th.

EXAMPLE: Faery magic has a source factor total of 12.75. Classes with the Faery saving throw progression will require an additional 150,000XP for each level of advancement after 8th.

## Spell List

The final stage of creating a new magic type is to create a spell list of 10 to 20 spells of each level for your new magic type. This spell list will serve as the basis from which studious and inherited casters of the new type learn spells, or from which prayerful caster classes select their repertoire. If the new magic type is Prayerful, you should create multiple spell lists, reflecting the varying spell selection offered by different deities and higher beings.

Spell lists can include new spells custom-created for your magic type and/or existing spells imported from the various Arcane and Divine spell lists. (For rules on creating custom spells, see XXX). Remember to apply the appropriate magic type’s source factors when building its spells.

When importing spells from the various Arcane and Divine spell lists, you will need to compare the source modifier applied to spells of its category based on its type (Arcane or Divine) with the source modifier for that category of spells applied by your new magic type. If your new magic type has the same source modifier for that category as magic type from which you’re importing it, no modification is required. However, if your new magic type has a different source modifier, you’ll need to increase or decrease the spell’s level accordingly.

# Chapter 16: Custom Rules

The following rules cover a variety of circumstances that might arise when you run a session or campaign of ***ACKS****.*

## Characters

### Character Creation

Depending on your preferences, you can use either or both of the following optional rules for character generation.

#### Generating Characters without Templates (Optional)

Instead of rolling 3d6 to determine a template, the players roll 3d6 x 10 to determine their character’s starting gold pieces. They then use that the gold to select any weapons, armor, and equipment that you say is available. Afterwards, they select their starting proficiencies and (if a caster) starting spells, subject to your discretion. This rule substantially increases the time required to create a character, and is only recommended if your campaign has experienced players.

#### Generating Multiple Characters

At the start of play, each player generates two, three, four, or five characters. The player selects one of the characters as his player character. The remaining characters can be reserved as back-up characters or given to you to use as NPCs to populate the campaign setting. This approach ensures that the player always has a variety of characters to choose from to find one he likes, and gives you some additional NPCs to populate the world.

### Generating Attributes

You can customize the attribute generation methods used in your campaign so that player characters begin with better or worse attributes. Any of these rules can be combined with the optional rules for Generating Multiple Characters or for Adjusting Attributes.

#### Generating Gritty Characters

The players roll 3d6 for each attribute. Use this option if you want adventurers to be drawn almost randomly from the population, no more or less gifted than the average person. If an adventurer with gritty attributes become great, it will be because of their achievements in play, not because of special advantages during character generation.

#### Generating Heroic Characters

The players roll 4d6 for each attribute, drop the lowest die, tally the remaining dice, and record that result. Heroic characters will have attributes in approximately the same range as the top 20% of normal characters (11-14, averaging 12.24). Use this option if you want the adventurers to be a cut above the norm.

#### Generating Legendary Characters

The players roll 5d6 for each attribute, drop the lowest 2 dice, tally the remaining dice, and record that result. Legendary characters will have attributes in approximately the same range as the top 20% of heroic characters (12-16, averaging 13.43), or top 5% of normal characters. Use this option if you want your adventurers to be men and women of extraordinary gifts – protagonists such as Achilles, Aeneas, Aragorn, Beowulf, Conan, Elric, and Red Sonja are gifted with might, confidence, and power far beyond the norm

### Modifying Attributes

You can permit the players to adjust their attributes after they’ve been rolled by adopting one or more of these custom rolls. Any of these rules can be combined with the optional rules for Generating Multiple Characters and Generating Attributes.

#### Add Bonus Dice

After rolling for attributes, the player rolls an additional 3d6. These dice are then added, on a die by die basis, to the player’s choice of attribute. The player can add 1, 2, or even all 3 dice to an attribute. However, attributes remain capped at 18, and any points in excess of 18 are lost.

EXAMPLE: Jonathan rolls STR 10, INT 13, WIL 6, DEX 10, CON 9, CHA 7. The Judge is using the “add bonus dice” optional rule, so Jonathan now rolls 3d6. He gets 5, 5, 4. Jonathan has his heart set on playing a crusader, so he decides to add both 5s to Will. He could add the 4 to Will, but since he’d be capped at 18, the extra 2 points would be lost. Instead he adds the 4 to Charisma, for a final score of 11. Jonathan’s character now has STR 10, INT 13, WIL 16, DEX 10, CON 9, Cha 11.

#### Ordering Attributes as Desired

After rolling for attributes, the players can re-assign them in any order he desires. This rule affords the player more of an opportunity to optimize his character. Conversely, it tends to reduce the appearance of “off-archetype” characters such as smart fighters or burly thieves.

EXAMPLE: Jonathan rolls STR 10, INT 13, WIL 6, DEX 10, CON 9, CHA 7. The Judge is using the “ordering attributes as desired” optional rule, so Jonathan can re-assign them however he’d like. Jonathan has his heart set on playing a crusader, so he decides to re-order his attributes to be STR 10, INT 10, WIL 13, DEX 6, CON 9, CHA 7.

#### Trading Off Attributes

Once a player has selected his character class, he can raise the class’s key attribute or abilities if desired by sacrificing points in other abilities. 2 attribute points can be sacrificed from an attribute to raise a key attribute 1 point. This can be done more than once, but no attribute can be lowered below 9, and no attribute can be lowered if it is also a key attribute for the class, even if there are a few points to spare above the minimum required.

EXAMPLE: Jonathan has rolled up a crusader with STR 10, NT 13, WIL 16, DEX 10, CON 9, CHA 11. The Judge is using the “trading off attributes” optional rule, so Jonathan can sacrifice some points from his attributes in order to raise his key attribute (Will). He reduces his CHA from 11 to 9 to raise his WIL from 16 to 17. He reduces his INT from 13 to 11 to raise his WIL from 17 to 18. He cannot reduce his STR or CON because he cannot reduce attributes below 9. He cannot raise any attributes other than WIL, because that’s his only key attribute.

#### How Special are the Player Characters?

Knowing that average person has their attributes generated with 3d6 in order, we can estimate how “special” player characters are by cross-indexing the number of characters a player gets to create and pick from with the method of attribute generation used to create those characters.

|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Attribute Generation** | **1 character** | **2 characters** | **3 characters** | **4 characters** | **5 characters** |
| **Default** | 1 in 6 (17%) | 1 in 12 (8%) | 1 in 20 (5%) | 1 in 30 (3.3%) | 1 in 40 (2.5%) |
| **Gritty** | 1 in 2 (50%) | 1 in 3 (33%) | 1 in 4 (25%) | 1 in 5 (20%) | 1 in 6 (17%) |
| **Heroic** | 1 in 8 (12.5%) | 1 in 25 (4%) | 1 in 50 (2%) | 1 in 75 (1.3%) | 1 in 100 (1%) |
| **Legendary** | 1 in 65 (1.5%) | 1 in 300 (0.33%) | 1 in 750 (0.13%) | 1 in 1250 (%.08%) | 1 in 2000 (.05%) |

**Designer’s Note:** If you want your players to have characters whose degree of remarkability closely parallels that found in the Demographics of Heroism (p. XX) then have them generate 3 characters using the default attribute generation method and pick the one they prefer. You can then optionally permit trading off attributes.

### Determining Hit Points

At your discretion, any of the following optional rules can be used to make characters hardier. You can even apply different rules for different classes if desired. For instance, if he wants to encourage players to roll up human characters, he could allow all human classes to start with maximum hit points, but not demi-human classes.

#### Blessed by the Gods (Optional)

Do not roll for your character’s hit points at 1st level. Instead, give your character the maximum hit points he could have rolled, e.g. 8 for fighters, 6 for crusaders, and 4 for mages and thieves, modified by his Constitution.

#### Cursed by the Gods (Optional)

Roll your character’s hit points with one Hit Die. Do not apply any minimums. If you roll a 1, well, good luck.

#### From Ordinary to Extraordinary (Optional)

Before he become an adventurer, your character was just an ordinary 0th-level member of his race. Roll 1d6 hit points to determine his hit points at 0th level. When your character earned his 1st level of experience (prior to play), he might have gained more hit points. Roll the appropriate Hit Die for your class. If the result of the roll is greater than your 0th level hit points, record the new roll. If the roll is less than or equal to your 0th level hit points, you begin play with your 0th level hit points +1.

EXAMPLE: Zach has rolled up Norden, a 1st level dwarven vaultguard. Before Norden became a 1st level dwarven vaultguard, he was just an ordinary 0th-level dwarf. To find out how many hit points he had at that level, Zach rolls 1d6. The result is a 4. Zach now rolls 1d8 for Norden’s hit points at first level. If the result is 1, 2, 3, or 4, Norden starts with his 0th level hit points +1, or 5 hit points. If the result is 5 or more, Norden starts with hit points equal to the result.

### Advanced Characters

Because of the many options that ***ACKS***offers for high-level play, some Judges may wish to begin their campaigns with the player characters already at an advanced level of experience. The following guidelines are suggested for campaigns where the players begin the game with **advanced characters**.

#### Tiers

Advanced characters may begin as adventurers (4th-6th level characters); conquerors (7th-10th level characters); or kings (11th or higher level characters). Adventurer tier is suitable for action and exploration oriented campaigns with experienced players who don’t need to learn the game by starting at 1st level. Conqueror tier is appropriate for campaigns focused on establishing and expanding new domains. King tier is appropriate for campaigns where the characters manage vast realms and fight wars.

#### Attributes and Hit Points

To generate attributes, use the standard method described in the ***ACKS II Revised Rulebook*.** For adventurers generate three sets of attributes; for conquerors, generate four sets; For kings, five sets. After generating attribute sets pick the best one for the character.

#### Starting Experience Points

All advanced characters in the campaign begin with a fixed number of experience points, applied to whichever class they choose. Adventurers begin with 20,000XP. This will put elven spellswords at 4th level, thieves at 6th level, and most other characters at 5th level.

Conquerors begin with 310,00XP. This will put elven spellswords at 8th level, crusaders and thieves at 10th level and most other classes at 9th level.

Kings begin with 620,000XP. Most racial character classes will be at or near maximum level. Mages will be 11th level, crusaders and thieves will be 13th level, and most other classes will be 12th level.

#### Class and Level

Advanced characters can choose any class they qualify for. They begin at a level determined by their starting experience points. Advanced characters get maximum hit points for their first level and roll normally for their remaining Hit Dice.

#### Proficiencies and Spells Repertoire

All advanced characters begin play knowing any proficiencies they qualify for based on their class, level, and Intellect score.

Mages, warlocks, witches, dwarven craftpriests, elven nightblades, and elven spellswords, Nobiran wonderworkers, and Zaharan ruinguards begin play with the maximum number of spells in their repertoire. Adventurers should roll randomly to determine which spells are in their repertoire. Conquerors may choose half the spells and roll randomly for the remainder. Kings may choose which spells are in their repertoire.

#### Starting Wealth

All advanced characters begin with a fixed amount of starting wealth. Adventurers begin with 20,000gp. Conquerors begin with 350,000gp. Kings begin with 4,500,000gp. Starting wealth can be spent to:

* Purchase equipment, such as weapons, armor, vessels, mounts, etc;
* Establish libraries, workshops, laboratories, or mortuaries;
* Purchase spell formulas, magic item formulas, or special components;
* Build castles, hideouts, sanctums, or other strongholds;
* Purchase merchandise at its base price;
* Purchase constructs, crossbreed, or undead minions, as described below;
* Recruit hirelings, as described below.

Any remaining starting wealth can be converted into coin, gems, or jewels, as desired. Starting wealth cannot be used to buy magic items.

###### Purchasing Minions

Advanced characters who are able to build constructs, crossbreed monsters, or animate undead minions can expend gp to begin play with one or more minions. (If using ***By This Axe****,* a dwarven machinist could start with automatons.) Each minion costs 4,000gp per Hit Die plus an additional 1,250gp per minor special ability and 10,000gp per major special ability.

If the minion is a never-before-seen construct, the cost is doubled as the character will have had to both design and build it. If the minion is a crossbreed, the character must purchase (at the cost listed in the ***Monstrous Manual***for an untrained adult) one of each creature used in the crossbreeding. These creatures were consumed in the crossbreeding.

The advanced character must have a workshop, laboratory, or mortuary sufficient to create the minion.

###### Recruiting Hirelings

Advanced characters can begin with hirelings, including henchmen, specialists, and mercenaries.

The advanced character can have as many henchmen as desired, subject to the limits of their Charisma score. The henchman can be of any desired class or level, but the advanced character must spend gp equal to the henchman’s experience points. The henchman’s equipment and magic items must be provided by the advanced character.

Advanced characters can also begin play with specialists and mercenaries in his employ. For each specialist or mercenary, the advanced character must spend gp equal to six month’s wages for the hirelings. This represents past costs incurred in having the hireling on retainer.

#### Magic Items

Advanced characters will begin with one or more magic items. The actual magic items can be randomly determined or chosen by you. Re-roll cursed items. Characters capable of magic research may substitute magic item formulas for actual magic items at a 4:1 ratio. For instance, one common item could be traded in for the formula to create 4 common items.

|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Magic Items for Advanced Characters** | | | | | |
| **Character**  **Tier** | **Common**  **(500gp)** | **Uncommon**  **(2,500gp)** | **Rare**  **(12,500gp)** | **Very Rare**  **(60,000gp)** | **Legendary**  **(300,000gp)** |
| Adventurer | 2 | 1 | - | - | - |
| Conqueror | 5 | 3 | 2 | 50% | - |
| King | 10 | 10 | 9 | 5 | 1 |

#### Domains

Conqueror tier characters that use their starting wealth to build a stronghold begin play with a domain. Create the domain as if the character’s stronghold had just been completed, rolling for starting land value, peasant families, and followers (if of 9th level or above). If the character builds a hideout, his syndicate will have the standard number of followers for his class and level. If the character builds a sanctum, he will have the standard number of apprentices and normal men for his class and level. Any dungeons built by conqueror level characters begin empty.

The character can then use his starting wealth to improve their domain.

* He can make agricultural investments, attracting 1d10 peasant families per 1,000gp;
* Improve the land value of a hex by 1gp per 25,000gp spent;
* Found an urban settlement by expending 10,000gp and moving at least 75 families to the settlement;
* Make urban investments, attracting 1d10 urban families per 1,000gp spent.

King tier characters that use their starting wealth to build a stronghold will begin play with a realm. The realm will include the king’s personal domain and several vassal realms. The king tier character’s realm will include a number of vassal realms equal to the character’s actual number of henchmen. Create the king’s personal domain as above. Then each vassal realm will have one-fourth the number of peasant and urban families that the character’s domain has. The king must pay the cost of the strongholds necessary to secure his domain and each of the vassal domains.

King tier thieves, assassins, and elven nightblades who build a hideouts begin with a syndicate of the maximum size permitted for their location and hideout. If they have thief, assassin, or nightblade henchmen of 9th level or higher, they can build hideouts for these henchman and establish a criminal guild. Syndicates within the guild will have 2d6 members each. King tier mages and warlocks who build a sanctum begin with 6 3rd level mage apprentices and 12 normal men. If they build a dungeon, it should be populated until full.

You can determine the starting location of any strongholds, domains, and realms, or allow the characters to select locations on the regional map. The territory controlled by the domain will be a number of hexes necessary to fit the population, subject to the maximum number of hexes that the stronghold can secure.

Domain rulers begin play with troops sufficient to meet their garrison expense. Additional troops must be purchased as hirelings, spending 6 times their wages from their budget.

#### Multi-Tier Play

If you wish to embrace every facet of the *Adventurer Conqueror King System* at once, you can allow the players to act at all tiers simultaneously. In such a campaign, each player has one king tier character – a powerful archmage, mighty warlord, or similar persona. Each king in turn has one or more henchmen at the conqueror tier of play. These conqueror tier characters in turn have adventurer tier characters as their own henchmen. In such a campaign, the players will be simultaneously running one or more kingdoms, ruling the duchies and baronies in the kingdoms, and playing the adventuring parties that assist these rulers in dealing with the local threats of monsters and chaotic forces. Depending on the group’s preferences, each session they can focus on a different tier of play, or they can shift between tiers within one game session.

#### Patron Play

Another possible approach to using advanced characters, often called **patron play** is to divide the players by tier. In patron play, some of the players control **patrons** (king or conqueror tier characters) while the rest control adventurers, possibly adventurers in different parties if the number of players is large enough to support that.

The patrons take the place of the NPC rulers that would otherwise inhabit your setting, transferring control of their course of action from you to various players. You then use the rules for campaign activities, strongholds, armies, and other backend mechanics to determine the scope and effect of the patron player’s decisions.

Patron play typically requires your campaign to adopt a fixed time increment, such that during each day of real-world time, a fixed number of days of game time will pass. The most common interval is 1:1, such that each actual day correlates to a game day, but ratios of 1:7, 1:28, or 7:28 might work.

EXAMPLE: The Judge has assembled a group of 30 players who wish to participate in an online patron play campaign. To 10 of the players, he assigns the role of patron, with 2 king tier patrons and 8 conqueror tier patrons (4 under each king). To the other 20 players, he assigns the role of adventurer, initially dividing them up into 4 parties of 5 PCs. He decides that the campaign will run on 7:28 time, such that when a week passes in the real world, a month passes in the game world. The patrons will then undertake weekly turns that cover a month of campaign activities, while the adventurers will each have one weekly session in which they can undertake up to 28 days of adventuring or campaign activities.

Some groups pursue patron play to its logical endpoint, with the patrons being assigned Judge-like powers over their realm or territory. This sort of patron play resembles the playstyles of the earliest days of D&D, when Gary Gygax was running a session every day and had co-DMs to assist him.

## Combat

These rules enable you to customize the combat mechanics of ***ACKS II***to your taste. Depending on your preferences, you can differentiate between attacking and armor penetration, add critical hits, or simplify initiative.

### Attacks and Armor Penetration of Large Monsters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Size Category** | **Attack Throw Penalty** | **Armor Penetration** |
| Man-sized (399 lbs or less) | 0 | 0 |
| Large (400 – 1,999 lbs) | -2 | 2 |
| Huge (2,000 – 7,999 lbs) | -4 | 4 |
| Gigantic (4 – 15 tons) | -6 | 6 |
| Colossal (16 – 31 tons) | -8 | 8 |
| Colossal (32 – 63 tons) | -10 | 10 |
| Colossal (64 tons or more) | -12 | 12 |

All monsters larger than men suffer an **attack throw penalty** based on their size category. This penalty applies to all attacks by the monster. In exchange, the monster gains a commensurate amount of **armor penetration**. Armor penetration allows a monster to ignore a number of points of the target’s Armor Class from armor, shields, magical adjustments to armor and shields, Weapon & Shield proficiency, magical items "of armor", and spells that create magical armor or shields or render the subject invulnerable. However, armor penetration cannot ignore Armor Class from DEX, Graceful Fighting ability, Swashbuckling proficiency, magical items and spells "of protection", and spells that improve AC through luck, speed, or divine favor.

In most cases, a monster will be attacking a foe with more armor than its armor penetration, and the attack throw penalty and armor penetration will cancel each other out. However, when a target is wearing less armor than the monster’s armor penetration, it will have a relatively harder time hitting the target. This is much to the benefit of heroic fantasy archetypes such as barbarians in loincloths, bladedancers in chainmail bikinis, and thieves in leather armor.

EXAMPLE: An ogre, a large creature with an attack throw of 6+, is fighting a fighter and a thief. In the first round, it attacks the fighter. The fighter is wearing plate armor (AC 6). The ogre suffers a -2 penalty to its attack throw, but it ignores 2 points of armor. Its target value to hit the fighter is (6+2+6-2) 12+. In the second round, the ogre attacks the thief. The thief is wearing no armor but has DEX 18, so he has AC 3. The ogre suffers a -2 penalty to its attack throw because of its size. It could ignore 2 points of armor, but the thief is not wearing any. The ogre’s target value to hit the thief is (6+2+3) 11+.

Note that if this rule were not applied, the ogre’s target value to hit the fighter would still be (6+6) 12+, but the ogre’s target value to hit the thief would only be (6+3) 9+. Nimble, lightly armored characters benefit from this rule.

**Note:** Since it alters a core mechanic of ***ACKS****,* the Attacks and Armor Penetration of Large Monsters rule deserves a bit of explanation. In ***ACKS*** and other D20-based fantasy RPGs, armor protects its wearer by making him harder to successfully attack. This rule is much-maligned, largely by those who believe armor “shouldn’t make you harder to hit”. But historically, that’s just what armor did. Armor *worked*. In a careful survey, *From Sumer to Ancient Rome* reviewed the weapons available to ancient warriors and found they could generate 70-100 joules of kinetic energy, while to penetrate 2mm of bronze on leather took in excess of 120+ joules! Nor would “bludgeon force still kill"—even a mighty 110-joule blow from a mace would have its kinetic energy distributed by the armor, such that it is reduced to the equivalent of a 15-joule blow. In other words, attacks that struck armor often bounced off with little harm done; successful attacks were those that struck gaps in the armor. ***ACKS***’sArmor Class is a reasonable and playable approximation of this reality.

What about when the combatants are not humans producing 70-100 joules, but instead are elephants, ogres, dragons, or other monsters capable of delivering far more kinetic energy? In ***ACKS****,* bigger monsters have higher Hit Dice; and monsters with higher Hit Dice have better attack throws. An ogre, with 4 HD, has an attack throw of 6+; it strikes a knight in chainmail (AC 4) as easily as a 1st level fighter (attack throw 10+) strikes an unarmored foe (AC 0). Since an ogre and a fighter probably have similar dexterity and combat training, the difference in accuracy obviously reflects the ogre’s much greater strength. An ogre can cleave through chainmail like a child snapping twigs, so the target is effectively “unarmored” against its blows. Conversely, since a fighter’s blows will be stopped by chainmail, he needs to aim for the neck, armpits, thighs, and other unarmored areas, and thus has a harder time hitting. Armor Class remains a reasonable and playable approximation of the reality of the game world.

Or does it? After all, the same ogre attacking an unarmored target (AC 0) will hit the unarmored target on a 6+ to the fighter’s 10+. In this case, it can’t be that the ogre’s strength is allowing it to cleave through armor – the target isn’t wearing any! Thus, we have a conundrum: Confront an ogre with an armored knight and his fighting skills seem to rely on brute force to bash through armor. Put an ogre against a target with no armor, and the ogre suddenly becomes a graceful ballerina of death.

### Critical Hits

If the result of an attacker’s attack throw exceeds its target value by 10 or more, the attacker has dealt a **critical hit** to its target. When a critical hit is dealt, the target suffers double damage dice and must make an immediate size-adjusted Paralysis saving throw. If the save fails, the target suffers a critical effect in addition to double damage dice.

The attacker determines the critical effect dealt by rolling 1d10 on the appropriate column on the Critical Effects table. For purposes of the Critical Effects table, “characters” are combatants equipped with arms and armor, while “monsters” are combatants relying on natural weapons and toughness.

**Brawling:** After seeing the result rolled on the Critical Effects table, the attacker can opt to inflict a Brawling critical effect in lieu of the effect rolled. For instance, an attacker who fears being carried off by a flying creature could substitute a Brawling result for a Clamber result.

**Combat Trickery:** After seeing the result rolled on the Critical Effects table, an attacker with Combat Trickery proficiency can substitute the special maneuver with which he has proficiency in lieu of the effect rolled. For instance, an attacker with Combat Trickery (Disarm) who deals a Force Back critical hit can inflict a Disarm instead.

**Shields May Be Splintered:** If the target of a critical effect is equipped with a shield, he may choose to substitute a Damage Shield result in lieu of a Damage Armor, Force Back, Injure Hide, Impair Attack, Impair Move, Knockdown, or Stun effect dealt to him. This represents the character desperately absorbing the blow on his shield.

###### Critical Effects

**Attacker’s Choice:** The attacker may choose any desired critical effect from the appropriate column (Character or Monster).

**Brawling:** The target suffers an additional 1d4 mundane bludgeoning damage from a strike from the attacker’s gauntlet, pommel, or shield rim. If the attacker has no metal weapons, the damage is nonlethal, but otherwise the brawling damage can be lethal or nonlethal, at his discretion.

**Damage Armor:** The target’s armor is damaged, reducing its effectiveness by 1 point. Armor that loses all effectiveness is ruined. Damaged armor can be repaired at a cost of 10gp per point of effectiveness. Magic armor cannot be damaged except by mundane damage.

**Damage Shield:** The target’s shield is damaged, reducing its effectiveness by 1. If the shield is non-magical, this will destroy it. Damaged shields can be repaired at a cost of 10gp per point of effectiveness. Magic shields cannot be damaged by mundane damage.

**Disarm:** The target is disarmed of its weapon (as the special maneuver). The weapon drops to a point chosen by the attacker who dealt the critical hit, up to 5’ distant from the target.

**Fatigued:** The target is **fatigued** by the flurry of blows. The target suffers a -1 penalty to attack throws and damage throws until it gets 8 hours of restful sleep. If additional fatigue effects are rolled, the effects are cumulative.

**Force Back: T**he target is forced back (as the special number). It must withdraw a number of feet equal to the attacker’s damage roll. If this would push the opponent into a wall or obstacle, the opponent is knocked down, and takes 1d6 points of damage per 10’ he has traveled.

**Knockdown:** The target is immediately knocked **prone** (as the special maneuver).

**Impair Attack:** One of the target’s natural attacks (determined randomly) is somehow impaired – muscles sprained, claws ripped, etc. The target suffers a -4 to attack throws with the impaired natural attack until it gets 8 hours of restful sleep.

**Impair Move:** The target’s speed is reduced by 25% or 30’ (whichever is less) until the target rests. This represents a leg being wrenched, an ankle twisted, and so on.

**Injure Hide:** The target’s hide is bruised, cut, or broken open such that its AC is reduced by 1 until it gets 8 hours of restful sleep.

**Stun:** The target is stunned by the blow and considered **surprised** until the end of its next initiative.

**Sunder Weapon:** The target’s weapon is sundered (as the special maneuver). If the target’s weapon is a non-magical spear, staff, or pole arm, it shatters into splinters when sundered, dealing an additional 1d4 nonlethal damage to the target. Swords cannot be sundered by non-metal weapons or natural attacks dealing mundane damage. Magic weapons cannot be sundered except by other magic weapons or natural attacks dealing extraordinary damage.

**Wrestle/Clamber:** The results of this critical effect depend on the difference in size between the attacker and target. If the target is the same size category or smaller than the attacker, the attacker has grabbed the target in a wrestling hold (as the special maneuver). If the target is one or more size categories larger than the attacker, the attacker has clambered on top of or mounted the target (as the special maneuver, see below).

### Exploding 20s

This rule is designed to be used in conjunction with the Critical Hits rules above. When making throws, unmodified 20s do *not* automatically succeed. Instead, when a character who throws an unmodified (natural) 20, the d20 **explodes**: Thecharacter immediately rolls another 1d20 and adds the new result to 20. Subsequent rolls of 20 continue to explode without limit.

EXAMPLE: A peasant archer with a base attack throw of 11+ fires an arrow at Marcus, a high-level fighter in magical armor with an AC of 15. The archer needs to throw an (11+15) 26+ to hit the fighter. He rolls a natural 20. He immediately rolls 1d20; the result is a 7. The peasant has therefore rolled a (20 + 7) 27 against Marcus, which is a hit. Had the peasant’s second d20 roll have been a 3, the peasant’s result would have been a (20 + 3) 23, and he’d have missed. Had the peasant’s second d20 roll have been an 18, result would have been a (20 + 18) 38 and the peasant would have dealt a critical hit.

### Monster Group Initiative

Many ***ACKS***adventurers involve large-scale fights against dozens or sometimes even hundreds of combatants. In such cases, it makes little sense to roll initiative individually for the monsters, as their sheer numbers will mean that they roll every initiative result. Instead, you can roll initiative for each encounter group of monsters. The monsters still act sequentially on their count. (Remember, there is no simultaneous initiative in ***ACKS II****.*)

Encounter groups are detailed in the ***ACKS II******Monstrous Manual***, and represent the typical group of monsters that are encountered together. For instance, brigands organize into bands consisting of up to 10 gangs of 2d4 brigands each. Hyenas organize into packs of 1d4+1 each.

EXAMPLE: The Judge is running an adventurer in which he is using initiative by monster group. A party of adventurers, Andravus, Castinus, Hyglak, Raemon and Tirenius, has encountered three gangs of brigands. Gang #1 has 8 brigands, gang #2 has 4 brigands, and gang #3 has 6 brigands. When combat begins, the adventurers all roll initiative, while the Judge rolls initiative for each gang. Let’s imagine the initiative rolls were as follows:

8: Andravus

7: -

6: -

5: Gang #1, Raemon

4: Gang #2, Castinus

3: Hyglak

2: Tirenius

1: Gang #3

On initiative count 8, Andravus would take his initiative segment.

On initiative count 5, Raemon and all 8 members of Gang #1 can act. Since their initiative is tied, the side with the fewer combatants gets to act first. Therefore, Raemon gets to take his initiative segment first. Afterwards, each of the 8 members of Gang #1 get to take their initiative segments, one at a time in any order the Judge prefers.

On initiative count 4, the same process is followed, with Castinus taking his initiative segment followed by the 4 brigands of gang #2.

On initiative count 3, Hyglak takes his initiative segment.

On initiative count 2, Tirenius decides to delay his initiative segment until initiative count -1. (He’s waiting for all the brigands to cluster together in the melee so he can *fireball* them.)

On initiative count 1, Gang #3’s 6 members take their initiative segments in any order the Judge prefers.

On initiative count -1, Tirenius takes his initiative segment.

### Static Initiative

Initiative is rolled at the start of each combat round in ***ACKS***in order to simulate the chaos, confusion, and uncertainty of combat. Players can never be sure if their spell will go off before an enemy archer gets to fire, or whether a withdrawal or retreat will come too late, or whether an injured adventurer can be healed before he is struck down. However, some Judges prefer to de-emphasize such tactical detail in favor of speed of play. If that’s your preference, then you can use static initiative.

With static initiative, the combatants only roll initiative on the first round of combat. They then retain their initiative count for all subsequent rounds until combat ends or until they choose to voluntarily delay their initiative. If they voluntarily delay their initiative, their initiative count is reduced to the delayed value for the remainder of the combat. A combatant can delay multiple times if desired, subject the maximum delay (negative initiative count).

EXAMPLE: The Judge is not only using initiative by monster group, he is also using static initiative. Therefore, on the second round of combat, the initiative count would go as follows:

8: Andravus

7: -

6: -

5: Gang #1, Raemon

4: Gang #2, Castinus

3: Hyglak

2: -

1: Gang #3

0: -

-1: Tirenius

Because Tirenius delayed his initiative segment to -1 on the first round, he has reduced his initiative count to -1 for the rest of the battle.

Static initiative tends to make the outcome of combat more deterministic and predictable. If their first rolls go well, the players do not have to fear a shocking swing that suddenly seems them attack twice without an opportunity to respond. Conversely, if their first rolls go badly, they can find it impossible to recover.

A number of hybrid options can be used that retain some of the benefits of both dynamic and static initiative. Here are a few optional rules that we believe merit exploration by Judges who enjoy tinkering with mechanics:

* **The First and the Last:** Initiative is static each round for every combatant except the combatant who acted first and the combatant who acted last. Those combatants must re-roll initiative at the start of the next round.
* **The Tide Turns:** Initiative is static until a player character is reduced to 0 hp or otherwise removed from the combat. At this point, all combatants re-roll initiative.
* **Mysteries of Magic:** Initiative is static each round for every combatant, except for combatants who declare they are casting a spell. Combatants casting spells re-roll initiative, so they are uncertain when their spell will go off in the round.

### Simultaneous Initiative in Duels

When two combatants are **engaged** in a one-on-one duel with no other combatants, and both have the same initiative number, the two combatants act simultaneously. If this results in either or both combatants being reduced to 0 hp or less, then the combatant(s) immediately roll on the Permanent Wounds table at -5, applying only modifiers for Constitution, equipment, HD, and hp.

EXAMPLE: Valerian Bellësareus is engaged in a one-on-one duel with his brother, the ruinguard Suhgurim. After four rounds of combat Valerian is down to just 7 hp and Suhgurim is down to 8 hp. On the fifth round of combat, the two combatants both roll a 6 for initiative. Therefore, they act simultaneously. Valerian hits Suhgurim with his holy sword of fire for 14 luminous fire damage, reducing him to -6 hp. Suhgurim hits Valerian for 12 bludgeoning damage, reducing him to -5 hp. The two brothers both roll on the Permanent Wounds table. Both roll badly and are mortally wounded. Suhgurim has all his limbs are burned of and his face hideously scarred by the flames, while Valerian’s neck is broken when the Scourge of Law strikes his throat between helm and cuirass. Tragic!

## Encumbrance

The encumbrance rules in ***ACKS II***have three purposes. First, they limit the amount of supplies or treasure that adventurers can carry, creating logistical challenges. Second, they impose a realistic disadvantage on heavily-armored combatants, making them move slower than lightly-equipped skirmishers. Finally, they serve as a benchmark to assess the difficulty of certain tasks, such as squeezing through narrow chokepoints. What the rules do not do is closely model exactly how an adventurer carries his goods, instead relying on common sense. Unfortunately, in the absence of a hard rule, some players of a “gamist” mindset have been known to try to equip their characters in implausible ways. The following guidelines are intended to help you, the Judge, make rulings where necessary on such matters.

An adventurer can carry:

* Held in his hand, one item or weapon with an encumbrance of 1 st or less, or not more than 100 coins or gems.
* Hanging on his back, either a backpack or a shield *or* two of the following: quiver/case, rucksack, weapon (any size).
* Hanging from a backpack or rucksack, any four items or weapons each with an encumbrance of 1/6 st or less, excluding other backpacks, harnesses, or rucksacks.
* Hanging from an adventurer’s harness, any six items, sets of items, or weapons each with an encumbrance of 1/6 st or less, excluding backpacks, harnesses, rucksacks, or sacks. An adventurer’s harness cannot be worn over heavy armor.
* Hanging from a shoulder strap, any four items, sets of items, or weapons each with an encumbrance of 1/6 st or less, excluding backpacks, harnesses, rucksacks, or sacks.
* Hanging from a waist belt, any four items or weapons each with an encumbrance of 1/6 st or less, excluding backpacks, harnesses, rucksacks, or large sacks.
* Hidden in any coat sleeve or boot, a tiny weapon.
* Stored in a backpack, up to 4 st of equipment or treasure.
* Stored in a belt pouch, up to 3/6 st of equipment or treasure.
* Stored in in a large sack, up to 6 st of equipment or treasure.
* Stored in a small sack or rucksack, up to 2 st of equipment or treasure.
* Worn on his head, one piece of headwear such as a helmet, visor, hat, or cap.
* Worn on his body, up to two pieces of jewelry in each location (neck, wrist, finger, etc.). Adventurers with Streetwise proficiency can pull off one additional piece of jewelry per rank without seeming garish. Note that some magic items (such as rings) cease to function if worn in excess.

It is our fervent hope that no player ever forces you to break out these rules. If, however, Steve of the Sixtyfold Sacks does appear in your campaign, you now are equipped to deal with it (pardon the pun).

## Heroic Codes

In heroic fantasy settings, adventurers might hold to a code of behaviorknown as a **heroic code**. Adhering to such codes is a mark of greatness and increases the hero’s fame and glory in the eyes of his people. In game terms, a character who behaves according to a heroic code for the course of the entire adventure gains a **10% bonus on experience earned** during that adventure.

Each heroic code is made up of eight virtues to which the character should aspire. The exact virtues recommended by the heroic code will depend on the hero’s culture. Below we present one possible heroic code, the **warrior code** of the pagan heroes of myth.

### Warrior Code

* **Courage:** Do not show fear or flee in the face of an enemy of equal or inferior strength. Orderly retreat in the face of an enemy of superior strength is acceptable if the consequences of retreat will not put others in jeopardy.
* **Hospitality:** Do not turn away a supplicant at your door. Provide food and shelter to any guest who asks it, even a sworn enemy, and ensure they do not come to harm while hosted in your home.
* **Reliability:** Do not break a sworn oath or promise.
* **Honesty:** Do not lie to friends, family, or strangers. Deception may be employed in war, or to make a point against those who have proved themselves dishonest, but not if doing so would break an oath.
* **Generosity:** Do not be miserly in gifts or words. Be generous to friends, family, and followers. Reward the loyal service of followers with gifts and praise.
* **Loyalty:** Do not allow others to harm your family, your friends, or your followers. If harmed, demand compensation for the harm from the wrongdoers. If compensation is not granted, take revenge for the harm against the wrongdoers.
* **Honor:** Do not allow others to accuse you of breaking the warrior code, nor give them cause to believe you would.
* **Ceremoniousness:** Uphold the traditions, law, and order of your or your lord’s realm.

The virtues within a code are always listed in order of importance. When contradictions arise in the heroic code, higher-order virtues generally take precedence over lower-order virtues. (By re-ordering the eight virtues, very different codes of behavior can be created.)

EXAMPLE: Sigwulf has sworn an oath to slay his brother’s murderer, Bjorn, on sight. Sigwulf is awakened one morning by Bjorn, crippled in battle, asking for refuge in Sigwulf’s home. Since hospitality takes precedence over reliability (not breaking an oath) and loyalty (taking revenge for his brother’s killing), Sigwulf extends the guest-rite to Bjorn.

## Heroic Fate

Sometimes, heroes have a destiny that sets them apart from ordinary mortals. Different cultures may refer to it as destiny, fate, doom, or weird. Whatever it is called, heroes may live when others die, or succeed where others fail, due to the mysterious hand of fate. To represent the powers of fate, characters in *Heroic Fantasy Handbook* campaignsmay be awarded one or more Fate Points.

### Starting Allocation of Fate Points

Characters may begin with one or more Fate Points. We have provided a variety of methods by which starting Fate Points can be determined. While we have provided some recommendations, it is up to you to decide which method to use based on the desired tone of his campaign setting. You may use one method for player characters receive and another for NPCs if desired.

* **Chosen of the Gods:** Characters begin with 4 Fate Points, plus their Will modifier.
* **Fortune Favors the Bold:** Characters begin with 4 Fate Points, plus their highest attribute bonus.
* **Fate is Fickle:** Characters begin with 1d4 Fate Points.
* **Uncaring Fate:** Characters begin with 1 Fate Point.
* **Few are Chosen:** Characters begin with 1d4-3 Fate Points (minimum 0).
* **Luckless:** Characters begin with 0 Fate Points. This method is recommended for most NPCs.
* **Whim of the Overgod:** Characters begin with a number of Fate Points selected by you, from 0 to 20.

The player should record his character’s allocation of Fate Points on his character sheet.

EXAMPLE: Raknar the Red-Handed has STR 18, INT 14, WIL 10, DEX 16, CON 16, CHA 16, a mighty set of ability scores with which to crush the ornamented chairs of the world beneath his feet. Happily for Raknar, the Judge has decided to use the Fortune Favors the Bold method to assign starting Fate Points. He begins play with an allocation of 4 + 3 = 7 Fate Points recorded on his character sheet.

###### The Time of Man (Optional)

Some heroic fantasy settings presuppose that destiny favors the race of man over the dwarven, elven, or bestial races. You can implement this scenario in several different ways:

* Human and demi-human characters may determine starting Fate Points using two different methods. For example, human characters might be Chosen of the Gods, while demi-human characters suffer Uncaring Fate.
* The number of Fate Points that a demi-human character begins with may be reduced by one for each level which the character’s maximum level of experience is less than 14. (For example, elven spellswords begin with 4 fewer Fate Points).

### Spending Fate Points

A Fate Point may be used in the following ways:

* A character may spend a Fate Point after making an attack throw, proficiency throw, or saving throw to re-roll the throw. Additional Fate Points can be spent to re-roll again if desired. However, a character can **never** re-roll a natural 1. (This rule ensures that save-or-die effects are always dangerous, regardless of how many Fate Points a character has.)
* A character may spend a Fate Point after making a damage roll to re-roll the damage. Additional Fate Points can be spent to re-roll again if desired.
* A character may spend a Fate Point to cleave after a successful attack throw, even if not otherwise eligible to do so (e.g. because the target of the attack was not slain, or because the character has already cleaved to the maximum amount that round). Doing so does not count against the character’s maximum number of cleaves per round.
* A character may spend a Fate Point to cast a 1st level spell or perform a ceremony from the character’s repertoire in lieu of expending one of his daily slots, expending spell points, or suffering stigma. Additional Fate Points can be spent for higher level spells, using the spell point progression (see p. XX).
* A character may spend a Fate Point to temporarily gain one rank in any proficiency available to his class or to temporarily gain a thief ability (excluding backstab) at one-half his class level. The effect lasts 1 turn (10 minutes).
* A character with at least 1 hp may spend a Fate Point to recover hp equal to his Base Healing Rate in one turn of rest. This counts as magical healing for purposes of recovering from mortal wounds.
* A character with 0 or fewer hit points may spend a Fate Point to immediately recover to 1 hp. Unless the character has **savage resilience**, he is considered to have been knocked out and will need one night’s bed rest or magical healing. He must roll 1d6 on Row 21-25 of the Mortal Wounds table. If the character does have **savage resilience**, then he is considered to have been “just dazed” and does not need any bed rest. He may roll 1d6 twice on Row 26+ of the Mortal Wounds table and choose the preferred result.

Once expended, a Fate Point cannot be used again until it has been recovered. The player should record the running total of his character’s Fate Points expenditures on the character’s sheet..

EXAMPLE: Raknar the Red-Handed is an 8th level barbarian with 7 Fate Points. He is confronted by 8 ruffians. In the ensuing melee, Raknar slays one ruffian, and makes a cleave. Unfortunately, the result of his attack throw is a 2 – a miss! Rather than lose the opportunity to keep cleaving, he expends a Fate Point and re-rolls the throw. This time, the result is a 16, which hits. Raknar kills the second ruffian and keeps cleaving! Raknar’s player records the expenditure, noting that Raknar has 6 of his 7 Fate Points remaining.

### Recovering Fate Points

Characters may recover expended Fate Points in one of three ways, through **spending, solace,** or **advancement**. You may permit all three methods, just one of them, or no method at all, depending on his campaign setting.

###### Recovering through Spending

A character may recover all of his expended Fate Points by spending the monthly wage of a character of his level (**ACKS**, p. XX) to no other tangible game benefit whatsoever. This could include extravagant sacrifices to the gods; alms to the poor; anonymous tithes to churches; reckless spending on wine, women, and song; elaborate funeral pyres for deceased henchmen; and so on. Spending on goods that can be easily transported and resold (such as gems, jewelry, magic items, or trade goods) does not count.

Note that this rule is specifically designed to encourage adventurers to spend most or all of their Fate Points before recovering through spending, as the cost is the same whether one, some, or all Fate Points are recovered. This avoids the issue of adventurers constantly returning home to “top up” after spending one or two Fate Points.

EXAMPLE: Raknar the Red-Handed is an 8th level barbarian. During a recent adventure to seize the hoard of a Skysos war-chief, Raknar expended 4 of his 7 Fate Points. He wishes to recover his expended points by spending. As an 8th level character, Raknar’s monthly wage is 3,000gp so he must spend 3,000gp to no other tangible game benefit to regain his Fate Points. Raknar decides to sacrifice 120 bulls in a great show of devotion to his god Tür (3,000gp value at 25gp per bull). When the sacrifice is complete, Raknar recovers all his expended Fate Points.

###### Recovery through Solace

A character may recover all of his expended Fate Points by taking solace in an illuminated pinnacle of good (if Lawful) or a shadowed sinkhole of evil (if Chaotic) for one month. The time is reduced to two weeks in a hallowed pinnacle or blighted sinkhole, and to one week in a sacrosanct pinnacle or forsaken sinkhole. The character must spend at least 8 waking hours per day in the place of power. If Lawful, the time must be spent contemplating art, music, nature, poetry, and/or divinity. If Chaotic, the time must be spent in depraved and hedonistic pursuits. Neutral characters may not recover Fate Points from solace, nor may characters with a WIL of less than 9.

EXAMPLE: Thalos, an 11th level ecclesiastic in the service of Ammonar, has recently expended 3 Fate Points in a confrontation with an arch-priest of Dirgion. He wishes to recover his expended points by solace. He could take solace in his settlement’s temple to Ammonar (an illuminated pinnacle of good) and recover his points in one month. However, he knows of a holier place, a shrine to Ammonar built with a grove of a unicorn (a sacrosanct pinnacle). After four days traveling to the shrine, he spends seven days in contemplation there, then returns home. In total it has taken him (4 + 7 + 4) 15 days to recover his 3 Fate Points. (Note that Thalos could have recovered his points much faster had he sacrificed his monthly wage of 32,000gp… but that’s a lot of gold.)

###### Recovery Upon Advancement

A character may recover all of his expended Fate Points by advancing one level of experience. Note that if this form of recovery is the only one available in the campaign setting, maximum level characters will be unable to recovery Fate Points, and must rely on acquiring new ones using the methods below. This rule has the diegetic effect of explaining why high-level rulers and dark lords tend to avoid adventuring and direct confrontation, and why plucky young heroes may tend to win.

###### No Recovery (Optional)

In some campaigns, characters may not be able to recover Fate Points at all. In these harsh worlds, a character’s allocation of Fate Points is permanently reduced each time a Fate Point is expended.

### Acquiring Additional Fate Points

Characters may be able to increase their allocation of Fate Points in play. It is up to you to decide how additional Fate Points are accumulated once play begins. Choose one or more of the following methods:

* **Advancement:** Characters could increase their allocation of Fate Points by 1 each time they advance in level. This is the default method.
* **Blessing of Darkness:** Characters could increase their allocation of Fate Points each time they acquire a corrupting weakness.
* **Deeds of Renown:** Characters could increase their allocation of Fate Points by 1 or more each time they accomplish some notable task. This method allows you to reward your adventurers for advancing through a story-driven arc, should that style of play be to your taste.
* **Fulfilling their Fate:** Characters could increase their allocation of Fate Points by 1 or more each time they fulfill a prophecy that has been made about them, revealed by the **fate** spell, etc. This method is similar to Deeds of Renown, but less heavy-handed in that the adventurers may find ways to fulfill their fate that surprise you.
* **Sacrificing to their Gods:** Characters could increase their allocation of Fate Points by 1 or more by making a great sacrifice to their gods. A great sacrifice might be a legendary magic item, a loved one, an eye or hand, or a monetary sacrifice equal to 75% of the character’s accumulated XP. This method works well in games with the flavor of ancient myth, where the gods take an active hand in the affairs of heroes.
* **Woe to the Vanquished:** Characters cannot increase their allocation of Fate Points. Note that if this option is used in conjunction with the No Recovery option above, then Fate Points become a scarce consumable resource. This method is recommended for Judges who want to mitigate the dangers of low-level play without increasing the power of high-level heroes.

Unless you rules otherwise, characters can never have more Fate Points than their starting Fate Points plus their level of experience.

###### Only the Chosen (optional)

In some heroic fantasy settings, advancement to heroic power is simply beyond the ken of ordinary folk. In such settings, the local baker or blacksmith might not be able to reach 1st level of experience, let alone 14th level, no matter how many adventurers he survives. In these settings, it costs 1 Fate Point to advance in experience. Characters who have no Fate Points available must remain at their current level of experience until they recover or acquire a Fate Point.

The impact of this rule on play greatly depends on the options you have chosen for allocating initial Fate Points, recovering expended Fate Points, and acquiring additional Fate Points.

EXAMPLE #1: The “Only the Chosen” optional rule is in play. The Judge has selected “Fortune Favors the Bold” for the starting allocation of Fate Points for PCs and “Uncaring Fate” for NPCS; “No Recovery” as the method of recovery; and “Advancement” as the method of acquiring new Fate Points. Each adventurer will begin with 4-7 Fate Points, while each NPC will begin with 1d4-3. Once expended these points are gone forever. In order to advance to the next level of experience, an adventurer will have to expend 1 Fate Point, but when he does so he will gain the Fate Point back from advancing. An adventurer who expends all his Fate Points before advancing in level will have capped his advancement. An NPC who begins with 0 Fate Points (as most will) cannot ever hope to advance in level, as the only way to get a Fate Point is by advancing in level, but it requires Fate Points to advance.

EXAMPLE #2: The “Only the Chosen” optional rule is in play. The Judge has selected “Whims of the Overgod” for the starting allocation of Fate Points for PCs and NPCS; “No Recovery” as the method of recovery; and “Woe to the Vanquished” as the method of acquiring new Fate Points. Each PC and NPC will begin with 0 to 20 Fate Points, based on the Judge’s assessment of their cosmic importance. Once expended these points are gone forever and there is no way of acquiring new points. In order to advance to the next level of experience, an adventurer will have to expend 1 Fate Point, so the character’s starting allocation of Fate Points serves as an absolute cap on their maximum level. A character with only 4 Fate Points will never become a mighty wizard, even if he has INT 18. A character with 15 Fate Points is marked for greatness, even if his ability scores are but average.

## Item Loss from Damage

In ***ACKS II****,* certain spells (such as *shatter blade*), special maneuvers (such as Sunder), and monsters (such as slimes) can target and damage items, either automatically destroying them or forcing the wielder to make a saving throw. What ***ACKS II***does not account for is spillover damage that occurs when a creature is caught in the area of effect of damage. If you have a penchant for cruelty and/or realism, you can use these rules to impose item loss.

Anytime a creature is reduced -6hp or less by an area of effect attack against which it either received no saving throw or failed the saving throw, the creature’s carried and worn equipment is at risk of destruction. One stone of equipment will be destroyed at -6 hp, and another stone of equipment for each 6 additional damage. Treat each layer of clothing as 1 stone for these purposes. Use the Item Loss from Damage table, below, to determine the order in which equipment is lost. When multiple items are at risk, choose based on the circumstances or roll randomly.

Magic items receive a saving throw (of the type appropriate to the effect that caused the damage) to avoid destruction, saving with the adventurer’s progression and applying their bonus (if any) to the throw. Ordinary items are simply destroyed if 1 st or less. Items of 2 st or more are damaged proportional to their weight, reducing AC bonus granted if any by 1 per full stone damaged. If a heavy item’s damage is less than 1 stone, the damage is purely cosmetic and has no game effect.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Damaged from Front** | **Damaged from Flank / Rear** |
| Shield in hand (if any) | Equipment hanging from pack or back |
| Equipment worn/carried in hands or on torso | Equipment in backpack |
| Clothing worn over armor | Cloak or cape |
| Armor | Clothing worn under armor |
| Clothing worn under armor | Armor |
| Cloak or cape | Clothing worn over armor |
| Equipment in backpack | Equipment worn/carried in hands or on torso |
| Equipment hanging from pack or back | Shield in hand (if any) |

However, not every type of attack can damage every type of equipment. Use the Materials Destroyed by Damage Type table to decide if a particular item is vulnerable based on its primary material (use common sense). If a particular item is not vulnerable to the damage, skip that item when moving through the Item Loss from Damage table.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Damage Type** | **Material** |
| Acidic | Ceramic, cloth, food, fur, horn, leather, metal, paper, wood |
| Arcane | Ceramic, cloth, fur, glass, horn, leather, metal, paper, stone, wood |
| Bludgeoning | Ceramic, glass, metal, stone, wood |
| Cold | Ceramic, glass, metal, stone, wood |
| Electric | Ceramic, combustibles (e.g. oil), glass, metal, paper, wood |
| Fire | Ceramic, cloth, combustibles (e.g. oil), food, fur, horn, leather, paper, wood |
| Luminous | “Evil” items (e.g. unholy water) |
| Necrotic | Cloth, food, fur, horn, leather, paper, wood, and “good” items (e.g. holy water) |
| Piercing | Ceramic, glass |
| Poisonous | None |
| Seismic | Ceramic, glass, metal, stone, wood |
| Slashing | Ceramic, cloth, fur, horn, leather, paper, wood |

EXAMPLE: Andravus has just bene struck by a *fireball* that has reduced him to -18 hp. Therefore, he is at risk of three stone worth of items being destroyed. Because the damage type is fire, only ceramic, cloth, combustibles (e.g. oil), food, fur, horn, leather, paper, and wood items are at risk.

Assume he is carrying a wooden spear and shield and wearing an adventurer’s harness with 2 metal flasks of military oil, 2 metal flasks of holy water, and 2 wineskins; a leather belt with 2 belt pouches containing 50gp each; scale armor; a cloak; and a backpack containing 6 torches and 1 stone of food.

If Andravus were damaged from the front, he would lose the wooden shield (1 st); the wooden spear (1 st); the 2 flasks of military oil (2/6 st), the two leather wineskins (2/6 st), and then the belt pouch (1/6 st) and the adventurer’s harness (1/6 st). The metal flasks of holy water and the gold coins are metal and therefore undamaged by fire, though both would fall to the floor. Had he taken another 6 fire damage, Andravus’s scale armor would have been damaged, reducing its AC bonus from 3 to 2.

If Andravus were damaged from the rear, he would lose the backpack (1/6 st), the 6 torches (1 st), and the food (1 st). The cloak (1st) then takes 5/6 st of damage. It’s badly singed but still usable. Had he taken another 6 fire damage, Andravus’s cloak would be destroyed and his armor singed.

## Naming Arms and Armor

When creating a magic weapon, shield, or suit of armor, its creator must give the item a name. Only those who confidently speak the name of the item receive the full benefit of its powers. If a character is unsure of an item’s name, he may guess once; if incorrect, he may not guess again until reaching a higher level of experience.

Alternatively, when an item is found, it may be given a new name by its wielder or wearer. Upon first naming the item, the character receives the benefit of one of its bonuses in one category (e.g. +1 to hit, +1 to damage, +1 to AC, -1 to encumbrance) or of a special power or ceremonial spell. With each level of experience earned wielding or wearing his re-named item, the character unlocks an additional point of bonus in one category, until all bonuses in all categories are unlocked. You make the determination of the order in which the item’s powers unlock.

EXAMPLE: In the tomb of Durin Blackfist, Raknar discovers an ancient war hammer, gleaming and rune-carved. He decides this must be Durin’s hammer Fist of Iron and announces such. In battle, the war hammer reveals itself a +3 weapon – Raknar was right!

Like a true Jutland hero, Raknar dies fighting, his body sprawled on a mound of orc corpses. Later, a young 1st level fighter named Marcus finds the rune-carved war hammer. Knowing it to be magical, but not having any idea of its origin, he names the hammer Tooth-Breaker. In his next fight, Marcus gets a +1 bonus to damage from Tooth-breaker. When he reaches 2nd level, Marcus finds that Tooth-Breaker is +1 to hit and damage. When he is 3rd level, it becomes +1 to hit and +2 to damage, and so on, until at 6th level it reaches its full power of +3 to hit and damage.

But what if Marcus were slain at 4th level, after unlocking Fist of Iron / Tooth-Breaker’s powers to the level of +2 to hit and +2 to damage? Assume his henchman, Peristo, now claims Tooth-Breaker. It is a +2 weapon in his hands. When Peristo gains a level, Tooth-Breaker will become +2 to hit and +3 to damage. If Peristo were to discover that this weapon is also Fist of Iron, it would immediately reach its full +3 powers.

## Overcasting

In some settings, spellcasters can push themselves beyond the ordinary limits of magic, accomplishing more than is normally possible – albeit at great risk. Use these rules if you want magic-users to be more powerful and unpredictable.

### Overview

Casters of Arcane and Divine magic can attempt to Overcast extra spells beyond those they are allotted each day. Each time that a spell is Overcast, however, the player must roll a d20 and consult the Overcasting Success table. Failure results in a fumble. Throwing an unmodified 20 results in an automatic Overcasting Success. Throwing an unmodified 1 is an automatic failure.

Subsequent attempts to Overcast require successively higher throws to succeed. The Overcasting Success throw is reset each time the caster meets his studious or prayerful requirements.

EXAMPLE: A 1st-level mage can normally cast one 1st-level spell per day. If she elects to Overcast a second 1st-level spell on the same day before resting, she fumbles the spell on a throw of 1-5. A third spell cast through Overcasting before resting will result in a fumble on a d20 throw of 1-10.

A caster cannot Overcast spells of a level to which he does not already have access. However, custom classes built with the alternative spell progression table (who cannot cast spells at 1st level), can Overcast 1st-level spells, even though they do not normally have access to spellcasting until 2nd-level. Doing so is considered the first Overcast of the day and requires an Overcasting Success throw of 6+.

A caster can choose to spend double the time Overcasting a spell in order to gain a bonus of +2 to the Overcasting Success throw. In most cases, this means taking two rounds to Overcast a spell. The player must indicate that he is taking double the casting time when the casting of the spell is declared. Note that if the character takes damage or fails a saving throw at any time during the Overcast before the spell goes off, the spell is lost. In this case, no success throw is made, but it does count as an attempt.

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Overcasting Success** | | |
| Attempt of the Day | Throw | Throw w/ Double Time |
| 1st | 6+ | 4+ |
| 2nd | 11+ | 9+ |
| 3rd | 16+ | 14+ |
| 4th | 20+ | 18+ |

### Arcane Calamity

When a caster of arcane magic fumbles due to Overcasting, he must roll d% on the Arcane Calamity table. A calamity represents a mistake of some kind. Perhaps the caster mispronounced a magical syllable, or waggled his fingers the wrong way. The caster might also have let his guard down, allowing the extra-planar creature he had bound to his will to gain the upper hand.

### Divine Transgression

When a caster of divine magic fumbles due to Overcasting, he must roll d% on the Divine Transgression table. The transgression might be that he misspoke a prayer or performed a holy ritual incorrectly. The caster’s deity, or their intercessor, might decide to teach them a lesson. It might just be a rough day in the Spheres of Existence. The gods are fickle, callous, and pernicious, and they and their representatives sometimes care little for the travails of mere mortals.

### Axioms Tables

The Arcane Calamity and Divine Transgression tables presented in ***ACKS II***have been modified from their original tables published in ***AXIOMS Issue 1****.* While the odds of a negative outcome are identical on both tables, the original ***AXIOMS***tables have a wider variety of effects, many of which could permanently change the campaign setting by e.g. creating places of power, altering the weather, inflicting a plague, and so on. These results could be very exciting, but they made some Judges reluctant to introduce overcasting into their campaigns because they did not want low-level casters to be able to have such a powerful impact when they screwed up. However, if you prefer your magic to be wild, powerful, and strange, the tables found in ***AXIOMS Issue 1***are fully compatible with ***ACKS II****.*

|  |  |

| **98-99** | **Bolt from Heaven:** The deity smites the caster with a bolt from heaven. The caster is immediately slain. While he can be restored to life, no one of his faith will do so willingly. Any divine caster of the same god who casts *restore life and limb* on the caster will also be smote by the deity! |
| **100** | **Death:** At the behest of the caster’s deity, shadowy servants of death erupt from the ground and pull him body and soul into the underworld. The caster cannot be restored to life by any means short of *miracle* or *wish*. |

### Additional Rules

The following additional rules are included to provide the Judge with additional ways to augment Overcasting for her campaign.

#### Calamity and Disfavor

The Judge should feel free to use the Arcane Calamity and Divine Transgression tables for appropriate situations other than Overcasting. For example, if a Cleric does something particularly offensive in the eyes of his deity, perhaps a roll on the Divine Transgression table is in order.

#### Power and Risk

Some Judges might prefer that the risk of Overcasting should increase with the power of the spell being attempted. This is so that the Overcasting of higher-level spells becomes relatively more dangerous. In this case, add the level of the spell to the Overcasting Success throw number needed to avoid a fumble or, alternatively, add the level of the spell to the roll on the Arcane Calamity and Divine Disfavor tables.

#### Proficiencies

At the Judge’s discretion, the following Class Proficiencies become available to Arcane and Divine casters. Players who elect to use any of these proficiencies must substitute each one taken for an existing class proficiency, permanently losing access to the replaced proficiency.

###### Careful Overcaster

When taking double the amount of time to Overcast a spell, the character gains a bonus of +4 to the Overcasting Success throw, instead of the normal +2 bonus.

###### Master Overcaster

The character gains a +1 to all Overcasting Success throws. This proficiency may be taken only once.

## Proportional Healing

Hit points are a measure of a character’s ability to survive in combat. Hit points are *not* a direct representation of the character’s capacity to receive physical injury. A character with 40 hp cannot survive eight sword stabs to the stomach! Rather, they represent a holistic combination of fighting skill, stamina, luck, and the favor of the gods, all of which contribute to helping the character roll with blows and survive attacks that would have killed a lesser combatant. Therefore, the amount of damage a weapon deals must be understood relative to the hit points of the character struck. It is the percentage of hit points lost, not the raw number lost, that indicates how physically wounded a character or monster is.

However, the elegant abstraction of hit points is marred by an asymmetry between damage and healing. Consider two characters, a normal man with 5 hp and an epic hero with 40 hp. When the normal man is dealt 4 points of damage by a sword, this is a grievous blow (80% of his hit points); when the epic hero is dealt the same 4 points of damage, this is merely a flesh wound (10% of his hp). This is exactly as it should be. Yet when the epic hero is treated with *cure light injury*, he recovers 1d6+1 points of damage – enough to repair a light wound, as the spell suggests; while when the normal man is treated with *cure light injury*, he is likely to recover from what we just said was a grievous blow that brought him near death. To fix this asymmetry, you can use these optional rules for proportional healing.

### Base Healing Rate

All beings recover hit points through rest. For each full day of dedicated rest in reasonably sanitary conditions, a creature will recover its **base healing rate (BHR)**. If its rest is interrupted, the creature will not heal that day. A creature’s base healing rate is based on its maximum hit points, as shown on the Base Healing Rate table. A character’s BHR should be recorded on its character sheet, and updated each time the character gains additional hit points.

EXAMPLE: Athelstan has 12 hp. His base healing rate is 1d4 hp per day. With a full day of complete rest in sanitary conditions, Athelstan will recover between 1 and 4 hp. If his rest is interrupted, he will not heal.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Max HP** | **BHR (hp/day)** |
| 1-3 | 1d2 |
| 4-9 | 1d3 |
| 10-16 | 1d4 |
| 17-23 | 1d6 |
| 24-29 | 1d8 |
| 30-36 | 1d10 |
| 37-49 | 2d6 |
| 50-63 | 2d8 |
| 64-76 | 2d10 |
| 77-89 | 2d12 |
| 90-110 | 3d10 |
| 111-140 | 4d10 |
| 141-170 | 5d10 |
| 171+ | 6d10, plus 1d10  per 30hp past 170 |

Characters with the Healing proficiency can shorten their patient’s recovery time. A patient under treatment of Healing recovers twice his base healing rate in hp each day of rest, or his base healing rate without rest.

EXAMPLE: If Athelstan were the patient of a character with Healing proficiency, he would recover twice his base healing rate of 1d4 hp per day of rest, i.e. 2d4 hp per day of rest.

Healing also occurs through magic, such as potions or spells. This kind of healing is instantaneous and will typically be equal to one or more days of rest, as shown on the Magical Healing table. Magical healing and natural healing can be combined.

EXAMPLE: Athelstan (with 12 hp and a base healing rate of 1d4 hp) has sustained 9 points of damage, leaving him with 3 hp. A cleric treats him with comfrey. Comfrey heals its target by half as much as if he had rested for one day, rounded up. Athelstan’s base healing rate is 1d4 hp per day, so he will heal 1d4/2 hp. The result of the roll is a 3, so Athelstan is healed (3 / 2) 1.5 hp, rounded up to 2 hp. The cleric then casts *cure moderate injury*on Athelstan. *Cure moderate injury* heals its target as if he had rested for two days, so Athelstan will heal 2d4 hp. The result of the roll is a 5, so Athelstan is healed 5 points. He now has 10 hp of his maximum of 12.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Spell** | **Effect\*** |
| *Salving Rest* | The target’s base healing rate is doubled for non-magical healing, or tripled if under care of a healer. |
| *Cure Light Injury* | The target is healed as if he had rested for one day. |
| *Cure Moderate Injury* | The target is healed as if he had rested for two days. |
| *Cure Major Injury* | The target is healed as if he had rested for three days. |
| *Cure Serious Injury* | The target is healed as if he had rested for four days. |
| *Cure Critical Injury* | The target is healed as if he had rested for five days. |
| *Spirit of Healing* | Each round, the target is healed as if he had rested for one day. |
| *Lay on Hands* | The target is healed as if he had rested for one day per two levels of the healer (rounded up). |
| *Comfrey* | The target is healed by half as much as if he had rested for one day (rounded up). |
| \*These effects occur instead of the spell’s effect under the ***ACKS II***core rules. Reversed healing spells deal necrotic damage qual to what they would have healed. | |

**Heroic Breakfast Memorial Rule (Optional):** Once per day a character can recover his base healing rate in hp by consuming a meal accompanied by alcohol, coffee, or tea. This recovery is in addition to any hit points gained from complete rest. Halfling characters can consume a second breakfast for an additional recovery of hp.

## Rule of the Few

The classic philosophers divided governments into four basic types: those ruled by one (monarchies), those ruled by a few (oligarchies), those ruled by all (democracies), and those ruled by a mix of the prior three types (polities). Monarchies are already well-addressed by the Core Rules, while polities can be handled using the rules for senatorial realms. Here we offer rules to model **oligarchies**, also known as **oligarchic realms.** These realms are governed by a select group who collectively set policy, known as **oligarchs**.

### Game Mechanics for Oligarchic Realms

The following rules apply to an oligarchic realm:

* The oligarchy is considered the ruler of the realm with its own Charisma, alignment, and level for these purposes.
* The Charisma of the oligarchy is determined by finding the average Charisma modifier of the oligarchs. For purposes of this calculation, add +1 to an oligarch’s Charisma modifier if he has Leadership proficiency. Do not add Leadership proficiency to Base Morale separately.
* The class level of the oligarchy is determined by finding the average class level of the oligarchs of the realm. This average level is then cross-referenced with the oligarchy’s average domain income (domain income per oligarch) to find the oligarchy’s Personal Authority.
* The alignment of the oligarchy is determined as follows. If at least two-thirds are Lawful, the oligarchy is Lawful. If at least one-half are Lawful, and none are Chaotic, the oligarchy is Lawful. If at least one-half are Chaotic, the oligarchy is Chaotic. In all other circumstances, the oligarchy is Neutral.
* The oligarchy does not have henchmen, but it can still have vassal domains. The vassals of the oligarchy can be ruled by the henchmen of any of the oligarchs or by non-henchman vassals. The vassal domains pays tribute to the oligarchic realm, but a henchmen’s loyalty remains to his oligarch, not to the oligarchy as a whole. If a demand for a duty (e.g. construction, call to arms, tax demanded, or loan demanded) is made on a vassal by the oligarchy that is against the wishes of the oligarch who commands the vassal’s loyalty, the vassal is considered a non-henchman vassal for purposes of the Henchman loyalty check to that demand. For henchmen vassals, tribute inefficiency is determined by the number for each oligarch and applied towards the tribute paid by that oligarch’s henchmen. For non-henchmen vassals, tribute inefficiency is determined by the total number of non-henchmen vassals for the oligarchy as a whole.
* Domain revenue is collected by the oligarchy. Domain expenses are paid by the oligarchy. Domain income is then split between all of the oligarchs equally, who earn campaign XP equal to their share of domain income less their GP Threshold. (Individual oligarchies may allocate the actual GP differently if desired, but XP is always calculated as above.)
* All decisions regarding the realm are made by the oligarchy. By default, majority rules, but particular oligarchies may establish other rules. In the event that an oligarchy cannot come to a consensus on a particular decision, then whatever policy applied the prior year, season, or month (as appropriate) is applied.
* The oligarchy may benefit from the Administering the Domain campaign activity only if every oligarch who is eligible to administer the oligarchy actually administers the domain. Most oligarchies, as a result, are not that well-run. Of course, an oligarchy administered by a single ruler is actually a senatorial realm!

### Establishing an Oligarchic realm

An oligarchic realm can be established in one of three ways.

1. The ruler of a realm can voluntarily relinquish power to an oligarchy that he establishes.
2. The senators of an existing senatorial realm can depose the ruler and assume power as an oligarchy.
3. Several independent domains can merge their realms together into one larger realm, establishing an oligarchy as the new realm’s governing body.

When an existing realm becomes an oligarchy, the realm’s base morale score is updated to reflect the characteristics of the oligarchy.

### Multiracial Oligarchies

From time to time, an oligarchy might be formed in which the rulers are drawn from two or more races, such as dwarves, elves, and/or humans. The following rules apply.

#### Oligarchs

Each race will expect to have some oligarchs of its own kind. The number of oligarchs of each race must be in proportion to the percentage of the realm’s peasant families of each race. If the ratio of becomes out of proportion by more than 10%, the domain suffers a -1 on domain morale rolls for each race which is underrepresented in the oligarchy.

#### Strongholds

The domain can use one stronghold or several strongholds to secure its territory. Each stronghold must be assigned to a particular oligarch and must follow the rules for that oligarch’s race and class. If the domain has multiple strongholds, then the territory secured by each stronghold must be settled by peasants of the same race as that stronghold’s oligarch.

#### Territory

Some races insist on either being ruled by members of their own race or living apart from other races. Dwarves, elves, and gnomes will settle in unsettled territory, in outland hexes ruled by any oligarch, and in civilized or borderlands hexes ruled by an oligarch of their own race. Beastmen, halflings, and humans will settle under any race.

#### Terrain

Some races prefer to live in different types of terrain. Any race will settle in a hex of clear or river terrain. Dwarves will also settle in badlands, hills, or mountain terrain, or any hex that can be mined. Elves will also settle in jungle, scrub, swamp, or woods terrain. Beastmen, halflings, and humans will settle in any hex.

#### Keeping the Peace

The tension caused by the clash of cultures permanently decreases Base Morale Score by 1 if two races cohabit and by 2 if three or more races cohabit.

The peasant families in each hex of territory must be protected by a garrison made up of troops of their own race. The ratio of garrison expenditure must be in proportion to the percentage of the realm’s peasant families of each race. If the ratio of becomes out of proportion by more than 10%, the domain suffers a -1 on domain morale rolls for each race which is underrepresented in the oligarchy.

If bandits emerge, the Judge will determine whether they are arising from peasants of a specific race (with its own grievances) or are a coalition of free peoples irked at their oligarchs in general.

#### Growing the Domain

Peasant population growth is calculated on a hex-by-hex basis by race, applying the modifiers for each race. Human peasant population growth will thus, over time, outstrip dwarven and elven population growth, unless agricultural investment counterbalances this.

Agricultural investments attract new peasant families based on the hex they are made in. The maximum amount that may be spent is not increased, however, so investments have to be balanced over time if necessary.

#### Urban Settlements

The domain can have one urban settlement made up of a multiracial mix of urban families. Urban investment and urban population growth attract new urban families in proportion to the mix of peasant families of the prior month. The urban population grows in size as if it were the most fecund race (e.g. at the fastest rate). Because of the division of labor generated by the mosaic of cultures, each urban family generates an additional 0.5gp per month in trade revenue!

#### Conscripts and Militia

If conscripts are levied, or militia called, they belong to the races of the families that provided the conscript or militia troops. If conscripts or militia are summoned out of proportion to the percentage of the domain’s peasant families, the domain suffers a -1 on domain morale rolls for each race which is over-represented in the troops.

#### Dwarven Vaults

Dwarven peasant families settled in a hex secured by a dwarven vault with access to adequate timber and water can engage in mushroom farming. The rules from ***By This Axe***apply.

Dwarven peasant families settled in a hex with a mine or quarry can still be assigned to serve as work gangs on that mine or quarry. Dwarven peasant families from outside the hex or dwarven urban families from the domain’s settlement may not be assigned to serve as work gangs, because they acquire uppity attitudes and poor work ethic from their neighbors.

There is no morale penalty for having dwarves work on ore deposits provided that no other work gangs are used. The dwarven work gangs gain the Lore of Ore and Industrial Improvements benefits. They may Delve Deeper if desired. Dwarves will not work on mines or quarries in a domain of work gangs of other races are also employed, considering it their purview to do so exclusively.

#### Elven Fastnesses

An elven oligarch with stronghold in a place of natural beauty gains his friendship of animals power in the area around his stronghold provided his territory is populated exclusively by elven families.

#### Separating Land and Lordship

An oligarchy may separate land and lordship if desired using the rules on the following page. The oligarchy as a whole functions as the governor of the domain in this case. Individual oligarchs can be landowners if desired. This will be complex – but that’s why these are optional rules.

### Dissolving an Oligarchic realm

An oligarchic realm can be dissolved in several ways.

1. The realm can be conquered. The conqueror can replace the oligarchy with a ruler loyal to himself, add a ruler while retaining the oligarchy as a senate, or have the oligarchy become his vassal.
2. The oligarchs of an existing oligarchy can agree to appoint a ruler over themselves, either becoming senators of a senatorial realm or dissolving entirely.
3. The oligarchs of an existing oligarchy can voluntarily dissolve the oligarchy, allocating territory to the various oligarchs who control strongholds within the oligarchy.
4. One or more of the oligarchs can secede from the oligarchy. If this occurs, the former oligarch’s new domain will consist of the families and territory within whichever stronghold(s) he controls. If any of the oligarchy’s vassals are his henchmen, each of those henchmen will make a loyalty roll; if they remain loyal, they will become his vassals, and their sub-domains will constitute part of his new realm.

The new domain(s) must have their base morale score(s) updated to reflect the characteristics of the new ruler or rulers.

## Separating Land and Lordship

By default, ***ACKS II***assumes a feudal structure in which private property ownership and public governance are unified, e.g. the ruler is a literal *land-lord*. This was the *de jure* state of affairs during the Middle Ages, and it was the *de facto* state for much of recorded history. More importantly, it is the simplest model of rulership for a game to simulate. Judges simulating particular types of governments or periods of history might, however, wish to separate land ownership from governance.

For game purposes, we will define a **landowner** as an owner of land within a domain he does not rule, and a **governor** as the ruler of a domain who does not own the land he rules. The domain the governor controls we will call a **bureaucratic domain**. Conversely, we will define a **landed lord** as a ruler who is both governor and landowner; the domain he controls we will call a **feudal domain**.

#### Revenue and Expenses

Revenue and expenses in a bureaucratic domain are allocated between the landowner and the governor as follows.

1. The landowner collects the domain’s land revenue and service revenue. The governor collects the domain’s tax revenue and tribute revenue, as well as all of its urban settlement’s revenue.
2. The landowner pays the domain’s liturgy, maintenance, tithe, and tribute expenses. The governor pays the domain’s garrison expenses and all of its urban settlement expenses.

EXAMPLE: A domain consists of 2,000 peasant families generating 12,000gp in monthly land revenue, 8,000gp in monthly service revenue, and 4,000gp in monthly tax revenue. The domain has four vassal domains, each paying 2,100gp in tribute (8,200gp total). Its total revenue is 32,200gp.The domain has garrison expenses of 4,000gp, liturgies of 2,000gp, maintenance of 2,000gp, tithes of 2,000gp, and tribute of 6,000gp. Its total expenses are 16,000gp. Domain income is (32,200 – 16,000) = 16,200gp.

The domain has an urban settlement with 200 urban families generating 1,500gp in total revenue. The settlement has garrison expenses of 400gp, liturgies of 200gp, tithes of 200gp, and upkeep of 200gp. Its total expenses are 1,000gp. Settlement income is (1,500gp – 1,000gp) = 500gp, which increase domain income to 16,700gp.

However, rulership over the domain is split between Tavic Tyros, its landowner, and Marcus Ambador, its governor. Tavic Tyros collects the domain’s land revenue (12,000gp) and service revenue (8,000gp), for a total of 20,000gp. He pays the domain’s liturgy (2,000gp), maintenance (2,000gp), tithe (2,000gp), and tribute expenses (6,000gp), for a total of 12,000gp. His domain income is (20,000 – 12,000) 8,000gp per month.

Marcus Ambador collects the domain’s tax revenue (4,000gp) and its tribute revenue (8,200gp), as well as all of the urban revenue (1,500gp), for a total of 13,700gp. He pays the domain’s garrison expense (4,000gp, and all of the settlement expenses (1,000gp), for a total of 5,000gp. Governor Ambador’s domain income is (13,700gp – 5,000gp) 8,700gp per month.

###### Tax Rate

If the governor raises the tax rate, the landowner may decide to pay the tax or pass the tax on to the peasantry. If the former, the landowner’s domain revenue is decreased. If the latter, domain morale is decreased by the increase in taxes. NPC landowners will pass the tax on to the peasantry.

EXAMPLE: Ambador raises the tax rate from 2gp per family to 3gp per family, increasing his domain revenue by 2,000gp. Tyros must either pay the increased tax from his share of domain revenue, decreasing his domain income by 2,000gp; or must pass the tax on to the peasants, which will impose a -1 penalty on domain morale rolls.

###### Multiple Landowners

A governor may rule a bureaucratic domain with two or more landowners. In this case, each landowner receives only a proportion of the overall landowner share of the domain’s revenue, expenses, and income. The proportion should be determined by the Judge based on each landowner’s holdings.

EXAMPLE: Upon his death, Tavic Tyros grants his lands to his two sons, Uric and Viktor. Uric, the elder, receives three-quarters of the lands, while Viktor receives one-quarter of the lands. Assuming no other changes to the domain, Uric will have a net monthly income of (8,000 x 3/4) 6000gp and Viktor will have a net monthly income of (8,000 x 1/4) 2,000gp.

###### Landowning Governors

A governor can be a landowner in his own bureaucratic domain and would have domain revenues, expenses, and income equal to his percentage of the landowner domain income plus the governor’s portion of the domain income.

EXAMPLE: Uric sells his parcels of land to governor Ambador. Ambador now has a net monthly income of 6,000gp (from land ownership) and 8,700gp (from governance) for a total of 14,700gp. Viktor has a net monthly income of 2,000gp. If Ambador manages to acquire Viktor’s parcels of lands as well, his net monthly income would be (14,700gp + 2,00gp) 16,700gp. At that point Ambador would effectively be a landed lord.

###### Freeholds

The peasant families who work the land may actually own the land of the domain. Such a domain may be called a freehold or democracy. If at least one-third of the domain’s land is owned by its peasants, the domain morale score gains a +1 bonus. If at least two-thirds of the domain’s land is owned by its peasant families, the domain morale score gains a +2 bonus.

EXAMPLE: Imagine that Tavic had divided all his land equally among the peasants who worked for him. This would have resulted in 2,000 landowners, each with a net income of 5gp. A typical peasant family has an income of about 4gp per month from its labor, and this wage income (which is implicitly already factored out of domain income) would stack with their domain income as landowners. Tavic’s generosity would create a domain of prosperous middle-class freeholders earing about 9gp per month (see *The Economics of Peasant Households* on p. XX for more details). The domain’s morale score gains a +2 bonus.

###### Urban City-States

It is also possible for land to be held (in various combinations) by some or all of the urban families in the domain’s settlement. The peasant families would then represent sharecroppers or tenants of the wealthy urban property-owners. If at least one-third of the domain’s land is owned by its urban families, the domain’s morale score gains a +1 bonus. If at least two-thirds of the domain’s land is owned by its urban families, the domain’s morale score gains a +2 bonus.

EXAMPLE: Imagine that Tavic had divided all his land equally among the 200 urban families in his settlement. This would have resulted in 200 landowners, each with a net income of 50gp. Since there are 2,000 peasant families, each urban family would own land worked by 10 peasant families; at 30 acres per family that is around 300 acres.

#### Becoming a Governor or Landowner

Any character can become a landowner by acquiring property and hiring laborers to work on the land. Property might be acquired by purchases, theft, conquest, inheritance, or any other means.

A character can become a governor in a variety of ways, depending on the setting and campaign. Governors might be holders of hereditary offices, conquerors who have chosen to leave the prior landowners in possession of their land, officials elected by the landowners, magistrates appointed by an urban council, delegates of the realm’s ruler, or new rulers who have purposefully established bureaucratic domains.

###### Establishing New Realms

An adventurer who founds a new domain can declare that peasants who settle in his territory will gain ownership of the land they. An adventurer who grants one-third of the land to incoming peasant families will receive double the number of starting peasants. An adventurer who grants two-thirds of the land to his peasant families will receive triple the number of starting peasants.

###### Authority of Governors

Unless the Judge determines otherwise, the governor is the ruler of the domain. Domain morale is based on the governor’s Charisma and proficiencies. The authority to set the domain’s tax rate, hire and manage the garrison, command any military activities, and make any other decisions is vested in the governor. However, investment expenditure can be made by either or both the landowner and the governor out of their respective share of the net income.

###### Senatorial Realms

Many bureaucratic realms are also senatorial realms, in which the landowners hold positions as senators. A governor with a senate must consult the senate before making key decisions such as going to war or raising taxes. See ***ACKS II******Revised Rulebook***p. XX.

#### Campaign XP for Governors and Landowners

Regardless of his actual percentage of the domain’s income, the governor earns full XP for it (e.g. from the total of its land, service, tax, and tribute revenue, less its garrison, liturgies, tithes, and tributes). The landowner does not earn any campaign XP as his role is strictly passive.

EXAMPLE: Since the domain’s income is 18,350gp per month, Marcus Ambador would receive 18,350 XP per month, less his GP Threshold. If Marcus is 10th level, with a GP Threshold of 18,000gp, he would receive 350 XP per month.

**Senatorial Realms:** If the bureaucratic realm is also a senatorial realm, and the landowners are actively influencing government policy, they may share in the campaign XP. To calculate landowner XP in a bureaucratic senatorial realm, follow these steps each month:

1. Calculate the **available XP** by subtracting the ruler’s GP Threshold from the domain’s monthly income.
2. Allocate half of the available XP to the ruler.
3. Divide the remaining half of the available XP among the landowners according to their percentage of the land owned. The landowners do *not* subtract their own GP Threshold.

EXAMPLE: Tavic has divided all his land equally among the 200 urban families in his settlement. Governor Marcus Ambador has established a senate with 200 seats for the families. Marcus is 10th level, with a GP Threshold of 18,000gp. Domain income is 18,350gp. The available XP is (18,350 – 18,000) 350 XP, of which Marcus receives 50% (175 XP). The other 175 XP is split between the 200 senators, who receive (175/200) 1 XP each.

If Marcus were 9th level, with a GP Threshold of 12,000gp, then the available XP would be (18,000 – 12,000) 6,000 XP. Marcus would receive 3,000 XP and each of the 200 senators would receive 15 XP. Yes, the senate has a perverse incentive to have a weak ruler!

**Designer’s Notes:** Separating land and lordship has interesting implications for gameplay. The most obvious implication is that governors will tend to earn less income than landed lords who are both governors and landowners. However, in the context of a game world, governors are likely to be drawn from the landowning families; even if a governor doesn’t own the land he governs, it is entirely likely that he owns land elsewhere. E.g. the governor of Spain might have extensive land in Gaul, while the governor of Gaul has land in Libya, and the governor of Libya has land in Spain. *The net income of governors and landed lords is thus likely to be the same.*

However, governors are more likely to exploit than cultivate their domains. Governors are incentivized to raise the tax rate higher than standard ***ACKS***rulers, as higher taxes accrue to his benefit, while the losses from low morale are split. Landowners are incentivized to spend the minimum on liturgies, as the gains from high morale are split, while the costs are entirely borne by them. Because gains from agricultural investment are shared across landowner and governor, while costs of agricultural investment are born by one or the other, such domains will tend to see less land investment (unless the two rulers are cooperative). However, gains from urban investment will accrue entirely to the governor, who receives all of the urban revenue. *Overall then, governor’s domains will tend to be more heavily taxed and be more urbanized than typical* ***ACKS*** *domains.*

Some historical realms began as city-states or small republics, with elected governors appointed over landowners, then slowly transitioned to a feudal system of landed lords instead. Usually this transition began when governors of new or provincial regions were granted the use of lands within their distant territories for their upkeep. (Often these lands were seized from conquered peoples.) This weakened the former ruling class, encouraged the governors to defend their assigned territories, and reduced the tax burden on the state. Such lands theoretically belonged to the office rather than to the man holding the office. Over time, however, such offices tended to become hereditary, and the lands associated with the office did as well. Eventually feudal systems emerged.

With the above in mind, the core rules of ***ACKS***remain entirely workable as a simulation of a realm of governors and landowners. In most circumstances, most governors will have sufficient lands of their own to make as much as they would if they were landed lords, and much of that land could be in areas they govern. Thus a Judge can safely treat the landowner and governor as one with little mechanical impact on the realm’s revenue, income, army, etc., reserving more complex nuanced structures only for those domains where the political arrangements are likely to impact gameplay.

## Shields

Throughout history, the type of shield carried by warriors has varied depending on the warrior’s arms, armor, and equipment. These optional rules allow you to simulate these historical variations. When these rules apply,
standard shields should not be available; all shields have a type. In addition, note that characters do not gain a benefit from their shields when **vulnerable** when using these rules. (This is to make up for the other benefits the new shields offer.)

###### Auxiliary Shield

An auxiliary shield is a hexagonal or oval shield measuring approximately 2’ wide and 3.5’ tall. It is designed for light infantry and cavalry soldiers. An auxiliary shield can be carried in hand or strapped on the back to free up both hands. When equipped in hand by a dismounted character, an auxiliary shield grants a +1 bonus to his Armor Class except when the character is surprised, retreating, or attacked from behind. When equipped in hand by a mounted character, an auxiliary shield grants a +1 bonus to his *or* his mount’s Armor Class except when the character is vulnerable. The character can alternate between using the shield to protect himself or his mount each time he moves. When strapped on the back, an auxiliary shield grants a +1 bonus to Armor Class when the character is attacked from behind. Fighting Style Specialization (Weapon & Shield) does not increase this bonus. However it is carried, an auxiliary shield has an encumbrance of 1 stone. Historical examples include the Roman *parma* and various cavalry shields of Antiquity.

###### Buckler

A buckler is a round shield with a diameter of up to 2’. It has an encumbrance of 1 item. A buckler can be used by infantry or cavalry, but takes considerable skill. Characters with Fighting Style Specialization (Weapon & Shield) gain a +1 bonus to Armor Class when they have a buckler equipped. Other characters gain no benefit. An equipped buckler does not protect a character (or mount) that is vulnerable. The chief historical example is the Renaissance buckler.

###### Crescent Shield

A crescent shield is an oval-shaped shield with cut-outs on one or both sides to form a single or double crescent shape. It is designed for both infantry and cavalry soldiers. A crescent shield can be carried in hand or strapped on the front or back to free up both hands. When equipped in hand, a crescent shield grants a +1 bonus to Armor Class except when the character is vulnerable. It has an encumbrance of 1 stone. When strapped on the front, a crescent shield grants a +1 bonus to Armor Class except when the character is vulnerable. Fighting Style Specialization (Weapon & Shield) does not increase this bonus. When strapped on the back, a crescent shield grants a +1 bonus to Armor Class when the character is attacked from behind. Fighting Style Specialization (Weapon & Shield) does not increase this bonus. It has an encumbrance of 1 stone, or 2 stone if strapped on the front. The chief historical example is the Mycenean proto-dipylon shield and the Greek peltes.

###### Heater Shield

A heater is a heart-shaped shield measuring 2’ across the top and 3’ along its vertical axis. It is designed for both infantry and cavalry soldiers. A heater shield can be equipped in hand or strapped on the back to free up both hands. When equipped in hand by a dismounted character, a heater shield grants a +1 bonus to his Armor Class except when the character is vulnerable. When equipped in hand by a mounted character, a heater shield grants a +1 bonus to his *or* his mount’s Armor Class except when the character is surprised, retreating, or attacked from behind. The character can alternate between using the shield to protect himself or his mount each time he moves. When strapped on the back, a heater shield grants a +1 bonus to Armor Class when the character is attacked from behind. Fighting Style Specialization (Weapon & Shield) does not increase this bonus. However it is carried, a heater shield has an encumbrance of 1 stone. Historical examples include the Roman *parma* and various cavalry shields of Antiquity.

###### Kite Shield

A kite shield is a leaf- or almond-shaped shield, rounded on top and curving down to a point at the bottom. It measures 2.5’ across the top and 4’ to 5’ along its vertical axis. It is designed for cavalry. A dismounted character who has a kite shield equipped has his Armor Class increased by 1 point but suffers encumbrance of 2 stone. A mounted character who has a kite shield equipped has both his and his mount’s Armor Class increased by 1 point. The rider and the mount each suffer encumbrance of 1 stone. A kite shield cannot be strapped on the back. An equipped kite shield does not protect a character (or mount) that is vulnerable. The chief historical example is the Norman kite shield depicted in the Bayeux Tapestry.

###### Phalanx Shield

A phalanx shield is a curved dipylon, figure-eight, rectangular, or round shield. Dipylon, figure-eight, and rectangular shields measure 2.75’ wide and 3.5’ tall, while round shields measure 3’ in diameter, with all weighing around 22 lbs. Despite the weight, its shape and straps make it easy to carry and wield with one arm. A phalanx shield cannot be used by a mounted character. A dismounted character who has a phalanx shield equipped has his Armor Class increased by 1 point but suffers an encumbrance of 1 stone. He is considered to have a shield for purposes of the Defend action. A phalanx shield cannot be strapped on the back. A phalanx shield does not protect a character that is vulnerable. Historical examples include the Greek *aspis,* the Roman *scutum,* the Mycenean figure-eight shield, and the Achaean dipylon shield.

| Phalanx | +1 AC to wearer  +1 st enc. to wearer  Can use Specialization | Not permitted | Not permitted | Not permitted | Yes |

###### Troop Types by Shield

In the Auran Empire campaign setting, heavy infantry with shields will be carrying phalanx type; crossbowmen, light infantry, slingers, with shields will be carrying auxiliary or crescent type; and cavalry equipped with shields will be carrying auxiliary, crescent, or heater shields. Heavy infantry with polearms might be equipped with crescent shields strapped to front, with one step lighter armor, e.g. instead of banded plate and polearm, they might be equipped with laminated linen armor, crescent shield, and polearm.

## Slavery

Slavery was an all too common feature in ancient societies. Slaves might be indentured debtors, convicted criminals, or prisoners of war. The abundant supply of slave labor was a major component to most ancient economies, and the mass enslavement of defeated peoples was justified as more merciful than the alternative of slaughtering them. Neither ancient warfare nor ancient piracy can be economically understood without an understanding of the role of slaver.

That said, the existence of slavery in any given campaign setting or realm is ultimately at your discretion. The inclusion of rules for slaves is not intended to justify or condone the real-world practice of slavery itself. Should you wish to incorporate slavery into your campaign, use the following rules.

### Common Slaves

Most slaves belong to one of four types: slave laborers, household slaves, pleasure slaves, and professional slaves. To determine the market demand and supply of noncombatant slaves, consult the Hireling Availability by Market Class table. Whenever slaves are available for purchase, they will displace hirelings to a greater or lesser degree. Depending on how widespread their use is, slaves will replace 10% to 90% of the hirelings available in the market or realm.

#### Slave Laborers

Slave laborers do manual work, usually of the most unpleasant sort, such as farming on plantations, mining ore, or building pyramids. Slave laborers can be bought in markets at a cost of 40gp each. Slave laborers are generally able-bodied males captured in war or slaving expeditions. Individually, slave laborers can be used for any labor-related tasks. They cost 2gp each per month in upkeep and have base loyalty scores of -4.

When used on construction projects, treat each slave as an unskilled laborer with a construction rate of 1sp per day. When used to populate domains, treat every 3 slave laborers as equivalent to one peasant family for all purposes. If a domain’s population consists of 25% or more slave laborers, its domain morale is decreased by 1. If a domain’s population consists of 50% or more slave laborers, its domain morale is decreased by 2. If the domain is 100% slave labor, domain morale is decreased by 4. Historical examples include the helots of Sparta and the plantation slaves of Rome.

#### Household Slaves

Household slavesperform domestic chores such as cleaning, cooking, shopping, etc. Household slaves tend to live and work for their owners for long periods of time, and can be fairly loyal if treated well (base loyalty scores of -2). Historical examples include Greek and Roman household slaves. Household slaves can be bought in markets at a cost of 100gp each, and cost 3gp per month in upkeep. Better wages or working conditions can increase loyalty (Judge’s discretion).

#### Pleasure Slaves

Pleasure slavesare young and attractive slaves specially trained in the arts of seduction, performance, and pleasure. Historical examples include the Greek hetaera(courtesan) and Ottoman odalisque (harem slaves). Pleasure slaves usually have ranks in proficiencies such as Seduction, Performance (dance), and Labor (massage).

Pleasure slaves can be bought in markets at a cost of 100gp to 1,000gp, depending on age, beauty, and level of training. Truly exceptional pleasure slaves can command virtually unlimited prices. Pleasure slaves cost 12gp or more per month in upkeep. Pleasure slaves have base morale scores of -2. Kind treatment, gifts, or extended liberties can increase loyalty (Judge’s discretion).

#### Professional Slaves

Professional slavesare trained experts such as scribes, tutors, or accountants. In general, the cost of a professional slave is equal to 33 times a free professional’s wages per month, less 36gp. All professional slaves cost 3gp per month in upkeep. They have base loyalty scores of -2. Better working conditions, kind treatment, gifts, or extended liberties can increase morale (Judge’s discretion).

EXAMPLE A master blacksmith earns 75gp per month. Purchasing a master blacksmith slave therefore costs [(75 x 33) – 36] = 2,439gp.

### Soldier Slaves

Some realms may rely partly or exclusively on slave soldiers to man their armies. Such realms are usually rare. While slavery was very common in ancient societies, slave soldiers were not. Most slaveholders saw armed slaves as a threat to the social order. Even in societies where they did exist, historical slave soldiers such as the Persian ghulam, Egyptian mamelukes, and Turkish janissaries were usually either born into slavery or enslaved in early childhood so they could be indoctrinated with loyalty to the ruler. However, slave soldiers are more common in fantasy fiction, especially in darker works.

#### Availability of Slave Soldiers

To determine the availability of slave soldiers, consult the Mercenary Availability by Market Class and Mercenary Availability by Realm Size tables. Whenever slave soldiers are available for purchase, they will displace mercenaries to a greater or lesser degree. Depending on how widespread their use is, slave soldiers will replace 10% to 90% of the mercenaries available in the market or realm. Unlike mercenaries, slave soldiers need not be of the prevailing race of the settlement or realm. Weaker, faster-breeding, or simply “different” races might replace native-born troops.

EXAMPLE: Memet Mehtep, ruler of a principality of Kemesh, wishes to buy slave soldiers. Specifically, Memet Mehtep wants camel lancers to guard his sandy southern frontier. In Kemesh, slave soldiers have displaced 50% of the mercenaries. 130 camel lancer mercenaries are normally available in a principality, so there will be 65 camel lancer mercenaries and 65 camel lancer slaves. These slave soldiers are not actually Kemeshi, but are actually Besherab nomads captured as youths.

#### Buying Slave Soldiers

Finding and buying slave soldiers has the same time requirements, and gp cost per time period, as recruiting mercenaries. Instead of being hired for a wage, however, slave soldiers are purchased at a variable cost depending on their race, training and equipment. See the Slave Troop Type table below.

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | **Gp Cost per Slave** | | | | | | | | | | |

| Beast Rider | - | - | - | - | 3,825 | 4,875 | - | - | - | - | - |

**Upkeep:** Once hired, slave soldiers cost 3gp per month in upkeep (ogres cost 16gp per month in upkeep). Failure to pay upkeep counts as a calamity for morale purposes. Supplemental pay, better food, access to women, and so on can increase morale over time.

**Mercenary Slave Soldiers:** At the Judge’s discretion, slave soldiers might be hired from their owner rather than purchased outright. In this case, the slave soldiers would have a monthly cost equal to the standard wage for their troop type, but the funds would be paid to the owner rather than the slaves.

#### Training Slave Soldiers

Realm leaders with sufficient patience may conscript, capture, or purchase promising candidates and train them to become slave soldiers. To be amenable for training, candidates must be able-bodied creatures no older than their race’s Youth age category: 12 to 15 years old for beastmen, 13 to 17 years old for humans, etc. (See ***ACKS II Revised Rulebook***p. XXX for Character Aging categories).

The readiest source of candidates is the ruler’s realm itself. In Chaotic societies, one candidate of the appropriate age per 10 peasant families can be enslaved without impacting domain morale or domain revenue. Enslaving additional candidates has the same detrimental effect on domain morale and revenue as levying militia. Enslaving families is not permitted in Lawful or Neutral realms; doing so changes the alignment of the realm!

Candidates can also be acquired in war.25% of captives taken when pillaging a domain will be suitable (in age, temperament, and physique) to become slave soldiers.

Finally, candidates can be purchased in the market at a cost of 40gp each. See the Equipment Availability by Market Class table (p. XX) to determine the number available. If the number of candidates available is too few to meet demand, up to 10 times as many candidates can be “commissioned.” This represents hiring slavers to abduct likely candidates, and takes 40 days (1 day per gp).

Once they are acquired, the enslaved youth require a five-year period of indoctrination and discipline. This costs 180gp in upkeep per candidate. One marshal (30gp per month) is required per 60 candidates to oversee this process. After their five years of indoctrination, the slave soldiers can be assigned and trained to their specific troop type using the rules for Conscripts, above.

EXAMPLE: Memet Mehtep has just pillaged the oasis of Al-Danya, capturing 240 prisoners. 60 (25%) of these captives have the right age, temperament, and physique to become slave soldiers. These youths are placed under a marshal and indoctrinated for the next five years. This costs Memet Mehtep (60 x 180) 10,800gp in upkeep for the candidates and (30 x 12 x 5) 1,800gp for the marshal. At the end of five years, the slave soldiers can be trained as, e.g., light infantry or heavy cavalry, according to the standard rules.

#### Slave Morale

Slave soldiers enslaved as adults have loyalty scores of -4 (and are a very bad idea). Slave soldiers enslaved as children have the same morale scores as normal mercenaries of their type. They receive a permanent +1 bonus to their loyalty score provided they remain in the service of the leader who trained them. This bonus is lost if the slave soldiers are sold or hired out.

Slave soldiers make loyalty rolls as conscripts. Like conscripts, slave soldiers cannot voluntarily leave their leader’s service, but may desert, betray, or attack the leader.

**Mother of Dragons Memorial Rule:** If freed by a buyer (not their enslaver), slave soldiers immediately make a loyalty roll modified by their liberator’s Charisma. If the result is “Fanatic Loyalty,” the slave soldiers become liberator-worshipping fanatics who need only be paid their basic upkeep (3gp per month), and have a base loyalty of +4 regardless of how they are equipped.

#### Exotic Slave Soldiers

From time to time, characters might purchase, capture, **bewitch** otherwise enslave exotic creatures. The availability of such creatures as slaves is strictly at the Judge’s discretion. In general, exotic slaves should be very rare.

The purchase prices listed are for tamed and trained creatures. Exotic slaves, like other slave soldiers, need not be paid a wage. Supply and specialist costs must still be paid, however. Sapient exotics are only reliable if captured while young and raised in captivity. Exotic creatures of sapient intelligence captured as adults might serve out of honor, fear, or self-preservation, but they must make a loyalty roll each time they have the opportunity to escape or betray their master. If the monster’s morale is +1 or more, apply the creature’s normal morale bonus as a *penalty* to any loyalty rolls. If the monster’s morale is 0 or less, apply a -1 penalty to any loyalty rolls.

EXAMPLE: A manticore, captured as a baby and raised in captivity costs 30,500gp. It does not have to make a loyalty roll when presented with the opportunity to escape or betray its owner. A manticore captured as an adult is only worth 945gp. If purchased, its loyalty will be highly questionable. Any time it has an opportunity to escape or betray its master, it must make a loyalty roll at -1.

## Terrain Transformation

Throughout human history, agricultural and pastoral activities have transformed the landscapes we live in. The timeline for such transformations is decades to centuries, and so such outcomes are irrelevant to most ***ACKS II***campaigns. However, some Judges enjoy running “dynastic” campaigns that do encompass scores or hundreds of years. Other Judges like to take such effects into account when building their campaign setting – laying down forests and swamps as they existed before human intervention and then mapping the action of mankind onto it.

Therefore we offer the following optional rules for the transformation of terrain over time. As shown on the Terrain Transformation table, as the population increases in a 6-mile hex, the type of terrain changes. In the game world, the various land improvements and agricultural investments made by the realm ruler, along with the activities of the population itself, cause this change. For instance, deserts are irrigated and cultivated; swamps are dredged; hills are terraced for easier farming; and forests are cut down or burned.

The transformation in the game world is obviously gradual but for mechanical purposes it occurs in the month when the new population threshold is reached. When the transformation occurs, the demand modifiers for any urban settlement in that hex might change; see p. XX for rules on how terrain effects demand modifiers.

Only human, halfling, and humanoid (beastman) families cause terrain transformation. Dwarven, gnomish, and elven families do not – or at least they transform the land differently. For instance, dwarves mining using the rules in ***By This Axe*** despoil the land, causing both terrain transformation as well as reduction in land value.

**Designer’s Note:** Judges who… luxuriate in detail… might of course, divide the 6-mile hex into 1.5-mile hexes, use population thresholds of 1-12, 13-20, and 21+ families per 1.5-mile hex, and apply the transformations proportionately. For the record Autarch is not suggesting you should do this. Just because you could do something with the rules doesn’t mean we expect you to!

# PART V: APPENDICES

# Appendix A: Adventures [Add Files Separately]

In this Appendix we present nine one-page dungeon scenarios for use in your campaigns. The first three dungeons are for low-level adventurer-tier characters; the second three are for mid-level conqueror-tier characters; and the final three are for high-level king-tier characters. All nine are designed for use with the Auran Empire campaign setting, but should be easy to adapt to your own game world. You can start playing ***ACKS II***instantly by letting your players pick characters from an adventure party from Appendix P and running through one of these scenarios.

# Appendix C: Cosmology

As a general design principle, ***ACKS II***holds that game mechanics should always be justified by, or at least compatible with, the underlying reality of a coherent game world. Some of the mechanics of ***ACKS II***have profound implications for what that underlying reality must be. Game mechanics such as arcane and divine magic; divine power; sacrifice and congregants; reincarnation and resurrection – all demand an explanation or explanations.

Accordingly this section includes a complete and self-consistent metaphysical system that offers in-world explanations for the mysterious phenomenon implied by ***ACKS II***’sgame mechanics. It is, in other words, the implied metaphysicsof the Auran Empire campaign setting.

There are, of course, many possible explanations to things such as reincarnation and undeath, including the possibility of providing no explanation at all (“it’s a great mystery”). The answers below are merely one set of possible explanations. As Judge, it is your prerogative to change or ignore any of them; but even if your intent is to create your own metaphysical explanations, we feel confident that it’s easier to be creative when there’s an established framework to compare and contrast against.

The metaphysical explanations below are provided in a question-and-answer format. This is both for ease of reading and reference, and also because it is the most likely means for such explanations to arise in play – as adventurers like to ask difficult questions. Note that in many cases, the answers below reveal that the mythology and history of Cybele presented in earlier chapters is somewhere between “true from a certain point of view” to “outright false”.

## What is the Cosmos?

The Cosmos is a hyperdimensional space within which float the various Spheres of Existence. The inhabitants of Cybele know of seven Spheres: The Celestial Sphere, the Empyrean Sphere, the Chthonic Sphere, and the Elemental Spheres of Fire, Earth, Air, and Water. Beyond and between these Spheres is the Outer Darkness. All of this is true, as far as it goes; but it is not the complete truth.

The Celestial Sphere that holds the world of Cybele is not the onlycelestial sphere; it is merely one of many such spheres floating within theinfinite plenitude of the Cosmos. The Cosmos is not just vaster than the inhabitants of Cybele can comprehend; it is vaster than even the *gods* can comprehend, for it was not created by them.

## Who Created the Cosmos?

The true creator of the Cosmos was an omni-conscious entity that is as remote from the gods as the gods are remote from mortal men. The certainty of this entity’s existence is known only to the gods themselves, though the possibility of such a being has been theorized by Cybele’s wisest and most enlightened sages and philosophers. These scholars have given the cosmic creator many names: the Absolute, the Godhead, the Precursor, the Source, and the Unmoved Mover. The gods themselves call their creator **the Cosmarch**.

Whatever the entity’s name, its creation of the Cosmos was its first and last deed: In the generative act, the Cosmarch transferred all of its divine power into the Cosmos itself and became immanent within it. After creating the Cosmos, the Cosmarch was no longer an entity per se; but everything in the Cosmos had a trace of the Cosmarch within it. Living things have more than a trace; they have a veritable shard of the Cosmarch in them. This shard is called the **soul** and carries a measure of divine power. The collective sum of all these shards and traces of divine power immanent in the Cosmos is called **the Logos** or **divine power**.

**Historical Note:** The metaphysics of the Auran Empire setting are based primarily (but not exclusively) on philosophical and spiritual beliefs espoused during the Hellenistic era within Mediterranean, Near Eastern, and Indian realms. The primary inspiration is Stoicism. In Stoic cosmogony, God, which is both Nature and Reason, created and became the cosmos. All matter carries within it a fragment of the soul of God (also called the world-soul, *anima mundi*, or *logos*). In living creatures, this fragment of God is what endows them with locomotion, perception, and reason.

## What are the Gods?

Gods are immortal entities possessed of exceptional amounts of divine power. There are countless gods extant within the Cosmos. The most powerful of them can do almost anything they will; the least powerful are minor spirits or demons, weaker than the mightiest mortals. But not even the mightiest gods are all-knowing, all-powerful, or all-wise. The gods aren’t even sure what their purpose in the Cosmos is.

**Historical Note:** Despite believing in a creator god, Stoicism (and its contemporary rival Neo-Platonism) were polytheistic. Both philosophies taught that the world was peopled with divine agencies who possessed souls even more rarified and pure than that of man.

After aeons spent pondering the higher mysteries, the gods have broken into three different theological factions, each with a unique view as to the intended function of the Cosmos.

The first faction of gods believes that the Cosmarch sought to rid itself of evil – “to separate the light from the darkness,” according to the Seven Radiant Scrolls. They divide the Cosmos into good and evil, order and entropy, life and unlife. Acknowledging that all things came from the Cosmarch, they are moved by their shards of the world-soul to struggle on behalf of good, order, and life to purge evil, entropy, and unlife. The Empyrean gods of the Auran Empire belong to this faction. They are associated with the Lawful alignment.

The second faction of gods believe that the Cosmarch sought to rid itself, not of evil, but of weakness – “to separate the wheat from the chaff.” They divide the Cosmos into strong and weak, powerful and servile, free willed and enslaved. Their shards of the world-soul imbue them with a will to power and conquest. The Chthonic gods of the Zaharans belong to this faction. They are associated with the Chaotic alignment.

The third faction of gods believe that the Cosmarch sought to experience a richness of existence denied it as an Unmoved Mover. Love, hate, pleasure, pain, birth, death, all of these were contained within the Cosmarch but could not be perceived as such unless the Cosmarch became Many from One. The shamans of Skysostan, Jutland, and the Ivory Kingdom hold views similar to these. They are associated with the Neutral alignment. They believe that the other two factions, while necessary, simply misunderstand the role they are intended to play.

All three factions agree that at some point in the future, when the cosmic purpose is fulfilled, the Logos will re-absorbed and the Cosmarch will be reborn – a moment they call the Rebirth. But how the Rebirth will occur is a great mystery.

The Lawful faction of gods believes that the Rebirth will occur through the transmigration of souls (discussed below). As the wheel of birth and death revolves, each soul gradually ascends to a spiritually purer form, ready to rejoin the Cosmarch. All purified souls will eventually be re-united in apotheosis into the Cosmarch but in re-uniting will retain their individuality, becoming “many persons in one being.” The gods of this faction see themselves as stewards responsible for overseeing the Cosmos and safeguarding it and its inhabitants until this time of ordered reunion.

The Chaotic faction of gods takes a diametrically opposed position. These malign entities believe that only a small number of beings, perhaps even just one, will participate in the apotheosis of the Cosmarch. Just as the generation of the Cosmos demanded the willful dissolution of the Cosmarch’ divine power, so the regeneration of the Cosmarch will necessarily demand the willful consolidation of divine power. To this end, these implacable gods reap the souls of sentient creatures like men reap grain.

The Neutral gods see the ontological struggle itself to be the means by which the Cosmarch will be Reborn. When the Cosmarch has experienced all there is to experience, then Rebirth shall follow.

**Historical Note:** According to the Stoics, the cosmos will end in a great conflagration called *ekpyrôsis* in which everything will be re-absorbed by God. The *ekpyrôsis* would occur when the stars had returned to their original celestial positions.

## What are Souls?

Souls are the shards of the Logos that reside in every living creature. Each carries a measure of divine power. The transmigration of souls is the process by which immortal souls transition to new bodies. The ability of the Logos to reside in matter is dependent on the matter’s configuration and properties - its **form**in classical parlance. Death results when the physical form becomes so damaged or decrepit that it can no longer contain a complete soul. What happens next is a point of disagreement among the gods and theologians of the Cosmos.

The Lawful gods teach that when a body dies, its soul is judged by the Logos. A soul judged worthy become **exalted**or deified, ascending to become a spiritual being of great power. Exalted beings are often worshipped as deified emperors, demigods, angels, and saints by the mortals of their Sphere.

A soul that does not become exalted instead transmigrates to a new form which can contain it. This process is called **reincarnation** or **metempsychosis**. Reincarnation does not occur immediately. When a living creature dies, a residue of its soul will remain coagulate within the body for a time, only gradually dissipating from its corpse. How much of a residual soul remains depends in large part on how intact the body is – the more intact the body, the more residue of the soul will remain. It is this residue of the soul that makes creature parts valuable as special components. It is this residue of the soul that a spellcaster speaks with when using *speak with dead*. It is this residue that seeps into the ground in places of death to create sinkholes of evil (see below).

The residual soul is also why it is easier for a crusader using *restore life and limb*to bring back the soul of a creature which has recently died and whose corpse is mostly intact. One of the reasons that the Empyrean faith teaches its clergy to cremate the dead is to help free the residual soul to move on to its next incarnation.

On the soul is reincarnated, it loses access to the memory of any prior lives it lived. Nevertheless, the Lawful gods teach that the soul retains its unique individuality; and the memories are not lost, merely hidden. A soul that becomes exalted can hope to regain all the memories of all its prior lives.

The Chaotic gods offer a very different theology. They teach that when a body dies, its soul is not so much reincarnated as recycled*:* The souls of the dead are blended together like lumps of ore in a furnace melted into slag, only to be smelted back into individual ingots. The newborn soul does not retain access to the memory of its prior life because it did not even have one particular prior life; it’s a composite of many souls blended together. As such, reincarnation means the loss of a soul’s particular individuality forever. In death and rebirth there is neither justice nor karma, merely absorption and reconfiguration. The Chaotic gods believe that exalted souls are just a form of undead (see below) and that the so-called individual memories regained by exalted souls are just a confused jumble of memories from many individual beings.

The Neutral gods argue that the distinctions that the Lawful and Chaotic gods cling to are illusory. Since all souls are simply aspects of the Cosmarch or world-soul, individuality itself is an illusion. All souls come from the Cosmarch and all souls return to the Cosmarch; all thoughts are of the Cosmarch and remembered by it.

Each of these theologies is internally consistent and unfalsifiable. Neither magic nor philosophy has been able to ascertain which is true, if such a question is even meaningful. Whatever the case, all three factions agree that as shards of the Logos, souls can neither be created nor destroyed, merely transformed or subsumed. And all three agree that when a soul is involuntarily absorbed by another more powerful soul, as occurs when a Chaotic crusader sacrifices a creature to his god, it is effectively destroyed as an individual. Lawful theologians find this abhorrent, of course, while Chaotic theologians see it as the virtuous process by which the strong grow stronger.

**Historical Note:** Reincarnation is nowadays thought of as an “Eastern” belief. But the transmigration of the soul was known to the ancient Greeks as *metempsychosis* as early as the 6th century B.C. It was espoused by Pythagoras and through him Plato (in ***The*** *Myth of Er*). It was central to the Orphic mystery religion, to Plotinus and the Neo-Platonists, and to the Greco-Egyptian wisdom texts called the *Hermetica*. It also dominated the teachings of the Celtic druids.

## What is Undeath?

The Lawful gods believe that undeath is a corruption of the natural order that the Lawful gods are relying on to achieve their version of the Rebirth. Undeath blocks the natural process of reincarnation from occurring. Lawful societies are taught to prevent undeath from occurring, and to destroy it wherever it arises.

The Chaotic gods believe that undeath is an overcoming of flesh and a victory over death. It is the ultimate exercise of the will to power, when a soul refuses to obey even Nature’s Laws. Chaotic societies see undeath as the best means by which an individual soul can avoid melting away after death.

Undeath can arise from corrupting the natural order of either the body (form) or the soul, and the disruption can be spread from tainted creature to creature.

When the body of a living creature is corrupted, the soul within is trapped in the corrupted body upon its death. Ghouls, mummies, and vampires are examples of undead with corrupted bodies. Corrupted bodies are no longer truly alive and in the absence of magic or physical means of preservation, they rot. Ghouls magically maintain their bodies by feeding on the flesh of the living, vampires by feeding on their blood. Mummies do not feed, so great care is made to physically and magically preserve the body before undeath.

When the soul of a living creature becomes corrupted by undeath, the condition of the body is less important; the soul itself is unable to enter the cycle of reincarnation. Wights, wraiths, spectres, and vampires all have corrupted souls. Undead with corrupted souls are greatly feared, for they feed on the life-energy of living things, and whatever they drain away is filled by corruption. This is the basis for the much-feared enervation of such undead.

Based on the existence of incorporeal undead, the Chaotic gods believe that so-called exalted souls are simply incorporeal undead who have learned to feed on life energy given in worship. A Lawful priest claims that a deified emperor is worshipped because he is divine; a Chaotic cultist claims that a deified emperor is kept in a state of incorporeal undeath by worship. (The Chaotic cultists think this a good thing, of course, while their Lawful counterparts claim it as heresy and blasphemy.)

Since the world itself is the Logos or Cosmarch made immanent, it is possible for entire regions of the world to be as corrupted as an individual body by undeath. Such areas are known as **sinkholes of evil***.* In such sinkholes, the corruption may leak into corpses within, causing them to animate as skeletons and zombies. Similarly, magical animation of the dead functions by extracting tainted shards of the Logos from the environment and imbuing it into corpses. Skeletons and zombies are insentient, then, because the traces of Logos which animate them are not the soul of their original inhabitants but rather spiritual slag in nearby matter.

Places of death tend to become sinkholes of evil when the spiritual residue in corpses lingers in the environment and spreads back into the decaying corpses. By cremating the dead, the Empyrean faith keeps its places of dead clear of such pollution.

## What are the Celestial Spheres?

The celestial spheres are pocket universes created by the Lawful gods as strongholds to protect living creatures from the predations of Chaotic gods. Within them, huge populations of mortals are able to flourish in relative safety. The Lawful gods periodically gather in pantheons and construct these pocket universes using substances drawn from the Elemental Spheres of Water, Air, Fire, and Earth, manipulated by their own raw divine power.

After they fasten a celestial sphere, the gods introduce a variety of ensouled life forms on it, their forms drawn from successful archetypes such as men, elves, dwarves, and dragons. To make them harder to find and destroy, the spheres are set adrift through the Cosmos, eternally on the move.

**Designer’s Note:** Any fantasy campaign world can be placed within a celestial sphere. Each campaign world will have its own gods, who created the celestial sphere, and who occupy their own divine spheres. Particular physical and magical laws may vary depending on the decisions of the celestial sphere’s creators. Since the celestial spheres move over time, they may occasionally touch or overlap. This structure allows for adventures to travel to different campaign worlds while remaining within the Cosmos. It also allows the Judge to introduce travelers from other spheres into his campaign, or alien gods, strange artifacts, or anything else imagine.

## What are the Elemental Spheres?

The Elemental Spheres are reservoirs of matter and energy that drift within the Cosmos. Some of the gods believe that they are detritus of the Cosmarch accidental byproducts of the act of creation. Others believe that the Cosmarch specifically created the Elemental Spheres as a source for the gods to tap, or from which it might one day reconstruct itself. Whatever the truth, the gods manipulate the substances of the Elemental Spheres to forge new spheres of existence; and both gods and men call on them as a source when they cast spells.

Much of each Elemental Sphere’s substance is animate, with the Logos thickly concentrated within it even though the form is not that of a living creature. When this animate substance is summoned to another sphere of existence, it temporarily becomes an independent entity called an elemental. When animate elemental substance is permanently fastened into the shapes of men or beasts, it becomes an elemental creature such as a djinni, efreeti, hell hound, or salamander. Many such creatures were created in past eras as servitors and soldiers of the gods.

Such acts are rarer now, for over aeons of use by gods and men, the Elemental Spheres have gradually diminished in size. This has made the greatest acts of creation increasingly harder to accomplish, forcing the gods to accumulate ever greater levels of divine power to continue their works.

## Is there a Primary Sphere?

There was, once. The Prime Sphere was a celestial sphere created by the Logos itself, a sphere of such enormous extent that it almost defied being termed a sphere at all. Unlike Cybele’s sphere, which holds but a single sun, the Prime Sphere carried over 70 sextillion stars. Some say that the gods of the Cosmos were birthed on this sphere, evolving from primitive lifeforms into higher entities over countless billions of years.

But the Prime Sphere was destroyed long ago in a terrible war between the Lawful and Chaotic gods in which the lives of countless trillions of mortal and divine beings were extinguished. It exists now only in the memories of the surviving gods. The Empyrean gods honor their ancestral home each time they create a pocket universe: The creatures and civilizational models they employ are all, in one way or another, descended from those of the Primary Sphere.

**Designer’s Note:** The intent here is that the Primary Sphere was our own real-world universe. It explains why so many fantasy RPGcampaign worlds are filled with creatures and cultures that resemble those from Earth’s history and mythology – it’s because the gods originated in our Primary Sphere. This assumption thus sets all ***ACKS***campaigns in our reality’s future (insofar as we know, our universe hasn’t been destroyed in a divine war). But it’s really up to the Judge. For instance, he could rule that our real-world universe is actually a partial copy of the destroyed Prime, one in which the distant galaxies are a clever *trompe l'oeil.* Or he could assume that the Primary Sphere is still in existence, and allow his ***ACKS***adventurers to visit Earth and explore our real galaxies and planets.

## How do the Gods accumulate Divine Power?

As the Logos was once the Cosmarch, it is the nature of the Logos to seek reunification with itself; thus divine power flows easily from one creature to another, especially from a creature with less divine power to a creature with more. Worship, a voluntary act of will, can bequeath a measure of the worshipper’s divine power to the focus of his worship. Worship never bequeaths anywhere near the total of the worshipper’s divine power, merely a tiny, surplus portion created by the creature’s continued existence.

Much more divine power can be garnered by sacrificing a creature. The creature’s death releases all of its divine power at once, which the sacrificier channels to the worshipped god. The god, in turn, usually rewards the sacrificier by returning a fraction of the divine power it received. Sacrifice utterly consumes the creature’s soul, removing it from the cycle of reincarnation and denying it the future opportunity for direct reunification with the Logos.

Chaotic gods prefer to acquire divine power from the sacrifice of living creatures. Reaping the life force directly is faster, and also is brutally effective in when a new population of living creatures comes under their power. But widespread blood sacrifice is inimical to life flourishing, and the brutal practice generally results in the rapid collapse of populations under the sway of Chaotic gods.

Lawful gods prefer to harvest only a fraction of their worshipper’s divine power, and even devote some of their own incalculable energies towards assisting their leading emissaries. This practice has proved so successful that in some Spheres, the Chaotic gods have begrudgingly begun to copy the Lawful gods’ tactics and send missionaries amongst mortals to establish their worship.

The accumulation of divine power is not inherently limited to the gods. A mortal creature whose soul receives enough divine power through worship and sacrifice can become a god of the weakest sort, what might be called a god-king, godling, or demi-god, and even if the body dies it can maintain its existence. Exalted souls may actually be examples of this process. Usually such souls pledge themselves to more powerful entities in a form of deific feudalism. Others seek to be independent, but this is risky. If a godling maintains a low profile and limits itself to local affairs, it may be able to flourish, but would-be deities who seek greater power are not usually viewed kindly by the extant gods or their mortal worshippers. A rare few succeed in ascending to the pantheon of powers, but most are destroyed and their divine power seized by greater deities.

## Game Mechanics of Divine Power

The idea that the gods gain something from worship and sacrifice was implicit in the syncretic Greco-Roman religions. Worship was an act of propitiation, expressed in the formula *do ut des* (“I give that you might give”): The gods were expected to reward acts of worship with blessings, gifts, victories, and so on.

*Do ut des* is the basis for the mechanics of divine power detailed in the ***ACKS II******Revised Rulebook***. While the rules discuss divine power in the context of divine magic, all magic is, in effect, an application of divine power. The difference between arcane and divine magic is that mages use their personal power to manipulate sources immanent within the world, while crusaders use their personal power to channel divine sources.

### Divine Power of Creatures

The total amount of divine power possessed by a creature is equal to ten times its XP value. When a creature dies, about 90% of this value rapidly transmigrates; the other 10% remains as a residue within the creature’s blood or organs, which can be harvested as special components for magical research. When a creature is sacrificed, 80% of its divine power passes to the entity worshipped, 10% is retained by the sacrificier for his own ends, and 10% remains residual within its blood and organs. This why XP value = special component value = sacrifice value.

A living creature will generate excess divine power each day equal to 6% of its XP value. Casters use caster level instead of HD for this determination and add one \* for partial progression and \*\* for full progression. For example, a 14th level mage counts as a HD 14\*\* creature (worth 3,800XP); he therefore has (3,800 x 6%) about 230 points of divine power available. Casters use some of this to fuel their spells (a 14th level mage’s spells cost about 190 divine power). The rest is dissipated or bequeathed to a god through worship. (As with sacrifice, a crusader that leads a congregant in worship collects 10% while the god collects the rest). Once expended, the creature’s divine power will recharge through food and drink.

### The Cost of Spells

For Judges who, like Pythagoras, believe that numbers constitute the true nature of things, here are the actual costs in divine power to cast each level of spell in ***ACKS***:

1st: 1 / 5 4th: 10 / 50

2nd: 3 / 15 5th: 15 / 75

3rd: 6 / 30 6th: 21 / 105

The number before the slash is how much of his own divine power the spellcaster must expend to channel the spell’s magic, while the number after the slash represents the total divine power consumed to fuel the spell, drawn from the caster’s god or from immanent sources in the environment. (If the spellcaster is himself a god using arcane or divine power to cast, he must pay full cost.) 7th – 9th level spells can only be cast by rituals with much higher costs.

Note that spell point costs for spells (found in the ***Heroic Fantasy Handbook***) are actually the cost in divine power divided by 2 and rounded off into a smooth progression. Hence 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, and 21 became 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 10.

Creating magical items (including the components to cast ritual magic) requires additional divine power to transform the materials used into a form which can hold and sustain the magic. This extra divine power is sourced from special components, sacrifice, etc.

### Divine Power of the Gods

How much divine power do the gods have access to? Gods gain divine power from two sources, sacrifice and worship.

From the ***ACKS II Revised Rulebook****,* we know that sacrificing a peasant worth 5 XP to a god will yield 5 points of divine power to the sacrificier. Since the sacrificier gets 10% and the god gets 80%, the sacrifice must get 40 points to the god. Sacrificing 50 peasants will yield 2,000 points of divine power.

That same peasant, if kept alive, will produce a surplus of (5 XP x 0.06 DP/XP) = 3 divine power per day or 21 divine power per week. 50 such peasants will produce 110 divine power per week. If the peasants were utterly faithful, 90% of this would go to their god and 10% would go to the divine spellcaster who organized their congregation. That’s 99 for the god and 11 for the caster. That tracks with the ***ACKS II******Revised Rulebook***, where every fifty congregants earns the caster 10gp worth of divine power per week of faithful worship.

Of course, most divine casters don’t have that many utterly faithful congregants. Most are ministering to domains filled with somewhat-faithful peasants who yield the caster about 4 points of divine power per week. That means the caster’s god is getting 36 points of divine power per week from those 50 men (or about 0.7 points per worshipper).

Given its global population of about 150 million normal men, the world of Cybele yields around 108 million points of divine power per week. There are around 2.7 million crusaders in Cybele; fueling their spells costs about 80 million divine power per week. That leaves the gods with about 25% of their power available for other purposes.

### Apotheosis

How much divine power would a mortal have to accumulate to achieve godhood? For a deceased creature to maintain its soul requires excess divine power each day equal to 6% of its XP value or caster level (whichever is greater). Thus the 14th level mage whose body has died now requires 230 divine power per day just to sustain himself, which works out to 1,610 divine power per week. At 0.7 divine power per worshipper per week, the apotheosizing character will need 2,300 worshippers to sustain himself.

What if the would-be god also wants to have divine magic? It costs 800 divine power to fuel a 14th level crusader for a single day, 5,600 to fuel him for a week. This would require about (800 divine power / 0.7 divine power per worshipper) 11,420 worshippers. It is thus conceivable that a deified priest-king of a city-state who persuaded his subjects to worship him could cast divine magic powered by his own worship.

That priest-king is not really a god, of course, merely a crusader of his own faith. To be a powerful polytheistic god, for example one that could cast 6th level spellsevery round, how many worshippers would be required? Being able to cast a 6th level spellevery round for a week would cost (126 divine power x 60 rounds/hour x 24 hours/day x 7 days/week) 1,270,080 divine power per week. That would require (1,270,080 / 0.7) 1,814,400 worshippers. That is not inconceivable for a powerful god-emperor, but he who dares to try will face challenges from the existing gods and clerics of the world.

To be a nigh-almighty being that could cast *wish* every round would require much more: 200,000 divine power x 60 rounds/hour x 24 hours/day x 7 days/week) = 2,016,000,000 divine power per week. That would require 2.88 billion worshippers, far more than the population of Cybele. None of the gods of Cybele are omnipotent.

# Appendix E: Economics

Since its release, ***ACKS***has been praised for its coherent economic system. Whereas in most fantasy RPGs, the economy is essentially handwaved or ignored, ***ACKS***actually simulates market availability, mercantile exchange, and more. While we appreciated the praise, it was unexpected: ***ACKS***wasn’t actually built as an economic simulator. ***ACKS***was built as a multi-tiered simulation where players could enjoy both an individual-scale tabletop role-playing game and an army-scale tabletop wargame that used the same characters and rules. However, in order to simulate massive pitched battles realistically, we had to simulate the operations of armies in the field that lead to pitched battles; and in order to simulate the operations of armies in the field realistically, we had to simulate the logistical limitations that drove their operations; and in order to simulate the logistical limitations realistically, we had to know what those were – which meant we had to know how many troops could a province supply, how many swords, how much grain, and so on. In short, to have a deep simulation of conquest and kingship, we needed to have a deep simulation of agriculture and trade. This proved to be an invaluable benefit for the game and for ***ACKS***judges everywhere. In the years after ***ACKS***was released, we have substantially expanded, clarified, and improved its economic engine.

## Baseline Assumptions

The economy of ***ACKS*** was built from a small number of assumptions, the most crucial of which are (1) that an unskilled laborer earns around 1sp per day of work; (2) that a typical farm yields one quarter of grain per acre; (3) that one quarter of grain sells for 4gp; and (4) that risky investments will yield a rate of return of 3% per month.

The first three assumptions are grounded in history, and a more elaborate explanation of them can be found later in this appendix. They set the foundation for the wages and costs of everything else in the setting. Mankind’s caloric needs and unskilled labor productivity did not vary much within the timeframe ***ACKS***concerns itself, and so by adjusting for land productivity we could normalize a variety of historical prices for the game.

The fourth assumption actually *emerged* from the other three assumptions of the system; it wasn’t initially designed in. We have previously referred to it as “the secret ratio” of 1:33 (as 1 divided by 33 yields 0.03 or 3%). The first place the secret ratio appeared was in the average rate of return on gold invested per month in certain mercantile activities, which was 3%. But then it started appearing everywhere.

This ratio became very useful as it allowed us to work out the approximate "capital" of individuals with known income, or conversely, the approximate income of individuals with a known amount of capital. (Note that capital is loosely defined here -- a fighter who has spent thousands of gold carousing while bragging of his exploits has essentially "invested" in his reputation. We assumed for the sake of simplicity that coin, equipment, training, carousing, etc. all have an equal rate of return). Using the secret ratio, we can conclude that:

* A peasant, earning 3gp per month, probably has (3x33) 99gp in capital. This is probably seed, farming implements, and perhaps some domestic animals. It is by happy coincidence also very close to the average starting wealth of a PC.
* An alchemist, earning 75gp per month, probably has (75x33) 2,475gp in capital — lab equipment, books, chemical mixtures, potions, and coin.
* The emperor of a massive domain, with an income of 360,000gp per month, has capital of around 11,880,000gp.
* A warrior (2nd level fighter) with 1,500gp invested in equipment, training, and so on, would expect to earn 45gp per month (1500/33).

About 80% of experience points in **ACKS** are derived from gold, so it was easy to determine the capital of an NPC by multiplying his XP by 80%. That in turn enabled us to calculate the amount of money the character would expect to earn per month. This solved the age-old problem of "how much does it cost to hire an NPC of such-and-such level”.

Even better, since we knew the average income of various ranks of nobility, it also showed how the wages of characters of various levels compared against that of nobility. At 9th level a character's income from his skills suggested he should be earning as much as an earl or count — which, in turn, suggests that a 9th level warlord who has built a stronghold and carved out a domain can safely style himself as an earl or count.

Some reviewers who have encountered the secret ratio find the notion of a 3% per month interest rate absurd. But it wasn’t absurd historically – in fact, it wasn’t even uncommon! In some times and places, it was the default. For example:

* The average 1-year rate of profit on agricultural product during the 13th-14th centuries in England was 22.3% for wheat, 29.3% for barley, and 22.4% for oats ("Markets and Economic Growth: The Grain Market of Medieval England", Greg Clark, Department of Economics - UC Davis).
* In Old Babylonia, the interest rate on agricultural loans was 33 1/3%. ("How Interest Rates Were Set, 2500 BC - 1000 AD," Michael Hudson, *Journal of the Economic and Social History of the Orient* 43, Spring 2000).
* Mortgage lenders in pre-modern France typically required interest of 20-30% of the value of their loan and merchants paid as much as 5-8 % interest per *week* for working capital (*An Essay on Economic Theory*, Richard Cantillon).
* The rate of return on the silver trade between Rome and India during the Hellenistic era was 100%! (*The Middle Ages Revisited*, Alexander Del Mar).

Such exorbitant rates of profit and interest seem unbelievable to students of modern economics. How could such rates of profit and interest be sustained? Because of all these factors:

* Economic rents on land. Landlords had a monopoly on land and legal rights to force the workers to work the land. Labor was not a free market.
* Economic rents on commerce. Guild monopolies were common, as were royal charters.
* Grossly inefficient markets. Inefficient markets allow for higher rates of return than efficient markets, which arbitrage away high profits.
* Very short time preferences. When life is nasty, brutish, and short, there’s little incentive to save. That means that interest rates must be very high or actors will simply consume.
* Low capital accumulation. Revenues were consumed rather than capitalized, leading to high rates of profit but low rates of long-term growth.

From these four assumptions we erected the edifice of ***ACKS***’s economic system. The rest of this article fills in various gaps in the system that might arise in play.

## Agrarian Economics

By default, ***ACKS***assumes an agrarian economy where most peasants generate revenue by laboring on a “mixed” farm with both crops and livestock, producing wheat, barley, and other grains; milk, meat, wool, and other animal products; and various ancillary domestic goods such as ale, timber, clothing, and furniture. From the lord’s perspective, this is collected in the form of land value, service value, and tax value, typically totaling 12gp per family per month. But what’s going on at the level of the peasant family?

### Mixed Farms

A typical peasant family manages 30 acres, with 20 acres farmed and 10 acres fallow each year. Each year, each of the 20 farmed acres is seeded with 2 bushels of grain. Each farmed acre then yields 10 bushels of grain. 2 bushels must be set aside for next year’s seed, so the result is a 4:1 yield of (10 – 2) 8 bushels per acre, or 1 quarter per acre. Therefore, 20 acres yields 160 bushels or 20 quarters of grain. A quarter of grain costs 4gp in ***ACKS***. Therefore, the peasant’s farmland produces (20 acres x 1 quarter/acre x 4gp/quarter) 80gp per year.

In addition, the family manages 1 ox, 3 cows, 1 pig, and 32 sheep. Each ox and cow requires 1.33 acres of pasture. The pig requires no acreage, as it is fed from fallen nuts and farm refuse. One sheep may graze in each ox or cow’s acreage; the other sheep require 0.167 acres of pasture each. The peasant family therefore requires [(1 x 1.33) + (3 x 1.33) + ({32-4} x 0.167)] 10 acres of pasture for its livestock – the same 10 acres it leaves fallow each year.

The ox is used to plough the field, and its value is already represented by the yields noted above. The 3 cows produce 10.41gp of revenue each. The pig produces 1.14gp of revenue. The 32 sheep produce 1.58gp of revenue each. Total revenue for the field is therefore [(3 x 10.41) + (1 x 1.14) + (32 x 1.58) 82.93gp. For ease, we round to 83gp. (See the next section for details on how this was calculated.)

Across its members, a peasant family has 500 days of labor available. The family first attends to its crops and animals, then its garden, and thereafter performs unskilled labor for other purposes.

The labor of farming can be divided into plowing, reaping, harvesting, and threshing. Plowing an acre takes 1.1 days of labor, or 22 days for 20 acres. Reaping an acre requires 1.5 days, or 30 days for 20 acres. Harvesting an acre requires 1.4 days, or 28 days for 20 acres. Threshing 4 bushels requires 1 day, or 40 days for 160 bushels. In total, farming 20 acres requires (22 + 30 + 28 + 40) 120 days of labor, or about 6 days per acre.

The labor of animal husbandry is dependent on the livestock. Each cow requires 5 days of labor annually. Each pig requires 3 days of labor annually. Each sheep requires 1.33 days of labor annually. A farm with 3 cows, 1 pig, and 32 sheep uses [(3 x 5) + (1 x 3) + (32 x 1.33)] 60.56 days of labor, or about 6 days per acre.

The peasant family therefore has [500 – (120 + 60)] 320 days of labor available after tending to crops and animals. Unskilled labor is worth 1sp per day, so this yields an additional 32gp for the household.

The total value produced is 80gp from crops, 83gp from livestock, and 32gp from other labor, for a total of 195gp per year. With 12 months per year, the peasant family produces 16.25gp of crops, milk, wool, meat, and goods per month.

***ACKS***is agnostic with regard to whether any individual peasant family is an owner, renter, or serf of its land. The economic system simplyassumes that most of a peasant family’s production is extracted by landlords and tax collectors in some manner, such that the family is able to maintain only a subsistence lifestyle.

A peasant family requires a minimum of 11,000 calories per day, with 10,625 from bread and 375 from meat. A one-pound loaf of bread provides 1,000 calories per day. A bushel of wheat produces 72 one-pound loaves of bread. As each bushel costs (4gp/quarter / 8 bushels/quarter) 0.5gp, each loaf of bread costs 0.69cp. Therefore each family needs (10.625 x 0.69)7.33cp per day for bread. 375 calories of beef, pork, or milk costs (375 x 4/1000) = 1.5cp, so each family spent another 1.5cp per day. In total, the family needs 8.83cp per day, or 264.9cp per month, or 2.65gp.

Historically the cost of food represented at least 60% of total costs for a peasant household. Using this as a baseline, we can calculate that total subsistence consumption could not exceed 2.65gp/0.6, or 4.41gp per month. We shall set the value at 4.25gp per month. The peasant family consumes (4.25gp – 2.65gp) 1.6gp of goods other than food per month. In total it consumes (4.25gp/month x 12 months/year) 51gp per year.

If the family produces 16.25gp per month, and subsists on 4.25gp per month, then the monthly surplus remaining for landlords and tax collectors is 12gp. In ***ACKS II***, this is represented with the tax, service, and land values generated by each peasant family, which average 12gp per month for average land (land value 6gp). About 75% of the peasant’s production is thus claimed by the ruler.

Note that if the family were to abandon its farm to work as unskilled labor, it would have a full 500 days of labor available. The wages of unskilled labor are 1sp per day, so the family might hope to earn 500sp per year, but that is only 50gp per year or 4.16gp per month. Thus, even assuming full employment, a laborer family is worse off than a peasant family.

In most cases, the peasant family will enjoy an even higher standard of living, as the local lord returns a portion of his taxes and rents in the form of feasts and festivals. In ***ACKS***these are called liturgy expenses and are typically 1gp per month. The peasant family thus might consume as much as 5.25gp per month.

###### Return on Investment

Arable farmland can be purchased at 15gp per acre, so purchasing 30 acres costs 450gp. The cost of the livestock is another 71gp. Total investment is therefore 521gp. According to ***ACKS***secret ratio, that should yield 15.63gp per month or 187.6gp per year profit. At 144gp per year profit, mixed farming yields a rate of return of 27% annually, only 81% of the value predicted by the secret ratio. This is counterbalanced by the fact that mixed farming has the highest caloric return of any activity (see below). In order to seek returns, market forces will move as many peasants as possible to other types of farming, but this will be limited by the caloric needs of the population.

###### Caloric Return on Acreage

A mixed farm produces 20 quarters of wheat. Each quarter of wheat consists of 8 bushels, each of which produces 72 loaves of bread worth 1,000-calories each. Therefore, each quarter has (8 x 72 x 1,000) = 576,000 calories. That yields 11,520,000 wheat calories per farm. A mixed farm also produces 3,978 gallons of milk, each worth 2,400 calories per gallon, for another 952,800 calories. Finally, it produces 388 lbs of beef and mutton (1,000 calories per pound) and 38 pounds of pork (650 calories per pound), for another 388,000 and 24,523 calories respectively. Total caloric return is 12,884,823 calories per 30 acres, or 429,494 calories per acre. The peasant family consumes 4,015,000 calories per year. It is the surplus calories from mixed farming that enable all other types of economic activities in the setting.

### Olive Groves

A typical olive grove is 20 acres. Olive trees were planted with 25 feet between each tree, such that each tree had 625 square feet allocated to it. With 43,560 square feet per acre, that permits (43,560 / 625) = 70 trees per acre, for a total of 1,400 trees per olive grove. Each tree produces around 50 lbs of olives per year. It requires 5lbs of olives to produce 1 pint of olive oil.

Since 1 stone (15 lbs) of oil is worth 30cp, 1 pint of olive oil is worth 2cp. Therefore each tree generates (50 / 5 x 2) = 20cp worth of olive oil. The grove as a whole produces (1,400 x 0.2) = 280gp per year.

According to ancient sources, an olive grove needed between 1 laborer per 22 *iugera* and 1 laborer per 30 *iugera.* An *iugera* was about two-thirds of an acre, so the grove needs somewhere around 1 laborer per 14 to 20 acres. We assume 1 laborer per 20 acres, at 250 labor days per laborer. At 1sp per day of labor, the cost is 25gp per year. The profit for the olive grove is therefore (280 – 25) = 255gp per year.

###### Return on Investment

It then takes about 5 years for the trees planted on the land to begin to yield olives. During that time, an investor who invested in mixed farmland might earn 27% annually. Therefore, the net present value of the land on an olive grove is around (15gp x 1.275) or 49.6gp. We’ll round it to 50gp for simplicity. Therefore, the investment required to buy 20 acres of olive trees is (20 x 50) 1,000gp. With a profit of 255gp per year, the return is 25.5% per year, or about 77% of the secret ratio and a little less than mixed farming. Interestingly enough, Pliny the Elder in the *Natural History* says that it can be difficult to make a profit from olives.

###### Caloric Return on Acreage

A pint of olive oil has 3,840 calories. Since each of its 1,400 trees produces 10 pints of olive oil, the olive grove produces (1,400 x 10 x 3840) 53,760,000 calories per year. That works out to 2,6885,000 calories per acre. Olive groves thus exceed mixed farming in pure caloric productivity. However, they require a longer time horizon, offer a lower rate of return, and provide less nutritional diversity, with no protein or carbohydrates. Man cannot survive on olive oil alone, and his domesticated animals cannot survive on it at all.

### Vineyards

According to ancient sources, a typical vineyard is 7 *iugera* and produces 1.5 *culleus* of wine per *iugerum,* 10.5 *culleus* total. Each *iugera* is about 0.66 acres, so 7 *iugera* is 4.62 acres. Each *culleus* is a little over 138 gallons, so production is 314 gallons per acre or 1,449 gallons total.

Since 1 stone (15lbs) of wine is worth 19cp, 1 gallon of wine is worth (8.33 / 15 x 19) = 10.5cp, or 1sp. Therefore the vineyard produces wine worth (1449 x 0.1) = 145gp annually.

According to ancient sources, a vineyard needed between 1 laborer per 7 *iugera*. Since that’s the size of our vineyard, we need just 1 laborer for our vineyard. At 250 labor days per laborer and 1sp per day of labor, the cost is 25gp per year. The profit for the olive grove is therefore (145 – 25) = 120gp per year.

###### Return on Investment

Vine-land was a valuable investment in the ancient world, and most soils and climates were unsuitable. We price vine-land at 50gp per acre. Since 4.62 acres required, the cost of the vineyard’s land will cost 231gp. With a profit of 120gp per year, the return is 52% per year, or about 157% of the secret ratio. Vineyards are the most profitable agriculture venture.

###### Caloric Return on Acreage

A gallon of wine has 18,875 calories. Since the vineyard produces 1,449 gallons per year, the olive grove produces (1,449 x 18,875) 27,349,875 calories per year. That works out to 6,837,468 calories per acre. Vineyards considerably exceed mixed farming in pure caloric productivity. As with olive groves, however, the calories do not provide the right nutrients to keep a man alive, nor can they support the existence of domesticated animals.

## Pastoralist Economics

Calculating revenue from livestock is complicated by the fact that livestock are born, reproduce, and die. To address this dynamic, we developed the concept of an **equilibrium herd**. The equilibrium herd is a set of animals of sufficient size to maintain its numbers year over year while producing milk, meat, wool, and other goods at a stable level. By using an equilibrium herd, average revenue per animal can be calculated as the revenue produced by the equilibrium herd divided by the number of animals in the herd. Using an equilibrium also enables us to assess the return on investment in livestock.

Child-aged livestock have been priced at 50% of adult price, while adolescent livestock are at full price. Baby, child, and adolescent livestock have pelts and meat worth 25%, 50%, and 75% of the value of adult livestock, but adolescent males are treated as adult females due to dimorphism. Pasture is priced at 15gp per acre.

### Cattle Herds

An equilibrium herd consists of 16 cattle, including 8 adult cows, 2 heifers (adolescent female cows), 2 bullocks (adolescent male cows), 2 bull calves (child male cows), and 2 cow calves (child female cows). The adult cows have access to a bull (not included in the herd). Every year, the following occurs:

* Each head of cattle receives 5 days of labor costing 1sp per day, for a total of (16 x 5 x .1) 8gp.
* Each of the 16 heads of cattle grazes on 1.33 acres of pasture, for a total of 21.28 acres.
* Each of the 8 milk-cows has a 70% annual chance of giving birth to a calf, which has a 70% chance of surviving to mid-year. Therefore there are (8 x .7 x .7) 4 calves by mid-year, of which 2 are bull calves and 2 are cow calves.
* 6 of the milk cows produce 125 gallons of milk each. The 2 oldest milk cows and the 2 heifers produce 112.5 gallons of milk each. Total milk production is [(6 x 125) + (4 x 112.5)] 1,200 gallons. Milk is worth 1sp per gallon, so the herd produces 120gp worth of milk.
* The 2 oldest milk cows and the 2 bullocks are slaughtered for beef and leather. Each produces 250lbs of beef valued at 4cp per pound, or 10gp, for 40gp worth of meat total. Each produces 25lbs of leather valued at 6.6cp per pound, or 1.65gp, for 6.6gp worth of leather total.
* The 2 heifers develop into milk-cows.
* The 2 bull calves develops into bullocks.
* The 2 cow calves develop into heifers.

At year’s end, the herd has returned to its equilibrium of 8 milk-cows, 2 heifers, 2 bullocks, 2 bull calves, and 2 cow calves. Total production is (120gp + 40gp +6.6) 166.6gp and total cost is 8gp, for profit of 158.6gp. On average, revenue per head of cattle is (166.6/16) 10.41gp and labor cost is (8/16) 0.5gp.

###### Return on Investment

Purchasing 8 milk-cows, 2 heifers, 2 bull calves, and 2 cow calves costs [(8 x 10) + (2 x 10) + (2 x 5) + (2 x 5) ] 120gp. Pasture can be purchased at 15gp per acre, so purchasing 21.28 acres of pasture costs 319.2gp. Total investment is therefore 439.2gp, rounded to 440gp. According to ***ACKS***secret ratio, that should yield 13.33gp per month or 160gp per year profit. At 158.6gp per year, cattle herding yields 99% of the value predicted by the secret ratio. It’s much more profitable than mixed farming.

###### Caloric Return on Acreage

A gallon of cow milk has 2,400 calories and a pound of beef has 1,000 calories. Caloric production is therefore (1,200 x 2,400) 2,880,000 calories of milk and (250 x 4 x 1000) 1,000,000 calories of beef, or 3,880,000 calories. This takes 21.28 acres of pasture. In contrast, 21.28 acres of farmland will produce 21.28 quarters of wheat with 576,000 calories per quarter. Therefore a similar acreage of wheat farmland will produce (21.28 quarters x 8 bushel/quarter x 72 loaves/bushel x 1000 calories/loaf) 12,257,280 calories. Raising cattle is only about 30% as efficient in producing calories as wheat farming. A civilization can get rich on cattle farming, but can’t feed itself.

###### Terrain

Cattle can only be reared in Clear, Grass, Scrub, Woods, and Hills terrain. They cannot be reared in Barrens, Desert, Mountains, Swamp, or Jungle terrain.

###### Mixed Grazing

For each cattle grazed on a farm, one goat or sheep may be grazed in the same acreage. Each species eats the grasses, shrubs, and bushes it prefers, increasing the efficiency of the pasturage.

### Goat Flocks

An equilibrium flock consists of 16 goats, including 8 doe, 2 yearling doe, 2 yearling bucks, 2 doe kids, and 2 buck kids. All the does have access to an uncastrated buck. Every year, the following occurs:

* Each goat requires 5 days of labor costing 1sp per day, for a total of (16 x 5 x .1) 8gp.
* Each of the 16 goat requires 0.167 acres of pasture to graze on, for a total of 2.67 acres.
* Each of the 8 doe has a 70% annual chance of giving birth to a kid, which has a 70% chance of surviving to mid-year. Therefore there are (8 x .7 x .7) 4 kids born, of which 2 are doe kids and 2 are buck kids.
* Each of the 16 goats produces 0.5lbs of fleece worth 5sp per lbs, or 2.5sp per fleece, for a total of (16 x .25) 4gp.
* 6 of the doe produce 22.5 gallons of milk each. The 2 oldest doe and the 2 yearling doe produce 20 gallons of milk each. Total milk production is [(6 x 22.5) + (4 x 20)] 215 gallons. Milk is worth 1sp per gallon, so the herd produces 21.5gp worth of milk.
* The 2 oldest does and the 2 yearling bucks are slaughtered for chevon and leather. Each produces 33lbs of chevon valued at 3cp per pound, or 1gp, for 4gp worth of meat total. Each produces 3.3lbs of leather valued at 6.6cp per pound, or 0.22gp, for 0.88gp worth of leather total.
* The 2 yearling does develop into does.
* The 2 buck kids develops into yearling bucks.
* The 2 doe kids develop into yearling doe.

At year’s end, the flock has returned to its equilibrium of 8 doe, 2 yearling doe, 2 yearling bucks, 2 doe kids, and 2 buck kids. Total production is (4 + 21.5 + 4 + 0.88) 30.3gp and total cost is 8gp, for profit of 22.38gp. On average, revenue per goat is (30.38/16) 1.90gp and labor cost is (8/16) 0.5gp.

###### Return on Investment

Purchasing 8 doe, 2 yearling doe, 2 doe kids, and 2 buck kids cost costs [ (8 x 2) + (2 x 2) + (2 x 1) + (2 x 1) ] 24gp. Pasture can be purchased at 15gp per acre, so purchasing 2.67 acres of pasture costs 40gp. Total investment is therefore (24 + 40) 64gp. According to the ***ACKS***secret ratio, that should yield 1.93gp per month or 23.27gp per year profit. At 22.38gp per year, goat herding yields 96% of the value predicted by the secret ratio. Goats have a lower return than sheep or cattle, but a higher return than pigs or mixed farming.

###### Caloric Return on Acreage

A gallon of goat’s milk has 2,250 calories and a pound of chevon has 650 calories. Caloric production is therefore (215 x 2,250) 483,750 calories of milk and (4 x 33 x 650) 85,800 calories of chevon, or 569,550 calories, over 2.67 acres. In contrast, 2.67 acres of farmland will (2.67 quarters x 8 bushel/quarter x 72 loaves/bushel x 1000 calories/loaf) 1,537,920 calories, or 2.7 times as much. Raising goats is only 37% as efficient in producing calories as farming. They are less calorically efficient than pigs but more calorically efficient than cattle or sheep.

###### Terrain

Goats can be reared in Clear, Grass, Scrub, Woods, Mountains, Hills, or Barrens terrain. They cannot be reared in Swamp, Jungle, or Desert terrain. The ability to be reared in Mountains and Barrens terrain makes them economically competitive for peasants living outside of the most fertile lands.

###### Mixed Grazing

For each cattle grazed on a farm, one goat or sheep may be grazed in the same acreage. Each species eats the grasses, shrubs, and bushes it prefers, increasing the efficiency of the pasturage.

### Sheep Flocks

An equilibrium flock consists of 16 sheep, including 8 ewes, 2 yearling ewes, 2 yearling rams, 2 ewe lambs, and 2 ram lambs. All the ewes have access to an uncastrated ram. Every year, the following occurs:

* Each sheep requires 1.33 days of labor costing 1sp per day, for a total of (16 x 1.33 x .1) 2.13gp.
* Each of the 16 sheep requires 0.167 acres of pasture to graze on, for a total of 2.67 acres.
* Each of the 8 ewes has a 70% annual chance of giving birth to a lamb, which has a 70% chance of surviving to mid-year. Therefore there are (8 x .7 x .7) 4 lambs born, of which 2 are ewe lambs and 2 are ram lambs.
* Each of the 16 sheep produces an average of 1.5lbs of fleece, worth 5sp per lb, or 7.5sp per fleece, for a total of (16 x .75) 12gp.
* 6 of the ewes produce 9 gallons of milk each. The 2 oldest ewes and the 2 yearling ewes produce 8 gallons of milk each. Total milk production is [(6 x 9) + (4 x 8)] 86 gallons. Milk is worth 1sp per gallon, so the herd produces 8.6gp worth of milk.
* The 2 oldest ewes and the 2 yearling rams are slaughtered for mutton and leather. Each produces 25lbs of mutton valued at 4cp per pound, or 1gp, for 4gp worth of meat total. Each produces 2.5lbs of leather valued at 6.6cp per pound, or 0.165gp, for 0.67cp worth of leather total.
* The 2 yearling ewes develop into ewes.
* The 2 ram lambs develops into yearling rams.
* The 2 ewe lambs develop into yearling ewes.

At year’s end, the flock has returned to its equilibrium of 8 ewes, 2 yearling ewes, 2 yearling rams, 2 ewe lambs, and 2 ram lambs. Total production is (12 + 8.6 + 4 +0.67) 25.3gp and total cost is 2.13gp, for profit of 23.17gp. On average, revenue per sheep is (25.2 / 16) 1.58gp and labor cost is (2.13/16) 0.13gp.

###### Return on Investment

Purchasing 8 ewes, 2 yearling ewes, 2 ewe lambs, and 2 ram lambs cost costs [ (8 x 2) + (2 x 2) + (2 x 1) + (2 x 1) ] 24gp. Pasture can be purchased at 15gp per acre, so purchasing 2.67 acres of pasture costs 40gp. Total investment is therefore 64gp. According to the ***ACKS***secret ratio, that should yield 1.93gp per month or 23.16gp per year profit. At 23.17gp per year, sheep herding yields 100% of the value predicted by the secret ratio. Sheep have the highest return on investment of any livestock.

However, over 45% of a sheep’s revenue is derived from its wool. Annual consumption of wool was historically around one pound per person in pre-modern times. Since each sheep produces more than a pound of wool annually, a farmer with more than a half-dozen sheep must be producing wool for sale. Sheep herding will therefore only truly realize its value when a well-developed wool export market exists. Moreover, sheep herding is quite inefficient as a means of producing calories. Therefore, even if an export market exists, land must be widely available relative to the size of the populace in order for enough to be available as pasture for sheep. The most well-known historical confluence of these requirements is England in the centuries after the Black Death.

###### Caloric Return on Acreage

A gallon of sheep’s milk has 2,400 calories and a pound of mutton has 1,000 calories. Caloric production is therefore (86 x 2,400) 206,400 calories of milk and (4 x 25 x 1,000) 100,000 calories of mutton, or 306,400 calories. This takes 2.67 acres of pasture. In contrast, 2.67 acres of farmland will produce (2.67 quarters x 8 bushel/quarter x 72 loaves/bushel x 1000 calories/loaf) 1,537,920 calories, or 5 times as much. Raising sheep is only 20% as efficient in producing calories as farming.

###### Terrain

Sheep can be reared in Clear, Grass, Scrub, Woods, Mountains, and Hills terrain. They cannot be reared in Swamp, Barren, Desert, or Jungle terrain.

###### Mixed Grazing

For each cattle grazed on a farm, one goat or sheep may be grazed in the same acreage. Each species eats the grasses, shrubs, and bushes it prefers, increasing the efficiency of the pasturage.

### Swine Herds

An equilibrium herd consists of 11 swine, including 1 sow, 5 pigs, and 5 piglets. The sow has access to a boar. Every year, the following occurs:

* Each swine requires 3 days of labor costing 1sp per day, for a total of (11 x 3 x .1) 3.3gp.
* Each swine requires 0.1 acres of pasture to graze on, for a total of 1.1 acres.
* The sow gives birth to a litter of 6 piglets, of which 5 survive to mid-year.
* The 5 pigs are slaughtered for pork. Each produces 83lbs of pork valued at 3cp per pound, or 2.5gp, for 12.5gp worth of meat total.
* The 5 piglets develop into pigs.

Total production is 12.5gp worth of meat and total cost is 3.3gp, for a profit of 9.2gp. On average, revenue per pig is (12.5/11) 1.14gp and labor cost is (3.3/11) 0.3gp.

###### Return on Investment

Purchasing a sow and 5 piglets costs [3 + (5 x 1.5) ] 10.5gp. Pasture can be purchased at 15gp per acre, so purchasing 1.1 acres costs 16.5gp. Total investment is therefore 27gp. According to the ***ACKS***secret ratio, that should yield 0.82gp per month or 9.82gp per year profit. At 9.2gp per year, swine herding yields 94% of the value predicted by the secret ratio. Swine have the lowest return on investment of any livestock.

###### Caloric Return on Acreage

A pound of pork has 650 calories. Caloric production is therefore (5 x 83 x 650) 269,750 calories over 1.1 acres. 1.1 acres of farmland will produce 1.1 quarters of wheat, yielding (1.1 quarters x 8 bushels/quarter x 72 loaves/bushel x 1000 calories/loaf) 633,600 calories, or 2.34 times as much. Raising swine is 42% as efficient in producing calories as farming. Swine are thus the most calorically-efficient livestock. Since a single pig requires no acreage, the easiest way for peasants to introduce meat into their diet is by pig farming.

###### Terrain

Swine can be reared in Clear, Grass, Scrub, Woods, Hills, Swamp, and Jungle terrain. They cannot be reared in Mountain, Barren, or Desert terrain.

###### Pannage

To represent the practice of allowing peasant-owned swine to feed on fallen acorns and nuts in nearby woodlands, each peasant family can rear a single swine without allocating acreage per family.

**Historical Note:** Historically, meat has been estimated at 5 to 6 1/2 times as expensive as wheat on a caloric basis. Since a 1,000-calorie loaf of bread costs 0.69cp, we should expect a 1,000-calorie serving of meat to cost 3.45cp to 4.49cp. Mutton and beef have about 1,000 calories per pound, so they should cost about 3.45cp to 4.49cp per pound. Chevon and pork have about 650 calories per pound, so they should cost 2.25cp to 2.93cp per pound. In these rules, we assume that beef and mutton costs 4cp per pound, chevon and pork costs 3cp per pound, and other meat costs 2cp per pound.

## Urban Economics

The average income of a peasant family is between 4 and 6gp per month. In comparison, the average income of an urban family is between 25 and 75gp per month, or about five to ten times higher. However, this does not mean that most urban families are wealthy. The average is skewed by wealthy urban elites, such as bankers, lawyers, magistrates, master craftsmen, and merchants. The median income of an urban family is only 6 to 12gp per month. The median urban income is greater than that of the peasantry, but of course offset by higher costs.

### Circular Flow of Goods

To understand how these values were derived requires a slight diversion into the circular flow of an agricultural economy. Assume a simple domain with 80 peasant families, 20 urban families, and 1 ruler. If each peasant family produces 16.25gp of farm goods and consumes 4.25gp of farm goods, that leaves 12gp of farm goods unconsumed, which pass to the local ruler (960gp total). The ruler could reasonably spend 50% of his income on farm goods (including grain, meat, cheese, beer, wine, oil, honey, firewood, horse fodder, etc.) but the remaining 50% (480gp) will be spent on finer goods only available from the artisans and craftsmen of urban settlements. To get money for this, he sells the farm goods to the urban settlers for 480gp, then buys 480gp of urban goods from them. The urban families, in turn, are only spending 50% of their income on farm goods, so they must have a collective income of 960gp (2 x 480gp), with the other 480gp of income coming from the sale of their own urban goods to each other. (E.g., the candlemaker buys cloth from the clothier, who buys candles from the candlemaker.) The urban families therefore produce on average (960gp/20) 48gp each.

But these variables can easily change depending on agricultural productivity, consumption pattern, and population distribution. Given the same agricultural productivity and consumption pattern, an increase in urban population means a decrease in per-capita urban income, and vice versa. In a realm where 30% of the population is urban, urban income would drop to 28gp per month, with large numbers of “urban plebs” living in the cities. If only 10% of the population is urban, but half of consumption is urban, urban income would increase to 96gp per month.

Given the same agricultural productivity and population distribution, an increase in consumption of urban goods means an increase in per-capita urban income, and vice versa. For instance, if the nobility spends 55% of its income on urban goods, and the peasants spend 35% of its income on urban goods, then the urban families will have 2 x [ (960 x .55) + (80 x 4.25 x .35) ] 1,296gp in income, or around 65gp each. But if a manorial system develops in which the countryside is largely self-sufficient, then the nobility might spend as little as 35% of its income on farm goods and the peasantry spend nothing at all; in this case the urban families will have 2 x (960 x .35) 672gp in income, or around 33gp each.

Likewise, given the same population distribution and consumption pattern, an increase in agricultural productivity means an increase in urban income, and vice versa. For instance, if the peasant families produce 20gp of farm goods each, and consume 4.25gp of farm goods and 4gp of urban goods, then the urban families will have 2 x [ (960 x .5) + (80 x 4) ] 1,600gp in come, or 80gp each.

All of these trends would interact with each other. If a realm’s central government becomes weak and power decentralizes into landed nobility, this will tend to lead towards more self-sufficient manors that purchase fewer urban goods. That will decrease the income of the urban families, which will lead to some families fleeing the cities for the countryside, until a new equilibrium arises. Or, if a realm’s agricultural productivity becomes so high that all of its agricultural needs are satiated, then the peasantry will abandon the country and move to the city, which in turn will drive down urban income…

### Circulation of Coinage

How much coin is there in a domain, realm, or world? The economist Richard Cantillon assessed the typical coinage in circulation of a pre-industrial economy as equal to around one-ninth the product of the land. In ***ACKS*** a peasant family produces 16.25gp per month or 195gp per year, suggesting 21.6gp of coinage in circulation. We selected 24gp per family so that each family would have sufficient coinage to pay their taxes (2gp per month) annually in coin. Therefore, the amount of coinage in circulation in a realm will equal 24gp per peasant family. One-third of the value will be in gold; one-third in silver, and one-third in copper, yielding a ratio of 1:10:100 in number. E.g. the 24gp of value will actually consist of 8gp, 80sp, and 800cp. 50% of that coinage will be in the urban settlements and 50% spread throughout the rest of the realm.

EXAMPLE: A realm of 5,000,000 peasant families has (5,000,000 x 24) 120,000,000gp worth of coins circulating. These consist of 40,000,000gp; 400,000,000sp; and 4,000,000,000cp. At 100 coins per pound, the tonnage in circulation is 200 tons of gold, 2000 tons of silver, and 12,500 tons of copper. Half of that is found in the cities and towns of the realm.

A character’s capital or net worth in ***ACKS*** is typically equal to 33 times monthly earnings. A typical peasant farm produces 16.25gp per month (shared between ruler and peasants), suggesting net worth of about 536gp is associated with the farm. The 24gp in circulation associated with that farm therefore reflects only about 5% of the farm’s net worth. Put another way, the vast majority of wealth in ***ACKS***is in land, livestock, tools, etc.

**Historical Note:** Persian Empire had a population of 7 million families, so our rules would predict 168,000,000gp worth of coins – about 56 million gold, 560 million silver, and 5.6 billion copper. We know the Persian Empire conquered by Alexander the Great had a store of precious metals worth 200,000 silver talents, divided between 10,000 gold talents and 100,000 silver talents. That works out to (60lbs/talent x 100 coins/lbs. x 10,000) 60,000,000gp and 600,000,000sp. Spot on!

Meanwhile the 2nd Century AD Roman Empire had a population of about 8 million families, so our rules would predict 192,000,000gp worth of coins – about 64 million gold, 640 million silver, and 6.4 billion copper. We know that the Roman Empire had an annual product of about 10 tons of gold, 200 tons of silver, and 15,000 tons of copper, that allowed it to accumulate vast stores of metal – as much as 500 tons of gold, 10,000 tons of silver, and 750,000 tons of copper. That is enough for 100 million gold, 2 billion silver, and 150 billion copper coins. Of course, some of the silver and most of the copper was used for ornaments or tools, but the Romans certainly had ample metal for the coinage we predict.

Should you wish to create a venerable dragon that has accumulated all of the coin of an entire kingdom, you now can do so! Such a treasure will be greatly in excess of the paltry hoards presented in the Treasure Types.

## Continental Economics

As part of creating ***ACKS II****,* we built a model of the entire economy of Aurëpos, which in turn enabled us to simulate everything from the average age of a baron to the amount of iron produced annually in Krysea. The effects of this simulation are implicit in every demographic and economic mechanic in the game.

### Continental Population Data

The first step in our econometric analysis of Aurëpos was demographics. The tables below show the total population of the continent, along with how that population is allocated. Mathematically there are 5.86 people in the realm per 5-person family. From that excess of 0.86 people per family are drawn the “special individuals,” who include garrison troops, camp followers, tithed clergy, mages, thieves, mercenaries, bandits, specialists, adventurers, and everyone else who isn’t a peasant, miner, bourgeoise, or aristocrat.

Note that the peasant population has been divided into farming, mining, and lumberjacking. The peasant population was first assigned to mining labor in the necessary ratios to work the mines generated for Aurëpos using the ***AXIOMS***article *Ore Never Changes* and ***By This Axe****,* which in turn were based on the proportions of the actual Roman Empire. The peasant population was then assigned to lumberjacking in sufficient numbers to produce charcoal to support the mining families and firewood to support the total population. The remaining peasant population was then assigned to farming.

Little historical data exists on the ratio of grain farms to pastures to vineyards to groves. To ascertain the proportions of the different types of farms, we incremented over and over again through the possible combinations until we found a set that produced the following outcomes:

* Enough calories were produced to feed the population, including horses.
* Enough olive oil and wine were produced to match historical consumption of those goods.
* Enough fleece and leather were produced to manufacture 2.5 garments per peasant family per year.

### Continental Economic Production

Abovewe presented a microeconomic model of an average peasant family, which operated a 30 acre farm with an ox, 3 cows, 1 pig, and 32 sheep. From this it produced 16.25gp per month of crops, milk, wool, meat, and goods per month. Of this produce, 12gp per month are paid in rents and taxes, leaving the peasant family with a subsistence income of 4.25gp per month.

Below, we have presented a macroeconomic model of total production of goods when peasant families are allocated to a broad variety of tasks. The GP values per unit are previously published ***ACKS***prices*.* We have separately presented an analysis showing that these prices are historically plausible; see the ***AXIOMS*** article “*The Price of Everything*” for more details.

The production levels for timber, stone, iron, lead, copper, silver, gold, and gems follow directly from the rules in *Ore Never Changes* and are the population-adjusted equivalent to Roman production levels or are implied by those values (e.g. charcoal for timber).

The production levels for each individual type of farm are based on historical data for the productivity and expenses of operating different types of farms.The production level for “other goods” was determined by calculating the number of labor days available to the farming families (500 days per family) and then subtracting the labor days required to operate the farms. The surplus labor days were then assigned to produce “other goods” at a rate of 1sp of goods per day. Some of these “goods” may actually be services, but for purposes of our model they are categorized together.

The macroeconomic model shows that the average peasant family produces 16.27gp per month, virtually identical to the 16.25gp per month produced by our peasant family in our microeconomic model. The ***ACKS II***economy thus functions both top-down and bottom-up in a coherent manner.

## Economic Prices

Properly pricing goods and services in tabletop role-playing games is so difficult that almost no designer ever gets it right. Even the most popular RPGs on the market usually fail completely. Many don’t even bother to try. Why is it so hard to have proper pricing? Well, what makes a price “proper”? What determines price?

### Historical Determinants of Price

In the short term, prices are dynamic and subjective, functioning as bits of information that tell prospective buyers the point at which transactions would currently be seen as acceptable to those sellers. They are determined by supply and a demand, and they change in response to changes to that supply and demand. In any given year, month, week, or even day the price of a good can fluctuate widely. In any given town, county, state, or nation, it can vary with geography. It is exceptionally difficult to simulate dynamic and subjective prices in a tabletop role-playing game, and largely unnecessary outside of a limited scope (arbitrage trading, perhaps). All RPGs largely depend on static and objective prices.

In the long term, prices are relational. Offering goods and services requires consuming goods and services. The price of a good or service must exceed the cost of the goods and services consumed in offering it; those in turn must exceed the cost of the goods and services consumed in offering them; and so on. Ultimately, the price of food must exceed the cost of producing food, directly measured in food required to feed the family producing it, or a society cannot have any economic activity beyond subsistence. Unlike dynamic and subjective prices, relational prices *can* be simulated. If the game is to be coherent at campaign scale, they *must* be simulated. Having proper relations between prices has long been the goal for ***ACKS****,* and was the goal introduced in our very first post on the Autarch blog, entitled *Starting from the Ground Up*:

Unlike many contemporary fantasy RPGs, the Adventurer Conqueror King System has been designed with the view that many gamemasters want to be able to simulate an ancient and/or medieval world in such a way that their campaign world makes sense. The income of peasants makes sense in relation to the income of kings. The cost of swords and the income of the swordsmiths who make them has some relation. Treasure exists in more forms than simply gold, gems, and magic. The easiest and best way to achieve a world with verisimilitude is to start with historical assumptions.

But starting with historical assumptions does not mean just using historical prices. Indeed, the most common mistake that designers make in pricing goods and services is to compile historical price lists from widely separate regions or eras, assume that those prices were static and objective, and then ignore the relations between them. These “Cargo Cult” prices are everywhere in RPGs.

When the original Auran Empire campaign began, we were using the prices found in the *D&D Rules Cyclopedia*. As the game progressed into high levels, where military affairs and domain rulership become ever-more-important, it became clear to me that the prices didn’t relate to each other correctly. As we sought other solutions, we reviewed *OD&D, AD&D,* and even Dave Arneson’s *First Fantasy Campaign.* As we explained in *Starting from the Ground Up, Part II*:

In the *D&D Cyclopedia*, a peasant family is worth 12gp per month, while in the *First Fantasy Campaign* its worth only 3gp per month. Meanwhile, in both *D&D Cyclopedia* and *First Fantasy*, a heavy footman costs just 1/4 of that, or 3gp per month. The gp revenue per peasant for *First Fantasy* is too low relative to historical values and compared to other prices in the rules. A footman paid 3gp per month cannot afford to live on the prices in the rules. Since the *First Fantasy Campaign* undervalued the value of a peasant, the *First Fantasy Campaign* had to set its population densities vastly in excess of historical standards, which was necessary to provide sufficient funds for the players to field appropriately sized armies. Meanwhile the *D&D Cyclopedia* has population densities vastly below historical standards, which was necessary because *D&D Cyclopedia* has undervalued how much armies cost. The *First Fantasy Campaign* has densely packed countrysides filled with inefficient farmers paying the wages of dirt-cheap soldiers; while *D&D Cyclopedia* has empty countrysides filled with standard medieval farmers in just sufficient numbers to pay the wages of dirt-cheap soldiers.

The earliest foundations of our hobby had gotten the core relationship between the price of labor, the price of food, and the price of soldiers totally wrong! ***ACKS II***has corrected this, in what is arguably its most important economic improvement of what has come before. These solutions have already been discussed under Baseline Assumptions earlier in this appendix.

But what about the price of everything else?

### How ACKS Prices Were Set

To correctly set the relational price of any given good or service in ***ACKS****,* we needed a historical price for the good, and the historical price for wheat, extracted from the same time and place. Otherwise we’d just have Cargo Cult prices.

Fortunately, while developing ***ACKS II****,* we were able to find an English translation of all of the known fragments of the *Edictum de Pretiis Rerum Venalium,* better known as the Edict on Maximum Prices. Issued in 301 AD by Emperor Diocletian, the Edict sets the maximum price for hundreds of goods and services in denarii.

What makes the Edict so useful for ***ACKS***is that it is set in the time period that the Auran Empire campaign emulates, Late Antiquity. By knowing how much a Diocletian denarii was worth in ***ACKS****,* we were able to use the Edict to establish historical prices for the huge number of goods and services that it covers. Since ***ACKS***prices were benchmarked against wheat, where 1 quarter of wheat costs 4gp, we were able to use the price of wheat in the Edict to work out the value of the denarii.

The Edict tells us that 1 modius kastrensis (“k. mod.”) of wheat sold for 100 denarii. The modius is a unit of dry measure equivalent to 8.73 liters. The modius kastrensis is equal to 1.5 modius, hence 12.93 liters. 12.93 liters of wheat weighs 22.15lbs. Since a quarter of wheat is 480lbs, there are (480/22.15 =) 21.67 k. mod per quarter. Therefore the price of a quarter of wheat, under the Edict, is (100 denarii / k. mod) x (21.67 k. mod / quarter) = 2166.33 denarii. We have established that 1 quarter of wheat is worth 4gp. Therefore 4gp/quarter = 2166 denarii/quarter; and 1gp = 541.58 denarii.

With this conversion rate established, we are able to establish wheat-relative prices for all the various goods and services extracted from the Edict and convert them into denominations of gp, sp, and cp. However, as we did so, we discovered that just because a price is in the Edict doesn’t necessarily mean it’s the proper price for ***ACKS****.* For one thing, the Edict itself was a price fixing statute, and governments have a long history of getting price controls very wrong. Diocletian might have been – for all we know – as bad at pricing goods and services as the typical RPG. In addition, the very particular conditions means that some prices might be peculiar to that place and time. From time to time, we even encountered prices in the Edict that were mathematically impossible – goods selling for less than their cost of production, for instance. In such cases we have revised the prices based on other research. Finally, we must also note that certain adventuring equipment in ***ACKS II***are simply not priced historically. In particular:

* While the medium and heavy armors are correctly priced, padded and leather armor are too expensive relative to historical norms. Padded armor should probably be 2-5gp while leather armor should be no more than 5gp. For simplicity we standardized at 10gp = 1 AC = 1 stone.
* Grappling hooks and other climbing gear do not seem to have been in wide use during Late Antiquity. Their use in naval warfare (with grappling ballista) is notable enough that the ancient historians go out of their way to mention it. We have retained them in ***ACKS II****,* but raised the price to reflect that they are a specialized technology not otherwise in use.
* Healing herbs with the potent efficacy of those found in ***ACKS II***are simply fantasy. No poultice of comfrey or woundwort had anywhere near the curative power we have assigned them. However, healing herbs with a realistic level of efficacy would have almost no discernable game effect. Therefore we have magnified the efficacy of healing herbs to a playable (albeit fantastical) level, and increased their cost to an ahistorical level to compensate. If verisimilitude is a worry, assume the healing herbs are rare, fragile, and hard-to-find varietals of the real-world herbs.
* Lanterns of the sort described in the Adventuring Equipment section did not exist in Late Antiquity. However, they probably *would have* existed in a Late Antiquity in which legionaries had to enter dungeons to fight monsters. Therefore we have included them in the game but at an ahistorical high cost. The same is true for adventurer’s harnesses, disguise kits, thieves’ tools, and other adventuring equipment. All of these items were well within the capabilities of the ancients.
* The carts and wagons that existed in Late Antiquity were relatively primitive in the construction of their harnesses, yokes, and wheels. Rather than force adventurers to endlessly deal with broken axels, oxen choking on poor harness, and so on, we have included vehicles more appropriate for a later era and raised the price accordingly. You can simulate historical carts and wagons by applying some of the cost reduction and penalties from the scavenged equipment tables.

# Appendix P: Parties

One of the more time-consuming requirements of monster encounters can be creating NPC adventuring parties. In this appendix, we present a number of parties of adventurers for your use. All of these adventurers were commissioned by high-tier backers of the ***ACKS Imperial Imprint,*** to whom we owe our great gratitude. The entries focus on the information that will be most useful to you in using them as allies, foes, or foils of your own adventurers.

Equipment is presented in the following order: primary weapon, secondary weapon(s), shield, armor, helmet, worn or slung magic items, belt pouch, pouched magic items, pouched adventuring equipment, backpack, packed magic items, packed adventuring equipment, purse (coins). NPCs with mounts typically carry non-essential equipment (e.g. blankets) in their mounts’ saddlebags. All mounts are riding mounts unless otherwise noted. ML modifiers only apply when the party members are used as NPCs, not as PCs.

## Orison’s Devotion

**Background:** A charismatic leader with an almost supernatural magnetism, Orison is a Rornish prince and paladin devoted to the deified warrior-king Valerian Bellësareus. After a decade of fighting Jutlanders in the northern marches of Rorn, Orison was able to secure his borders and establish a firm rule. Now, however, he has left his domain in the hands of his trusty stewards in order to undertake a great crusade. Orison can sense the rising evil that foretells the onset of the Awakening and knows that, if unchecked, chaos will overwhelm the realms of men. To prevent this dire occurrence, he has assembled a band of powerful heroes willing to brave the Wastes. As a matter of faith, Orison believes that the final battle will come on the plains of Morgot, where his hero Valerian fought and died, and will take almost any risk in the certainty of that decisive moment to come.

**Description:** Orison is a tall, heavily muscled man in his early 30s with golden hair, blue eyes, and a strong jaw. His voice and tone are of a man used to being in commanded, though he softens in the presence of women and children. His mount, Athorian, is a palomino warhorse of exceptional conformation, agility, and power.

###### Vilhelmus Turpilia Vindex

**Equipment:** *“Winter’s Bite”* (*sword +3*),dagger, *shield +2*, *plate armor +2*, heavy helmet, *cloak of protection +1*, *gauntlets of ogre power, ring of protection +1*, holy symbol (winged sun of Ammonar), red crusader’s cassock, embossed leather belt, high leather boots, short leather gloves, backpack with *potion of angelic aura, 3 potions of cure light injury, potion of deflect ordinary weapons, 2 potions of fire protection, potion of freedom, potion of flight, potion of growth, potion of invulnerability to evil, 2 potions of recuperation*, *2* *potions of swift sword,* 3 flasks of holy water, purse (100gp, 100sp), enc 9 5/6 st.

**Holdings:** Fortified Temple in Argollëan Marches (stronghold value: 210,000gp; chaplain income: 1,200gp/month; divine power: 19,150gp per month from 9,577 faithful families).

**Followers/Mercenaries:** 2 companies of Auran heavy infantry (spear, short sword, shield, banded plate armor). Other henchmen and followers have remained to protect his fortified temple and minister to congregants..

**Side Effects:** Golden eyes: suffers a -2 penalty to reaction rolls with Chaotic creatures.

**Background:** Vilhelmus thought he had finished with the adventuring life: years spent riding back and forth across Southern Argollë and the Borderlands had taken their toll, and whilst a brush with death had marked him with Ammonar’s favor, adventuring was really a youngster’s profession. After being appointed chaplain to the prefect of the Argollëan Marches (north of the Borderlands), Vilhelmus constructed aa fortified temple to minister to the expanding Auran population there. It seemed like an excellent option for a retired adventurer, and at first, all seemed well. But then the dreams and visions began — visions of increasing urgency, of the terrible Chthonic plan already in motion known as the Awakening, and of the threat just south of his new home, in the Borderlands. Like the stoic champion of Law that he in fact was, Vilhelmus brought out his heavy plate armor, his shield, and the cold steel sword that his family had held for generations, and set out to find fellow champions of Ammonar: for he knew with calm certainty that he would not be the only one summoned to the Borderlands to foil the machinations of the Chthonic gods.

**Description:** Vilhelmus is a middle-aged man with blue eyes and black hair. His face is lined with years of toil, but he carries himself with ramrod-straight posture and never complains about his age. His family’s ancestral blade, Winter’s Bite*,* is forged of white orichalcum; when wielded, the blade sheds snowflakes behind it.

###### Cartamo Dugzoon

**10th level Zaharan Ruinguard** (commissioned by DS)

**Stat Line:** AC 12, Spd 30’ / 90’, HP 49, ATK 1 (*javelin +3 of hurling,* 1+ melee or 0+ thrown), Dmg 1d6+8, Init +3, Surprise +1, ML +3, AL Lawful

**Attributes:** STR 13, INT 11, WIL 11, DEX 16, CON 12, CHA 14

**Languages:** Common, Ancient Zaharan, Goblin, Kemeshi, Orc.

**Spellcasting:** Caster Level 8, Spells per Day 4 1st, 2 2nd, 2 3rd, 2 4th

**Spell Repertoire:** 1st – *sharpness, slickness, thunderclap, wall of smoke*; 2nd – *gale of wind, ogre strength*; 3rd – *perpetual illumination, spellward;* 4th - *arcane shift, earth’s tremor*.

**Equipment:** *javelin of hurling +3*, masterwork dagger (+1/+1), *shield +1, lamellar armor +1, helm of disalignment*, *ring of protection +1*, white armiger’s tunic and pants, embossed belt, high leather boots, backpack with *potion of death ward, potion of giant strength, potion of necromantic potence,* scroll case with *arcane scroll of beguile humanoid, inaudibility, warp wood, locate object*, and *arcane shift*, spell book, pouch (100gp, 100sp), enc. 5 4/6 st.

**Mount:** Medium warhorse, war saddle and tack, saddlebag with blanket, mess kit, tinderbox, 6 torches, waterskin, 1 week iron rations.

**Holdings:** None. Cartamo has been reluctant to establish a stronghold because of the beastmen he will attract to his service.

**Followers/Mercenaries:** None.

**Background:** Cartamo Dugzoon was raised in a nomadic band of Kemeshi mercenaries. After striking out on his own, he fell in with one of the most unsavory bands of adventurers this side of the Dark Wall and acted as retainer to a pair of successive Chaotic spellcasters, in whose service he accrued wealth and arcane lore. Outliving both lieges (with Cartamo himself being whispered as the proximate cause for the death of the latter), he became notorious for his casual brutality, efficacy in battle, and wrathful hot-headedness. Countless men and monstrosities fell to his blades and sorcery, with Cartamo caring only for the wealth looted afterwards. His impatience and impulsiveness finally did him in when he plucked a magical helm from a dungeon hoard and donned it — only to immediately realize it was a *helm of disalignment*. Changed to be as prudent, thoughtful, and benevolent as he had once been reckless, violent, and malevolent, Cartamo absconded from his erstwhile comrades and sought to redeem his lifetime of cruelty. Now a champion of Law in service to Ammonar, Cartamo’s fearsome prowess makes him a mighty ally to any righteous cause —so long as his helmet remains intact...

**Description**: Cartamo is of middling height and build, but strong and swift as a darting viper. In the past he would intentionally appear as barbaric as possible, wearing the hairstyle of a Jutland raider and festooned with garlands of skeletal fingers (or worse). Now he makes an effort to both dress and act the part of a proper holy warrior pledged to Ammonar, with the winged sun prominently displayed on his shield and tabard. He hopes to atone for the utter carelessness and vileness of his former life in both word and deed, perhaps even redeeming his own tainted bloodline, should the Empyrean powers see fit to grant this boon.

###### Melflay the Perilous

**10th level Elven Spellsword**

**Stat Line:** AC 10, Spd 20’ / 60’, HP 50, ATK 1 (*Foe-Cleaver* 0+ or masterwork bow 2+), Dmg 1d6+6/1d8+6 or 1d6+4, Init +2, Surprise +1 (+1 Wilderness), ML +3, AL Lawful

**Mount:** Medium warhorse, war saddle and tack, saddlebag with blanket, mess kit, tinderbox, 6 torches, waterskin, 1 week iron rations.

**Holdings:** Principality of Sianel in Northern Argollë (civilized; stronghold value: 180,000gp; personal domain population 7,500 peasant families and 1,865 urban families; realm population 190,000 families; realm income: 70,500gp/month).

**Followers/Mercenaries:** 120 elven horse archers (composite bow, scimitar, leather armor, light warhorse). Other henchmen and followers have remained to govern his prefecture.

**Background:** Hailing from Northern Argollë, the Wizard-Lord Melflay has long fought against the Chthonic forces — the hunting hawk symbol of his clan is often associated with the eagles and rocs of Ammonar, and is an apt symbol, for like his forefathers before him, Melflay is not one to sit back and wait for dark forces to come to him. When news came that his old human companion’s grandson, Prince Orison, was seeking allies with which to secure the Borderlands from the growing threats from the Waste, Melflay was only too happy to join the honorable paladin, bringing not only his peerless skills as a spellsword, but also his ability to drill and train soldiers. Melflay knows that it will ultimately be the efforts of the common soldier, more than the deeds of the great heroes, that defends civilization, and he intends to raise legions fit to make the Tarkaun himself green with envy.

**Description:** Melflay is a blonde, hazel-eyed, and handsome elf, ageless like all of his people. He is taller and heavier than the average elf, and would be easily mistaken for a Rornishman if not for his pointed ears. His sword, *Foe Cleaver,* was forged by dwarves during the Beastman Wars and has claimed the lives of countless goblins, gnolls, and orcs. His *shield +2* bears the hunting hawk symbol of his noble lineage; every inch of its surface is as flawless as the day it was made, for neither dirt, grime, nor blows leave a mark.

## The Company of the North

The Company of the North is a mercenary band founded by a Jutland war-chief who seeks glorious death in battle against chaos. Its other members, though equally formidable, are somewhat less devoted to this militant cause.

###### Kael Ó Conchúir

**11th level Jutlandic Barbarian** (commissioned by Robert Whitcomb)

**Stat Line:** AC 8/11, Spd 30’ / 90’, HP 47, ATK 1 (*Shard of the North* -4+ or *+2 battle axe* -4+), Dmg 2d10+9 or 2d6+9, Init +2, Surprise +1, ML +3, AL Lawful

**Attributes:** STR 18, INT 11, WIL 16, DEX 13, CON 16, CHA 14

**Saving Throws:** Paralysis 4+, Death 5+, Blast 6+, Implements 7+, Spells 8+

**Class Powers:** Animal Reflexes, Natural Proficiency (Jutland), Natural Stealth, Savage Resilience, Animal Magnetism, Chieftain’s Hall.

**Proficiencies:** Adventuring, Climbing, Combat Ferocity, Command, Endurance, Fighting Style Specialization (Two-Handed Weapons), Leadership, Riding, Seafaring 2, Weapon Focus (Swords & Daggers).

**Languages:** Common, Jutlandic.

**Equipment:** *Shard of the North (two-handed sword +2, +3 vs chaos*), *battle axe +2,* s*hield +2*, *chain mail +3*, light helmet, *belt of giant strength, boots of striding,* jarl’s tunic and pants, embossed leather belt, high leather boots, backpack with *3 potions of cure major injury*, grappling hook, 50’ rope, pouch (100gp, 100sp), enc. 6 1/6 st.

**Mount:** Medium warhorse, war saddle and tack, saddlebag with blanket, mess kit, tinderbox, 6 torches, waterskin, 1 week iron rations.

**Holdings:** Jarldom of North Skavan (outlands clanhold; stronghold value: 180,000gp; personal domain population 6,375 peasant families and 250 urban families; realm population 175,000 families; realm income: 66,000gp/month).

**Followers/Mercenaries:** 120 Jutlandic huscarls (spear, sword, chain mail, shield). Other henchmen and followers have remained to govern his jarldom.

**Side Effects:** Notably Scarred (+1 Intimidation, -2 to impersonate others).

**Background:** When Kael ó Conchúir was born, the runecasters proclaimed him destined for greatness. They were right: A thane’s son hailing from the western reaches of Jutland, Kael grew into a natural leader and born warrior. He has travelled the length and breadth of the Ammasaurëan Sea. Some say he even passed north of the Jutting Mountains, from whence he returned with his magical blade — and a long scar down the right side of his face. Whatever the truth of such tales, after his return, he overthrew the jarl his father had served and claimed the jarldom as his by right of conquest. There he might have stayed, a jarl of fierce disposition but uncommon wisdom, had not the runecasters and shamans of his clan told of him of a terrible threat rising far to the southeast. Leaving his jarldom in his son’s safe hands, Kael ó Conchúir set out for one last adventure, one guaranteed to earn him a glorious afterlife dying in battle against the horrors his blade thirsts to destroy.

**Description:** Kael is a tall and strongly-built Jutlander with ruddy skin and red hair and beard now streaked with gray. His face is battered from wind and cold, with many scars, the largest of which is a jagged gash from hairline to chin that just misses his red eye. Kael claims that his great sword, the *Shard of the North,* was forged before the Day Without Night and given to him by a winged sage who lived in the mountains. True or not, the remarkable weapon is forged of white orichalcum in an ancient style reminiscent of swords illustrated on mosaics in the hilltop ruins of the Syrnasos.

**Mount:** Light horse, riding saddle and tack, saddlebag with blanket, mess kit, tinderbox, 6 torches, waterskin, 1 week iron rations.

**Holdings:** Hideout in Samos (7,350gp syndicate revenue; 12,250gp guild revenue; 36,000gp treasury)

**Followers/Mercenaries:** 108 ruffians (49 0th level, 36 1st level, 14 2nd level, 5 3rd level, 2 4th level, 1 5th level, 1 6th level).

**Background:** Ravus Faelus has done quite well for himself in the permissive and uncertain environment of the crumbling Auran Empire. With a shifting cast of fellow ne’er-do-wells at his side, his meticulously-planned heists have looted fortunes of gold and goods from such former owners as Dirgion death-cults, Imperial border forts, and Argollëan elf-tombs. His audacious guile does not end with mere wealth acquisition: he famously escaped prison while awaiting trial for high treason (after being caught red-handed sifting through the Prefect’s own quarters searching for compromising information); once free he was able to not only ‘clear’ his name, but to also purchase an Imperial rank of Patrician through judiciously-applied blackmail, astoundingly-generous donations to the priestesses of the Lady of Fortune, and naked politicking. To further his reputation, he has now generously endowed Kael’s adventuring party in its “defense of the Borderlands.” Ravus assiduously forgoes physical confrontation whenever possible, and considers his efforts a failure if he has to personally draw steel at any point; despite this maxim of eschewing heroics, several of his greatest hijinks unexpectedly have dealt heavy blows to the forces of Chaos. Heavy, profitable blows.

**Description:** Ravus is of medium height and medium build, with features best described as “nondescript.” When it benefits him to appear otherwise, however, he can shed his modest mien and present himself as a man of dignity and status —a necessity when rubbing shoulders with his fellow Patricians at contrived social events.

**Background:** Asyif was born to a noble family in Zidium, capital of Celdorea. When Asyif was but a child, his father was sent, family in tow, to Aura as an emissary of the Celdorean shah. In Aura, the young Celdorean displayed a promising gift for sorcery; his father begrudgingly permitted him to study magic at the Tower of Knowledge. During the course of his studies, Asyif become fascinated by the lost secrets of the elves. Departing Aura for Southern Argollë, he eventually made his way to Cyfaraun, capital of the Borderlands. Since his father has cut him off from his family wealth for refusing to return home, Asyif needs to adventure to fund his research into ancient elven magic. The Company of the North seemed as good a band as any with which to explore and plunder.

**Description:** Asyif eschews the robes of a wizard, instead dressing with all the extravagance of a wealthy Celdorean noble at court. The only evidence of his sorcerous powers is his owl-tipped *staff +1*. Though handsome and noble in visage, he always conceals his face in public beneath a polished silver mask that resembles a cataphract face-plate. The mask is actually a magic item of his own creation, equivalent to a *brooch of arcane armor* except in presentation*.*

**Followers/Mercenaries:** 8 apprentices (1 3rd level witch, 1 2nd level witch, 6 0th level apprentice witches).

**Background:** Though the forests of Southern Argollë have largely disappeared as human civilization has marched across the region, many of those areas that remain are often known for the dark things that still lurk in shadowed groves, and those who live near them speak variously of missing children, unearthly lights, or haunting sounds when the moon is hidden. Into this world was born Dalefa Sarëdis. Marked with the dove of Mityara over her heart and the ears of an elf, Dalefa was destined from birth to tread the boundary between the seen and unseen worlds, and in her early teens first made contact with the spirits that roam Southern Argollë. Spurred on by fate and her unseen allies, she won considerable renown as an adventurer in her homeland, working tirelessly to undo the damage caused by the terrible events of the past. Though she would prefer the seclusion of her cottage, Dalefa cannot stand by while beastmen raids worsen the plight of the Borderlands. The Chthonic threat must be extinguished, and the troubled Borderlands secured for the Auran Empire once more. Kael ó Conchúir, though not even from this land, knows what must be done, and that is why she follows him.

**Description:** Dalefa is petite, but sturdy, with a round face, green eyes, naturally curly shoulder-length blonde hair. Her elven bloodline is evident, not just from her pointed ears and high cheekbones, but in her ageless appearance. Though she has adventured for decades Dalefa still appears no older than 20.

**Mount:**Light horse, riding saddle and tack, saddlebag with blanket, mess kit, tinderbox, 4 stakes and mallet, 6 iron spikes, 6 torches, waterskin, 1 week iron rations.

**Holdings:**SecludedMountain Border Fort and Surrounding Lands (outlands; stronghold value: 60,000gp; personal domain population 215 peasant families; realm income: 1,3000gp/month).

**Followers/Mercenaries:** 60 hunters (bola, net, 3 javelins, hand axe, leather armor), 60 light infantry (spear, battle axe, shield, leather armor), and 60 longbowmen (long bow, sword, chain mail). A alchemist, armorer, chirugeon, two creature handlers, and other hirelings maintain the mountain hold.

**Background**: Bodo spent most of his youth traveling with his father Mencida, a merchant of middling success, from the Krysean coast to Aura and beyond. His mother had died in childbirth, and with no one to help raise the boy, Mencida instilled responsibility and independence at an early age. While dutiful to his father, Bodo was never drawn to follow in his footsteps, although he proved to have an uncanny knack with animals, both in the traveling caravans and in the wilds. This gift led Mencida to the conclusion that Bodo was gifted by Naurivus for some divine purpose beyond a merchant’s trade, and as his son came of age he sent him out to find his purpose in this world. Bodo left the merchant’s life to serve a brief stint in the Imperial Army and was trained as a scout and sniper. However he found military discipline chafing and returned to his homeland in Krysea as soon as he was able. In the intervening years, Bodo has gained fame as a dangerous foe to the beastmen and darker horrors that lurk in the Meniri Mountains. For his service to the Empire, Bodo was granted permission to established a small fiefdom in the southern marches of Krysea. He has spent the last several years ruling from an ancient stronghold taken by force from a petty hobgoblin chief, which he has repurposed as a trading post and citadel to protect key mountain passes from the dangers that arise in the Waste. Recently, he has left the stronghold in the care of his able steward in order to travel to the increasingly-endangered Borderlands, where has joined the Company of the North as a guide for their expedition into the Zaharan Waste.

**Description**: Standing 5’7” with light brown eyes and wavy, dark auburn hair, Bodo’s tanned and wind-battered complexion and simple, homespun appearance belie his skill and instinctive grace as well as his station. Only the elegantly made cloak, bow, and boots, a gift from the elf fastnesses of Southern Argollë, reveal Bodo’s success as an adventurer, explorer, and fortune hunter. Fair-minded, plain spoken, and gentle with animals and children, he is rarely encountered without being trailed by some bird or beast who has taken an interest in him. As for the humans within his domain, the small hamlet that has grown around his secluded mountain fort hold their lord in esteem. Rumors that he is a friend to murderous beasts who protect him and his lands only adds to his dangerous reputation.

## The Drakonian Guard

The Drakonian Guard is a hard-bitten band of adventurers organized by the mercenary captain Drakon to profit from the unrest in the Borderlands.

###### Drakon

**7th level Fighter** (commissioned by Heather Szutka)

**Stat Line:** AC 9, Spd 30’/90’, HP 34, ATK 1 (*+1 sword* 5+), Dmg 1d6+4/1d8+4, Init 0, ML +3, AL Lawful

**Attributes:** STR 12, INT 16, WIL 11, DEX 11, CON 11, CHA 16

**Saving Throws:** Paralysis 9+, Death 10+, Blast 11+, Implements 12+, Spells 13+

**Class Powers:** Battlefield Prowess, Manual of Arms.

**Proficiencies:** Adventuring, Command, Diplomacy, Intimidation, Leadership, Military Strategy 2, Mounted Combat.

**Languages:** Argollëan, Classical Auran, Common, Krysean, Classical Auran, Argollëan.

**Equipment:** *sword +1,* dagger, *shield +1*, *plate armor +1,* light helmet, dark red silk cloak, dark red and gold silk tunic and pants, embossed leather belt, high leather boots, short leather gloves, backpack with *2 healing salves, potion of swift sword, potion of slashing protection,*  purse (100gp, 100sp), enc. 6 3/6 st.

**Mount:** Medium warhorse, war saddle and tack, saddlebag, blanket, mess kit, tinderbox, 6 torches, waterskin, 1 week iron rations.

**Mercenaries:** 60 light infantry, 30 light infantry, 30 composite bowmen.

**Background:** A veteran of the Auran cavalry cohorts, Drakon left the legions to begin a career as an adventurer and mercenary in Rorn. After years of profitable warfare, he has now advanced to become mercenary captain of his own company, the Drakonian Guard. Drakon has brought his new company to the Borderlands in search of work. With the Tarkaun stripping the imperial garrisons to the bone for his war with Skysos, the Chthonic powers of the Wastes are stretching forth once more, and should the border forts fall, not only the Borderlands but even Southern Argollë could fall before them. Honor, glory, and plenty loot — what more could a captain of mercenaries wish for? The answer, surprisingly enough, is to serve Ammonar — for Drakon knows full well the danger that the dark powers in the south pose. Be it the vampire Acastus or the fell mage Dairin, Drakon takes pride in the roster of foul enemies of civilization slain by his hand.

**Description:** Drakon is a handsome, well-built Krysean man with light olive skin, wavy black hair, and dark eyes. He is somewhat slender for a fighter, but no one who meets his steely gaze could ever mistake him as weak. In front of his troops he always maintains a sense of professional decorum and military bearing, but in private he enjoys swapping ribald jokes and war-stories with his friends Dorvik and Aisluwen.

###### Dorvik

**6th level Dwarven Vaultguard** (commissioned by Emil Westenius)

**Stat Line:** AC 12, Spd 20’/60’, HP 36, ATK 1 (+1 *battle axe* 4+), Dmg 1d6+7, Init +2, Surprise 0 (+1 underground), ML +3, AL Lawful

**Attributes:** STR 18, INT 8, WIL 14, DEX 16, CON 14, CHA 10

**Saving Throws:** Paralysis 5+, Death 6+, Blast 8+, Implements 8+, Spells 9+

**Class Powers:** Battlefield Prowess, Dwarf Tongues, Hardy, Manual of Arms, Sensitivity to Rock and Stone.

**Proficiencies:** Adventuring, Command, Dungeonbashing Expertise, Endurance, Fighting Style Specialization (weapon & shield), Leadership.

**Languages:** Common, Dwarvish (Jutting dialect), Gnome, Goblin, Kobold.

**Equipment:** *battle axe +1*, hand axe, masterwork shield (+1 AC), *plate armor +1*, dark red wool cloak, dark red and gold armiger’s tunic and pants, embossed leather belt, low leather boots, short leather gloves, backpack with *2 potions of cure light injury, 2 oils of sharpness,* purse (100gp, 100sp), enc. 7 2/6 st.

**Mount:** Medium warhorse, war saddle and tack, saddlebag with blanket, mess kit, tinderbox, 6 torches, waterskin, 1 week iron rations.

**Background:** Dorvik hails from the far-off Jutting Mountains, and expected to live and die on those northern slopes like his fathers before him — but fate intervened. During a pitched battle against beastmen that were rampaging through Rornish and Dwarvish territory, Dorvik’s life was saved by the mercenary Drakon. After the battle, Dorvik’s clan chieftain ordered him to travel with Drakon on a warrior’s pilgrimage. Though not particularly bright, Dorvik is stubborn and loyal to a fault, a paragon of dwarven warfare. He has fought besides his human friend for many seasons now. His immense strength and sheer tenacity has earned him wealth and respect in equal measure, and far beyond what he had ever dreamed.

**Description:** Dorvik is sometimes said to be built like a bear, but that description is actually an understatement: He is both more muscular and more hirsute than any bear. He wears a set of fine dwarven plate-and-mail with breastplate and greaves. Dorvik’s belly-length beard carefully braided with trophies of his many victories.

###### Plutonius

**6th level Fighter** (commissioned by Chris)

**Stat Line:** AC 8, Spd 30’ / 90’, HP 34, ATK 1 (*+1 sword* & *+1 mace* 0+), Dmg 1d6+7 / 1d8+7, Init +3, Surprise +1, ML +3, AL Neutral

**Attributes:** STR 18, INT 11, WIL 16, DEX 16, CON 13, CHA 12

**Saving Throws:** Paralysis 8+, Death 9+, Blast 10+, Implements 11+, Spells 12+

**Class Powers:** Battlefield Prowess, Manual of Arms.

**Proficiencies:** Adventuring, Combat Ferocity, Combat Reflexes,Endurance, Fighting Style Specialization (dual weapons), Riding.

**Languages:** Common, Krysean.

**Equipment****:** *sword +1*, *mace +1*, dagger, masterwork lamellar armor (+1 AC), dark red wool cloak, leather tunic and pants, embossed leather belt, high leather boots, short leather gloves, backpack with *2 potions of cure light injury, potion of fire resistance, potion of levitation*, purse (100gp, 100sp), enc. 6 3/6 st.

**Mount:** Medium warhorse, war saddle and tack, saddlebag with blanket, mess kit, tinderbox, 6 torches, waterskin, 1 week iron rations.

**Background:** A headstrong warrior from the mountains of Krysea, Plutonius is a true sellsword, having fought for a number of mercenary companies and all manner of employers from Opelenea to Southern Argollë. With the Auran Empire’s forces stretched thin by the war against the barbarians of Skysostan, and beastmen stirring in the Waste, Plutonius knows the Borderlands are in dire straits. A veteran mercenary, he knows full well that where there is strife there is also plenty of coin to be made, and has made his way to the embattled region to enlist in Drakon’s legion. Whatever the fate of the Borderlands happens to be, Plutonius intends to emerge from it with wealth enough that even a man with his prodigious appetites can afford to retire to a life of plenty.

**Description:** With his bushy brows, chest-length beard, and sturdy build, Plutonius could easily be mistaken for a dwarf —– if dwarves ever stood 6’4” tall. A man of great mirth and great melancholy, Plutonius believes that fortune favors the bold. He has a loud laugh and stentorian voice that carries across battlefields and beer-houses alike. He is fond of mocking the self-important Lazlo Dragonbane, and laughs off the hyperbolic threats that the Nicean swordsman offers in return.

###### Lazlo Dragonbane

**6th level Assassin** (commissioned by Alex Mooney)

**Stat Line:** AC 9, Spd 10’ / 30’, HP 24, ATK 1 (*Blood-drinker* & masterwork Short Sword 1+ or masterwork crossbow 3+), Dmg 1d6+6 / 1d8+6 or 1d6+3, Init +4, Surprise +1, ML +2, AL Neutral

**Attributes:** STR 16, INT 10, WIL 10, DEX 18, CON 9, CHA 9

**Saving Throws:** Paralysis 10+, Death 11+, Blast 12+, Implements 13+, Spells 14+

**Class Powers:** Backstab (2 dice), Hiding 14+, Shadowy Senses, Sneaking 12+, Streetwise.

**Proficiencies:** Adventuring, Armor Training, Combat Reflexes, Disguise, Fighting Style (dual weapons), Manual of Arms.

**Languages:** Common, Nicean.

**Equipment:** *Blood-Drinker (sword +1),* masterwork short sword (+1/0), masterwork dagger (+1/0), masterwork crossbow (+1/0), case with 20 bolts, plate armor, dark grey silk cloak, dark grey silk tunic and pants, embossed leather belt, high leather boots, short leather gloves, backpack with *potion of discern invisible, potion of levitation, potion of spider climbing, potion of swimming,* dose of giant centipede poison, dose of foxglove poison, dose of carrion horror poison, purse (100gp, 100sp).

**Mount:** Medium horse, riding tack and saddle, saddlebag with blanket, mess kit, tinderbox, 6 torches, waterskin, 1 week iron rations.

**Background:** Lazlo Dragonbane, as he styles himself, is a native of Nicea who has only recently arrived in the Borderlands. He affects a self-important air and claims to be a former officer in the Auran legions who earned his commission by slaying a dragon. Though he wears a full set of Auran plate armor and is well acquainted with the finer points of legionary etiquette, his agile fighting style, ample use of poison, and mysterious Zaharan sword suggest his supposed career might be a cover for a more sinister line of work —– perhaps even in the Emperor’s Talons. The curious mercenaries of Drakon’s company have amply plied him with bottles of wine in hopes of learning more, but Lazlo has remained tight-lipped about what he was up to before joining.

**Description:** Lazlo is a curly-haired Nicean man with dark, predatory eyes, ropy muscles, and an almost feline grace. His sword, *Blood-Drinker,* is a backwards-curved Zaharan blade that absorbs any blood that lands on its unnaturally cold blade, ensuring every kill is clean. He rarely unsheathes it, except to threaten the bombastic fighter Plutonius when he engages in another round of puerile humor.

###### Aisluwen

**6th level Antiquarian Witch** (commissioned by Brad Mitchell)

**Stat Line:** AC 2, Spd 40’ / 120’, HP 17, ATK 1 (Staff 9+), Dmg 1d6, Init +1, ML +2, AL Neutral

**Mount:** Light horse, riding tack and saddle, saddlebag with blanket, mess kit, tinderbox, 6 torches, waterskin, 1 week iron rations.

**Background:** Aisluwen first demonstrated her gift for divine healing as a child in Rorn, when she healed the wounds of her father’s sheepdog. Soon thereafter she began learning the art of witchcraft from the reclusive crone who lived on the outskirts of her hamlet. She proved a natural, with a strong and deep connection to the spirits of the land, and a remarkable facility with healing the sick and wounded. Word of her skill attracted the interest of Rornish mercenaries, who recruited her to serve as their company’s healer. There, she struck up a friendship with the fighter Drakon and the vaultguard Dorvik. She has accompanied her two friends to the Borderlands, where her witchcraft ably serves the Drakonian Guard. Lately, however, she has begun to give thought to abandoning the mercenary life, and is spending more and more time in the hamlets and villages, building good will with the common folk.

**Description:** Aisluwen is slight, pale skinned with a dusting of almost red freckles across her face and nose. She has extremely long, curly red hair, and vivid green eyes. A true neutral in a world embattled by law and chaos, she cares little for the struggles of gods and heroes. She is, however, fiercely loyal to her friends and magnanimous with her arts towards those in need.

**Holdings:** Stone townhouse (2,250gp value), arcane library (6,000gp value).

**Background:** Native to Northern Argollë, Sherian Ui Siollan established a home for herself in the city of Cyfaraun several years ago. Under the name Sherian Lizardtongue, she took up a position as a sage at the Tower of Knowledge, specializing in the ancient history of the Elves and Thrassians. Recently, she has stumbled upon disturbing evidence that suggests that the elves might not be the innocent victims of Thrassian rapacity that they are portrayed to be in her people’s annals. Troubled by this possibility, she has taken a temporary leave of absence from her post and joined the Drakonian Guard. She hopes that during her travels with the mercenaries, she will have an opportunity to investigate the ancient and dangerous elven ruins found throughout the Borderlands. Even to herself, she has not yet admitted whether she seeks to learn from the mistakes of the past… or repeat them.

**Description:** Sherian is a slimly built elven woman who stands 5’1” and weighs 109 lbs. She wears her platinum hair in a long braid past her waist. Her light violet eyes are large and wide-set above a fine-featured face with full lips. Sherian carries the *lantern of perpetual illumination,* a beautifully carved silver lamp without wick or fuel that emits continuous soft white light from a polished spherical stone held securely in place. Her cohorts believe the *lantern* is an elven relic of antiquity and power, but in truth Sherian simply cast *perpetual* *illumination* on a stone and put it in a fancy silver case.

## The Prophet’s Entourage

The power of faith compels the prophet Alanyi Bin Deri and his entourage to undertake a desperate struggle to prevent the terrible fate Alanyi has foreseen in the Borderlands.

###### Alanyi bin Deri

**3rd level Crusader** (commissioned by Delian Teak)

**Stat Line:** AC 6, Spd 20’ /to 60’, HP 11, ATK 1 (Masterwork Mace 8+), Dmg 1d6/1d8, Init 0, ML +1, AL Lawful

**Attributes:** STR 9, INT 11, WIL 18, DEX 12, CON 9, CHA 16

**Saving Throws:** Paralysis 9+, Death 6+, Blast 12+, Implements 9+, Spells 11+

**Class Powers:** Performance (Oration), Rebuke Undead.

**Proficiencies:** Adventuring, Diplomacy, Prophecy.

**Languages:** Common Auran, Opelenean.

**Spellcasting:** Caster Level 3, Spells per Day 2 1st, 1 2nd.

**Spell Repertoire:** Crusader Spell Repertoire.

**Equipment:** Masterwork mace (+1/0), masterwork shield (+1 AC), chain mail, grey linen cassock, hemp sandals, hemp belt, holy symbol (winged sun of Ammonar), backpack with *potion of discern evil,* purse (20gp, 20sp).

**Mount:** Medium horse, riding tack and saddle, saddlebag with blanket, mess kit, tinderbox, 6 torches, waterskin, 1 week iron rations

**Background:** From out of the Opelenean desert comes Alanyi bin Deri: a hermit, a prophet of Ammonar, and a man of unshakable conviction. For the last year, Alanyi has suffered from visions of orcs and humans clashing in bloody combat far to the east, in the Borderlands of the Empire. Alanyi can no more ignore the call from the gods than he can live without air itself. Marching east, Alanyi has collected a small entourage of adventurers eager to face the tides of darkness with him. Whether they fight for his righteous cause or for glory or plunder is less important than that they fight — for Alanyi knows that if he fails, a reign of chaos such as the world has not seen in millennia will sweep across all of Cybele…

**Description:**  Alanyi is a medium-statured man with medium brown skin, wavy black hair, almond-shaped hazel eyes, and a well-kept curly black beard. Though not physically striking, his rich baritone voice impresses crowds when he speaks. He dresses humbly, in a loose linen cassock with woven belt and sandals.

**Notes:** Alanyi has Performance (Oration) in place of Theology to represent the fact that he is not a conventionally trained crusader. He has avoided censure thus far due to the gift of prophecy, but clashes with orthodox Empyrean clergy are likely to be a fixture wherever he goes. Unorthodox in his understanding of Ammonar, he is likely to take Syncretism if he advances in level.

###### Fingara

**3rd level Venturer** (commissioned by 2econd).

**Stat Line:** AC 2, Spd 30’ /to 90’, HP 10, ATK 1 (Masterwork Shortbow 7+), Dmg 1d6, Init +1, ML +1, AL Lawful

**Attributes:** STR 7, INT 10, WIL 9, DEX 13, CON 9, CHA 16

**Saving Throws:** Paralysis 12+, Death 12+, Blast 12+, Implements 13+, Spells 14+

**Class Powers:** Bribery, Diplomacy, Expert Bargaining, Expert Traveling, Mercantile Network, Multilingual, Pathfinding, Steady Trade Route, Treachery.

**Proficiencies:** Adventuring, Craft (Cooking), Precise Shooting.

**Languages:** Common, Classical Auran, Argollëan, Krysean, Nicean.

**Equipment:** Masterwork shortbow (+1/+1), quiver with 20 arrows, dagger, leather armor, hooded blue wool cloak, traveler’s tunic and pants, embossed leather belt, short leather boots, short leather gloves, backpack, *treasure map* (clay cuneiform tablet, TT B), journal, quill and ink, purse (20gp, 20sp), enc 3 2/6 st.

**Mount:** Medium horse, riding tack and saddle, saddlebag with blanket, mess kit, tinderbox, 6 torches, waterskin, 1 week iron rations

**Background:** A traveling merchant and baker, Fingara is a colorful and charming woman, who “has fingers in all the pies” as she likes to claim. This has admittedly left her with the nickname of the “Shitty Baker”, but in her inimitable style, Fingara has simply adopted the name — for all that her sweet pies are none too impressive, her meat pies are disturbingly good. Traveling through Southern Argollë, she met a peculiar prophet by the name of Alanyi, who convinced her to put her mercantile wiles to better use as a crusader for the Empyrean gods. Apparently, even those touched by the gods need to eat! For all her witty remarks and easygoing nature, Fingara knows too well the dangers the Chthonic raiders from the south pose, and is fully prepared to put her money where her mouth is to keep her country — and, more importantly, her customers — safe.

###### Inaya

**3rd level Bladedancer** (commissioned by Kevin Mattes)

**Stat Line:** AC 3, Spd 40’ / 120’, HP 12, ATK 1 (MW Short Swords 10+, or Spear 10+), Dmg 1d6 or 1d6/1d8, Init +2, ML +1, AL Lawful

**Attributes:** STR 11, INT 12, WIL 13, DEX 13, CON 9, CHA 13

**Saving Throws:** Paralysis 11+, Death 8+, Blast 14+, Implements 11+, Spells 13+

**Class Powers:** Graceful Fighting, Strength of Faith, Theology, Weapon Finesse.

**Proficiencies:** Adventuring, Blind-Fighting, Performance (dance).

**Languages:** Common, Classical Auran.

**Spellcasting:** Caster Level 3, Spells per Day 2 1st, 1 2nd.

**Spell Repertoire:** Bladedancer Spell Repertoire.

**Equipment:** Masterwork spear (+1/0), 2 masterwork short swords (+1/0), light arena armor, crimson silk cloak, crimson and gold chiton, gold silk sash, sandals, holy symbol (9-pointed star of Ianna), backpack with *potion of swift sword,* purse (20gp, 20sp), enc 3 4/6 st.

**Mount:** Light horse, riding tack and saddle, saddlebag with blanket, mess kit, tinderbox, 6 torches, waterskin, 1 week iron rations.

**Permanent Wounds**: Blind. Inaya’s blinded condition is partly ameliorated by her Blind-Fighting proficiency. If her blindness is cured, her attack throws will improve by 2 points and she will become able to make missile attacks.

**Background:** Inaya was born blind and abandoned to the care of the priestesses of Mityara in the Cyfaraun orphanage. The women who cared for her expected she would join the Keepers of the Hearth Fire, but their inability to cure her affliction led her to doubt their teachings. Instead, the fiery young woman committed to becoming a bladedancer of Ianna. For years, she was turned away by the Temple of the Blade and Veil, but Inaya diligently practiced the art of blind-fighting until her prowess was enough for the goddess to deem her fit for service. After several years as an itinerant bladedancer, she joined the entourage of the strange prophet Alanyi bin Deri when he told her “you are blind because the light of the Empyrean gods shines so brightly on you.” Perhaps due to her Mityaran upbringing, Inaya refuses to kill humans and demi-humans, even those who deserve it.

###### Norden Domekh

**3rd level Dwarven Fury** (commissioned by North Scorpion)

**Stat Line:** AC 4, Spd 40’ / 120’, HP 16, ATK 1 (Masterwork Battle Axe 8+), Dmg 1d6+4 / 1d8+4, Init 0, Surprise 0 (+1 underground), ML +2, AL Lawful

**Attributes:** STR 16, INT 10, WIL 10, DEX 10, CON 10, CHA 17

**Saving Throws:** Paralysis 8+, Death 9+, Blast 11+, Implements 11+, Spells 12+

**Class Powers:** Dwarf Tongues, Fighting Fury, Flesh-Runes (DR 1), Hardy, Intimidation, Savage Resilience, Sensitivity to Rock & Stone.

**Proficiencies:** Adventuring, Combat Ferocity, Fighting Style (weapon & shield), Intimidation, Manual of Arms.

**Languages:** Common, Dwarvish, Kobold, Gnome, Goblin.

**Equipment:** Masterwork battle axe (+1/0), dagger, masterwork shield (+1 AC), hooded grey wool cloak, leather tunic and pants, embossed leather belt, short leather boots, short leather gloves, backpack with *oil of sharpness,* purse (20gp, 20sp), enc. 1 4/6 st.

**Mount:** Mule, riding tack and saddle, saddlebag with blanket, mess kit, tinderbox, 6 torches, waterskin, 1 week iron rations.

**Background:** The dwarves are known as a stubborn people, with a grimly defensive mindset that has seen them endure where men and elves would have broken long ago. But the furies, blood-sworn avengers of dwarvenkind, are the exception that tests this rule. Norden is one such fury. Driven by a dream of glorious battle against Chthonic forces, Norden has undertaken a warrior’s pilgrimage to the Borderlands. There he has joined the entourage of the divine prophet Alanyi bin Deri. Though he has great faith in his gods and ancestors, Norden knows little of the Empyrean religion. He is only slowly beginning to realize that his friend Alanyi’s teachings might not be entirely orthodox...

**Description:** Norden is a thickly-muscled dwarf with a shaven scalp, a chest-length dark beard, and an impressively broken nose set below bright, almost crazed, eyes. Adding to his fearsome presence are the countless flesh-runes that have been inked across his face, scalp, arms, and torso, marred here and there by sword-cuts and scars. Although he tries to be kind and agreeable in his own way, Norden has a certain unpredictable energy that terrifies his enemies — and, sometimes, his allies.

**Note:** The dwarven fury class is from our dwarf sourcebook ***By This Axe****.* Judges without access to the sourcebook can use Norden as a vaultguard instead by changing Fighting Style Specialization to Berserkergang and equipping him with heavy armor.

###### Sigrún Wave-Rider

**3rd level Jutland Barbarian** (commissioned by DR)

**Stat Line:** AC 6, Spd 20’ / 60’, HP 15, ATK 1 (Masterwork Battle Axe 8+), Dmg 1d6/1d8+2, Init +1, ML +1, AL Neutral

**Attributes:** STR 16, INT 13, WIL 10, DEX 10, CON 10, CHA 17

**Saving Throws:** Paralysis 12+, Death 13+, Blast 14+, Implements 15+, Spells 16+

**Class Powers:** Animal Reflexes, Climbing, Savage Resilience, Seafaring.

**Proficiencies:** Adventuring, Command, Fighting Style (Weapon & Shield), Seafaring 3.

**Languages:** Common, Jutlandic, Dwarvish (Jutting dialect).

**Equipment:** Masterwork battle axe (+1/0), dagger, masterwork shield (+1 AC), chain mail, hooded navy-blue silk cloak, fine leather tunic and pants, embossed leather belt, tall leather boots, long leather gloves, backpack, *potion of swimming,* purse (20gp, 20sp).

**Mount:** Medium horse, riding tack and saddle, saddlebag with blanket, mess kit, tinderbox, 6 torches, waterskin, 1 week iron rations.

**Background:** A harsh place at the best of times, Jutland provides the Auran Empire with a seemingly endless supply of hardy warriors and adventurers, and Sigrún Wave-Rider is no exception. Lacking in conventional beauty and with the kind of hotheaded attitude and temper that made marrying her off an impossibility, Sigrún found her father was only too happy to let her go off and seek a glorious death in combat — and the farther away from the other rulers he was trying to delicately outmaneuver, the better. Sigrún cheerfully set sail for the Krysea, and hearing of trouble in the Borderlands, made her way there in search of plunder and glory. Along the way she fell in with a man by the name of Alanyi bin Deri, who claimed to have been touched by the gods. He is certainly… touched…. But Sigrún cares little for such matters. What she does care about is loot — and fighting alongside the dark-skinned crusader has certainly resulted in plenty of gold! Soon, she’ll have the funds she needs to buy a galley with good oars and plunder distant shores.

**Description:** Sigrún is a Jutlandic woman with a thickly-muscled physique, violet eyes, and platinum blonde hair she wears tied into a long braid. No one would describe her as beautiful, but she is nevertheless formidable and unforgettable. Despite the warm weather of the Borderlands, she continues to dress in the Jutlandic style, with a mail byrnie beneath a fur-lined cloak.

## The Grey Brotherhood

Twenty-five years ago, the Grey Brotherhood was a company of adventure renowned for its glorious deeds throughout the Meniri Mountains. Today, the company consists of the children of the original members. What they lack in experience and knowledge, they make up for with high morale and unshakeable camaraderie.

The Grey Brotherhood was designed to include one of each of the six core classes, making it a great party to use for a quick-start campaign or one-off introduction to ***ACKS II****.* The ongoing exploits of the Grey Brotherhood can be seen on Autarch’s YouTube channel.

###### Andravus Iskarian

**1st level Explorer** (played by Jonathan Oldenburg)

**Stat Line:** AC 4, Spd 20’ / 60’, HP 7, ATK 1 (long bow 9+, short sword and dagger 9+, or spear 10+), Dmg 1d6+1, 1d6+1, or 1d8+1, Init +2, ML +1, AL Lawful

**Attributes:** STR 12, INT 11, WIL 10, DEX 13, CON 14, CHA 16

**Saving Throws:** Paralysis 13+, Death 14+, Blast 15+, Implements 16+, Spells 17+

**Class Powers:**  Alertness, Ambushing, Animal Reflexes, Endurance, Evasion, Pathfinding, Natural Stealth

**Proficiencies:** Adventuring, Precise Shooting, Tracking

**Languages:** Common, Nicean

**Equipment:** Sturdy long bow, quiver with 20 arrows, spear, short sword, dagger, scale armor, wind-battered fur cloak, wool tunic and pants, leather belt, low boots, backpack, lantern, tinderbox, 1 flask of common oil, blanket, 50’ rope, 12 iron spikes, small hammer, waterskin, 1 week’s iron rations (enc. 9 5/6 st)

**Background:** Born in a rural Tirenean village near the forest, Andravus dreamed of being a scout in the Legion from an early age. Though his parents encouraged him to pursue an independent path, Andravus enlisted when he came of age. He was soon drummed out of the legion after running afoul of a corrupt centurion. It was enough experience, though, to realize that his father had been right all along both in this and in his warning that Aura was being eaten apart from the inside by corruption. Andravus became a free-ranging pathfinder in the interior wilds of Nicea. He was on one such foray when he got word that his father’s old company of adventure, the Grey Brotherhood, was being reformed.

**Description:** Andravus is of middling height with a lanky build. He has blue-grey eyes, ash brown hair, and light olive skin that is heavily weathered by wind and sun. Though explorers are often dour and gruff, Andravus is an affable fellow that wins friends easily.

###### Avaris Mac Cade

**1st level Thief** (played by James Young)

**Stat Line:** AC 3, Spd 20’ / 60’, HP 4, ATK 1 (short bow 9+, Short sword and dagger 9+), Dmg 1d6, Init +1, ML 0, AL Neutral

**Attributes:** STR 11, INT 10, WIL 9, DEX 13, CON 13, CHA 16

**Saving Throws:** Paralysis 13+, Death 13+, Blast 13+, Implements 14+, Spells 15+

**Class Powers:**  Climbing 6+, Hiding 19+, Listening 14+, Lockpicking 18+, Pickpocket 17+, Searching 16+ Sneaking 17+, Trapbreaking 16+

**Proficiencies:** Adventuring, Mapping, Trapfinding

**Languages:** Common, Rornish

**Equipment:** Short bow, quiver with 20 arrows, 10’ pole, short sword, throwing dagger, sturdy leather armor, tanned brown cloak, thick tunic and pants, leather belt, low boots, backpack, 2 large treasure sacks, thieves’ tools, 50’ rope, tinderbox, lantern, small hammer, 12 iron spikes, 2 flasks of common oil, 2 flasks of military oil, wineskin, 1 week’s iron rations, 4gp (enc. 8 st)

**Background:** Avaris’s father, Cade, sired him on a harlot who worked in one of Cyfaraun’s many brothels. Cade was largely absent from Avaris’s life for over a decade, but he made sure to divert funds from his adventuring exploits to give him a comfortable childhood. Around the time Avaris became a teenager, his father retired from adventuring and sought him out. Cade began to teach Avaris the tradecraft of the thief. Though Avaris proved skillful in executing hijinks with his father, he aspired to greater deeds. When the Grey Brotherhood was re-established, Avaris saw his chance to prove his worth.

**Description:** Avaris is a lean man with narrow eyes and bland appearance, apart from a devilish smile that occasionally flashes when he has pulled off a hijink. He favors non-descript clothes that don’t attract attention.

###### Castinus Acrodynas

**1st level Venturer** (played by Sean Falconi)

**Stat Line:** AC 2, Spd 30’ / 90’, HP 5, ATK 1 (crossbow 10+ or short sword and dagger 9+), Dmg 1d6, Init +0, ML 0, AL Neutral

**Attributes:** STR 9, INT 9, WIL 9, DEX 10, CON 10, CHA 16

**Saving Throws:** Paralysis 13+, Death 13+, Blast 13+, Implements 14+, Spells 15+

**Class Powers:**  Bribery, Diplomacy, Expert Bargaining, Expert Traveling, Mercantile Network, Multilingual, Pathfinding, Treachery

**Proficiencies:** Adventuring, Alertness, Driving, Navigation

**Languages:** Common, Classical Auran, Elvish, Dwarvish, Goblin

**Equipment:** Crossbow, case with 20 bolts, short sword, 2 throwing daggers, sturdy leather armor, tanned brown cloak, thick tunic and pants, leather belt, high boots, backpack, large treasure sack, 50’ rope, tinderbox, lantern, small hammer, 12 iron spikes, flask of common oil, flask of military oil, waterskin, 1 week’s iron rations, 1gp (enc. 6 3/6 st)

**Background:** Castinus was born into a family of merchants that has done business in the Borderlands for generations – though not always successfully. After incurring disastrous losses in the spice trade, Castinus’ father Paternus founded the original Grey Brotherhood in a desperate attempt to regain his wealth. To Paternus’s surprise, the Grey Brotherhood proved highly profitable. With the plunder earned on over a decade of exploits, Paternus was able to rebuild the family’s trading business into a thriving enterprise. Recently, the family caravan has headed west, to support the legions fighting the Skysos. Castinus has stayed behind in order to re-form his father’s old adventuring company with his childhood friends.

**Description:** Castinus maintains high standards of clothing and appearance. His build is average for Auran society, and lean from a lifetime of travel and hustle on the road. Before he became an adventurer, Castinus was a highly social “man about town.” Having nearly died several times, an air of grit and pragmatism has set in him. While still able to negotiate and build financial relationships, he is increasingly looking to violently punish the enemies of law, commerce and the empire.

###### Hyglak Halfhand

**1st level Fighter** (played by Grant Sinclair)

**Stat Line:** AC 4, Spd 30’ / 90’, HP 6, ATK 1 (great axe 7+ or thrown axe 10+), Dmg 1d10+4 or 1d6+4, Init +0, ML +1, AL Neutral

**Attributes:** STR 18, INT 8, WIL 7, DEX 10, CON 10, CHA 9

**Saving Throws:** Paralysis 14+, Death 15+, Blast 16+, Implements 17+, Spells 18+

**Class Powers:**  Manual of Arms

**Proficiencies:** Adventuring, Berserkergang, Endurance

**Languages:** Common, Juttish

**Equipment:** Great axe, hand axe, chain mail armor, thick wool cloak, wool tunic and pants, leather belt, low boots, belt pouch, small sack, waterskin, 1 week’s iron rations (enc. 6 4/6 st)

**Background:** Hyglak Hergerson is the son of Herger, one of the original Grey Brothers. Following his retirement from the Brotherhood, Herger returned north to his home amongst the Jutland raiders and started a family. Herger trained his children in the Auran arts of war, creating fighters with civilized skill and barbarian courage. Hyglak, the third son, chaffed under his father’s and elder brother’s rule of the family assets and desired to earn his own name. With his father’s blessing, he headed south to join with the sons of his father’s former mercenary company to seek fortune and glory.

**Description:** Hyglak is tall and well-muscled with a harsh, chiseled face. He has bright grey eyes almost hidden by an unkempt mane of ruddy brown hair and full beard. In civilized company, his lack of manners is balanced by his love of ale and a good time. In battle, his recklessness is only barely restrained by the discipline of his father’s training. Early on, he earned the name “Halfhand” from his propensity to lose fingers in battle.

###### Raemon Ouras

**1st level Crusader** (played by Grant Sinclair)

**Stat Line:** AC 7, Spd 20’ / 60’, HP 6, ATK 1 (mace 10+), Dmg 1d6 Init +1, ML +1, AL Lawful

**Attributes:** STR 12, INT 10, WIL 15, DEX 13, CON 13, CHA 16

**Class Powers:**  Divine Magic (1 1st), Rebuke Undead, Theology

**Proficiencies:** Divine Blessing, Theology 2

**Background:** Raemon the Elder – better known as the Sideral Stallion – was a gregarious bard of Nicean and Opelenean descent who served as the herald of the original Grey Brotherhood. He had hoped his namesake, Raemon the Younger, would follow in his footsteps and become a man of lore and song. Instead, the young Raemon fell under the influence of his uncle, Horatio the Hammer, who had served as a crusader in battles across the Ammas Aurë. To honor his father’s legacy, Raemon has joined the re-established Grey Brotherhood; but he carries with him his uncle’s pious spiritual fire to spread the Empyrean faith and utterly crush evil underfoot.

**Description:** Raemon is a tall and imposing man with a handsome face and well-muscled body with dark bronze skin and wavy ebon hair. Those who confront him in his crusader panoply face a veritable wall of iron and sinew.

###### Tirenius Orn

**1st level Mage** (played by William Macris)

**Stat Line:** AC 0, Spd 40’ / 120’, HP 4, ATK 1 (staff 10+ or dart 10+), Dmg 1d6 or 1d4, Init +0, ML +1, AL Neutral

**Attributes:** STR 9, INT 16, WIL 9, DEX 9, CON 9, CHA 10

**Saving Throws:**

**Class Powers:**  Arcane Magic (1 1st), Collegiate Wizardry

**Proficiencies:** Elementalism (air), Alchemy 2, Naturalism

**Languages:** Common, Classical Auran

**Spellcasting:** Caster Level 1; Spells per day: 1 1st.

**Spell Repertoire:** 1st – *slumber, thunderclap, weave smoke*.

**Equipment:** Wood-paneled spellbook, gnarled oaken quarterstaff, 5 darts, four-colored cassock with hood, embossed belt, low boots, backpack, quill and ink, waterskin, 1 week’s iron rations, 60gp (enc. 3 1/6 st)

**Background:** The only son of the wizard Zeodan, Tirenius was raised in the Tower of Knowledge in Aura. His costly apprenticeship was easily paid for by the plunder his father earned adventuring with the Grey Brotherhood. Tirenius proved an apt pupil with a predilection for calling on the power of the elemental sphere of air that earned him his robes at a young age. Though invited to stay on as a at the Tower, Tirenius had little desire to spend his life in perpetual study. Instead, he join the re-established Grey Brotherhood.

**Description:** Tirenius is a tall, husky man with curly hair and a long, pointed goatee that has gone prematurely grey. While air elementalists have a reputation for being as ever-changing and unpredictable as the wind, Tirenius’s personality is more akin to the darkening sky of a thunder storm – slow to arrive but inexorable and wrathful when it does.
