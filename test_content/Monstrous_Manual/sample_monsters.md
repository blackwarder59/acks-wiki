### Acanthaspis, Giant

The giant acanthaspis, also known as the giant assassin bug, is a horrific predator with a taste for fresh meat. When full grown, it measures about 10' long and weighs about 800 lbs, with six legs and a short segmented beak. The beak injects acidic enzymes into the bug’s victims, digesting them from the inside so their liquified innards can be sucked out like milk.

###### Combat

After killing a victim, the acanthaspis secures the corpse on its glossy black carapace with sticky secretions, wearing its victims as **corpse** **armor.** When first encountered, an acanthaspis will have secured 2d10 corpses to itself. Each corpse can absorb 1hp of damage before being destroyed. It takes 1 turn for an acanthaspis to secure a new corpse to itself.

When an acanthaspis successfully bites a creature, the creature struck must make a Paralysis saving throw. If the save succeeds, the attack deals 3d6 {P!} damage but has no other effect. If the save fails, the attack deals 3d6 {P!} damage and the creature is **grabbed**. The acanthaspis immediately injects the grabbed creature with digestive enzymes that deal 1d4 {A!} damage. While the creature remains grabbed, the acanthaspis can use its combat action to automatically deal another 1d4 {A!} damage to the creature each round. Once the acidic damage reduces the grabbed creature to 0 or fewer hp, the acanthaspis immediately sucks out its melted innards, killing it instantly.

If desperate or frustrated, an acanthaspis can spew a 30’ x 5’ line of **acidic spit**. Any creature in the area of effect must make a Blast saving throw. If the save fails, the creature takes 4d8 {A!} damage. If the save succeeds, it takes half that damage. One such attack depletes the acanthaspis’s acid supply for 6 hours, so it will only spit acid when reduced to fewer than half its hit points or when it has failed to grab an opponent.

###### Ecology

When acanthaspis are encountered in a wilderness nest, there is a 25% chance per creature that it will have 1d4 eggs buried nearby. Acanthaspis eggs have 1 hp and weigh 4/6 st. Acanthaspis nymphs are rarely found in nests, because the nymphs immediately disperse into the wild after they emerge from their eggs.

###### Spoils

A slain acanthaspis can be harvested with Animal Husbandry 2 for the following components useful in magic research:

* acid gland (4 2/6 st, 260gp, *rain of vitriol, vitriolic infusion*)
* antennae (2 st, 120gp, *locate animal/plant, locate object*)
* mandible (2 st, 120gp, *choking grip, halt humanoid*)

If not used for magic research, an acanthaspis’s mandibles fetch 18gp and weigh 2/6 st. Its armored hide fetches 80gp and weighs 2 1/6 st.

### Amphisbaena

Among the most perilous of desert denizens, amphisbaena are the offspring of an escaped sorcerous creation of times gone by, great snakes 30’ long with heads at each end of their sinuous bodies. An amphisbaena winds its intricately-patterned sand-colored body sideways across the sand, each head leading by turn, leaving great twisting tracks in its wake as it seeks prey to sate its appetite. Desert nomads claim the flesh of an amphisbaena is a potent aphrodisiac, and the monsters are frequently hunted for their components.

###### Combat

An amphisbaena attacks with two **venomous** bites, one from each, dealing 1d4 {!P} damage each. Any creature damaged by an amphisbaena’s bite must make a Death saving throw. If the save fails, the creature dies of poison 1d4+2 turns later.

An amphisbaena’s heads are rivalrous and actively struggle to keep prey away from the other head. Should both heads latch on to the same target, this can have disastrous consequences. If an amphisbaena successfully attacks the same target with both bites in the same attack routine, the struggle between the two heads **rends** the target for an additional 2d10 {Se!} damage. If this damage reduces the target to 0 hp or less, the target is torn limb from limb and instantly slain. The amphisbaena can cleave after rending a target with whichever bite dealt more damage.

In addition to biting prey, an amphisbaena can attack by constriction. A successful constriction attack deals 2d8 {B!} damage to the creature and **restrains** it. Thereafter, while the creature remains restrained, the amphisbaena can automatically deal 2d8 {B!} damage on its initiative each round to the restrained creature without having to make an attack throw. Doing so counts as the amphisbaena’s constriction attack.

###### Ecology

When amphisbaena are encountered in their dens, there is a 7% chance per amphisbaena that it is incubating 2d4 eggs. Amphisbaena eggs have 1 hp and weigh 1/6 st.

###### Spoils

A slain amphisbaena can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the following components useful in magic research:

* 2 fangs (4 st, 240gp, *poison, neutralize poison*)
* 2 spines (4 st, 240gp, *choking grip, iron maiden*)
* hunk of flesh (5 4/6 st, 340gp, *allure, enslave humanoid*)

If not used for magic research, an amphisbaena’s fangs fetch 4gp and weigh 1/6 st. Its venom (onset time 1d10 turns, +2 saving modifier, target suffers 4d4 {Po} damage on a failed Death saving throw) fetches 200gp and weighs 1/6 st.
