## NPC Miscellaneous Possessions

A random pocket is picked or purse is cut. A random body is searched. Sometimes there are the on-the-spot moments when inspiration can fail or we fall back on a quick random roll of coins found. But the contents of a purse, pocket, or pouch can be varied and sometimes surprising, possibly even spurring further adventure in some cases.

The following tables help generate the random items and coins found in the pockets and purses of NPCs. They do not provide notable gains in wealth at lower levels, but do provide a variety of other possible oddments or items of interest. Even results that seemingly make little sense can be justified as the last belongings of someone fallen on hard times, keepsakes, or belongings pilfered from others.

When using these tables, you should consider the profession and standard of living of the individual being stolen from or searched; this helps determine the quality of anything found and what items incidental items they are likely to be bearing. A bread roll found on a beggar, for example, could be a discarded, moldy crust, while that of a prosperous merchant could be a soft saffron roll in which berries and seeds have been baked.

To use these tables, roll on the Coinage table to determine loose change and then roll 1d2 times on Random Items table (1d3 for Affluent and above). From there, roll on the appropriate sub-tables as directed.

EXAMPLE: With the recent decree making halflings citizens of the Empire, a wave of bite-sized burglary has swept through Cyfaraun. Among these miscreants midgets is Hyacinth Took, as in “Hyacinth took my wallet.” Hyacinth has recently picked the pocket of Beorn, a Jutland adventurer with a Prosperous lifestyle. The Judge rolls to see what she’s found! First, he rolls for Coinage. A roll of 2d6 and 1d6x10 yields 9gp and 20sp. Next, he rolls 1d2 for the number of Random Items; the result is a 2. He rolls 1d100 twice on the Random Items table. The first roll is a 73, a Tool; the second is 41, an Oddment. On the Tools table, the roll is a 4 x 5 – a pot of paint. The Judge decides this is Jutlandic woad, used as war-paint. On the Oddments table, the roll is an 18, a stone/pebble. The Judge interprets this as a rune-stone carrying a Jutlandic rune. The Judge begins to ponder how he might tie this into the draugr tomb in ***Lairs & Encounters****,* but Hyacinth actually just throws it all away. She just likes stealing things.
