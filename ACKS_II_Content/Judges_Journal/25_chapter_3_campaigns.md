# Chapter 3: Campaigns

Ongoing ***ACKS***campaign tend towards a consistent but informal pace of around one adventure per game month. The month begins with the adventurers in a civilized area, from which they set off on an adventure. During the adventure, they suffer casualties and discover treasure, then return to civilization. They then rest for a few weeks to recover from their injuries, investigate the properties of their magical treasure, hire new recruits, etc. At higher levels, they also manage their domains, run their syndicates, or perform magical research during this time.

Just adventuring needs an initiative sequence to order play and an action system to guide what can be accomplished in a round, campaign play needs a campaign sequence to order play and an activities system to guide what can be accomplished in a day. Can a character recruit mercenaries while soliciting merchants? Can a character sell goods while training troops? How many henchmen can be recruited in a day? If a character can force march to travel 50% further, can he work overtime to do 50% more blood sacrifices in a day? Does expenditure on magical research occur before or after revenue is collected? These Campaign Play rules provide you a structure with which campaign activities each month can be handled as systematically as ***ACKS***handles actions every combat round and exploration every turn.
