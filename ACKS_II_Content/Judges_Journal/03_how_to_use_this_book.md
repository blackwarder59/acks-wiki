## How To Use This Book

The **Adventurer Conqueror King System Judges Journal** (**ACKS JJ**) incorporates material from our original **ACKS Core Rules**, **ACKS Player’s Companion**, **ACKS Lairs & Encounters**, **ACKS Heroic Fantasy Handbook**, **Axioms** magazine, and the book **Arbiter of Worlds**, as well as all-new material created for this new volume.

However, the ***ACKS Judges Journal*** is not a complete ruleset. It was designed for use in conjunction with the ***ACKS Imperial Imprint***and ***ACKS Monstrous Manual***. If you are an experienced gamemaster, you might be able to use much of the material in the ***ACKS Judges Journal***in conjunction with another D20-based fantasy game rules set and/or bestiary. However, no other game can match ***ACKS***for comprehensive sandbox play, so you will not be able to take advantage of all the mechanics herein unless you are playing ***ACKS***.

This book is divided into six parts, each with a number of chapters.

Part I, **Praxis**, introduces the art and science of gamemastering a fantasy sandbox campaign, and then presents the behind-the-scenes rules you need to be an ***ACKS***judge, including random encounters, campaign activities, treasure, magic items, and more.

Part II, **Construction**, gives you a step-by-step methodology for creating fantasy campaign settings. You’ll learn how to use the “top-down zoom-in” methodology to get your sandbox ready for play.

Part III, **Abstraction**, includes a number of optional game systems to abstractly handle ***ACKS***gameplay. When your players send out their henchmen to go on adventures or clear territory for their domains, these rules will let you quickly resolve things.

Part IV, **Customization***,* offers mechanics for creating custom classes, races, magic types, and spells. These chapters “open the hood” to the ***ACKS***game engine and let you tinker and tweak it to fit your campaign setting.

Part V, **Appendices**,provides supplemental information of use to judges.

Now grab your dice, gather your friends, and let the adventure begin!
