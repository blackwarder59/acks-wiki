## Item Loss from Damage

In ***ACKS II****,* certain spells (such as *shatter blade*), special maneuvers (such as Sunder), and monsters (such as slimes) can target and damage items, either automatically destroying them or forcing the wielder to make a saving throw. What ***ACKS II***does not account for is spillover damage that occurs when a creature is caught in the area of effect of damage. If you have a penchant for cruelty and/or realism, you can use these rules to impose item loss.

Anytime a creature is reduced -6hp or less by an area of effect attack against which it either received no saving throw or failed the saving throw, the creature’s carried and worn equipment is at risk of destruction. One stone of equipment will be destroyed at -6 hp, and another stone of equipment for each 6 additional damage. Treat each layer of clothing as 1 stone for these purposes. Use the Item Loss from Damage table, below, to determine the order in which equipment is lost. When multiple items are at risk, choose based on the circumstances or roll randomly.

Magic items receive a saving throw (of the type appropriate to the effect that caused the damage) to avoid destruction, saving with the adventurer’s progression and applying their bonus (if any) to the throw. Ordinary items are simply destroyed if 1 st or less. Items of 2 st or more are damaged proportional to their weight, reducing AC bonus granted if any by 1 per full stone damaged. If a heavy item’s damage is less than 1 stone, the damage is purely cosmetic and has no game effect.

| **Damaged from Front** | **Damaged from Flank / Rear** |
| Shield in hand (if any) | Equipment hanging from pack or back |
| Equipment worn/carried in hands or on torso | Equipment in backpack |
| Clothing worn over armor | Cloak or cape |
| Armor | Clothing worn under armor |
| Clothing worn under armor | Armor |
| Cloak or cape | Clothing worn over armor |
| Equipment in backpack | Equipment worn/carried in hands or on torso |
| Equipment hanging from pack or back | Shield in hand (if any) |

However, not every type of attack can damage every type of equipment. Use the Materials Destroyed by Damage Type table to decide if a particular item is vulnerable based on its primary material (use common sense). If a particular item is not vulnerable to the damage, skip that item when moving through the Item Loss from Damage table.

EXAMPLE: Andravus has just bene struck by a *fireball* that has reduced him to -18 hp. Therefore, he is at risk of three stone worth of items being destroyed. Because the damage type is fire, only ceramic, cloth, combustibles (e.g. oil), food, fur, horn, leather, paper, and wood items are at risk.

Assume he is carrying a wooden spear and shield and wearing an adventurer’s harness with 2 metal flasks of military oil, 2 metal flasks of holy water, and 2 wineskins; a leather belt with 2 belt pouches containing 50gp each; scale armor; a cloak; and a backpack containing 6 torches and 1 stone of food.

If Andravus were damaged from the front, he would lose the wooden shield (1 st); the wooden spear (1 st); the 2 flasks of military oil (2/6 st), the two leather wineskins (2/6 st), and then the belt pouch (1/6 st) and the adventurer’s harness (1/6 st). The metal flasks of holy water and the gold coins are metal and therefore undamaged by fire, though both would fall to the floor. Had he taken another 6 fire damage, Andravus’s scale armor would have been damaged, reducing its AC bonus from 3 to 2.

If Andravus were damaged from the rear, he would lose the backpack (1/6 st), the 6 torches (1 st), and the food (1 st). The cloak (1st) then takes 5/6 st of damage. It’s badly singed but still usable. Had he taken another 6 fire damage, Andravus’s cloak would be destroyed and his armor singed.
