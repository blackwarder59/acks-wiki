## Class Category Values

One of the most effective tools to create a distinct fantasy race is to adjust, modify, or limit the effects of the various class category values.

### Fighting Value

Races that are less than man-sized, such as gnomes and dwarves, might be prevented from using two-handed swords or longbows. This does not adjust the cost of the class’s racial value. If the race is so small that it cannot wield any large weapons at all, and must wield medium weapons with two-hands, this counts as the Short-Statured custom power (-0.5 power cost).

Races that prefer particular weapons might encode these preferences with limitations on choices for narrow or broad weapon selections. For instance, dwarves with narrow or broad weapon selections must include at least four axes, flails, hammers, and/or maces among their selections, while elves with narrow or broad weapon selections must include at least two bows, crossbows, swords, or daggers. Gnomes with narrow or broad weapon selections must include arbalests, crossbows, and war hammers among their selections. Halflings with narrow weapon selections are limited to choosing from bola, dagger, darts, hand axe, javelin, sling, short bow, short sword, while halflings with broad weapon selections can also choose battle axe, crossbow, mace, or sword. Racial weapon preferences do not adjust the cost of the class’s racial value.

Races that are pacifistic, small, or otherwise ill-equipped for melee combat may have their Fighting Value limited. For instance, Halflings cannot allocate more than 2 points to Fighting.

Races that have extraordinary fighting skills, or who often practice fighting in addition to another profession, might allow build points allocated to the Fighting Value to stack with build points allocated to the racial value for purposes of determining the class’s fighting ability. Add the effective values to find the class’s fighting abilities, up to a maximum of 4 points.

###### Divine Category

Fantasy races that lack a relationship or devotion to the divine might be forbidden from allocating build points to the Divine value, or limited in the number of points they can allocate. If the race’s racial value indicates something like its caste, the race might be limited in the number of points it can allocate to this category by its racial value. Limits on the Divine value do not adjust the cost of the class’s racial value.

Races that have an extraordinary relationship or devotion to the divine, or who often practice divine spellcasting in addition to another profession, might have a racial value that mimics the Divine category. This increases the cost of the racial value by the equivalent value of the benefit provided. For instance, if Race 4 provides the equivalent of Divine 2, the cost of Race 4 must be increased by the cost of Divine 2. However, it is not a good idea to have a racial value that stacks with the Divine category, as the Divine category costs are not linear.

Races that are mechanically-inclined and worship craftsmanship, such as dwarves, might gain the ability to create divine constructs when they reach 9th caster level. This is such a minor benefit that it does not add to the race’s XP cost, though such “freebies” should always be used sparingly.

Remember that races whose racial value mimics the Divine value should require Will 9 or higher.

###### Arcane Category

Fantasy races that lack innate magical abilities may be forbidden from allocating build points to the Arcane category, or limited in the number of points they can allocate. If the race’s racial value indicates something like its caste, the race may be limited in the number of points it can allocate to this category by its racial value. Limits on the Arcane value do not adjust the cost of the class’s racial value.

Races that exceed the spellcasting abilities of humans, or who often practice arcane spellcasting in addition to another profession, might allow build points allocated to the Arcane Value to stack with build points allocated to the racial value for purposes of determining the class’s arcane spellcasting ability.

Stacked racial and Arcane values can reach values of 5 or greater. If so, apply the following rules. When calculating number of spells available, round fractions of 1/2 or more up; round any smaller fractions down.

* **Arcane + Race = 5:** The class has the ability to cast spells and engage in magical research as a mage, with the class’s spells per level increased by 33%. The class uses its class level for all level-dependent spell ranges, durations, and damages; these are not increased.
* **Arcane + Race = 6:** As above, but the class’s spells per level are increased by 50%.
* **Arcane + Race = 7:** As above, but the class’s spells per level are increased by 66%.
* **Arcane + Race = 8:** As above, but the class’s spells per level are increased by 100%.

Stacking increases the cost of the racial value by the equivalent value of the benefit provided. For instance, if Race 4 provides the equivalent of Arcane 2, the cost of Race 4 must be increased by the cost of Arcane 2.

Note that it is possible for a fantasy race to be forbidden from selecting the Arcane value while simultaneously having a racial value that stacks with Arcane. For instance, gnomes may never allocate build points to the Arcane category, but gnomes may gain the ability to cast arcane spells by allocating points to the Gnome Value.

### Custom Powers for your Fantasy Race

Custom powers for your fantasy race can be selected from the **Custom Power Index** in the Custom Classes chapter, or built using the rules for **Creating New Custom Powers** found in the same chapter. Except as noted below, they function exactly like class custom powers.

###### Cost of Racial Custom Powers

Some Judges will have noticed that, if they calculate the cost per custom power from the Fighting or Thievery value, it typically costs 67 to 150 XP per power. Why, then, is the default cost just 40 XP to acquire a custom power for a race?

The reason is that races are intended to serve as the chassis for multiple classes. Therefore, the racial powers should be more general in nature and less specifically useful to any given class. They are costed with a discount to reflect the fact that a typical character will find its class custom powers more important in play than its racecustom powers.

However, sometimes racial powers do apply directly to the class’s function. If a particular race tends to specialize in only one type of class, and the racial powers are directly applicable to the function of that class, then you should charge 75, 100, or even 150 XP per racial power to maintain balance. The Halfling Skills gained from Halfling 1 – 4 cost 75 XP each, for instance, as they are specially chosen to compliment the type of classes and functions that halflings fulfill in the game, and for balance purposes cannot be costed at less than equivalent Thievery value skills.

Powers such as Child-Like or Inhuman, which apply both a bonus and a penalty to reactions with specific creatures, are typically costed at 0 custom powers.

###### Cost of Racial Spell-Like Abilities

A related issue is the cost of spell-like abilities. Spell-like abilities taken as racial powers cost at least 70 XP each, more as the spell level increases. This escalating cost is contrary to the approach taken in the Custom Class chapter*,* where spell-like abilities count as one custom power each as long as they follow the usage limits (1st level spells usable at will with a casting time of 1 turn, etc.).

However, the Custom Class chapteralso specifies that “spell-like abilities should generally not appear as a class power at a level of experience lower than the spell’s level.” Racial spell-like abilities violate this rule, as the example of the gnome race shows: 1st level gnomes can begin play with 2nd level spell-like abilities. The special rules for costing racial spell-like abilities are intended to reflect this.
