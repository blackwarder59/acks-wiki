## Encumbrance

The encumbrance rules in ***ACKS II***have three purposes. First, they limit the amount of supplies or treasure that adventurers can carry, creating logistical challenges. Second, they impose a realistic disadvantage on heavily-armored combatants, making them move slower than lightly-equipped skirmishers. Finally, they serve as a benchmark to assess the difficulty of certain tasks, such as squeezing through narrow chokepoints. What the rules do not do is closely model exactly how an adventurer carries his goods, instead relying on common sense. Unfortunately, in the absence of a hard rule, some players of a “gamist” mindset have been known to try to equip their characters in implausible ways. The following guidelines are intended to help you, the Judge, make rulings where necessary on such matters.

An adventurer can carry:

* Held in his hand, one item or weapon with an encumbrance of 1 st or less, or not more than 100 coins or gems.
* Hanging on his back, either a backpack or a shield *or* two of the following: quiver/case, rucksack, weapon (any size).
* Hanging from a backpack or rucksack, any four items or weapons each with an encumbrance of 1/6 st or less, excluding other backpacks, harnesses, or rucksacks.
* Hanging from an adventurer’s harness, any six items, sets of items, or weapons each with an encumbrance of 1/6 st or less, excluding backpacks, harnesses, rucksacks, or sacks. An adventurer’s harness cannot be worn over heavy armor.
* Hanging from a shoulder strap, any four items, sets of items, or weapons each with an encumbrance of 1/6 st or less, excluding backpacks, harnesses, rucksacks, or sacks.
* Hanging from a waist belt, any four items or weapons each with an encumbrance of 1/6 st or less, excluding backpacks, harnesses, rucksacks, or large sacks.
* Hidden in any coat sleeve or boot, a tiny weapon.
* Stored in a backpack, up to 4 st of equipment or treasure.
* Stored in a belt pouch, up to 3/6 st of equipment or treasure.
* Stored in in a large sack, up to 6 st of equipment or treasure.
* Stored in a small sack or rucksack, up to 2 st of equipment or treasure.
* Worn on his head, one piece of headwear such as a helmet, visor, hat, or cap.
* Worn on his body, up to two pieces of jewelry in each location (neck, wrist, finger, etc.). Adventurers with Streetwise proficiency can pull off one additional piece of jewelry per rank without seeming garish. Note that some magic items (such as rings) cease to function if worn in excess.

It is our fervent hope that no player ever forces you to break out these rules. If, however, Steve of the Sixtyfold Sacks does appear in your campaign, you now are equipped to deal with it (pardon the pun).
