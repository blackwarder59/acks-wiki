## Step 3. Determine Inhabitants

The inhabitants of your settlement are, of course, more important than its architecture. Is the settlement ruled by a tribune, lord mayor, sheriff, prefect, or senate? How many divine casters staff the churches, shrines, and temples of the settlement? How many thieves ply the alleys and agoras in search of ill-gotten coin?

The **Starting Settlements** tables, below, can help you construct a starting settlement that is compatible with *ACKS.* For each class of settlement (I through VI) we have provided the suggested number of NPCs of each level for each of the six core classes. If your settlement is smaller or larger than the listed size, you can scale up or scale down the number of NPCs pro rata by population.

Since most *ACKS* campaigns feature a number of campaign and racial classes in addition to the core classes, you’ll need to decide which “special” classes count as which core classes. If you’re just using the classes found in the ***ACKS II Revised Rulebook****,* then barbarians, paladins, and dwarven vaultguards count as fighters; bladedancers, dwarven craftpriests, priestesses, shamans, and witches as crusaders; assassins, bards, and elven nightblades as thieves; and warlocks, elven spellswords, Nobiran wonderworkers, and Zaharan ruinguards count as mages.

At this step, you’re not actually generating or even naming these NPCs; you’re just determining their number by class and level. When you’re ready to start generating your NPCs, you can skip ahead to **Chapter 9: Non-Player Characters** (p. XX).

As always, do not feel confined to these exact parameters. While they represent average or expected values over an entire game world, any given settlement can and should stray from the average. If your campaign concept calls for a high-level mage ruling a small settlement, or a large settlement that’s been denuded of its NPCs, or for a settlement that is “the city of wizards” or “city of thieves,” adjust the numbers as you see fit.

Once you’ve decided on the numbers, create a roster with all of these values, either on paper or in a spreadsheet. You’ll use this roster to build your settlement’s points of interest.
