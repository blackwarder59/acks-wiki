## Strongholds and Followers

At particular milestones, all classes become eligible to build strongholds and attract followers. The exact nature of the stronghold and followers will depend on the choices made in allocating the custom class’s build points. The Custom Class Strongholds and Followers table below lists the available types of strongholds and the stronghold’s associated followers, along with the required build point allocation to qualify for them. The type of stronghold and followers must be selected when the custom class is created. A custom class can choose from any stronghold type and its associated followers it qualifies for. The name of the stronghold can be changed to match the name and theme of the custom class if desired.

| Hideout | 5,000gp | 2d6 1st level class members | Thievery Value 1+ |
| Dwarven Vault | 15,000gp | 3d6x10 1st level dwarven mercs | Dwarf Value 0+ |

EXAMPLE #1: The standard explorer has the values Hit Die 1, Fighting 2, Thievery 1, Divine 0, Arcane 0. The explorer qualified for both a Castle and a Hideout type stronghold. The class was envisioned as a settler-conquistador type, so we selected Castle for its stronghold type, which we renamed Border Fort. One could imagine an alternative explorer class that graduates to building a Hideout at 9th level, akin to Robin Hood’s merry band of archers and outlaws.

EXAMPLE #2: The standard assassinhas the values Hit Die 1, Fighting 2, Thievery 1, Divine 0, Arcane 0. The assassin qualified for either a Castle or Hideout type stronghold. The assassin class was envisioned as functioning secretly within society, so we selected Hideout for its stronghold type. We could imagine an alternative assassin class that graduates to building a Castle at 9th level, perhaps resembling the historical Hashishin’s desert compounds.

### Stronghold-Based Bonus Powers

A custom class that selects Fortified Church as its stronghold type pays only half the cost for its stronghold. This can be due to, e.g., divine intervention, or it can simply represent subsidy from a church or guild. Additionally, the followers associated with Fortified Churches are completely loyal (+4 Morale) and need not be paid.

A custom class that selects Castle as its stronghold type receives a bonus custom power at 5th level that increases the morale of his retainers and henchmen under certain circumstances. The custom power may be **battlefield prowess**, **chronicles of battle**, or **experience and hardiness**, or a similar custom power approved by you.

A custom class that selects Dwarven Vault or Elven Fastness receives the bonus powers, and consequent limitations, described in the **Dwarven Vaults** and **Elven Fastnesses** section of *ACKS Imperial Imprint.*
