## Abducting the Action

Abduction is what transforms random tables and wandering monsters into a living, breathing game world. Abduction is what transforms a hodge-podge of materials into a coherent campaign. You must study this art, and master it, the way Miyamato Musashi studied sword-fighting. But what is abduction?

Abduction is a special type of reasoning defined as “the process of arriving at an explanatory hypothesis of a surprising circumstance.” The foremost philosopher of abduction, Charles Sanders Peirce, summarized abduction as follows:

The surprising fact, C, is observed;

But if A were true, C would be a matter of course;

Hence, there is reason to suspect that A is true.

For instance, assume the surprising circumstance that your car won’t start this morning. If it were true that your car battery were dead, then the fact that your car wouldn’t start would be a matter of course. So there is reason to suspect (abduce) that your car battery is dead.

At its core, abduction is guesswork, but it forms the basis of all natural science, medical diagnosis, and indeed much of human thought. When Newton developed the laws of gravity based on observing the motion of falling bodies, he was using abductive reasoning. When a physician is presented with a set of symptoms and diagnoses an illness to explain the symptoms, he is using abductive reasoning.

Abduction is also the method used by conspiracy theorists worldwide when they observe surprising facts about our world and piece together sinister explanations for them. America has its share of conspiracy theorists, but it is in Italy that conspiracy theory has been refined to its finest art form. The Italians have coined the word *dietrologia* for the art of finding hidden motives to explain seemingly everyday events. As explained in the Guardian, “rampant suspicion is the reason Italians love the dinner game of dietrologia, in which participants try to out-trump each other with paranoid ideas...”

We have much to learn from the dietrologists, for abduction is the secret art of the greatest gamemasters. It is the art of finding explanations that make the campaign better.

### **Finding Explanations That Make the Campaign Better**

Near the end of our multi-year Auran Empire campaign, our party began exploring another world in their crystal sphere, filled with strange and alien beings. To fill up this new world, we began liberally adapting unused encounters and dungeons from other products and places. One such encounter, from a hastily-chosen free adventure we had downloaded, involved an ettin in a jail cell. Ettins are common enough in the Auran Empire from whence the adventurers hailed, but were not a creature that was native to the alien world they were now on.

Now, outside of the context of the game, the reason an ettin appeared is simply that we accidentally put him somewhere he shouldn’t have been. The encounter he was a part of had been created for a different dungeon in a different campaign, where his presence would not have been surprising. But on the alien world, his presence was odd indeed and demanded justification or removal. We could have simply changed the ettin into another creature more appropriate to the new world. But we didn’t — instead, we abduced why an ettin might be present.

So, the surprising fact: An ettin on an alien world.

Our abduction: If there were a mysterious gate through spacetime that swept up creatures from the Auran Empire and deposited them on the alien world, the presence of an ettin would be a matter of course.

Our conclusion: There is reason to suspect that a mysterious gate through spacetime exists on the alien world.

By simply importing a legacy encounter from an old dungeon we had lying around, we had suddenly concluded that a mysterious portal existed somewhere that brings in creatures from the old world to the new. If we had simply changed the ettin into an alien, this portal would not have existed, and the game world would have been a less interesting place.

Note that we did not start with the idea of the portal — we started with the arbitrary appearance of the creature. This is not cause-effect reasoning; it's the opposite. It's finding an explanation for something that didn't have one — an explanation that makes the campaign (hopefully) better.

### **Making Abduction Work For You**

The art of abduction depends on having a set of “surprising facts,” that is, a circumstance you need to explain. Fortunately, such facts are never in short supply. Indeed, the easiest and most accessible method of brainstorming available to any ***ACKS***Judge is random generation of facts. This ***Judges Journal***is filled with random tables in its later chapters. If those aren’t enough, you can find hundreds of game accessories online that can randomly generate content for you — random adventure generators, random magic swords, random taverns, random jewelry, random monsters, and on and on.

For example, with a single click on a random adventure generator, we once randomly created a dungeon called “The Weird Citadel of Secrets” with many rooms. One of these was Room 45, which noted “there are cracks in the floor here” and “treasure: 500sp, 20gp.” The surprising fact here is “there is treasure in an otherwise empty room with cracks in the floor.” We abduced that “if the treasure belonged to adventurers who had fallen into the cracks in the floor, this would make sense.” And, presto! The cracks in the floor became large, menacing cracks which must have broken under the feet of some hapless hero, whose precious wealth lingers there still. This is the oracular power of the dice at work!

Another great source of “surprising facts” is through adaptation — porting content from other sources into your campaign setting. For instance, in the Auran Empire, we’ve made use of old D&D modules such as Isle of Dread, Against the Giants, and City of the Gods, each of which came from a different campaign setting (Mystara, Greyhawk, and Blackmoor respectively). You can do the same with articles from Dragon and Dungeon magazine or various internet sources; modules from other game systems; ideas stolen from your favorite TV shows, movies, and books; or anything else you can take inspiration from! The ettin from earlier is a great example of this.

A third method of generating “surprising facts” is to rely on your players, who are endlessly dietrological. For instance, let’s imagine that your adventurers are on a wilderness expedition through a supposedly-dangerous forest. You haven’t prepped any particular content for this forest, and are relying on procedural generation to create encounters as they explore. Thus, as they move from hex to hex, you roll random encounter checks. But let’s say the checks keep failing — the party has no encounters! They begin to get suspicious. As the session draws to a close, one of the players says, “It’s altogether creepy that we haven’t encountered anythingin this forest. There must be some great evil here that brooks no rivals to its power.” The other group members nod, and the party leader says, “next session, we will find it and kill it.” Here the players have abduced the presence of a monster from the surprising lack of wandering monsters. Since you haven’t already fleshed this area out, you decide to run with this idea. For next session, you work up the lair of a powerful monster in a nearby hex.

In this case, abduction is akin to the quantum mechanics of a role-playing game world. Explanations for the facts of the game world may not exist until they are consciously observed; until then they are merely potential explanations, ideas floating in the seas of possibility. Abduction is how you plunge into the ocean of ideas and find the best ones to explain the facts you're dealing with in your game.

Abductive reasoning is so powerful and useful that a skilled Judge can use it to run entire adventures on the fly. All such masters need is a bunch of interesting and completely unconnected events and a bit of imagination. We encourage you to master the art of abduction — but we caution against letting it become your primary method of running your game. Used too often, it can create a solipsistic world where things become true only if and when the players think so. That is ultimately detrimental to the game, removing real choice from the players. For a Judge committed to the agency theory of fun, the best way of using abduction is to have it help explain what has happened, not change what will happen.
