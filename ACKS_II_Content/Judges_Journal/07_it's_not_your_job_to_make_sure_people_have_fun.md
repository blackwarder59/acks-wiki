## It's Not Your Job to Make Sure People Have Fun

If you spend much time reading or watching GM advice online, you’ll often be told that "the real job of the GM is to make sure people have fun."

But this is terrible advice. As an ***ACKS***Judge, it’s not your job to make sure everyone has fun. The belief that when a player doesn't have fun it means the GM has failed has caused more GMs more grief and heartburn than any other myth in gaming. You can be an amazing GM, yet a player might not have fun. Because whether or not people have fun is going to depend on factors that are outside your control: How did their spouse treat them on their way over? How was their day at work? How well do they roll the dice? Do they play the game as well as the other players? You can't control these things, and therefore you shouldn't feel responsible for them.

What you should feel responsible for doing is creating anenvironment in which everyone could have fun. Imagine that you are hosting a party: Your job is to provide the right mix of appetizers, drinks, ambiance, and crowd so that people can have fun. It's not to act like a clown because Rob had a bad day at work. This is a subtle point, but if you keep it in mind, you'll avoid a lot of self-inflicted doubt and stress about your role.
