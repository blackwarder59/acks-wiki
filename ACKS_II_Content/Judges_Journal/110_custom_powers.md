## Custom Powers

Custom powers are the special abilities that make classes unique. Custom powers may simply be class proficiencies or general proficiencies that are automatically assigned to every member of the class (such as the bard’s Performance proficiency) or they may be special abilities unique to the class.

By definition, custom powers are powers that are outside of the class powers of crusaders, fighters, mages, and thieves. For purposes of these rules, custom powers do *not* include (i) arcane or divine spellcasting, (ii) rebuking undead, (iii) fighter cleaving or weapon damage, or (iv) thief skills.

For instance, a character cannot trade in fighting skill or rebuking undead powers to get thief skills – thief skills can *only* be acquired by putting points into the Thievery Value. This is why the Ambushing, Climbing, and Eavesdropping proficiencies exist, as these powers might be selected by classes not otherwise interested in thievery.

### Custom Power Trade-Offs

In lieu of beginning with one or more custom powers, a custom class may instead select multiple powers that are “locked” until an advanced level of experience is earned. For example, a class might trade one custom power at 1st level in exchange for two custom powers, one unlocking at 4th level and 10th level.

The Custom Power Trade-Offs table below shows some possible options. You may devise other options along these lines as desired.

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Custom Power Trade-Offs** | | | |
| **Trade-Off** | **Benefit** | **Trade-Off** | **Benefit** |
| 1 initial power | 1 power at 2nd and 1 power at 12th level | 1 power at 8th level | 1 power at 10th and 1 power at 13th level |
| 1 initial power | 1 power at 3rd and 1 power at 11th level | 1 power at 8th level | 1 power at 9th and 1 power at 14th level |
| 1 initial power | 1 power at 4th and 1 power at 10th level | 1 power at 9th level | 1 power at 10th and 1 power at 14th level |
| 1 initial power | 1 power at 5th and 1 power at 9th level | 1 power at 9th level | 1 power at 11th and 1 power at 13th level |
| 1 initial power | 1 power at 6th and 1 power at 8th level | 1 power at 9th level | 2 powers at 12th level |
| 1 initial power | 2 powers at 7th level | 1 power at 10th level | 1 power at 11th and 1 power at 14th level |
| 2 initial powers | 1 power at 3rd, 5th, and 7th level | 1 power at 10th level | 1 power at 12th and 1 power at 13th level |
| 2 initial powers | 1 power at 2nd, 4th, and 9th level | 1 power at 11th level | 2 powers at 13th level |
| 2 initial powers | 3 powers at 5th level | 1 power at 11th level | 1 power at 12th and 1 power at 14th level |
| 1 power at 7th level | 1 power at 9th and 1 power at 13th level | 1 power at 12th level | 1 power at 13th and 1 power at 14th level |
| 1 power at 7th level | 1 power at 8th and 1 power at 14th level |  |  |

A custom class with thief skills *is* permitted to trade initial thief skill selections for multiple “locked” selections at a higher level. In this way, a class can be built that unlocks thief skills over time, or that mixes thief skills and custom powers.

EXAMPLE: A custom class has a Thievery Value of 2, giving it 8 skills. It trades two skill selections for skills at 2nd, 4th, and 9th level. It trades its third skill selection for skills at 3rd and 11th level. It trades its fourth skill selection for skills at 5th and 9th level. It trades its fifth skill selection for skills at 6th and 8th level. Finally, the class then trades one of the skills it will receive at 9th level for a skill at 10th level and 14th level. The class will get 3 thief skills at 1st level and an additional skill at 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th, and 14th level. It is possible to make very complex trade-offs, obviously!

When a thief skill or custom power is locked until a higher level of experience, the skill or power will unlock with its proficiency throw at class level.

### Custom Power Creation

You might wish to create new custom powers. Custom powers generally either (1) provide a bonus to one or more rolls or throws; (2) provide a specialized skill; or (3) enable the character to use a spell-like ability.

###### Bonuses to Rolls and Throws

Many custom powers provide bonuses to attack throws, initiative rolls, and so on. The guidelines below can be helpful in creating similar new powers.

**Armor Class:** A flat AC bonus of +1 in all circumstances counts as 1 custom power. If the power provides a bonus regardless of the armor the character is wearing, the bonus should never exceed +1. If the bonus is limited to leather armor or less, the bonus should begin at +1 but can increase to +2 at 7th level and +3 at 13th level. If the bonus requires a particular piece of equipment (such as a shield), it can provide a secondary benefit related to the equipment. For example, Fighting Style (weapon and shield) requires a shield, but has the secondary benefit of allowing the character to ready and sling his shield without using a combat action to do so.

**Attack Throws:** A flat +1 bonus to attack throws with either missile or melee weapons counts as 1 custom power. Attack throw bonuses can also be limited to a +1 bonus with either a specific group of weapons (e.g. Fighting Style) or against a specific category of opponents (e.g. Goblin-Slaying). If limited to a specific category of opponents, the bonus can increase with level (+2 at 7th level, +3 at 13th level). If limited to a specific group of weapons, the power can include a secondary benefit, such as free sheathing of the weapon. If the power carries substantial drawbacks, such as the inability to retreat from combat, a +2 bonus with a secondary benefit might be allowed (e.g. Berserkergang).

**Damage:** A flat damage bonus of +1 with all weapons counts as 1 custom power. It should have no secondary benefits. A power that offers a damage bonus of +1 with a specific group of weapons (e.g. Fighting Style) should offer a secondary benefit, such as free sheathing of the weapons. Characters can only gain damage bonuses that scale with level by selecting a Fighting Value 2 or higher; the Fighter Damage bonus (or something analogous to it) cannot be gained with trade-offs.

**Initiative:** A universal bonus of +1 to initiative counts as 1 custom power. If the power provides a bonus to initiative only in specific circumstances, it can have a secondary benefit. For instance, Battle Magic only provides an initiative bonus when casting spells, so it offers secondary benefits against spell resistance. An explorer’s Animal Reflexes does not provide an initiative bonus for spellcasting, so it offers a secondary benefit on surprise rolls. A bladedancer’s Initiative bonus applies in all circumstances, so it has no secondary benefits.

**Saving Throws:** A universal +2 bonus to all saving throws counts as 1 custom power. If a custom power offers only a +1 bonus to some or all saving throws, it should have some secondary benefits, such as elves’ Connection to Nature. A custom power that offers +3 or better to saving throws should only be used in rare circumstances, and should count as at least 2 custom powers. The Hardy People power possessed by dwarves, for instance, counts as 3 custom powers.

**Surprise:** A universal +2 bonus to surprise rolls counts as 1 custom power. A universal +1 bonus to surprise rolls is usually a secondary benefit to another class power, such as an explorer’s Animal Reflexes. A +1 bonus to surprise throws that is limited in circumstances and has no other special benefits, counts as 1/2 a custom power. Imposing a penalty of -2 to opponent’s surprise rolls counts as 1 custom power.

###### Specialized Skills

Some custom powers give characters specialized skills, such as Loremastery or Magical Engineering.

Powers that allow the character to attempt a specialized, but not particularly adventurous, task should have a fixed target value that does not change with character level. Making maps, crafting items, and similar tasks fall are examples. *ACKS* uses a default proficiency throw of 11+ for these tasks, with a +4 bonus for each additional proficiency or power allocated to the power. When a proficiency throw is set at 11+, a character has a 50% chance of succeeding at using it. This makes it very easy for the player and Judge to understand the implications of any bonuses or penalties on the roll. Moreover, these default values reward breadth across characters and depth of specialization within one character at approximately the same rate. That is, if two characters in the party take the same ability, the chance at least one succeeds will be 75%. If one character takes the same ability twice, the chance he succeeds will be 70%. Parties can have well-rounded or highly specialized characters, and both types of parties can succeed 70% of the time.

Powers that exclusively relate to adventuring, fighting, and casting spells should follow a per-level progression of target values, with initial target values ranging from 14+ to 20+, depending on the utility and risk of the power. The target value should then decrease with each level of experience earned, usually by 1 point per level. Class level is used even if the power is gained later in progression.

###### Spellcasting Abilities and Spell-Like Abilities

Several custom powers grant the class the ability to cast a spell at certain intervals or to use spells as spell-like abilities (e.g. cast them as combat actions). Should you wish to create other examples of similar custom powers, the following guidelines should be used:

**Level 1:** The power can be used at will with a casting time of 1 turn; once per hour with a casting time of 1 round; once per 8 hours as a spell-like ability; or at will but require stationary concentration for the duration.

**Level 2:** The spell can be used once per hour with a casting time of 1 turn; once per 8 hours with a casting time of 1 round; or once per day as a spell-like ability.

**Level 3:** The spell can be used once per 8 hours with a casting time of 1 turn; once per day with a casting time of 1 round; or once per week as a spell-like ability.

**Level 4:** The spell can be used once per day with a casting time of 1 turn; once per week with a casting time of 1 round; or once per month as a spell-like ability.

**Level 5:** The spell can be used once per week with a casting time of 1 turn or once per month with a casting time of 1 round.

**Level 6:** The spell can be used once per month with a casting time of 1 turn.

The caster level of spell-like abilities will always be either the minimum caster level or the class level, whichever is greater.

**Balancing Spell-Like Abilities**

When permitting spell-like abilities as class powers, you should always use careful discretion, as certain combinations of powers, or certain otherwise innocuous spells turned into class powers, can have unexpected results out of proportion to their normal game effect. For this reason, you must review spellcasting and spell-like abilities with the strictest scrutiny.

Blast, death, and enchantment effects should generally not be permitted as spellcasting or spell-like abilities at all. Spellcasting abilities and spell-like abilities other than detection should generally not appear as a class power at a level of experience lower than the spell’s level. For example, a class with the ability to *restore life and limb*once per month at 1st level should never be permitted. Classes with an XP progression faster than a crusader should never be assigned spell-like abilities with effects that scale with level.

### Custom Power Index

To assist GMs and players who wish to further exploit the custom class creation system, this section compiles a list of the exact custom powers used in building all of the classes in ***ACKS****,* ***ACKS II****,* ***By This Axe****,* ***Player’s Companion****,* ***Heroic Fantasy Handbook****,* ***Barbarian Conquerors of Kanahu****,* ***Secrets of the Nethercity****,* and ***AXIOMS****.* The classes which have the powers are noted in brackets. We’ve included powers from classes that aren’t in ***ACKS II*** so that you easily convert any of those classes to ***ACKS II***mechanics – the work has been done for you. Some of the custom powers rely on game mechanics found in their sourcebook, and players and Judges should refer to those books for further details.

When used in the powers below, “the character” refers to any member of the class. This document is intended to be comprehensive but in order to remain manageable in size, it does exclude some custom powers:

* We haven’t listed the thief skills, as they cannot be selected via trade-offs as custom powers.
* We have generally excluded custom powers that grant spell-like abilities following the standard schedule of usage described under Spell-Like Abilities (p. XX). Occasionally where the same spell-like ability shows up repeatedly in several classes, we have listed it for easy reference, as with the warlock’s various spell-like abilities that are shared with the occultist.
* We have generally not listed below those custom powers which simply assign the character a bonus proficiency. However, we have listed those custom powers which are identical to a proficiency mechanically but in the game world are separate abilities that can be stacked with the proficiency in particular ways or have important variations. For instance, the Secrets of the Dark Arts custom power is mechanically identical to the Black Lore of Zahar proficiency, but since Secrets of the Dark Arts can be stacked on top of Black Lore, it has been included in the list. We have also listed those custom powers where the proficiency itself has changed in ***ACKS II****.*
* Monstrous special abilities that are possessed by monstrous character classes. Monstrous special abilities are only available to GM-made racial custom classes or leveled monsters. The XP cost for such characters should be determined based on the rules in ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual****.*

Some custom powers below are so limited in scope that they only count as 1/2 a power. Others are so useful as to count as 1 1/2 , 2, or even more custom powers if selected. This is noted in italics.

**Abominable Mutation:** The character’s self-experimentation has turned him into something both more and less than human. The character gains an abominable mutation, choosing from either *beast eyes, claw-like nails, scaly skin,* or *tentacles*. Beast eyes grant *lightless vision* with a range of 60’ but impose a -2 penalty to reaction rolls. Claw-like nails grant two attacks per round dealing 1d4-1 points of damage, but impose a -2 penalty to reaction rolls and a -2 penalty on proficiency throws requiring delicate work. Scaly skin grants a +2 AC, but reduces maximum movement rate by 25% and imposes a -4 penalty on reaction rolls. Tentacles allow the character to hold torches or other objects while keeping his hands free and grant two attacks per round dealing 1d3-1 points of damage, but impose a -2 penalty to reaction rolls. Judges who own ***AX1: The Sinister Stone of Sakkara*** can allow the character to select other Abominable Mutations from that book if desired. [Elven Wizard, Zaharan Sorcerer]

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Market Class** | **Max Capital / Month** |
| I | 100,000gp\* |
| II | 25,000gp |
| III | 10,000gp |
| IV | 5,000gp |
| V | 2,000gp |
| VI | 1,000gp |
| \*Per 20,000 families | |

**Access to Capital:** The character can borrow money from the merchant guild at an interest rate of 3% per month without collateral or at an interest rate of 1% per month with collateral. There is no limit to how much he can borrow in total, but each market only has a limited pool of capital for use each month, shown on the adjoining table. If the character fails to pay interest each month, he becomes disreputable in that market. While disreputable, he cannot use his mercantile network or friendly merchant connections. If the venturer allows interest payments to build up such that he owes more in gp than his total XP, then his former business partners will begin to send rival adventurers after him, with wages by level that total the monthly interest payment. A henchman will not use this ability on behalf of his employer, but a player character can do so on behalf of his fellow party members. To select this custom power, a class must have the **mercantile network** power. [Venturer II]

**Accuracy:** The character gains an accuracy bonus of +1 to all attack throws with missile weapons. [Elven Ranger]

**Acrobatics**: The character is trained to jump, tumble, somersault, and free-run around obstacles. He gains a +2 to saving throws where agility would help avoid the danger, such as tilting floors and pit traps. He can add his class level to his DEX for purposes of the distance and height he can jump (p. XX). In lieu of moving during a round, he can attempt a proficiency throw to tumble past an opponent in melee. At 1st level the character must make a proficiency throw of 18+ to succeed. The proficiency throw required reduces by 1 per level. If the throw fails, the character remains stationary. If it succeeds, he tumbles directly past his enemy, ending up either facing towards or away from him (player’s choice). If he ends up facing away, he can complete a combat movement in lieu of attacking if desired. If he ends up facing towards the opponent, he can attack the opponent from the rear. If he has Backstabbing class power, he can backstab the opponent. Characters wearing medium or heavy armor or with an encumbrance of more than 5 stone cannot tumble. [Beastmaster, Cultist of Atlach-Nacha, Elven Nightblade, Fool]

**Adhesive Toe Pads:** The character can climb on most walls or other vertical surfaces at 1/2 speed without need for a proficiency throw. He can climb on any sheer surface (such as glass) or walk on ceilings at 1/4 speed by succeeding on a proficiency throw to climb walls as a thief of his level. *This custom power counts as 2 powers*. [Geckoman]

**After the Flesh:** The character grows in power if he becomes undead. For a full a description of this power, see the Zaharan Custom Classes section above. *This power counts as 1 power when selected by a human custom class; but if the Judge creates a new race to which he assigns this power, it should count as 3 powers.* [Anti-Paladin, Sorcerer, Zaharans]

**Ageless:** See **longeval**.

**Alertness:** The character gains a +1 bonus to avoid surprise. When using Adventuring proficiency to search or listen, he succeeds on a proficiency throw of 14+ (instead of the usual 18+). If separately proficient in Searching or Listening, he gain a +2 bonus to his throw instead. This is effectively the Alertness proficiency selected as a custom power. For flavor, mystics and veildancers call this power **mindfulness,** Nephilim call it **alien senses**,and bugmen call it **keen insect senses**. [Bugmen, Mystic, Nephilim, Nobiran Veildancer]

**Alien Beings:** See **inhumanity**.

**Alien Intuition:** The character can achieve on-the-spot understanding of alien technology on a proficiency throw of 11+, and only suffers mishaps on an unmodified roll of 1. The character gains a +1 bonus on all research throws related to alien technology. *This custom power counts as 2 powers.* [Nephilim]

**Alien Lore:** The character can achieve on-the-spot understanding of alien weapons, armor, and chemicals on a proficiency throw of 7+, and only suffer mishaps on an unmodified roll of 1 in those categories. *This custom power counts as 3 powers.* [Nephilim]

**Alien Senses:** See **alertness**.

**Alluring Beauty:** See **glamorous aura**.

**Ambushing:** When the character attacks with surprise using melee weapons or using missile weapons at short range, he gets a +4 bonus on his attack throws and deals an extra die of damage on the attack. This is effectively the Ambushing proficiency, selecting as a custom power. [Cultist of Atlach-Nacha, Explorer, Gnomish Trickster]

**Analyze Data**: The character can analyze datato help determine the most favorable course of action. Analyzing data requires one turn (10 minutes) and the character must have access to a multiscanner. Analyzing data will provide the character with useful information regarding a question concerning a specific goal, event, or activity that is to occur within one week. The future is ever-changing, so if the character does not act on the information, it will quickly become useless. To successfully analyze data the character must make a proficiency throw of 8+. The proficiency throw is reduced by to 7+ at 9th level and 6+ at 12th level. Since over-analysis is never fruitful, the character can analyze data no more than once per day. [Terran Starman]

A**ncient Pacts:** The character gains a +1 bonus to reaction rolls when encountering intelligent chaotic monsters. Intelligent chaotic monsters suffer a -2 penalty to saving throws against any enchantment spells cast by the character. For flavor, cultist of Nabu call this power **horrible truths** while elven cultists of Iskara call it **chthonic hegemon**.[Cultist of Nabu, Elven Cultist, Zaharans]

**Animal Companion:** See **totem animal**.

**Animal Friendship:** Whenever the character builds a fastness, all ordinary animals within 3 miles of the stronghold become kind and helpful. Beastmasters call this power **fellowship of animals** while wizards call it **steward of the wild**. *This custom power only counts as 1/2 a power if selected.* [Beastmaster, Elven Courtier, Elven Ranger, Elven Spellsword, Elven Spellsinger, Elven Warlord, Elven Wizard, Nobiran Wizard, Wizard]

**Animal Magnetism:** See **battlefield prowess**.

**Animal Reflexes:** The character gains a +1 bonus on to initiative rolls and a +1 bonus to avoid surprise. This does not provide a bonus to casting spells. While Animal Reflexes is similar to taking the Combat Reflexes proficiency selected as a custom power, for game balance reasons, consider Animal Reflexes as a separate custom power and allow it to stack with Combat Reflexes. For flavor, mystics call this power **speed of thought**, halfling bounders call it **nervous watchfulness**,and Zaharan ruinguards call it **quickening**. [Barbarian, Beastmaster, Explorer, Elven Ranger, Halfling Bounder, Mystic, Zaharan Ruinguard]

**Antennae for Potions:** The character may make a proficiency throw of 11+ to determine the magical properties of a potion or oil based on its scent and emanations. A reduced-cost variant of **nose for potions**. [Bugman Ovate]

**Arcane Dabbling:** The character can attempt to use wands, staffs, and other magic items only useable by mages. The character does not need to know the command word for the item, but he must make a proficiency throw of 4+ or the attempt backfires with potentially disastrous consequences. This is effectively the Arcane Dabbling proficiency selected as a custom power. [Bard, Cultist of Nabu]

**Arcane Striking:** When the character successfully strikes a target with a melee attack, he can expend one of his daily spell slots to increase damage. Damage is increased by 1d6 per level of the spell slot expended. Damage dealt by arcane striking counts as extraordinary damage. If the target is slain by his arcane strike, the character is eligible to cleave as if he had slain the target in melee*. This custom power counts as 1 power at Arcane Value 1-2 and 2 powers at Arcane Value 3-4.* [Zaharan Ruinguard]

**Arena Reputation:** See **battlefield prowess**.

**Armor Training:** The character gains proficiency in armor one weight category heavier than normally permitted by his class without penalty. Armor Training does not grant the character the ability to use thief skills in medium or heavy armor, nor to benefit from proficiencies or class powers that require light, very light, or no armor. This is effectively the Armor Training proficiency selected as a class power. [Chosen, Elven Warlord, Nobiran Champion]

**Artificial Youth:** See **longeval.**

**Attunement to Nature:** The character gains a +1 bonus to surprise rolls when in the wilderness.When using the Adventuring proficiency to search or listen, they succeed on a proficiency throw of 14+ (instead of the usual 18+). If separately proficient in Searching they gain a +2 bonus to their throw instead. If separately proficient in Listening, they gain a +4 bonus to their throw instead. *This custom power counts as 1 1/2 powers if selected.* [Elves, Nobiran Wizard, Wizard]

**Avoid Getting Lost:** See **pathfinding**.

**Awareness of the Earth:** By spending one turn (10 minutes) visually examining an area of up to 10,000 square feet, and making a successful proficiency throw of 11+, the character can detect dangerous sinkholes, deadfalls, collapses, or rock slides. He can attempt to assess the land value of a hex to determine if it is worth settling. Finally, the character can attempt to assess the total number of lairs in the hex based on the lay of the land, evidence of cultivation, and other factors. This is effectively the Land Surveying proficiency, selected as a custom power. [Elven Cultist of Telith]

**Aura of Protection:** The character has a +1 bonus to AC and a +1 bonus on saving throws against attacks made or effects created by evil (or, alternatively, good) creatures. The character’s aura of protection appears as a golden halo (or, alternatively, a tenebrous shroud) when viewed with *discern good*, *discern magic*, or *true seeing*. [Anti-Paladin, Nobiran Wizard, Paladin, Wizard]

**Baleful Transformation:** The character can, through an unholy ritual of sacrifice to the Chaotic gods Dagon and Rahab, transform into a deep one. If and when they complete their transformation into full deep ones, the character retains his class abilities and may continue to level and grow in HD and in power. The character can then continue play as a deep one. [Deep One Hybrid]

**Ballistics Expertise:** The character attacks as a fighter of his class level when crewing ballista, catapults, trebuchets, or ranged automaton weapons. He deals +1 damage at 1st level with ballista, catapults, or ranged automaton weapons, and an additional +1 at 3rd, 6th, and 9th level. *This custom power counts as 3 powers if selected.* [Dwarven Machinist]

**Battle Magic:** The character gains a +1 initiative bonus when casting spells. When casting spells that require an attack throw, his attack throw is determined using the fighter progression. (If the character already uses the fighter progression, he gains a further +1 to hit.) This is effectively the Battle Magic proficiency, selected as a custom power. [Elven Cultist of Bel]

**Battlefield Prowess:** Any henchmen and mercenaries hired by the character gain a +1 bonus to their morale score whenever he personally leads them. For flavor, barbarians, beastmasters, and berserkers call this **animal magnetism**, dragons incarnate call it **greatness of soul**, dwarven pugilists call it **eye of the tige**r, lizardman gladiators call it **arena reputation**,runemakers call it **widespread renown**, and warmistresses call it **fiery spirit**. [Barbarian, Beastmaster, Berserker, Dragon Incarnate, Elven Warlord, Fighter, Lizardman Gladiator, Nobiran Champion, Runemaker, Thrassian Deathchanter, Thrassian Gladiator, Warlord]

**Battle Plan:** See **inspire courage**.

**Bedazzling Glamour**: The character has learned how to use magical glamour to conceal imperfections. While active, the glamour grants three benefits:

* The character gains a +1 bonus to all reaction rolls. This bonus does not stack with Mystic Aura (though other effects do).
* The character does not suffer any age-related penalty to CHA.
* Permanent wounds or side effects that otherwise would cause a penalty to reaction rolls are ignored.

Activating the glamour demands one turn (10 minutes) of concentration by the character. Once activated, the glamour remains active until the character ends it, is subject to a **dispel** effect, or is incapacitated. While the glamour is active, the character radiates magic. [Chthonic Witch]

**Berserkergang, Greater:** The character can enter a killing rage.The character can enter a greater berserkergangonce per day. (A character who selects ranks of the Berserkergang proficiency increases the number of times per day he can enter greater berserkergang by one per rank.) Entering a greater berserkergang requires a full-round action, during which time the character works himself into a frenzy, biting on his shield, foaming at the mouth, and howling like a wild animal. While in a greater berserkergang, the character gains a +2 bonus to attack throws and damage rolls and becomes immune to fear. Additionally, the character decreases the damage from any non-magical attacks by 1 point per die. (Damage can be reduced to 0, but not less than 0, on each die. Attacks from monsters of 5 HD or more are considered magical attacks due to the monster’s ferocity.)

This protection increases to 2 points per die at 7th level and 3 points per die at 13th level. However, a character in a state of greater berserkergang becomes limited in his tactics (as per the Berserkergang proficiency) and has trouble distinguishing friend from foe. If a character in a greater berserkergang rolls a natural 1 on an attack throw, he automatically hits a nearby ally within 5’ in lieu of his preferred target. Once begun, a greater berserkergang cannot be ended until combat ends. When the greater berserkergang ends, the character is immediately **fatigued** and **winded** until he rests for 1 turn (10 minutes). This power can only be selected by a class that takes Lesser Berserkergang as a class power. [Berserker]

**Berserkergang, Lesser:** The character can enter a killing rage. While enraged, he gains a +2 bonus to attack throws and becomes immune to fear. However, the character has a -2 penalty to AC and becomes limited in his tactics. He cannot conduct defensive movement to retreat or withdraw from an enemy within 5’ and cannot move in such a way that the range between himself and the nearest visible threat would increase. He must advance 5’ after cleaving if necessary to do so to engage an enemy and he has sufficient movement. Once it has begun, a berserker rage cannot be ended until combat ends. This is effectively the Berserkergang proficiency, selected as a custom power. For flavor, bugmen praetors call this power **killing spree** and cultists of Qetesh call it **bestial fury**. [Berserker, Bugman Praetor, Cultist of Qetesh]

**Bestial Cry:** Once per day, the character can shout a bestial crythat can be heard up to 750’ away. Hostile ordinary animals hearing the cry must immediately make a morale roll. Other ordinary animals hearing the cry may come to his assistance. If the animal is friendly to the character (e.g. if it is a henchman, a trained animal, or resident within 3 miles of his encampment) it will automatically run or fly to his assistance as quickly as possible. Otherwise, you should make a reaction roll for each animal, with a Friendly result indicating the creature comes to the character’s assistance. [Beastmaster]

**Bestial Fury:** See **berserkergang, lesser**.

**Blade-Dancing:** The character gains a +1 bonus to Armor Class if wearing light, very light, or no armor, and carrying 5 stones or less encumbrance. At level 7, the AC bonus increases to +2, and at level 13 the AC bonus increases to +3. For flavor, mystics and warmistresses call this power **graceful fighting**, mog brutes call it **pugilism**, and pugilists (just to be confusing) call it **legwork**. While Blade-Dancing is similar to taking the Swashbuckling proficiency selected as a custom power, for game balance reasons, consider Blade-Dancing as a separate custom power and allow it to stack with Swashbuckling as noted in that proficiency. [Bladedancer, Mystic, Nobiran Veildancer, Pugilist, Warmistress]

**Blessing of the Dead:** See **divine health**.

**Blindsight:** The character can see to a range of 60’, regardless of light sources, magical darkness, or other visual phenomena. However, blindsight is useless in Windy conditions. *Blindsight counts as 2 1/2 custom powers.* [Bugmen]

**Blood of Kings:** The blood of ancient kings and heroes flows in the character. The character may hire one more henchman than his Charisma would otherwise permit, and the base loyalty score of any henchmen is increased by 1. Chosen call this power **scion of kings** while dragon incarnate call it **soul of the dragon**. [Chosen, Dragon Incarnate, Nobirans]

**Bloody Healing:** The character does not heal naturally. Instead, it can only heal by magical means, or by consuming the flesh or blood of living or recently-dead sentient beings. The character can recover 1d6 hit points by eating the flesh of a recently slain sapient creature of at least 1 HD. Alternatively, it can drink the blood of a living creature, causing 1d4 points of damage per round and restoring that amount to its own hit points, up to a maximum of half the target's hit points. [Revenant]

**Bone-Breaking Strength:** The character does 1d6-2 points of damage with his unarmed attacks, and can make two attacks per round when unarmed. When the character reaches 5th level, his natural attacks deal extraordinary damage. *This custom power counts as 2 powers if selected.* [Mog Brute]

**Bonus Languages:** The character begins play speaking four bonus languages. Venturers call this power **multilingual**.[Dwarves, Elves, Gnomes, Halflings, Katripol, Zaharans, Nobiran Champion, Nobiran Veildancer, Venturer II]

**Boon Companion:**Whenever an ally within 30’ makes an attack throw, proficiency throw, or saving throw, the character may spend a Fate Point to allow the ally to re-roll the throw. The character can spend additional Fate Points to allow further re-rolls if desired. However, the ally can never re-roll a natural 1. [Chosen]

**Brewing Quacksalves:** The character can brew quacksalves as a mountebank (see ***AXIOMS*** *5*). [Mountebank]

**Bribery**: The character gains a +1 bonus to reaction rolls if he offers one day’s pay for the target; a +2 bonus for a week’s pay; and a +3 bonus for a month’s pay. His bribery is so subtle that the attempt is politely deniable by both parties. The character is only blatant enough to be charged with the crime of bribery if he rolls an unmodified 2 on 2d6.. This is effectively the Bribery proficiency, selected as a custom power. [Cultist of Moloch, Venturer, Venturer II]

**Bright Lore:** The character can rebuke undead as a crusader of one half his class level (rounded up). If the character casts spells that require a Paralysis saving throw, his targets suffer a -2 penalty on the save. When the character casts protection spells (including dispels), the spell effects are calculated as if he were two caster levels higher than his actual caster level. His eligibility to research protection magic is determined as if he were two caster levels higher than actual. He gains a +2 bonus on magic research throws and increases his research rate by 10% when researching protection magic. While this is effectively Bright Lore of Aura proficiency selected as a custom power, consider Bright Lore as a separate custom power and allow it to stack with the proficiency, such that the character can rebuke undead as a crusader of two-thirds his class level (rounded up), and his protection spells and research are calculated as if he were three (rather than two) caster levels higher than his actual caster level. [Nobiran Wizard, Wizard]

**Broad Spectrum Inoculations:** See **divine health**.

**Brutality:** When unarmed, the character can perform the Wrestling, Knock Down, and Sunder special maneuvers at no attack penalty, representing his great might and brutality in hand-to-hand combat. *This custom power counts as 3 powers if selected.* [Mog Brute]

**Cast the Runes:** The character spends one round casting the runes and then receive an **augury** (as the spell) about what fate has in store. The character must have access to runic implements in order to cast the runes, and he can do so only once every 8 hours. (Note that “casting” in this context is analogous to the casting of dice, not the casting of spells). [Runemaker]

**Ceremonial Magic:** The character has learned the ceremonies of a particular tradition of ceremonial magic (antiquarian, liturgical, runic, sylvan, shamanic, or theurgical). The character must choose the tradition at the time he chooses the custom power. When this custom power is selected, the character becomes a 1st level ceremonialist with a repertoire of one 1st level ceremony. He can perform ceremonies in the tradition and create and use trinkets and talismans in the tradition as a 1st level ceremonialist, and can identify trinkets or talismans created by a ceremonialist of the tradition with a proficiency throw of 11+ and of other traditions with an 18+. This custom power can be selected multiple times. Each subsequent time it is selected, the character can either reduce the proficiency throw required to identify trinkets and talismans of a tradition he already knows by 4; learn another tradition; add one ceremony (of any level he can perform) to his repertoire; or increase his ceremonialist caster level by two, up to a maximum of his class level. Spells learned from other custom powers (such as Eldritch Talent) are not included in the character’s repertoire of ceremonies. [Chosen, Zaharan Sorcerer]

**Charismatic Ferocity:** When attacking with tiny, small, or medium weapons, the character can apply his CHA modifier instead of his STR modifier to his damage rolls. [Warmistress]

**Child-Like:** See **inhumanity**.

**Chitinous Carapace:** See **scaly hide**.

**Chosen Weapon:**The character can designate a particular individual weapon as his chosen weapon. The chosen weapon must be given a name (e.g. “Excalibur” or “Anduril”). When the character wields his chosen weapon, it is treated as if its magical bonus to attack and damage were 1 point greater. This custom power can be selected multiple times, but no more than once at 1st to 4th level, twice at 5th to 9th level, and thrice at 10th level and above. Each time it is selected the character can increase the bonus of his chosen weapon or designate an additional weapon as a chosen weapon. [Chosen]

**Chronicles of Battle:** Any henchmen and mercenaries hired by the character gain a +1 bonus to their morale score if the character is there to witness and record their deeds. [Bard]

**Chthonic Hegemon:** See **ancient pacts**.

**Clarion Commander:** When the character issues a call to arms to his vassals, he can ask them to muster their full garrison without provoking a Henchman Morale roll. When the character levies the peasant militia of his domain, or when his vassals levy their militias in response to his call to arms, morale of the domain does not suffer a penalty. All militia levied by the herald, or by his vassals in response to the character’s call to arms, gain a +1 bonus to their morale scores, for the duration of the call. (This bonus does not stack if both the ruler and a vassal have this power.) [Nobiran Champion]

**Classical Weapons Training:** See **martial talent**.

**Claws and Bite:** The character gains a claw/claw/bite attack routine. When the character reaches 5th level, his natural attacks count as silver weapons. When the character reaches 9th level, his natural attacks deal extraordinary damage. *This custom power counts as 2 or more custom powers if selected, depending on the damage of the claws and bite*. [Cultist of Bokrug, Thrassian Gladiator]

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Cost** | **Claw Damage** | **Bite Damage** |
| 2 powers | 1d2-1 | 1d4-1 |
| 3 powers | 1d3-1 | 1d6-1 |
| 4 powers | 1d3-1 | 1d8-1 |
| 5 powers | 1d4-1 | 1d8-1 |
| 6 powers | 1d4-1 | 1d10-1 |

**Cleansing Touch:**By touching a creature and spending a Fate Point, the character can instantly remove a curse or dispel a harmful magical effect. The character must be of equal or greater level than the spellcaster who cast the curse or effect. [Chosen]

**Close Friend of Birds and Beasts:** The character can *speak with beasts* (as the spell) at will. If, while speaking with small, cute animals such as songbirds, squirrels, and rabbits, the character ever rolls Friendly reactions, the animals act as if *bewitched* in his presence. A class must have Beast Friendship or an equivalent class power before adding this class power. [Sylvan Witch]

**Comfort and Console the Wounded**: The character can help the faithful to better endure pain and suffering while they heal. Each use of the ability requires 1 turn (10 minutes), during which the target creature is reassured through prayer and pastoral guidance. Once comforted and consoled, the creature’s base healing rate from resting is doubled for the next day. A character cannot comfort and console wounded creatures of a different alignment or religion, nor can he comfort and console creatures of animal intelligence. This ability only applies to healing from resting. It does not stack with the effects of the *salving rest*spell nor with rallying the faithful. [Ecclesiastic]

**Command of Voice:** The character gains a +1 bonus to reaction rolls with creatures he speaks to. If this bonus results in a total of 12 or more, the subjects act as if *bewitched* while in his presence. Creatures with a WIL greater than the character’s CHA are immune to this power (and the character will know they are immune). This power is a slightly modified version of the Mystic Aura proficiency. For flavor, dragon incarnates call this power **majesty of the dragon.** See also **glamorous aura**. [Dragon Incarnate, Mystic, Nobiran Veildancer]

**Command Undead:** The character can command undead as a Chaotic crusader of half his level. [Anti-Paladin]

**Commune with Ancestral Spirits:** The character can commune with spirits. He can choose between the ancestral spirits of his tribe, or the natural spirits of his current location. The spirits will answer three yes-or-no questions to the best of their ability. They are very wise regarding their tribal history or local area, but not omniscient, so they might not be able to answer some questions accurately. Such details are left to your discretion. The ritual to commune with the ancestor spirits takes 1 turn to complete, during which time the shaman is “out of body” and entirely helpless. The ritual is so taxing that it can be performed but once per week. Once a year, on a particular sacred day (determined by you, the Judge), the shaman can ask twice the normal number of questions of his ancestors without angering them. Communing with the spirits in a sinkhole of evil is a dangerous and chaotic act that might violate his code of behavior or put him at risk of haunting or possession (Judge’s discretion). [Geckoman Spirit-Talker, Shaman]

**Compel Submission:** Once per hour, the character can cast *word of command* (as the 1st level divine spell) with a casting time of 1 round. Creatures charmed with **glamorous aura** or related powers suffer a -4 penalty on saving throws against this effect. [Priestess of Nasga]

**Concealed from Undead:** The character is always considered to be in dim light or cover for purposes of hiding from undead. When the character sneaks, the range at which undead can see him with lightless vision is halved. [Blessed Undertaker]

**Conduit to the Esoteric:** This power can only be selected by a character who gains a familiar as a custom power. Select two 1st and one 2nd level black magic spell of each level that the character has not yet added to his repertoire. When the familiar is within 30’ of the character, he can treat those spells as if they were in his repertoire. (If the character later adds those spells to his actual repertoire, the familiar can become a conduit to new spells instead.) [Zaharan Sorcerer]

**Conjure Dark Powers (1st level):** When the character casts summoning spells (such as*conjure fiend*or *summon**shadows*), the spell effects are calculated as if he were two caster levels higher than his actual level of experience. (This makes them harder to dispel.) If the character loses his concentration due to taking damage while controlling a conjured creature, he must make a Spell saving throw. If the save succeeds, he maintains his concentration. His eligibility to conduct research on summoning magic is determined as if he were two caster levels higher than actual. He gains a +2 bonus on magic research throws and increases his research rate by 10% when researching summoning magic. Conjure Dark powers can stack with the Mastery of Conjuration and Summoning proficiency, such that the character’s summoning spells are calculated as if he were three (rather than two) caster levels higher and he gains a +2 bonus on his Spells save to maintain concentration. [Warlock]

**Connection to Nature:** The character is unaffected by diseases caused by undead, gains a +1 bonus on HD rolls at 1st level, and gain a +1 bonus on Paralysis and Spells saving throws. For flavor, revenants call this **relentless**.[Elves, Revenant]

**Consume Souls:** Once per month the character may cast *soul eating* (as the 6th level spell) with a casting time of 1 turn (10 minutes). Creatures *bewitched* with the character’s special abilities suffer a -4 penalty on saving throws against this effect. [Priestess of Nasga]

**Contact Dark Powers:** The character can cast *contact other sphere*once per week. It takes 1 turn (10 minutes) to cast. This is effectively the Soothsaying proficiency, selected as a custom power. [Geckoman Warlock, Occultist, Sorcerer, Warlock]

**Courage:**See **strength of spirit.**

**Create Advanced Technology:** The character can create advanced technological items similar in power to Visitor technology as if they were magical items. Technological items of a non-consumable nature will require energy crystals as a special component, while consumable technological items will require energy crystals to power them. [Terran Engineer]

**Cunning and Flexible Reconnoiter**: The character excels in scouting and screening the enemy. Whenever the character is commander of the scouting or screening units in an army, or its overall leader, the army treats any opposing army as if it were one row more proximate on the Results of Reconnaissance Rolls table. If the opposing army is already in the same 6-mile hex, then the army treats its degree of success as one column better instead. Any opposing army treats the character’s army as if it were one row less proximate for reconnaissance results, or if already at maximum distance, as if its degree of success were one column worse. [Nobiran Champion]

**Curse with Ill Fate:** Once per day, the character can curse an enemy with ill fate, either by chanting the curse or activating a curse-pole, as per a runemaker. [Runemaker]

**Daredevil:** See **strength of spirit**.

**Dark Blessing:** See **divine blessing**.

**Dark Charisma:** Any chaotic characters or monsters in the character’s service gain a +1 bonus to their morale score whenever he personally leads them. [Zaharan Ruinguard]

**Deadly Additive:** The character can create deadly additives such as venoms and toxins. Creating a deadly additive requires the ability to perform ceremonies. Creating a deadly additive requires one turn and the use of the character’s traditional implements, and causes the character to gain 1 stigma. The additive can be applied to a weapon or ingested. If applied to a weapon, the weapon deals additional damage on its next successful attack within one hour. If ingested, the creature that ingested it takes damage immediately. The additive will magically resist dilution, and only a single creature can be harmed by ingesting it. In either case, the damage dealt is equal to 1d6 per level of the highest-level ceremony the character can cast, with no saving throw permitted. If not applied or ingested, the additive will retain its potency until the alchemist recovers stigma. A character can have only one deadly additive crafted at a time. [Gnomish Alchemist]

**Death-Dealing Dance:** While performing a death-dealing dance, the character is a whirlwind of flashing blades and swirling garb, gaining one bonus melee or thrown attack each round and dealing 1d6 bonus damage with every successful melee or thrown attack (including cleaves). Entering a death-dealing dance requires a full-round action during which time the character begins the ritual steps of the dance. Once begun, a death-dealing dance continues until either all visible enemies are slain, the character is incapacitated, the character chooses to end the dance, or 1 turn elapses, whichever comes first. A character can perform a death-dealing dance once per day. [Warmistress]

**Death Healing:** When the character successfully slays a sentient creature with a melee attack, he can expend a spell slot to heal himself. Healing is 1d6 per level of the spell slot expended, to a maximum value equal to the slain victim's maximum (starting) hit points. The character can cleave after death healing if he has any cleaves remaining. *This custom power counts as 1 power with Arcane Value 1-2 and 2 powers with Arcane Value 3-4.* [Zaharan Ruinguard]

**Deathly Visage:** The character suffers a -2 on reaction rolls vs. any non-Chaotic beings and enjoys +2 to reaction rolls with Chaotic beings. *This custom power counts as 0 custom powers if selected.* [Revenant]

**Deciphering:** The character gains the ability to decipher tex**t**(including ciphers, treasure maps, and dead languages, but not magical writings). Deciphering a page of text requires one turn (10 minutes) and a successful proficiency throw of 4+ on 1d20. If the roll does not succeed, the character cannot try to decipher that particular page of text until he reaches a higher level of experience. [Bard, Loremaster, Mountebank, Nobiran Wizard, Venturer, Wizard]

**Demand Surrender:** As an action in lieu of moving or attacking, the character can demand surrender from a group of hostile creatures. The group can be of any size, but the creatures must be able to see, hear, and understand the character, and must be either outnumbered or surprised by the character and his allies in order to be affected. Affected creatures must make an immediate morale roll with a penalty equal to the character’s CHA bonus. A result of Retreat will lead to their immediate surrender. If the demand fails, a character cannot demand surrender from the same creature or creatures again until other circumstances have triggered a morale roll by the creature or creatures. This ability can be used at the start of a large-scale battle if the opposing army is surprised or outnumbered by the character’s army. [Nobiran Champion]

**Demi-Human Ancestry:** The character gains a +1 bonus on Paralysis and Spells saving throws. *This custom power counts as 1/2 custom power if selected.* [Halflings]

**Design, Build, and Repair Automatons:** The character can design, build, and repair automatons, following the procedures detailed in the dwarven machinist class. Terran engineers refer to this as **design, build, and repair ingenious devices**.*This custom power counts as 3 powers if selected.* [Dwarven Machinist, Terran Engineer]

**Design, Build, and Repair Ingenious Devices:** See **design, build, and repair automatons**.

**Destined:**The character gains two Fate Points. This custom power may be selected multiple times. [Chosen]

**Detachable Tail:** The character has a detachable regenerating tail. If the character is dealt a mortal wound, he can sacrifice his tail. Sacrificing the tail grants a +20 bonus on the character’s subsequent roll on the Mortal Wounds table. However, his tail is important to the character’s health and balance, and as long as he is tail-less, he suffers a -2 penalty to his Dexterity and Constitution scores. Regeneration of the character’s tail takes 2d3 months. [Geckomen]

**Detect Good:** See **discern good.**

**Detect Evil:** See **discern evil.**

**Detect Traps:** This power, which offered a partial version of a thief’s searching abilities, has been removed from ***ACKS II****.* In lieu of this power, the dwarven power **sensitivity to rock and stone** has been made more powerful. [Dwarves]

**Determined:**The character can spend a Fate Point after making an attack throw, proficiency throw, or saving throw to set the result of the throw to 10 (instead of re-rolling). The character cannot spend a Fate Point in this manner if the original roll was a natural 1, however. [Chosen]

**Difficult to Corrupt:** The character suffers only 1/2 the usual amount of Corruption from spending time in sinkholes of evil, using evil magic items, or from the effects of corrupting dreams. [Halflings]

**Difficult to Spot:** This power, which offered a partial version of a thief’s hiding abilities, has been removed from ***ACKS II****.* The character with this power should be assigned the **natural stealth** power instead. If the character already has that power, replace it with another class power. [Beastmaster, Explorer, Geckoman, Elven Ranger, Halfling Bounder, Nobiran Champion]

**Divine Blessing:** The character gains a +2 bonus to all saving throws. This is effectively the Divine Blessing proficiency, selected as a custom power. For flavor, dragons incarnate call this power **dragon’s luck**, gnome alchemists call it **hearty constitution**,mystics call it **harmony of spirit**, Nobirans call it **favor of the gods**, and elven cultists and Zaharan ruinguards call this **dark blessing**. [Elven Cultist of Iskara, Gnome Alchemist, Mystic, Nobirans, Zaharan Ruinguard]

**Divine Health:** The character is immune to all forms of disease, including magical diseases caused by spells, mummies, or lycanthropes. This is effectively the Divine Health proficiency selected as a custom power. For flavor, dwarven sporecasters call this power **fungal humors**,mystics call it **purity of body and soul**, necromancers call it **blessing of the dead**, paladins call it **sanctified body**, and Terran starmen call it **broad-spectrum inoculations**. [Dwarven Sporecaster, Mystic, Paladin, Nobirans, Terran Starman]

**Divine Proficiency***:* The character can select one class proficiency, choosing from Divine Blessing, Divine Health, Laying on Hands, Prophecy, and Sensing Evil. This custom power can be selected multiple times, selecting an additional proficiency each time, to a maximum limit of three selections. Note that some proficiencies available with this custom power are not useful unless the character has selected the Eldritch Talent custom power or is a caster. [Chosen]

**Discern Good:** This is effectively the Sensing Evil proficiency, but reversed and selected as a custom power. [Anti-Paladin]

**Discern Evil:** The character can detect creatures with evil intentions, magic items with evil enchantments, undead, sinkholes of evil, and summoned creatures of Chaotic alignment within 30’. (Normal characters, even if Chaotic, are not detected unless they have actively evil intentions against the character. Poisons, physical traps, and natural animals are neither good nor evil, so they are not detected by this spell. The character sees the evil creatures or objects with a sinister red glow around them, but the glow cannot be seen by anyone else. The character must have line of sight on the evil (e.g. the power does not work through walls). If the creature or object is hidden or invisible, the character will only see the glow and not the source of the evil. Sensing evil requires one full round of quiet concentration to activate. The effect lasts as long as the character continues to concentrate, to a maximum of one round per level. The effect can be used once per turn (10 minutes). This is effectively the Sensing Evil proficiency, selected as a custom power. [Paladin]

**Distract:** The character has learned a series of physical tricks, confusing nonsense, or baffling patter so profound or confusing that it serves to preternaturally distract creatures. Up to 1d6 living creatures within 30’ of the character may be affected. Creatures with the fewest HD are affected first. Each affected creature must make a Spells saving throw. Creatures already engaged in an extremely stressful or life-threatening situation (such as combat) gain a +4 bonus to saving throws to resist the distraction. Those that fail the saving throw are **mesmerized** by the antics of the character, and automatically can be surprised by naturally stealthy, hiding, or sneaking characters. The character can attempt this sort of distraction no more than once every 8 hours. [Fool]

**Dominate Beastmen:** By calling upon his implacable will and magical strength, the character can command the vile minions of Chaos to do his bidding. The character must be visible to the beastmen and be able to speak a language they understand in order to dominate them. The potency of this ability is determined by level, as noted in the Zaharan Darklord class. [Zaharan Darklord]

**Dragon’s Luck:** See **divine blessing**.

**Dragon’s Resilience:** See **savage resilience**.

**Dread Shadow:** This custom power requires that the character have the ability to **inspire dread**. It allows the character to inspire dread in any enemy unit which he can specifically identify (e.g. “the Golden Company of The Syrnasos” or “the cataphract squadron of Legate Valerian”) regardless of range. The character can likewise instill strength into any unit of dominated beastman or controlled undead under his control at any distance. The character is still limited in using these abilities no more than once per day per level. [Zaharan Darklord]

**Eldritch Talent:**The character manifests the ability to cast a spell at certain intervals. The spell selected can be of any level, up to the character’s level of experience. The spell is cast as if the character were of the minimum caster level for the spell or at his class level, whichever is greater. The frequency with which the character can cast is determined by the spells’ level. 1st – once per hour; 2nd – once per 8 hours; 3rd – once per day; 4th – once per week; 5th – once per month; 6th – once per year. The character does not have a spellbook and cannot change his repertoire. This custom power does not allow the character to use scrolls or magic items usable only by mages or crusaders. While called Eldritch Talent, the same rules apply to Arcane and Divine spells. This proficiency can be selected multiple times to gain the ability to cast additional spells. [Chosen; many other classes use a version of this to gain various spellcasting and spell-like abilities.]

**Eldritch Warrior:**When the character successfully strikes a target with a melee attack, he can expend a spell to increase damage. Damage is increased by 1d6 per level of the spell expended. Damage dealt this power counts as extraordinary arcane damage. The character must have gained spellcasting abilities from the Eldritch Talent custom power or be an eldritch caster before selecting this custom power. See also **arcane striking**.[Chosen]

**Elemental Connection:** Anytime the character is in his element, he can regain an expended spell slot with one hour (6 turns) of meditation. If in a minor place of elemental power for his element, the time required is reduced to 3 turns; in a major place of elemental power, 1 turn; and in a supreme place, 1 round. Up to one spell slot of each level can be recovered each day. For air, the character must be under open skies at the highest point within 6 miles. For earth, the character must be underground. For fire, the character must be at the site of a major fire. For water, the character must be immersed in a natural body of water such as a lake, river, or ocean. [Elven Cultist of Telith]

**Enchanted Forest**: The character can cast *forest enchantment*(as the spell) once per week. Each use takes 1 turn (10 minutes). The character can sustain a number of *forest enchantments* equal to his caster level, enabling him to enchant a vast swathe of territory (approximately 2 acres per level). [Sylvan Witch]

**Engineering Aptitude:** The character can repair technological devices in one-half the normal time for one-half the normal cost in spare parts. [Terran Starman]

**Evil Eye:** The character can hex a foe with the merest glance. He can *bestow curse* as a spell-like ability once per week. Because the Evil Eye is a spell-like ability and not a spell, he does not need to declare he is casting it before initiative, nor does taking damage or failing a saving throw prior to his initiative segment prevent him from using it. [Chthonic Witch]

**Experimentation:** The character gains a +1 bonus to magic research throws. Whenever the character engages in magic experimentation, the character gains an additional +1 bonus to the magic research throws. If the character experiences a mishap while experimenting, he can roll twice for the mishap and take whichever result he chooses. Note that this power is quite distinct from Experimenting proficiency. [Terran Engineer]

**Exquisite Torture:** The character can spend one turn (10 minutes) whipping, branding, or scarring a willing victim. An NPC under the influence of the character’s charms (from, e.g. alluring beauty, provoking the passions, or spells) will allow himself to be tortured if he fails a Spells saving throw. When the exquisite torture is complete, the character recovers hp equal to the amount of damage dealt to the victim, to a maximum of 60 hp. If the torturer chooses, he can leave the victim with one or more permanent scars, in exchange regaining one or more divine spell slots he has expended that day. By leaving a minor scar, he can regain a 1st or 2nd level spell slot. By leaving a major scar, he can regain a 3rd or 4th level spell slot. By leaving a grotesque scar, he can regain a 5th level spell slot. He can only regain one spell slot of each level per day. A character cannot benefit from exquisite torture if he has broken the strictures of his faith. [Priestess of Nasga]

**Experience and Hardiness:** Hirelings on a wilderness adventure led by this character gain a +1 bonus to their morale score. This bonus stacks with any modifiers from the explorer’s Charisma or proficiencies. [Explorer]

**Expert Bargaining**: Any items the character purchases cost 10% less than the listed price and any items he sells go for 10% more than the listed price. If trading with another venturer, or a character with the Bargaining proficiency,the opposed bargainers should make reaction rolls. Whichever character scores the higher result gets the discount. The character can select Bargaining proficiency to improve his skills. Each time the proficiency is selected, the character receives a +2 bonus on his reaction roll when negotiating with other bargainers. [Cultist of Moloch, Venturer]

**Expert Traveler:** The character begins play with their choice of Driving or Seafaring proficiency. [Venturer]

**Expert Scout:** When searching a hex, the character receives a searching throw to discover a lair every 30 minutes instead of every hour (or every 15 minutes if aerial). When first arriving in a hex, the character can attempt to assess the total number of lairs in the hex as if he had Land Surveying proficiency. If the character already has or later gains Land Surveying, this custom power stacks with the proficiency to grant the ranger a +4 bonus to his assessment throws. [Nobiran Champion]

**Extensive Firearms Training:** The character gains a +1 bonus to attack throws when using technological ranged weapons such as pistols, rifles, and launchers. [Terran Cosmonaut]

**Exult in Glorious Battle:** When the character slays a number of hit dice of creatures greater than or equal to twice his caster level in a single round, he can choose to release an exultant shout in lieu of cleaving. He must have at least one cleave left in the round to release an exultant shout. If he does so, the warlord recovers one point of stigma or stigma equivalent (e.g. confidence threshold). A character cab yell as many times as he wishes, but can recover stigma in this way only once between cleansings of stigma. [Warlord]

**Familial Loyalty:** The character can hire one more henchman than his Charisma would otherwise permit, and the base morale score of any henchmen is increased by 1, provided the henchman is related to him by blood or marriage. Any NPCs who are related to the character by blood or marriage gain a +1 bonus to their morale score when he is present. [Katripol]

**Familiar with Technology:** The character can achieve on-the-spot understanding of alien technology on a proficiency throw of 11+, and only suffers mishaps on a natural 1. *This custom power counts as 2 custom powers if selected.* [Terrans]

**Farseeing:** The character can see the fates of mortals. He can determine how many Fate Points a character has after 10 minutes (1 turn) of casual interaction or observation. Once per week, the character can cast *fate* (as the spell) with a casting time of 10 minutes (1 turn). [Chosen]

**Favor of the Gods:** See **divine blessing**.

**Fellowship of Animals**: See **animal friendship**.

**Fiery Spirit:** See **battlefield prowess**.

**Flagellation:** The character can conduct flagellation to whip himself into a furious religious zeal. He suffers 1 slashing damage per level of experience but gains a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls and becomes immune to fear. The character is limited in tactics (as per the Fighting Fury class power) while the effect lasts, and you can require the character to attack, to the best of his lethal ability, the nearest enemy of his faith, even if the player thinks this is not a prudent choice. The zealous fury lasts until the combat ends. Flagellation is a variant of **fighting fury** with a reduced cost. [Flagellant]

**Flawless Precision:** When conducting ordinary magic research (i.e. not using experimental methods), the character does not suffer automatic failures on unmodified die rolls of 2-3. An unmodified die roll of 1 is still an automatic failure, however. [Elven Wizard, Nobiran Wizard, Wizard]

**Flesh-Runes:** At 1st level, the character gains a +2 bonus to AC and decreases ordinary damage by 1 point per die. At 7th level, this protection increases to +4 AC and 2 points per die. At 13th level, the protection increases to +6 AC and 3 points per die. The damage reduction is applied per die. Damage can be reduced to 0, but not less than 0, on each die. The AC bonus from flesh-runes stacks with *potions of invulnerability*, *rings of protection*, and similar effects, but does not stack with armor. For flavor, flagellants call this power **stigmata** and revenants call it **profane endurance**. *This custom power counts as 3 custom powers if selected.* [Dwarven Fury, Flagellant, Revenant]

**Fiery Cauterization:** See **laying on hands**.

**Fiery Resistance:** The character is immune to ordinary fire damage and automatically succeeds on saving throws against spells or effects that deal mundane fire damage. The character is **resistant** to extraordinary fire damage. He reduces extraordinary fire damage dealt by half and gain a +2 bonus on saving throws against spells or special abilities that deal fire damage. [Dwarven Furnacewife]

**Fighting Fury:** At will, the character can enter a fighting fury. While furious, the character gains a +2 bonus to damage rolls and becomes immune to fear. However, the character becomes limited in his tactics. He cannot conduct defensive movement to retreat or withdraw from an enemy within 5’ and cannot move in such a way that the range between himself and the nearest visible threat would increase. He must advance 5’ after cleaving if necessary to do so to engage an enemy and he has sufficient movement. Once it has begun, a fighting fury cannot be ended until combat ends. *This custom power counts as 2 custom powers if selected.* [Dwarven Fury, Deep One Hybrid, Mog Brute, Pugilist]

**Fists of Iron:** The character gains a fist/fist attack routine. *This custom power counts as 2 or more custom powers if selected, depending on the damage of the fists*. Compare to **bone-breaking strength**, **claw and bite**, and **pugilism**.[Pugilist]

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Cost** | **Damage** |
| 2 powers | 1d3 |
| 3 powers | 1d4 |
| 4 powers | 1d6 |
| 5 powers | 1d8 |

**Flying:** The character gains a flying movement rate of 30’ per turn. *This custom power counts as 5 custom powers if selected.* [Thrassian Deathchanter]

**Fool’s Luck:** The character can spend an action to whisper a quick prayer or charm to grant himself fool’s luck. For the next 6 turns, an enemy attempting to attack or cast a spell upon the character will be foiled in the attempt and spare the character of any potential damage or malevolent effect. Until 6 turns have passed, the character can be spared 1d4 times before his luck is exhausted. Area-effect spells and area attacks cannot be protected against, nor will they exhaust any potential instances of fool’s luck the character currently possesses. Fool’s luck can be invoked no more than once every 8 hours. [Fool]

**Four Arms:** The character has four limbs available for manipulating objects and wielding weapons, and can fight with all four at once! The character can wield as many as four small one-handed weapons (such as hand axes and short swords), one per hand; three small-one handed weapons and possibly one shield; two small-one handed weapons and one or two shields; one two-handed medium or large weapon in one pair of hands and a shield or weapon in a third hand, or a pair of weapons or shields in the other hands; or a pair of two-handed medium or large weapons. The character cannot wield more than 2 shields at any one time, however.

The new fighting styles available to the character, and the benefits gained from Fighting Style proficiency, are shown on the accompanying table. The character can also use the ordinary fighting styles available to human fighters, as well (e.g. two weapon fighting). Note that the character only has one attack in its attack routine, regardless of how many weapons it carries. If the character class has a Fighting Value of less than 2, it does not get access to the new four-armed fighting styles unless it allocates some or all of its fighting style choices to them. If the four-armed character is equipped with magic weapons or shields, he can benefit from, at most, the attack bonus of two weapons, the damage bonus of one weapon, the AC bonus of one shield. *This custom power counts as 2 powers if selected.* [Bugman Praetor]

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Style** | **Base Bonus** | **Fighting Style Proficiency** |
| 1 small weapon & 2 shields | +2 to armor class (from 2 shields) | Additional +1 to armor class |

| 2 small weapons & 2 shields | +1 to attack throws, +2 to armor class (from 2 shields) | Additional +1 to armor class |

**Forbidden Spells:** The character can add one spell of each level from another magic type to his class list at their normal spell levels for that magic type. This does not increase his repertoire; it merely makes it possible to learn spells that are otherwise unavailable. For flavor, wizards call this **secret knowledge**.[Wizard]

**Friend of Birds and Beasts:** The character is well-schooled in the natural world. He can identify plants and fauna with a proficiency throw of 11+. He understands the vocalizations and body language of birds and beasts, enabling him to understand any simple messages the animals might be communicating (such as “danger is nearby, be alert” “you’re unfamiliar and strange,” or “do not come closer, we are guarding our den!”). Because of his innate understanding of the language of beasts, the character also counts as proficient for purposes of handling trained animals in their roles such as droving or shepherding. He gains +2 to all reaction rolls when encountering normal animals and can take animals as henchmen. He can train and handle animal henchmen to perform tricks or serve a particular role without having to separately possess Animal Training. This is effectively the Beast Friendship proficiency, selected as a custom power. If the character has this power and that proficiency, he can identify plants and fauna with a throw of 7+ and can take one more henchman than his Charisma would otherwise permit, as long as at least one is an animal. [Beastmaster, Chosen, Elven Ranger, Elven Wizard, Nobiran Wizard, Sylvan Witch, Wizard]

**Fungal Awareness:** The character gains the power to detect fungus, molds, slimes, and oozes within 60’. The character must concentrate for 1 turn (10 minutes) to activate the power. Once activated, the power lasts as long as the character maintains concentration. [Dwarven Sporecaster]

**Fungal Communion:** The character can commune directly with the omnipresent great fungi once per week. Fungal communion functions like the spell *contact other sphere.* [Dwarven Sporecaster]

**Fungal Friendship:** If the characters touches a fungus, mold, or ooze, he learns its species and type with a proficiency throw of 8+. Because he understands the subtle language by which the mycoflora whisper to each other, he gains +2 to all reaction rolls when encountering fungus, molds, and oozes. He can take fungus, molds, and oozes as henchmen (HD permitting) and give them simple instructions by concentrating at touch range. [Dwarven Sporecaster]

**Fungal Immunity:** From long exposure to the spores and toxins released by mycoflora, the character has become immune to the toxic effects of fungi and mold. He never suffers a delusionary or detrimental effect when imbibing a dwarven brew. He takes no damage or effects from any type of oozes (though his equipment is affected normally) and is immune to the deadly spores of molds. [Dwarven Sporecaster]

**Fungal Spawn (10th):** The character can share his mycological gifts with other creatures, welcoming them into the moist embrace of the mold. He can create fungal crossbreeds as if he were a mage of 11th level. All of the standard rules for crossbreeding creatures apply, except that one of the progenitor creatures must always be a fungus, mold, or ooze of some sort. Whatever he creates is automatically Friendly to him and can be recruited as a henchman (HD permitting). The character can crossbreed himself if desired.

**Gather Together the Darkness:** If the character has established a chaotic domain, then each month, his domain gains an extra 1d10 beastman families for every 1,000 beastmen in his realm, until its maximum population density is achieved. If he has established a chaotic realm, every chaotic domain in his realm gains additional beastmen at the same rate as well. [Zaharan Darklord]

**Gift of Tongues:**See **bonus languages**.

**Glamorous Aura:** The character is able to project a glamorous aura that awes, bedazzles and seduces those in his presence. He gains a +1 bonus to reaction rolls to impress and intimidate people he encounters. If this bonus results in a total of 12 or more, the subjects act as if *bewitched*while in his presence. This is effectively the Mystic Aura proficiency, selected as a custom power. For flavor, the elven spellsinger calls this power **irresistible voice**, the priestess of Nasga calls it **ravishing beauty**, and the warmistress calls its **alluring beauty** [Cultist of Lotan, Elven Cultist of Nasga, Elven Enchanter, Priestess of Nasga, Warmistress]

**Graceful Fighting:** See **blade-dancing**.

**Greater Rite of Sealing:** Once per week, the character can perform a rite that permanently seals a door, portal, or chest shut. It requires 1 round to perform the rite (like a spell). The character can freely open the sealed door without affecting it; otherwise, a door or object secured with the rite of sealing can be opened only by breaking in or with a successful *dispel magic*spell by a caster of greater level than the tombsealer. The tombsealer can maintain a number of sealed doors equal to his class level. Doors sealed with this rite remain sealed until *dispelled* or destroyed, persisting even if the tombsealer dies. The maximum number of sealed doors the character can maintain is permanently reduced by one each time he uses his greater rite of sealing. [Dwarven Tombsealer]

**Greatness of Soul:** See **battlefield prowess**.

**Grey Lore:** The character gains the ability to rebuke undead as a crusader of one half his class level. When the character casts spells that require a Death or Paralysis saving throw, the target suffers a -1 penalty and the character counts as one class level higher than his actual level of experience. His eligibility to research death and protection magic is determined as if he were one caster level higher than actual. He gains a +1 bonus on magic research throws and increases his research rate by 5% when researching death or protection magic.

**Grotesque Arts of Transformation (1st):** When the character casts transmogrification spells, the spell effects are calculated as if he were two class levels higher than his actual level of experience. His eligibility to create crossbreeds or research transmogrification magic is determined as if he were two caster levels higher than actual. Targets of his transmogrification spells suffer a -2 penalty to their saving throw. He gains a +2 bonus on magic research throws and increases his research rate by 10% when creating crossbreeds or researching transmogrification magic. Grotesque Arts can stack with the Transmogrification proficiency, such that the character’s transmogrification spells are calculated as if he were three (rather than two) caster levels higher and and his bonus to magic research and research rate is increased to +3 and 15%. [Warlock]

**Guardian Spirit:** The character is protected by an ancestor or nature spirit who favors him. The spirit is invisible but may materialize at will. It must stay within 30’ of the character at all times. The guardian spirit can move at a rate of 120', has AC 2, has one attack dealing 1d3 points of magic luminous damage, and can climb like a gecko. The spirit guardian is as intelligent as the character. It can understand the character’s speech, and the character can understand his guardian spirit’s speech, though no one else (except for others of his class) can do so without resorting to a *tongues* spell. So long as the character upholds his class’s requirements (usually a divine code), the guardian spirit will be utterly loyal to the character and will fight for him, perform services, and generally respond to any reasonable request. [Geckoman Spirit-Talker]

**Hard to Kill:** See **savage resilience**.

**Heroic Spirit:** Because of the character’s courageous spirit, the maximum class level for the character’s class is increased by 1. *This custom power may only be selected by classes with a maximum class level of 13 or lower.* [Nobirans]

**Hideous Servant:** Experiments combining living creatures with the character’s own flesh and blood have created a hideous servantintimately bonded to his will. The character’ hideous servant is mechanically similar to a shaman’s totem animal. However, the character selects two of his hideous servant’s characteristics (AC, Movement, attack routine, and special abilities) from one animal and two characteristics from another, while the servant’s base Hit Dice are set to the average of the two animals selected. (Remember that actual HD will be adjusted by the character’s level.) The character does not gain a totem benefit. [Elven Wizard, Zaharan Sorcerer, Warlock]

**Holy Fervor:** Any hirelings of the same religion as the character gain a +1 bonus to their morale score whenever he is present. For flavor, anti-paladins call this **unholy fanaticism**. [Anti-Paladin, Flagellant, Lizardman Priestess, Paladin]

**Horrible Truths:** See **ancient pacts**.

**Impersonate Others:** This power has been removed from ***ACKS II****.* Replace it with one rank of Disguise proficiency. [Mountebank]

**Implacable Will:** This custom power extends the duration of a character’s domination of beastmen. Whenever the character succeeds in dominating beastmen (whether from a roll or automatically from an “A” result), the creatures are dominated for 1 day per level instead of the usual 1 turn per level. If the creatures would have been dominated for 1 day per level (from an “X” result), the creatures are instead controlled indefinitely. See also l**ordship over the undead** [Zaharan Darklord]

**Inexorable:** See **strength of spirit**.

**Infravision:** See **lightless vision.**

**Inhumanity:** The character suffers a penalty to the reactions, loyalty, and morale of humans and demi-humans. The character gets an equivalent bonus to the reactions, loyalty, and morale with a particular monster type. For flavor, bugmen call this **alien beings** and deep one hybrids call it **tainted blood**.

**Initiative:** The character receives a +1 bonus to initiative rolls, including combat and spellcasting. For flavor, Geckomen call this power **lizard brain**. [Bladedancer, Geckomen]

He gains a +2 bonus on magic research throws and increases his research rate by 10% when researching illusion magic. *This custom power counts as 1/2 custom power if selected*. [Gnomish Trickster]

**Innovative Researcher:** The character is capable of devising solutions that other spellcasters would never even conceive of. His insight advantage from using experimental methods is doubled from +2 to +4. [Wizard]

An inspired creature gains a +1 bonus to attack throws, armor class, morale rolls (for monsters or NPCs allied with the caster), and saving throws against magical **fear**. The bonus lasts for 10 minutes (1 turn). A character can inspire courage once per day per class level. (Even the most inspired epic gets stale if you hear it twice in the same day.) A character cannot inspire courage on characters who are already engaged in combat. For flavor, Thrassian deathchanters call this power **rouse to fury** and warlords call it **battle plan.** [Bard, Chosen, Dragon Incarnate, Dwarven Rhetor, Elven Courtier, Elven Cultist of Bel, Elven Warlord, Nobiran Champion, Nobiran Wizard, Thrassian Deathchanter, Warlord, Wizard]

**Inspire Dread:** The character can cause fear in its foes.Inspiring dread requires a few moments of oration (one round), and causes up to 30 of the character’s opponents within a 50' radius to become **shaken**. A shaken creature suffers a -1 penalty to attack throws, armor class, morale rolls (for monsters or NPCs allied with the caster), and saving throws against magical **fear**. The penalty lasts for 10 minutes (1 turn). The character can only attempt to inspire dread once per day per class level. Opponents receive a Paralysis saving throw to resist the effect. When used on the battlefield this ability can affect one enemy unit in an adjacent hex. [Elven Cultist of Dirgion, Zaharan Darklord, Zaharan Sorcerer]

**Inspire Exceptional Performance:** The character can inspire excellence in its allies. Inspiring exceptional performance requires a few moments of oration (one round) and grants up to 30 of the character’s allies within a 50’ radius a +1 bonus to initiative rolls, attack throws, and proficiency throws for 10 minutes (1 turn). The character can inspire exceptional performance once per day per class level. [Terran Starman]

A character can inspire hope once per day when he gains this power, and one additional time per day with each level thereafter. Ecclesiastics call this power **rally the faithful**. *This custom power counts as 2 powers if selected*. [Bard, Ecclesiastic]

**Instill Strength:** Instilling strength is only open to characters who can dominate beastmen or control undead. It requires a few moments of oration (one round), and grants dominated beastmen or controlled undead within 30’ a pool of temporary hit pointsequal to the lower of the character’s or the creature’s base healing rate. These temporary hit points last for one turn (10 minutes) or until lost to damage, whichever comes first. The character can instill strength once per day per level. (When used on the battlefield this ability can affect one friendly unit in the character’s hex.) [Zaharan Darklord]

**Jumping:** The character can leap up to 30’ in a round as a movement action.

This movement is not constrained by being engaged. *This custom power counts as 4 powers if selected.* [Bugman Praetor]

**Keen Eyes:** This power, which offered a partial version of a thief’s searching abilities, has been removed from ***ACKS II****.* In lieu of this power, the elven power **attunement to nature** has been made more powerful. [Chosen, Elven Courtier, Elven Enchanter, Elven Nightblade, Elven Ranger, Elven Spellsword]

**Keen Insect Senses:** See **Alertness**.

**Killing Spree:** See **berserkergang, lesser**.

**Kinship with Arthropods and Fungi:** The character can identify arthropods and fungi with a proficiency throw of 11+, and understands the subtle body language and moods of arthropods and fungal creatures (though they may not understand the character) automatically.

See also **friend of birds and beasts**. [Bugman Ovate]

**Kiss of Life**: The character’s lungs become home to colonies of a highly active strain of necrofungus. While the character can still create spore zombies as normal, he may instead breath into the mouth of a mostly intact corpse to animate it as a spore zombie in a single round. Spore zombies created this way are rapidly consumed by the variant fungus and become mushy pulp in only an hour, though they remain animated until destroyed if sprinkled with clubhead mushroom brew. The character must have **necrosporing** custom power to select this power. [Dwarven Sporecaster]

**Laugh at Pain:** The character ignores any penalty from Permanent Wounds 21-25/1 or 26+/1 (wounds that ache).

[Priestess of Nasga]

For flavor, the warlord calls this **iron leadership**.[Chosen, Elven Warlord, Nobiran Champion, Warlord]

**Lizard Brain:** See **initiative**.

**Loadbearing:** The character reduces his effective encumbrance by 2 stone for purposes of determining his speed. [Dwarven Excavator, Nobiran Champion]

**Majesty of the Dragon:** See **command of voice**.

**Malevolent Reputation:** This power makes it easier to recruit large hosts of minions when dominating beastmen or controlling undead (chosen when the power is selected).

He can continue fighting until he reaches a negative number of hit points equal or exceeding his Constitution score or until he stays conscious for a number of rounds equal to his level of experience.

The price of using martyrdom is that the character he suffers a penalty of -1 per level of experience to both Mortal Wounds and Tampering with Mortality rolls related to that injury. [Flagellant]

**Marvelous Machines:** The character is capable of creating marvelous machines that blend science and magic. The wizard is able to design and build constructs at half the usual material cost and research cost for his class. [Elven Wizard, Nobiran Wizard]

**Mitigate Damage**: The character can reduce damage by absorbing the blow on his armor or shield. When the character mitigates damage, the damage dealt by the attack is reduced to 1 point. The excess damage is absorbed by the character’s armor or shield, which is reduced in effectiveness (AC) by 1 point per 10 points of damage mitigated (rounded up). In addition, if the amount of damage mitigated is greater than the character’s current hit points, then he is also knocked **prone.** The character cannot mitigate damage if he is backstabbed, choking/vomiting, cowering, faltering, frightened, grabbed, helpless, incapacitated, infuriated, mad, mesmerized, paralyzed, petrified, prone, slumbering, surprised, unconscious, or wrestled. Special maneuvers cannot be mitigated, nor can damage from critical hits, magic, or area of effect attacks.

Thereafter, he earns 1gp per month in monopoly revenue per urban family in the urban settlement. He does not need to be the domain’s ruler to earn this revenue; if he is the domain’s ruler, the monopoly revenue is in addition to his domain revenue. Only one venturer in each urban settlement can earn monopoly revenue from each urban family. If there is more than one venturer with this class power operating in the settlement, then either the character must eliminate his rival(s) or he must come to a deal to distribute the monopoly revenue between the various venturers. [Venturer].

**Mushroom Management:** The character learns how to apply his mycocultural knowledge at large scale. Each month in which the character is on hand to personally manage dwarven mushroom farms, the domain’s piltgarin families generate an additional 1gp of land revenue each. Personally managing mushroom farms requires 20 days of major activity. The character must either be the domain ruler or have the permission of the domain ruler to supervise the mushroom farms. [Dwarven Sporecaster]

**Mushroom Overlord:** The character can manipulate the varietals of mushrooms in a non-dwarven domain to make them farmable by other sapient races. The character must either be the domain ruler or have the permission of the domain ruler and must personally supervise the mushroom farms. He can organize work-gangs of any sapient race to work mushroom farms that he personally oversees. Every family or every 5 conscripts or slaves yields one work-gang. Each work-gang functions like a piltgarin family for purposes of mushroom farming. If a domain’s population consists of 25% or more involuntary work gangs, its base morale score is decreased by 1. While a domain’s population consists of 50% or more involuntary work gangs, its base morale score is decreased by 2. While a domain is 100% involuntary work gangs, its domain morale is decreased by 4. If at any time the domain’s current morale score becomes -2 (Turbulent) or worse, some or all of the work gangs will rise up in revolt, becoming rebels. Fortunately (for the ruler, anyway), it’s much easier to suppress a rebellion by workers laboring in confined mushroom farms than it is to stop peasant uprisings across the countryside. If the ruler has a garrison worth at least 2gp per work gang present in the domain, then one-half the rebels are automatically slain and the remainder return to work the following month. [Dwarven Sporecaster]

**Mystical Bloodline:** See **longeval**.

**Multilingual:** See **bonus languages**.

**Natural Stealth:** Opponents suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls when encountering the character approaching from outside line of sight or lying in wait in cover or darkness. [Barbarian, Beastmaster, Explorer]

**Necrosporing:** The character can create spore zombies like a dwarven sporecaster. [Dwarven Sporecaster]

**Nervous Watchfulness:** See **animal reflexes**.

**Nose for Potions:** The character can make a proficiency throw of 11+ to determine the magical properties of a potion or oil on taste. Starting at 5th level, the character can brew potions as if a mage of his class level. *This custom power counts as 2 1/2 custom powers if selected.* [Gnomes]

**Oneness of Land and Lord:** The character’s hit points are increased by 2 x the current morale score of his domain (a negative morale score will decrease his hp). Provided the character remains Lawful, healthy, and free of corrupting weaknesses, his domain’s Land Value is increased by 2gp, as if it were benefitting from a Harvest ritual. If the character is Neutral, but otherwise healthy and uncorrupted, there is no effect. If the character is suffering from a curse, disease, or corrupting weakness, then his domain’s Land Value is decreased by 2gp, as if it were suffering from a Ravage ritual. This custom power has no effect if the character is not the ruler of a domain. [Nobiran Champion]

**Pathfinding:** When the character guides a party in familiar territory, the party gains a +4 bonus on proficiency throws to avoid getting lost. At 1st level, a character is considered familiar with the civilized areas of his starting region as well as all territory within one 24-mile hex radius of civilized areas. With each additional level of experience, the radius increases one 24-mile hex further from civilization. Pathfinding stacks with Navigation proficiency. Beastmasters and lizardman hunters call this power **avoid getting lost**. [Beastmaster, Explorer, Lizardman Hunter, Venturer]

**Perceive Intentions:** The character always know the exact reaction result (Hostile, Unfriendly, etc.) of creatures he interacts with, even if the creatures attempt to lie or conceal their reactions. Creatures with a CHA greater than the character’s WIL are immune to this power (and the character will know they are immune). [Mystic, Nephilim]

**Perfection of Body:** See **longeval**.

**Personal Talisman:** The character has a personal talisman that provides a +1 bonus to ceremony throws for ceremonies of one particular type. (The character can choose from death & necromancy; detection; elemental air; elemental earth; elemental fire; elemental water; enchantment & illusion; healing; movement; protection; summoning; and transmogrification). [Dwarven Furnacewife, Loremaster, Occultist]

**Placate:** The character can placate his opponents use disarming words, glib talk, or submissive body language, until help arrives. The character cannot attack while placating, but can move at 1/2 speed or can perform an action in lieu of moving, such as standing up from being knocked down, picking an item off the ground, or retrieving an item from a pack or sack. The character cannot placate if he, or any other members of his race with this power in his party, have already attacked an opponent during the present encounter. When a character is placating, any opponent attempting to strike or otherwise directly attack him must make a Spells saving throw. If the save succeeds, the opponent can attack the character normally that round. If the save fails, the opponent will not attack the character that round and will attack another creature instead. Area effects may still affect the character. Mindless creatures and fantastic creatures of animal intelligence cannot be placated, but ordinary animals and all sapient creatures are susceptible to the character’s cringing placation. [Halfling Bounder, Halfling Burglar]

**Power of Sacrifice:** The character can gain either arcane or divine power by blood sacrifice, and counts any power gained from blood sacrifice as double its gp value. He can store the arcane power from blood sacrifices indefinitely, even when not actively performing magical research.. [Warlock, Zaharan Sorcerer]

**Precise Shot:** The character can make a missile attack against an unengaged enemy target without penalty. The character can attack an engaged enemy target at a -4 penalty and ignore up to 4 points of cover. This is effectively the Precise Shooting proficiency, selected as a custom power, and the character may take ranks in the Precise Shooting proficiency to reduce this penalty to -2 or less. [Elven Ranger]

**Prestidigitation:** The character can magically accomplish simple illusions and sleight of hand tricks suitable for impressing peasants, such as lighting a candle or shuffling cards, at will. The character must be able to perform the task physically, and be free to speak and gesture. He can use magical sleight-of-hand to pick pockets as a thief of one half his class level. This is effectively the Prestidigitation proficiency, selected as a custom power. [Elven Enchanter, Gnomish Trickster]

**Probability Trance:** The character can cast *divination* once per day. [Mystic]

**Profane Endurance:** See **flesh-runes**.

**Provoke the Passion:** Through teasing, taunting, and flirting the character can use her alluring beauty to provoke the passions ofanintelligent creature that is potentially attracted to her. Provoking the passions of a creature is a full round action, during which the character must remain stationary and take no other action. A creature must be within 30’ of the character and able to both see and hear her in order to be the target of provocation. The targeted creature must make a Spells saving throw. You might grant bonuses or penalties to the saving throw depending on circumstances, the temperament of the creature, and its training or familiarity with the character. If the save succeeds, the creature is not provoked. If the save fails, the creature is provoked for 1d4 rounds plus 1 round per level of the character. The effect of provocation depends on the creature’s current reaction to the character. A hostile creature will become enraged, attacking the characters in preference to all others without regard for its own safety for the duration of the provocation. An unfriendly creature will become hostile, seeking to verbally or physically harass the character for the duration. A neutral creature will become distracted, ignoring other duties or activities to pay attention to the character for the duration. An indifferent creature will become friendly, seeking to assist the character for the duration. A friendly creature will become enamored, helping the character as if *bewitched*for the duration of the provocation. If the character or one of her allies attacks a creature while it is provoked, it immediately becomes enraged. [Elven Cultist of Nasga, Priestess of Nasga, Warmistress]

**Public Education:** The character’s domain gains a 1gp increase in its service revenue due to the character’s mastery of the useful arts and crafts. However, the domain ruler is expected to spend this additional revenue on agricultural improvement, urban improvement, or warfare to defend the domain against invaders or chaotic realms. A domain ruler using the funds for any other purpose reduces his domain’s base morale score by 1. [Katripol]

**Public Flagellation:** The character inspires conviction in his comrades. Public flagellation requires a few moments (one round), during which time the character deals 2 hp of damage per level to himself. All allies within 30’ of the character then gain temporary hit points equal to the lower of the character's or the ally's number of Hit Dice. These temporary hit points last for one turn (10 minutes) or until lost to damage, whichever comes first. To benefit from this ability, the subjects be of the same alignment and religion of the character. Each time this power is used, the character acquires a minor scar (as per the Permanent Wounds table). [Flagellant]

**Pugilism:** The character is an expert in striking with his fists. He can make two attacks per round with his bare hands. The barehanded blows deal 1d3 damage or more each (modified by STR as usual). He can deal nonlethal damage or lethal damage as desired. He can punch characters in metal armor without himself taking damage. He can use the Weapon Finesse proficiency with his fists. *This custom power counts as 3 or more customer powers if selected, depending on the damage of the fists. Each additional custom power can increase the damage by one die.* [Dwarven Pugilist]

**Purity of Body and Soul:** See **divine health**.

**Pyroclastics:** The character is an expert in safely using explosives and incendiaries in dangerous subterranean environments to collapse tunnels, demolish rock, and shatter stone. He attacks as a fighter of his class level when hurling burning oil or petards. Anytime he fumbles with burning oils or petards, he can avoid setting himself aflame or detonating the petard with a successful Paralysis saving throw. Finally, he deals +1 damage at 1st level with burning oil or petards, and deals an additional +1 at 3rd, 6th, and 9th level. This bonus applies to both direct and splash damage but not to ongoing damage. If he has the Ambushing proficiency, he can ambush with oil to deal additional damage on a direct hit. He may cleave with oil provided he has lit flasks at hand. [Dwarven Excavator]

**Quickening:** See **animal reflexes**.

**Rally the Faithful:** See **inspire hope**.

**Ravishing Beauty:** See **glamorous aura**.

**Read Languages:** See **deciphering.**

**Relentless:** See **connection to nature**.

**Rhetoric:** The character’s speeches can be used to cast certain rhetorical effects (spells) on his listeners, as a dwarven rhetor. [Dwarven Rhetor]

**Right Stuff:** Anytime the character is reduced to one-half his maximum hit points or less during an encounter, the character immediately gains a +1 bonus to armor class, attack throws, proficiency throws, saving throws, and initiative rolls. The bonus lasts until the end of the encounter for one turn (10 minutes) or until he is healed, whichever comes first. [Terran Cosmonaut]

**Rouse to Fury:** See **inspire courage**.

**Rotless Rot:** The character with this power does not suffer from age-related penalties to his ability scores. Anytime he fails a saving throw vs Death due to advancing age, instead of dying he gains a Mutation of the Flesh from the Gifts of the Great Fungi table in ***By This Axe****.* [Dwarven Sporecaster]

**Rumormongering:** The character can automatically learn 1d4 interesting rumors from old contacts and commercial associates any time he re-visits an urban settlement he has previously done business in. Rumormongering requires one day of major activity (6 hours) in an urban settlement. A character can rumormonger in any given urban settlement only once per month.

**Sanctified Body:** See **divine health**.

**Savage Resilience:** When the character is required to consult the Mortal Woundstable, the player may roll twice and choose the preferred result to apply. The character also subtracts his class level from the number of days of bed rest required to recover. For flavor, bugmen, chosen, and dwarven pugilists call this power **hard to kill**, while dragons incarnate call it **dragon’s resilience**, and elven cultists call it **supernatural resilience**.[Barbarian, Beastmaster, Bugmen, Chosen, Dwarven Fury, Dwarven Pugilist, Elven Cultist of Bel]

**Scaly Hide:** The character has a scaly hide which increases his unarmored AC to 1 or more. A heavy scaly hide might reduce the character’s base movement rate. For flavor, bugmen call this power **chitinous carapace.** *This custom power counts as 1 or more custom powers if selected, depending on the AC*. [Bugmen, Cultist of Bokrug, Lizardmen, Thrassians]

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Cost** | **Armor Class** | **Base Move Reduction** |
| 1 power | 1 | 0’ |
| 2 powers | 2 | -30’ |
| 3 powers | 3 | -60’ |
| 4 powers | 4 | -60’ |
| 5 powers | 5 | -60’ |

**Scientific Mindset:** The character can use alien technology as if he were an arcane spellcaster. [Terrans]

**Scion of Kings:** See **blood of kings**.

**Second Sight:** The character has a connection to the hidden world, and can see innately or magically invisible creatures within 60’. Invisible creatures are aware that the character can see them, and might take a particular interest in him as a result. Second Sight does not provide the ability to see creatures or features hidden through cover or darkness. [Antiquarian Witch, Chosen]

**Secret Knowledge:** See **forbidden spells**.

**Secretion:** The character gains the ability to exude a particular type of secretion by touching a creature. When this power is selected, the character learns how to exude one secretion, based on any dwarven brew recipe known to him. The effect of the secretion on the creature touched is identical to the effect of drinking the dwarven brew. Exuding a secretion follows the rules for casting a spell. The character must declare the attempt before rolling initiative, must remain stationary, and must not take damage before his initiative count arrives. The character must make an attack throw to touch a creature that does not wish to be touched. Secretion can be selected as a power multiple times in order to be able to exude different secretions. [Dwarven Sporecaster]

**Secrets of the Dark Arts:** He can control undead as a Chaotic crusader of one half his class level. If the character casts death spells, his targets suffer a -2 penalty on their saving throws. When the character casts necromantic spells (such as **animate undead**), the spell effects are calculated as if he were two class levels higher than his actual level of experience. His eligibility to research death or necromancy magic is determined as if he were two caster levels higher than actual. He gains a +2 bonus on magic research throws and increases his research rate by 10% when researching death or necromancy magic. While this is effectively Black Lore of Zahar proficiency selected as a custom power, consider Secrets of the Dark Acts as a separate custom power and allow it to stack with the proficiency, such that the character can control undead as a crusader of two-thirds his class level (rounded up), and his death and necromancy spells and research are calculated as if he were three (rather than two) caster levels higher than his actual caster level. [Elven Wizard, Occultist, Lizardman Witch-Doctor, Necromancer, Warlock, Zaharan Sorcerer]

**Secrets of Life and Death:** The character can perform necromancy at half the usual material cost and research cost. [Elven Wizard, Warlock, Zaharan Sorcerer]

**Sensitivity to Rock and Stone:** The character gains a +1 bonus to surprise rolls when underground. When using Adventuring proficiency to search or listen, they succeed on a proficiency throw of 14+ (instead of the usual 18+). If separately proficient in Searching they gain a +4 bonus to their throw instead. If separately proficient in Listening, they gain a +2 bonus to their throw instead. *This power counts as 1 1/2 class powers if selected.* [Dwarves]

**Shapechange:** The character can shapechange into one specific type of normal animal once per day per level of experience. While in animal form, the character has the movement, armor class, attacks, damage, and special abilities of the animal. He retains his normal Hit Dice, hit points, attack throws, and saving throws. If the character is of greater Hit Dice than his animal type, he will appear as a bigger, stronger version of the animal, to a maximum of twice normal size. For example, a 10th level character in lion shape would appear as a huge predator, twice the mass of a normal lion. Apart from size, the shaman is indistinguishable from a normal animal. The totem animal shape does not detect as magical, is not detected by spells that reveal illusions, and cannot be **dispelled**. Changing shape can be performed during combat as an action in lieu of an attack. [Berserker, Shaman]

**Shape Flesh and Bone:** The character is able to create magical crossbreeds at half the usual material cost and research cost. [Elven Wizard, Warlock, Zaharan Sorcerer]

**Sleepless:** The character does not have to sleep and cannot sleep even if it desires to do so. He can ignore the effects of the *slumbering* conditions. [Revenant]

**Solidity of Rock:** The character gains a +4 bonus vs. being grabbed, knocked down, restrained, wrestled, or otherwise involuntarily moved. [Elven Cultist of Bel]

**Soul of the Dragon:** See **blood of kings**.

**Speak with Animals:** The character can *speak with beasts* (as the spell) at will. [Cultist of Qetesh, Gnomes]

**Speak with Arthropods:** The character can *speak with arthropods*at will. Treat this effect as *speak with beasts*but the power works with vermin instead of beasts. [Bugman Ovate]

**Speed of Thought:** See **animal reflexes**.

**Spell Storing:** When the character casts a spell that would normally target a creature, he can instead cast it into his melee weapon, where it remains stored until discharged. The effect will discharge onto the next creature the character strikes with the weapon, resulting in both melee damage and the normal effects of the spell. The character can only store one spell at a time, and the spell will discharge harmlessly if not used in 1 turn, if the weapon is sundered, or if the character loses his grip on the weapon. *This custom power counts as 1 power with Arcane Value 1-2 and 2 powers with Arcane Value 3-4.* [Zaharan Ruinguard]

**Spiritwalk:** The character can spiritwalk, following the procedures detailed in the shaman class. After 1 turn (10 minutes) of chanting, the character enters a deep trance during which his spirit walks free of his body. If the spiritwalking character can assume multiple forms, the spirit can assume any of those forms as desired. The effects are otherwise identical to the 5th level spell *spiritwalk.* Spiritwalking is so taxing that it can be performed but once per week. [Berserker, Geckoman Spirit-talker, Shaman]

**Spore Calibration:** The character’s communion with his spore zombies is so total that they become capable of more complex activities. The spore zombies can be assigned to work on piltgarin farms or on mines, with five spore zombies equaling one dwarven family. The spore zombies never rebel and are unaffected by domain morale. The character must have **necrosporing** custom power to select this power. [Dwarven Sporecaster]

**Spore Fermentation:** The character can cause a spore zombie’s innards to rapidly ferment, bloating with gasses that create a destructive blast when released. Preparing an explosive spore zombie takes 1 turn (10 minutes) but can be done simultaneously with that spore zombie’s creation. Whenever an explosive spore zombie is destroyed, the eruption of gas deals 2d6 points of damage to everything within a 10’ radius, with a saving throw versus Blast for half damage. The character can command an explosive spore zombie to destroy itself in lieu of it attacking. Even if sprinkled with clubfoot brew, an explosive spore zombie lasts only one day before exploding on its own, its body no longer able to contain the gasses. The character must have **necrosporing** custom power to select this power. [Dwarven Sporecaster]

**Spore Perception:** By concentrating, the character can access the visual, auditory, and tactile senses of one spore zombie or sporecalled henchman within range of his communication spores, subject to the normal limitations of high winds. The character must have **necrosporing** custom power to select this power. [Dwarven Sporecaster]

**Spore Synchronization:** Spore zombies created by a character with this power act on their master’s initiative in combat when within control range, rather than attacking last each round. The character must have **necrosporing** custom power to select this power. [Dwarven Sporecaster]

**Stalwart Soul:** The character’s soul is pure as gold and hard as steel. He is immune to enervation, mummy rot, and aging effects caused by undead. Even if slain by infectious undead he never rises in undeath, and his remains cannot be made into undead by necromantic magic of any sort. [Dwarven Tombsealer]

**Steady Trade Route:** The character can establish a steady trade route for transactions in any two types of merchandise between any two of the markets that he has visited. The trade route’s markets, and the specific type of merchandise that is bought and sold at each market, is chosen by the character when he establishes the trade route. Thereafter, anytime the venturer personally enters one of the trade route’s markets, he can add one-half his class level to his market impact when assessing determining the amount of merchandise of that type available for purchase or sale. If that results in his market impact exceeding the market maximum, he can advance to the next highest market class. The transactions occur at the prevailing market price in the markets, so it behooves the character to select two markets with different Demand Modifiers so he can arbitrage prices. [Venturer II]

**Strength of Spirit:** The character is immune to all natural and magical fear effects. For flavor, Chosen call this power **courage**, Terran cosmonauts call it **daredevil**, and elven cultists and Zaharan ruinguards call it **inexorable**. [Chosen, Dragon Incarnate, Elven Cultist of Dirgion, Mystic, Nobiran Veil Dancer, Terran Cosmonaut, Zaharans]

**Steward of the Wild:** See **animal friendship**.

**Stigmata:** See **flesh-runes**.

**Student of War:**The character can select one proficiency, choosing Command, Military Strategy, Leadership, or Siege Engineering. This custom power can be selected multiple times, selecting an additional proficiency or proficiency rank each time. [Chosen, Elven Warlord, Nobiran Champion]

**Subtle Beguilement:** When casting enchantment spells, the character counts as having the Quiet Magic proficiency. If he already has Quiet Magic proficiency, he can cast enchantment spells using subvocalized words and no hand gestures. In either case, targets of his enchantment spells suffer a -2 penalty to their saving throw, or a -3 penalty if he also has Mastery of Enchantment & Illusions proficiency. [Chthonic Witch]

**Summon Infernal Powers:** The character can cast *summon invisible stalker*once per month. It takes 1 turn (10 minutes) to cast. [Occultist, Sorcerer]

**Supernatural Resilience:** See **savage resilience**.

**Survivability of Cockroaches:** The character is **immune** to all forms of disease, including magical diseases such as those caused by spells, mummies, or lycanthropes.The character is also **immune** to mundane poisonous damage and automatically succeeds on saving throws against poisons with effects other than immediate death. He is **resistant** to extraordinary poisonous damage and gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against poisons with the effect of immediate death. *This custom power counts as 2 powers, because it combines Divine Health and Wholeness of Body.* [Bugmen]

**Swimming:** The character gains a swimming movement rate and can hold his breath for an extended period of time. Note that this class power differs from the Swimming proficiency. *This custom power counts as 2 or more custom powers if selected, depending on the ability gained.* [Cultist of Rahab, Deep One Hybrid, Thrassians]

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Cost** | **Swim Rate** | **Hold Breath Duration (Rounds)** |
| 2 power | 60’ | 10 + CON modifier |
| 2 1/2 powers | 90’ | 30 + 3 x CON modifier |
| 3 powers | 120’ | 60 + 6 x CON modifier |

**Sworn Foe:** When this custom power is selected, the character must designate one specific individual monster or NPC by its name or unique physical characteristic (e.g. “the six-fingered man”). That creature becomes his sworn foe. The character gains a +2 bonus to attack throws and saving throws when confronting his sworn foe. If the character lands a successful attack on his sworn foe (including spells), the character can spend a Fate Point to deal double damage dice from the attack. If the sworn foe lands a successful attack on the character, the character can spend a Fate Point to halve the damage dealt by the attack. Once a character defeats his sworn foe, he can name a new sworn foe at any time thereafter. A sworn foe must have at least equal HD or levels of experience than the character; if the character ever surpasses his sworn foe in level or HD, he must select a new foe. [Chosen]

**Tainted Blood:** See **inhumanity**.

**Taunt:** The character can taunt an intelligent creature (through word, gesture, or other action in lieu of attacking) in order to goad them into heedlessly berating or attacking the character in preference to all else. The taunted creature must be within 30’, be able to see or hear the character, and must succeed at a Spells saving throw with rage for 1d4 rounds plus 1 round per level of the character. In combat environments, hostile creatures who have been successfully taunted will heedlessly attack the character in preference to all others for the duration with disregard for their own safety, while in more social situations (such as at court), the creature’s reaction immediately turns unfriendly or hostile (if already unfriendly) and the creature will become verbally or possibly physically abusive to the character should the chance present itself. You might grant bonuses or penalties to the saving throw depending on circumstances, the temperament or natural inclinations of the creature, and/or their training (such as a diplomat in court possessing ranks in Diplomacy). The character can taunt a creature no more than once per hour. [Fool]

**Technological Jargon:** Technological jargon can be used to communicate with any other characters educated in the workings of technology, even if they do not share any common languages. A character can use technological jargon to communicate without error with any character who possesses the ability to perform ceremonies in the engineering tradition, or who possesses the ability to design, build, and repair automatons, or who possesses the ability to design and create constructs. Characters with Alien Lore, Engineering or Loremastery proficiencies may understand the character’s technological jargon with a successful proficiency throw. [Terran Engineer]

**Thievery Proficiency:**The character can select one class proficiency, choosing from Acrobatics, Alertness, Ambushing, Cat Burglary, Climbing, Contortionism, Eavesdropping, Lip Reading, Lockpicking, Passing Without Trace, Running, Skulking, and Trap Finding. This custom power can be selected multiple times, selecting an additional proficiency each time, to a maximum limit of three selections. [Chosen]

**Torment the Mind:** Once per day, the character can cast *dark whisper* with a casting time of 1 round. Creatures *bewitched* with other special abilities suffer a -4 penalty on saving throws against this effect. [Priestess of Nasga]

**Totem Animal:** The character can acquire a totem animal, following the procedures detailed in the shaman class. This power is a greatly modified version of the Familiar proficiency. Wizards call this **animal companion**. [Elven Wizard, Nobiran Wizard, Shaman, Wizard]

**Totem Benefit**: The character chooses a totem animal and receives a bonus proficiency related to the totem. The available animals and proficiencies received vary by class. For example, a lizardman cobra-warrior receives the Combat Reflexes proficiency for free. [Berserker, Lizardman Warrior, Shaman]

**Traditional Medicine):** The character can identify and forage for healing herbs as if he had one rank of Naturalism proficiency. (If he already has Naturalism, he gains a +4 bonus on proficiency throws to identify and forage for healing herbs.) He can use healing herbs as if he had Healing proficiency. Given one turn (10 minutes), he can combine a pound of healing herbs with an equal gp of special components to create potent healing herbs that increase their effect by +1. The character needs a cauldron over a fire or a kitchen to make potent healing herbs. The potent herbs lose all efficacy after 24 hours. [Antiquarian Witch]

**Treachery:** Anytime the character uses Diplomacy or Bribery to gain a Friendly reaction roll, he can force every creature (allied or enemy) within 30’ to make surprise rolls at a -3 penalty by treacherously attacking. Any creature that fails the roll is surprised for the first round of combat. If the venturer has some way of secretly signaling to his party (such as Signaling proficiency) or has planned the treachery to occur in advance, then his party does not have to make the surprise roll. The art of treachery cannot be used if the NPC opposition also has a character with this power handling negotiation, due to professional courtesy and mutual paranoia. [Venturer]

**Tribulating Adversary:**Whenever an enemy within 30’ makes an attack throw, proficiency throw, or saving throw, the character can spend a Fate Point to force the enemy to re-roll the throw. The character can spend additional Fate Points to allow further re-rolls if desired. However, the character can never force a re-roll of a natural 20. [Chosen]

**Unconquerable Soul:** The character gains a +1 bonus to all saving throws. If reduced to 0 hp or less, the character can choose to remain conscious and fight on, doing so for up to four rounds. If she fights on for one round, she suffers a -2 penalty on her eventual roll on the Mortal Wounds table. If she fights on for two rounds, the penalty is increased to -5. If she fights on for three rounds, the penalty is increased to -10. If she fights on for four rounds, she dies instantly at the end of the her initiative. [Dwarven Pugilist, Warmistress]

**Undead Slaying:** The character specializes in exterminating undead, receiving a +1 bonus to his attack throws against them. With a proficiency throw of 11+, he can identify the abilities and vulnerabilities of undead creatures based on their physical appearance or manifestation. [Dwarven Tombsealer]

**Underfoot:** Monsters of large size or more suffer a -2 penalty to their attack throws against the character. [Halflings]

**Unholy Fanaticism:** See **Holy Fervor**, above.

**Unliving:** The character is not a living being and thus it does not have to breathe. It also does not have to eat and drink except for healing purposes (see below). It is also immune to all forms of disease and poison including magical ones. *This custom power counts as 2 powers if selected.* [Revenant]

**Unveil Esoteric Meaning:** The gp value of the character’s library is doubled for purposes of magical research, and he is eligible for a bonus of up to +5 (instead of +3) from library value. [Nobiran Wizard, Zaharan Sorcerer]

**Utter Domination:** The character’s henchmen have base morale scores of +4 and no longer make loyalty rolls upon suffering calamities. (Unlike Command proficiency or Battlefield Prowess power, this power does not affect mercenaries). [Elven Cultist of Iskara, Zaharan Sorcerer]

**Village Wisdom:** The character can perform minor acts of “hedge magic” useful in village life, such as alleviating cold symptoms, easing the pains of childbirth, driving away bedbugs from a mattress, removing mites and ticks from a creature, and so on. Each use takes 1 turn (10 minutes). (If your Judge is using the optional rules for cantrips from ***AXIOMS****,* this class power grants the witch the ability to learn and cast divine cantrips instead.) [Witch]

**Weapon Systems Expert**: When using technological ranged weapons, the character can cleave as if he were twice his class level and can deals an extra die of damage on an attack throw scoring an unmodified 20. [Terran Starman]

**White Luck Presence:** Whenever a reaction roll is made in the presence of the character, the reaction is rolled twice and the better (or worse, character’s choice) roll is taken. *This custom power counts as 2 or more custom powers if selected,* [Fool]

**Wilderness Evasion:** When the character guides the party in familiar territory, the party gains a +5 bonus to proficiency throws to evade wilderness encounters. The character’s party can evade wilderness encounters even when surprised provided the explorer is not surprised. The character is considered familiar with the civilized areas of his starting region as well as all territory within one 24-mile hex radius of civilized areas. With each additional level of experience, the radius increases one 24-mile hex further from civilization. [Beastmaster, Explorer]

**Wisdom of the Ages:** A character who learns the wisdom of the ages gains insight into secrets of the past, the present, and the future that are hidden from all except the gods. In game terms, the character can cast *commune*once per week. Learning the wisdom of the ages, however, requires a terrible sacrifice – the character must either pluck out his own eye, chop off his own hand, slice off his own ears, or cut off his own nose. The injury must be self-inflicted, and if it is ever healed (through magic) the runemaker loses the wisdom of the ages irrevocably. *This power should only be used in heroic fantasy campaigns where commune requires ritual magic.* [Runemaker]

**Wholeness of Body:** The character becomes **immune** to mundane poisonous damage and automatically succeeds on saving throws against poisons with effects other than immediate death. He becomes **resistant** to extraordinary poisonous damage and gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against poisons with the effect of immediate death. [Chosen, Cultist of Lotan, Mystic]

**Widespread Renown:** See **battlefield prowess**.

**Words of Command and Obedience:** The character knows how to compel creatures to his inexorable will. Any creatures summoned by the character will obey him to the best of their ability rather than seek to pervert his intention. Any creatures he conjures will depart without harming him if his concentration is broken. [Warlock, Zaharan Sorcerer]

### Custom Drawbacks

Some classes have custom drawbacks that they select in order to have additional custom powers.

**Bound Waist:** The character has endured childhood waist-training and must wear a corset. The character suffers a -4 penalty to saving throws vs. gas effects. She can never force march (even if mounted) and must rest for 2 turns every 6 turns of activity. Tragically, the character’s weakened frame now needs the support of the corset and if she removes it for more than one turn (10 minutes) penalties ensue: She loses any **glamorous aura** or equivalent power, her STR is reduced by 2/3 for all purposes, and she cannot recover hit points from natural healing. *This custom drawback counts as -1 custom power.* [Priestess of Nasga]

**Dagger Nails:** The character has dagger-like nails. She may attack with her dagger nails in melee for 1d2, 1d4, or 1d6 points of damage. She can apply poison to her dagger nails as if they were weapons (and is not harmed by the poison, even if she scratches herself.) However, she suffers a -2, -4, or -6 penalty on any proficiency throws involving fine manipulation (the penalty is equal to the maximum damage she can deal with the nails). *This custom drawback counts as -1 custom power.* [Priestess of Nasga]

**Dark Soul:** The grim embrace of death holds special perils for the characters. Whenever the deceased character rolls on the Tampering with Mortality table, he suffers a penalty on the 1d20 roll of -1 per level of experience. *This custom drawback counts as -1 custom power.* [Zaharans]

**Dead Soul***:* The revenant is dead and cursed. It is beyond the capability of magic to return the character to life. The character cannot be brought back by *restore disfigurement and disability* or by *restore life & limb*. However, the character can be reanimated back into undead using an animate *undead* spell. After the spell is cast, roll on the Tampering with Mortality table with a -1 penalty on the 1d20 roll per level of experience. *This custom drawback counts as -1 custom power.* [Revenant]

**Discomfited by Civilization:** The sights, smells, and ways of cities are foreign and offensive to them. The character suffers a penalty to reaction rolls when in urban settlements equal to 7 minus the settlement’s market value. *This custom drawback counts as -1 custom power.* [Beastmaster]

**Easily Encumbered:** The character only has a normal load of 3 stone instead of 5 stone. When carrying 3 1/6 to 4 3/6 stone their speed is reduced by one-third. When carrying 4 4/6 to 6 stone, their speed is reduced by half. When carrying more than 6 st, their encounter speed is reduced by two-thirds. Round speeds to the nearest 30’. The character can carry a maximum of 12 stone, modified by their Strength bonus or penalty. *This custom drawback counts as -1 custom power. Note that this power interacts with Short-Statured to yield the encumbered speeds for halflings.* [Halflings]

**Reverse Healing:** Regular healing spells and **potions of healing** damage the character, while reverse healing spells (such as **harm**) heal it. *This custom drawback counts as -1 custom power.* [Revenant]

**Short-Statured:** The character is Small size and weighs only 4 st. He cannot use large weapons or ordinary shields and cannot use medium weapons one-handed. The character can fight with a small weapon and halfling-size shield, with a small weapon in each hand, or with a medium-sized weapon used two-handed. Because of his shorter stride, the character’s speed is reduced by 30’. *This custom drawback only counts as* *-1/2 custom power because Smal size can be advantageous in some circumstances.* [Halflings]*.*

**Unholy:** The character may be turned like any other undead of the same HD and is vulnerable to weapons and other effects (such as holy water) which harm the undead. However, their strength of will and the importance of their mission - which brought them back from the grave - allow them a save vs. death, with a +2 bonus, to escape the effects of turning. If this save fails, a "turned" result works like a fear spell; a "destroyed" result instantly slays the character; and a "controlled" result works as a charm effect. *This custom drawback counts as -2 custom powers.* [Revenant]

**Walk on Spikes:** The character has endured childhood foot-binding and can only walk in special shoes. Her wilderness movement rate is reduced by 1/2 and she must save vs. Paralysis or fall anytime she attempts to run or charge in uneven or broken terrain. Without special shoes, the character loses any **glamorous aura** or equivalent power, her movement rate is reduced to 30’, her DEX is reduced by 2/3 for AC purposes, and she must make a save vs. Paralysis or fall each round. The penalties do not apply if the character is mounted or flying. *This custom drawback counts as -1 custom power.* [Priestess of Nasga]

**Weak:** The character suffers a -4 penalty to proficiency throws to Dungeonbashing proficiency throws. *This custom drawback counts as -1 custom power. If combined with the -1 HD penalty, as with the Halfling racial value, reduce the XP value by another 500 XP.* [Halfling]
