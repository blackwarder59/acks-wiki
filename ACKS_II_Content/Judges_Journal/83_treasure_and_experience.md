## Treasure and Experience

After each foray, a party receives an amount of treasure and experience determined by the number of encounters defeated and the level of the dungeon. A party that fails to fully clear the dungeon receives only one-quarter the indicated amount of treasure, but full experience for the encounters they defeated.

Consult the Treasure and Experience by Dungeon Level table for the amount of treasure and experience gained per defeated encounter. The total number of encounters defeated should be counted up as forays are resolved, with a running total of gold and XP earned thus far kept. The final calculation of treasure and experience earned should be done only when the party chooses to withdraw entirely or fully clears the dungeon.

### Magic Items

Parties that fully clear a dungeon may find magical items as well as gold. Each dungeon level has a varying chance of items being present as well as variable amount of items found. The Magical Items table, below, shows how often to roll and which treasure type to roll as. In all cases, the mechanic is to roll for magical items per X full gold pieces found. When rolling for magic items, use the treasure type only to roll for magical items; do not roll for gold, gems, jewelry, or anything else. (Everything with a GP value is abstracted into the amount of gold found already.)

### Allocating Treasure and XP

If the adventuring party is PCs, or NPCs acting on their own behalf, they retain all earned treasure and experience and gain experience from treasure found as normal. If the adventuring party is henchmen or followers, their employer gains no combat XP, and the henchmen or followers receive half combat XP. The henchmen or followers receive half of all loot found (gaining XP from retained loot as normal), with the other half going to the employer, for whom it is treated as campaign XP (affected by GP threshold mechanics as normal).
