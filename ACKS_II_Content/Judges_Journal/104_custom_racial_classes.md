## Custom Racial Classes

Custom racial classes are built using a similar system, with minor differences to reflect the race’s unique capabilities.

### Racial Class Category

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Build**  **Points** | **Level**  **Limit** |
| 8 | 8 |
| 7 | 10 |
| 6 | 11 |
| 5 | 12 |
| 4 | 13 |

The most important aspect of a racial class is that it has a **racial value** which gives special powers unique to that race. A racial custom class can allocate as many as 4 *extra* build points to its racial class category, for a total of *8 build points*. A racial class can still only spend a maximum of 4 build points on the Hit Dice, Fighting, Thievery, Divine, and Arcane categories, and it must expend at least 4 total build points across all its values. A racial custom class will have a maximum level between 8 and 13 determined by how many total build points the custom class uses, as noted on the accompanying table.

### Requirements

A race will impose one or more additional requirements on its custom classes. For example, all dwarven classes require Constitution 9 or better. All elven classes require Intellect 9 or better. If, for instance, an elven custom class also has Intellect as a key attribute then this requirement is moot, of course.

### Class Category Values

Certain races may receive slightly different benefits or penalties at different point values. Certain races may pay more or less XP for different point values.

### Racial Value

The class’s racial value will determine its racial custom powers. These may include both general abilities such as seeing in the dark, as well as class-like abilities such as casting spells. Assigning a Racial Value of 0 will generally provide the race’s general abilities, while a higher allocation will yield class-like abilities or additions or expansions on the race’s abilities.

### Saving Throws

Racial classes save as fighters, mages, thieves, or crusaders. However, each race will modify the saving throws based on its strengths and weaknesses, determined by its Racial Value.

Apart from any innate modifiers it might provide, the Racial Value is *not* used for purposes of determining a demi-human class’s saving throws, even when the Racial Value stacks with one of the Class Category Values.

EXAMPLE: The standard elven spellsword was built with Hit Dice Value 1, Fighting Value 2, Elf Value 4. The elven spellsword uses the saving throw progression for Fighters, even though the class spent the most build points in the Elf category.

Note that the elven spellswords and nightblade and dwarven craftpriest and vaultguard saving throw tables in the ***ACKS II***rulebook are simply the saving throw progressions for their respective underlying class progression, modified by their respective race’s adjustments.

### Magic Items

A racial value that stacks with one of the class category values will provide access to magic items useable by the class category if a combined value of at least 2 is assigned.

EXAMPLE: The standard elven spellsword was built with Hit Dice Value 1, Fighting Value 2, Elf Value 4. The class uses the saving throw progression for fighters, so it can use magical items restricted to fighters. The class can also use magic items restricted to mages, because Elf Value stacks with Arcane Value, and it has a combined value of at least 2 in Arcane + Elf.

### Strongholds

A racial value that stacks with one of the class category values will provide access to strongholds of the type appropriate to the class category if a combined value sufficient to meet the threshold is assigned. Some racial values also provide access to unique racial strongholds.

EXAMPLE: The standard elven spellsword was built with Hit Dice Value 1, Fighting Value 2, Arcane Value 1, Elf Value 3. The elven spellsword qualified for either a Castle, Sanctum, or Elven Fastness type stronghold. We chose Elven Fastness.

### Hit Points per Level after 9th

Some races will gain additional hit points per level after 9th in addition to those provided by their saving throw progression.

### Experience Point Progression After 8th level

Some races will increase the amount of experience required to gain each level after 8th.
