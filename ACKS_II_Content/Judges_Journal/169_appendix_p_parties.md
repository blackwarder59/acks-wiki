# Appendix P: Parties

One of the more time-consuming requirements of monster encounters can be creating NPC adventuring parties. In this appendix, we present a number of parties of adventurers for your use. All of these adventurers were commissioned by high-tier backers of the ***ACKS Imperial Imprint,*** to whom we owe our great gratitude. The entries focus on the information that will be most useful to you in using them as allies, foes, or foils of your own adventurers.

Equipment is presented in the following order: primary weapon, secondary weapon(s), shield, armor, helmet, worn or slung magic items, belt pouch, pouched magic items, pouched adventuring equipment, backpack, packed magic items, packed adventuring equipment, purse (coins). NPCs with mounts typically carry non-essential equipment (e.g. blankets) in their mountsâ€™ saddlebags. All mounts are riding mounts unless otherwise noted. ML modifiers only apply when the party members are used as NPCs, not as PCs.
