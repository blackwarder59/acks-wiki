# Chapter 15: Custom Magic Types

In ***ACKS II***, we presented just two types of magic: **divine magic** and **arcane magic**. All of the spellcasting character classes use one or both of these types of magic. The two types of characters represent the most common and popular archetypes of myth, legend, film, and literature. However, they also incorporate certain assumptions that might not be appropriate for every setting. For instance, in a setting similar to Robert E. Howard’s Hyboria, you might want sorcery-wielding priests who can heal and animate the dead, but learn their spells through study like mages.

The rules that follow enable Judges to create new **magic types** with different characteristics that can be used with the *Players’ Companion* to create very different spellcasting classes. To create a new type of magic, follow these ten steps:

1. Develop a name and concept for the new magic type. Is it an art of illusions and dweomers, such as appears in fairy tales? Perhaps it is a sinister sorcery devoted to mind-control and summoning. The concept should drive your choices in the remaining steps.
2. Set the magic type’s **source factors** for each of the 11 spell types. No source factor can be less than 1 or greater than 2.25, and the sum of all source factors must be at least 11 and no more than 15. See **Source Factors** section.
3. Use the magic type’s source factors to calculate the magic type’s **Base XP Cost**. See the **Source Factors** section.
4. Choose a spell progression for the magic type. Spells progressions can be standard (mage), alternative (crusader), or improved. Adjust the Base XP Cost as directed. See the **Spell Progression** section.
5. Determine how the magic type acquires its spell repertoire, through **prayer**, **study**, or **inheritance**. See the **Spell Repertoire** section.
6. Decide whether the magic type carries a **code of behavior**. See the **Codes of Behavior** section.
7. Use the Base XP Cost and spell progression to create the magic type’s **class category value**. This class category value will be used when making custom classes that use the magic type. See the **Magic Type Class Category** section.
8. Choose the methods of **magic research** open to the magic type’s classes. See the **Magic Research** section.
9. Determine what **saving throw progression** the magic type’s class category value results in. See the **Saving Throw Progression** section.
10. Create a spell list for your new magic type. This spell list will serve as the basis from which studious and inherited casters of the new type learn spells, or from which prayerful caster classes select their repertoire.

Once these ten steps are complete, the new magic type is ready for use in your custom classes.
