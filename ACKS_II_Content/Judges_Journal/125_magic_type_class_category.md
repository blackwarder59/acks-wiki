## Magic Type Class Category

In order to use a new magic type in play, it will need to be incorporated into one or more custom character classes. As explained in the prior chapter*,* creating a custom class is a process of allocating **build points** to various **class categories** that define the strengths and weaknesses of the class. The Divine and Arcane magic types each have their own class category, and any new magic type must have its own class category value as well. When building a custom class, each class category is allocated between 0 and 4 build points. When more build points are allocated to the class category, more abilities from within that class category are available, and more XP are required to advance in level.

At each build point (1-4), the magic type’s spell progression and Base XP Cost is modified upward or downward. As such, different class categories can be more or less powerful and expensive depending on the underlying magic type’s Base XP Cost. For example, assigning 2 build points to the Divine value allows a character class to cast spells at the full power of the character’s actual level, at a cost of 500 XP. Assigning 2 build points to the Arcane value allows a character class to cast spells at about half the characters’ actual level, at a cost of 1,250 XP. This 500% variance is because the Arcane magic type has a Base XP Cost of 2,500 while the Divine magic type has a Base XP Cost of 500.

To determine the XP Cost and rate of spell progression at each build point, find the magic type’s Base XP Cost on the Class Category Value table below. Multiply the Base XP Cost by the XP Cost Multiplier at each level. Apply the effects noted on the Spell Progression column to the magic type’s spell progression (alternative, improved, or standard), as explained below.

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Class**  **Category**  **Value** | **2000+ Base XP Cost** | | **1,999 – 1,000 Base XP Cost** | | **999 – 500 Base XP Cost** | |
| **Spell Progression** | **XP Cost Multiplier** | **Spell Progression** | **XP Cost Multiplier** | **Spell Progression** | **XP Cost Multiplier** |
| 4 | 100% Power | x1 | 133% Power | x2 | 150% Power | x4 |
| 3 | 66% Power | x0.75 | 100% Power | x1 | 133% Power | x2 |
| 2 | 50% Power | x0.5 | 75% Power | x0.75 | 100% Power | x1 |
| 1 | 33% Power | x0.25 | 40% Level | x0.4 | 50% Power | 0.5 |
| 0 | None | 0 | None | 0 | None | 0 |

**33% Power:** The class has the ability to cast spells and engage in magic research (see below) with approximately 33% of the power of its class level according to its spell progression. The class uses its effective caster level for purposes of level-dependent spell ranges, duration, and damage. If the magic type is prayerful, its repertoire is decreased to 1/3 the normal allocation (rounded up).

**40% Power:** The class has the ability to cast spells and engage in magic research with approximately 40% of the power of its class level according to its spell progression. The class uses its effective caster level for purposes of level-dependent spell ranges, duration, and damage. If the magic type is prayerful, its repertoire is decreased to 1/3 the normal allocation (rounded up).

**50% Power:** The class has the ability to cast spells and engage in magic research with approximately 50% of the power of its class level according to its spell progression. The class uses its effective caster level for purposes of level-dependent spell ranges, duration, and damage If the magic type is prayerful, its repertoire is decreased to 1/2 the normal allocation (rounded up).

**66% Power:** The class has the ability to casts spells and engage in magical research with approximately 66% of the power of its class level according to its spell progression. The class uses its effective caster level for purposes of level-dependent spell ranges, durations, and damage. If the magic type is prayerful, its repertoire is decreased to 1/2 the normal allocation (rounded up).

**75% Power:** The class has the ability to cast spells and engage in magical research with approximately 75% of the power of its class level according to its spell progression. The class uses its effective caster level for purposes of level-dependent spell ranges, duration, and damage. If the magic type is prayerful, its repertoire is decreased to 3/4 the normal allocation (rounded up).

**100% Power:** The class has the ability to cast spells and engage in magical research at its class level according its spell progression.

**133% Power:** The class has the ability to cast spells and engage in magical research at its class level according to its spell progression. However, increase the class’s spells per level by 33%. Round fractions of .5 or greater up. The class uses its class level for all level-dependent spell ranges, durations, and damages; these are not increased by 33%. A class using the Alternative progression with Spells x 150% can cast one 1st level spell per day at 1st level. If the magic type is prayerful, its repertoire is increased by 20% above the normal allocation.

**150% Power:** The class has the ability to cast spells at its class level according to its spell progression. However, increase the class’s spells per level by 50%. Round fractions of .5 or greater up. The class uses its class level for all level-dependent spell ranges, durations, and damages; these are not increased by 50%. A class using the Alternative progression with Spells x 150% can cast one 1st level spell per day at 1st level. If the magic type is prayerful, its repertoire is increased by 50% above the normal allocation.

EXAMPLE: Below are three completed Class Category tables. The first table is for the Arcane magic type, the second table is for the Faery magic type, and the third table is for the Divine magic type.

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Class**  **Category**  **Value** | **Arcane (Base XP Cost 2,500)** | | **Faery (Base XP Cost 1,500)** | | **Divine (Base XP Cost 500)** | |
| **Spell**  **Progression** | **XP**  **Cost** | **Spell**  **Progression** | **XP**  **Cost** | **Spell**  **Progression** | **XP**  **Cost** |
| 4 | 100% Standard | 2,500 | 133% Alternative | 3,000 | 150% Standard | 2,000 |
| 3 | 66% Standard | 1,875 | 100% Alternative | 1,500 | 133% Standard | 1,000 |
| 2 | 50% Standard | 1,250 | 75% Alternative | 1,125 | 100% Standard | 500 |
| 1 | 33% Standard | 625 | 50% Alternative | 560 | 50% Standard | 250 |
| 0 | None | 0 | None | 0 | None | 0 |

###### Adding Class Powers

A class category can provide one or more class powers at some or all of its class category values. Each class power costs 75 XP. Add the cost of the class powers to the final XP cost of the class category at each class category value. A magic type class category can provide a maximum of one class power per point of class category value.

The specific class powers offered can be defined in advance for the class category, or left as “open slots” to be filled with class-specific powers.

EXAMPLE: The Judge decides he wants the Faery class category to offer a variety of class powers which can be used on a variety of spell-like abilities. He decides the class category will offer the maximum number of powers – 4 at class category value 4, 3 at class category value 3, 2 at class category value 2, and 1 at class category value 1. This raises the cost of the class category. Class category value 4 now costs [3,000 + (75 x 4)] 3,300 XP. Class category value 3 now costs [1,500 + (75 x 3)] 1,725 XP. Class category value 2 now costs [1,125 + (75 x 2)] 1,275 XP. Class category value 1 now costs (560 + 75) 635 XP.
