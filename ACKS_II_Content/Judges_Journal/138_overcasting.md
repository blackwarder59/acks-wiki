## Overcasting

In some settings, spellcasters can push themselves beyond the ordinary limits of magic, accomplishing more than is normally possible – albeit at great risk. Use these rules if you want magic-users to be more powerful and unpredictable.

### Overview

Casters of Arcane and Divine magic can attempt to Overcast extra spells beyond those they are allotted each day. Each time that a spell is Overcast, however, the player must roll a d20 and consult the Overcasting Success table. Failure results in a fumble. Throwing an unmodified 20 results in an automatic Overcasting Success. Throwing an unmodified 1 is an automatic failure.

Subsequent attempts to Overcast require successively higher throws to succeed. The Overcasting Success throw is reset each time the caster meets his studious or prayerful requirements.

EXAMPLE: A 1st-level mage can normally cast one 1st-level spell per day. If she elects to Overcast a second 1st-level spell on the same day before resting, she fumbles the spell on a throw of 1-5. A third spell cast through Overcasting before resting will result in a fumble on a d20 throw of 1-10.

A caster cannot Overcast spells of a level to which he does not already have access. However, custom classes built with the alternative spell progression table (who cannot cast spells at 1st level), can Overcast 1st-level spells, even though they do not normally have access to spellcasting until 2nd-level. Doing so is considered the first Overcast of the day and requires an Overcasting Success throw of 6+.

A caster can choose to spend double the time Overcasting a spell in order to gain a bonus of +2 to the Overcasting Success throw. In most cases, this means taking two rounds to Overcast a spell. The player must indicate that he is taking double the casting time when the casting of the spell is declared. Note that if the character takes damage or fails a saving throw at any time during the Overcast before the spell goes off, the spell is lost. In this case, no success throw is made, but it does count as an attempt.

| **Overcasting Success** | | |
| Attempt of the Day | Throw | Throw w/ Double Time |
| 1st | 6+ | 4+ |
| 2nd | 11+ | 9+ |
| 3rd | 16+ | 14+ |
| 4th | 20+ | 18+ |

### Arcane Calamity

When a caster of arcane magic fumbles due to Overcasting, he must roll d% on the Arcane Calamity table. A calamity represents a mistake of some kind. Perhaps the caster mispronounced a magical syllable, or waggled his fingers the wrong way. The caster might also have let his guard down, allowing the extra-planar creature he had bound to his will to gain the upper hand.

### Divine Transgression

When a caster of divine magic fumbles due to Overcasting, he must roll d% on the Divine Transgression table. The transgression might be that he misspoke a prayer or performed a holy ritual incorrectly. The caster’s deity, or their intercessor, might decide to teach them a lesson. It might just be a rough day in the Spheres of Existence. The gods are fickle, callous, and pernicious, and they and their representatives sometimes care little for the travails of mere mortals.

### Axioms Tables

The Arcane Calamity and Divine Transgression tables presented in ***ACKS II***have been modified from their original tables published in ***AXIOMS Issue 1****.* While the odds of a negative outcome are identical on both tables, the original ***AXIOMS***tables have a wider variety of effects, many of which could permanently change the campaign setting by e.g. creating places of power, altering the weather, inflicting a plague, and so on. These results could be very exciting, but they made some Judges reluctant to introduce overcasting into their campaigns because they did not want low-level casters to be able to have such a powerful impact when they screwed up. However, if you prefer your magic to be wild, powerful, and strange, the tables found in ***AXIOMS Issue 1***are fully compatible with ***ACKS II****.*

### Additional Rules

The following additional rules are included to provide the Judge with additional ways to augment Overcasting for her campaign.

#### Calamity and Disfavor

The Judge should feel free to use the Arcane Calamity and Divine Transgression tables for appropriate situations other than Overcasting. For example, if a Cleric does something particularly offensive in the eyes of his deity, perhaps a roll on the Divine Transgression table is in order.

#### Power and Risk

Some Judges might prefer that the risk of Overcasting should increase with the power of the spell being attempted. This is so that the Overcasting of higher-level spells becomes relatively more dangerous. In this case, add the level of the spell to the Overcasting Success throw number needed to avoid a fumble or, alternatively, add the level of the spell to the roll on the Arcane Calamity and Divine Disfavor tables.

#### Proficiencies

At the Judge’s discretion, the following Class Proficiencies become available to Arcane and Divine casters. Players who elect to use any of these proficiencies must substitute each one taken for an existing class proficiency, permanently losing access to the replaced proficiency.

###### Careful Overcaster

When taking double the amount of time to Overcast a spell, the character gains a bonus of +4 to the Overcasting Success throw, instead of the normal +2 bonus.

###### Master Overcaster

The character gains a +1 to all Overcasting Success throws. This proficiency may be taken only once.
