The Thievery Value determines the class’s access to thief skills. Assign 0 to 4 build points to the class’s Thievery Value. Then note down the appropriate skill choices and the XP cost.

There are thirteen thief skills available: (1) Backstabbing, (2) Climbing, (3) Deciphering, (4) Hiding), (5) Listening, (6) Lockpicking, (7) Pickpocketing, (8) Searching, (9) Scrollreading, (10) Shadowy Senses, (11) Sneaking, (12) Trapbreaking, (13) Jack of All Trades. Backstabbing counts as two skills.

### Thievery Value Trade-Offs

**Custom Power Trade-Off:** A class may choose trade one or more thief skills for one custom power each. Custom powers are explained in detail later in these rules. In general, custom powers include any class proficiency, any general proficiency, or single non-spell casting power possessed by any character class. You can limit particular combinations of custom powers at his discretion to maintain game balance.

EXAMPLE: The standard explorerhas a Thievery Value of 1. The explorer traded all of its thief skills to acquire four custom powers (Alertness, Ambushing, Evasion, Natural Stealth).

**Level Lock Trade-Off:** A class may trade one or more initial thief skills for skills or custom powers unlocked at a higher level. In general, one skill at 1st level can be given up for two skills unlocked at a higher level. See the **Custom Power Trade-Offs** section for more details.

EXAMPLE: The standard thief has a Thievery Value of 3, granting it 12 thief skills. The standard thief selected Backstabbing (counts as 2 skills), Climbing, Hiding, Listening, Lockpicking, Pickpocketing, Searching, Shadowy Senses, Sneaking, and Trapbreaking. The standard thief then exchanged its final skill selection for Decipher at 4th level and Scrollreading at 10th level.

### Limitations on Thief Skill Usage

Regardless of a class’s Fighting Value, certain thief skills require that the character be in leather armor or lighter and be free of a shield. The skills are: Backstabbing, Hiding, Pickpocketing, and Sneaking

EXAMPLE: The standard assassin has a Thievery Value of 1. This makes the class eligible for four thief skills. The assassin chose Backstabbing, Hiding, and Sneaking. Although the standard assassin is proficient in medium armor, these skills can only be used when the assassin is wearing leather armor or lighter and free of a shield.

At your discretion, other custom powers may also be limited to characters in leather armor or lighter, or have other requirements he deems necessary for balance.
