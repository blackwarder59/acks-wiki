## Divine Value

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Value** | **Divine** | **XP Cost** |
| 4 | 150% Power | 2,000 |
| 3 | 133% Power | 1,000 |
| 2 | 100% Power | 500 |
| 1 | 50% Power | 250 |
| 0 | No Divine Spellcasting | 0 |

The Divine Value determines the extent of the class’s divine spellcasting abilities, if any. Assign 0 to 4 build points to the class’s Divine Value, noting down the appropriate powers and the XP cost.

**Divine 1:** A Divine Value of 1 gives the class the ability to rebuke undead, casts spells, and engage in magical research like a crusader, but at a diminished effective caster level relative to class level. The class uses its effective caster level for purposes of level-dependent spell ranges, durations, and damage. The class’s divine spell repertoire is based on a spell list of 5 spells per level.

**Divine 2:** A Divine Value of 2 points gives the class the ability to rebuke undead, cast spells, and engage in magical research as a crusader. The class’s divine spell repertoire is based on a spell list of 10 spells per level.

**Divine 3:** A Divine Value of 3 gives the class the ability to rebuke undead and cast spells as a crusader but with the class’s spells per level increased by 33%. The class uses its class level for all level-dependent spell ranges, durations, and damages; these are not increased. The class’s divine spell repertoire is based on a spell list of 12 spells per level.

**Divine 4:** A Divine Value of 4 gives the class the ability to rebuke undead and cast spells as a crusader, but with the class’s spells per level increased by 50%. The class uses its class level for all level-dependent spell ranges, durations, and damages. The class’s divine spell repertoire is based on a spell list of 15 spells per level.

When creating a custom class with divine spellcasting abilities, be sure to build a spell repertoire appropriate to the class. Select from 5-15 divine spells from the Divine Spell List in *ACKS Imperial Imprint*. The spells selected should reflect the flavor of the class and be balanced relative to other similar classes.

### Divine Value Codes

All custom classes with a Divine Value of 1 or more must have a code of behavior. The higher the Divine Value, the more restrictive the behavior code will be.

**Divine 1:** The class’s code will be similar to the commandments on a lay member of a religious faith, such as not to commit adultery, to follow minor dietary restrictions, and to engage in prayer on worship days, etc. A knight’s chivalric vows would also qualify.

**Divine 2:** The code will add additional rules to an extent similar to that imposed on clergy, such as monogamy or celibacy, restrictions on dress, bans on certain indulgences, strict dietary rules, daily prayer, etc. The bladedancer, crusader, dwarven craftpriest, and shaman have such codes.

**Divine 3:** The code will require a highly restrictive set of behaviors akin to those of a monastic order, including vows of chastity, obedience, and so on.

**Divine 4:** The class’s code will be similar to that of Divine Value 3, but with an additional restriction such as pacifism, silence, or poverty. The priestess class has such a code.

A code of behavior need not demand virtue – a class’s code could dictate strange or vile behavior if appropriate to the class’s concept. For example, a cultist class devoted to chaotic powers might require ritual sacrifices, or use of strange drugs. You, as Judge, are the ultimate authority on the permissibility of any class’s code.

### Divine Value Trade-Offs

A custom class with a Divine Value of 1 or more may voluntarily trade off its ability to rebuke undead in exchange for custom powers. The custom class gains 1 custom power for every point allocated to Divine Value.

A class which trades off its ability to rebuke undead loses the ability to perform necromantic research at 11th level.

**Level Lock Trade-Off:** A selection of custom powers received from a Divine Value trade-off may be exchanged for a larger selection at a higher level of experience. See the **Custom Power Trade-Offs** section for more details.

EXAMPLE: The shaman class has a Divine Value of 2. The shaman class traded off its ability to rebuke undead in exchange for 2 custom powers. It then exchanged these 2 custom powers for a selection of 3 custom powers at 3rd, 5th, and 7th level.
