## The Basics of Realm Building

The mechanics of domains and realms described in ***ACKS II***are designed to create a very particular pattern, where realms of certain sizes are ruled by rulers of particular experience levels, resulting in a hierarchy where high-level NPCs ruling vast empires through vassals in several layers that terminate in low-level NPC barons ruling small domains.

The two tables below show how this pattern works. The **Realms by Type** table shows a number of different types of realms, ranging from lowly baronies to huge empires. For each type of realm, the table provides the realm ruler’s expected level, the realm’s population in families, the number of individual domains in the realm, and the size of the realm in square miles, 6-mile hexes, and 24-mile hexes. (Note that this data corresponds with the tiers shown in **Tiers by Realm Size** table in the **Strongholds and Domains** rules in Chapter 8 of ***ACKS II RR***). The **Political Divisions of Realms** table shows how many vassal realms of each type exist within a larger realm. If desired, each of these vassal realm can, in turn, be described using the Realms by Type table.

There are several mechanical reasons why this pattern occurs in *ACKS.* The first and most important reason is the game’s unique **monthly XP threshold** mechanic. The monthly XP threshold is in many ways the “secret sauce” that powers *ACKS* campaign play. When a ruler rules a domain or realm, he gains campaign XP for income over his monthly XP threshold, which causes him to advance in level. However, as the ruler advances in level, his monthly XP threshold increases. Therefore, the character will gain fewer and fewer XP from his rulership as he advances in level, until eventually he reaches a plateau beyond which he cannot advance without enlarging his realm. Low-level characters who end up in control of powerful realms either level up quickly or end up removed from power by vassals who’d like to level up. In either case, the “appropriate” level of ruler ends up in charge.

The second reason that this pattern is certain to occur is the game’s **personal authority** mechanic. The personal authority mechanic modifies domain morale based on the ruler’s experience level relative to the amount of income his domain generates. While a high-level ruler can control a large and wealthy domain, if he attempts to despotically dominate a vast territory without allocating some of it to vassals, he will find his domain morale is harshly penalized. Such domains suffer exactly the sort of rebellions and unrest that make it possible for ambitious rulers of lesser domains to conquer them. The personal authority mechanic makes it inevitable that large realms transform into a series of vassal realms run by governors, proconsuls, satraps, etc.

The third reason for the pattern’s recurrence is the **tribute inefficiency** mechanic. The tribute inefficiency mechanic imposes a financial penalty on rulers who attempt to extract tribute from more than eight different vassals. It thus has the opposite effect of the personal authority mechanic. The former mechanics causes realms to be divided up among vassals; this mechanic prevents realms from being divided up between too many vassals.

The final reason for the pattern’s inevitable occurrence is the **non-henchman vassal** mechanic. Every ruler has only a limited number of available henchmen, which he must allocate to duties such as bodyguard, military commander, magistrate, and vassal ruler. Realms which are divided into too many vassal domains force the ruler to rely on non-henchman vassals, who are untrustworthy and prone to rebel. Like the tribute inefficiency mechanic, the non-henchman vassal mechanic prevents realms from being divided up too much.

These four mechanics work in tandem such that the optimal way to structure a domain is to structure it in something very much like the pattern described in the tables above. In short, *ACKS* creates an “efficient market for experience points” where each ruler, in order to maximize his own personal accumulation of XP, is guided by the ‘invisible hand’ of the game mechanics to create realms structured just like those in the tables above.

Of course, just as in real-world markets, such patterns really only represent long-term tendencies. In the short term, there will always be some realms that are inefficiently structured, some realms whose ruler has recently died and left behind a weak or inadequate heir, some realms run by adventurers more powerful than their title would suggest, and so on. Such variations from the pattern create just the sort of opportunities for conquest that *ACKS* players need! Indeed, the activities of the player characters can be understood as being the very market forces that create the optimal pattern.

With those fundamentals in mind, let’s build the realms in your sandbox.
