# Chapter 2: Adventures

At its core, ***ACKS II***is a game of high adventure in which your player characters will explore dangerous and distant places, fated either to perish at the hands of terrible perils or to overcome the odds and return laden with treasure. A great adventure, one that takes advantage of the full breadth and depth of ***ACKS II***â€™s mechanics, will be a challenge to both the players and the Judge. The rules in this chapter will help you meet that challenge. They serve to supplement and expand the rules presented in Chapters 6 and 7 of the ***ACKS II Revised Rulebook***.
