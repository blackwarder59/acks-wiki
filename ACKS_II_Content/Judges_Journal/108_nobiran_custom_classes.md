## Nobiran Custom Classes

Nobiran is a classical Auran term meaning “descended from the gods”; and a Nobirus is one such descendant (the plural is Nobir). The original Nobir were the heroes of the Empyrean War, kings and prophets granted epic power by the gods. Though these bloodlines have faded with the passing of time, occasionally a child is still born with some measure of the old gifts, superior to normal humans in nobility of spirit and strength of body. Nobiran appearance can vary depending on ethnicity, but they are always tall, well-built, and proud featured.

Outside of the Auran Empire campaign setting, Nobir could be used to model any demi-human race of exceptional power and nobility, such as the half-human, half-divine demigods of Greek myth, the Aasimar of the Forgotten Realms, or the Dúnedainof Tolkien’s Middle Earth.

Nobiran character classes are created using the Nobirus racial category and experience points. Requirements, class category values, hit points per level after 9th, and experience point progressions are modified as noted below.

### Requirements

All Nobiran classes require a minimum 11 or better in *all* ability scores. Those who truly embody the epic heroes of old must be above average in every respect.

### Class Category Values

**Divine:** Nobirans can never allocate build points to the Divine category. However, the Nobirus value functions as a substitute for it.

### Nobirus Value

When building a Nobirus custom class, assign between 0 and 4 build points to the class’s Nobirus Value. At Nobirus 0, all Nobirus gain the following Nobirus custom powers:

* **Blood of Kings:** The blood of ancient kings and heroes flows in every Nobirus. The character may hire one more henchman than his Charisma would otherwise permit, and the base morale score of any henchmen is increased by 1.
* **Favor of the Empyrean Powers:** As the favored of the Empyrean powers, all Nobirus characters receive a +2 bonus to all saving throws.
* **Heroic Spirit:** Because of their courageous spirit, the maximum class level for any Nobirus class is increased by 1.
* **Longeval:** All Nobiran characters are ageless and enjoys a lifespan three times longer than normal. They are immune to diseases caused by undead and gains a +1 bonus to their HD rolls at 1st level.

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Value** | **Nobirus** | **XP Cost** |
| 4 | Nobirus + Crusader (Spells x 150%) | 2125 |
| 3 | Nobirus + Crusader (Spells x 133%) | 1125 |
| 2 | Nobirus + Crusader | 625 |
| 1 | Nobirus + Reduced Crusader | 375 |
| 0 | Nobirus | 125 |

Additional points allocated to the Nobirus Value offer divine spellcasting abilities, including the ability to rebuke undead, identical to those of the Divine Value with the same score. Remember that Nobirans cannot take the Divine Value; if they want divine spells, they gain them through the Nobiran value.

EXAMPLE #1: A Nobiran custom class has Hit Dice 2, Fighting 2, and Nobirus 2. The class has HD and fighting ability of a fighter combined with the spellcasting and rebuking of a crusader. He requires 2,625 XP to advance to 2nd level.

Remember that, like other demi-humans, a Nobirus may still only spend a maximum of 4 build points on the Hit Dice, Fighting, Thievery, and Arcane categories in total.

EXAMPLE: A Nobiran custom class has Hit Dice 2, Arcane 3, and Nobirus 1. Adding the build points spent on Hit Dice and Arcane (2+3) yields 5. This is above the maximum permitted of 4, so the class must be modified.

### Experience Point Progression After 8th level

Nobir increase the amount of experience required to gain each level after 8th by 40,000XP.
