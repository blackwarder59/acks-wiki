## Step 4: Determine Sub-Vassal Realm Types

Returning to the Political Divisions of Realms table, we see that a typical Duchy has 4 to 6 Counties beneath it. In sub-steps 7(b)(i) and 7(b)(iv) in the last chapter, you placed a total of 17 to 26 strongholds. (You might have one less if you used one of your strongholds to replace an independent city-state or vault.) Each of those strongholds is ruled by a Count of 7th to 8th level who controls a County of 15 to 30 6-mile hexes as vassal to one of the Dukes. Assign the individual strongholds to the Dukes such that each Duke has between 4 and 6 Counts beneath him. Don’t worry about rulers below the level of Count at this stage.

In the Auran Empire campaign setting, Counties are called “Legatures” and ruled by Legates. Recall that last chapter we placed 13 strongholds in 7(b)(i) and 8 strongholds in step 7(b)(iv); that’s 21 strongholds in total. One of those forts, however, we used in Step 3 above to replace Azen Radokh as the seat of power for a Duchy. Therefore we have 20 strongholds remaining. We assign 5 strongholds to each of the 4 Palatines. Thus, each Palatine has 5 Legates as vassals, each ruling Legatures around their strongholds.
