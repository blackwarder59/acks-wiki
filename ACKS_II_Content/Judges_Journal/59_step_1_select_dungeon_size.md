## Step 1: Select Dungeon Size

First, you must decide the size of the dungeon you are creating. In Chapter 5, we defined the following dungeon size:

* A **megadungeon** has hundreds of rooms spread across a number of levels.
* A **large dungeon** has 60 to 120 rooms spread across one to three levels.
* A **standard dungeon** has 15 to 25 rooms spread across one or two levels.
* A **small dungeon** has 2 to 10 rooms, usually on one level.
* A **lair** might range from a den in a tree to a village but it is characterized by featuring one type of monster in its native habitat.

If you’ve taken our advice on constructing your sandbox, your setting will have 3 large dungeons, 14 to 20 standard dungeons, and 9 to 13 small dungeons or lairs. If this is the first *ACKS* dungeon you’re creating, we recommend a single-level standard dungeon with about 25 rooms. That’s enough size to get a “feel” for the system without it being overwhelming. Maps of this size are also readily available online if you want to avoid having to try your hand at cartography.
