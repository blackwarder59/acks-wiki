## After the Foray

Each foray requires one day of strenuous dedicated activity. The party might need additional rest if it has suffered casualties. After the foray is resolved, if the dungeon is not fully cleared, additional monsters might arrive in the interim before the next foray. For each full day that passes until the next foray, roll the listed die for the dungeon size on the Dungeon Restocking table. Add the result to the number of encounters remaining in the dungeon, up to the maximum of the original number of encounters in the dungeon. A roll of zero (or less) indicates that no new monsters arrived after that foray.

EXAMPLE: A party has undertaken an expedition to a medium dungeon that had five encounters originally. In their first foray, they cleared three encounters, leaving two remaining. They are called away to handle domain matters, returning for another foray three days later. Since three days have passed, the Judge rolls 2d3-4 three times. The first roll is 0, the second roll is a 1, and the third roll is a -2 (rounded to 0). Therefore the number of encounters in the dungeon increases from two to three.

| **Dungeon Restocking** | |
| **Dungeon Size** | **Encounters Restocked** |
| Small | 1d3-2 |
| Medium | 2d3-4 |
| Large | 2d6-7 |
| Mega | 2d12-13 |

Encounters that arrive as a result of restocking grant combat experience as normal, but carry no treasure; ignore the Treasure result of the resolution roll and consider it to be 0 for any restocked encounter.
