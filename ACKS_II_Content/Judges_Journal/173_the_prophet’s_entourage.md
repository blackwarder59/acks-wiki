## The Prophet’s Entourage

The power of faith compels the prophet Alanyi Bin Deri and his entourage to undertake a desperate struggle to prevent the terrible fate Alanyi has foreseen in the Borderlands.

###### Alanyi bin Deri

**3rd level Crusader** (commissioned by Delian Teak)

**Stat Line:** AC 6, Spd 20’ /to 60’, HP 11, ATK 1 (Masterwork Mace 8+), Dmg 1d6/1d8, Init 0, ML +1, AL Lawful

**Attributes:** STR 9, INT 11, WIL 18, DEX 12, CON 9, CHA 16

**Saving Throws:** Paralysis 9+, Death 6+, Blast 12+, Implements 9+, Spells 11+

**Class Powers:** Performance (Oration), Rebuke Undead.

**Proficiencies:** Adventuring, Diplomacy, Prophecy.

**Languages:** Common Auran, Opelenean.

**Spellcasting:** Caster Level 3, Spells per Day 2 1st, 1 2nd.

**Spell Repertoire:** Crusader Spell Repertoire.

**Equipment:** Masterwork mace (+1/0), masterwork shield (+1 AC), chain mail, grey linen cassock, hemp sandals, hemp belt, holy symbol (winged sun of Ammonar), backpack with *potion of discern evil,* purse (20gp, 20sp).

**Mount:** Medium horse, riding tack and saddle, saddlebag with blanket, mess kit, tinderbox, 6 torches, waterskin, 1 week iron rations

**Background:** From out of the Opelenean desert comes Alanyi bin Deri: a hermit, a prophet of Ammonar, and a man of unshakable conviction. For the last year, Alanyi has suffered from visions of orcs and humans clashing in bloody combat far to the east, in the Borderlands of the Empire. Alanyi can no more ignore the call from the gods than he can live without air itself. Marching east, Alanyi has collected a small entourage of adventurers eager to face the tides of darkness with him. Whether they fight for his righteous cause or for glory or plunder is less important than that they fight — for Alanyi knows that if he fails, a reign of chaos such as the world has not seen in millennia will sweep across all of Cybele…

**Description:**  Alanyi is a medium-statured man with medium brown skin, wavy black hair, almond-shaped hazel eyes, and a well-kept curly black beard. Though not physically striking, his rich baritone voice impresses crowds when he speaks. He dresses humbly, in a loose linen cassock with woven belt and sandals.

**Notes:** Alanyi has Performance (Oration) in place of Theology to represent the fact that he is not a conventionally trained crusader. He has avoided censure thus far due to the gift of prophecy, but clashes with orthodox Empyrean clergy are likely to be a fixture wherever he goes. Unorthodox in his understanding of Ammonar, he is likely to take Syncretism if he advances in level.

###### Fingara

**3rd level Venturer** (commissioned by 2econd).

**Stat Line:** AC 2, Spd 30’ /to 90’, HP 10, ATK 1 (Masterwork Shortbow 7+), Dmg 1d6, Init +1, ML +1, AL Lawful

**Attributes:** STR 7, INT 10, WIL 9, DEX 13, CON 9, CHA 16

**Saving Throws:** Paralysis 12+, Death 12+, Blast 12+, Implements 13+, Spells 14+

**Class Powers:** Bribery, Diplomacy, Expert Bargaining, Expert Traveling, Mercantile Network, Multilingual, Pathfinding, Steady Trade Route, Treachery.

**Proficiencies:** Adventuring, Craft (Cooking), Precise Shooting.

**Languages:** Common, Classical Auran, Argollëan, Krysean, Nicean.

**Equipment:** Masterwork shortbow (+1/+1), quiver with 20 arrows, dagger, leather armor, hooded blue wool cloak, traveler’s tunic and pants, embossed leather belt, short leather boots, short leather gloves, backpack, *treasure map* (clay cuneiform tablet, TT B), journal, quill and ink, purse (20gp, 20sp), enc 3 2/6 st.

**Mount:** Medium horse, riding tack and saddle, saddlebag with blanket, mess kit, tinderbox, 6 torches, waterskin, 1 week iron rations

**Background:** A traveling merchant and baker, Fingara is a colorful and charming woman, who “has fingers in all the pies” as she likes to claim. This has admittedly left her with the nickname of the “Shitty Baker”, but in her inimitable style, Fingara has simply adopted the name — for all that her sweet pies are none too impressive, her meat pies are disturbingly good. Traveling through Southern Argollë, she met a peculiar prophet by the name of Alanyi, who convinced her to put her mercantile wiles to better use as a crusader for the Empyrean gods. Apparently, even those touched by the gods need to eat! For all her witty remarks and easygoing nature, Fingara knows too well the dangers the Chthonic raiders from the south pose, and is fully prepared to put her money where her mouth is to keep her country — and, more importantly, her customers — safe.

###### Inaya

**3rd level Bladedancer** (commissioned by Kevin Mattes)

**Stat Line:** AC 3, Spd 40’ / 120’, HP 12, ATK 1 (MW Short Swords 10+, or Spear 10+), Dmg 1d6 or 1d6/1d8, Init +2, ML +1, AL Lawful

**Attributes:** STR 11, INT 12, WIL 13, DEX 13, CON 9, CHA 13

**Saving Throws:** Paralysis 11+, Death 8+, Blast 14+, Implements 11+, Spells 13+

**Class Powers:** Graceful Fighting, Strength of Faith, Theology, Weapon Finesse.

**Proficiencies:** Adventuring, Blind-Fighting, Performance (dance).

**Languages:** Common, Classical Auran.

**Spellcasting:** Caster Level 3, Spells per Day 2 1st, 1 2nd.

**Spell Repertoire:** Bladedancer Spell Repertoire.

**Equipment:** Masterwork spear (+1/0), 2 masterwork short swords (+1/0), light arena armor, crimson silk cloak, crimson and gold chiton, gold silk sash, sandals, holy symbol (9-pointed star of Ianna), backpack with *potion of swift sword,* purse (20gp, 20sp), enc 3 4/6 st.

**Mount:** Light horse, riding tack and saddle, saddlebag with blanket, mess kit, tinderbox, 6 torches, waterskin, 1 week iron rations.

**Permanent Wounds**: Blind. Inaya’s blinded condition is partly ameliorated by her Blind-Fighting proficiency. If her blindness is cured, her attack throws will improve by 2 points and she will become able to make missile attacks.

**Background:** Inaya was born blind and abandoned to the care of the priestesses of Mityara in the Cyfaraun orphanage. The women who cared for her expected she would join the Keepers of the Hearth Fire, but their inability to cure her affliction led her to doubt their teachings. Instead, the fiery young woman committed to becoming a bladedancer of Ianna. For years, she was turned away by the Temple of the Blade and Veil, but Inaya diligently practiced the art of blind-fighting until her prowess was enough for the goddess to deem her fit for service. After several years as an itinerant bladedancer, she joined the entourage of the strange prophet Alanyi bin Deri when he told her “you are blind because the light of the Empyrean gods shines so brightly on you.” Perhaps due to her Mityaran upbringing, Inaya refuses to kill humans and demi-humans, even those who deserve it.

###### Norden Domekh

**3rd level Dwarven Fury** (commissioned by North Scorpion)

**Stat Line:** AC 4, Spd 40’ / 120’, HP 16, ATK 1 (Masterwork Battle Axe 8+), Dmg 1d6+4 / 1d8+4, Init 0, Surprise 0 (+1 underground), ML +2, AL Lawful

**Attributes:** STR 16, INT 10, WIL 10, DEX 10, CON 10, CHA 17

**Saving Throws:** Paralysis 8+, Death 9+, Blast 11+, Implements 11+, Spells 12+

**Class Powers:** Dwarf Tongues, Fighting Fury, Flesh-Runes (DR 1), Hardy, Intimidation, Savage Resilience, Sensitivity to Rock & Stone.

**Proficiencies:** Adventuring, Combat Ferocity, Fighting Style (weapon & shield), Intimidation, Manual of Arms.

**Languages:** Common, Dwarvish, Kobold, Gnome, Goblin.

**Equipment:** Masterwork battle axe (+1/0), dagger, masterwork shield (+1 AC), hooded grey wool cloak, leather tunic and pants, embossed leather belt, short leather boots, short leather gloves, backpack with *oil of sharpness,* purse (20gp, 20sp), enc. 1 4/6 st.

**Mount:** Mule, riding tack and saddle, saddlebag with blanket, mess kit, tinderbox, 6 torches, waterskin, 1 week iron rations.

**Background:** The dwarves are known as a stubborn people, with a grimly defensive mindset that has seen them endure where men and elves would have broken long ago. But the furies, blood-sworn avengers of dwarvenkind, are the exception that tests this rule. Norden is one such fury. Driven by a dream of glorious battle against Chthonic forces, Norden has undertaken a warrior’s pilgrimage to the Borderlands. There he has joined the entourage of the divine prophet Alanyi bin Deri. Though he has great faith in his gods and ancestors, Norden knows little of the Empyrean religion. He is only slowly beginning to realize that his friend Alanyi’s teachings might not be entirely orthodox...

**Description:** Norden is a thickly-muscled dwarf with a shaven scalp, a chest-length dark beard, and an impressively broken nose set below bright, almost crazed, eyes. Adding to his fearsome presence are the countless flesh-runes that have been inked across his face, scalp, arms, and torso, marred here and there by sword-cuts and scars. Although he tries to be kind and agreeable in his own way, Norden has a certain unpredictable energy that terrifies his enemies — and, sometimes, his allies.

**Note:** The dwarven fury class is from our dwarf sourcebook ***By This Axe****.* Judges without access to the sourcebook can use Norden as a vaultguard instead by changing Fighting Style Specialization to Berserkergang and equipping him with heavy armor.

###### Sigrún Wave-Rider

**3rd level Jutland Barbarian** (commissioned by DR)

**Stat Line:** AC 6, Spd 20’ / 60’, HP 15, ATK 1 (Masterwork Battle Axe 8+), Dmg 1d6/1d8+2, Init +1, ML +1, AL Neutral

**Attributes:** STR 16, INT 13, WIL 10, DEX 10, CON 10, CHA 17

**Saving Throws:** Paralysis 12+, Death 13+, Blast 14+, Implements 15+, Spells 16+

**Class Powers:** Animal Reflexes, Climbing, Savage Resilience, Seafaring.

**Proficiencies:** Adventuring, Command, Fighting Style (Weapon & Shield), Seafaring 3.

**Languages:** Common, Jutlandic, Dwarvish (Jutting dialect).

**Equipment:** Masterwork battle axe (+1/0), dagger, masterwork shield (+1 AC), chain mail, hooded navy-blue silk cloak, fine leather tunic and pants, embossed leather belt, tall leather boots, long leather gloves, backpack, *potion of swimming,* purse (20gp, 20sp).

**Mount:** Medium horse, riding tack and saddle, saddlebag with blanket, mess kit, tinderbox, 6 torches, waterskin, 1 week iron rations.

**Background:** A harsh place at the best of times, Jutland provides the Auran Empire with a seemingly endless supply of hardy warriors and adventurers, and Sigrún Wave-Rider is no exception. Lacking in conventional beauty and with the kind of hotheaded attitude and temper that made marrying her off an impossibility, Sigrún found her father was only too happy to let her go off and seek a glorious death in combat — and the farther away from the other rulers he was trying to delicately outmaneuver, the better. Sigrún cheerfully set sail for the Krysea, and hearing of trouble in the Borderlands, made her way there in search of plunder and glory. Along the way she fell in with a man by the name of Alanyi bin Deri, who claimed to have been touched by the gods. He is certainly… touched…. But Sigrún cares little for such matters. What she does care about is loot — and fighting alongside the dark-skinned crusader has certainly resulted in plenty of gold! Soon, she’ll have the funds she needs to buy a galley with good oars and plunder distant shores.

**Description:** Sigrún is a Jutlandic woman with a thickly-muscled physique, violet eyes, and platinum blonde hair she wears tied into a long braid. No one would describe her as beautiful, but she is nevertheless formidable and unforgettable. Despite the warm weather of the Borderlands, she continues to dress in the Jutlandic style, with a mail byrnie beneath a fur-lined cloak.
