## Spell Repertoire

The spells available to a spellcaster are called his **spell repertoire**.Practitioners ofdifferent types of magic acquire their repertoire in very different ways. There are three mutually exclusive ways that casters of a particular type of magic might acquire its spells, **prayer, study**, and **inheritance**. Casters and magic types which use these methods are called **prayerful,** **studious,** and **inherited** respectively.

In ***ACKS II****,* all arcane magic is studious, and most divine magic is prayerful. (Dwarven craftpriests and witches use studious divine magic.) When creating a custom magic type, however, you have complete freedom. A magic type’s source factors for spell type, its spell progression, and its method of learning spells are all distinct choices when using these rules!

### Prayerful

Prayerful magic is acquired from beseeching extraplanar sources. Prayerful casters receive their repertoires from prayer to the deity, demon, elemental lord, god, or other power they serve. In order to maintain these repertoires they must pray each day. Each prayerful caster has a repertoire consisting of a flat number of spells of each level they can cast, representing those miracles the deity has empowered them to perform.

###### Number of Spells in Repertoire

The number of spells of each level in a prayerful caster’s repertoire is equal to (5000 / Base XP Cost), rounded up. If the caster has more or less than a full level progression, this repertoire may be increased or decreased. See the **Magic Type Class Category** section, below.

EXAMPLE: The Faery magic type has a Base XP Cost of 1,500. If the Faery magic type were prayerful, it would have a repertoire of (5000 / 1,500) = 3.33, rounded up to 4, spells per level. This Judge decides to select a different repertoire acquisition method.

Do *not* select spells for the repertoire now! The selection of spells in a prayerful spell repertoire comes when custom classes are created that use the magic type. The exact spells available for any given prayerful caster class could vary widely. For example, the Crusader Spell List, Shaman Spell List, and Bladedancer Spell List in ***ACKS II***are all examples of the same magic type, Divine, but their spell repertoires vary considerably.

###### Prayer Requirement

To stay in the favor of his deity, a prayerful spellcaster must pray at an appointed time (usually sunrise or sunset) for at least one hour per day. This prayer counts as an ancillary activity. A prayerful spellcaster who fails to pray at the appointed time more than once in any seven days becomes **disfavored** by his deity. A prayerful caster can also become disfavored if he fails to uphold his class’s code of behavior (Judge’s discretion). Each time a disfavored castercasts a spell, he must roll 1d6. On a 1-2, the spell fails. The failed spell still counts against the number of spells he can cast per day. Disfavor from failure to pray ends as soon as the caster meets his daily prayer requirement. Undead in *torpor* (p. XX) never become disfavored for failing to pray, as the dark god knows why they slumber.

###### Reversed Spell

Prayerful spellcasters will know both the normal and reversed form of any spell on their spell list. However, Lawful prayerful spellcasters prefer to cast spells in their normal form, and will use the reversed forms only against Chaotic opponents**.** Conversely, Chaotic prayerful spellcasters will freely cast reversed spells, while using the normal version only to aid comrades and followers. Some prayerful spellcasters may be restricted entirely by their deity from using normal or reversed versions of particular spells (Judge’s discretion).

### Studious

Studious magic is acquired from intense study. Studious casters receive their repertoire of spells from the study of **spell formulas**.In order to maintain these repertoires they must study the formulas each day. A spell formula consists of various texts, diagrams, illustrations, and charts written on one or more pieces of paper (or equivalent material). A spell’s formula always takes up one page (or equivalent) per spell level. A caster must be able to read the language used in the formula in order to study it, making the ability to speak many languages very valuable for every studious caster.

###### Number of Spells in Repertoire

Each studious spellcaster has his own unique repertoire of spells determined by the spell formulas he frequently studies. It might be just one spell or dozens. The maximum number and level of spells in a studious caster’s repertoire is equal to the number and level of spells he can cast per day. This maximum is increased by the caster’s Intellect bonus. Thus studious casters of limited experience and middling Intellect are restricted to small repertoires while powerful and intelligent casters can have large repertoires.

To organize their collection of spell formulas, studious casters gather them together in **spell books**.A spell book can be, but does not have to be, an actual codex. Some spell books are true works of art, cased in precious metal or rare wood, with vellum pages illumined and illustrated with colorful inks. Others resemble a pile of scrolls shoved in a box in alphabetic order. A typical spellbook is a sturdy leatherbound parchment codex with 100 pages. A blank 100-page spell book costs 20gp.

A 1st level studious spellcaster starts the game with a base of one 1st level spell in his repertoire, plus one additional 1st level spell per point of Intellect bonus. Each time he advances in level, a studious spellcasters increases his maximum repertoire by one or more spells. To take advantage of this increased maximum, the caster will need to acquire the spell formulas for the spells he wants to add to his repertoire. There are a number of ways in which a studious caster can acquire spell formulas.

* He can copy a spell formula from a magic scroll, fellow mage’s spell book, or other source straight into his own spell book. He can copy an existing formula at a rate of one page per day of dedicated activity, plus one page per rank in Art (calligraphy) or Craft (scribing). The caster cannot engage in any other major activity that day. He must have a book with blank pages available to copy into.
* He can buy or steal a spell formula or even an entire spell book from another mage. In this case, he does not need to re-write a formula in his own hand unless he wants to; some casters are comfortable having their spell formula spread out across many volumes by different authors. Others are more fastidious and prefer to copy each spell formula they find in their own hand, perhaps translating it into a preferred language as they do.
* He can engage in spell research in order to discover the formula for an existing or new spell. Spell research is a lengthy and expensive proposition that only can be pursued by experienced casters.
* Whatever method the caster uses to get the spell formula, the next step will be to put it in his repertoire, either by adding it to an incomplete repertoire or replacing an existing spell in a full repertoire.

###### Adding or Replacing Spells

If a studious caster has fewer spells in his repertoire than his permitted maximum, he can add a spell to his repertoire by studying its spell formula as a dedicated activity for one week. When he has finished his week of intense study, he can add the spell to his repertoire.

If a studious caster already has the maximum number of spells in his repertoire, he can replace a spell in his repertoire with a new spell of the same level. He still must dedicate a week to studying the new spell formula, but when he has finished his week of intense study, he replaces one spell of the same level with the new spell he has learned. The caster chooses which spell to replace. Replacing a spell in the repertoire does not cause the character to lose the formula of the replaced spell.

###### Recovering from a Lost or Destroyed Spellbook

Sometimes, through bad fortune or enemy action, the spell book containing the formula for a studious caster’s repertoire might get lost or destroyed. If necessary, a studious caster can re-write the spell formulas from memory. It takes one day of dedicated activity per page to write down a spell formula from memory.

EXAMPLE: When Quintus finally confronts the vandal who captured him, he discovers the nasty fellow burned his spellbook to ash. After killing the vandal, Quintus sets out to re-create his spell book. The spell formulas for each of the four 1st level spells in his repertoire are one page each. The spell formulas for each of the three 2nd level spells in his repertoire are two pages each. Therefore it takes him (4 x 1) + (3 x 2) = 10 days to re-write his spell book. Since his spell book originally had 10 pages, this makes sense!

###### Study Requirement

To keep himself attuned to the power of magic, a studious caster must track the alignment of the celestial spheres, the astrological movements of the stars, the waxing and waning of the planets, and other factors of metaphysical importance. Each day, after he rests, a studious caster must spend at least one hour reviewing these factors. This study counts as an ancillary activity. A studious caster who misses more than one day of study in any seven days becomes **forgetful** when casting spells. Each time a forgetful castercasts a spell, he must roll 1d6. On a 1-2, the spell fails. The failed spell still counts against the number of spells he can cast per day. Forgetfulness ends as soon as the caster meets his daily study requirement. Undead in *torpor* (p. XX) never become forgetful, as no time passes for them.

In order to meet his daily study requirement, a studious caster must have the spell formula for each of the spells in his repertoire at hand. If the caster does not have physical access to one or more of the spell formulas, he becomes **forgetful** when casting those spells. To avoid becoming forgetful, a studious caster who adventurers away from home should be sure to bring a spell book containing the necessary formulas with him!

Poor or inexperienced studious casters often have just one small spell book, which they guard jealously. More established studious casters tend to own many spell books, with one or more “traveling” spell books containing the formulas for the spells in their repertoire, and the rest containing the formulas for spells not in their repertoire. These latter spellbooks can be consulted should the caster wish to change his repertoire (see below). Extra spell books are usually kept in a library, laboratory, or secure vault.

###### Reversed Spells

Studious spellcasters treat the normal and reversed version of a spell as separate spells.

### Inherited

Inherited magic is just that, inherited – the caster is born with the power to cast spells. Like studious spellcasters, inherited spellcasters have only a limited repertoire of spells, equal to the number and level of spells they can cast per day. The number of spells of each level in the repertoire is increased by the caster’s Charisma bonus. (At your discretion you can create inherited magic types that benefit from abilities other than Charisma.)

As inherited casters advance in level, they automatically learn new spells equal to the number and level of spells the caster can use in a single day. They do not need or benefit from masters, spellbooks, or scrolls, and are not beholden to any deity or higher power that limits their repertoire. Unlike studious spellcasters, they may not change spells in their repertoire.

EXAMPLE: The Faery magic type has an inherited spell repertoire. Faery casters have a spell repertoire equal to the number and level of spells they can cast per day, increased by their Charisma bonus.
