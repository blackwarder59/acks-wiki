## Shields

Throughout history, the type of shield carried by warriors has varied depending on the warrior’s arms, armor, and equipment. These optional rules allow you to simulate these historical variations. When these rules apply,
standard shields should not be available; all shields have a type. In addition, note that characters do not gain a benefit from their shields when **vulnerable** when using these rules. (This is to make up for the other benefits the new shields offer.)

###### Auxiliary Shield

An auxiliary shield is a hexagonal or oval shield measuring approximately 2’ wide and 3.5’ tall. It is designed for light infantry and cavalry soldiers. An auxiliary shield can be carried in hand or strapped on the back to free up both hands. When equipped in hand by a dismounted character, an auxiliary shield grants a +1 bonus to his Armor Class except when the character is surprised, retreating, or attacked from behind. When equipped in hand by a mounted character, an auxiliary shield grants a +1 bonus to his *or* his mount’s Armor Class except when the character is vulnerable. The character can alternate between using the shield to protect himself or his mount each time he moves. When strapped on the back, an auxiliary shield grants a +1 bonus to Armor Class when the character is attacked from behind. Fighting Style Specialization (Weapon & Shield) does not increase this bonus. However it is carried, an auxiliary shield has an encumbrance of 1 stone. Historical examples include the Roman *parma* and various cavalry shields of Antiquity.

###### Buckler

A buckler is a round shield with a diameter of up to 2’. It has an encumbrance of 1 item. A buckler can be used by infantry or cavalry, but takes considerable skill. Characters with Fighting Style Specialization (Weapon & Shield) gain a +1 bonus to Armor Class when they have a buckler equipped. Other characters gain no benefit. An equipped buckler does not protect a character (or mount) that is vulnerable. The chief historical example is the Renaissance buckler.

###### Crescent Shield

A crescent shield is an oval-shaped shield with cut-outs on one or both sides to form a single or double crescent shape. It is designed for both infantry and cavalry soldiers. A crescent shield can be carried in hand or strapped on the front or back to free up both hands. When equipped in hand, a crescent shield grants a +1 bonus to Armor Class except when the character is vulnerable. It has an encumbrance of 1 stone. When strapped on the front, a crescent shield grants a +1 bonus to Armor Class except when the character is vulnerable. Fighting Style Specialization (Weapon & Shield) does not increase this bonus. When strapped on the back, a crescent shield grants a +1 bonus to Armor Class when the character is attacked from behind. Fighting Style Specialization (Weapon & Shield) does not increase this bonus. It has an encumbrance of 1 stone, or 2 stone if strapped on the front. The chief historical example is the Mycenean proto-dipylon shield and the Greek peltes.

###### Heater Shield

A heater is a heart-shaped shield measuring 2’ across the top and 3’ along its vertical axis. It is designed for both infantry and cavalry soldiers. A heater shield can be equipped in hand or strapped on the back to free up both hands. When equipped in hand by a dismounted character, a heater shield grants a +1 bonus to his Armor Class except when the character is vulnerable. When equipped in hand by a mounted character, a heater shield grants a +1 bonus to his *or* his mount’s Armor Class except when the character is surprised, retreating, or attacked from behind. The character can alternate between using the shield to protect himself or his mount each time he moves. When strapped on the back, a heater shield grants a +1 bonus to Armor Class when the character is attacked from behind. Fighting Style Specialization (Weapon & Shield) does not increase this bonus. However it is carried, a heater shield has an encumbrance of 1 stone. Historical examples include the Roman *parma* and various cavalry shields of Antiquity.

###### Kite Shield

A kite shield is a leaf- or almond-shaped shield, rounded on top and curving down to a point at the bottom. It measures 2.5’ across the top and 4’ to 5’ along its vertical axis. It is designed for cavalry. A dismounted character who has a kite shield equipped has his Armor Class increased by 1 point but suffers encumbrance of 2 stone. A mounted character who has a kite shield equipped has both his and his mount’s Armor Class increased by 1 point. The rider and the mount each suffer encumbrance of 1 stone. A kite shield cannot be strapped on the back. An equipped kite shield does not protect a character (or mount) that is vulnerable. The chief historical example is the Norman kite shield depicted in the Bayeux Tapestry.

###### Phalanx Shield

A phalanx shield is a curved dipylon, figure-eight, rectangular, or round shield. Dipylon, figure-eight, and rectangular shields measure 2.75’ wide and 3.5’ tall, while round shields measure 3’ in diameter, with all weighing around 22 lbs. Despite the weight, its shape and straps make it easy to carry and wield with one arm. A phalanx shield cannot be used by a mounted character. A dismounted character who has a phalanx shield equipped has his Armor Class increased by 1 point but suffers an encumbrance of 1 stone. He is considered to have a shield for purposes of the Defend action. A phalanx shield cannot be strapped on the back. A phalanx shield does not protect a character that is vulnerable. Historical examples include the Greek *aspis,* the Roman *scutum,* the Mycenean figure-eight shield, and the Achaean dipylon shield.

###### Troop Types by Shield

In the Auran Empire campaign setting, heavy infantry with shields will be carrying phalanx type; crossbowmen, light infantry, slingers, with shields will be carrying auxiliary or crescent type; and cavalry equipped with shields will be carrying auxiliary, crescent, or heater shields. Heavy infantry with polearms might be equipped with crescent shields strapped to front, with one step lighter armor, e.g. instead of banded plate and polearm, they might be equipped with laminated linen armor, crescent shield, and polearm.
