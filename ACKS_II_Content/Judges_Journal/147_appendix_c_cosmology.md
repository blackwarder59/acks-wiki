# Appendix C: Cosmology

As a general design principle, ***ACKS II***holds that game mechanics should always be justified by, or at least compatible with, the underlying reality of a coherent game world. Some of the mechanics of ***ACKS II***have profound implications for what that underlying reality must be. Game mechanics such as arcane and divine magic; divine power; sacrifice and congregants; reincarnation and resurrection – all demand an explanation or explanations.

Accordingly this section includes a complete and self-consistent metaphysical system that offers in-world explanations for the mysterious phenomenon implied by ***ACKS II***’sgame mechanics. It is, in other words, the implied metaphysicsof the Auran Empire campaign setting.

There are, of course, many possible explanations to things such as reincarnation and undeath, including the possibility of providing no explanation at all (“it’s a great mystery”). The answers below are merely one set of possible explanations. As Judge, it is your prerogative to change or ignore any of them; but even if your intent is to create your own metaphysical explanations, we feel confident that it’s easier to be creative when there’s an established framework to compare and contrast against.

The metaphysical explanations below are provided in a question-and-answer format. This is both for ease of reading and reference, and also because it is the most likely means for such explanations to arise in play – as adventurers like to ask difficult questions. Note that in many cases, the answers below reveal that the mythology and history of Cybele presented in earlier chapters is somewhere between “true from a certain point of view” to “outright false”.
