## Abstract Wilderness Encounters Evasion

An expedition may attempt to evade a wilderness encounter rather than face it. Resolve the evasion attempt using the mechanics described in the ***ACKS Revised Rulebook***(p. XX). All of the various monster abilities, character proficiencies, and class powers that would affect a wilderness evasion throw apply to this evasion throw normally. You can also apply any situational modifiers you deem appropriate. The expedition can take advantage of the Forlorn Hope and Sauve Qui Peut mechanics if desired.

If the expedition successfully evades, they get away. They receive no experience or treasure, but survive without any casualties. If they fail to evade, they have been caught, and must face the encounter. If the expedition splits up into smaller groups, any of the groups that fail collectively share the encounter, which is assumed to occur before they managed to split up.
