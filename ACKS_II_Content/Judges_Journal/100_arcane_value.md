## Arcane Value

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Value** | **Arcane** | **XP Cost** |
| 4 | 100% Arcane Power | 2500 |
| 3 | 66% Arcane Power | 1875 |
| 2 | 50% Arcane Power | 1250 |
| 1 | 33% Arcane Power | 625 |
| 0 | No Arcane Power | 0 |

The Arcane Value determines the extent of the class’s arcane spellcasting abilities, if any. Assign 0 to 4 build points to the class’s Arcane Value, noting down the appropriate powers and the XP cost.

**Arcane 1:** An Arcane Value of 1 gives the class the ability to casts spells and engage in magical research at only about one-third the power of a mage of the same class level. The class uses its effective caster level for purposes of level-dependent spell ranges, durations, and damage.

**Arcane 2:** An Arcane Value of 2 gives the class the ability to casts spells and engage in magical research at about one-half the power of a mage of the same class level. The class uses its effective caster level for purposes of level-dependent spell ranges, durations, and damage.

**Arcane 3:** An Arcane Value of 3 gives the class the ability to casts spells and engage in magical research at approximately two-thirds the power of a mage of the same class level. The class uses its effective caster level for purposes of level-dependent spell ranges, durations, and damage.

**Arcane 4:** An Arcane Value of 4 gives the class the ability to cast spells and engage in magical research as a mage.

### Delayed Arcane Spell Progressions

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Arcane 1 – Delayed Acquisition** | | | | | | | |
| **Level** | **1st** | **2nd** | **3rd** | **4th** | **5th** | **6th** | **Caster Level** |
| **1** | - | - | - | - | - | - | - |
| **2** | - | - | - | - | - | - | - |
| **3** | - | - | - | - | - | - | - |
| **4** | - | - | - | - | - | - | - |
| **5** | - | - | - | - | - | - | - |
| **6** | - | - | - | - | - | - | - |
| **7** | - | - | - | - | - | - | - |
| **8** | 2 | 1 | - | - | - | - | 3 |
| **9** | 2 | 2 | 1 | - | - | - | 5 |
| **10** | 3 | 3 | 2 | - | - | - | 6 |
| **11** | 3 | 3 | 2 | 1 | - | - | 7 |
| **12** | 3 | 3 | 2 | 2 | - | - | 8 |
| **13** | 3 | 3 | 2 | 2 | 1 | - | 9 |
| **14** | 3 | 3 | 2 | 2 | 2 | - | 10 |

At your discretion, a fractional level of arcane casting ability can be traded in for a superior arcane casting progression unlocked at a higher level. When the higher level is reached, the character will gain the ability to cast spells and his spellcasting ability will thereafter advance rapidly with each level of experience earned, as shown on the table below. By using a delayed arcane spell progression, it is possible to create a class with Arcane Value 2 that can eventually cast 6th level spells.
