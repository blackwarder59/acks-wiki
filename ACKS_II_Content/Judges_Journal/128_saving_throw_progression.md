## Saving Throw Progression

In the custom class creation system, every class is assigned a saving throw progression based on its highest of the four class category values (Fighting, Thievery, Divine, or Arcane). The saving throw progression is critical, because it also determines the character’s magical item options, prime requisite, proficiencies, and hit points after 9th level.

Since these rules add the ability to create new class category values offering new magic types, it is entirely possible that character classes might have saving throw progressions that don’t exist yet. For instance, at what rate does a class with Faery 3, Fighting 1 advance in saving throws? How many hit points does it receive after 9th level? What magic items can it use? These rules explain how to create a unique saving throw progression for newly-created class categories.

###### Progression Rate

The class category of a new magic type will have a saving throw progression rate such as “2 points every 6 levels”. This rate is determined by its source factor total, its repertoire acquisition method, and its code of behavior.

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Source Factor Total** | **Inherited or Studious,**  **No Code of Behavior** | **Inherited or Studious,**  **With Code of Behavior** | **Any Prayerful** |
| 12.5 or less | 2 points every 6 levels | 2 points every 6 levels | 2 points every 4 levels |
| 12.6 – 13.5 | 2 points every 6 levels | 2 points every 4 levels | 2 points every 4 levels |
| 13.6 or more | 2 points every 4 levels | 2 points every 4 levels | 2 points every 4 levels |

EXAMPLE: Faery magic is inherited, imposes a code of behavior, and has a source factor total of 12.75. Classes with the Faery saving throwing progression will improve their saving throws by 2 points every 4 levels (like a crusader).

The saving throw progression rate also determines proficiency acquisition; characters choose one additional proficiency chosen from their class list each time they complete a full (2-point) saving throw progression.

EXAMPLE: Classes with the Faery saving throw progression will gain one class proficiency at 4th, 8th, and 12th level.

###### Magic Item Usage

The magic items available to classes with the new saving throw progression are determined by cross-referencing its repertoire acquisition method with the quotient of its Blast modifier / Healing modifier on the table below. If a choice of two magic item selections is available, the choice should be made by class, not by class category.

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Source Factor Total** | **Blast modifier / Healing modifier** | | |
| *0.67 – 1.10* | *1.10 – 1.50* | *1.6 – 2.25* |
| 12.5 or less | Arcane | Arcane and Divine | Arcane or Divine |
| 12.6 – 13.5 | Arcane or Divine | Arcane and Divine | Arcane or Divine |
| 13.6 or more | Arcane or Divine | Arcane and Divine | Divine |

EXAMPLE: Faery magic has a source factor total of 12.75. It has a Blast modifier of 2.25 and a Healing modifier of 1, which yields a quotient of 2.25. Therefore the class category can offer the ability to use either mage or crusader magic items. This choice is left open until specific custom classes are built for the magic type.

###### Prime Requisite

The prime requisite(s) of classes with the new saving throw progression are determined by cross-referencing its repertoire acquisition method with the quotient of its Blast modifier / Healing modifier on the table below. If a choice of two prime requisites is available, the choice should be made by class, not by class category.

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Repertoire** | **Blast modifier / Healing modifier** | | |
| *0.67 – 1.10* | *1.10 – 1.50* | *1.6 – 2.25* |
| Prayerful | INT and WIL | INT or WIL | WIL |
| Studious | INT | INT or WIL | INT and WIL |
| Inherited | INT and CHA | CHA | CHA and WIL |

EXAMPLE: Faery magic is inherited. It has a Blast modifier of 2.25 and a Healing modifier of 1, which yields a quotient of 2.25. The prime requisites of classes with the Faery saving throw progression will therefore be CHA and WIL.

###### Hit Points after 9th Level

Any class category offering spellcasting will have a saving throw progression that grants 1 hit point per level after 9th.

###### Hit Points after 9th Level

After 8th level, the amount of experience required to advance no longer doubles. Instead, it increases by a flat amount each level. The amount required is based on the saving throw progression. Determine this amount based on the magic type’s source factor total:

* Source Factor total of 14 or more: Additional 100,000XP for each level after 8th.
* Source factor total 13.1 to 14: An additional 120,000XP for each level after 8th.
* Source factor total 13 or less: An additional 150,000XP for each level after 8th.

EXAMPLE: Faery magic has a source factor total of 12.75. Classes with the Faery saving throw progression will require an additional 150,000XP for each level of advancement after 8th.
