## The Company of the North

The Company of the North is a mercenary band founded by a Jutland war-chief who seeks glorious death in battle against chaos. Its other members, though equally formidable, are somewhat less devoted to this militant cause.

**Mount:** Medium warhorse, war saddle and tack, saddlebag with blanket, mess kit, tinderbox, 6 torches, waterskin, 1 week iron rations.

**Holdings:** Jarldom of North Skavan (outlands clanhold; stronghold value: 180,000gp; personal domain population 6,375 peasant families and 250 urban families; realm population 175,000 families; realm income: 66,000gp/month).

**Followers/Mercenaries:** 120 Jutlandic huscarls (spear, sword, chain mail, shield). Other henchmen and followers have remained to govern his jarldom.

**Side Effects:** Notably Scarred (+1 Intimidation, -2 to impersonate others).

**Background:** When Kael ó Conchúir was born, the runecasters proclaimed him destined for greatness. They were right: A thane’s son hailing from the western reaches of Jutland, Kael grew into a natural leader and born warrior. He has travelled the length and breadth of the Ammasaurëan Sea. Some say he even passed north of the Jutting Mountains, from whence he returned with his magical blade — and a long scar down the right side of his face. Whatever the truth of such tales, after his return, he overthrew the jarl his father had served and claimed the jarldom as his by right of conquest. There he might have stayed, a jarl of fierce disposition but uncommon wisdom, had not the runecasters and shamans of his clan told of him of a terrible threat rising far to the southeast. Leaving his jarldom in his son’s safe hands, Kael ó Conchúir set out for one last adventure, one guaranteed to earn him a glorious afterlife dying in battle against the horrors his blade thirsts to destroy.

**Description:** Kael is a tall and strongly-built Jutlander with ruddy skin and red hair and beard now streaked with gray. His face is battered from wind and cold, with many scars, the largest of which is a jagged gash from hairline to chin that just misses his red eye. Kael claims that his great sword, the *Shard of the North,* was forged before the Day Without Night and given to him by a winged sage who lived in the mountains. True or not, the remarkable weapon is forged of white orichalcum in an ancient style reminiscent of swords illustrated on mosaics in the hilltop ruins of the Syrnasos.

###### Ravus Faelus

**9th level Thief** (commissioned by D.)

**Stat Line:** AC 4, Spd 40’ / 120’, HP 27, ATK 1 (*+1 shortbow* 4+ or masterworksword 6+), Dmg 1d6+2 or 1d6, Init +1, ML +2, AL Neutral

**Mount:** Light horse, riding saddle and tack, saddlebag with blanket, mess kit, tinderbox, 6 torches, waterskin, 1 week iron rations.

**Holdings:** Hideout in Samos (7,350gp syndicate revenue; 12,250gp guild revenue; 36,000gp treasury)

**Followers/Mercenaries:** 108 ruffians (49 0th level, 36 1st level, 14 2nd level, 5 3rd level, 2 4th level, 1 5th level, 1 6th level).

**Background:** Ravus Faelus has done quite well for himself in the permissive and uncertain environment of the crumbling Auran Empire. With a shifting cast of fellow ne’er-do-wells at his side, his meticulously-planned heists have looted fortunes of gold and goods from such former owners as Dirgion death-cults, Imperial border forts, and Argollëan elf-tombs. His audacious guile does not end with mere wealth acquisition: he famously escaped prison while awaiting trial for high treason (after being caught red-handed sifting through the Prefect’s own quarters searching for compromising information); once free he was able to not only ‘clear’ his name, but to also purchase an Imperial rank of Patrician through judiciously-applied blackmail, astoundingly-generous donations to the priestesses of the Lady of Fortune, and naked politicking. To further his reputation, he has now generously endowed Kael’s adventuring party in its “defense of the Borderlands.” Ravus assiduously forgoes physical confrontation whenever possible, and considers his efforts a failure if he has to personally draw steel at any point; despite this maxim of eschewing heroics, several of his greatest hijinks unexpectedly have dealt heavy blows to the forces of Chaos. Heavy, profitable blows.

**Description:** Ravus is of medium height and medium build, with features best described as “nondescript.” When it benefits him to appear otherwise, however, he can shed his modest mien and present himself as a man of dignity and status —a necessity when rubbing shoulders with his fellow Patricians at contrived social events.

**Followers/Mercenaries:** 11 apprentices (3 3rd level mages, 8 0th level apprentice mages).

**Background:** Asyif was born to a noble family in Zidium, capital of Celdorea. When Asyif was but a child, his father was sent, family in tow, to Aura as an emissary of the Celdorean shah. In Aura, the young Celdorean displayed a promising gift for sorcery; his father begrudgingly permitted him to study magic at the Tower of Knowledge. During the course of his studies, Asyif become fascinated by the lost secrets of the elves. Departing Aura for Southern Argollë, he eventually made his way to Cyfaraun, capital of the Borderlands. Since his father has cut him off from his family wealth for refusing to return home, Asyif needs to adventure to fund his research into ancient elven magic. The Company of the North seemed as good a band as any with which to explore and plunder.

**Description:** Asyif eschews the robes of a wizard, instead dressing with all the extravagance of a wealthy Celdorean noble at court. The only evidence of his sorcerous powers is his owl-tipped *staff +1*. Though handsome and noble in visage, he always conceals his face in public beneath a polished silver mask that resembles a cataphract face-plate. The mask is actually a magic item of his own creation, equivalent to a *brooch of arcane armor* except in presentation*.*

###### Dalefa Sarëdis

**Followers/Mercenaries:** 8 apprentices (1 3rd level witch, 1 2nd level witch, 6 0th level apprentice witches).

**Background:** Though the forests of Southern Argollë have largely disappeared as human civilization has marched across the region, many of those areas that remain are often known for the dark things that still lurk in shadowed groves, and those who live near them speak variously of missing children, unearthly lights, or haunting sounds when the moon is hidden. Into this world was born Dalefa Sarëdis. Marked with the dove of Mityara over her heart and the ears of an elf, Dalefa was destined from birth to tread the boundary between the seen and unseen worlds, and in her early teens first made contact with the spirits that roam Southern Argollë. Spurred on by fate and her unseen allies, she won considerable renown as an adventurer in her homeland, working tirelessly to undo the damage caused by the terrible events of the past. Though she would prefer the seclusion of her cottage, Dalefa cannot stand by while beastmen raids worsen the plight of the Borderlands. The Chthonic threat must be extinguished, and the troubled Borderlands secured for the Auran Empire once more. Kael ó Conchúir, though not even from this land, knows what must be done, and that is why she follows him.

**Description:** Dalefa is petite, but sturdy, with a round face, green eyes, naturally curly shoulder-length blonde hair. Her elven bloodline is evident, not just from her pointed ears and high cheekbones, but in her ageless appearance. Though she has adventured for decades Dalefa still appears no older than 20.

**Mount:**Light horse, riding saddle and tack, saddlebag with blanket, mess kit, tinderbox, 4 stakes and mallet, 6 iron spikes, 6 torches, waterskin, 1 week iron rations.

**Holdings:**SecludedMountain Border Fort and Surrounding Lands (outlands; stronghold value: 60,000gp; personal domain population 215 peasant families; realm income: 1,3000gp/month).

**Followers/Mercenaries:** 60 hunters (bola, net, 3 javelins, hand axe, leather armor), 60 light infantry (spear, battle axe, shield, leather armor), and 60 longbowmen (long bow, sword, chain mail). A alchemist, armorer, chirugeon, two creature handlers, and other hirelings maintain the mountain hold.

**Background**: Bodo spent most of his youth traveling with his father Mencida, a merchant of middling success, from the Krysean coast to Aura and beyond. His mother had died in childbirth, and with no one to help raise the boy, Mencida instilled responsibility and independence at an early age. While dutiful to his father, Bodo was never drawn to follow in his footsteps, although he proved to have an uncanny knack with animals, both in the traveling caravans and in the wilds. This gift led Mencida to the conclusion that Bodo was gifted by Naurivus for some divine purpose beyond a merchant’s trade, and as his son came of age he sent him out to find his purpose in this world. Bodo left the merchant’s life to serve a brief stint in the Imperial Army and was trained as a scout and sniper. However he found military discipline chafing and returned to his homeland in Krysea as soon as he was able. In the intervening years, Bodo has gained fame as a dangerous foe to the beastmen and darker horrors that lurk in the Meniri Mountains. For his service to the Empire, Bodo was granted permission to established a small fiefdom in the southern marches of Krysea. He has spent the last several years ruling from an ancient stronghold taken by force from a petty hobgoblin chief, which he has repurposed as a trading post and citadel to protect key mountain passes from the dangers that arise in the Waste. Recently, he has left the stronghold in the care of his able steward in order to travel to the increasingly-endangered Borderlands, where has joined the Company of the North as a guide for their expedition into the Zaharan Waste.

**Description**: Standing 5’7” with light brown eyes and wavy, dark auburn hair, Bodo’s tanned and wind-battered complexion and simple, homespun appearance belie his skill and instinctive grace as well as his station. Only the elegantly made cloak, bow, and boots, a gift from the elf fastnesses of Southern Argollë, reveal Bodo’s success as an adventurer, explorer, and fortune hunter. Fair-minded, plain spoken, and gentle with animals and children, he is rarely encountered without being trailed by some bird or beast who has taken an interest in him. As for the humans within his domain, the small hamlet that has grown around his secluded mountain fort hold their lord in esteem. Rumors that he is a friend to murderous beasts who protect him and his lands only adds to his dangerous reputation.
