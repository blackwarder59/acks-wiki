# Chapter 14: Custom Spells

The original ***ACKS***spell creation system was first presented in ***ACKS Player’s Companion****.* That system was reverse-engineered from the existing canon of D20 fantasy spells in order to justify and explain the effects of the spells. Once the model was successfully fitted to the effects of existing spells, it became possible to create new spells that would be balanced against those that had already existed. From this arose the corpus of ***ACKS***spells that has been expanded throughout our later supplements.

The revised spell creation system here has been updated based on 10 years of gameplay since the original release. Because the original system was imputed from the existing canon of D20 fantasy spells, it had “baked in” certain assumptions that proved sub-optimal for long-term campaign play. The revised system presented in this chapter is, we believe, better balanced and more likely to produce the sort of gameplay that ***ACKS***players enjoy.

Using, these rules, you can re-create about 90% of the spells that appear in ***ACKS II***or make up new spells of your own. If there’s a spell you want to adapt from another game, you can probably do so following these rules, too. Sometimes, however, you’ll find If the system can’t create the sort of spell you want and you have to go beyond the rules here. When that happens, don’t stress about it – just call the spell “esoteric” and all is well.

With your permission, players engaged in spell research can make use of these rules to design their new spells; alternatively, you can have the player describe what he wants the spell to accomplish and use these rules to create it for him.
