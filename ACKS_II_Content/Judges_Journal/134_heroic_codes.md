## Heroic Codes

In heroic fantasy settings, adventurers might hold to a code of behaviorknown as a **heroic code**. Adhering to such codes is a mark of greatness and increases the hero’s fame and glory in the eyes of his people. In game terms, a character who behaves according to a heroic code for the course of the entire adventure gains a **10% bonus on experience earned** during that adventure.

Each heroic code is made up of eight virtues to which the character should aspire. The exact virtues recommended by the heroic code will depend on the hero’s culture. Below we present one possible heroic code, the **warrior code** of the pagan heroes of myth.

### Warrior Code

* **Courage:** Do not show fear or flee in the face of an enemy of equal or inferior strength. Orderly retreat in the face of an enemy of superior strength is acceptable if the consequences of retreat will not put others in jeopardy.
* **Hospitality:** Do not turn away a supplicant at your door. Provide food and shelter to any guest who asks it, even a sworn enemy, and ensure they do not come to harm while hosted in your home.
* **Reliability:** Do not break a sworn oath or promise.
* **Honesty:** Do not lie to friends, family, or strangers. Deception may be employed in war, or to make a point against those who have proved themselves dishonest, but not if doing so would break an oath.
* **Generosity:** Do not be miserly in gifts or words. Be generous to friends, family, and followers. Reward the loyal service of followers with gifts and praise.
* **Loyalty:** Do not allow others to harm your family, your friends, or your followers. If harmed, demand compensation for the harm from the wrongdoers. If compensation is not granted, take revenge for the harm against the wrongdoers.
* **Honor:** Do not allow others to accuse you of breaking the warrior code, nor give them cause to believe you would.
* **Ceremoniousness:** Uphold the traditions, law, and order of your or your lord’s realm.

The virtues within a code are always listed in order of importance. When contradictions arise in the heroic code, higher-order virtues generally take precedence over lower-order virtues. (By re-ordering the eight virtues, very different codes of behavior can be created.)

EXAMPLE: Sigwulf has sworn an oath to slay his brother’s murderer, Bjorn, on sight. Sigwulf is awakened one morning by Bjorn, crippled in battle, asking for refuge in Sigwulf’s home. Since hospitality takes precedence over reliability (not breaking an oath) and loyalty (taking revenge for his brother’s killing), Sigwulf extends the guest-rite to Bjorn.
