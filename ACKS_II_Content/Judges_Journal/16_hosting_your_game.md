## Hosting Your Game

Running an ***ACKS*** session, especially your first time, is hard, and a first-time Judge can quickly make a mess of things. On the other hand, a well-practiced and experienced Judge can make hosting an ***ACKS*** session seem easy; he knows all the secrets for gathering folks, getting them in the head space to game, and then running them through. Let's talk about what those secrets are.

### **When and Where**

One of the first challenges you face in deciding to host a session of ***ACKS***is determining when and how long you’ll play. The specific day is going to depend on your and your players’ schedules. With adult players, we generally have had the most success in getting groups to play on Mondays or Thursdays. By avoiding the precious weekend nights you take a lot of pressure off the participants.

After years of trying various patterns of play, we’ve found that a four- to five-hour session length is optimal. Four to five hours is, not coincidentally, about the length of dinner and a movie, a tailgate plus football game, or a concert plus drinks. If you play after work, it means you can start play at 7pm and wrap up before midnight, which fits comfortably into most people's after-work schedules.

For venue, a quiet room with comfortable seating and a large table is ideal. The best choice is your own home, provided you have a large enough table or living room. Of course, if one of the players has a dedicated game room where you can have rules and miniatures spread out, go with that. We generally recommend avoiding games in public places such as game stores or coffee shops unless you are extremely experienced. Such environments are usually loud and uncontrolled, which makes it hard for introverts to feel immersed and comfortable. That said, if you have a villainous roommate or live in a Tokyo sleep-coffin, it might be your best option.

An increasingly popular option today is to play online using a **virtual tabletop** (VTT). A virtual tabletop allows you to gather players from all around the world, perhaps uniting old friends to game together. If you’re going to play ***ACKS***on a VTT, we recommend using Foundry Virtual Tabletop. To coincide with ***ACKS II****,* we commissioned development of a full Foundry module that implements the mechanics of the game and incorporates a huge database of abilities, monsters, equipment, and more to call on.

Whatever you choose, it's best to find one venue for your campaign and stick with it. You can try to make a rotating venue (one in which each player hosts for a week, for instance) work, but beware that the “friction of war” will frequently cause tardy and lost players who end up at the wrong location.

### **Rewarding Refreshments**

Role-playing games are best enjoyed with food and drink. Every party's taste in refreshments will vary, of course, ranging from the traditional Mountain Dew and chips to fruit smoothies and diced vegetables, but your party can't be expected to defeat the dark lord on an empty stomach. Nor for that matter can you speak for five hours on a parched throat.

Here’s a simple technique to always ensure there's a large and varied supply of food and drink at each gaming session: offer a 5% bonus on earned experience points to players that bring munchies. To kick things off, you can even offer an additional bonus (+5% more) to whoever brings the best array of refreshments. It rewards pro-social behavior and encourages everyone to chip in.

One important note on refreshments: Beware the drunken gamer. Whether the party is attempting to role-play or devise battle tactics, a drunkard gets in the way and ruins the experience of the other players. While we keep beer on hand, we also maintain a hard and fast rule at our campaigns that anyone who gets drunk is ejected from play. We save our serious drinking for beer-and-pretzels board games, or visits to the local inns and taverns.

### **Running a Session**

With a half-dozen or so friends gathered around the table, gossip and small talk is a certainty. The players can easily chat away for hours and then complain that they didn't have enough time to play. It can seem rude or intimidating to interrupt everyone and demand their attention on Your Game, but that’s your job as Judge. Give everyone about 10 minutes to get settled, and then start the game. Having a routine to open each session really helps send the signal that it’s time to get started.

In our own campaigns, we usually open each session by playing some epic trailer music and giving a short recap of the prior session. The recap reminds everyone of what went on the last time we all gathered, and usually prompts roars of laughter, a lot of “oh that’s right,” and pledges of renewed vengeance or greed. After that, we quickly describe where the party is, and ask them what they want to do.

This technique, of describing the scene and then asking the players what they want to do, is one of the main tools in any gamemaster’s arsenal for maintaining the pace of the game. Plan to use it frequently over the next few hours. Anytime the players get bogged down arguing for more than 10 – 15 minutes, or seem like they are at a loss as to how to proceed, give them an updated summary of the situation at hand and ask them for their actions. It will usually trigger them to do something. Be sure to mention how long it’s been since the last update you provided, what people are currently doing, any objects they haven’t yet explored, and offer some sense that time is running out.

For example, consider the following description, offered to a party that isn’t sure what to do next: “OK, so you’ve been standing in the vampire’s tomb arguing in hushed whispers for the past ten minutes, unsure what to do. Viktir is lurking in the corner, while Marcus is eyeballing the exit. The black curtain still hangs across the south wall, covered with dust and cobwebs, untouched in centuries. In the distance you can now hear low groaning.” The party might decide to head for the exit, or check out the curtain, or get ready to fight whatever is groaning, but they’ll do something.

After about four hours of play, it’ll be time to wind the session down. When the session ends, if the party isn’t in a safe area, be sure to record how much damage they’ve suffered, what spell slots they’ve expended, and other notes on their condition — players are not very incentivized to remember such things, after all!

If possible, it’s courteous to maintain your scheduled duration as a hard deadline. The major exception to this rule is that you should try never to end a session in the middle of a fight — not only is it bad for immersion, it’s quite hard to keep track of the tactical details after a week. The ideal way to end the session is after a hard fight or dramatic encounter, about 10 – 15 minutes before everyone needs to head out. After a good game, there’s usually an enjoyable “post-game recap” where people discuss what happened. It’s fun to review your own game, and it’ll provide valuable insight to you as to what people most liked and disliked in the session.

With that, we’ve covered the basics!
