## Wilderness Expeditions

When your player characters have explored the dungeons near their starting location, they will begin to journey into the wilderness in search of further adventure. Wilderness adventurers are most common at mid-levels (3rd – 7th level), but the rules that follow can be used anytime the player characters venture into the wilds.

### Sequence of Play (Wilderness Expeditions)

When a wilderness expedition begins, gameplay is handled in increments of **game days** and **hours**. Each game day, the adventurers can undertake 1 dedicated activity (8 hours) and 4 ancillary activities (1 hour each).

1. **Determine Weather:** Determine the weather for the day (p. XX). If weather conditions are Frigid, Foggy, Muddy, Snowy, or Sweltering, expedition speed will be halved. If weather conditions are Flurry, Foggy, Rainy, Snowy, Sunbaked, Stormy, or Windy, penalties might apply to certain activities. Effects of multiple conditions are cumulative (***ACKS II RR****,* p. XX).
2. **Check for Starvation and Dehydration:** Check to see if any creatures on the expedition are starving or dehydrated. If so, starving creatures lose 1 CON and dehydrated creatures lose 1d6 CON (or 2d6 CON if weather conditions are Sweltering).
3. **Determine Activities:** Ask the party what dedicated and/or ancillary activities it plans to undertake. Determine marching order.
4. **Check for Daily Encounters:** If the party will be hunting or resting in unsettled territory, roll to see if any random encounters will occur that day. If a random encounter will occur, roll 1d12 to determine the hour of its occurrence.
5. **Check if the Party Gets Lost:** If the party will be traveling, check to see if the party avoids getting lost (***ACKS II RR***, p. XX). If it gets lost, determine the direction they will erroneously be traveling today.
6. **Adjudicate Each Hour:** For each of the 12 adventuring hours in the day, follow the steps below.
   1. *Check for Scheduled Encounter:* If a random encounter is scheduled to occur this hour, follow the encounter procedure (described below).
   2. *Adjudicate Special Activities:* If the party is undertaking any activities this hour other than hunting, foraging, traveling, resting, or searching, adjudicate them now.
   3. *Adjudicate Travel and Encounters:* If the party is traveling, adjust its position on your wilderness map based on one hour of travel in the appropriate direction. If this causes the party to enter a new hex, roll to see if a random encounter occurs. If an encounter occurs, follow the encounter procedure (below).
   4. *Adjudicate Searching:* If any adventurers in the party are searching a hex, roll to see if a random encounter occurs. If an encounter occurs, follow the encounter procedure (below). After the encounter (if any), is resolved, roll to see if their search finds any lairs.
   5. *Adjudicate Weather Effects.* If weather conditions are Frigid, check to see if any creature becomes hypothermic either from cold water or lack of protective clothing. Each hypothermic creature loses 1d3 CON now. If weather conditions are Sweltering, check to see if any creatures in heavy armor become fatigued now.
7. **Resolve Foraging and Hunting:** If any adventurers in the party foraged or hunted at any time during the day, roll to see if they found food, water, or firewood. If so, add the food and water to their available supplies of rations, and the firewood to their supplies.
8. **Consume Rations:** Mark off no, half, or full food ration and no, half, or full water ration for each creature on the expedition.
   1. If any underfed creature eats a full ration of food, the condition ends.
   2. If any starving creature eats a full ration of food, the condition ends and the creature becomes underfed.
   3. If any dehydrated creature drinks a full ration of water, the condition ends.
   4. If any creature has gone 2 consecutive days without food, or 5 consecutive days with an average of half rations, it becomes underfed.
   5. If any creature has been underfed for 5 days with no food, or for 10 days with an average of half rations, it becomes starving. If any creature has gone a day without water, or 2 days with an average of half water, it becomes dehydrated.
9. **Adjudicate Weather Effects:** Follow the steps below to resolve any additional weather effects.
   1. *Disease:* If any creature has suffered seven consecutive days of Frigid or Rainy weather, check to see if it catches a disease (10% chance). If so, resolve the disease using the rules on p. XX.
   2. *Hypothermia:* If any creature on the expedition was hypothermic or suffered cold damage in Frigid temperatures, check to see if they suffer Frostbite. If so, resolve its effects.
   3. *Mud:* If conditions were Drizzly for three consecutive days or Rainy today, grasslands and scrublands terrain become Muddy. If conditions were Cold, Frigid, or Sweltering today, or Moderate for seven days, the mud dries.
   4. *Snow:* If conditions were Flurry for three consecutive days or Snowy today, terrain becomes Snowy. If conditions were Sweltering today, or Moderate for the past seven days, the snow melts.
   5. *Sunburn:* If conditions were Sunbaked today, creatures that lacked protective clothing take 1 fire damage.
10. **Adjudicate Fatigue**: Check to see if any creatures on the expedition has undertaken six consecutive days of strenuous activity (or the equivalent thereof by force marching). If so, it becomes fatigued (***ACKS II*** *RR,* p. XX).
11. **Adjudicate Healing**: If any characters rested, they heal 1d3 hit points, or 2d3 hit points if under the care of a healer.
12. **Check for Nighttime Encounters**: If resting at night in Borderlands, Outland, or Unsettled territory, roll to see if any random encounters will occur that night. If a random encounter will occur, roll 1d12 to determine the hour of its occurrence and resolve it at that time.
13. **Advance Calendar:** Mark off 1 day of game time.

Do not feel strictly beholden to this sequence. Sometimes, to adjudicate the action, you’ll need to adjust the sequence of events, other times disregard it altogether. The sequence of play is just intended as a checklist, not a mandate from heaven.

### Weathering the Wilderness

The ***ACKS II******Revised Rulebook***presents a number of game mechanics related to weather, including various conditions (hot, cold, rainy, windy, etc.) and effects (hypothermia, frostbite, dehydration, etc.). What it does not provide are rules to generate the weather each day.

#### Weather Table

At the start of each game day of a wilderness expedition, you can determine the weather for the adventurers’ current 24-mile hex with three rolls of 2d6: a **temperature roll**, a **precipitation roll**, and a **wind roll**. Each roll is adjusted by a modifier between -11 and +9 depending on the climate of the hex. After making the roll, use the Daily Weather table below to determine the prevailing weather for the day. If the prevailing weather is **bold**, it affects gameplay as detailed in ***ACKS II******Revised Rulebook***. Otherwise, the prevailing weather has utility only in affecting your narration and, sometimes, adjusting what another condition means.

**Day/Night Cycle:** In most climates, the temperature modifier will be 1 or more points lower during the night. Keep the same roll you made for the day temperature and simply apply the new modifier, or you can re-roll.

**Fast Travel:** If the adventurers move at a speed that will carry them through two or more 24-mile hexes each day, you can either use the same roll or re-roll. If the hexes have the same climate, we recommend keeping the same roll, but if the climate has changed (e.g. the adventurers have moved into the rain shadow of a mountain) then re-roll.

**Precipitation:** If the Temperature is Cold or Frigid, then Drizzly precipitation creates Flurry conditions and Rainy precipitation creates **Snowy** conditions (which do). If the Wind is Still, then Drizzly precipitation creates Misty conditions (which have no game effect) and Rainy precipitation creates **Foggy** conditions (which do).

**Temperature:** If the daytime temperature modifier is +0 or less, use the first column of the table to determine the temperature for both day and night. If the daytime temperature modifier is +1 or more, use the second column.

|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Modifier** | **Temperature (+0 or less)** | **Temperature (+1 or more)** | **Precipitation** | **Wind** |

| **6** | Very Chilly (37 to 40 F) | Balmy (68 to 71 F) | Overcast | Gentle |
| **7** | Chilly (41 to 50 F) | Balmy (72 to 74 F) | **Drizzly** | Moderate |
| **8** | Chilly (51 to 55 F) | Balmy (75 to 79 F) | **Drizzly** | Moderate |
| **9** | Brisk (56 to 60 F) | Warm (80 to 82 F) | **Drizzly** | Moderate |
| **10** | Brisk (61 to 65 F) | Warm (83 to 86 F) | **Rainy** | Strong |
| **11** | Balmy (66 to 68 F) | Hot (87 to 90 F) | **Rainy** | Strong |
| **12** | Balmy (69 to 72 F) | Hot (91 to 94 F) | **Rainy** | Very Strong, **Windy** |
| **13** | - | **Sweltering** (95 to 99 F) | **Rainy** | Very Strong, **Windy** |
| **14** | - | **Sweltering** (100 to 104 F) | **Rainy** | Gale, **Stormy** |
| **15** | - | **Sweltering** (105 to 108 F) | **Rainy** | Gale, **Stormy** |
| **16** | - | **Sweltering** (109 to 112 F) | **Rainy** | Gale, **Stormy** |
| **17** | - | **Sweltering** (113 to 115 F) | **Rainy** | Gale, **Stormy** |
| **18** | - | **Sweltering** (116 to 120 F) | **Rainy** | Gale, **Stormy** |
| **19 or more** | - | **Sweltering** (121 F or more) | **Rainy** | Gale, **Stormy** |

#### Determining Weather Modifiers

The temperature, precipitation, and wind modifiers are determined by the season of the year cross-referenced against the climate of the region. Each climate is assigned a two- or three-digit climate code based on the Köppen Climate Classification system. If you are a worldbuilder by hobby, you’ll probably have worked out the climate for your entire continent and region. If not, you can use the Climate by Terrain table to decide which climate code to use based on how you’ve imagined the setting.

**Continental vs Temperate:** These climates are similar in that both occur at middle latitudes and both have four distinct seasons. However, continental climates occur in the interior of continents at middle latitudes, while temperate climates occur on the coasts of continents at middle latitudes.

EXAMPLE: It is spring in the Borderlands of Southern Argollë and the adventurers are just beginning a wilderness expedition. The Judge rolls for weather. The Borderlands has a Cfa climate, so the temperature modifier is +2 (day) and +0 (night); the Precipitation modifier is -2; and the wind modifier is 0.

First, the Judge rolls 2d6 for temperature and gets a 5. Since the daytime temperature modifier is +2, he consults the second column of the Daily Weather table, where a modified 7 results in Balmy temperatures of 72 to 74 F. The nighttime temperature modifier is +0, so he consults the first column of the Daily Weather table for the temperatures that night; with a result of 5, the night cools to Brisk (63 to 67 F).

Next the Judge rolls 2d6 for precipitation and gets an 11. This is modified to a 9 by the -2 precipitation modifier. Consulting the Daily Weather table, he sees that the precipitation is Drizzly.

Finally, the Judge rolls 2d6 for wind and gets a 4. Since the wind modifier is 0, the result is unmodified. Consulting the Daily Weather table, he sees that the wind is Still. Since the wind is Still, the Drizzly precipitation becomes Misty instead.

The Judge interprets these results contextually to mean that it’s a warm and hazy spring day that cools by nightfall with a frosty mist.

### Encounters in the Wilderness

When the characters are on an expedition in civilized, borderlands, outlands, or unsettled terrain they face the risk of wilderness encounters. Characters in urban settlements do not risk wilderness encounters but might face settlement encounters (p. XX).

#### Frequency of Encounter Throws

The frequency of wilderness encounter throws is determined by the activities of the characters and the classification of the terrain they occupy.

|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Activity** | **Civilized** | **Borderlands** | **Outlands** | **Unsettled** |
| Hunting | Once per attempt | Once per attempt | Once per attempt | Once per attempt |
| Managing Traps | None | None | Once per 6 traps | Once per 6 traps |
| Resting/Stationary (day) | None | None | None | Once per 12 hours |
| Resting/Stationary (night) | Once per 7 nights | Once per 3 nights | Once per 12 hours | Once per 12 hours |
| Searching | Once per hour | Once per hour | Once per hour | Once per hour |
| Traveling | Once per 6-mile hex | Once per 6-mile hex | Once per 6-mile hex | Once per 6-mile hex |

Encounter throws triggered by time are made when the time period begins. If an encounter is triggered, you can choose when it occurs or roll dice to randomly determine when with the week, day, night, and hour the encounter occurs. The following are the recommended rules from the Sequence of Campaign Play (p. XX):

* Roll 1d8 to determine the day of the week (re-rolling or choosing on an 8).
* Roll 1d12 to determine the hour of the day or night, counting from dawn and dusk respectively.
* Roll 1d6 to determine the turn of the hour.

Encounter throws triggered by hexes are made when the characters enter the hex. If an encounter is triggered, you can choose where it occurs or roll 1d6 to determine the number of miles into the hex that the encounter occurs.

#### Making Wilderness Encounter Throws

To make a wilderness encounter throw, follow these steps:

1. Roll 1d20 on the appropriate column of the Wilderness Encounters by Territory Classification table.
2. If the roll indicates a “Column Shift, Roll Again” result, shift one column right on the Wilderness Encounters by Territory Classifications table and roll again.
3. If the roll indicates a “No Encounter” result, there is no encounter.
4. If the roll indicates a “Civilized Encounter” result, roll 1d100 on the Civilized Encounter by Terrain Type table to find the type of creature encountered.
5. If the roll indicates a “Monster Encounter” result:
   1. Roll 1d20 on the Monster Rarity by Territory Classification table and consult the resulting sub-table for the terrain type.
   2. Roll 1d100 on the appropriate Monster Encounter by Terrain Type and Rarity to find the type of creature encountered.
6. If creatures have been encountered in steps 4 or 5:
   1. Find the encountered creature’s entry in the ***ACKS II******Monstrous Manual***and roll against its **Lair** characteristic to determine whether the creature is in its lair. (If the creature is in its lair, a **dynamic lair** can be used if one is available).
   2. Roll the appropriate **number encountered** for the creature to determine how many are present.
   3. Roll on the Wilderness Encounter Distance table to randomly determine the maximum encounter distance in feet at the start of the encounter. The encounter will then occur at either the maximum encounter distance or the maximum visibility distance (p. XX), whichever is less. If the creature is in its lair, the encounter distance is the distance to the lair. If the creature is outside its lair, the encounter distance is the distance to the creature.
   4. Check for surprise and evasion, where necessary, and then proceed to reactions or combat.
7. If the roll indicates a “Terrain Encounter” result, treat it as a result of “No Encounter” if the party is resting/stationary or have specified they are following a specific route they have already traversed. Otherwise, roll 1d12 on the appropriate Terrain Encounter sub-table to determine the type of terrain encountered.

The results of rolls on the Wilderness Counter tables and sub-tables should always be handled in a fashion that makes sense in the context of the terrain, weather, time of year, and other factors. If necessary to maintain the verisimilitude of the setting, disregard the result and roll again.

Roll 1d20 on the appropriate column of the Wilderness Encounters by Territory Classification table. If the party is traveling along a road or a navigable river, be sure to use the “+ Road” column for the territory class. If the party is traveling at night in civilized, borderlands, our outlands territory, shift one column to the right.

**Designer’s Note:** When the adventurers are “hex crawling,” you will be making one encounter throw per hex they enter. In such cases, it often makes sense to pre-determine the results of a number of encounter throws before the session and put them into a numbered sequence. As the adventurers travel across the hexes and trigger encounter throws, you can just check off an encounter throw from your sequence. We use this method in our home games to speed play!

#### Civilized Encounters

Civilized encounters can confront the adventurers with domesticated animals, local residents, travelers, and even the occasional disguised monster. Roll 1d100 on the Civilized Encounter by Terrain Type table to find the type of creature encountered.

#### Monster Encounters

Monster encounters can confront the party with anything from a hungry black bear to an ancient dragon on the hunt. The farther the party travels from civilization, the more likely the party is to face rare and dangerous monsters.

###### Monster Rarity by Terrain Classification

Roll 1d20 and cross-reference the result with the territory classification on the Monster Rarity by Terrain Classification table. After determining whether the monster encountered is common, uncommon, rare, or very rare, proceed to the appropriate Monster Encounter by Terrain Type and Rarity sub-table.

| Rare | 20 | 19-20 | 16-19 | 15-18 |
| Very Rare | - | - | 20 | 19-20 |

###### Monster Encounters by Terrain Type and Rarity

Some monsters are common in every type of terrain. Others are common in some types of terrain but rare in others. The most powerful monsters tend to be rare or very rare even in their preferred terrain. Roll 1d20 and cross-reference the result with the terrain type on the appropriate Monster Encounter by Terrain Type and Rarity table. Note that in some cases, there are sub-types of terrain that reflect different weather biomes.

\*The Swamp encounter table is inspired by the Nile Delta and Mesopotamian Marsh. In the Auran Empire, the wetlands of Aurëpos are Swamp terrain. The names in parentheses specify the specific species of certain animals. An \* indicates that the creature is a cosmetic replacement for one found in the ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual***, meant to better reflect the species and sub-species common in this region:

* The asp has the characteristics of the viper.
* The black fly, dragonfly, and mosquito swarms are all types of insect swarms.
* The forest cobra has the characteristics of the spitting cobra.
* The green mamba has the characteristics of the king cobra.

#### Terrain Encounters

While monster encounters put the adventurers face to face with dangerous monsters, terrain encounters present an altogether different sort of challenge. Adventurers might discover places of great natural beauty, be confronted by ancient mysteries, come upon horrible scenes of destruction, or even encounter terrain so difficult to traverse they are forced to turn back.

There are three types of terrain encounters – valuable, dangerous, and unique. The type of terrain encounter that confronts the characters is determined by the result of the encounter throw. Remember, terrain encounters do not occur if the party is resting/stationary or have specified they are following a specific route they have already traversed.

###### Treasure Types

When any sub-table result directs a roll for Treasure Type by Terrain, roll using the treasure type indicated by this table.

###### Valuable Terrain Encounters

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Valuable Terrain (1d12)** | |
| **1** | Cache |
| **2** | Food |
| **3** | Fountain |
| **4** | Hidden Settlement |
| **5** | Monster Carcass |
| **6** | Ore |
| **7** | Ruin |
| **8** | Safe Haven |
| **9** | Shortcut |
| **10** | Useful Herbs |
| **11** | Vista |
| **12** | Double |

**Cache:** The adventurers find a hidden stash of loot or other unguarded treasure. Roll for treasure as per the Treasure Type by Terrain table. You can substitute special treasures for some or all of the treasure if desired, in order to place caches of resources rather than coin.

**Food:** The adventurers find an easily-accessible source of food; perhaps the adventurers found a fruit grove, a deer leapt across their path, or they stumbled upon a patch of delicious mushrooms. Regardless of the source, it offers the party 4d10 x 2 pounds of standard rations. Remember that 2 pounds of rations are sufficient to feed one person for one day. One week of rations weighs 1 stone.

**Fountain:** The adventurers discover a source of fresh potable water such as a lagoon, pond, spring, stream, or oasis. Regardless of the source, the fountain can provide 50 gallons of water each day, enough for one platoon of 15 cavalry and mounts or one company of 120 infantry to stay hydrated for one day. Replenishing from the fountain is an incidental activity (e.g. it takes less than a turn).

**Hidden Settlement:** The adventurers find a concealed lair of nonbelligerent creatures. Roll on the Monster Encounter table for the terrain to discover what type of creatures live there. Regardless of the result, the creatures will not be actively hostile. (If they are unintelligent, they may simply not mind the party's presence; if they are Chaotic, they may be hiding and just want to be left alone. The details of why this particular group is not actively hostile are left to you to decide.) A hidden settlement of intelligent creatures may be treated as a Class VI market with only half the normal number of items available (rounded up).

**Monster Carcass:** The adventurers find a dead monster or monsters. Roll on the Monster Encounter table for the terrain to determine the type of creature(s). The adventurers find the result rolled dead in their path. The corpse’s age in days is 1d4 divided by the terrain movement modifier for the hex. For example, in a desert (x2/3), it is from 1.5 to 6 days old, while on a road (x3/2), it is from 16 hours to 2.5 days old. The monster will have salvageable parts as per ***ACKS Lairs & Encounters*** *or* ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual***.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **1d100** | **Ore** |
| 01-35 | Stone |
| 36-75 | Iron |
| 76-95 | Copper |
| 96-97 | Silver-lead |
| 98-99 | Gemstone |
| 100 | Gold |

**Ore:** The adventurers stumble upon a visible deposit of ore. Roll on the table below to determine the type of ore they’ve discovered. Characters proficient in Land Surveying or Prospecting can automatically identify the ore for what it is on sight. Other characters must stop for 6 turns (1 hour) to investigate the site and succeed on an Adventuring proficiency throw of 18+ to identify the ore. This ore can be mined using the rules in ***By This Ax****e* or ***Axioms Compendium 9-16****.* If you’re not using those rules, then the deposit increases the land value of the hex by +1 if it contains stone, iron, copper, or silver-lead (to a minimum of 5), and by +2 if it contains gemstones or gold (to a minimum of 7).

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Terrain** | **Modifier** |
| Clear, Grass, Scrub | 0 |
| Hills, Mountains, Woods, River | +2 |
| Jungle, Swamp, Ocean, Desert, Barren | +4 |

**Ruin:** The adventurers find an abandoned, unoccupied structure of some kind. Roll 1d20 on the Structure Type table. The structure is damaged, but could be repaired. To find the ruin’s value, roll 1d12 and add a modifier as indicated by terrain type.

The ruin has an initial value of 39,000 gp plus another 2,000 gp times the result of your roll. Of course, these ruins are not in pristine shape; they wouldn't be ruins if they were! The more wild and less settled the terrain, the more likely the ruin is to be horrifically decayed. Roll 2d10 and subtract twice the terrain modifier listed above to determine what percentage of the ruin's value has survived, to a minimum of 1%. At your discretion, round this value to the nearest 5%.

EXAMPLE: The adventurers have discovered a ruin in a swamp hex. The Judge rolls 16 on the Structure table, so the ruin is a temple. To determine the temple’s initial value, the Judge rolls a 3 on 1d12, and adds +4 because the temple is in a swamp, for a result of 7. Therefore the temple’s initial value was 39,000 + (2,000gp x 7) = 53,000 gp. The Judge then rolls to determine the percentage of value remaining. He rolls a 13, so the temple retains [13 – (2 x 4)] 5% of its original value. The ruined temple is worth 2,650gp.

**Safe Haven:** The adventurers find a hidden, guarded, or otherwise especially safe location. While resting here, the adventurers will not be discovered by any random encounters, though the adventurers may be followed into the safe haven if they attempt to escape into it. Choose or roll 1d10 on the Safe Haven table to determine the nature of the haven.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Safe Haven (1d10)** | |
| **1** | A talus cave on a rocky slope. |
| **2** | A forested dell hidden by fells that flank it on either side. |
| **3** | A rocky ledge inaccessible except by one easily-guarded route. |
| **4** | A meadow surrounded by a nigh-impenetrable thicket of thorny briar. |
| **5** | A clearing concealed by a dense grove of trees. |
| **6** | A deep gully with high sides. |
| **7** | A narrow crevice with rocky overhangs. |
| **8** | An abandoned cabin, hut, or tree house. |
| **9** | An abandoned warren with underground tunnels dug by giant varmints. |
| **10** | A limestone cave with a grotto. |

**Shortcut:** The adventurers find a shortcut. Draw a line from the face of the hex the adventurers entered from, to the face of the hex the adventurers leave through, along the direction of their travel. When traveling between these faces, the adventurers may treat the hex as having no modifier to travel speed. If the hex's terrain already gave no modifier, the adventurers may treat it as a road instead. (At your discretion, to simplify, these effects can be applied when the adventurers travel through the hex in any direction instead of only along their original axis of travel.)

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Useful Herbs (1d12)** | |
| **1** | Belladonna |
| **2** | Birthwort |
| **3** | Comfrey |
| **4** | Garlic |
| **5** | Goldenrod |
| **6** | Wolfsbane |
| **7** | Woundwort |
| **8** | Aloe |
| **9** | Bitterwood |
| **10** | Horsetail |
| **11** | Lungwort |
| **12** | Willow-bark |

**Useful Herbs:** The adventurers happen upon a field where healing herbs grow. Roll on the useful herbs table, below, to determine what the adventurers found. A character with Naturalism proficiency (or another appropriate proficiency) can identify the find with a proficiency throw of 11+. If correctly identified, the herbs can be harvested. There will be 2d100 lbs of herbs. Harvesting the herbs takes 1 turn per 5 lbs. (Harvesting 180 lbs of herbs counts as a dedicated strenuous activity, e.g. 180 lbs in 6 hours.) Each pound counts as one item for encumbrance purposes.

**Vista:** The adventurers find a place with a fantastic view of the surrounding terrain. Maximum visibility distance and encounter distance are doubled from the vista. In addition to being an exemplar of natural beauty, suitable for construction of an elven fastness, it offers an excellent strategic command post. If an army occupies the vista it gains a +1 bonus on reconnaissance rolls. If the army fights a battle while defending the vista, each commander in the army gains a bonus of 1d3 points to their Strategic Ability.

**Double:** Roll twice on this table. If either or both rolls are 'double', again, roll on the Unique Terrain table instead. If neither reroll is 'double', the adventurers find both indicated valuable terrain pieces. (The adventurers cannot find one Unique and one Valuable. For instance, if the rerolls are 12 and 3, you find only a piece of unique terrain, not a piece of unique terrain and a cache.)

###### Dangerous Terrain Encounters

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Dangerous Terrain (1d12)** | |
| **1** | Awful Despoiling |
| **2** | Challenge |
| **3** | Enshrouding Terrain |
| **4** | Foul Fountain |
| **5** | Hazard |
| **6** | Plague |
| **7** | Poison |
| **8** | Rough Going |
| **9** | Spoilage |
| **10** | Trap |
| **11** | Wasteland |
| **12** | Double |

**Awful Despoiling:** Roll once on the Valuable Terrain table. The adventurers find that result, but despoiled, desecrated, or otherwise destroyed. It’s up to you to decide what despoiled the terrain based on e.g. nearby monster lairs or other points of interest. A thorough search of the despoiled area requires 6 turns (one hour) and might reveal clues as to its cause on a successful Searching proficiency throw. However, the scene is so terrible that requesting hirelings to enter the despoiled area requires a Hireling Obedience roll.

**Challenge:** The adventurers run across a natural obstacle that challenges their adventuring skills. Choose or roll on the Challenge Type table to determine the nature of the challenge. The obstacles listed for each challenge are just examples; you should decide the exact nature of the obstacle based on the terrain, weather, and other circumstances.

The challenges posed by terrain encounters can be met by using the rules for balancing, climbing, crawling, rappelling, or squeezing in the ***ACKS II******Revised Rulebook*** or by other means (magical or mundane) that the players might devise. If the adventurers want to bypass the challenge, roll 1d12. On 1-8, it takes that many hours of backtracking to find a bypass. On a 9-10 there is no way to bypass the obstacle in this hex. In either case, roll for another encounter throw.

EXAMPLE: A party has been moving through the Jutting Mountains in winter. They have just entered a mountains hex when an obstacle is rolled. The Judge rolls 1d10 an gets a 3, indicating an easy climb of 1d6! x 100’ height. He rolls a 3, indicating 300’. The Judge decides that the mountain trail the party has been following has been blocked by a 300’ tall avalanche, forming a mound of slush, snow, and rock they have to scramble up.

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Challenge Type** | | |  |
| **Die Roll** | **Challenge** | **Example Obstacle** | **Dimensions** |
| 1 | Balancing Traverse (narrow) | Broken rope-bridge across ravine | 1d4+4” width, 1d6! x 100’ length, 1d6! x 100’ high |
| 2 | Balancing Traverse (precarious) | Precarious ledge along a cliff face | 1d4/2” width, 1d6 x 100’ length, 1d6! x 100’ high |
| 3 | Climbing (easy) | Rocky, scrambling ascent up a hill | 1d6! x 100’ height |
| 4 | Climbing (sheer) | Sheer ascent of cliff or mountain | 1d6! x 100’ height |
| 5 | Crawling Traverse | Chasm, gap, or ravine | 1d6! x 100’ height |
| 6 | Crawling Traverse or Jumping | Boulders over lava | 1d10 platforms, 3d10’ diameter, 3d10’ apart |
| 7 | Climbing (easy) or Rappeling | Scrambling descent down slope | 1d6! x 100’ height |
| 8 | Climbing (sheer) or Rappeling | Sheer descent down cliff | 1d6! x 100’ length |
| 9 | Squeezing | Crevice, fissure, or slot canyon | 1d2’ width, 1d6! x 40’ length |
| 10 | Swimming or Crawling Traverse | Unfordable waters | 1d6! x 40’ width, -1d3 penalty to Swimming throws |

**Enshrouding Terrain:** The adventurers enter terrain that makes it very difficult to see what is going on, such as a deep valley surrounded on all sides by forest. Maximum visibility distance and encounter distance are halved within the enshrouding terrain. If an army occupies the enshrouding terrain, it suffers a -1 penalty to its reconnaissance rolls; conversely, opposing armies suffer a -1 penalty to reconnaissance rolls to detect it. If an army is engaged in a battle within the enshrouding terrain, it has trouble controlling its troops. Each commander in such an army suffers a 1d3 point penalty to their Strategic Ability and Leadership Ability. The penalties can be identical or different (at your discretion).

**Foul Fountain:** The adventurers discover a source of fresh water such as a lagoon, pond, spring, stream, or oasis. Regardless of the source, the fountain can provide 50 gallons of water, enough for one platoon of 15 cavalry and mounts or one company of 120 infantry to stay hydrated for one day. Replenishing from the fountain is an incidental activity (e.g. it takes less than a turn). However, the water is foul and unsafe. Characters who drink the water without taking appropriate precautions (such as boiling it or casting *purify food and water*)become **incapacitated** 1d6 hours later with upset bowels, dysentery, and vomiting. The condition lasts one day, at the end of which the character becomes **dehydrated**. There is a 10% chance a character drinking foul water is affected by a disease (see Plague, below).

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Hazard Type** | | |
| **Die Roll** | **Hazard** | **Trap Equivalent** |
| 1 | Avalanche/Rockslide | Rolling Rock Trap |
| 2 | Brittle Ledges | Rock-Cut Pit Trap |
| 3 | Falling Rocks | Ceiling Collapse Trap |
| 4 | Hot Geysers/Vents | Fire Trap |
| 5 | Hidden Crevices/Sinkholes | Excavated Earth Pit |
| 6 | Rotten Collapse-Prone Trees | Swinging Log Trap |

**Hazard:** The adventurers arrive at a place of hidden danger. The hazard is the equivalent of a 5th level dungeon trap (see p. XX), albeit of natural rather than mechanical nature. To determine the nature of the hazard, roll 1d6 on the Hazard Type table; alternatively devise your own! If any adventurers in the party are proficient in Land Surveying, roll to see if they hastily detect the hazard. If not, then roll 1d6 for each adventurer in the appropriate order given the party’s marching formation to see if they trigger the hazard. On a roll of 1-2, the adventurer has accidentally triggered the hazard. On a roll of 3-6, the adventurer has accidentally bypassed the hazard entirely. Depending on its rolls, the party might immediately discover the hazard, accidentally bypass it, or be caught mid-formation. Hazards cannot be “disarmed” but can be bypassed. If the adventurers want to bypass the hazard, roll 1d12. On 1-8, it takes that many hours of backtracking. On a 9-12 there is no way to bypass the hazard in this hex. In either case, roll another encounter throw.

**Plague:** The party is exposed to a disease of some sort. When this occurs, the type of disease is determined with a roll of 1d100 on the Disease Type table. Subtract 10 if the party is in a swamp or jungle hex, and add 10 if the party is in a clear, glass, or scrublands hex. Once the disease is identified, each adventurer, follower, henchman, hireling, or other humanoid in the party must make a Death saving throw to see if he becomes infected. (If the party is reinforced with numerous followers or hirelings, you can roll once for each group of 30 followers or hirelings.) See Diseases on p. XX for more details.

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **(1d20)** | **Poison** | **Target** |
| 1 | 3d10 doses of yew | 4+ |
| 2 | 3d10 doses of pit viper venom | 11+ |
| 3 | 4d6 doses of hellebore | 8+ |
| 4 | 4d6 doses of hemlock | 8+ |
| 5 | 2d10 doses of giant killer bee venom | 11+ |
| 6 | 2d10 doses of carcass scavenger venom | 11+ |
| 7 | 3d6 doses of foxglove | 14+ |
| 8 | 3d6 doses of sea snake venom | 11+ |
| 9 | 3d6 doses of giant black widow venom | 11+ |
| 10 | 3d6 doses of giant rattlesnake venom | 11+ |
| 11 | 2d6+1 doses of belladonna | 11+ |
| 12 | 2d6+1 doses of henbane | 8+ |
| 13 | 2d6+1 doses of wolfsbane | 11+ |
| 14 | 2d6+1 doses of giant tarantula venom | 11+ |
| 15 | 2d6+1 doses of giant scorpion venom | 11+ |
| 16 | 2d4 doses of rockfish venom | 11+ |
| 17 | 2d4 doses of wyvern venom | 11+ |
| 18 | 1d3 doses of curare | 20+ |
| 19 | 1d3 doses of purple worm venom | 11+ |
| 20 | 1d3 doses of dragon blood | 11+ |

**Poison:** The adventurers find something poisonous. Roll on the Poisons table to determine what type of poison was found in what quantity. The poison may be disguised, and appear to be useful herbs or other valuable commodity. A character with Naturalism proficiency (or another appropriate proficiency) can identify the find with a proficiency throw of 11+. However, if the find is probed without proper caution, the adventurer is exposed to the poison and must succeed on a Death saving throw or suffer its effects.

If correctly identified, the poison can be harvested. Harvesting poison properly requires a Naturalism proficiency throw for a plant toxin or an Animal Husbandry proficiency throw for a creature venom. In either case, the required target value is listed on the adjoining table. On a roll of an unmodified 1, the gatherer has been exposed to the poison, and must succeed on a Death save or suffer its effects. Harvesting the poison takes 1 turn per dose. (Harvesting 6 doses of poison counts as a minor strenuous activity.) Doubling the harvest time increases the proficiency throw by +4, tripling it increases the proficiency throw by +8. Each dose harvested counts as one item for encumbrance purposes.

**Rough Going:** The hex is more difficult to traverse than is typical given the terrain type. There is no particular challenge that can be overcome nor is there any specific danger or hazard that can be bypassed, it simply is just rough going. All speeds are reduced by ½ in this hex.

**Spoilage:** Some event or terrain feature (a wagon throwing an axle, a horse throwing a hoof, a bag falling into the swamp, etc.) causes the adventurers to lose stored rations. Their expedition loses 1d8 x 5% of its stored rations.

**Trap:** The adventurers encounter a trap set in the wilderness. Determine the trap as if it were placed in the 5th level of a dungeon (see p. XX). If any adventurers in the party are proficient in Searching or Trapping, roll to see if they hastily detect the trap. If not, then roll 1d6 for each adventurer in the appropriate order given the party’s marching formation to see if they trigger it. On a roll of 1-2, the adventurer has accidentally activated the trap. On a roll of 3-6, the adventurer has accidentally missed the trap entirely and it remains inactivated. Depending on the result of these rolls, the party might immediately discover the trap, accidentally bypass it, or be caught mid-formation. 15% of traps guard treasure; if this trap guards treasure, determine the treasure type as per Cache by consulting the Treasure Type by Terrain table.

**Wasteland:** The hex is dead and barren. Reduce its Land Value by 1, to a minimum of 3. This result stacks if rolled multiple times in the same hex. For each wasteland hex that the party enters during a day, they suffer a -2 penalty to foraging throws that day.

**Double:** Roll twice on this table. If either or both rolls are 'double', again, roll on Unique Terrain instead. If neither reroll is 'double', the adventurers find both indicated dangerous terrain pieces. The adventurers cannot find one Unique and one Dangerous. For instance, if the rerolls are 12 and 3, the adventurers find only a piece of unique terrain, not a piece of unique terrain and a quagmire.)

###### Unique Terrain Encounters

| **1** | K | 5,000 gp average value |
| **2** | L, J | 10,000 gp average value |
| **3** | P | 17,000 gp average value |
| **4** | Q | 22,000 gp average value |
| **5** | Ox2 | 24,000 gp average value |
| **6** | Q, N | 31,000 gp average value |

**Complex Map:** The adventurers find a location that is in itself a treasure map. An example might look similar to Stonehenge. It can be difficult to decipher the map, or even to learn that it is a map at all. If deciphered, it leads to a treasure. The treasure is 1 hex away per 1,000 gp value (you can use the average value and roll the actual contents of the treasure later). Roll 1d6 to determine the treasure type the map points to.

**Curse:** The adventurers find a cursed place or object. Roll on the Curse table to get some idea of what sort of curse has been found, and how it may affect the party. Some of the curses on the Curse table reflect their transmission or methodology, while others suggest what penalty the curse inflicts. If a penalty is not suggested, use the *bestow curse* spell as a starting point, or use any curse you have in mind.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Curse (1d10)** | |
| **1** | *Infectious:* The curse is infectious in some fashion. |
| **2** | *Transformational:* The curse transforms its victims. |
| **3** | *Intermittent:* The curse applies only at specific times. |
| **4** | *Devastating:* The effect of the curse is greater than normal. |
| **5** | *Horrifying:* The curse makes the victim fearsome to their allies. |
| **6** | *Confusing:* The curse affects the victim's thought patterns. |
| **7** | *Forgetful:* The curse affects the victim's memory. |
| **8** | *Enfeebling:* The curse affects the victim's physical attributes. |
| **9** | *Locational:* The curse affects the location, rather than specific victims. |
| **10** | *Object:* The curse is tied to an object, and affects its bearers or wielders. |

**Empowering Place:** The adventurers find a place capable of temporarily empowering non-magical items with the powers of a magical item. Choose or roll a magic item that the place is capable of duplicating, then choose a method by which the terrain can deliver this power. (For example, a cliff might empower the boots of someone who leaps off it with the powers of *boots of levitation*.) Only a non-magical item may be empowered, and only one such item may be empowered at a time. The empowered item will serve as the magical item for 1d6 days, but will then be destroyed. (It does not merely become nonmagical; the physical item is destroyed.) At your discretion, roll on the Structure table when placing an empowering place.

**Lesser Terrain:** The adventurers find something that appears unique at first, but turns out not to be. Roll on the Valuable or Dangerous terrain tables instead (50% chance of either). The terrain found will appear more fantastic than usual, but will function as normal.

**Magical Place:** The adventurers find a place that is capable of duplicating the effect of a spell of some kind. Choose or roll the source of the magic, then choose or roll a spell from the spell list. A good default method is to roll as if it were a scroll (p. XX). Finally, choose a method by which this place can duplicate the spell. The place is capable of creating the spell effect with a frequency determined by the level of spell, but never more often than once per day per target.

* *1st level:* 5/day
* *2nd level:* 3/day
* *3rd level:* 1/day
* *4th level:* 1/week
* *5th level:* 1/month
* *6th level:* 1/year
* *7th level and higher:* 1/decade or longer. (Ritual spells do not normally appear at these locations, but this suggested frequency is included should you decide to place one.)

At your option, you can roll on the Structure table when placing a magical place.

EXAMPLE: The party is exploring the Istrith Forest when the Judge rolls a magical place encounter. He rolls randomly to determine the spell as if it were a scroll, and the result is *restore life and limb*. Since *restore life and limb* is a 5th level spell, the magic place can cast it once per month. The Judge decides the magic place is a pool which casts *restore life and limb* on the first corpse placed within it on the first night of the new moon. He rolls 1d20 on the Structures table and the result is 11 – a monument. He decides that the ancient elves have erected a great menhir here, carved with pigmented paintings depicting the phases of the moon.

**Magical Resource:** The adventurers find a naturally-occurring magical resource. Treat as a special component or magical compound of your choice (or roll on the encounter table to find out what creature it counts as a component from). The magical resource does not require metamphora to store. It weighs 1 stone per 10 gp value and the adventurers find an amount worth 3d6 x 1,000gp. It takes one character an hour (one ancillary activity) to harvest 1,000gp worth of resources. If the party returns later, they will find that more has grown; you can assign a growth rate (a reasonable average is approximately 33 months to restore the full amount) or reroll its value.

**Monstrous Shadow:** A nearby terrible monster casts a shadow over the area (or brightens the area, if the monster is Lawful). Roll a monster encounter for the terrain to determine the type of terrible monster. If the encounter includes multiple monsters, only one of them is the terrible monster, and it leads the others. The terrible monster is always in a lair - even if its type does not normally make lairs. If the terrible monster has less than 11 HD, increase its HD to 11 as a result of the powers it has been infused with. For each HD of increase, the monster’s AC improves by 1 and the monster deals an average of 2 hp more damage divided among all its attacks. Increase the monster's size by one category, to a minimum of Large (ogre-sized). If its alignment is Neutral, change it to Chaotic. The terrible monster’s lair is a shadowed (minor) sinkhole of evil (or equivalent pinnacle of good, if Lawful). If it is slain, the sinkhole of evil (or pinnacle of good) will disperse in 1d4 days. The creature rarely goes far from its lair, but otherwise acts as normal for a creature of its type. The lair will have normal treasure for the monster’s type, plus additional treasure by terrain type.

EXAMPLE: When the adventurers enter a mountains hex, the Judge rolls a Monstrous Shadow result. He refers to the random encounter table for mountains terrain, and rolls a result of wyverns. Wyverns are encountered in aeries of 1d6, so he rolls 1d6 to determine the number of wyverns present. The result is 3, so three wyverns are present, one of which is the terrible monster. Wyverns are 7 HD monsters, so the terrible wyvern is increased to 11 HD. It gains a +2 bonus to AC (from 6 to 8) and adds 8 additional points of damage across its two attacks; the Judge decides its talons deal 3d8/3d8 rather than 2d8/2d8. The terrible wyvern’s aerie has treasure type M (typical for wyverns) plus N, D (from the Treasure Type by Terrain table).

**Place of Power:** The adventurers find a place of power of some kind. Roll to determine the type and power. You can also roll on the Structure table when placing a place of power to reflect past habitation of the place.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Type (1d10)** | |
| **1-4** | Sinkhole of evil |
| **5-6** | Pinnacle of good |
| **7** | Aerie of elemental air |
| **8** | Edifice of elemental earth |
| **9** | Furnace of elemental fire |
| **10** | Well of elemental water |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Power (1d12)** | |
| **1-11** | Minor |
| **12** | Roll again on the Major Power Table |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Major Power (1d12)** | |
| **1-11** | Major |
| **12** | Supreme |

**Portal:** The adventurers find a portal linking two locations. he portal might transfer only sensory information (sight and/or sound), or might allow travel through it. The portal might be always active, or might be limited in some fashion (such as functioning only during an eclipse). A portal that allows travel is always limited in some fashion (though a portal might be always active for sight and/or sound, but allow travel only in limited circumstances). You should choose a location for the other end of the portal that is appropriate for your setting. Note that the two ends of the portal can have different conditions for when they activate – for instance, one end could activate during a lunar eclipse while the other end activates during a solar eclipse – and the other end is not guaranteed to be a safe destination, making travel through an unknown portal extremely dangerous. At your discretion, the portal link might manifest in other ways than an actual portal (such as treating the two locations as the same for the purposes of spellcasting range).

**Relic:** The adventurers find a relic of a time long gone. The relic is not necessarily magical, but is valuable. Roll as for a Regalia (1d100+80 on the Jewelry Value table in Chapter 4) to determine its value. 25% of relics are also magical (choose or roll a magic item of at least rare quality); of those that are magical, 10% are cursed (Judge’s choice). For every 1,000gp of value, the relic has a 5% chance to be guarded by a monster or monsters with XP value equal to one-fourth its value.

**Truly Unique:** The adventurers find something truly unique. This category is a catch-all for anything you want to place in the hex (for instance, something you saw in a third-party product and thought was awesome). If you (justifiably) feel that the point of a random table is to keep from having to invent things whole cloth like this, choose another result or reroll!

**Double:** Roll twice and combine the results, which may be a single terrain feature with two powers or two different terrain features, at your discretion. If the result is rolled again, ignore it and reroll (there cannot be more than two Unique effects in a hex).

### Clearing the Wilderness

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Lairs per Hex** | |
| **Terrain Type** | **Lairs** |
| Barrens (any) | 1d4 |
| Desert (rocky) | 1d2 |
| Desert (sandy) | 1d4 |
| Forest (any) | 2d4 |
| Grassland (farm/prairie) | 1d3 |
| Grassland (steppe) | 1d3-1 |
| Hills (forested) | 2d4 |
| Hills (rocky) | 1d4 |
| Jungle | 2d8 |
| Mountains (forested) | 2d4 |
| Mountains (rocky/snowy) | 1d4+1 |
| Scrubland (low, sparse) | 1d2 |
| Scrubland (high, dense) | 2d4 |
| Swamp (any) | 2d4+1 |

Adventurers who seek to establish their own domains in unsettled territory must enter the area with other adventurers or mercenaries and drive off, kill, or pacify any monsters that dwell there. The larger the territory, the more challenging it is to clear it. Even a single 6-mile hex is an extensive tract of land: 31 square miles, or about 24,000 acres. A hex can support a considerable number of peasants when settled – and a considerable number of monster lairs when unsettled.

As Judge, you cannot (and should not) attempt to place every lair in every hex in advance. Your regional map would soon be filled to the brim with bear dens, rat nests, and other commonplace lairs, most of which will go undiscovered and unused. Instead, you should place lairs only when the adventurers decide to begin clearing hexes, either during prep before the session or dynamically during the session.

You can quickly determine the number and type of lairs in a hex by following these steps:

1. Consult the Lairs per Hex table and find the terrain type that best matches the terrain in the hex. Roll the listed dice to determine how many lairs are present.
2. For each lair, roll 1d20 on the Monster Rarity by Territory Classification table and consult the resulting sub-table for the terrain type. Then Roll 1d20 on the appropriate Monster Encounter by Terrain Type and Rarity to determine the monster in that lair.
3. Build the lair using the ***ACKS II******Monstrous Manual*** or use a pre-existing lair from ***Lairs & Encounters***or other published sourcebooks.

Most wilderness hexes will have two to six lairs. Lairs will be more densely packed in rough terrain that provides lots of cover, vegetation, and water (such as jungles and swamps) and less densely packed in open terrain with long lines of sight, sparse vegetation, and limited water (such as deserts and grasslands).

#### Replacing Lairs with Terrain Encounters (Optional)

When stocking hexes, you can substitute terrain encounters for up to 50% of the monster lairs. To do this randomly, roll 1d10 for each lair: 1-5, monster lair; 6-7: valuable terrain; 8-9, dangerous terrain; 10, unique terrain. To place terrain encounters, follow the steps outlined in p. XX of this chapter. You can also substitute a pre-planned point of interest for one or more monster lairs.

EXAMPLE: At the end of last session, the party decided its next expedition would be to clear the small forest nearby (3 6-mile hexes) in order to build a border fort there for the party’s explorer. For each of the three hexes, the Judge rolls 2d4 to determine the number of lairs. His rolls indicate there are 6 lairs in the first forest hex, 5 in the second forest hex, and 2 in the third forest hex.

He decides it would be interesting to have some terrain encounters mixed in with the monster lairs in the first hex. For each of the 6 lairs, he rolls 1d10. His results are 5, 1, 9, 7, 4, 6. Therefore there are three monster lairs (from the rolls of 5, 1, and 4), two valuable terrain encounters (from the rolls of 6 and 7), and one dangerous terrain encounter (from the roll of 9). He then follows the rules in this chapter to place the lairs and terrain encounters in the first hex.

#### Placing Lairs in Civilized, Borderlands, or Outlands Hexes

In the original rules of ***ACKS****,* it was possible for unsettled territory to be classified as civilized or borderlands due to proximity to a city or large town. Therefore, ***Lairs & Encounters***provided rules for determining the number of lairs in those classifications of territory. In ***ACKS II***, all unclaimed and unsecured territory is always considered unsettled. As such, there is no need for separate columns on the Lairs per Hex table anymore. If a hex isn’t part of a domain, it’s unsettled. If it is part of a domain, the hexes don’t usually have lairs unless they dynamically arise from random wilderness encounters or domain encounters.

That said, it’s easy to imagine unusual situations. Perhaps when the campaign begins, beastmen have recently invaded, or wild magic is causing monsters to spawn where they normally would never appear. In such cases, you might want to know the maximum number of lairs that theoretically could be present in a settled hex (given that there must be land usage by the population). For civilized territory, the maximum number of lairs is 33% the amount in unsettled territory; for borderlands, 50%; and for outlands, 66%.
