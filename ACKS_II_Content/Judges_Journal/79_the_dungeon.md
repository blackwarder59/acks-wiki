## The Dungeon

A dungeon has both a **size** and a **level**. The size of the dungeon determines how many encounters it has, and the level determines how difficult those encounters are.

To find out how many encounters are in the dungeon, you can roll a number on the Encounters by Dungeon Size table below. Alternatively, if you have a mapped and stocked dungeon but simply want to abstract it, you can count up the number of rooms with monsters or traps.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Dungeon Size** | **Encounters** |
| Small | 1d3 |
| Medium | 2d3 |
| Large | 2d6 |
| Mega | 10d6 |

You should assign a dungeon level based on the difficulty of the encounters found in the dungeon (dungeon levels are defined from 1-6 as per *ACKS Core*). Presented at the end, in the Optional Rules section, are random tables for determining dungeon size and level.

In the case of a multi-level dungeon, treat each level as a separate dungeon. Access to lower levels may require clearing some or all of the encounters of a previous level, or they may all be accessible independently, at your discretion.
