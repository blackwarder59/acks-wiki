## Magic Research

All types of magic offer their casters the ability to engage in magic research, but the exact abilities granted can vary widely between types. Magic research actually consists of nine different abilities: collecting and using divine power; researching spells; scribing scrolls; brewing potions; creating permanent magic items; casting ritual spells; creating and designing magical constructs; create magical crossbreeds; and granting unlife. Each of these abilities has an effective caster level requirement as well as other prerequisites, detailed below.

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Magic Research Ability** | **Caster Level** | **Other Prerequisites** |
| Collect/Use Divine Power | 1st | Code of Behavior |
| Research Spells | 5th | Prayerful or Studious Magic |
| Scribe Scrolls | 5th | Prayerful or Studious Magic |
| Brew Potions | 5th | Transmogrification modifier 1.25 or less |
| Create Permanent Magic Items | 9th | Enchantment modifier 1.5 or less |
| Cast Ritual Spells | 11th | None; Effects vary by Progression |
| Create and Design Constructs | 11th / 9th | Prayerful or Studious Magic / Any Dwarf |
| Create Crossbreeds | 11th | Transmogrification modifier 1 or less |
| Grant Unlife | 11th | Death modifier 1.5 or less |

**Collect and Use Divine Power:** This is the ability for the character to draw on the divine power of a higher being to further magical research. Divine power can be collected from congregants and/or from sacrifice (if Chaotic). Divine power is available at 1st level. However, in order to collect and use divine power, the class must have some strictures dictated by its faith or imposed by the being granting the power. As such, only classes with a Code of Behavior gain this ability. The Arcane magic type does not enforce a Code of Behavior on its spellcasters, so they are not afforded this ability.

EXAMPLE: The Judge has determined that Faery magic imposes a Code of Behavior. Therefore any classes built with the Faery class category offer the ability to collect and use divine power, presumably from the royal courts of the fey or perhaps the otherworldly realm of the faery itself.

**Research Spells:** This is the ability for the character to use spell research spells that he does not have access to from scrolls, spell books, or (if a prayerful spellcaster) his deity**.** This ability is gained at an effective caster level of 5. However, magic types with an inherited repertoire never offer this ability.

EXAMPLE: The Judge has determined that Faery magic is inherited, so classes built with the Faery class category never offer the ability to research spells.

**Scribe Scrolls:** This is the ability for the character to create scrolls inscribed with spells. This ability is gained at an effective caster level of 5. This ability can be gained at level 3 if the ability to Brew Potions is delayed until level 7. (This option is not available if the magic type is disqualified from brewing potion altogether.) As with researching spells, spellcasters with Inherited magic never gain this ability.

EXAMPLE: The Judge has determined that Faery magic is inherited, so classes built with the Faery class category never offer the ability to scribe scrolls.

**Brew Potions:** This is the ability for the character to brew single-use potions. This ability is gained at an effective caster level of 5. In order to offer this ability, the magic type must have a Transmogrification modifier of 1.25 or less. This ability can be gained at level 3 if the ability to scribe scrolls is delayed until level 7. (This option is not available if the magic type is disqualified from scribing scrolls altogether.)

EXAMPLE: Faery magic has a Transmogrification modifier of 1, so classes built with the Faery class category will offer the ability to brew potions ability at 5th level.

**Create Permanent Magic Items:** This is the ability for the character to make multi-charge and permanent magic items such as wands, rings, swords, and armor. This ability is gained at an effective caster level of 9. In order to offer this ability, the magic type must have an Enchantment modifier of 1.5 or less.

EXAMPLE: Faery magic has an Enchantment modifier of 1, so classes built with the Faery class category will offer the ability to create permanent magic items at 9th level.

**Cast Ritual Spells:** This is the ability for the character to learn and cast very powerful enchantments. This ability is gained at an effective caster level of 11. If the magic type follows the Standard or Improved progression, it will offer ritual spells of 7th, 8th, and 9th level. If the magic type follows the Alternative progression, it will offer ritual spells of 6th and 7th level.

EXAMPLE: Faery magic follows the Alternative progression. Therefore, classes built with the Faery class category will gain the ability to cast ritual spells of 6th and 7th level when they reach 11th level.

**Create and Design Constructs:** This is the ability for the character to craft magical constructs such as gargoyles and golems. This ability is gained at an effective caster level of 11, or 9if the character is a Dwarven class. In order to offer this ability to non-Dwarves, the magic type must have a Blast modifier of 1.5 or less. Thus, the Divine magic type, with a Blast modifier of 2.25, does not afford non-Dwarven casters the ability create cronstructs.

EXAMPLE: Faery magic has a Blast modifier of 2.25, so classes built with the Faery class category will never offer the ability to create and design constructs, unless they are Dwarven custom classes.

**Create Crossbreeds:** This is the ability for the character to magically blend different progenitor creatures together to create a crossbreed monster. This ability is gained at an effective caster level of 11. In order to offer this ability, the magic type must have a Transmogrification modifier of 1 or less. Thus, the Divine magic type, with a Transmogrification modifier of 1.25, does not afford its casters the ability create crossbreeds.

EXAMPLE: Faery magic has a Transmogrification modifier of 1, so classes built with the Faery class category will offer the ability to create crossbreeds ability at 11th level.

**Grant Unlife:** This is the ability for the character to transform creatures into intelligent undead through necromancy. This ability is gained at an effective caster level of 11. In order to offer this ability, the magic type must have a Death modifier of 1.5 or less. Granting unlife is limited to Chaotic spellcasters, but this is a limitation of alignment rather than magic type.

EXAMPLE: Faery magic has a Death modifier of 1.5, so classes built with the Faery class category will offer the ability to grant unlife ability at 11th level.
