# Chapter 9: Non-Player Characters

In the course of running an ***ACKS II***campaign, you will assume the role of countless **non-player characters**. Such NPCs will include the various patrons and rulers who hire the adventurers; the henchmen, mercenaries, and specialists hired by the adventurers; the antagonists and rivals fought by the adventures; and of course the hard-working commoners, drunken boors, crusty tavern keepers, and other ordinary sorts that they encounter in your campaign world.
