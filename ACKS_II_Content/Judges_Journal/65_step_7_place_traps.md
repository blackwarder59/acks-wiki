## Step 7: Place Traps

Traps include deadfalls, spiked pits, poisoned needles in door handles, and other obstacles intended to harm, capture, or delay dungeon explorers. A trap is defined by its location, its trigger, its level, and its effects.

### Trap Locations

When determining the location of traps, you should consider their proximity to entryways, chokepoints, key intersections, and other factors. Unless the dungeon is a “fun house” made by some mad mage, traps should be placed with a purpose, such as protecting an area, interdicting a passage, raising an alarm, and so on.

### Trap Trigger Mechanisms

When you place a trap in a dungeon, you must decide how the trap is triggered. A trap might have a magical or mechanical trigger or even a combination of both. Some examples of trap triggers are:

* *Counterweights:*A system of weights that shifts when an object is removed or added, triggering a trap, such as a dart trap or a portcullis slamming down.
* *Gear Systems:* Complex arrangements of gears that interact when a specific action is taken, such as turning a key or solving a puzzle, which in turn triggers a trap.
* *Hidden Buttons:* Small buttons hidden in plain sight or disguised as part of the scenery that, when pressed, activate a trap, such as a wall of spikes or a sudden gust of wind.
* *Levers and Pulleys:* Hidden or disguised levers that, when pulled, trigger a trap, such as a collapsing floor or a flood of water.
* *Pivoting Floor Tiles:* Tiles that rotate when stepped on, causing the character to fall into a hidden pit or releasing a hidden mechanism.
* *Pressure plates:* Plates that, when stepped on, depress and activate a connected mechanism, such as releasing a projectile or opening a hidden door.
* *Proximity Triggers:* Devices that react to the presence of heat, sound, or movement, such as a brazier that ignites a flammable gas or a chime that summons guardians.
* *Runes:* Magical symbols that trigger a trap when touched or activated by a specific action, such as casting a spell or speaking a command word.
* *Tripwires:* Thin wires or ropes stretched across a path or doorway that, when tripped over, activate a trap, such as releasing a swinging log or dropping a net.
* *Weight-Sensitive Platforms:* Platforms that activate a trap when a specific weight is applied, such as a boulder rolling down a slope or a retracting bridge.

When an adventurer takes an action that might (but not necessarily will) activate a trap, such as walking down a corridor with a tripwire, you secretly roll 1d6. On a roll of 1-2, the adventurer has accidentally activated the trap. On a roll of 3-6, the adventurer has accidentally missed the trap entirely and it remains inactivated. (You can adjust the range of success if the trap is particularly hard or easy to set off.) Depending on the location of the trigger, the party’s formation, and the vagaries of chance, you might secretly roll many times before a hapless adventurer sets off a trap! Some traps can be accidentally activated by probing with a 10’ pole; in that case the pole is treated as an adventurer moving 5’ ahead of its bearer for purposes of activation.

###### Crude Traps

Some traps are crudely constructed with simple or jury-rigged mechanisms. These function similarly to ordinary traps, but are easier to spot and less effective. All characters gain a +4 bonus to find and remove crude traps. If a crude trap triggers an attack, it attacks with a -2 penalty. If a crude trap grants a saving throw, the target saves with a +2 bonus. Once set, a crude trap must be maintained, which requires one hour’s worth of maintenance per day. If unmaintained it ceases functioning.

### Trap Level

Like dungeons and spells, traps are rated in levels (1st – 6th). The level of a trap has two meanings. First, it indicates what level of a dungeon the trap is likely to appear on. For instance, the 1st level of a dungeon typically has 1st level traps. Second, it indicates the dangerousness of the trap relative to a divine spell of the same level when cast at minimum caster level. For instance, a 3rd level trap should be approximately as dangerous as a 3rd level divine spell cast by a 5th level caster.

Magical traps can simply trigger the desired spell, but non-magical traps should approximate the effect of a spell through mechanical means – ignition of flammable gases, release of darts, and so on. The comparison to spell level is intended as a guideline to appropriate areas of effect, attack throws, saving throws, and damage for mechanical traps, not an invitation to give miraculous powers to trappers.

EXAMPLE: The Judge is placing a trap on Level 1 of a dungeon. He decides that the trap’s trigger is a pressure plate that, when stepped on, triggers a blast of burning naphtha. How powerful should the naphtha blast be? Since it’s being placed on Level 1 of a dungeon, it should be about as powerful as a 1st level arcane spell. **Fan of flames** is a 1st level spell that deals 1d4 fire damage to all creatures within a 40’ x 20’ cone, or half that on a successful Blast save. **Fireball** is a 3rd level spell that deals 5d6 damage to all creatures in a 20’ diameter, half that on a successful Blast save. His naphtha trap should do damage that’s equal to or less than the damage from **fan of flames**, not **fireball**.

### Trap Effects

Thes effects of a trap can range from damaging attacks to area effects that require a saving throw to avoid or mitigate. The traps below are examples of classic traps with common mechanisms. Do not be afraid to concoct your own fiendish traps in addition to these! The suggestions below range from 1st to 6th level. Remember that more challenging dungeons should have deadlier traps.

###### Ceiling Collapse Trap

A section of the ceiling is rigged to collapse when triggered, potentially crushing characters underneath with bricks or stones. Each creature in a 10’ radius must make a Blast saving throw. If the save fails, the creature suffers bludgeoning damage from falling bricks or stones. If the save succeeds, the creature suffers half damage.

* *6th level*: A black hepatizon needle attacks the triggering creature as an 11th level fighter for 1 magical piercing damage. The needle is cursed with black magic to slowly sap life energy over a duration of 10 rounds. If the creature is damaged by the needle, it must make a Death save each round at the start of its initiative until the duration elapses. Each time the save fails, the creature instantly loses 1d8 points from its maximum hp. If the creature fails the save even once, it becomes **enervated** at the end of the duration. For purposes of removing the curse, consider it a 6th level spell cast by an 11th level caster.
