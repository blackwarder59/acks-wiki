## Zaharan Custom Classes

The Zaharan race originated in the fertile southlands that today are called the Waste. The Zaharans learned black arts of sorcery in countless centuries of foul service to the reptilian Thrassians. But as evil breeds evil, in time the Zaharans turned their sorcery against their inhuman masters. The Zaharan sorcerer Uragasi, calling himself the savior of men, led an uprising against the Thrassians and toppled the reptilian empire. Victorious over the reptile race, the Zaharans claimed the ancient capital of the Thrassians as their own, beginning an imperial era of all-too-human cruelty and rapaciousness. At their height, the Zaharans became the uncontested rulers of everything from the Pillars of Dawn to the Endless Steppe. Like the Thrassians before them, the Zaharans worshipped the Chthonic powers, and they created sub-human creatures to serve as slaves and soldiers. After four centuries of tyrannical dominance, the kingdom of Zahar fell to the wrath of Empyrean crusaders. In the aftermath, the Zaharan people were scattered and their civilization left in ruins. Only in Kemesh, Zahar’s most far-flung province, did Zaharan society survive the fall of their empire intact.

Though they once dominated the entire Ammas Aurë region, pure-blooded Zaharans are today exceptionally rare outside of the noble families of Kemesh. When they do appear, pure-blooded Zaharans are of moderate height, with gaunt stature. They have very long heads and faces featuring long, high noses, giving them an arrogant, slightly inhuman appearance. Their skin color is a warm brown, while their hair is thick, straight, and dark, and their eyes are black and deep set.

Outside of the Auran Empire campaign setting, Zaharans could be used to model any dark, eldritch race, such as the Melnibonéans of Moorcock’s Multiverse or the Drow of Gygax’s Greyhawk.

Zaharan character classes are created using the Zaharan racial category and experience points. Requirements, class category values, hit points per level after 9th, and experience point progressions are modified as noted below.

### Requirements

All Zaharan classes require a minimum Intellect, Will, and Charisma of 9 or better.

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Value** | **Zaharan** | **XP Cost** |
| 4 | Zaharan + 100% Arcane | 2700 |
| 3 | Zaharan + 66% Arcane | 2075 |
| 2 | Zaharan + 50% Arcane | 1450 |
| 1 | Zaharan + 33% Arcane | 825 |
| 0 | Zaharan | 200 |

### Class Category Values

**Arcane:** Any build points allocated to the Arcane Value stack with build points allocated to the Zaharan value for purposes of determining the class’s spellcasting ability (see below).

### Zaharan Value

When building a Zaharan custom class, assign between 0 and 4 build points to the class’s Zaharan Value. At Zaharan 0, all Zaharans gain the following four Zaharan custom powers:

* **After the Flesh:** Through undeath, the black sorcerers of Zahar can grow stronger. If transformed into intelligent undead, they retain their racial powers and any class abilities. Their class abilities must still be paid for as special abilities (see below).

The number of special abilities the class abilities are worth is determined by tallying up its build points. Add 1/2 its build points in the Arcane, Divine, or other magic type values; 1/3 its build points in the Thievery value; and 1/3 its build points in any racial values that don’t improve spellcasting. Don’t add any for its HD or Fighting value. For example, a Zaharan ruinguard (built with HD 2, Fighting 2, and Zaharan 2) has 0 + 0 + 2/2 = 1 special ability (\*).

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Class**  **Category** | **# of Special**  **Abilities (\*)** |
| Arcane/Divine | Category Value /2 |
| Thievery/Racial | Category Value /3 |
| Fighting/HD | 0 |

Once transformed, a Zaharan may continue to advance in Hit Dice without limit, regardless of his class’s maximum level. At 1 HD, it requires 3,000XP plus 500XP per special ability (\*) to advance to 2 HD. The amount of XP required doubles with each HD (round values greater than 20,000XP to the nearest 1,000).

As the undead Zaharan’s Hit Dice increase, any class abilities (such as thief skills, spellcasting, turning undead, etc.) will continue to progress without regard to his class’s maximum level, to a maximum of 14th level.

* **Ancient Pacts:** In elder days, the lords of Zahar ensorcelled the dark powers of the world in pacts of service and obedience. Some creatures still remember these pacts and will aid Zaharans when commanded. All Zaharans gain a +1 bonus to reaction rolls when encountering intelligent chaotic monsters. Intelligent chaotic monsters suffer a -2 penalty to saving throws against any **charm** spells cast by a Zaharan.
* **Dark Soul:** The grim embrace of death holds special perils for Zaharan characters. Whenever a deceased Zaharan rolls on the Tampering With Mortality table, they suffer a penalty on the 1d20 roll of -1 per level of experience.
* **Inexorable:** Zaharans are unflinching in the face of horrors that terrify normal men. The character is immune to all natural and magical fear effects.
* **Zaharan Tongues:** All Zaharans speak four bonus languages: Ancient Zaharan, Goblin, Orc, and Kemeshi.

EXAMPLE: Let’s imagine that Zaharan Sorcerer-Priest is designed as a custom class with all the spellcasting abilities of both a crusader and mage (Hit Dice 0, Fighting 0, Thievery 0, Divine 2, Arcane 2, Zaharan 2). This class costs 6 build points, meaning its maximum level is 11. After many sessions of play, a Zaharan Sorcerer-Priest character has advanced to 11th level. The character then transforms into a mummy by necromantic ritual. The class’s build points, excluding Hit Dice, are (2+2+2) 6, so retaining the class abilities count as three special abilities. The character is therefore an 11\*\*\*\* HD mummy (11 HD because he was 11th level; \* from mummy; \*\*\* from class abilities). The Zaharan Mummy Sorcerer-Priest then begins advancing in HD. His HD may advance without limit. His class abilities will continue to increase as he gains HD, until he achieves the maximum of 14th level of divine and arcane spellcasting ability.

Additional points allocated to the Zaharan Value stack with points allocated to the Arcane Value for purposes of spellcasting, magical research, strongholds, and magic item usability. Add the two values to find the class’s effective spellcasting abilities. For values of 5 or greater, use the following mechanics:

**Arcane + Zaharan 5:** The class has the ability to cast spells and engage in magical research as a mage, with the class’s spells per level increased by 33%. The class uses its class level for all level-dependent spell ranges, durations, and damages; these are not increased.

**Arcane + Zaharan 6:** As above, but the class’s spells per level are increased by 50%.

**Arcane + Zaharan 7:** As above, but the class’s spells per level are increased by 66%.

**Arcane + Zaharan 8:** As above, but the class’s spells per level are increased by 100%.

When calculating number of spells available, round fractions of 1/2 or more up; round any smaller fractions down. All Zaharan spellcasters can cast spells wearing whatever armor they are permitted to use.

### Experience Point Progression After 8th level

Zaharans increase the amount of experience required to gain each level after 8th by 50,000XP. This penalty does not apply if they become undead, however.
