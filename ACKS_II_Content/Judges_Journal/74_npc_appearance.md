## NPC Appearance

Determining the appearance of a character, whether PC or NPC, is important; after all, their appearance is the first thing anyone notices about them, whether it is how they look physical, or what they wear and carry. It can be notably difficult to come up with a quick trait to distinguish individual NPCs, especially the otherwise nameless individuals PCs might unexpectedly address while at an inn or in the village market, or in the case of groups of otherwise identical foes such as bandits or beastmen, fight. Yet, it can be useful to give some at least a single defining trait, if only to make it easier to know who is fighting who.

Although you can simply assign a character whatever height, weight, and appearance traits you desire, it can be fun to roll for these elements randomly, especially if inspiration hasn’t struck. The following provides the means to generate builds, heights, weights, and distinguishing features for characters including the influence of high or low Strength, as well as eye, hair and skin color based on the races and cultures of the Auran Empire setting. Of course, you should feel free to simply choose results too as these characteristics have no real mechanical impact on play. (Not even weight! All characters count as 15 stone.)

So that they can be used for a wide variety of NPC types, some tables are split into Chaotic/Any/Lawful tables; Judges should select the tables most appropriate to the individual(s) they are determining traits for. Tables labelled “Any” may typically be used for nearly any NPC regardless of Alignment.

Most of the results in the various tables can easily be presented in different terms. Broad can be *wide-shouldered* or *curvaceous*, Small can be *petite* or *elfin*, Slim can be *slender* or *svelte*, Tall can be *statuesque*, and so on. Also, when looking at belongings, consider color, materials, and style. That cap could be faded purple velvet with a wilted feather or it could be crudely stitched rat skin, for example.

### How to Use These Tables

* For PCs, use Part One: Height and Weight; Part Two: Eye Color, Hair Color and Texture, and Skin Color; and Part Three: Physical Features. Roll or make choices along the way as desired based on Charisma and Race/Culture.
* For highly detailed NPCs, follow the same process as for PCs if desired, but use Part Four: Belongings and Styles as well to determine those extra elements, rolling or making choices as necessary.
* For quick and unimportant NPCs, skip straight to Part Four: Belongings and Styles, to determine a single distinguishing trait.

### Part One: Height and Weight

Follow the steps below to determine a character’s height, weight, and general build.

#### Step 1: Determine Baseline

Roll for the character’s Baseline Height and Weight according to race and gender. The results may be modified by culture as noted here.

###### Baseline Height and Weight

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Race** | **Height** | **Weight** |
| Dwarf (m) | 43”+2d4” | 130+4d10 lbs. |
| Dwarf (f) | 41”+2d4” | 110+4d10 lbs. |
| Elf (m) | 61”+2d4” | 110+6d6 lbs. |
| Elf (f) | 57”+2d4” | 90+6d6 lbs. |
| Gnome (m) | 34”+2d4” | 30+4d6 lbs. |
| Gnome (f) | 32”+2d4” | 25+4d6 lbs. |
| Halfling (m) | 32”+2d4” | 25+4d8 lbs. |
| Halfling (f) | 30”+2d4” | 20+4d8 lbs. |
| Human (m)\* | 60”+2d6” | 110+8d6 lbs. |
| Human (f)\* | 55”+2d6” | 90+8d6 lbs. |

\*Includes Zaharans and Nobirans

###### Baseline Culture Modifiers

* **Human (Celdorean):** Add 2” to baseline Height. Increase baseline Weight by 5%.
* **Human (Corcani):** Add 1” to baseline Height. Increase baseline Weight by 3%.
* **Human (Jutlander):** Add 3” to baseline Height. Increase baseline Weight by 12.5%.
* **Human (Kemeshi)**: Decrease baseline Weight by 9%.
* **Human (Krysean):** Add 1” to baseline Height. Increase baseline Weight by 6.5%.
* **Human (Kushtu):** Add 3” to baseline Height. Increase baseline Weight by 5%.
* **Human (Nicean):** Add 1” to baseline Height. Increase baseline Weight by 6.5%.
* **Human (Opelenean):** Increase baseline Weight by 6.5%.
* **Human (Rornish):** Add 3” to baseline Height. Increase baseline Weight by 9%.
* **Human (Shebatean):** Add 1” to baseline Height.
* **Human (Somirean):** Increase baseline Weight by 3%.
* **Human (Skysos):** Subtract 2” from baseline Height.
* **Human (Tirenean):** Add 2” to baseline Height. Increase baseline Weight by 6.5%.
* **Human (Zaharan):** Add 2” to baseline Height. Decrease baseline Weight by 2.5%.
* **Nobiran:** Use the human culture they were born within but add 2” extra to the baseline Height and 8 lbs. extra to baseline Weight.

#### Step 2: Determine Build

Roll 2d6, adding or subtracting twice any modifiers for high or low Strength. If the character’s build is Average for their race, there is no need to modify the baseline results from Step 1, and the process is finished. Ignore fractions of pounds when making calculations.

EXAMPLE #1*:* Hakan, a male crusader from Skysostan, has no modifiers for Strength. The Player rolls Hakan’s baseline Height and Weight, getting 67” and 138 lbs, but reduces the Height to 65” (5’5”) because Hakan is from Skysostan. The Player then rolls for Hakan’s Build, getting a result of 10; Hakan is *Broad*. This modifies the baseline Weight by 20%, adding 28 lbs for a total Weight of 166 lbs. At 5’5” and 166 lbs., Hakan is short and stocky!

EXAMPLE #2*:* Dagr the Mighty, a male barbarian from Jutland with Strength 17, has an impressive +2 Strength modifier, doubled to +4 for purposes of the character’s Build roll. The Player rolls Dagr’s baseline Height and Weight of 69” (increased to 72” due to Dagr being a Jutlander) and 142 lbs (increased by 12.5% to 160 lbs due to Dagr being a Jutlander). The Player then rolls for Dagr’s Build, adding the doubled Strength modifier of +4. He rolls a 10, for a final total of 12: *Large*. He increases Dagr’s Height by 10% to 79” (6’7”!) and his Weight by 3 0% to 256 lbs. Dagr’s a tall, highly impressive, and clearly strong individual.

EXAMLE #3*:* Aliyah, a female Shebatean thief, has a -1 Strength modifier. This translates as a -2 modifier on her Build roll. The Player rolls baselines of 60” (5’) and 128 lbs. She rolls for Build, subtracting 2 due to the Strength modifier and an extra 1 for being Shebatean, and gets a final number of 2: *Slim*. Aliyah’s Weight is reduced by 20% to 102 lbs. She’s a slender woman, slightly shorter than normal.

### Part Three: Physical Features

Sometimes, just one or two key physical points are all that is needed to help define what a character looks like. Characters with no CHA modifier should only roll once on the Average table. Characters with a negative CHA modifier should roll once on the Average table and then roll a number of times on the Negative table equal to their modifier. Characters with a positive CHA modifier should roll once on the Average table and then roll a number of times on the Positive table equal to their modifier. In the case of non-human characters, results should be interpreted or rerolled in some cases as needed.
