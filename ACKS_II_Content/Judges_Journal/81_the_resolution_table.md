## The Resolution Table

Once the total modifier is known, roll 1d8+1d12 on the resolution table, adding the resolution modifier to the result.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Abstract Dungeon Resolution** | |
| **Roll (1d8+1d12)** | **Result** |
| 2- | Catastrophic |
| 3-5 | Dreadful |
| 6-8 | Unsatisfactory |
| 9-12 | Indifferent |
| 13-16 | Satisfactory |
| 17-19 | Excellent |
| 20+ | Stupendous |

**Catastrophic:** Every adventurer is slain. An expedition may be sent to retrieve their bodies; if the new party successfully fully clears the dungeon, they may retrieve the bodies of the fallen in lieu of treasure. (They receive experience as normal for encounters defeated.)

**Dreadful:** 1d6 adventurers suffer mortal wounds. No treasure is earned from this foray.

**Unsatisfactory:** 1d4-1 adventurers suffer mortal wounds. Only 50% of normal treasure is earned from this foray.

**Indifferent:** 1d3-2 adventurers suffer mortal wounds. 100% of normal treasure is earned from this foray.

**Satisfactory:** 1d4-3 adventurers suffer mortal wounds. 125% of normal treasure is earned from this foray.

**Excellent:** 1d6-5 adventurers suffer mortal wounds. 150% of normal treasure is earned from this foray.

**Stupendous:** On a stupendous result, no adventurers suffer mortal wounds, and 200% of normal treasure is earned from this foray.

When one or more adventurers suffer a mortal wound, determine which adventurer was injured randomly. An adventurer who suffers a mortal wound may no longer participate in the expedition until they recover. Roll on the Mortal Wounds - Savage table using only the adventurer's Constitution, and HD, and equipment modifiers as adjustments to the d20. An adventurer whose mortal wound requires that he be healed to 1 HP dies unless the party can heal the character or bring him back to civilization in the time allotted.

EXAMPLE:A party of four 14th level characters find themselves in front of a 1st level dungeon. Bored, they decide to slaughter its inhabitants. The Judge informs them that this dungeon has twelve encounters; they laugh and say they will fight all twelve. Facing 11 encounters on a single foray has a difficulty modifier of -3. The listed level for Effortless on a first level dungeon is 6-7, so the 14th level characters are off the table to the right. There is no additional bonus for being off the table to the right; there is always some chance of failure, but sometimes there is no chance of success. Their total resolution modifier is 8 – 3 = +5. They roll 1d12+1d8+5 on the Resolution Table and score a 20 – a Stupendous success. They slaughter the dungeon’s inhabitants mercilessly and reap 200% of normal treasure.
