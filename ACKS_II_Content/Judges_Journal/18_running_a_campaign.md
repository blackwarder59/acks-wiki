## Running a Campaign

Running a long-term RPG campaign is the hallmark of the best Judges. The greatest long-term campaigns — Greyhawk, Blackmoor, Glorantha, Forgotten Realms, Arduin, Wilderlands — ran for decades, and literally changed the way people thought about fantasy and gaming. Such hallowed success is probably beyond us all these days, but running a long-term campaign is nevertheless an admirable goal and a wonderful experience.

We define a successful long-term ***ACKS*** campaign as a campaign that runs on a regular schedule that allows the players to complete the experience available to them in ***ACKS***. That could mean advancing from level 1 to 14; that could mean exploring the complete sandbox you’ve built; that could mean being crowned king. What it does **not** mean is a slow death because of lack of interest and involvement. And yet that’s the fate of most campaigns. It doesn’t need to be that way!

### **Scheduling for Success**

The first step towards running a successful campaign is scheduling for success. During the halcyon days of Greyhawk, Gary Gygax ran his campaign six days out of seven, and he was writing not just the campaign, but all the rules, spells, and content! While in today’s world it’s hard to be as hardcore as Gary, nevertheless steady play is essential to sustain a game. The most sustainable schedule for an RPG campaign is either weekly or fortnightly. Successful RPG campaigns are sustained by commitment — by the sense that “it’s all real” — and that requires ongoing reinforcement of the activities. Campaigns are similar to TV shows in that they require an ongoing immersion in an imaginary world. Two weeks seems to be about the longest length of time most people can be away from their imaginary worlds without losing track of what's going on. One week keeps it even fresher in their mind.

The single biggest obstacle towards running RPGs on a weekly basis is the false belief that maintaining a weekly game is impossible in today’s world because we are all “too busy.” But most of us are not, in fact, too busy. The real reason we seem too busy is because we have more options for things to do. After all, we live in the future! And in the future people have access to mobile phones, on-demand movies, endless videogames, non-stop social media, and more.

Consider that the average casual video gamer is now playing for 20 hours per week — or that the average person watches more than 33 hours of TV per week. Consider that a dedicated World of Warcraft gamer who raids twice per week and grinds the other nights spends 40 hours per week in his game. Consider the time spent by dedicated golfers, who may hit the course every weekend; or by ESPN enthusiasts, who watch sports daily plus all day Sunday as a major social gathering.

In contrast to these 20-to-40 hour commitments, running a successful RPG campaign takes about 5 hours once per week plus at most 8 – 10 hours of prep time by the GM. Any of the hobbyists above have more than enough leisure time to run a weekly RPG campaign. If you’re like most people, the real question is not “do I have time?”, but really “is this actually one of the things I want to make a priority to do with my time?”

If the answer is yes, read on. If the answer is no, then you are better off running casual one-off sessions then attempting a major campaign. That's your choice.

### **How Many Players?**

How many players should you invite to your weekly ***ACKS***campaign? Sadly, ***ACKS***Judges are rather unevenly distributed, and as a result some gamemasters struggle to find even one or two players while others run the “only game in town” and have to actively limit their players to a manageable number. Acknowledging that reality, there is still a definite sweet spot for how many players you should aim for: three to seven, with five being ideal.

Why is five players the ideal number? With five players, you have enough for the players to cover most of the core classes, without so many players that henchmen and followers become unnecessary. You can give each player sufficient in-game attention without slowing the game down. If one or even two players can’t make a particular session, you can still run with a group of three or more. And in terms of seating, most dinner tables have six seats, meaning there's one for you and five for them.

If you are one of the lucky ***ACKS***Judges who has access to a wide pool of players, you can certainly run with seven (I do), though it will slow the game down a bit. If you have more than seven, though, and you’re new to ***ACKS****,* it might be better if you can split them up into two groups, or get another gamemaster to help you out.

### **Tabletop Campaigns are Team Sports, Not Social Events**

If you're planning to start a successful campaign, you need to explain to your friends that you are not hosting a series of social events. You are starting an intramural sports team and asking them if they'd like to be on the team.

It's true that role-playing games are like social events in that some of the fun is socializing with your friends. But the problem with treating an RPG as a social event is that the etiquette of social events does not lend itself to RPGs at all. Consider the notion of “fashionably late” at a social event — where you demonstrate your social status by not bothering to show up until the event is already underway. Or consider the notion of “stopping by” a social event, where you put two or three events on the schedule and visit each one for only a portion of the time. Or even consider “blowing off” a social event, where you simply don’t attend because something better came up. You can throw a party for guests who behave that way, but you sure can’t run an RPG when the players are fashionably late, stopping by, or blowing it off.

That’s why you need to position joining the campaign as akin to joining a sports team. People can often have trouble understanding why they need to show up on time and stay through until the end at a social event, but everyone understands that the quarterback needs to show up at the football game and finish the game.

Moreover, many if not most people have been on an intramural sports team at one point in their life, and so it’s a simple analogy for them to understand and puts into perspective the time commitment. A player who balks at committing to your campaign as an intramural sport is almost certainly a player who will miss a lot of sessions. And that’s important, because missing sessions is one of the worst thing a player can do to a campaign.

### **Missing in Action**

Even with the most well-intentioned and dedicated players, there will be times when one or more of them can't make it. An ongoing challenge for every ***ACKS***Judge is what to do when one or more players go “missing in action.” On the web, you can find recommendations ranging from cancelling the game to running with the missing player’s characters killed and everything seen in between. Most of these recommendations are wrong.

The first thing to know is: Don’t cancel the game**. The game must go on.**As long as you have more than half of your group available (3 players out of 5, for instance), the game goes on. Pragmatically, in any regular weekly campaign, there will almost certainly be one or two absent players in any given session due to work, illness, travel, kids, etc. If you cancel whenever one or two people are missing, then you’ll be canceling more often than you are running. Philosophically, the campaign should be larger than any one player or any one faction of players. If you cancel because of someone else’s decision that they can’t or won’t come play, then you’ve handed over control of the destiny of your campaign to that person.

There’s no hard and fast rule about what you should do with the missing player’s characters. It will depend on the style of game you are running. If you’re running a collective group, then let the attending players run their friend’s PCs and give everyone full experience points, so they stay on the same advancement curve. If you’re running a competitive-collective group, then you should NPC the missing player characters, and award them a limited experience award. If you’re running an individualist group, then the missing player characters are absent pursuing other agendas (or present as NPCs if that’s impossible), and they should not get any experience.

These methods are what we use in practice and they work very well. For instance, in our weekly (collective) ACKS campaign, with 7 players, we play if there are 4 players available. The attending players run the missing player’s characters while they are away.

### **You Must Lead By Example**

None of the advice above will sustain a campaign alone. ***You*** must sustain it. As the Judge, you are the heart and soul of the group. If you show up late, you cannot expect the players to show up on time. If you do not put time in between sessions into prepping the game, you cannot expect the players to bother to remember what went on last session. If you cancel the game because you have a tummy ache, then you can’t expect your players to have any more commitment.

But if you do have the commitment, running a long-term campaign is one of the most satisfying experiences you can enjoy. It’s the sort of experience that the rules in this book are designed to create, and that we hope you’ll pursue with gusto.
