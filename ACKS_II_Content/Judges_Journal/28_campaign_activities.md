## Campaign Activities

During campaign play, characters have the opportunity to undertake various campaign activities, ranging from adventuring to performing magical research. The rules for campaign activities were introduced in the ***ACKS II******Revised Rulebook***and are presented here so that you don’t have to flip between the books when running the sequence of play.

### Types of Campaign Activities

Activities are divided into **dedicated activities**, **ancillary activities**, and **incidental activities**. Dedicated activities are laborious tasks requiring eight hours to perform. A character who undertakes a dedicated activity is sometimes said to “dedicate the day to that activity.” For instance, “Balbus dedicated the day to magic research” or “the party dedicated the day to travel.”

Ancillary activities are errands or pastimes requiring about one hour (6 turns) to perform. Incidental activities require virtually no time at all. Each game day, an adventurer can undertake one dedicated activity and four ancillary activities or perform up to 12 ancillary activities. A character can perform any number of incidental activities.

Most campaign activities are **singular** **activities** that take place within a single game day, and can be repeated as often as desired within the limits of available activity.A **restricted activity** takes place within a single day, but cannot be repeated until a certain time period elapses. An **ongoing activity** require more than one game day to complete, such that the character will have to perform the activity throughout the given time period. Both dedicated and ancillary activities can be ongoing. A **dedicated ongoing activity** represents a period of full-time labor in order to complete a complex project or task. Magical research, for instance, is a dedicated ongoing activity typically requiring days, weeks, or even months. An **ancillary ongoing activity** represents an intermittent effort occurring in short bursts that must be sustained over a lengthy period of time. Managing a subordinate, for instance, typically requires a short period of time every day for as long as the subordinate is employed.

Most campaign activities are **unstrenuous**, but some are **strenuous.** For every six game days of strenuous activity, a character must dedicate one day to **rest**. Characters who do not get the appropriate rest after six game days of strenuous activity become **fatigued** until they have caught up on required rest. (This is why wilderness travel requires rest and recuperation!) Unstrenuous activities do not require rest.

A character can undertake one, two, three, or even four strenuous ancillary activities without being considered to have engaged in strenuous activity. However, if he undertakes five or more strenuous ancillary activities, he is considered to have engaged in strenuous activity.

Sometimes adventurers might wish to completely dedicate to an activity, that is, to use both their dedicated activity and all of their ancillary activities that day on the task. This is known as **working overtime** (for most activities) or **force marching** (for travel). A character who is working overtime or force marching completely dedicates his day to the activity, and cannot take any ancillary activities; in exchange, he increases time spent and/or distance traveled by 50%.

However, working overtime on an unstrenuous activity makes the activity count as a strenuous activity, so it can only be sustained for six days until rest is required. Force marching or working overtime on a strenuous activity counts as six days of strenuous activity, immediately requiring rest.

In desperate circumstances, characters might want to work all day and through the night. Each additional four ancillary activities (four hours) after working overtime or force marching increases the fatigue penalty by 1 point (rounded up).

Some ongoing activities require a proficiency throw to complete. Characters who work overtime on ongoing activities apply the worst penalty to this throw that they incurred at any point during the process. A minimum penalty of -1 applies if the character worked overtime at all, even if through careful pacing he avoided otherwise incurring penalties.

Most campaign activities are open to any character. Others can only be undertaken if the character meets particular requirements of class, level, location, proficiency, or equipment. The requirements are noted in the activity’s description.

The activities rules are implicitly present in all aspects of play. For instance, delving a dungeon requires an ancillary activity for every 6 turns of exploration. Traveling at expedition speed requires making travel the party’s dedicated activity. Foraging for food is an ancillary activity, so it can be done on the same day dedicated to wilderness travel, but hunting is a dedicated activity so it cannot.

EXAMPLE: After two weeks of overtime (21 days total), Maon has finished a magical research project. Each week he worked five days of overtime, performing magical research twice each day, and then rested for two subsequent days, for a total of (5 x2 x 3) 30 days’ worth of magical research activity. He suffers a -2 penalty to his magic research throw.

### List of Campaign Activities

The lists below summarize the ancillary and dedicated activities that characters in ***ACKS II*** can undertake. Note that not every character can undertake every type of activity. Strenuous activities are listed in *italics*. Strenuous activities always include 1 turn (10 minutes) of rest every 5 turns, e.g. 1 turn of rest per hour.
