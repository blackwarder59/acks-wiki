## Abstract Dungeon Foray Resolution

The interaction between party level and dungeon level determines the base difficulty and base modifier to the resolution roll. Consult the table below and find the party’s party level in the row for the appropriate dungeon level (see below if the party level is not listed in the row for the dungeon level). The value in the top row of that column is the base **resolution modifier** for that foray. The adjective in the row below it describes the relative **difficulty** of the foray.

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Base Resolution Modifier** | | | | | | | |
|  | -8 | -4 | -2 | 0 | +2 | +4 | +8 |
| **Dungeon Level** | Apocalyptic | Horrifying | Dangerous | Accessible | Easy | Simple | Effortless |
| **1** | - | - | - | 1 | 2-3 | 4-5 | 6-7 |
| **2** | - | - | 1 | 2-3 | 4-5 | 6-7 | 8-9 |
| **3** | - | 1 | 2-3 | 4-5 | 6-7 | 8-9 | 10-11 |
| **4** | 1 | 2-3 | 4-5 | 6-7 | 8-9 | 10-11 | 12-13 |
| **5** | 2-3 | 4-5 | 6-7 | 8-9 | 10-11 | 12-13 | 14 |
| **6** | 4-5 | 6-7 | 8-9 | 10-11 | 12-13 | 14 | - |

EXAMPLE: The Claws of the Lioness are a 3rd level party of four adventurers. The party is foraying into the Buried Temple of Sakkara, a 1st level dungeon. On the Dungeon Level 1 row, a party level of 2-3 results in a resolution modifier of +2 (Easy difficulty).

### Under- or Over-Strength Parties

If the party level is off the table, move up or down a number of rows until the party’s level is reached. Consider your difficulty to be an additional number of columns to the right (easier) for each row you moved down, or an additional number of columns to the left (harder) for each row you moved up. For each column to the left you are off the table, apply an additional -8 penalty. There is no additional bonus for being off the table to the right; there is always some chance of failure, but sometimes there is no chance of success.

EXAMPLE: The Claws of the Lioness launch a foray into the Ruined City of Zahar, a 6th level dungeon. Consulting the Base Resolution Modifier table, the Judge sees that the party level of 3 is off the table. The Judge shifts up one row to reach party level 2-3, with a resolution modifier of -8 (Apocalyptic difficulty). Since he moved one row up, he now shifts one row to the left to calculate the resolution modifier. That moves him one column off the table, triggering an additional -8 penalty, or -16 total!

### Number of Encounters

The number of encounters attempted in a foray factors into the resolution modifier as well. Consult the table below to see the adjustment made. A positive number moves the difficulty that many columns to the left, while a negative number moves the difficulty that many columns to the right. (That is, a positive number means that they are easier, while a negative number means they are harder.)

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Resolution Modifier by Encounters Attempted** | |
| **Encounters** | **Resolution Modifier** |
| 1 | +1 |
| 2 | 0 |
| 3-5 | -1 |
| 6-8 | -2 |
| 9-12 | -3 |
| Each additional 3 | Additional -1 |

### Party Size

If there are five to seven adventurers, the party receives a +1 bonus to the resolution roll. If there are eight or more adventurers, the party receives a +2 bonus.

There is no penalty for having a small party, because if there are less than four adventurers, the party level will have been calculated as the sum of all levels divided by four, instead of being the average level. (A single 14th level character in a first level dungeon would count as a 4th level party, giving them a +4 modifier.)
