The Hit Dice Value determines the Hit Die the class uses from 1st to 9th level. (A class’s hit points increase after 9th level based on its saving throw progression). It also provides a modifier to the class’s rolls on the Mortal Wounds table when he is reduced to 0 hp or less.

Assign from 0 to 4 build points to the class’s Hit Dice Value, noting down the appropriate Hit Die and the XP cost.

EXAMPLE: The standard fighter was built with Hit Die Value 2. Fighters roll 1d8 for hit points from 1st to 9th level.
