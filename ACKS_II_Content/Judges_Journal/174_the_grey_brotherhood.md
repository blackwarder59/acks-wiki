## The Grey Brotherhood

Twenty-five years ago, the Grey Brotherhood was a company of adventure renowned for its glorious deeds throughout the Meniri Mountains. Today, the company consists of the children of the original members. What they lack in experience and knowledge, they make up for with high morale and unshakeable camaraderie.

The Grey Brotherhood was designed to include one of each of the six core classes, making it a great party to use for a quick-start campaign or one-off introduction to ***ACKS II****.* The ongoing exploits of the Grey Brotherhood can be seen on Autarch’s YouTube channel.

###### Andravus Iskarian

**1st level Explorer** (played by Jonathan Oldenburg)

**Stat Line:** AC 4, Spd 20’ / 60’, HP 7, ATK 1 (long bow 9+, short sword and dagger 9+, or spear 10+), Dmg 1d6+1, 1d6+1, or 1d8+1, Init +2, ML +1, AL Lawful

**Background:** Born in a rural Tirenean village near the forest, Andravus dreamed of being a scout in the Legion from an early age. Though his parents encouraged him to pursue an independent path, Andravus enlisted when he came of age. He was soon drummed out of the legion after running afoul of a corrupt centurion. It was enough experience, though, to realize that his father had been right all along both in this and in his warning that Aura was being eaten apart from the inside by corruption. Andravus became a free-ranging pathfinder in the interior wilds of Nicea. He was on one such foray when he got word that his father’s old company of adventure, the Grey Brotherhood, was being reformed.

**Description:** Andravus is of middling height with a lanky build. He has blue-grey eyes, ash brown hair, and light olive skin that is heavily weathered by wind and sun. Though explorers are often dour and gruff, Andravus is an affable fellow that wins friends easily.

###### Avaris Mac Cade

**1st level Thief** (played by James Young)

**Stat Line:** AC 3, Spd 20’ / 60’, HP 4, ATK 1 (short bow 9+, Short sword and dagger 9+), Dmg 1d6, Init +1, ML 0, AL Neutral

**Background:** Avaris’s father, Cade, sired him on a harlot who worked in one of Cyfaraun’s many brothels. Cade was largely absent from Avaris’s life for over a decade, but he made sure to divert funds from his adventuring exploits to give him a comfortable childhood. Around the time Avaris became a teenager, his father retired from adventuring and sought him out. Cade began to teach Avaris the tradecraft of the thief. Though Avaris proved skillful in executing hijinks with his father, he aspired to greater deeds. When the Grey Brotherhood was re-established, Avaris saw his chance to prove his worth.

**Description:** Avaris is a lean man with narrow eyes and bland appearance, apart from a devilish smile that occasionally flashes when he has pulled off a hijink. He favors non-descript clothes that don’t attract attention.

###### Castinus Acrodynas

**1st level Venturer** (played by Sean Falconi)

**Stat Line:** AC 2, Spd 30’ / 90’, HP 5, ATK 1 (crossbow 10+ or short sword and dagger 9+), Dmg 1d6, Init +0, ML 0, AL Neutral

**Background:** Castinus was born into a family of merchants that has done business in the Borderlands for generations – though not always successfully. After incurring disastrous losses in the spice trade, Castinus’ father Paternus founded the original Grey Brotherhood in a desperate attempt to regain his wealth. To Paternus’s surprise, the Grey Brotherhood proved highly profitable. With the plunder earned on over a decade of exploits, Paternus was able to rebuild the family’s trading business into a thriving enterprise. Recently, the family caravan has headed west, to support the legions fighting the Skysos. Castinus has stayed behind in order to re-form his father’s old adventuring company with his childhood friends.

**Description:** Castinus maintains high standards of clothing and appearance. His build is average for Auran society, and lean from a lifetime of travel and hustle on the road. Before he became an adventurer, Castinus was a highly social “man about town.” Having nearly died several times, an air of grit and pragmatism has set in him. While still able to negotiate and build financial relationships, he is increasingly looking to violently punish the enemies of law, commerce and the empire.

###### Hyglak Halfhand

**1st level Fighter** (played by Grant Sinclair)

**Stat Line:** AC 4, Spd 30’ / 90’, HP 6, ATK 1 (great axe 7+ or thrown axe 10+), Dmg 1d10+4 or 1d6+4, Init +0, ML +1, AL Neutral

**Attributes:** STR 18, INT 8, WIL 7, DEX 10, CON 10, CHA 9

**Saving Throws:** Paralysis 14+, Death 15+, Blast 16+, Implements 17+, Spells 18+

**Class Powers:**  Manual of Arms

**Proficiencies:** Adventuring, Berserkergang, Endurance

**Languages:** Common, Juttish

**Equipment:** Great axe, hand axe, chain mail armor, thick wool cloak, wool tunic and pants, leather belt, low boots, belt pouch, small sack, waterskin, 1 week’s iron rations (enc. 6 4/6 st)

**Background:** Hyglak Hergerson is the son of Herger, one of the original Grey Brothers. Following his retirement from the Brotherhood, Herger returned north to his home amongst the Jutland raiders and started a family. Herger trained his children in the Auran arts of war, creating fighters with civilized skill and barbarian courage. Hyglak, the third son, chaffed under his father’s and elder brother’s rule of the family assets and desired to earn his own name. With his father’s blessing, he headed south to join with the sons of his father’s former mercenary company to seek fortune and glory.

**Description:** Hyglak is tall and well-muscled with a harsh, chiseled face. He has bright grey eyes almost hidden by an unkempt mane of ruddy brown hair and full beard. In civilized company, his lack of manners is balanced by his love of ale and a good time. In battle, his recklessness is only barely restrained by the discipline of his father’s training. Early on, he earned the name “Halfhand” from his propensity to lose fingers in battle.

###### Raemon Ouras

**1st level Crusader** (played by Grant Sinclair)

**Stat Line:** AC 7, Spd 20’ / 60’, HP 6, ATK 1 (mace 10+), Dmg 1d6 Init +1, ML +1, AL Lawful

**Attributes:** STR 12, INT 10, WIL 15, DEX 13, CON 13, CHA 16

**Class Powers:**  Divine Magic (1 1st), Rebuke Undead, Theology

**Background:** Raemon the Elder – better known as the Sideral Stallion – was a gregarious bard of Nicean and Opelenean descent who served as the herald of the original Grey Brotherhood. He had hoped his namesake, Raemon the Younger, would follow in his footsteps and become a man of lore and song. Instead, the young Raemon fell under the influence of his uncle, Horatio the Hammer, who had served as a crusader in battles across the Ammas Aurë. To honor his father’s legacy, Raemon has joined the re-established Grey Brotherhood; but he carries with him his uncle’s pious spiritual fire to spread the Empyrean faith and utterly crush evil underfoot.

**Description:** Raemon is a tall and imposing man with a handsome face and well-muscled body with dark bronze skin and wavy ebon hair. Those who confront him in his crusader panoply face a veritable wall of iron and sinew.

###### Tirenius Orn

**1st level Mage** (played by William Macris)

**Stat Line:** AC 0, Spd 40’ / 120’, HP 4, ATK 1 (staff 10+ or dart 10+), Dmg 1d6 or 1d4, Init +0, ML +1, AL Neutral

**Class Powers:**  Arcane Magic (1 1st), Collegiate Wizardry

**Languages:** Common, Classical Auran

**Spellcasting:** Caster Level 1; Spells per day: 1 1st.

**Spell Repertoire:** 1st – *slumber, thunderclap, weave smoke*.

**Equipment:** Wood-paneled spellbook, gnarled oaken quarterstaff, 5 darts, four-colored cassock with hood, embossed belt, low boots, backpack, quill and ink, waterskin, 1 week’s iron rations, 60gp (enc. 3 1/6 st)

**Background:** The only son of the wizard Zeodan, Tirenius was raised in the Tower of Knowledge in Aura. His costly apprenticeship was easily paid for by the plunder his father earned adventuring with the Grey Brotherhood. Tirenius proved an apt pupil with a predilection for calling on the power of the elemental sphere of air that earned him his robes at a young age. Though invited to stay on as a at the Tower, Tirenius had little desire to spend his life in perpetual study. Instead, he join the re-established Grey Brotherhood.

**Description:** Tirenius is a tall, husky man with curly hair and a long, pointed goatee that has gone prematurely grey. While air elementalists have a reputation for being as ever-changing and unpredictable as the wind, Tirenius’s personality is more akin to the darkening sky of a thunder storm – slow to arrive but inexorable and wrathful when it does.
