## Settlement Adventures

Adventures set within the bustling heartbeats of cities, towns, and other settlements present their own set of challenges and mysteries. Amidst the maze of narrow alleyways and grand boulevards, adventurers might grapple with political intrigue, navigate the underbelly of crime syndicates, rub shoulders with influential nobles, or uncover ancient secrets hidden beneath cobblestone streets. These rules offer guidelines for adventures in settlements.

### Sequence of Play

![](data:image/png;base64...)It is entirely up to you and your players how much or how little attention to pay to settlement adventurers. Some groups have built entire campaigns around settlement adventures, filled with crime, political intrigue, mercantile ventures, and similar shenanigans. Some groups prefer to treat trips to town as just a bookkeeping exercise in between sessions, preferring to devote their sessions to wilderness expeditions, dungeon delves, sea journeys, or military conquests. Most groups tend to do a bit of both, with the adventurers spending a session or two in a settlement in between major delves or expeditions.

There is therefore no hard-and-fast sequence of play for settlement adventures as there is for other types of adventure. Depending on the adventurers’ choice of activities, you might find yourself running settlement adventures on a turn-by-turn sequence as they sneak into the merchant guildhouse on some heist; running settlement adventurers on an hour-by-hour or day basis, like a wilderness expedition; or even just using the campaign activities rules between sessions.

For rules on how to construct a settlement, including stocking it with points of interest and dynamic generation of buildings, see Chapter 7: **Settlements** (p. XX).

### Movement in Settlements

Since tracking movement in feet per turn/round in even a small village would be tedious, movement across a settlement is better measured in units of **city blocks**. Blocks can vary in size, but so can traffic congestion, pedestrian density, road conditions, and more; handling movement block-by-block is a useful abstraction. When moving block-to-block, adventures can choose to move at **commuting speed** or **meandering speed**.

Commuting speed represents a pedestrian walking in a familiar neighborhood with a particular destination. At commuter speed, it takes about ten minutes (1 turn) to walk five city blocks. Characters moving at commuter speed must make a Navigation throw of 11+ every turn to avoid getting lost. If the characters have traveled to the destination before, but not by this route, add +4 to the throw. Characters who get lost end up 1d4+1 blocks away from their intended destination that turn. Once the characters have traveled a particular route before no Navigation throw is required.

Meandering speed represents a sightseer or shopper exploring an unfamiliar neighborhood, stopping to take in all the sights and sounds along the way. At meandering speed, it takes about ten minutes (1 turn) to walk one city block. Characters moving at meandering speed do not get lost as their slow pace makes it easy to see street signs or ask for directions.

Sometimes adventurers might prefer to travel by litter or wagon. This can afford an adventurer more privacy but is not any faster.

#### Straggling Groups (Optional)

Narrow streets and dense crowds make it hard to move in large groups. If the party is 7 or more characters, commuting speed is reduced by 50% (half speed). If the party is 15 or more characters, commuting speed is reduced by 75% (quarter speed). A party can split into smaller groups to avoid being slowed down but each group faces a separate encounter throw.

### Encounters in the Settlement

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Party**  **Location** | **Encounter**  **Frequency** | **Encounter**  **Throw (d6)** |
| Avenue (day) | Every hour (6 turns) | 6+ |
| Avenue (night) | Every 30 minutes (3 turns) | 6+ |
| Alley (day) | Every 30 minutes (3 turns) | 6+ |
| Alley (night) | Every 10 minutes (1 turn) | 5+ |
| Holed Up (day/night) | Every day (24 hours) | 5+ |

For urban adventures, the concept of the random encounter needs to be revised. A city is packed with people and an adventurer who even steps foot out of his room at the inn, let alone takes a walk down a thoroughfare, will almost certainly “encounter” random strangers – but these will be normal men and women with whom the adventurers will likely have little reason to converse. A random encounter in an urban adventure therefore represents some sort of unusual incident or interruption: an interesting public occurrence or happening that attracts the attention or the adventurers or an unexpected development which directly disrupts the adventurers’ planned activities and forces them to act.

#### Wandering the Streets

You should make an encounter throw every hour (6 turns) the adventurers are wandering avenues by day, every 30 minutes (3 turns) they are wandering avenues by night or alleyways by day, and every 10 minutes (1 turn) they are wandering alleyways at night. An encounter occurs on 6+ on 1d6, or 5+ in alleys at night. Some sections of some settlements (e.g. a Thieves’ Quarter in the Old District) might be even more dangerous!

#### Holing Up

Sometimes a party of adventurers might hole up in a particular building or neighborhood for a long period of time – perhaps because they are recuperating in a hospital, perhaps because they are studying in the municipal library, perhaps they are training in the mercenary guildhouse. Whatever the case, they might want to avoid any “interesting” encounters that distract them from their purposes. When adventurers are actively staying out of trouble, make just one encounter throw every day. An encounter occurs on 5+ on 1d6 (e.g. once per 3 days on average).

#### Looking for Trouble

Sometimes a party of adventurers might take to the streets to look for trouble. By purposefully loitering in busy places, hiking down crowded streets, talking loudly on interesting topics, randomly approaching strangers, shoving through crowds, and generally making a nuisance of themselves, they can increase the chance of an encounter. When adventurers are looking for trouble, add +1 to the encounter throw (e.g. the chances increase by 1 in 6).

#### Settlement Encounters Table

Each time a random encounter occurs in an urban settlement, roll 1d100, adding 30 to the roll if after dark. The following settlement encounters table can be used in most Class I – Class IV settlements. They assume the default Auran Empire system is being used, but you should be able to easily adopt them to the particulars of your campaign setting.

**01-04:** 4d10 beggars, many of them disabled veterans, have formed a human wall that blocks the avenue and are berating passersby to give them alms for their past services. 2d4 members of the City Watch will disperse the beggars violently after 1d10 minutes. Adventurers who donate at least 1gp to the beggars before the Watch arrives learn an interesting rumor. Adventurers who bribe or drive off the City Watch receive 1d4 rumors and a pledge of aid from the beggars in the future.

**Beggars (4d10)**: SPD 60’, AC 0, HD 1-1, hp 2 each, #AT 1 (violent beratement), Dmg just guilt, Save NM, ML -2, AL N, XP 5

**City Watch Officers (2d4):** SPD 90’, AC 5 (chain & shield), HD 1-1, hp 4 each, #AT 1 (spear or short sword 11+), Dmg 1d6, Save NM, ML +1, AL L, XP 5; Equipment: belt pouch with 2sp and 20cp each

**05-08:** A merchant’s wagon has just lost a wheel and tilted over, sending 3d100 stone of merchandise sprawling into the filthy streets. Choose or roll on the Random Merchandise table in the ***ACKS II Revised Rulebook*** p. XX to determine type. The merchant and his teamster are loudly arguing over whose fault the accident was. A character can quietly steal a stone of goods with a successful Pickpocketing throw at +4. Characters who assist the merchant in repairing and re-loading his wagon are repaid with 30gp and a city rumor.

**09-12:** A bard stands on a stool on a street corner and serenades passersby with songs of glory and valor. A crowd of 1d10 is watching. With a tip of at least 1gp, the bard will share 1d3 interesting rumors. With a tip of at least 20gp accompanied by a Friendly reaction roll, the bard will pledge to sing songs of their adventures. This will decrease the chance the party is mistaken for a rival party of adventurers (see encounter 29-32).

**13-16**: A pair of wagons have collided and are blocking the road. Neither merchant is willing to back up and it’s degenerated into a shouting match. The adventurers lose one turn (10 minutes) pushing their way through the thick crowd of 2d100 gawkers. Make an additional encounter throw.

**17-20:** A street magician is entertaining a crowd of 3d10 local residents. He is using his Prestidigitation proficiency to form pipe-smoke into phantasmagorical monsters and the spell *auditory illusion* to make the smoke-monsters utter gossip about the city’s notables. The street magician aspires to greatness and would be easy to recruit as a henchman (+2 bonus), provided the party does not embarrass or humiliate him before the crowd with superior prowess.

**Street Magician:** Mage 1; STR 10, INT 16, WIL 11, DEX 14, CON 9, CHA 13; SPD 120’, AC 1, HD 1\*\*, hp 4, #AT 1 (dagger 10+), Dmg 1d4, Save M1, ML +1, AL N, XP 16; Proficiencies: Collegiate Wizardry, Performance (street magic) 3, Prestidigitation; Spellcasting: 1st – 1; Repertoire: 1st – *auditory illusion, wall of smoke, weave smoke;* Equipment: Ostentatious robes, pipe, belt pouch with 6sp and 20cp

**21-24:** 1d4 proselytizers are seeking congregants. Roll 1d8 to determine their patron deity: 1, Ammonar; 2, Calefa; 3, Ianna; 4, Istreus; 5, Mityara; 6, Naurivus; 7, Turas; 8, a minor or foreign deity (Judge’s choice). Each character willing to listen to the good news for one turn (10 minutes) will be rewarded with a free 1st or 2nd level spellcasting of their choice. The proselytizers know one rumor, which they will share if reactions are friendly.

**25-28:** A town crier is announcing the news of the day. The news is mostly mundane matters relating to upcoming festivals, market hours, and temple rites, but the town crier is a valuable resource for happenings of interest. On a Friendly reaction roll, the crier will share 2d3 interesting rumors. Half will be specific to the settlement and the other half will be about the wider region.

**29-32:** A traveler stops the party and asks if they are members of “that famous adventuring party, the Imperial Vanguard.” (If you have already established a rival party, use their name instead.) If the adventurers say yes, he will ask for their autographs. If the adventurers say no, he tells them “I hope that Calefa blesses you with as much fame and fortune as them!” Either way, on a Friendly reaction roll, he shares interesting city rumor. For every bard the party has hired to sing of their deeds (see encounter 09-12), there is a 1 in 6 chance the traveler asks for them instead of Imperial Vanguard.

**33-36:** 1d4 members of the City Watch (as above) march past. If the party is wearing visible weapons or armor, they will stop them and ask them to state their purpose in Cyfaraun. If the party is argumentative, or already notorious within the city, the City Watch will seek to apprehend them. If outnumbered, the Watch will whistle for back-up, drawing 2d6 additional watchmen in 1d4 rounds.

**37-40**: A pedestrian isn’t looking where he’s going. Randomly determine one party member; that character must make a Blast saving throw. If the save fails, the pedestrian bumps into him. There is a 25% chance that the pedestrian is actually a 1st level thief. Make a Pickpocketing proficiency throw; on 13+, he stole the character’s coin purse.

**41-44:** A pair of rash young patricians mounted on light riding horses are recklessly racing through the streets. Carts are being overturned, merchant stalls shattered, and bystanders knocked aside. As the riders race past, each adventurer must make a Blast saving throw. Those that fail are splattered in the face by mud and filth thrown up by the horses’ hooves. The patricians will continue for 1d10 blocks before saluting each other and splitting up to avoid the City Watch. Adventurers who apprehend the patricians and hand them over to the Watch are rewarded with 10gp for stopping public outrage. However, 1d4 nights later, they will be assailed by 2d4 hoods hired to teach them a lesson about interfering with their betters.

**Patricians (2):** Fighter 1; SPD 240’ (mounted), AC 2 (leather), HD1, hp 7, 6, #AT 1 (sword 10+), Dmg 1d6+1, Save F1, ML +1, AL N, XP 10; Proficiencies: Diplomacy, Riding; Equipment: light riding horse, military saddle, purse with 6gp and 20sp

**45-48:** 1d4 bards accompanied by a venturer (their manager) are heading to give a performance. Roll 1d10 to determine the venue: 1-3, the local emporium; 4-5, a local cantina; 6-7, a local inn; 8-9, a local tavern; 10, a patrician’s private home. On a Friendly reaction roll they will share an interesting rumor and invite the adventurers to come watch them perform.??m

**49-52:** A wild-eyed vagrant in torn rags approaches the party ranting madly. Roll 1d10. On 1-3, he warns a death cult is preying on innocent residents. On 4-6, he shouts that doppelgangers have taken control of the settlement. On 7-9, he screams that ghouls are prowling the settlement’s dark alleys. On a 10, he accuses the adventurers of misdeeds and villainy. (Whether any of these are true is for you to decide.) On a Friendly reaction roll, the vagrant can be calmed down and will share 1d3 interesting rumors.

**53-56:** An abandoned rucksack has spilled open, scattering a cache of papers onto the ground. Mud and filth have ruined much of the paper, but two items remain decipherable with a successful Deciphering throw. The first is a journal with 1d4+1 interesting rumors written in a spidery but legible hand. The second is a treasure map to a point of interest in the region (Judge’s choice).

**57-60:** A bucket of refuse is suddenly hurled out of a high-rise tenement. Each adventurer must make a Blast saving throw. Those that fail are covered in human waste. This exposes them to the bloody flux, necessitating a Death saving throw at +4 to see if they become infected. Adventurers who fail the save become symptomatic after 1d4 days and are thereafter incapacitated for a week thereafter. (Those that fail on an unmodified roll of 1 instead die gruesomely at the end of the week.) See Diseases, p. XX.

**61-64:** A friendly NPC known to the adventurers (Judge’s choice) passes right by them without any sign of acknowledgment or greeting. If the party accosts their acquaintance, roll 1d10: On 1-5, their acquaintance apologizes; he was just preoccupied with business or other matters. On 6-10, the acquaintance just offers a vague greeting (“How have you been, chief?”) and quickly excuses himself; their actual acquaintance has been slain and the party has just met the doppelgänger who assumed his identity.

**65-68**: A sewer grate has gotten blocked up, and a puddle of refuse and waste has formed around it. The smell is nauseating, even by the city’s standards. If the adventurers attempt to clear the grate, they discover it was purposefully sealed. It can be opened with a spell like *battering ram* or with one turn (10 minutes) of tool-work. It leads to a hideout, monster lair, or other point of interest.

**69-72:** Beasts of burden are rampant in the streets! Roll 1d10: On 1-3, a team of 1d4 mules is braying, kicking, and biting passersby. On 4-6, a heavy draft horse has thrown off its harness and is galloping roughshod through stalls and vendors. On 7-9, a huge ox (STR 18) has broken loose of its yoke and is stampeding across the street. On 10, an elephant imported from far-off Somirea has gone wild from the noise and smells. Adventurers who can calm the beast will be rewarded by its owner with gold equal to 20% of the cost of the animal and will learn an interesting rumor.

**73-76:** A wagon has pulled into an alleyway alongside a storefront. 2d4 laborers are unloading trade goods into the store under the supervision of the store’s owner. There are 6d100 stone of random merchandise (see ***ACKS II Revised Rulebook***p. XX). On a Friendly reaction roll, the merchant will be interested in buying or selling this type of merchandise and will share an interesting rumor.

**77-80:** A shabbily dressed man clutching a large sack darts out of an alleyway, runs past the adventurers, and ducks into another alleyway across the street. One round later, a member of the City Watch emerges from the first alleyway and halts in confusion. If the adventurers tell the watchman where the thief went, they can gain a contact in the Watch. If the adventurers mislead the watchman, the thief will surface 1d10 turns later to offer his thanks. On a Friendly reaction roll, he will offer to introduce them to his syndicate. If necessary, you can roll on the Precious Merchandise table in the ***ACKS II Revised Rulebook*** to determine the nature of the thief’s stolen goods.

**Shabbily-Dressed Man:** Thief 2; SPD 120', AC 2 (leather), HD 2, hp 6, #AT 1 (pair of daggers 9+), Dmg 1d4, Save T2, ML +2, AL N, XP 20; Special: climbing 5+, hiding 16+, listening 13+, sneaking 14+, backstabbing (+1 die); Proficiencies: Gambling, Skulking; Equipment: sack of stolen goods

**81-84:**  A patrol of legionaries from the ruler’s personal guards marches towards the adventurers. There are 10 legionaries all equipped with banded plate, spears, short swords, and shields, led by a subaltern with a crested helm. If the adventurers are known criminals, the legionaries are coming to arrest them. If the adventurers have avoided such notoriety, then the legionaries are on patrol. Adventurers who stand aside to let the guards pass can continue on to their destination. Adventurers who do not stand aside will be forcibly pushed aside by shields and spear butts. Fighting the legionaries brings 3d6 members of the City Watch in 1d4 rounds. Adventurers who are arrested will face charges of assault, mayhem, and/or murder.

**Legionaries (10):** Fighter 1; SPD 60’, AC 7 (banded plate & shield), HD 1, hp 6 each, #AT 1 (spear or short sword 10+), Dmg 1d6+1, Save F1, ML +3, AL L, XP 10; Proficiencies: Fighting Style (weapon & shield), Manual of Arms; Equipment: belt pouch with 2sp and 20cp each

**Subaltern:** Fighter 3; STR 13, CHA 13; SPD 60’, AC 8 (plate & shield), HD 3, hp 13, #AT (1 spear or short sword 8+), Dmg 1d6+3, Save F3, ML +3, AL L, XP 50; Proficiencies: Command, Fighting Style (weapon & shield), Manual of Arms; Equipment: belt pouch with 1gp and 20sp

**85-88:** A crossbow quarrel darts through the air and kills a pedestrian just a few feet away from the party. To find out what’s going on, roll 1d10. On 1-2, the adventurers were the intended target, and the assassin is about to fire again. On 3-4, the pedestrian was a murderer and slain by the Order of the Eclipse under a contract of righteous retribution. On 5-6, the pedestrian was a bard who’d been spying on the local syndicate, which had him killed. On 7-8, the pedestrian was a merchant who refused to pay protection money to the local syndicate. On 9-10, the pedestrian had been snooping around the Tower of Knowledge and was killed by a mage to keep something secret. In any case, the assassin is hidden on the rooftop above the street.

**Hidden Assassin:** Assassin 5; DEX 16; SPD 120', AC 4 (leather), HD 5, hp 23, #AT 1 (crossbow 5+ or sword and dagger 6+), Dmg 1d6+2 + poison, Save F5, ML +1, AL N, XP 200; Special: hiding 13+, sneaking 11+, backstab ×3; Proficiencies: Disguise, Intimidation, Skulking, Sniping; Equipment: 50’ rope, grappling hook, rockfish poison (onset 1 round, dmg 4d6, save+1) on crossbow bolts, belt pouch with 10gp and 20sp

**89-92:** A pair of merchants are having a heated argument. Roll 1d10. On 1-3, it’s on whether to invest in preserved meats or cloth. On 4-6, it’s on whether to dump pottery or tools. On 7-9, it’s on the price trends for salt and beer. On 10, it’s on whether to invest in rare books or semiprecious stones. If the adventurers listen to the debate for 2d10 minutes, tell them the Demand Modifiers for those types of merchandise in the settlement’s market. If the adventurers want to buy or sell the merchandise being discussed, one of the two merchants will be willing to do each (e.g. one will buy salt and sell beer, the other will sell salt and buy beer).

**93-96:** A shifty-looking couple approach the adventurers.One of them holds out a coin purse. “What’s the word on the street? We’ve got coin if you’ve got anything…interesting.” The pair are carousers (0 level characters) assigned to a carousing hijink by the local syndicate. They carry 160sp and 20gp and will pay 3d12gp per rumor the adventurers share. (Hijinks pay off at 3d12x5gp per rumor so they’re making a good margin…) If attacked, the pair try to flee and warn the Brotherhood.

**Carousers:** SPD 120’, AC 1 (padded), HD 1-1, hp 3 each, #AT 1 (dagger 11+), Dmg 1d4, Save NM, ML -1, AL N, XP 5

**97-100: 4:** A bird circles overhead, shadowing the party. The augurs teach that the flight of birds can offer an omen of things to come. Roll 1d10 to determine the species and the effects of the omen. The effects last 24 hours. On 1-3, it’s an owl (+1 to all proficiency throws). On 4-6, it’s a dove (+1 to all reaction rolls). On 7-8, it’s an eagle (+1 to all attack throws). On 9-10, it’s a raven (-1 to all saving throws). Characters with Beast Friendship can recruit the bird as a henchman with a successful reaction roll.

**101-104:** A street corner prostitute offers services to a random adventure. The prostitute has a Charisma score of 3d4+4. A few moments of pleasure costs 5cp, while a night of pleasure costs 2sp. On a Friendly reaction roll (modified by Seduction, of course), a patron might learn a city rumor. Generous tippers (3gp+) will be invited to spend time with their new friend at her bawdyhouse.

**105-108**: As the adventurers pass a nearby alleyway, they spot a corpse sprawled across the ground. Roll 1d10 to determine the culprit: On 1-2, the victim was stabbed through the heart, then decapitated. Characters with Black Lore of Zahar proficiency recognize this as the ritualistic killing practiced by Dirgion’s doombringers. On 3-4, the victim has been partly eaten. Characters with Healing proficiency who make a throw of 11+ can identify that the bite wounds are from a particular type of monster (Judge’s choice). On 5-7, the victim has had his throat cut and a bloody sigil carved into his forehead – the sign of the local syndicate. On 8-10, the victim was slain by magic. An adventurer with Sensing Power proficiency might be able to identify the spell signature of the caster who did it.

**109-112:** A skirmish after dark on the streets is taking place between members of rival crime syndicates. One syndicate is fielding a slayer, two hoods, and three footpads, while the other syndicate has a torturer, three hoods, and two footpads. If the fight is not interrupted, the first side to suffer two casualties will flee into the darkness. Adventurers who intercede on one side or the other earn the gratitude of that syndicate and can, with a Friendly reaction roll, secure an introduction with its leader. The opposing syndicate will become Hostile if any of its members escape to report the party’s deeds.

**Syndicate Slayer:** Assassin 4; STR 16, DEX 14; SPD 120', AC 3 (leather), HD 4, hp 17, #AT 1 (sword and dagger 4+ or crossbow 7+), Dmg 1d6+4 or 1d6+2, Save F4, ML +1, AL N, XP 80; Special: backstabbing (+1 die); Proficiencies: Fighting Style (two weapons), Intimidation, Sniping; Equipment: belt pouch with 4gp and 25sp

**Syndicate Hoods (2):** Thief 2; SPD 120', AC 2 (leather), HD 2, hp 6 each, #AT 1 (sword and dagger 9+), Dmg 1d6, Save T2, ML +1, AL N, XP 20; Special: backstabbing (+1 die); Proficiencies: Labor (various), Skulking; Equipment: belt pouch with thieves’ tools and 16sp each

**Syndicate Footpads (3):** Thief 1; SPD 120', AC 2 (leather), HD 1, hp 3 each, #AT 1 (sword and dagger 9+), Dmg 1d6, Save T1, ML 0, AL N, XP 10; Special: backstabbing (+1 die); Proficiencies: Labor (various), Skulking; Equipment: belt pouch with thieves’ tools, 6sp and 20cp each

**Rival Syndicate Torturer:** Assassin 3; Str 16; SPD 120’, AC 3 (leather), HD 3, hp 14, #AT 1 (morning star 7+), Dmg 1d10+4, Save F3, ML +1, AL N, XP 50; Special: backstabbing (+1 die); Proficiencies: Eavesdropping, Intimidation, Swashbuckling; Equipment: belt pouch with 1gp and 20sp

**Rival Syndicate Hoods (3):** Thief 2; SPD 120', AC 3 (leather), HD 2, hp 6 each, #AT 1 (pair of hand axes 9+), Dmg 1d6, Save T2, ML +1, AL N, XP 20; Special: backstabbing (+1 die); Proficiencies: Gambling, Swashbuckling; Equipment: belt pouch with thieves tools and 16sp each

**Rival Syndicate Footpads (2):** Thief 1; SPD 120', AC 3 (leather), HD 1, hp 3 each, #AT 1 (pair of hand axes 9+), Dmg 1d6, Save T1, ML 0, AL N, XP 10; Special: backstabbing (+1 die); Proficiencies: Gambling, Swashbuckling; Equipment: belt pouch with thieves’ tools 6sp and 20cp each

**113-116**: A patrol of the three veteran infantry and three composite bowmen from the City Watch begin ramming down the door of a building. After one round, they push inside and begin apprehending the occupants. Roll 1d10 to determine what prompted the raid: On 1, it was a chaotic cult engaging in profane rites. On 2-4, it was a brothel with 1d10 prostitutes and 1d6 patrons that didn’t pay its bribes. On 5-7, it was a gambling house with 1d3 bookies and 1d10 gamblers that cheated an officer of the watch. On 8-10, it was a warehouse of contraband with 1d4 smugglers and 3d100 stone of random merchandise. Adventurers with Lightless Vision or Shadowy Senses will notice someone skulking out unnoticed by way of a side-window…

**City Watch Veterans (3):** Fighter 1; SPD 90’, AC 5 (chain & shield), HD 1, hp 6 each, #AT 1 (spear or short sword 10+), Dmg 1d6+1, Save F1, ML +2, AL L, XP 10; Proficiencies: Alertness, Intimidation; Equipment: belt pouch with 6sp and 20cp each

**City Watch Bowmen (3):** SPD 90’, AC 4 (chain), HD 1-1, hp 4 each, #AT 1 (composite bow or sword 11+), Dmg 1d6, Save NM, ML +1, AL L, XP 5; Equipment: belt pouch with 4sp and 20cp each

**117-120** 2d4 footpads (as above) have broken into a storefront across the street and are carting trade goods onto a wagon parked in the adjacent alley. Once they have collected 6d100 stone of merchandise, they depart for a warehouse in a nearby neighborhood. If interrupted, the footpads warn the adventurers not to interfere in “syndicate business”.

**121-124:** 2d4 hoods (as above) begin shadowing the party. If the hoods outnumber the adventurers, they attempt to rob them. Otherwise they simply follow them for 1d3 turns, looking for a chance to mug a straggler or departing character.

**125-128:** Screams erupt from a nearby alleyway. A young woman is being assaulted by 1d4 local hoods (as above). The dastards are drunk, violent, and happy to fight for their “prize”. If the woman is rescued, she turns out to a patrician of exceptionally comely appearance (with CHA 18 and Seduction proficiency). She was on her way to a secret triste with her paramour, a prominent NPC. Roll 1d10 to determine her paramour: On 1-2, it’s the head of the local syndicate. On 3-4, it’s the guildmaster of the merchant guild. On 5-6, it’s the ecclesiastic head of a prominent temple. On 7-8, it’s the captain of the City Watch. On 9-10, it’s the head of the municipal council. Escorting the woman to the safety of her paramour’s residence might (on a Friendly reaction roll) earn the party the favor of the NPC in question or might lead to them being… silenced.

**129-30:** Something truly unique happens! Roll twice and combine the two events, or make up something special.
