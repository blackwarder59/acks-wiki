## Magic Items

Magic items are the other, even more alluring element of treasure hoards. While characters are not awarded experience points for recovering and keeping magic items, they are highly sought-after nonetheless, as they grant bonuses and special abilities that can give parties a survival edge when they venture into ever more dangerous locations and face mightier monsters.

### Identifying Magic Items

Identifying that an item is magical is relatively straightforward – often the fact that the item is well-preserved when the other items around it are decayed and rusted will be enough. Even the most mundane-looking item can be revealed by a *discern magic* spell.

Identifying what an item is, however, is far more challenging. Depending on their class, level, proficiencies, and hirelings, the player characters might be able to employ some or all of the following methods to identify or at least partly identify an item.

* Any character in the possession of an item with permanent properties that are triggered on use or wear can discover those properties simply by equipping the item and experiencing the effect. He cannot, however, identify other properties of the item (if any) that might require command words or special circumstances. If the item is cursed, the curse will take effect when the character triggers the effect.
* Any character can identify a potion by sipping it to momentarily experience its effect. However, if the potion is poison, the poison will take effect when the character sips it.
* A character proficient with a weapon or suit of armor can identify its magical bonus (if any) by using it in deadly combat for one round or by dedicating one day to training with it. He cannot, however, identify other properties of the item (if any) such as special abilities, charges, or command words. If the item is cursed, the curse will take effect in lieu of the character learning the weapon’s bonus.
* A character proficient in Alchemy can identify a potion by examining its clarity, hue, odor, and viscosity for one turn (10 minutes) and making a successful Alchemy proficiency throw. (If the character fails, he cannot try again on that potion until he has gained a level.)
* A character proficient in Arcane Dabbling can trigger the effects of a miscellaneous magic item, ring, rod, staff, or wand useable by mages by making a successful proficiency throw. However, the character does not learn the effect until after he has triggered it, and on an unmodified roll of 1-3, the effect backfires. The actual command word and charges are not revealed.
* A character proficient in Loremastery can recognize a very rare or legendary magical item and discern its general method of use by examining it for one turn (10 minute) and making a successful proficiency throw. He cannot, however, recognize common, uncommon, or rare items, deduce command words or obscure methods of use, distinguish trapped or cursed items from safe ones, or assess the specific bonus or number of charges remaining in an item. (If the character fails, he cannot try again on that item until he has gained a level.)
* A character proficient in Magical Engineering can recognize a common, uncommon, and/or rare magical item and discern its general method of use by examining it for one turn (10 minutes) and making a successful proficiency throw. He cannot, however, recognize very rare or legendary magical items, deduce command words or obscure methods of use, distinguish trapped or cursed items from safe ones, or assess the specific bonus or number of charges remaining in an item. (If the character fails, he cannot try again on that item until he has gained a level.)
* A character with at least 5 caster levels or Loremastery proficiency can identify any magic item by conducting magic research (see ***ACKS II***p. XX). A successful magical research throw reveals the item’s exact charges, command words, and/or other properties.

When identifying magic items, a character cannot re-roll a failed throw until he gains a level of experience or discovers more information about the item’s properties or maker.

Note that the list above represents only mechanical (rules-based) methods of identifying items. The player characters can and should be able to interrogate prisoners, read captured spellbooks, closely examine wall markings, and undertake other tasks in the game world to aid their identification of an item. For instance, if an enemy mage with a *wand of fireballs* is captured, interrogating the mage might reveal the item’s properties and command word without recourse to expensive magic research. Of course, the mage might lie, or conceal certain properties or curses, etc. Such are the ambiguities that make adventure interesting!

### Using Magic Items

In order to use a magic item, a character must follow any procedures indicated in the item’s description. Some magic items are always in effect, but others may require special actions or concentration. Some magic items have limited uses, called “charges.” When items have charges, each charge can be spent for one instance of magical effect. A character will not know how many charges an item has unless he identified the item with Magic Research. When the charges are all spent the item becomes useless and non-magical. There is no way to “recharge” an item.

### Buying and Selling Magic Items

In any campaign, adventurers will seek to buy and sell magic items. Whether this is possible is entirely up to you based on the characteristics of your campaign setting.

In the Auran Empire campaign setting, buying and selling magic items is possible but difficult. The market for magic items is legally monopolized by the Tower of Knowledge and the various Empyrean Temples. The small number of buyers and sellers makes the market illiquid and inefficient. Most magic items found by adventurers were created long ago, and are of dubious origin and uncertain ownership history, which drives their price down. The majority of new magic items created tend to be for mage’s personal use and research, or commissioned pieces created for exceptionally wealthy patrons. Thus, magic items are generally available for sale only in small quantities, even in large markets. Buyers are equally scarce due to the high cost.

If you decide to permit the adventurers to buy and/or selling of magic items, the number of potential buyers and sellers of magic items in a month will be determined by the type of the items and the market class within which they are sold. The Magic Item Transaction by Market Class table shows the number of potential buyers and sellers for magic items of a given value in a month by market class. Feel free to modify this table if you prefer a larger or smaller market for magic items.

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Magic Item Transaction by Market Class | | | | | | |
| **Magic Item Price** | **Class I** | **Class II** | **Class III** | **Class IV** | **Class V** | **Class VI** |
| 1gp or less | 2,750 | 700 | 425 | 100 | 35 | 15 |
| 2gp-10gp | 300 | 70 | 35 | 10 | 3 | 1 |
| 11-100gp | 20 | 5 | 2 | 1 | 25% | 10% |
| 101-1,000gp | 7 | 2 | 1 | 25% | 10% | 5% |
| 1,001-10,000gp | 2 | 1 | 25% | 10% | 5% | 1% |
| 10,001gp or more | 25% | 10% | 3% | 1% | NA | NA |

###### Selling Magic Items

Adventurers can sell identified magic items found, discovered, looted, or otherwise acquired to the Tower of Knowledge (or your campaign’s equivalent thereof) at a market price equal to base cost. Adventurers can sell magic items they created to the Tower at a market price equal to twice base cost. The difference in market price reflects the difference in value between an item of known make and authenticity and an item of dubious origin and uncertain ownership history. Adventurers can sell items at less than market price in order to increase their chance of selling the item.

By default, magic items sold to the Tower of Knowledge are assumed to be used as samples and, eventually, components for further research and are removed from play. (You can, of course, decide otherwise for any given item).

EXAMPLE: Using a formula, Quintus and his assistants made 4 **scrolls of fireball** (base cost 1,500gp, market price 3,000gp). Quintus also has a **sword +2** he found in an evil crypt (base cost 15,000gp, market price 15,000gp). Quintus has a henchman take these to sell them in Arganos (a Class III market), giving him six months to sell as much as he can. Consulting the Magic Item Transactions by Market Class table, the Judge sees that there is a 25% chance of a buyer for one magic item of between 1,0001 and 10,000gp each month, and a 3% chance for of a buyer for one magic item of 10,001gp or more. The Judge rolls for one buyer for the scrolls in months two, four, and five, but no buyer for the sword. Quintus’ henchman returns with 9,000gp and the remaining unsold scroll and sword.

###### Buying Magic Items

Adventurers can buy pre-existing magic items from the Tower of Knowledge for a market price equal to 225% base cost.

EXAMPLE: Marcus is about to set out on an adventure from Arganos. He decides to buy **potions of healing** (base cost 500gp, market price 1,125gp). Stopping by the local Temple of the Winged Sun, he luckily finds one potion for sale for 1,125gp. Later, Marcus travels to the awe-inspiring city of Aura (Class I market). There he can buy 2 **potions of healing** for 1,125gp each.

###### Commissioning Magic Items

On occasion, adventurers might commission powerful spellcasters to create magic items on their behalf. Spellcasters powerful enough to create magic items for hire can generally only be found in Class I and II markets or through adventures. The advantage to commissioning a magic item is that the item can be made exactly to the adventurer’s specification. The disadvantages are cost and time. The adventurer commissioning the item will be responsible up front for paying the material cost and either paying the component cost or providing the required special components. If the spellcaster successfully completes the item, the adventurer will then be charged the research cost. The total cost will thus be three times the base cost!

EXAMPLE: Marcus hires a mage to create a suit of **plate armor +3** (base cost 35,000gp). After describing the elaborate appearance he demands, Marcus pays 35,000gp for the armor’s material cost. He also delivers the special component, the iron fragments of golems worth 35,000gp, to the mage. When the mage completes the armor, Marcus pays him the research cost of 35,000gp. In all the armor has cost 105,000gp.

###### Magic Item Availability by Market Class (Optional)

In lieu of randomly rolling each month to see what magic items are available for purchase, you can use the optional Magic Item Availability by Market Class table instead. When using this table, you roll once for each market in your setting to determine the number of magic items of each type, and then roll on the appropriate sub-tables to determine the exact nature of each item. These are then the items for sale from the various wizard’s colleges, temples, thieves’ guilds, or other venues in the market.

It’s up to you whether the items for sale change each month. If you want them to change over time, you can use the Magic Item Transactions by Market Class table to estimate the turnover of these items. Often it’s easier to assume they remain for sale until the adventurers purchase them or in-game events dictate otherwise.

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Item Type** | **Class I** | **Class II** | **Class III** | **Class IV** | **Class V** | **Class VI** |
| Potion | 37 | 9 | 5 | 1 | 50% | 10% |
| Ring | 9 | 2 | 1 | 30% | 10% | - |
| Scroll | 53 | 13 | 7 | 2 | 70% | 20% |
| Rod/Wand/Staff | 9 | 2 | 1 | 30% | 10% | - |
| Miscellaneous Weapon | 9 | 2 | 1 | 30% | 10% | - |
| Sword | 37 | 9 | 5 | 1 | 50% | 10% |
| Miscellaneous Item | 9 | 2 | 1 | 30% | 10% | - |
| Armor & Shield | 14 | 4 | 2 | 40% | 20% | 10% |

**Designer’s Note:** The economically astute reader will already have noticed that magic items cost thrice their base cost to create, but (unless commissioned) only sell for 225% their base cost. This suggests that the majority of magical items are sold at a loss. However, this is not really the case. If you compare the monthly research rate for a spellcaster to the salary of an NPC of the same level, you will see that the monthly research rate is approximately four times the spellcaster’s expected salary. Therefore a spellcaster who sells the items he makes for 225% of their base cost are fully recouping their hard costs and earning a level-appropriate income for the time spent. A spellcaster who sells his items for 300% of their base cost is actually earning more than the norm.

Moreover, there is empirical evidence that magic items would be sold for less than their full cost. That evidence comes from MMORPGs! In such games, just as in ***ACKS****,* “crafters” spend time and money to create items in order to gain experience, then sell those items in various in-game marketplaces. The developers of these MMORPGs have, mostly to their surprise, created functioning markets for goods and services that are nowadays studied (and sometimes supervised) by economists. Surprisingly, in every MMORPG that has ever existed, economists have found that crafters usually sell the items they create at a loss; that is, the price that players charge for the items they create in an MMORPG almost never covers the actual cost of the player’s time and resources in making it (especially considering the opportunity cost of crafting vs grinding).

The reason for this seemingly bizarre discrepancy is that crafters aren’t creating items primarily for profit, they are creating items primarily to “level up” in crafting, because that is the best way to become able to craft better items. This is, of course, the exact equivalent of the campaign XP that spellcasters earn from magic research in ***ACKS***. Because the incentives are identical in both cases, we believe that the magic economy of a fantasy world governed by the ***ACKS***rules would be similar to the magic items economy that has emerged repeatedly in MMORPGs. We therefore assume most spellcasters are happy to sell the items they’ve made at a price just high enough to cover their “hard” expenses (material and component cost) and a reasonable salary.

### Magic Item Descriptions

#### Potions

Potions are found in many sorts of containers, such as ceramic pots and glass or metal flasks. They typically contain a single dose which can affect a single drinker. Most are unlabeled, but can be identified by aroma, taste, or appearance in comparison to other samples. While potions of the same kind made from the same formula will share these features, and potions of similar kind may share similar features (e.g. potions with curative properties frequently are some shade of red), such identification is far from foolproof due to differences of manufacture, unreliability of information, and the wide variety of potions in circulation. Characters with the Alchemy, Dwarven Brewing, or Magical Engineering proficiencies can attempt more precise identifications with the corresponding proficiency throws.

A potion’s effect begins the same round it is quaffed. A potion’s duration is the same as that of the spell it grants, to a maximum of 1d6+6 turns; potions of spells with instantaneous duration (such as healing potions) remain instantaneous. A character who drinks a potion while already affected by another potion is **queasy** for 3 turns or the lesser duration of the two potions (whichever is greater), with both potions’ effects negated during that time.

A potion’s caster level is equal to the minimum caster level required to cast the spell it grants. Potions typically affect the drinker directly; potions allowing the drinker to affect others (such as a **potion of dragon control**) are esoteric. Oils are equivalent to potions but made to be applied topically to a creature or object rather than ingested. Some items listed in this section due to their physical similarity do not follow the above rules and are not true potions (**oil of ooze**, **oil of the secret fire**); they can only be created by spellcasters capable of creating permanent items. Unidentified potions have an apparent value of 25gp unless otherwise noted, comparable to a vial of holy water.

###### Healing Salve

This salve is an enchanted liniment based on camphor, wormwood, and oil. If rubbed on a wound, it heals the creature of 1 point of damage. The salve is found with 1d3+1 doses, but any given creature can only benefit from the salve once per day. Base Cost: 100gp per dose (cantrip). Apparent Value: 25gp.

###### Oil of Extra-Sharpness

This dark oil looks like the sort used to polish weapons and armor, but with a potent metallic smell. If used to oil the blade of an edged or pointed weapon, the weapon is temporarily enhanced to the equivalent of a magic weapon +2; weapons already enchanted gain an additional +1 while oiled. The vial contains enough for 20 arrows, 2 tiny one-handed weapons, or a single small, medium, or large weapon. The oil can also be used in doses of one-third each, in which case it grants only a +1 bonus, as **oil of sharpness**. In either case, the oil will evaporate 3 turns after it is applied. Base Cost: 2,750gp (Single charge 4th level effect, or 3 charges *Sharpness* 1st level effect = effective 5.5th level effect). Apparent Value: 25gp.

###### Oil of Ooze

This malignant grey fluid was first discovered centuries ago in dwarven alchemy labs. Upon escaping its glass flask, the fluid expands to form a highly acidic grey goo. If its command word is spoken as it is poured out, the pourer can control the grey goo by mental command, provided that he concentrates on nothing but controlling the creature. The grey goo lasts for up to a day or until dismissed on the controller’s initiative, upon which it dissolves into water. If the controller’s concentration is broken for any reason, or if the grey goo moves more than 60’ from the controller, control of the grey goo is lost and cannot be regained. The goo will also escape if the flask is left uncapped for more than one consecutive round. An uncontrolled grey goo attacks all creatures in its path until destroyed or dispelled. (For gray goo characteristics, see ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual***, p. XX.) Base Cost: 500gp (Single charge 1st level effect). Apparent Value: 25gp.

###### Oil of the Secret Fire

This bronze flask is sealed with a signet mark of a half-closed eye. It appears to contain good quality lantern oil, which if used normally in a lantern burns as expected for four hours. If instead set in a lantern prepared with a single hair wound about its wick, only the creature from whom the hair came will be able to see its light, his surroundings dimly illuminated to a range of 60’ when to all others the lantern appears dark; this *lightless vision* lasts for a day as the spell. If as many as four total users each contribute a strand of hair the fire’s secret will not last as long; the oil will still burn for four hours but its magical properties will only last for four hours in total. For example, if two users shared a secret fire, it would burn secretly for two hours, then begin shining as a normal lantern for the remaining two. The users would notice no change to the lantern’s illumination (though depending on their location at the time they might notice startled reactions from creatures around them). Base Cost: 2750gp (Choice of 4 charges 1st level effect or *Lightless Vision* 3rd level effect = 5.5th level effect). Apparent Value: 25gp.

###### Potion of Disappearing

This transparent potion contains enough liquid for six sips. If consumed a single sip at a time, the drinker and all his equipment gain the benefit of the *invisibility* spell but lasting for only a single turn. If drank in its entirety, the full effect of the spell takes hold, with the *invisibility* lasting an entire day. In either case, the user becomes visible again after attacking or casting a spell. Base Cost: 3,750gp (6 charges 1st level effect or single charge 3rd level effect = effective 7.5th level effect). Apparent Value: 25gp.

###### Potion of Dragon Control

This murky potion smells of burning flesh and cold sweat. The drinker’s voice becomes enticing and captivating to dragons. By addressing a single dragon within 90’ with riddle-talk he can compel it to obey his commands, as the spell *dominate monster*. The dragon can resist the effect with a successful Spells saving throw. If the dragon’s save fails, the domination lasts as long as the drinker remains within 90’ and continues conversing with the dragon in riddles, requiring his concentration. The dragon will invariably be hostile when the effect ends. Base Cost: 1,000gp (Single charge 2nd level esoteric effect). Apparent Value: 25gp.

###### Potion of Freedom

When imbibed, this woad-blue potion grants the drinker immunity to **paralysis** of any sort. He is entirely unaffected by the spells *halt humanoids* and *cone of paralysis*, by grave ghoul paralysis, by the paralyzing fear of hell hawks, and so on. Base Cost: 2,000gp (Single charge 4th level effect). Apparent Value: 25gp.

###### Potion of Giant Control

Sediment resembling tiny boulders rolls along the bottom of this strong-smelling potion’s flask. The drinker’s voice becomes deep, booming, and impossible for giants to overlook. By boldly addressing a single giant within 90’ with simple and clear orders he can compel it to follow his commands, as the spell *dominate monster*. The giant can resist the effect with a successful Spells saving throw. If it fails, the domination lasts as long as the drinker remains within 90’ and continues to confidently issue easily understood instructions to the giant, requiring his concentration. The giant will invariably be hostile when the effect ends. Base Cost: 1,000gp (Single charge 2nd level esoteric effect). Apparent Value: 25gp.

###### Potion of Hallucination

This cursed potion convinces its drinker that it is actually a different kind of magical potion (Judge’s choice or rolled at random, chosen at item creation). The physical appearance of the potion will be typical for the kind it appears to be: a **potion of hallucination (recuperation)** will appear as frothy apple cider, a **potion of hallucination (youth)** will smell of spring flowers, and so on. The potion imposes a powerful hallucination upon its wearer: a dynamic, multisensory illusion with no save permitted to disbelieve it unless he has the Illusion Resistance proficiency. The drinker will believe he is seeing, hearing, and feeling the effects he expects the potion to have, and find this hallucination so compelling that he cannot be convinced otherwise; in response to attempts to persuade him of his delusion, the drinker will typically provide an endless amount of rebuttals, excuses, and annoying refusals to listen. The hallucination will persist for the duration of the potion it pretends to be (maximum 1d6+6 turns), or until the drinker is **dispelled** or receives a *remove curse* spell. Base Cost: 500gp (Single charge 1st level effect). Apparent Value: 25gp.

###### Potion of Passion

This clear potion tastes slightly sweet in a way easily covered by other flavors. A humanoid drinker with fewer than 5 HD will spend the following day enamored with the next creature he lays eyes upon, as the spell *beguile humanoid*. If the creature he sees happens to be of compatible stock and sex, the potion takes far stronger hold; it will affect a drinker with fewer than 9 HD and leave him potentially smitten for months, as the spell *bewitch humanoid*. The drinker is permitted a Spells saving throw to resist the effect in either case. Base Cost: 1,250gp (Single charge choice of *Bewitch Humanoid* 2nd level effect or *Beguile Humanoid* 1st level effect = effective 2.5th level effect). Apparent Value: 25gp.

###### Potion of Recuperation

This bubbly potion smells of apple cider just beginning to ferment. The drinker of this potion will heal 3d6+3 points of damage, in the same manner as the spell *cure serious injury*. This potion may instead be sipped for a partial dose, with each third of a vial healing 1d6+1 points of damage as the spell *cure light injury*. Base Cost: 2,750gp (Single charge *Cure Serious Injury* 4th level effect, or 3 charges *Cure Light Injury* 1st level effect = effective 5.5th level effect). Apparent Value: 25gp.

###### Potion of Supreme Valiance

This potent blood-red drought tastes of the gods’ nectar to true warriors, but smells of carrion to lesser men. If the drinker is a fighter (or other character with equal or better attack progression), he will find his hand steadied, his eye sharp, and his body and spirit invigorated. For one turn, he becomes **immune** to fear effects, receives a +2 bonus to all attack throws, damage rolls, and saving throws, and gains 2d8 temporary hit points. The empowered hero is compelled to fight with heroic honor by attacking directly without retreat, in the same manner as the Berserkergang proficiency. Hit points gained due to this potion are temporary and are lost first on injury, unable to be healed. Base Cost: 3,000gp (Single charge 6th level effect). Apparent Value: 25gp.

###### Potion of Valiance

This flask of clear liquid warms like heady liquor when drank by a warrior, while to all others it tastes of sweat and grime. If the drinker is a fighter (or other character with equal or better attack progression), he will find his hand steadied, his eye sharp, and his body and spirit invigorated. For one turn, he becomes **immune** to fear effects, receives a +1 bonus to all attack throws, damage rolls, and saving throws, and gains 1d8 temporary hit points. The empowered hero is compelled to fight with heroic honor by attacking directly without retreat, in the same manner as the Berserkergang proficiency. Hit points gained due to this potion are temporary and are lost first on injury, unable to be healed. Base Cost: 1,500gp (Single charge 3rd level effect). Apparent Value: 25gp.

###### Potion of Youth

This potion smells of flowers and the early days of spring. Its drinker becomes 10 years younger, potentially reducing attribute penalties from age (though his age will not regress earlier than mid-adolescence). There is a cumulative 1% chance each time a person consumes such a potion for all effects from previously consumed **potions of youth** to be undone, causing the drinker’s age to suddenly revert to what it would be without their effects. A person raised to or above the maximum age for his race immediately perishes. Base Cost: 50,000gp (single charge 7th level esoteric ritual effect). Apparent Value: 25gp.

#### Rings

All magical rings are usable by any character class. To function, magic rings must worn on a digit of the hands only (fingers or thumb) or worn pierced through the flesh (like an earring). Regardless of where they are worn, a creature can only benefit from two magical rings at the same time; if more than two are worn, none off the rings function.

A ring’s caster level is equal to the minimum caster level required to cast the spell it grants. Anytime a spell cast from a ring triggers a Spells saving throw, the target makes an Implements saving throw instead. Paralysis, Death, or Blast saving throws are not replaced by Implements saving throws, however.

###### Anti-Magic

The wearer of this smooth black jade ring is protected by a 10’ radius barrier that stops any spell or spell-like effects from coming in or going out, including the wearer’s. Spell-like effects include all effects that duplicate a spell, or magical effects that are resisted with an Implements save, but excludes effects that do not duplicate a spell and are resisted with Death, Blast, or Paralysis saves. Spells with a range of “self,” or “touch” spells used on the wearer himself, are not blocked by the ring’s barrier. If a creature or item with ongoing spells or spell-like effects touches the barrier, it is dispelled as if by a *dispel magic* spell from the wearer, with the wearer treated as having a caster level of 11 for this purpose. Permanent effects or effects which cannot be dispelled are not affected, and the *anti-magic sphere*created by the ringcannot itself be dispelled. Base Cost: 72,000gp (permanent (1/hour) *Anti-Magic Sphere* 6th level effect). Apparent Value: 450gp.

###### Beast Control

This golden ring bears the shape of a lion’s roaring head, its mane sweeping back on both sides to form the band. Once per turn the wearer may command 1d4 living animal targets within 45’, as the spell *dominate beasts*. Each target that fails a Spells saving throw will obey the wearer’s mental commands as long as he maintains concentration, or until they cease being in range or are *dispelled*. After the effect ends the targets will invariably be hostile to the wearer. Base Cost: 33,000gp (1/turn *Dominate Beasts* 2nd level effect). Apparent Value: 600gp.

###### Feebleness

These cursed rings are often made to be mistaken for others and can take any form, but are typically a plain gold or silver band. Upon putting on the ring the wearer must succeed on a Spells saving throw or have his body and mind wracked with weakness. His highest physical ability score (STR, DEX, or CON) will be halved, and he will lose a rank of his mostly highly skilled general proficiency (if multiple proficiencies are tied, he loses the one he most relies on). This effect cannot be **dispelled**, but can be ended by *remove curse*. The ring only functions once; whether the victim makes or fails his saving throw the ring is thereafter non-magical. Base Cost: 1,500gp (Single charge *Bestow Curse* 3rd level effect). Apparent Value: 400gp.

###### Fire Protection

This ring is crafted from the polished blackened knucklebone of a red dragon. Its wearer is **immune** to mundane fire damage and automatically succeeds on associated saving throws. He is **resistant** to extraordinary fire damage, reducing damage by half and receiving a +2 bonus on associated saving throws. Base Cost: 24,000gp (Permanent (1/hour) *Energy Protection* 2nd level effect). Apparent Value: 40gp.

###### Genie Summoning

Set with small white sapphires, this silver ring can be used to summon a jann, a majestic genie of elemental air (see ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual*** for details). The ring is activated by rubbing it and whispering a command word; once summoned the jann remains for one day or until destroyed, dismissed, or **dispelled**. The jann will obey the wearer’s verbal commands obediently but not loyally, twisting any ambiguities in its orders. A jann with a neutral or better reaction roll usually only seeks to embarrass and annoy the wearer, but an unfriendly or hostile jann will find a variety of ways to sabotage the wearer’s efforts. The ring can be activated but once per week, summoning a different jann each time. Base Cost: 18,000gp (1/week 6th level effect). Apparent Value: 1,000gp.

###### Hallucination

This cursed ring convinces its wearer that it is actually a different kind of magical ring (Judge’s choice or rolled at random, chosen at item creation). The physical appearance of the ring will be typical for the item it appears to be: a **ring of hallucination (invisibility)** will gleam red in firelight, a **ring of hallucination (protection)** will be a signet ring, and so on. The ring imposes a powerful hallucination upon its wearer: a dynamic, multisensory illusion with no save permitted to disbelieve it unless he has the Illusion Resistance proficiency. The wearer will believe he is seeing, hearing, and feeling the effects he expects the ring to have, and find this hallucination so compelling that he cannot be convinced otherwise; in response to attempts to persuade him of his delusion, the wearer will typically provide an endless number of rebuttals, excuses, and annoying refusals to listen. The ring’s delusion affects the first person to wear it each week, and persists indefinitely even if the ring is removed unless the wearer is **dispelled** or receives a *remove curse* spell. Base Cost: 3,000gp (1/week 1st level effect). Apparent Value: as ring imitated.

###### Humanoid Control

This cold iron ring is fashioned in the shape of a clenched fist. Once per turn the wearer may command any living humanoid target within 45’, as the spell *dominate humanoid*. If the target fails a Spells saving throw he will obey the wearer’s mental commands for as long as the wearer maintains concentration, or until he ceases being in range or is **dispelled**. After the effect ends the target will invariably be hostile to the wearer. Base Cost: 33,000gp (1/turn *Dominate Humanoid* 2nd level effect). Apparent Value: 90gp.

###### Invisibility

This stout gold ring gleams red when seen by the light of a flame. With a twist of the ring, the wearer and all he carries become invisible, as the spell *invisibility*. The wearer becomes visible at the end of his initiative if he casts a spell or attacks a creature while invisible or if he is **dispelled**, but can activate the ring’s power again one turn later. Base Cost: 49,500gp (1/turn *Invisibility* 3rd level effect). Apparent Value: 350gp.

###### Plant Control

This ring is cut from green jade and set with interwoven vines of silver and gold. Once per turn the wearer may command any number of living plant targets within 60’, as the spell *dominate plants*. Ordinary plants are automatically affected, with all others resisting the effect on a successful Spells saving throw. Affected plants will obey the wearer’s mental commands until he ceases concentration or the effect is **dispelled**. Plants will gain some mobility, with branches and vines able to move to restrain and hinder the movement of others and perform similar actions, though they will not gain any ability to uproot themselves. After the effect ends any affected sapient plants will be hostile to the caster, while ordinary plants will return to their normal (lack of) behavior. Base Cost: 82,500gp (1/turn *Dominate Plants* 5th level effect). Apparent Value: 900gp.

###### Protection

These rings are typically crafted as a solid gold signet ring bearing a royal or patrician family seal. The wearer receives a bonus to his AC and all saving throws, which stacks with worn armor and any other enhancements to AC and saving throws. Most of these rings provide a +1 bonus, but some crafted with greater power impart a +2 or +3 bonus; a rare number of these greater rings also apply their bonus to saving throws to all creatures within a 5’ radius of the wielder, be they friend or foe. Ring +1 Base Cost: 12,000gp (permanent (1/hour) 1st level effect), Ring +2 Base Cost: 24,000 (permanent (1/hour) *Shimmer* 2nd level effect), Ring +2, 5’ radius. Base Cost: 36,000gp (permanent (1/hour) 3rd level effect), Ring +3 Base Cost: 48,000gp (permanent (1/hour) 4th level effect), Ring +3, 5’ radius. Base Cost: 60,000gp (permanent (1/hour) 5th level effect). Apparent Value: 250gp.

###### Queen’s Heart

According to legend, this bejeweled band was gifted by the goddess Nasga to her priestess Semiramis, the first sorceress-queen of Zahar. Though many of the hundred suitors who courted her attempted to succeed by sorcery, they found it to no avail: the wearer of the ringis completely **immune** to enchantment spells and effects as well as the influence of Mystic Aura. Once per turn by kissing the ring, the wearer gains *invisibility*,as the spell. Base Cost: 121,500gp (permanent (1/hr) 6th level effect 72,000gp, 1/turn *Invisibility* 3rd level effect 49,500gp). Apparent Value: 4,000gp.

###### Regeneration

This powerful ring was carved from the eye tooth of a great troll chieftain and boiled in the blood of his entire tribe to imbue it with power. The wearer of the ring regenerates 3 hp per round, as the spell *trollblood*. This regeneration is unending, even restoring mortal wounds; severed limbs will even crawl back to the wearer’s body and reattach as soon as they make contact. The ring only regenerates damage and mortal wounds suffered while it is worn, with other lasting wounds continuing to ache, bleed or fester. Injuries caused by fire or acid damage will never be regenerated, and magic or effects such as *extinguish life* that instantly slay the wearer affect him as normal. Base Cost: 150,000gp (Permanent (1/turn) *Trollblood* 6th level effect). Apparent Value: 60gp.

###### Seal of Chaos

This mighty signet ring is forged of adamant and hepatizon; in lieu of mortal heraldry its seal bears symbols of the chthonic powers. Its wearercan *speak with beasts*,as the spell. Bound to the ring are eight incarnations of varying power from the chthonic and elemental spheres, though legends vary greatly as to the specific incarnations and their powers. The wearer can conjure each of these incarnations once per day by speaking its name and concentrating, as the spells *conjure cacodemon spawn, conjure imp, conjure hellion, conjure incubus, conjure dybbuk, conjure fiend, conjure supreme elemental*,and *conjure genie*. If the wearer loses concentration or an incarnation is forced out of range, the wearer will lose control of the incarnation. It will then attempt to attack the wearer and all others in its path until banished, or until it departs 1d3 turns later; tales say such was the doom of several of the ring’s former masters. Unlike the spells, the ring’s incarnations can still be conjured the next day even if they were not safely dispelled previously. When the ring is found, the Judge should name each incarnation, roll or choose the type of elemental and genie, and roll or choose the form and special abilities of each cacodemon. Base Cost: 184,000gp (permanent (1/hour) *Speak With Beasts* 2nd level effect 24,000gp, 1/day *Conjure Fiend* 6th level effect 30,000gp, 1/day *Conjure Genie* 6th level effect 30,000gp, 1/day *Conjure Dybbuk* 5th level effect 25,000gp, 1/day *Conjure Supreme Elemental* 5th level effect 25,000gp, 1/day *Conjure Incubus* 4th level effect 20,000gp, 1/day *Conjure Hellion* 3rd level effect 15,000gp, 1/day *Conjure Imp* 2nd level effect 10,000gp, 1/day *Conjure Cacodemon Spawn* 1st level effect 5,000gp). Apparent Value: 8,000gp.

###### Telekinetic Force

This ring is carved from a single large amethyst, purple at its center with streaks of white crystal overlapping in a braid just under the band’s surface. The wearer feels potential connections reaching from his hand in all directions, as strings waiting to be pulled taut. With concentration he can move one chosen creature or object within 180’ weighing up to 54 stone, as the spell *telekinesis*. Each round he can move the target up to 20’ in any direction. Unwilling creatures targeted by or holding an object targeted by the wearer may resist the effect with a successful Spells saving throw. The wearer may cease or resume concentration at will, but affected targets will plummet from the air in the interim, and unwilling targets are permitted a saving throw each time he attempts to take hold of them telekinetically. Base Cost: 95,000gp (Permanent (1/turn) *Telekinesis* 5th level effect). Apparent Value: 6,000gp.

###### Water Walking

This thin gold ring has an inner band of perfectly clear glass, making the gold seem to float about the wearer’s finger. The wearer can walk on water as if it were solid land. He can freely attack those in or below the water, the water only acting solid for the limbs supporting his weight. He may freely choose to swim or otherwise submerge himself, but doing so will end the ring’s effect until he is again entirely above the surface; he cannot use it while submerged or partially submerged to propel himself upwards. Base Cost: 36,000gp (permanent (1/hour) *Water Walking* 3rd level effect). Apparent Value: 300gp.

###### Wishes

A perfect unmarked golden band made from otherworldly metal, this ring’s very existence is an imposition upon the natural order. To hold such a ring is to feel the weight of the sky as if it were crashing down on one’s head; to wear it is to feel the power to hold up the heavens. The ring contains 1d4 charges of the ritual spell *wish*, each able to alter reality in sweeping ways as the spell. Even among the greatest of mages in history, few have possessed the power and skill necessary to craft such a ring; the number among those who would dare the risk can likely be counted on one hand. While history and myth record several such rings, the difficulty of its creation and the strain such concentrated power puts on the world make it unlikely that more than one*ring of wishes* has ever existed at the same time. Base Cost: 800,000gp (4 charges *Wish* 9th level esoteric ritual effect). Apparent Value: 1,000gp, but obviously magical once touched.

###### X-Ray Vision

This silver ring bears a smoky topaz carved as a closed eye, with a disc of blue jade set beneath it as an iris. Once per turn the wearer may close his eyes to see from the ring, as the spell*x-ray vision*. By concentrating for the turn he may investigate an immediate area of up to 10’ x 10’ x 10’, discerning all hidden and concealed objects and features. He can see the contents of containers as well as any secret doors or traps, though seeing the internal mechanisms of locks and triggers will not necessarily allow him to work them. The*x-ray vision* can see through most materials but is blocked by even a thin layer of bone or metal. Base Cost: 82,500gp (1/turn *X-Ray Vision* 5th level esoteric effect). Apparent Value: 1,100gp.

#### Scrolls

Most scrolls are pieces of parchment, imbued with the magical writings of a spell or other magical effect. These writings are potent in that they simply require the pronunciation of their words to release their power. Scrolls are usually written in obscure or dead languages. You can choose the language in which the scroll is written, or roll on the table below.

Scrolls are sheets of papyrus or parchment imbued with enchanted writing. Reading these magical words aloud releases the power of one of the scroll’s inscribed spells or effects. Reading a scroll requires declaration before initiative and can be disrupted in the same manner as spellcasting; if disrupted, the spell is lost from the scroll.

Scrolls are often found written in dead or esoteric languages; you can choose each scroll’s language, or roll on Scroll Languages table, below, to decide. A character must be able to read the language in which the scroll is written in order to use it, unless he has the Scrollreading power. Spells from a scroll have the minimum caster level necessary for each spell. The apparent value of an unidentified scroll roll is 150gp.

###### Spell Scroll

A spell scroll will be found with a total number of spell levels on it equal to the amounted noted on the treasure table entry. Spell scrolls are split between arcane and divine, containing spells from the corresponding spell list. A character must have a spell on their class spell list in order to cast it from a scroll, but does not have to have it in their repertoire, nor be high enough level to cast it normally. A spell’s magical sigils vanish from the scroll when it is used.

When determining the contents of a spell scroll, first determine if it is an Arcane or Divine spell scroll, with even chance for each. Next, roll on the Spell Level by Total Spell Levels Remaining of Scroll table to determine the levels of the spells it contains, rolling as many times as needed and changing columns as appropriate. After determining the levels of the spells on the scroll, choose or roll for each spell on the appropriate spell repertoire list (see ***ACKS II Rules Revision*** Chapter 5: Spells). For a divine scroll you can either choose a single divine class to represent the creator of the scroll, or roll on the overall Divine Spell List; unusual combinations resulting from the latter option can be assumed to be the product of a syncretic or unknown sect. Individual spells on a scroll can still be used by any divine caster who has them in their class repertoire regardless of the scroll’s other contents. Apparent Value: 150gp.

| 96-100 | 6 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

###### Cursed Scroll

The reader of this scroll must immediately make a Death saving throw. On a failure, he is afflicted with a terrible curse, as the spell *bestow curse*. Any effect that would be appropriate for the spell might be found on such a scroll, but as those who make such scrolls strive to be as creative and cruel as possible the Judge is likewise encouraged to innovate. The curse may only be removed with the spell *remove curse*. Creatures unable to read the scroll do not trigger its effect. Base Cost: 1500gp (Single charge *Bestow Curse* 3rd level effect). Apparent Value: 150gp.

###### Scroll of Creature Warding

When read, this scroll produces a 10’ radius area of protection around the wearer, moving with him. The specified type of creature cannot enter the warded area, though they can still attack with spells, missile weapons, special abilities, and so on. The effect ends after 6 turns, or if any protected creature makes a melee attack against a creature of that type. It can be read by anyone literate in the appropriate language. The Judge can choose which creature type the scroll wards against, or roll on the Creature Type table on p. xx. Base Cost: 500gp (Single charge 1st level effect). Apparent Value: 150gp.

###### Scroll of Magic Warding

When read, this scroll produces a 10’ radius area of protection around the wearer, moving with him, as the spell *anti-magic sphere*. Spells and spell-like effects can not pass through the sphere, and any creatures or items passing through the barrier are dispelled as if by the spell *dispel magic*. The sphere persists for 12 turns, until dispelled, or until the reader of the scroll chooses to end the effect. It can be read by anyone literate in the appropriate language. Base Cost: 3,000gp (Single charge *Anti-Magic Sphere* 6th level effect). Apparent Value: 150gp.

###### Treasure Map

A treasure map leads to a hoard of the amount indicated. The Judge should determine the map’s destination and specifics based off this amount; for example, a map leading to a hoard of Treasure Type Q might lead to the lair of a Mummy Lord (a monster with Treasure Type Q). The detail given on the treasure itself can range from a general estimate of total value, to a detailed accounting with identification of and command words for magic items. All treasure maps will lead to the general vicinity of the treasure, though this might vary from leading to another room in the dungeon in which the map is found, to pointing the way to a small valley many leagues away in which the entrance to a lair is located. Beyond this the information contained in a map will vary, with some including a detailed map of the destination structure, locations of secret doors or traps, descriptions of guardians, passwords, or other clues. A treasure map may utilize unusual languages, codes, or hidden notes to keep some or all of its information safe, which must first be deciphered in order to use it. The Judge can choose to develop the map based on treasure or lairs already placed in their region, or roll on the Treasure Map Contents and Clue Specifics tables to randomly generate a map.

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Treasure Map Contents** | | |
| **Roll d6** | **Location** | **# of Clues** |
| 1 | Adjacent | 0 |
| 2 | Nearby | 1 |
| 3 | Nearby | 1 |
| 4 | Distant | 2 |
| 5 | Distant | 2 |
| 6 | Very distant | 3 |

If randomly generating a map, the Judge should roll a d6 twice on the Treasure Map Contents table to determine the general distance to the hoard and the number of clues the map contains. Distances rolled are broad and should be considered in light of the size of the hoard; a small adjacent hoard might be only a few rooms from where the map was found in a dungeon, whereas a large hoard might be at the bottom level; similarly, a result of “very distant” might vary from being hundreds of miles away to being on the far end of the world.

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Clue Specifics** | | | |
| **Roll d6** | **Detail** | **Content** | **Obscurity** |
| 1 | Brief | Local map of site or surrounding area | Obvious |
| 2 | Brief | Monsters present at or near hoard | Obvious |
| 3 | Moderate | Traps/hazards other than monsters | Coded |
| 4 | Moderate | Secret passages or doors | Coded |
| 5 | Detailed | Further details about treasure | Coded |
| 6 | Very detailed | Further details about treasure | Concealed |

For each clue, roll 1d6 three times on the Clue Specifics table to determine how detailed the clue is, what type of information it provides, and how apparent it is. For example, a brief obvious clue about monsters might simply be a basic note saying “beware the demon”; a very detailed concealed clue might detail the presence of a bound wyverine hellion named Bakl with magic resistance and a poisonous bite who will appear once the treasure is touched, in ink only visible while the map is gently heated. A local map might show the area around a distant lair or dungeon, an interior floor map of a lair or portion of a dungeon, or diagrams of noteworthy rooms. A brief mention of secret ways and traps might represent cryptic suspicions about a possible trapdoor; moderate to detailed knowledge might grant precise knowledge of mechanisms and destinations; while very detailed might provide passwords, keys, or other special means to access or bypass them. All maps should include at least the general value of the hoard; a brief treasure clue can further detail the rough volume and kind of goods present while a very detailed clue can give a full inventory, including the nature of any magic items involved and their method of activation. For coded or concealed clues the Judge can devise each clue’s ciphering or masking himself, or roll on the Clue Code and Clue Concealment tables, respectively.

EXAMPLE 1: Mandalfus obtains a map to a Treasure Type R. Rolling to generate the map, the Judge gets a result of Distant with 3 clues. The Judge decides the map leads to the lair of a monster with a type R hoard hundreds of miles away, settling on a very old red dragon who will reside in a destroyed dwarven vault. Rolling for the first clue results in a detailed obvious clue about monsters present, and the Judge decides the map includes an image of the dragon breathing fire while flying over the vault with a note “200 BE.” Thus the clue reveals the dragon’s age, body type and two of its special abilities. The second clue is a brief obvious clue about secret passages, and he decides the map will reveal the presence of a secret door into the vault, but give no further information about its location or how to open it. The last clue is a very detailed concealed clue about secret passages; he decides this will expand on the previous clue by including a key to the secret door along with exact information about how and when it can be used. Rolling on the Clue Concealment table, he gets a result of Moon Ink visible under a crescent moon. If Mandalfus uncovers the secret message, his expedition to retrieve the hoard will have less chance of ending in a fiery death.

EXAMPLE 2: Viggo finds a map to a Treasure Type B while in a dungeon. The Judge rolls to generate the map and gets a result of Adjacent with 1 clue. Rolling for the clue results in a moderate coded clue about traps. The Judge checks his dungeon notes and decides the map points to a statue elsewhere on the level with 500gp of gems cached inside along with a poison gas trap. Viggo is unable to decipher the clue but proceeds to the room anyways, deduces the treasure’s hiding spot, and smugly smashes apart the statue to claim his prize. As a toxic cloud surrounds him, Viggo wonders where it all went wrong…

If characters wish to buy or sell a treasure map, the price will vary considerably based on the usefulness of the map’s clues, the expected difficulty of obtaining the treasure based on distance and any known hazards or guardians, the presence of a particularly desirable artifact in the hoard, and many other possible factors. In general, a typical price for a “useful” map is approximately one-quarter of the hoard’s expected total value of mundane and magic treasure. However, a map with multiple copies in circulation is considered nearly worthless by most prospective NPC buyers. Prior to buying a map, NPCs will typically demand proof via magic or other means that the map is unique, authentic, and that its treasure has not already been plundered. An unidentified or undeciphered treasure map has an apparent value of 150gp.

#### Implements

Implements consist of rods, staffs, and wands. Physically, these three types of magic items differ primarily in size. Wands are small and thin, being about 18” in length and only 1/4” to 1/2” in diameter. Staffs are much larger, being 6’ in length and up to 2” in diameter. Rods are somewhere in-between these two kinds of items, being about 3’ in length and 1/2” to 1” in diameter. Wands and rods weigh 1/6 st. (e.g. count as one item) but staffs weigh 1 st.

Rods are sometimes usable by any class, but many are restricted to use by certain classes only. Wands are only usable by arcane spellcasters such as mages or elven spellswords. Staffs are usable by either arcane or divine spellcasters, depending on the kind of staff.

Each of these magic items generally uses a **charge** when its effect is triggered, and each item has a limited number of charges. A wand can be made with between 10 to 20 charges and found with 2d10 remaining. A rod can be created with between 6 to 12 charges, and found with 2d6 remaining. A staff can be made with between 15 to 30 charges and found with 3d10 charges.

Spells from a wand function at +1 caster level higher than the minimum required to cast them, spells from a rod at +2 caster levels higher, and spells from a staff at +3 caster levels higher. Some items listed in this section due to their physical similarity do not follow the above rules (**staff of the healer**, all ritual implements); as they are not true implements, they do not gain the bonus to caster level.

Anytime a spell cast from an implement triggers a Spells saving throw, the target makes an Implements saving throw instead. Paralysis, Death, or Blast saving throws are not replaced by Implements saving throws, however.

###### Rod of Cataclysm

Imperial history exists in in the aftermath of the Day Without Night, an apocalyptic event in which all prior history was reduced to ash and scattered to the wind. Sages of ancient history speculate whether the Day Without Night might have been brought about by the rod of cataclysm or similar artifacts; one legend describes such devices as the vast branches of a dark forest, seeded to end the world by an evil too great to look upon. Most agree this is a poetic turn invoking the rod’s age and calamitous power, as the cost to craft the rod would cause even an emperor to blanche, to say nothing of the dire notion of more than one such artifact existing. The rod is made of solid metal, a dense and dull platinum-like surface inlaid with a harder steel-gray. It is inscribed with abstract circles and portions thereof; despite appearing in no known languages, they impart a message of danger to any sentient creature seeing them. By tracing the entirety of the rod’s inscriptions, its wielder will invoke the ritual spell *cataclysm*. Unless the *cataclysm* is prevented by a *wish* or *miracle* or by the rod’s destruction, it will bring tremendous destruction against the targeted domain one week later. Along with its normal restrictions, the rod cannot be used against a domain with a ruler faithful to the Chthonic gods. The rod is found with 1d6 of its original six ruinous charges remaining. Base Cost: 1,200,000gp (6 charges *Cataclysm* 9th level esoteric ritual effect). Apparent Value: 500gp

###### Rod of Eternal Torture

This black iron rod is topped with a blood-stained bulbous tip and capped with a forked spike. Select servants of the sorcerer-kings of Zahar carried such dread devices to wrack the bodies and spirits of their foes, letting their lasting torment serve as a warning to any who might defy them. Any spellcaster can activate the rod by speaking the word ‘suffer’ in Ancient Zaharan, to expend a charge and disfigure a creature within 45’ as the spell *disfigure body and soul*. Only the magic of a creature with a caster level of 14 or higher can reverse the rod’s terrible effects. Base Cost: 36,000gp (12 charges *Disfigure Body and Soul* 6th level effect). Apparent Value: 35gp.

###### Rod of Nullification

At the end of this 2’ long ivory rod is an silver cap engraved with a broken circle. When any wielder speaks the rod’s command word it will instantly and permanently remove all powers from a magic item with a base cost of up to 200,000gp which is touched to the cap, with no saving throw permitted. Using the rod on an item held or worn by an unwilling target requires a successful attack throw. The rod can only be used once, its charge wasted if used in an unsuccessful attack. Base Cost: 100,000gp (single charge *Cancellation* 8th level esoteric ritual effect). Apparent Value: 2,000gp.

###### Rod of Resurrection

This 3’ long septagonal rod is comprised of unblemished platinum, on each side a prayer to one of the seven Empyrean gods flawlessly engraved and inlaid with gold. Each Empyrean god has granted a great boon to the mortal world in the creation of this item, from Ammonar the Lawbringer to Türas the Judge of Valor. The rod may be used a total of seven times by a divine spellcaster to return life to those that have fallen, restoring them perfectly from even the smallest portion of their remains as the ritual spell *resurrection*. Each *resurrection* is tied to a particular god and is best used on one of that god’s true believers, or at least a person who exemplified the qualities they most favor; using the rod on someone else will work, but at the Judge’s discretion may require a *quest* by the recipient for the god in question. The exact history of the rod’s prior use is uncertain, as the difference between *resurrection* and lesser magic is often only known to the newly-risen man who struggles with the after-effects of escaping death’s grasp; the rod is found with 1d6+1 charges remaining. Base Cost: 700,000gp (7 charges Resurrection 8th level esoteric ritual effect). Apparent Value: 7,000gp.

###### Staff of Domination

This narrow staff is made of blackened iron with chain-links of platinum set into its length. The wielder finds himself the prospective master of every natural living creature he encounters. Upon activation by an arcane spellcaster the staff expends a charge and allows the user to control his choice of another humanoid, a number of beasts, or an area of plants, as the respective spells *dominate humanoid, dominate beasts,* or *dominate plants*. Base Cost: 97,500gp (30 charges choice of *Dominate Plants* 5th level effect, *Dominate Humanoid* 2nd level effect, *Dominate Beasts* 2nd level effect = 6.5th level effect). Apparent Value: 800gp.

###### Staff of Elemental Air

Fastened from a thin length of willow, this staff is decorated with slim slivers of opal set after the shape of a roiling storm, a crystal orb in its head cradling a few flower petals in an ever-swirling wind; it serves as a reservoir of the might of the sphere of elemental air. This staff is one of the four Staffs of Elemental Power, created by elven wizards of Argollë at the height of that kingdom’s might. The staff can be activated by an arcane spellcaster via command word to expend a charge and cast any one of the following spells:*control weather, control winds, summon weather, cloud of poison*. Base Cost: 153,750gp (30 charges choices of *Control Weather* 6th level esoteric effect, *Control Winds* 5th level esoteric effect, *Summon Weather* 5th level esoteric effect, *Cloud of Poison* 4th level effect = effective 10.25 level esoteric effect). Apparent Value: 11,000gp.

###### Staff of Elemental Earth

Made of strong and unyielding oak, this staff is decorated with panels of precious metals set in an precise manner, a crystal orb in its head cradling an unmoving piece of polished granite; it serves as a reservoir of the might of the sphere of elemental earth. This staff is one of the four Staffs of Elemental Power, constructed by elven enchanters of Argollë at the peak of their kingdom’s power. The staff can be activated by an arcane spellcaster via command word to expend a charge and cast any one of the following spells: *earth’s movement, earth’s mire, earth’s hardening, earth’s tremor*. Base Cost: 153,750gp (30 charges choices of *Earth’s Movement* 6th level esoteric effect, *Earth’s Mire* 5th level effect, *Earth’s Hardening* 5th level effect, *Earth’s Movement* 4th level effect = effective 10.25th level esoteric effect). Apparent Value: 11,000gp.

###### Staff of Elemental Fire

Formed from a limb of red ash, this staff is decorated with triangular obsidian medallions set in sharp angles, a crystal orb in its head cradling an ever-smoldering piece of coal; it serves as a reservoir of the might of the sphere of elemental fire. This staff is one of the four Staffs of Elemental Power, crafted by elven fire-mages of Argollë at the noontide of that kingdom’s glory. The staff can be activated by an arcane spellcaster via command word to expend a charge and cast any one of the following spells***:*** *conflagration, firestorm, selective fire, inferno*. Base Cost: 153,750gp (30 charges choices of *Conflagration* 6th level effect, *Firestorm* 5th level effect, *Selective Fire* 5th level effect, *Inferno* 4th level effect = effective 10.25th level effect). Apparent Value: 11,000gp.

###### Staff of Elemental Water

Made of grey wood with a slightly blue tint, the staff is decorated with small pieces of aquamarine set in flowing patterns, a crystal orb in its head cradling an ever-churning sphere of water; it serves as a reservoir of the might of the sphere of elemental water. This staff is one of the four Staffs of Elemental Power, shaped by elven elementalists of Argollë at the crest of that kingdom’s expanse. The staff can be activated by an arcane spellcaster via command word to expend a charge and cast any one of the following spells: *level water, capsizing wave, ice storm, weave water*. Base Cost: 153,750gp (30 charges choices of *Level Water* 6th level esoteric effect, *Capsizing Wave* 5th level effect, *Ice Storm* 5th level effect, *Weave Water* 4th level effect = effective 10.25th level esoteric effect). Apparent Value: 11,000gp.

###### Staff of the Archmage

Oft considered the finest arcane implement ever made, this **staff +1** is formed from bone taken from the largest wing-spur of an ancient red dragon, topped with an emerald the size of a closed fist, and so intricately inlaid with platinum wire that the untrained eye slips when attempting to examine it. It was crafted by the legendary mage Süreus whose detractors claim that the staff’s expense harmed relations between the Tower of Knowledge and the Imperial treasurers for over a generation. The staff puts an immense array of spells at an arcane spellcaster’s command. By expending a charge its wielder can call upon any function of the **staff of the mage**, or can form a tunnel through any wall softer than metal as the spell *passageway*, *control weather* as the spell, form and compel portions of the primal spheres as the spell *conjure supreme elemental*, or halt all creatures in a 60’ long and 30’ wide cone as the spell *cone of paralysis*. Alternatively, expending a charge will allow the wielder to make himself or another creature or object unseen as the spell *invisibility*, to allow a touched creature to soar through the air as the spell *flight*, or to trap others to the ground as the spell *webbing*. Base Cost: 213,125gp (Staff +1 5,000gp, 30 charges choice of *Control Weather* 6th level esoteric effect, *Passageway* 6th level esoteric effect, *Cone of Paralysis* 5th level effect, *Conjure Supreme Elemental* 5th level effect, *Telekinesis* 5th level effect, *Flight* 3rd level effect, *Invisibility* 3rd level effect, *Perpetual Illumination* 3rd level esoteric effect, *Fireball* 3rd level effect, *Thunderbolt* 3rd level effect, *Cone of Frost* 3rd level effect, *Webbing* 2nd level effect, or 1st level effect = effective 13.875th level esoteric effect 208,125gp). Apparent Value: 8,000gp.

###### Staff of the Healer

This staff is made of rosewood, its head carved and gilded to appear as the sacred torch of Mityara. The staff brings a small mercy repeated a thousand-fold, rather than expending charges like a typical staff. Once per turn it may be touched by a divine spellcaster to a creature and activated by command word to heal 1d6 damage, as the spell *cure light injury*. Base Cost: 16,500gp (1/turn *Cure Light Injury* 1st level effect). Apparent Value: 1,500gp.

###### Staff of the Mage

This **staff +1** is among the finest arcane implements ever created, made of ebony inlaid with gold and lapis lazuli spiraling in multiple directions at once. The staff provides an arcane spellcaster with immense and versatile powers. Upon activation the staff expends a charge and creates the wielder’s choice of a devastating *cone of frost, fireball,* or *thunderbolt*, as the spells of the same names. Each blast deals 8d6 extraordinary damage of the appropriate elemental damage type to all in the affected area, with a successful Blast saving throw preventing half the damage and any other spell effects. Alternatively, a charge may be expended to move objects of up to 72 stone for up to 12 turns as the spell *telekinesis*, or to create a sustained magical light as the spell *perpetual illumination* (the duration elapsing if the staff is destroyed or depleted of charges). Lastly, the staff’s charges may be expended to impart force to a blow, as a **staff of smiting**. Base Cost: 126,875gp(Staff +1 5,000gp, 30 charges choice of *Telekinesis* 5th level effect, *Perpetual Illumination* 3rd level effect, *Fireball* 3rd level effect, *Thunderbolt* 3rd level effect, *Cone of Frost* 3rd level effect, or 1st level effect = effective 8.125th level effect 121,875gp). Apparent Value: 3,000gp.

###### Staff of Smiting

This **staff +1** is a stout piece of solid mahogany, hardened by bands of iron bound around its head. When attacking with the staff any spellcaster may expend a charge; should his subsequent attack roll be successful the attack will deal an additional 1d6 extraordinary bludgeoning damage. The staff still functions as a **staff +1** after its charges have been exhausted. Base Cost: 20,000gp (Staff +1 5,000gp, 30 charges 1st level effect 15,000gp). Apparent Value: 400gp.

###### Staff of Wilting

This **staff +1** is made of black oak, its top carved to resemble a shriveled and shrunken human head with inky sapphires set as eyes. This weapon was made not merely to fight but to wound and torture. A divine spellcaster can expend one to three charges when attacking with the staff. If he expends one and his subsequent attack roll is successful, the attack will deal an additional 1d6 extraordinary bludgeoning damage, as a **staff of smiting**. If the wielder expends two charges, the victim is additionally aged 10 years unless he succeeds on a Death saving throw; creatures with a short lifespan might instantly die upon aging. If a full three charges are expended, a victim who fails his Death saving throw will also lose one of his limbs, the appendage shriveling to a husk as the tissue withers beneath mummified skin. Roll 1d4: 1 – right arm, 2 – left arm, 3 – right leg, 4 – left leg. Once depleted of charges, the staff still functions as a **staff +1**. Base Cost: 53,750gp (Staff +1 5,000gp, 30 charges choice of 1st level effect, 4th/2= 2nd level effect, or 6th/3= 2nd level effect = 3.25th level effect, 48,750gp). Apparent Value: 4,000gp.

###### Wand of Fear

This bent wand of yellow holly is carved to resemble a cracked arrow, its false fletching painted white. Upon activation the wand expends a charge and produces a *cone of fear* as the spell, 60’ long and 30’ wide at its end. Each living creature within the affected area is **frightened** for 10 rounds unless it succeeds on a Paralysis saving throw. While **frightened** they cannot attack, cast spells, or speak coherently except to babble and scream in fear; they will flee from the wand’s wielder at full speed, cowering if unable to flee, until the duration ends. Base Cost: 40,000gp (20 charges *Cone of Fear* 4th level effect). Apparent Value: 40gp. Wand of Figments

This smooth wand is made from a long growth of spiked cactus encased in a layer of hard clear resin. Upon activation the wand expends a charge and produces a *phantasmal figment* as the spell, allowing the user to make a visual illusion appear within the bounds of a 20’ per side cube up to 360’ away. The user can freely move the illusion within the bounds of the cube; it persists for as long as he maintains concentration and for one round thereafter. Base Cost: 20,000gp (20 charges *Phantasmal Figment* 2nd level effect). Apparent Value: 120gp.

###### Wand of Fireballs

This wand crafted from royal poinciana has the wood along its length carefully scorched to appear as a succession of expanding spheres. Upon activation the wand expends a charge and produces a *fireball* as the spell, 20’ in diameter at a specified point within 360’. All caught within the blast suffer 6d6 extraordinary fire damage, with a successful Blast saving throw preventing half the damage. Base Cost: 30,000gp (20 charges *Fireball* 3rd level effect). Apparent Value: 24gp.

###### Wand of Foe Discernment

This wand is cut from a clean rowan branch with an indentation just above the hand painted in bright blue. Upon activation the wand expends a charge and allows the user to perceive every evil creature, object, or area in his line of sight out to 45’, as the spell *discern evil*. The evil entities appear to be engulfed in an unsettling red glow, which can be seen even if they are hidden or invisible. Only the user can see this glow, the effect lasting for 3 turns. Base Cost: 10,000gp (20 charges *Discern Evil* 1st level effect). Apparent Value: 70gp.

###### Wand of Frost

This wand of white pine is bound with a silver band at each end and a piece of polished white quartz at its tip. Upon activation the wand expends a charge and produces a *cone of frost* as the spell, 60’ long and 30’ wide at its end. All within the cone suffer 6d4 magic extraordinary cold damage, with a successful Blast saving throw preventing half the damage. Any mundane fires within the cone are automatically extinguished. Base Cost: 30,000gp (20 charges *Cone of Frost* 3rd level effect). Apparent Value: 120gp.

###### Wand of Impetus

This ash wand is marked at its base with a carved catapult, a tiny sapphire set as the projectile. Upon activation the wand expends a charge and flings one or more objects or creatures within 480’ a distance of up to 20’, as the spell*force of impetus***.** The wielder can target up to six creatures or objects of 12 stone (120 lbs) or less, or a single creature or object weighing up to 64 stone (640 lbs). Base Cost: 30,000gp (20 charges *Force of Impetus* 3rd level effect). Apparent Value: 400gp.

###### Wand of Item Negation

This wand of clean-cut ivory is inscribed with a precisely broken circle at the midpoint. Upon activation the wand expends a charge and renders a targeted charged or activated magic item within 180’ unable to be activated or triggered for 1 turn. This negation effect does not dispel any active spell effects already produced by the item, and permanent item effects are likewise unaffected; for example, a **staff of the mage** would still act as a **staff +1**, and the fabled **sword of fortune** would remain a **sword +1** that grants a bonus to saving throws. Negated items do not consume charges from activation attempts, though nothing useful remains of drunk potions, scattered **dust of revelation**, or similar. Base Cost: 60,000gp (20 charges 6th level effect). Apparent Value: 600gp.

###### Wand of Magic Discernment

This short, straight hawthorn wand is marked with a number of small holes representing stars, and a larger carving of a crescent moon. Upon activation the wand expends a charge and allows the user to *discern magic* as the spell. Areas, creatures, and objects within 90’ which are in his line of sight and imbued with or affected by one or more magical effects are visible to him in a pale glow, as if the moon shines on them alone. **Bewitchments** and **curses** cannot be discerned, and **invisibility** effects conceal both themselves and any other magic affecting their subject. Base Cost: 10,000gp (20 charges *Discern Magic* 1st level effect). Apparent Value: 70gp.

###### Wand of Metal Location

This wand is made of blue-stained oak with a lodestone embedded in its tip. Upon activation the wand expends a charge and will be pulled in its wielder’s hand to point in the direction of any concentration of metal weighing 10 or more stone within 90’. If multiple such concentrations of metal are in range, he will feel multiple forces attempting to twist the wand, only able to determine one direction per round. He can identify the type of metal detected, or the most common metal if multiple types are found in one deposit. Lead will be located but cannot be identified; the wand cannot distinguish between lead shielding other metals and a mass of solid lead. The wand remains useful for six turns per charge. Base Cost: 30,000gp (20 charges 3rd level effect). Apparent Value: 150gp.

###### Wand of Mage Missiles

This oak wand has a bronze cap at each end. Upon activation the wand expends a charge and produces a series of magic projectiles, one each round, as the spell *mage missile*. The missiles continue as long as the user maintains concentration. If concentration is broken, another charge must be expended to resume the stream of *mage missiles*. Base Cost: 10,000gp (20 charges *Mage Missile* 1st level effect). Apparent Value: 30gp.

###### Wand of Paralysis

This thin wand is made of gnarled oak, the knots in the wood resembling the joints of elderly arthritic fingers. Upon activation the wand expends a charge and produces a *cone of paralysis* as the spell, 60’ long and 30’ wide at its end. Each creature within the affected area is **paralyzed** for 6 turns unless it succeeds on a Paralysis saving throw, tendons tightening into place and joints grinding to a halt. Base Cost: 50,000gp (20 charges *Cone of Paralysis* 5th level effect). Apparent Value: 20gp.

###### Wand of Thunderbolts

This mahogany wand has wavering grooves running down its entire length. Upon activation the wand expends a charge and produces a *thunderbolt* as the spell, 5’ wide and 120’ long. All within the bolt’s path suffer 6d6 extraordinary electric damage and are deafened, with a successful Blast saving throw preventing the deafness and half the damage. As with the spell, a bolt from the wand may deflect off barriers that it is too weak to shatter. Base Cost: 30,000gp (20 charges *Thunderbolt* 3rd level effect). Apparent Value: 25gp.

###### Wand of Transformation

Made of oak, rowan, and maple, the woods of this wand blend as if saplings were spliced and made to grow together. The wand may be used with a touch to transform a living creature of up to man-size. If transforming the user it functions as the spell *transform self*: He takes the form of a creature of his choice of up to 12 HD or twice his own HD (whichever is lower). The transformation lasts for 3 hours, with the user able to end the effect at will. If used on another creature it functions as the spell *transform other*: The target is forced to take the form of a living creature chosen by the user of not more than twice his HD or 12 HD (whichever is lower). An unwilling target resists the effect on a successful Spells saving throw, and unless the target is helpless the user must also make a successful attack throw to touch him with the wand. A victim transformed in this way retains the form perpetually until he dies, the effect is **dispelled**, or the wand is destroyed or depleted of charges. In either use, the transformed creature gains all its physical and special attacks and characteristics of its new form, but retains its own mind and hit points. The wand cannot change its target into a duplicate of a specific individual, nor into a creature with more than one special ability (\*), an incorporeal or gaseous creature, or a construct, elemental, or undead. Any form created by the wand is sterile. Base Cost: 90,000gp (20 charges choice of *Transform Self* 6th level or *Transform Other* 6th level = 9th level effect). Apparent Value: 700gp.

#### Miscellaneous Magic Items

Whether permanent, periodically usable, or charged, magic effects can be worked into almost any physical object. Miscellaneous items can be used by any character unless indicated otherwise.

The caster level for a miscellaneous item’s effect is equal to the lowest caster level needed to cast that level of spell. Anytime a spell cast from a miscellaneous magic item triggers a Spells saving throw, the target makes an Implements saving throw instead. Paralysis, Death, or Blast saving throws are not replaced by Implements saving throws, however.

###### Amulet of Indiscernibility

This glass pendant hangs from an electrum chain, a golden sphere at its core barely visible through swirls of black and gray. The pendant blocks *scrying* or *locating* the wearer or items on his person, and he can automatically refuse an attempt to establish a telepathic link, as the spell *indiscernibility*. Anyone attempting to *scry* or telepathically contact the wearer will know only that he is protected from the effect, with no further details about how or why; if the wearer himself can cast *scry,* he has the normal chance to notice scrying attempts against him. Base Cost: 30,000gp (Permanent (1/day) *Indiscernibility* 4th level esoteric effect). Apparent Value: 2,000gp.

###### Bag of Oblivion

Resembling a **bottomless bag**, this bag can be distinguished by its bronze threads shining brighter than the gold threads of its counterpart. Like the **bottomless bag**, this bag can hold items totaling up to 100 stone within its 10’ x 5’ x 3’ volume. Its contents are not safely stored, however; each item disappears after being in the bag for 1d12 turns as soon as the bag is closed. Items which vanish in this manner are typically lost forever, though at the Judge’s discretion creatures lost within may find themselves on distant worlds, legendary artifacts may be freshly interred deep in ancient dungeons, and so forth. Base Cost: 72,000gp (Permanent (1/hour) 6th level esoteric effect). Apparent Value: 15gp.

###### Basin of Conjuring Water Elementals

This basin is made of deep blue glass cut with a pattern of whorls and waves. Once per day when the basin is filled to its brim with clean water, the user may speak an invocation to conjure a **12 HD elemental** from the Elemental Sphere of Water (see the ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual*** for details), as the spell *conjure major elemental*. The elemental will obey its master’s will so long as he maintains concentration, for up to 13 turns. He can dismiss the elemental at will to return it to its native sphere, but will lose control if his concentration is lost or the elemental moves more than 360’ away from him. An uncontrolled elemental will attack him and his allies before returning to its native sphere; it may not be banished by further use of the basin, only by spells such as *counterspell, dispel magic,* or *dispel evil.* Base Cost: 20,000gp (1/day *Conjure Major Elemental* 4th level effect). Apparent Value: 300gp.

###### Belt of Dwarvenkind

Created to honor Prefect Franco Scaramuccius for his vital aid during the Beastmen Wars, this splendid belt is layered with golden links, its large buckle a solid platinum depiction of a particularly proud and imperious dwarven face. In their gratitude the Meniri dwarves fashioned the belt to bestow upon its wearer the greatest of all boons: making him like a dwarf. The wearer gains all racial traits of a dwarf: their **hardy nature**, **sensitivity to rock and stone**, and ability to speak and read the **dwarf tongues**. The wearer’s beard grows twice as fast, and his mannerisms become more dwarflike; this grants him a +1 bonus to the reactions, loyalty, and morale of dwarves, but a -1 penalty to the reactions, loyalty, and morale of humans and other demi-humans (gnomes and halflings excepted), who perceive him as exhibiting the worst of dwarven foibles. Whether the Prefect wore this belt after its presentation is a detail sadly missing from the historical record. Base Cost: 76,000gp. Permanent (1/3 turns) 4th level effect. Apparent Value: 4,000gp.

###### Belt of Giant Strength

A mountain’s peak is embossed on the buckle of this tall leather belt. The belt can be worn by a small or man-sized creature, but not by anything larger. The wearer is imbued with the strength of a giant; he gains +2 to melee attack throws and deals an additional die of damage with every physical attack. If his attack already deals a set of damage dice, it deals an additional set of damage dice with every physical attack (e.g. 4d6 instead of 2d6). He also gains a +8 bonus to Dungeonbashing proficiency throws and doubles his normal carrying capacity. The effects of this belt, as with the spell *giant strength*, do not stack with any other effects that influence strength or size, only with the natural prowess (or lack thereof) of the wearer; a strong wearer has the strength of a strong giant while a runt of a man gains the strength of a runt of a giant. Base Cost: 76,000gp (Permanent (1/3 turn) *Giant Strength* 4th level effect). Apparent Value: 1,200gp.

###### Boots of Bounding

These boots are made of supple goatskin with a springy slice of cork as an insole. The wearer can leap 10’ vertically and 30’ horizontally from a standing start. He also gains a +8 bonus on Acrobatics proficiency throws and needs no rest if engaged in ordinary movement, as the spell *leaping*. Base Cost: 19,000gp (Permanent (1/3 turn) *Leaping* 1st level effect). Apparent Value: 30gp.

###### Boots of Levitating

These lightweight high boots are adorned with small cloudy spinels up each side. The wearer may tap the boots together and point the toes up or down to move vertically up to 20’ per round while carrying up to his maximum load. This power requires concentration when used, but not to remain aloft. The wearer cannot float horizontally, but may push and pull his way along walls and ceilings at half his ordinary speed. While airborne the wearer makes attacks with an increasing penalty until he takes a round of concentration to stabilize himself, as the spell *levitation*. Base Cost: 47,500gp (Permanent (1/hour) *Levitation* 2nd level effect). Apparent Value: 150gp.

###### Boots of Striding

These low-cut horseleather boots are each dyed with a scarlet sunrise and a violet sunset. Once per day the wearer may activate the boots by stretching down and touching the toes with both hands to double his land speed for the next 12 hours. The effect will end early if **dispelled** or if the boots are removed. The wearer is left **fatigued** after the effect ends, suffering a cumulative -1 penalty on attack throws, proficiency throws, saving throws, and damage rolls until he rests as his dedicated activity for a day and gets 8 hours of restful sleep. Base Cost: 10,000gp (1/day 2nd level effect). Apparent Value: 35gp.

###### Boots of the Elven Ranger

These soft suede boots are cut low and dyed a mottled gray, and in ages past were crafted solely by the elves for the famed archers patrolling their homelands. The wearer of the boots gains a naturally delicate step, allowing him to move totally silently with a successful Sneaking proficiency throw of 12+. If he is already proficient in Sneaking, he instead gains a +8 bonus to his Sneaking proficiency throws, as the spell *silent step*. Base Cost: 19,000gp (Permanent (turn/level) *Silent Step* 1st level effect). Apparent Value: 20gp.

###### Boots of the Prizefighter

These flashy boots gleaming with rows of gold studs and sapphires set into their thick black leather were once owned by a succession of champion dwarven pugilists. Their wearer floats nimbly like a butterfly over the battlefield, receiving a +2 bonus to AC as well as a +2 bonus to saving throws where agility would help avoid the situation, such as tilting floors and pit traps. The wearer’s quickened steps aid him in a number of dirty fighting moves. With a successful proficiency throw in lieu of moving, he can swiftly slip around an opponent and attack from the rear, as though he had the Acrobatics proficiency. When using a Force Back or Knock Down special maneuver in combat, the wearer suffers only a -2 penalty to his attack throw rather than the normal -4, and his opponent suffers a -2 penalty to his saving throw against the maneuver if struck. If the wearer already has the corresponding Combat Trickery proficiency for the maneuver, he instead suffers only a -1 penalty to his attack throw, and his opponent suffers a -3 penalty to his saving throw. Base Cost: 76,000gp. 4 permanent (1/3 turns) 1st level effects 19,000gp each. Apparent Value: 3,000gp.

###### Bottomless Bag

This small sack has incredibly sturdy craftsmanship, each seam triply-stitched in bronze, silver, and gold colored threads. The bag’s room within is far beyond its apparent size without; it is able to hold objects up to 10’ x 5’ x 3’ in volume and up to 100 stone total weight. The bag’s weight increases normally as items are added until it reaches 6 stone, with further objects adding no further encumbrance. An otherwise-empty bag contains enough air inside for a single person to breathe for 72 turns, with multiple people inside dividing that time by the number present. Base Cost: 100,000gp (Permanent (1/turn) 4th level esoteric effect). Apparent Value: 45gp.

###### Bracers of Armor

Crafted of hardened leather or embellished metal, these thin arm guards grant a magical bonus equivalent to that of armor. Typically made for mages or priestesses, these bracers allow an unarmored character to gain bonus to AC as if wearing armor. Like actual armor, and unlike *arcane armor* or *divine armor*, the AC bonus from the bracer stacks with most other modifiers to AC. Base Cost: Bracers +1 5,000gp, Bracers +2 15,000gp, Bracers +3 35,000gp, Bracers +4 65,000gp, Bracers +5 105,000gp, Bracers +6 155,000gp, Bracers +7 215,000gp. Apparent Value: 150gp.

###### Brooch of Arcane Armor

This silver brooch for fastening a cloak is in the shape of a shield with heraldry detailed in gold wire. The brooch creates a weightless and invisible suit of armor around its wearer, guaranteeing him AC 7 against missile attacks and AC 5 against melee attacks, as the spell *arcane armor*. This protection stacks with modifiers to AC from DEX but not with modifiers to AC from armor, class powers, conditions, magic, or proficiencies. The brooch also renders its wearer **immune** to *mage missiles*, whether cast by a spellcaster or from a magic item. Base Cost: 19,000gp (Permanent (1/3 turns) 1st level effect). Apparent Value: 250gp.

###### Candle of Contemplation

These tapered, silver-flecked candles are typically found in bundles of 1d4 and emit a rich, earthy scent when lit. A spellcaster holding a lit candle for the full hour it burns can focus on its flickering flame and calming aroma to refresh his mind, regaining the ability to cast a spell of a level he had previously expended. A craftpriest might perform this contemplation while reciting prayers, a mage in silent thought, a shaman while dancing and chanting, and so on, as befits their magical tradition. A spellcaster may not in the same day regain the same level of spell through the use of candles or the Contemplation proficiency. Base Cost: 500gp (single charge 1st level effect). Single charge 1st level effect. Apparent Value: 10gp each.

###### Censer of Prophetic Dreams

This gold and silver incense burner is adorned with intricate religious iconography. To use the thurible, a divine spellcaster must light a stick of rare incense worth at least 20gp on his god’s holiest day of the week. The thurible will begin to produce a magical smoke with a heavenly aroma. If the person who lit the incense then goes to sleep within 10’ of the censer, he will awaken 2d4 hours later from a vivid *prophetic dream* sent by the gods, as the spell. The dream will convey a short piece of true, meaningful, and important information about a person, settlement, domain, realm, object, or event of interest to the user. However, the dream may be misunderstood due to cryptic symbolism and esoteric meaning; if the user misinterprets the dream or doesn’t act on the information, conditions may change so that the information ceases to be useful. If the thurible is used on the wrong day of the week, or by a person who is not a divine caster, it causes awful night terrors that deny the sleeper his night’s rest. Base Cost: 18,000gp (1/week *Prophetic Dream* 6th level esoteric effect). Apparent Value: 600gp.

###### Chalice of Blood

This infamous silver and bone goblet can grant a person the strength and knowledge of his slain foes. It is said that the first blood the chalice tasted was that of its own creator, the dark lord Theophanous, who tore out his own heart and drank its hot leakage from the cup to better embrace his newfound undeath without the weakness of heart-felt pity or compassion. To use the chalice, a person must first fill its cup with the blood of a sapient victim slain within the last round, and drink. The victim must make a Death saving throw as the chalice’s black magic works to bind his soul before it can depart. If the saving throw succeeds, the victim’s soul escapes; the drinker gains but a portion of the victim’s strength, receiving 1d10+3 temporary hit points which last for three hours. If the saving throw fails, the drinker consumes the victim’s soul; he instead receives 2d10+3 temporary hit points plus an additional 1 temporary hp per level of the victim, which last for an entire day. In addition, consuming the soul grants the drinker some important knowledge possessed by the victim, and prevents the victim being restored to life, as the spell *soul eating.* The chalice can be used once per turn, provided sufficient victims are available. If a person uses the chalice while already affected by its power, the temporary hp and memories from additional victims are cumulative with those already granted, to a maximum of 27 temporary hp. The drinker is treated as an inherently evil summoned creature for purposes of *discern evil* and *holy circle* while benefiting from the chalice’s magic; the knowledge and strength it grants can be stripped away by a successful *counterspell, dispel evil*or *dispel magic*. Base Cost: 132,000gp (1/turn *Soul Eating* 6th level effect 99,000gp, 1/turn *Necromantic Potence* 2nd level effect 33,000gp). Apparent Value: 500gp.

###### Chariot of the Gods

This chariot is a magnificent wheeled vehicle constructed from slates of dawn redwood and reinforced with bronze. The chariot is built with the same characteristics as an ordinary chariot (see the **Equipment Descriptions** in ***ACKS II Revised Rulebook***, Chapter 4), but with increased SHP and twice the speed, as shown in the Chariot of the Gods table. Unlike ordinary chariots, this mighty vehiclecan traverse thin air as if it were solid, level ground; when hitched to flying creatures capable of pulling it, it can soar through the heavens as easily as an ordinary chariot traverses the battlefield or race-course. Any time the chariot is in the air it glows brilliantly, as the spell *perpetual illumination*. The chariot, its driver, and its passengers benefit from *deflect ordinary missiles* as the spell, as well as *energy resistance*to cold, fire, and electric damage. The Judge should roll 1d6 to determine the chariot’s size: 1-2, light; 3-4, medium; 5-6 heavy. Base Cost: 263,500gp (permanent (turn/level) 4th level effect 76,000gp (air traversal), permanent (1/3 turns) 3rd level effect 57,000gp (deflection), 3 permanent (1/hour) 3rd level effects 36,000 each (energy resistance), permanent (1/day) *Perpetual Illumination* 2nd level esoteric effect 22,500gp). Apparent Value: 1,920gp.

###### Chime of Unlocking

This crystal bell is set on an ivory handle. When the bell is struck it expends a charge and suppresses any *magic lock* or *seal portal* spells within a 5’ radius of the location where the bell was struck. While suppressed, any doors and containers can be opened as if they were not magically sealed by either of the two spells; after 3 turns have passed the normal effects of the spells will return, with doors and lids springing closed if not barred from doing so. The chime has no effect on mundane locks, bars, and barricades; it is found with 2d4 charges remaining. Base Cost: 8,000gp (8 charges 2nd level effect). Apparent Value: 300gp.

###### Cloak of Protection

This cloak is made of brown wool with a silver clasp, shimmering slightly when worn as if seen through a haze. The wearer of the cloak receives a bonus to his AC and all saving throws, which stacks with worn armor and any other enhancements to AC and saving throws. Most of these cloaks provide a +1 bonus, but some crafted with greater power impart a +2 or +3 bonus. Cloak +1 Base Cost: 12,000gp (permanent (1/hour) 1st level effect), Cloak +2 Base Cost: 24,000 (permanent (1/hour) Shimmer 2nd level effect), Cloak +3 Base Cost: 48,000gp (permanent (1/hour) 4th level effect. Apparent Value: 170gp.

###### Cloak of Skinchanging

By raising the hood and wrapping himself in the folds of one of these animal-skin cloaks, the wearer can change into the form of a specific animal (determined by the type of cloak). While transformed, the wearer gains all of the physical characteristics, movement types, attack routines, and special abilities of his new form while retaining his own mental abilities. Once transformed, the wearer can remain in animal form indefinitely, but may return to his own form at any time. If slain while transformed, the wearer reverts to his original form. Once the wearer returns to his own form, the cloak’s powers may not be used again for one hour (six turns). Such cloakstraditionally come in one of six types, shown below. The Judge can choose or roll randomly for the type of cloak found, or make cloaks for other types of animals appropriate to his setting. Base Cost: 38,000gp (permanent (turn/level) 2nd level effect). Apparent Value: 1,200gp.

###### Cloak of the Elven Ranger

The means of its creation once a carefully guarded secret of the elves, this lightweight cloak seems to shift its hues between soft greens, browns and grays whenever its wearer moves. The wearer of the cloak blends almost effortlessly into his surroundings, and can hide in cover or darkness as a combat action with a Hiding proficiency throw of 12+. If he is already proficient in Hiding, he instead gains a +8 bonus to his Hiding proficiency throws, as the spell *chameleon*. Base Cost: 19,000gp (Permanent (turn/level) *Chameleon* 1st level effect). Apparent Value: 3,780gp.

###### Collapsible Boat

This lattice-patterned oak and walnut box is 12” x 6” x 6”, with a hinged lid covering one side. Opening the box reveals a number of intricately fitted copper levers and disks; manipulating these will cause the box to open further, wood shifting and unfolding over the course of a turn until a seaworthy vessel is formed. The box can become any standard vessel up to a value of 60,000gp (for the vessel list see **Equipment Descriptions** in ***ACKS II Rules Revision***, Chapter 4), from a canoe to a huge sailing ship. It will include oars, sails, and other mariner equipment needed for its operation, but no war machines or provisions. The ship will persist until its controls (moved to a place near its center) are manipulated to fold it back up, returning to its box shape in the space of a round and jettisoning anything or anyone left aboard. The ship cannot be dispelled but can be damaged as normal. Destruction of the vessel will also destroy the box; any lesser damage or loss of its equipment will show as damage to the box but can be repaired as normal while it is in ship form. The box can only be configured to a new type of vessel if its most recent ship shape is whole and undamaged. Base Cost: 150,000gp (Permanent (1/turn) 6th level esoteric effect). Apparent Value: 400gp.

###### Collar of Conversation

When this bejeweled leather collar is fastened around the throat of an animal, it grants the animal wearing it the ability to comprehend and converse in the language of any intelligent creature within 90’. For purposes of speech, an animal wearing the collar has an effective human-equivalent INT ability score equal to 6 +/- Trainability Modifier. For instance, a white ape (TM +3) wearing the collar has an effective INT 9, while a crocodile (TM -1) wearing it has an effective INT 5. If the collaris fastened around the throat of a sapient creature, it has no magical effect, but may inspire interesting conversations all the same. Base Cost: 100,000gp (permanent (1/turn) *Tongues* 4th level esoteric effect). Apparent Value: 1,000gp.

###### Crucible of Commanding Conjuring Fire Elementals

This orichalcum crucible’s base is set with electrum cut in the shape of flames. Once per day when the crucible is lit with coals, the user may speak an invocation to conjure a **12 HD elemental** from the Elemental Sphere of Fire (see the ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual*** for details), as the spell *conjure major elemental*. The elemental will obey its master’s will so long as he maintains concentration, for up to 13 turns. He can dismiss the elemental at will to return it to its native sphere, but will lose control if his concentration is lost or the elemental moves more than 360’ away from him. An uncontrolled elemental will attack him and his allies before returning to its native sphere; it may not be banished by further use of the crucible, only by spells such as *counterspell, dispel magic*, or *dispel evil*. Base Cost: 20,000gp (1/day *Conjure Major Elemental* 4th level effect). Apparent Value: 400gp.

###### Crystal Ball

This polished globe is the size of a man’s head, carefully cut from true crystal. It may be used thrice per day to *scry*, as the spell. The user must look into the ball while focusing on the image of a specific creature, object or place of his choice; for up to a turn he will see the target’s image regardless of distance for as long as he concentrates. Images seen this way will be clearer the more familiar and specific the target is. As with other scrying methods, use of a **crystal ball** has a chance of being detected by any creature capable of casting*scry*should he, an object he is carrying or wearing, or his present location be targeted. Base Cost: 24,000gp (3/day *Scry* 4th level esoteric effect). Apparent Value: 600gp.

###### Crystal Ball

The user must look into the ball while focusing on the image of a specific creature, object or place of his choice; for up to a turn he will see the target’s image regardless of distance for as long as he concentrates.

As with other scrying methods, use of a **crystal ball** has a chance of being detected by any creature capable of casting*scry*should he, an object he is carrying or wearing, or his present location be targeted. Base Cost: 24,000gp (3/day *Scry* 4th level esoteric effect). Apparent Value: 600gp.

###### Crystal Ball, Clairaudient

These **crystal balls** allow the user to hear from the location scried upon, as the spell*clairaudiency*. The user will hear through the ears of the creature closest to his apparent point of view. If a living creature is not within 90’ of the apparent point of view the *clairaudiency* will fail, though the ball will still show images of the scried target. Base Cost: 42,000gp (3/day *Scry* 4th level esoteric effect 24,000gp, 3/day *Clairaudiency* 3rd level effect 18,000gp). Apparent Value: 600gp.

###### Crystal Ball, Telepathic

These **crystal balls** allow the user mind-to-mind communication while scrying, as the spell *telepathy*. Each round while scrying the user may choose a sapient creature within 180’ of his apparent point of view to request a telepathic link. The target receives a Spells saving throw to resist the link if it is unwilling. Once linked, the caster can read all of the target’s surface thoughts and can send thoughts of his own to the target, without need for a shared language. If no sapient creatures are in range *telepathy* is impossible, though the ball will still show images of the scried target. Base Cost: 48,000gp (3/day *Scry* 4th level esoteric effect 24,000gp, 3/day *Telepathy* 4th level esoteric effect 24,000gp). Apparent Value: 600gp.

###### Cube of Cold Immunity

This pale marble cube appears to be a gambler’s die with a sleeping bear etched into one face. Pressing the bear wards away cold and frost from a cubic area 10’ per side, centered on the cube and moving with it. Those within the area are **immune** to cold as though benefiting from the spell *energy invulnerability*; they automatically succeed on saving throws versus spells or special abilities which deal cold damage, and ignore mundane and extraordinary cold damage. The cube’s effect lasts for 3 turns and may be activated once per hour. Base Cost: 40,000gp (1/hour 5th level effect). Apparent Value: 50gp.

###### Dead Man’s Hand

This grotesque creation is composed of the dried and pickled hand of a lawfully-executed murderer, upon which is mounted a candle formed from the fat of the same murderer. For any of the powers of the hand to be used, its candle must be lit. The candle’s flame gives off no apparent radiance and never seems to burn down, but like any flame can be extinguished by strong wind or water. While the candle is lit it gives an eerie light to its bearer only, letting him see in total darkness to a range of 60’ as the spell *lightless vision*. It also grants him two abilities each usable once each turn. First, by speaking the dead murderer’s true name, the bearer of the hand can *halt humanoids*for 3 rounds as the spell. Second, by speaking the name of the murderer’s last victim, the bearer can suppress *magic lock* and *seal portal* spells within 5’ for 3 turns, as a *chime of unlocking*. The hand can be used by any character but is most sought after by thieves, assassins, and nightblades. Base Cost: 88,500gp (Permanent (1/day) *Lightless Vision* 3rd level effect 22,500gp, 1/turn *Halt Humanoids* 2nd level effect 33,000gp, 1/turn 2nd level effect 33,000gp). Apparent Value: 5sp.

###### Drum of Terror

This large drum is made out of giant rattlesnake hide stretched over a 3’ wide oak frame and set with golden pins, weighing 1 stone. When the drum is struck it produces a bone-rattling beat in all living things within a 240’ radius, excepting the user and those within 10’ of him. Each creature within range must succeed on a Paralysis saving throw or be **frightened**, as the spell *cause fear*. The terror persists for as long as the user remains stationary and concentrates on beating the drum, causing those afflicted to flee if able or to cower if backed into a corner. If interrupted the drumbeat can be freely started again on a subsequent round; all those previously affected or newly exposed to the unnatural rhythm must then make a new Paralysis saving throw to resist the effect, but any who succeeded on a saving throw against it are immune to the effect for one turn afterwards. Base Cost: 150,000gp (Permanent (concentration) 6th level effect). Apparent Value: 750gp.

###### Dust of Revelation

This glittering golden powder is incredibly fine, typically secured in small packets of paper or fabric or in tubes of lightweight wood or bone. A container of dust hurled into the air will coat everything in a 10’ radius of the creature scattering the dust. The dust causes hidden creatures and objects to become instantly visible from the shimmering covering. Creatures coated cannot benefit from Hiding,Natural Stealth,*invisibility*, or the spell*illusory duplicates* until the dust’s magic fades in 1 turn or is dispelled; the dust is too fine to be removed by hand. The dust is typically found 3d10 containers at a time. Base Cost: 1,000gp (single charge 2nd level effect). Apparent Value: 0gp.

###### Dust of Vanishing

This fine charcoal-black powder seems to drink in light. It is typically secured in small packets of paper or fabric or in tubes of lightweight wood or bone. The dust can be applied to a creature or object to render the subject *invisible*. A creature coated will remain *invisible* even if it attacks, though if it casts a spell any dust on it will be rendered inert. The *invisibility* granted by the dust lasts for only 2d6 turns. The dust is typically found 3d10 containers at a time. Base Cost: 1,500gp (single charge 3rd level effect). Apparent Value: 0gp.

###### Elven Rope

These sturdy 50’ long magical ropes are finely braided, with great resistance to wear and damp. Upon command of a person touching it, the rope either ties itself at a point of the speaker’s choice with a spoken type of knot, or unties itself, doing so once per turn. Dwarves stridently insist that they were the original creators of these enchanted cords, calling them **dwarven cord**; when near the Meniri or Jutting Mountains it is best to just humor this claim. Base Cost: 3,300gp. 1/turn cantrip effect. Apparent Value: 90gp.

###### Emblem of the Eagle

This legendary insignia was first carried by the legion of Audarius Tarkaun when he defeated Baal the Terrible at the gates of Zidium, and for centuries afterward served as the insignia of the Auran Army. It was smuggled out of the capital by the Emperor’s Talons during the tumult of the Second Imperial Civil War, but no record of its final whereabouts exists. The emblem consists of a gold eagle mounted atop a 12’ tall pole. To use the emblem, a character must affix the flag of an organized military unit, division, or army to the emblem’s pole and bear it into battle. When borne into combat, the emblem deflects mundane missile and melee attacks targeted at its bearer or his allies within 30’, acting in all ways as the spell *banner of invincibility* except with thrice the spell’s radius and unable to be dispelled. Its increased radius prevents any deflected attack with an area of effect from having its center point of impact land nearer than 30’ from the emblem when it scatters.

If the emblem is carried as the flag of a company-sized or smaller unit on the battlefield, then the entire unit cannot be damaged by missile or melee attacks from units that cannot deal extraordinary damage, and is never considered threatened by enemy units that are unable to damage it. The effect ends if the unit ever recoils, flees, or routs. If the emblem is carried as the flag of an army leader’s unit, then so long as the unit carrying the emblem is fighting on the battlefield with its army, every unit in the army automatically stands firm on its first morale roll, or rallies if it would have stood firm. However, this benefit is lost for the duration of the battle if the unit carrying the emblem is destroyed, routed, or leaves the battle. Base Cost: 919,000gp (6 permanent (1/turn) *Banner of Invincibility* 6th level effects 150,000gp each, permanent (1/3 turns) 1st level effect 19,000gp). Apparent Value: 20,000gp.

###### Faerie Seed

These glistening almond-sized seeds are usually found in an soft leather bag. Planting a seed into the ground enchants all plants within a 240’ radius, as the spell *forest enchantment*. The enchanted plants shift so the planter and his allies can move among them freely, granting a +1 bonus to surprise rolls and faster movement as the spell. Meanwhile, the planter’s enemies will find those plants moving to hinder and vex them, suffering a -1 penalty to surprise rolls and slowing their movement as the spell. After each full season all normal plants in the area receive a collective saving throw to break the seed’s effect as if they were a 1 HD monster, unless the planter ends the effect early by severely damaging the plants or the effect is **dispelled**. Sapient or semi-sapient plant creatures in the area of effect must instead make a Spells save or become **bewitched**,as the spell *beguile humanoid*. 2d4 seeds are typically found in a bag at a time, remaining free of disease, rot, or spoilage indefinitely. Base Cost: 2,500gp (single charge *Forest Enchantment* 5th level effect). Apparent Value: 0gp.

###### Gauntlets of Ogre Strength

These thick gauntlets envelope each hand in a firm embrace of iron and leather. The wearer’s hands gain a staunch grip of their own, letting him strike, lift and carry as if he was an ogre of comparable build. He gains an additional +2 bonus to all melee attack throws and damage rolls and an additional +8 bonus on Dungeonbashing throws. He also gains the ability to strike barehanded for 1d4 bludgeoning damage and to carry an extra 10 stone at his maximum load. Base Cost: 38,000gp (Permanent (1/3 turn) *Ogre Strength* 2nd level effect). Apparent Value: 20gp.

###### Gem of Conjuring Earth Elementals

This round-cut emerald is a striking shade of green, with a darkened center containing miles of apparent depth. Once per day when the gem is surrounded with soil and squeezed, the user may speak an invocation to conjure a 12 HD elemental from the Elemental Sphere of Earth (see the ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual*** for details), as the spell *conjure major elemental*. The elemental will obey its master’s will so long as he maintains concentration, for up to 13 turns. He can dismiss the elemental at will to return it to its native sphere, but will lose control if his concentration is lost or the elemental moves more than 360’ away from him. An uncontrolled elemental will attack him and his allies before returning to its native sphere; it may not be banished by further use of the gem, only by spells such as *counterspell, dispel magic*, or *dispel evil*. Base Cost: 20,000gp (1/day *Conjure Major Elemental* 4th level effect). Apparent Value: 2,000gp.

###### Gem of Force

This brilliantly clear cubic diamond is a half-inch across with narrowly beveled edges. By touching a finger to each face of the diamond its owner will create a *wall of force* centered upon the gem, in the shape of a cube 10’ on each side with 1’ thick walls. Creatures and objects in the way of the cube of force are pushed gently to the nearest safe side of its walls; if activated while the user is surrounded by solid objects such as dungeon walls, the diamond glows momentarily but otherwise fails to function. The cube of force is impenetrable to all spells and objects and cannot be dispelled, only falling to a disintegrate spell or ritual magic. If activated while the user is flying, the cube of force will remain fixed in the air rather than fall. The cube of force remains for two turns once activated; its owner cannot end the effect early, and cannot activate the gem again until four further turns have passed. Base Cost: 48,000gp (1/hour *Wall of Force* 6th level effect). Apparent Value: 4,000gp.

###### Genie Bottle

Confined within this warm copper flask is an **efreet**, a mighty genie of elemental fire (see the ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual*** for details). The efreet is bound to serve whomever releases it by breaking the flask’s wax seal until a full month has passed, it is slain or **dispelled**, or it grants its master three *wishes*. The genie must obey its master’s verbal commands to the letter, but it will resentfully subvert its orders whenever possible, twisting meanings to bring its master harm. Compelling the efreet to grant *wishes* is a particularly perilous undertaking; with the genie directing immense realty-altering power, the slightest ambiguity will allow it to inflict ruinous troubles upon its master. Base Cost: 200,000gp (Single charge 9th level esoteric ritual effect). Apparent Value: 600gp

###### Hammer of the Master Smith

This iron dwarven smith’s hammer is covered with scratches and dents on all but the maker’s mark on the side of its head, and is imbued with long years of expertise. A wielder starting a project on which the hammer would be useful (producing a single weapon, set of armor, piece of jewelry, etc.) will work with enhanced ability, gaining a rank in the relevant Craft proficiency for the duration of the project, as the spell *crafting*. The increased skill lasts until the project is complete or a day has passed without the user working on the project for a full 8 hours. A project interrupted for more than a day cannot gain the benefits of the hammer again for that project. After beginning a project with the hammer, the user must wait one week before he can turn the hammer’s power to a new project, regardless of how long the first project takes to finish. Base Cost: 12,000gp (1/week *Crafting* 4th level effect). Apparent Value: 2gp.

###### Helm of Awe

This orichalcum helmet has an open face with long cheek guards and a tall red crest. The wearer of the **helm of awe** inspires dread in the hearts of the wicked. Each evil creature that begins its initiative or moves within 30’ of the wearer must make a Spells saving throw. If the save succeeds, the creature can act normally. If the save fails, the creature **falters** that round. A **faltering** creature suffers a -2 penalty to attack throws, proficiency throws, and saving throws against the wearer. For purposes of the helm’s power, evil creatures include hostile creatures of an alignment other than the wearer’s own, and inherently evil creatures such as undead and summoned creatures of Chaotic alignment. Base Cost: 76,000gp (permanent (1/3 turns) *Inspire Awe* 4th level effect). Apparent Value: 3,000gp.

###### Helm of Comprehension

This bronze helmet is embossed with a crisscross of golden lines, formed of characters from dozens of scripts overlaid on each other. The wearer can understand the general meaning of any written script he reads, even those inscribed in lost languages or encoded with ciphers or secret symbols, as the spell *discern gist*. Base Cost: 25,000gp (Permanent (1/turn) *Discern Gist* 1st level effect). Apparent Value: 150gp.

###### Helm of Disalignment

This elegant and lightweight open-faced helmet is lined with a soft velvet interior. The helm bears an unusual curse: a person putting on the helmet instantly has his alignment changed for as long as he wears it, with no saving throw permitted. A Lawful person becomes Chaotic and vice versa; one of neutral alignment has even chances of becoming Lawful or Chaotic. The effects of the helmet cannot be ended by a *remove curse* or *dispel magic* spell, only by the removal or destruction of the helmet; upon being separated from the helmet the wearer reverts to his original alignment. The helm’s *enslavement* of its wearer can be discovered by the spell *discern bewitchment*. Whoever wears the helmet will immediately know what it is, what it has done to him, and what would happen if it were to be taken off; however, he will not desire to remove it, viewing the result as a violation of his true self. The helmet will never accidentally slip off its wearer’s brow, requiring a successful Disarm or Sunder maneuver or a helpless wearer for it to be physically removed. Base Cost: 22,500gp (Permanent (1/day) 3rd level effect). Apparent Value: 660gp.

###### Helm of Telepathy

This ancient closed-face helmet is glossy black with fine platinum filigree, the lines of bright metal over the eyes and joints creating the impression of a scarab beetle resting over the wearer’s face. The helm grants the wearer the ability to communicate mentally at will, as the spell *telepathy*. With stationary concentration the wearer can establish a telepathic link with a sapient creature within 180’; the target is allowed a Spells saving throw to resist. If linked, the wearer can read all of the target’s surface thoughts and send thoughts of his own; deeper secrets or memories may require interrogation or other prompting to bring the thoughts to the present mind of the target. Base Cost: 100,000gp (Permanent (1/turn) *Telepathy* 4th level esoteric effect). Apparent Value: 2,500gp.

###### Helm of Teleportation

This silvered helmet shines with strange reflections showing an ever-changing medley of blurred locations. The helm allows its wearer to instantly send himself or a touched creature to his destination of choice once per turn, as the spell *teleportation*. An unwilling creature is allowed a Spells saving throw to resist the effect. Teleporting via the helm is just as inaccurate and dangerous for the teleported creature as with the spell, though the wearer may consider this a bonus when using it against a hostile target. Base Cost: 82,500gp (1/turn *Teleportation* 5th level effect). Apparent Value: 1,000gp.

###### Horn of the Eagles

When this rune-carved ivory hunting horn is steadily blown for a full turn, its high clear note calls 2d4 giant eagles (see the ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual*** for details) to the aid of the horn-blower. The eagles will fly from the nearest 24-mile wilderness hex of mountains terrain, requiring 1d6 hours if called from within such a hex, or an additional hour per additional 24-mile hex between that hex and the wielder’s location. If the wielder is unreachable upon the eagles’ arrival (such as deep in a dungeon), they will circle the sky nearby. The eagles will understand the horn-blower’s speech and will serve as his loyal friends and companions, acting as if they were the horn-blower’s henchmen. The eagles remain for one day before departing unless slain or **dispelled**. The horn can be blown once per day; if blown again when the eagles are about to depart, they will instead remain for another day. If the horn is ever blown by someone with malicious intentions for the eagles (such as to capture or kill them), it will instead emit only a wheezing gasp and no eagles will arrive. Base Cost: 25,000 (1/day 5th level effect). Apparent Value: 200gp.

###### Holy Talisman of the Winged Sun

This mythical relic was said to have been carried down from Mt. Audarammas by Azendor, prophet of Ammonar, when the Laws of Light first returned to mankind. It was lost to history when Baal the Terrible sacked Aura, and remains much sought by the Temple of the Winged Sun. Any character of Lawful alignment who bears the talismangains a +4 bonus to his Death, Implements, Paralysis, and Spells saving throws, as the spell *strength of mind*. If the bearer is also a divine spellcaster, he can use the talisman to cast *dispel evil*once per turn and to cast *restore life and limb*once per week. Base Cost: 174,000gp (1/turn *Dispel Evil* 6th level effect 99,000gp, permanent (1/hour) *Strength of Mind* 5th level effect 60,000gp, 1/week *Restore Life and Limb* 5th level effect 15,000gp). Apparent Value: 10,000gp.

###### Implement of the Night Sky

This strange 1’ wide disc of matte black metal is covered with an array of sparkling dials and switches. Just as the stars move across the heavens, the implement’s powers change with every month of the year. Each month the implement offers its user a different set of three powers, each of which can be used once per day with a spoken command. In order for the implement to function, its dials and switches must be rotated to correctly match the configuration of the constellation currently within the zodiac, which requires one turn and a successful Knowledge (astrology) proficiency throw. (If the Judge wishes to substitute zodiac signs of his own design in lieu of those listed below, each zodiac sign should have three powers, totaling 12 levels of spells. E.g. one 6th, one 4th, and one 2nd level power, or two 5th and one 2nd, etc.) Base Cost: 60,000gp (1/day combined 12 levels of effect). Apparent Value: 1,100gp.

###### Inexhaustible Flask

This platinum flask is set with tiny blue diamonds forming a depiction of a bursting spring. The flask is full of an endless amount of clean water; when it is opened and held perfectly upside down the water flows out at five gallons per round. This water exists permanently and cannot be dispelled, similar to the spell *create water*. Up to once per turn the flask can be commanded to expel a spout of water 60’ long and 5’ wide. Those struck by the blast suffer 2d6 extraordinary bludgeoning damage and are knocked **prone**; a successful Blast saving throw prevents the knockdown and halves the damage taken. Base Cost: 141,500gp (Permanent (1/turn) 5th level esoteric effect 125,000gp, 1/turn 1st level effect 16,500gp). Apparent Value: 5,000gp.

###### Iron-bound Book of Xisuthros

Written by the Chthonic priest Xisuthros a thousand years before the Auran Empire dawned, this heavy tome contains innumerable incantations and workings of complex spellcraft, with a focus on black magic and diabolism. The book was Xisuthros’s life’s work, with its final pages cut from his own flesh and inked with his own blood. His masterpiece consumed not merely his body but also his mind, a vestige of his soul bound within to serve as a conduit for the book’s magic. The book may be read to gain access to otherworldly knowledge from entities of Chthonic Darkness, answering up to 4 questions with each turn of use as the spell *contact other sphere*. As with the spell, the user must make a Death saving throw after each answer; however, in lieu of gaining a Tampering with Mortality side effect on a failure, Xisuthros’s remnant will gain a foothold in the user’s mind. Once the vestige has seized hold, the user must make a saving throw each day versus Spells or fall under its control. The user’s first saving throw against the vestige gains a +20 bonus, but each consecutive saving throw is one point less advantaged. When the user fails, he falls under the Judge’s control for 1d10 hours, during which time the vestige will seek to advance its own depraved chthonic ends and to restore Xisuthros to life. The day after falling under control, the user resumes his saving throws with a +20 bonus. Each additional time the user fails the Death saving throw while using the book, his initial saving throw bonus after falling under control is reduced by 4. The vestige’s malign presence can only be removed with ritual magic that would remove a tampering effect, such as a *wish* or *miracle*. Base Cost: 101,500gp (1/turn 5th level *Contact Other Sphere* esoteric effect 82,500gp, permanent (1/3 turns) 1st level effect 19,000gp). Apparent Value: 2,000gp.

###### Iron Crown of the Sorcerer-Kings

This infamous regalia was created by Uragasi, first sorcerer-king of Zahar, conqueror of the Thrassians. It was worn by every reigning sorcerer-king thereafter until it was lost to history during the fall of Zahar. While the crownis worn, the wearer regenerates 3 hit points each round. If the wearer is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, he immediately rolls 1d20 and 1d6 on the Mortal Wounds table, applying the usual modifier for Hit Points and Constitution, but applying a +11 bonus in lieu of the usual modifiers for Treatment and Timing. After the mortal wound (if any) is determined, the wearer is then immediately restored to 1 hp without any need for bed rest. Any limbs or body parts lost to mortal wounds will attempt to crawl or squirm back to the main portion of the body to reattach, and can be reattached instantly simply by being held to the stump. If severed limbs or parts are forcibly kept from reattaching, the lost limbs and parts, along with all other mortal wounds received while wearing the crown, will be restored when the wearer regenerates to full hit points. The wearer of the crowncan only be actually killed if he is disintegrated, slain by death magic, or slain while helpless by an unengaged combatant. The crown will never accidentally slip from a Chaotic wearer’s brow, but it can be voluntarily removed, and it can be knocked from its wearer’s brow with a successful Disarm special maneuver. Base Cost: 222,000gp (permanent (1/turn) *Trollblood* 6th level effect 150,000gp, permanent (1/hour) *Necromantic Invulnerability* 6th level effect 72,000gp). Apparent Value: 6,500gp.

###### Iron Mask of Cyfaraun

At the height of their corruption in Southern Argollë, the elves of ancient Cyfaraun forged five grand masks on an altar of profane darkness for the leaders of the ascendant Chthonic cults. With the overthrow of the Argollëan Empire by its Thrassian slaves, the fate of the masks is unknown. Each of these intimidating headpieces consists of a fully-enclosing iron faceplate and skullcap helm forged in the likeness of a gargoyle, skull, demon, serpent, or snarling wolf. The mask is a heavy and unwieldy 2 stone of encumbrance when carried or held; once donned it fuses tightly to the wearer’s face and assumes a feather-weight lightness, removable only by the proper command word or by severing his neck. The mask shrouds its wearer in a powerful dweomer that renders him **immune** to all enchantment spells and effects. A person encased inside the mask maintains his normal senses and can see out to 60’ in total darkness, as the spell *lightless vision*. He may breathe unhindered, the mask filtering out any harmful vapors and gases or deleterious effects that rely on smell, such as a *cloud of poison* spell, a fetid gas or poison vapor breath weapon, natural miasma, or the stench of a troglodyte. The mask is imbued with dark Chthonic power, and its wearer can sense a constant thrum of unholy whispering in his mind, imposing a -2 penalty to Hearing throws and a -1 penalty to initiative and surprise rolls. The depraved ancient elven cult-magic emanates palpably from the mask when worn, giving the wearer a -4 penalty to all reaction rolls when dealing with Lawful beings and an immediate hostile reaction from Thrassians, lizardmen, troglodytes, and their ilk. Base Cost: 121,000gp (2 permanent (1/hr) 6th level effects 72,000gp each, permanent (1/day) *Lightless Vision* 3rd level effect 15,000gp, 2 permanent (1/3 turns) 1st level drawbacks -19,000gp each). Apparent Value: 4,000gp.

###### Magic Carpet

This rich carpet is 9’ square, artfully woven from vivid royal purple threads. A person sitting on the carpet and pulling at its tassels as reins will cause it to rise into the air, flying as the spell *magic carpet*. The carpet may hold the driver and up to three passengers for a total of 80 stone of weight; each passenger after the first slows its movement, from an encounter movement of 300’ per turn to 240’ and 180’ respectively. The pilot may not attack or cast spells while commanding the carpet but may do so when the carpet is brought to a hover. Passengers may act more freely, but both pilot and passengers risk being knocked from the carpet if they receive bludgeoning or seismic damage, as usual for the spell. Base Cost: 76,000gp (Permanent (turn/level) *Magic Carpet* 4th level effect). Apparent Value: 3,000gp.

###### Marvelous Dwarven Mechanism

This device is a metal rod 4’ long and 1.5” thick, one side ending in a hollow tube: a conglomeration of overlapping and interwoven plates, buttons, dials and knobs of gold, silver, steel, and bronze, somehow through marvelous craftsmanship appearing as a congruous whole. Though silent when not in use, tiny vibrations can be felt while holding it, as if mechanisms within are constantly rotating and ratcheting into place. Originally crafted by the dwarven smith Barin Bronzegear for the Highborn dwarf Nared Uoret to personally inspect his mines, the mechanism has since passed through the hands of a number of adventurers and explorers who found it equally useful for their own purposes. By careful working of its buttons, knobs, and dials, the implement can produce any of the following effects, though only one at a time:

* Be reconfigured into either a shovel, pick, saw, prybar, or sledgehammer, the tool head emerging from the solid end of the rod and the balance changing to suit.
* Produce a small flame from the tube end, emitting illumination and heat as a torch for 1 hour.
* Emit a great blast of air from the tube end, as the spell *gale of wind*.
* Chime when pointed at metal within 90’, as a wand of *locate metals* usable for 3 turns at a time.
* Release a spray of lubricating oil from the tube end, as the spell *slickness*.
* Be gently extended up to 10’ and locked into place, supporting up to 200 stone of weight when locked or firmly holding shut a door, gate, or window for 2d6 turns, as the spell *seal portal*.
* Unwind the entire center of the rod into 50’ of fine metal chain, functioning in most respects as sturdy rope. With the rod so configured, an identical set of buttons on each remaining end can direct it to move on its own power for up to 4 turns.
* Levitate itself and anything attached to it vertically 20’ per round for up to one turn, an increasingly urgent buzzing being felt in the rod toward the end of the duration.
* The rod can be changed between the various tool or chain configurations at will. After using either the flame, wind, metal detection, oil, extension lock, or chain animation ability, the user must wait one hour before using any of those abilities again. The levitation functions only once per day but is not constrained by use of the other abilities. Base Cost: 53,000gp (permanent (1/3 turns) 1st level effect (tools and chain) 19,000gp, 1/day 1st level effect (levitation) 5,000gp, 1/hour (choice of 2nd level effect (locate metals), *Gale of Wind* 2nd level effect, *Illumination* 1st level esoteric effect, *Seal Portal* 1st level esoteric effect, *Slickness* 1st level effect, 1st level effect (rope), total 3.625th level esoteric effect) 29,000gp.) Apparent Value: 1,500gp.

###### Mask of the Basilisk

This infamous mask of petrified wood is carved with a hideous reptilian visage, and held fast to its wearer’s head by an attached hood of basilisk hide. Any creature, friend or foe, who meets the wearer’s gaze must make a Paralysis saving throw. If the save succeeds the creature is unaffected, but if the save fails it is instantaneously **petrified**. Neither **dispelling** nor a *remove curse* spell can reverse the petrification; only the spell *depetrification* can return a petrified creature to living flesh. Creatures surprised by the wearer automatically meet his gaze, as do those attacking him without averting their eyes or using a mirror. An attacker that averts its eyes does not meet his gaze, but suffers a -4 penalty on attack throws and -2 penalty on AC. Anyone using a mirror to fight the wearer suffers a penalty of only -2 to attack throws and no penalty to AC. Base Cost: 150,000gp (permanent (1/turn) 6th level effect). Apparent Value: 350gp.

###### Mirror of Nemesis

This cursed mirror is made from a flat sheet of highly-polished bronze, typically kept covered by a scarlet cloth. The first living creature within 45’ of the mirror that makes eye contact with its reflection will see it appearing as a horrific double which seems to leap through the mirror’s surface and attack it. The reflection is visible only to the creature, immune to all attacks, and attacks each round with a 4 HD monster’s attack throw, as the spell *phantasmal horror*. The creature can make a Spells saving throw to disbelieve it at the start of its initiative, but if the creature fails, the reflection continues attacking until it slays its target by landing a single successful blow, is **dispelled**, or has been evaded for nine rounds. The mirror is subsequently left nonmagical. The Judge should roll d6 for the style of mirror (1-2, circular hand mirror 1’ diameter; 3-4, wall mirror 2’ x 3’; 5-6, standing mirror 3’ x 6’). Base Cost: 2,500gp (single charge *Phantasmal Horror* 5th level effect). Apparent Value: 100gp, but will likely trigger on appraisal.

###### Necklace of Acclimatization

Hanging from this gold-wire necklace is a platinum medallion, engraved with an image of a titan blowing away a cloud with a mighty breath. The necklace cleanses all air breathed by its wearer, protecting him from harmful or noxious vapors. He is **immune** to damage or negative effects caused by breathing in any sort of fumes, such as a *cloud of poison*spell, a fetid gas or poison vapor breath weapon, natural miasma, the rank scent of a troglodyte, and so on. Base Cost: 72,000gp (Permanent (1/hr) 6th level esoteric effect). Apparent Value: 600gp.

###### Panoply of the Imperial Warmistress

This legendary set of items was created for Zeodarë I, the first woman acclaimed Tarkaun, by the Temple of the Winged Sun in gratitude for her re-building the Golden Temple on Mt. Audarammas. The panoplywas lost centuries later during the widespread looting of the Second Imperial Civil War, and its whereabouts remain unknown. The panoply consists of a pair of bracers, a pair of boots, a corselet, and a diadem, described below.

**Bracers of the Imperial Warmistress:**These shining orichalcum bracers will repel mundane missile attacks from the wearer, other than those made with silver weapons, as the spell *deflect ordinary missiles***.** The wearer also gains a +2 bonus to AC and saving throws, as the spell *divine protection*. Both bracers must be worn for the magic to be effective. Base Cost: 106,750gp (permanent (1/3 turns) *Deflect Ordinary Missiles* 3rd level effect 57,000gp, permanent (1/hr) *Divine Protection* 3rd level effect 36,000gp, fractional set powers 13,750gp). Apparent Value: 3,000gp.

**Boots of the Imperial Warmistress:** The wearer of these strappy red leather boots moves with fluid grace and agility. She gains a +2 bonus to AC and initiative, as well as a +2 bonus to attack throws with medium or smaller melee and thrown weapons. She may spring up to 10’ high and to a distance of 30’, gains a +8 bonus on Acrobatics throws, and need not rest if engaged in ordinary movement, as the spell *leaping*. Both boots must be worn for the magic to be effective. Base Cost: 127,250gp (5 permanent (1/3 turns) 1st level effects 19,000gp each, permanent (1/3 turns) *Leaping* 1st level effect 19,000gp, fractional set powers 13,750gp). Apparent Value: 50gp.

**Corselet of the Imperial Warmistress:** This body-hugging corselet is crafted of thick crimson samite and ornamented with a gleaming orichalcum eagle. Its wearer gains a +5 bonus to AC, as though wearing **bracers of armor**. She is also **immune** to mundane cold damage and effects, and **resistant** to extraordinary cold damage and effects, as the spell *energy protection*. The corselet’s bonus to AC does not stack with armor, but does stack with other bonuses or penalties to AC (including from DEX, the use of a shield, class powers, other spells, a **ring of protection**, and so on). Base Cost: 142,750gp (+5 AC bonus 105,000gp, permanent (1/hr) *Energy Protection* 2nd level effect 24,000gp, fractional set powers 13,750gp). Apparent Value: 4,500gp.

**Diadem of the Imperial Warmistress:** This ornamental headband is forged of bright orichalcum and set with a ruby sun. Its wearer is granted a bold, commanding presence. She gains a +1 bonus to domain morale, to henchmen loyalty, to henchmen and troop morale while she leads them, and to reaction rolls to impress and intimidate. If she obtains a reaction roll of 12 or more, the subjects act as if **bewitched** while in her presence, as the Mystic Aura proficiency. The wearer is able to hire one more henchman than normally permitted. She is **immune** to normal and magical fear effects, and can apply her CHA modifier instead of her STR modifier to her damage rolls when attacking with tiny, small, or medium weapons. Base Cost: 113,750gp (4 permanent (1/3 turns) 1st level effects 19,000gp each, permanent (1/hr) *Allure* 1st level effect 12,000gp, permanent (1/hr) 1st level effect 12,000gp, fractional set powers 13,750gp). Apparent Value: 7,000gp.

A bladedancer, female warrior with 16 or higher CHA, or similar heir to Zeodarë I’s legacy who is equipped with at least two of the four components of the panoplygains the ability to cast *swift sword*once per day. If equipped with at least three of the four components, she also gains the ability to cast *striking*once per day. If equipped with the entire panoply, she additionally gains the ability to cast *winged flight*once per day.

Designer’s Note: The set power cost was calculated by dividing the base cost of each of the three daily effects by the corresponding number of items in the set required to access that power, then applying that cost to all items in the set.

###### Rope of Ascent

This 50’ length of rope is tightly spun, only a finger-width thick. Despite its size, it can support up to 100 stone of weight. A person holding one end of the rope may command it to move 10’ per round in any direction, with the rope able to tie and untie itself, wrap around things, or navigate around obvious hazards as commanded. The rope will ignore the orders of anyone who grabs it while it is already commanded. Base Cost: 19,000gp (Permanent (turn/level)1st level effect). Apparent Value: 100gp.

###### Scarab of Life

Hanging from a silver wire chain, this green agate amulet has its top carved as a scarab beetle, while its flat-faced bottom is minutely engraved with a short prayer for the safety of the wearer. The scarab protects its wearer from all **curse** and **death** spells and effects, including the enervation of certain demons and undead, as the spell *death ward*. It is a charged item and will eventually run out; each spell or effect blocked expends a charge from the scarab, which is found with 2d6 charges remaining. The agate crumbles into dust when its last charge is spent. Base Cost: 24,000gp (12 charges *Death Ward* 4th level effect). Apparent Value: 300gp.

This aurochs horn is encircled by ruddy gold bands depicting a succession of erupting volcanoes. Blowing the horn produces a blast of sound, forming a cone 100’ long and 20’ wide at its far end. Each creature caught in the blast suffers 3d6 extraordinary seismic damage and is deafened for 2d6 rounds; a successful Blast saving throw prevents the deafness and half the damage. Structures caught in a blast will suffer similar damage; a small wooden structure may be destroyed in one blast or a thick stone wall in several. The horn can be blown once per turn. Base Cost: 66,000gp (1/turn 4th level effect). Apparent Value: 700gp.

###### Thurible of Conjuring Air Elementals

This lightweight silver incense burner sways in the slightest of breezes as if the wind wishes to claim it. Once per day when the thurible is lit with sweet incense, the user may speak an invocation to conjure a **12 HD elemental** from the Elemental Sphere of Air (see the ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual*** for details), as the spell *conjure major elemental*. The elemental will obey its master’s will so long as he maintains concentration, for up to 13 turns. He can dismiss the elemental at will to return it to its native sphere, but will lose control if his concentration is lost or the elemental moves more than 360’ away from him. An uncontrolled elemental will attack him and his allies before returning to its native sphere; it may not be banished by further use of the thurible, only by spells such as *counterspell, dispel magic*, or *dispel evil*. Base Cost: 20,000gp (1/day *Conjure Major Elemental* 4th level effect). Apparent Value: 350gp.

###### Visor of the Eagle

This bronze face mask with the countenance of a fierce screaming eagle is meant for attachment to an open-faced helm as a visor. The wearer’s eyes look large and piercing from within, and are able to see with the clarity of a great bird of prey, eight times as far as he normally could. His enhanced sight reduces his penalty with missile attack throws to -1 at medium range and -2 at long range. Base Cost: 24,000gp (Permanent (1/hour) 2nd level effect). Apparent Value: 200gp.

###### Visor of the Vampire

This infamous silvered face mask with sinister frowning visage is meant for attaching to a helmet as an armored visor. Said to be wrought from the remains of ten-score vampires, with their coffins fueling its forge, it was worn by the Zaharan warlord Moruvai the Elder in his campaigns of utter subjugation. The wearer’s eyes appear like pools of endless promise; he can use a combat action to hypnotize a creature within 60’ which is beholding him, which must succeed on a Spells saving throw with a penalty of -2 or be **enslaved**. The **enslavement** lasts until **dispelled**, the wearer releases the creature, the wearer removes the mask, or the wearer is slain. Any creature that attacks or is attacked by the wearer in melee is assumed to meet his gaze unless it specifically averts its eyes. Combatants who avert their eyes suffer penalties of -4 on attack throws and -2 to AC. Up to 11 creatures can be **enslaved** at any given time. Base Cost: 150,000gp (Permanent (1/turn) 6th level effect). Apparent Value: 1,500gp.

Witch’s Broom

This broom can be distinguished from a mundane broom by its binding: golden hair from the head of a young maiden. When mounted and commanded the broom will rise into the air, able to fly at an encounter movement rate of 240’ per turn with a single rider weighing up to 20 stone. Should a second rider or equivalent weight be added, the broom will slow to a rate of 180’ per turn. The broom will not fly if more than 40 stone of weight is carried, plummeting to the ground or failing to rise as appropriate. Base Cost: 48,000gp (Permanent (1/hour) 4th level effect). Apparent Value: 2gp.

###### Woodwind of the Woodlands

This reed pipe is carved with pastoral images. If a person plays the woodwind while at least one animal of 1 HD or less is within 15’, the nearest such animal must make a Spells saving throw. If its save succeeds, the animal resists the woodwind’s magic; if it fails it falls under the pipe-player’s sway and thereafter does whatever he commands, the orders magically conveyed to the animal by the music of the pipe. The effect lasts for as long as the user continues to play, though the animal receives another saving throw each turn. Once freed the animal will immediately seek to return to its original location; its disposition towards the pipe-player will depend on how it was treated while ensorcelled. The woodwind cannot be used for one turn after the user stops playing or the animal succeeds on a saving throw. Using the woodwind does not require the Performance proficiency, but the target suffers a -1 penalty to the save per rank of Performance possessed by the pipe-player. Base Cost: 3,300gp (1/turn cantrip effect). Apparent Value: 105gp.

#### Arms and Armor

Magical weapons and armor follow the same class restrictions as all normal weapons and armor. When armor has a bonus, it improves the AC by the amount specified. Magical armor and shields are less cumbersome to move in and use than their nonmagical equivalents, and effectively weigh 1 less stone, to a minimum of 1/6 stone. This encumbrance reduction does not stack with the reduction from masterwork armor, nor does the amount vary with the armor or shield’s enhancement value.

EXAMPLE: A suit of **leather armor +2** grants AC (2+2) = 4 and has an encumbrance of (2-1) 1 st. A **shield +3** grants AC (1+3) = 4 and has an encumbrance of (1 – 1, minimum 1/6 st) 1/6 st.

When a weapon has a bonus, such as a **dagger +1**, this means that attack throws and damage rolls both receive the bonus. If a weapon has more than one bonus listed, the first bonus applies to all attacks and damage, and the second applies only to a more limited selection of creatures. If the weapon’s entry does not specify which group of creatures the secondary bonus applies to, you can choose or roll for the creatures affected on the Weapon vs. Creature table. All magic weapons deal extraordinary damage.

Special items for each category are described below for the categories of swords, miscellaneous weapons, and armors.

###### Types of Arms and Armor

In most cases, the entries for armor, swords, and weapons on the magic item tables do not specify the exact item found. A suit of armor might be hide, ring, or plate; a sword might be a short sword or a two-handed sword; a miscellaneous weapon might be a battle axe, spear, or warhammer. What is found will depend on the source of the treasure. The Judge can use the below tables to guide placement of appropriate armors, swords, and weapons in his treasure hoards based on the campaign setting and treasure source.

The categories used in these tables are described below. You should feel free to modify these tables or create your own that match your particular campaign settings. Many interesting possibilities presented by history have been excluded simply due to the limits of space.

**Ancient Myth:** For campaigns set in an ersatz Mesopotamian and Mediterranean Bronze or Iron Age civilization, such as Sumeria, Babylonia, Scythia, or Mycenae. Armor tends to be laminated cloth (leather), leather scale, Sumerian overlapping bronze plate (banded), or early bronze panoply (plate). Gladiator armors are included to represent partial armor sets of the next higher tier. Common weapons in these ancient days include the composite bow, javelin, mace, short sword, and spear. In the Auran Empire setting, treasures from the Ancient Argollëan, Thrassian, and Zaharan civilizations, and from contemporary Kemesh, would use these entries.

**Classical Epic:** For campaigns inspired by Greco-Roman, Zoroastrian Persian, or Byzantine civilization or sword-and-sandal fiction. Armor might be leather, leather scale, linothorox (laminated linen), Celtic mail or Roman lorica hamata (chain), Roman lorica squamata (scale), Roman lorica segmentata (banded), Byzantine or Persian lamellar, or Greek classical panoply (plate). Gladiator armors are included to represent both actual gladiator apparel and partial armor sets. Common weapons include composite bows; lances such as the kontos and xyston; pole arms such as the falx and sarissa; short swords such as the gladius, kopis, and xiphos; spears such as the doru; and swords such as the spatha. In the Auran Empire setting, these entries would apply to treasures from the Classical Auran civilization and the current Imperial one.

**Northern Saga:** For campaigns similar to the world described in the Old Norse and Icelandic epics and the Anglo-Saxon poem Beowulf, or historical Iron Age Germany or Viking Age Scandinavia. Armor will include furs, hardened leather, Frankish ring armor, leather scale, chainmail byrnies, and limited plate-and-mail. Common weapons include the battle axe, great axe, seax (dagger), spear, sword, and warhammer. In the Auran Empire setting, treasures from the Kingdoms of Jutland and Rorn would use these entries.

**Chivalric Romance:** For campaigns inspired by the 11th to 13th century *chansons de geste*, such as the Matter of France or Matter of Britain and the later chivalric romances of the 13th and 14th centuries. Armor might be cuir bouilli (leather), ring armor, leather scale, Norman mail hauberks, brigandine (lamellar), and plate-and-mail. Common weapons include the couched lance, great sword, horseman’s flail, longbow, knightly sword, mace, morning star, and various pole arms such as the halberd, glaive, and pike. This time period post-dates the Auran Empire setting, but is very common in other fantasy game settings.

**Arabian Adventure:** For campaigns drawing on the late Byzantine and Persian Empires, the medieval Crusades, the Islamic Golden Age, and the folk lore of *One Thousand and One Nights*. Armor might be silk, leather, ring, leather scale, Crusader mail, eastern lamellar, or mirror armor (plate). Common weapons include the composite bow, lance, mace, spear, and various curved swords such as the scimitar, shamshir, and tulwar. In the Auran Empire, these entries could be used for contemporary Opelenean, Somirean, Skysos, and Celdorean treasures.

**High Fantasy:** For campaigns inspired by Tolkienesque heroic fantasy in the pseudo-medieval tradition, including *The Lord of the Rings*, *Dragonlance*, *Game of Thrones*, *The Deed of Paksenarrion*, and most other popular fantasy of the last few decades. The armor and weapons tend to be similar to those used in the High Middle Ages.

**Sword & Sorcery:** For campaigns inspired by Howardian heroic fantasy in the pulp tradition, including *Conan*, *Kull*, *Thongor*, *Kothar*, and other works. The armor and weapons tend to be a hodgepodge of the ancient, classical, medieval, exotic, and purely fantastical.

The apparent value of any magic sword is 650gp plus the base cost of the weapon (657gp for a short sword, 660gp for a sword, etc.) unless detailed otherwise, equivalent to the value of a masterwork weapon. Daggers, short swords, and two-handed swords are all considered swords for purposes of determining magic items present under the Classic Magic Item Tables.

#### Swords

###### Dagger +1, Delver’s

Known for its use by dwarven explorers and relic-hunters, aboveground this thin dark blade acts as a **dagger +1**. When underground (in a cave, crypt, cellar, or so on) its true power is revealed: it functions as a **dagger +2** and grants its wielder heightened vigilance and stealth while held. The wielder receives a +1 bonus to surprise rolls, and imposes a -1 penalty to opponents’ surprise rolls when approaching from outside line of sight or lying in wait in cover, dim light, or darkness. The dagger also can help uncover relics and riches; once per week, if a coin is touched to the blade, its tip jerks to point in the direction of the most valuable treasure within 240’, as the spell *locate treasure* but with a duration of just one round. Anyone who wields the dagger underground attunes to the dark, suffering a -1 penalty to all attack throws while in direct sunlight for one week afterwards. Base Cost: 26,000gp. (Dagger +1/+2 10,000gp, permanent (1/3 turns) 1st level effect 19,000gp, 1/week 1st level effect 3,000gp, 1/week 2nd level effect drawback -6,000gp). Apparent Value: 653gp.

###### Fire-Eater Sword

This **sword +3** was forged in frost, cold-hammered into form from star-iron that fell out of the icy sky onto a frozen plain. Heat sinks into the blade, never to return. Against creatures that employ elemental fire attacks or live in environments of elemental fire (red dragons, efreeti, fire giants, etc.) it functions as a **sword +6**, cleaving through their flesh and bone like an iceberg carving valleys into the earth. Merely concentrating for a round to point the **fire-eater** steady at flames within 15’ will snuff them out as the spell *quench flame*, extinguishing an area up to 5’ in diameter each round. Its wielder is **immune** to mundane fire damage and automatically succeeds on associated saving throws; he is also **resistant** to extraordinary fire damage, reducing damage by half and receiving a +2 bonus on associated saving throws. Base Cost: 144,000gp (Sword +3/+6 95,000gp, Permanent (1/hour) *Energy Protection* 24,000gp, permanent (concentration) 1st level effect 25,000gp). Apparent Value: 2,000gp.

###### Red Sword of the Warlord

Few weapons are so legendary as the **red sword of the warlord**. The beastman warlord Thrax wielded this orichalcum **sword +3** until his death at the Battle of Bythnium, and the Tarkaun Audarius XI Ulkyreus later bore it throughout his 42-year reign of conquest and war. Like many other imperial relics, it was lost to history during the Second Imperial Civil War. Its wielderis a veritable god of war on the battlefield. He may make an extra attack every round, as the spell *swift sword*, and every successful hit he makes deals an extra 1d6 points of extraordinary luminous damage. He is granted a limitless number of cleaves each round, allowing him to singlehandedly carve through entire formations of enemies. The blade of the swordglimmers scarlet if brandished while enemies are within 60’, giving off light like a torch. Base Cost: 237,000gp (Sword +3 35,000gp, permanent (1/3 turns) 4th level effect 76,000gp, permanent (1/3 turns) *Striking* 3rd level effect 57,000gp, permanent (1/3 turns) *Sustained Swift Sword* 3rd level effect 57,000gp, permanent (1/hour) *Illumination* 1st level esoteric effect 12,000gp). Apparent Value: 3,000gp.

###### Sword +1, Bright

This elegant **sword +1** has a blade polished to a mirror finish visible in the slightest glimmer of light. When flourished while speaking its command word the sword will emit light as the spell*illumination*. The*illumination* is deactivated in the same manner and can be activated or deactivated at will. Base Cost: 17,000gp (Sword +1 5,000gp, permanent (1/hour) *Illumination* 1st level esoteric effect 12,000gp). Apparent Value: 660gp.

###### Sword +1, Deathless

This **sword +1** has a backwards-curved meteorite-iron blade set on a bone hilt. The hilt is carved into the shape of a screaming skull and always feels cold to the touch. Such swords were created by the southern Argollëan elves in the final days of their Empire, as a testament to their mastery of necromantic art. Three times per day when the sword is used to slay a living creature, its wielder can, in lieu of cleaving, raise that creature as a *deathless minion* (as the spell). Base Cost: 17,000gp (Sword +1 5,000gp, 3/day *Deathless Minion* 2nd level effect 12,000gp). Apparent Value: 660gp.

###### Sword +1, Flamebrand

The blade of this **sword +1, +2 vs oozes, +3 vs regenerating creatures** glows as if fresh from the forge, softly illuminating a 5’ area with a ruddy light. The sword was imbued with elemental fire to strike down monstrosities unfazed by the bite of steel. All damage dealt with the sword, whether slashing or piercing, is also considered to be extraordinary fire damage, with any appropriate resistances or weaknesses applying. On command the sword’s smoldering glow will flare up brightly, flames rippling over the blade to provide the equivalent of torchlight. Base Cost: 42,000gp (Sword +1/+2 (two types)/+3 22,500gp, permanent (1/day) 1st level esoteric effect 7,500gp, permanent (1/hour) *Illumination* 1st level esoteric effect 12,000gp). Apparent Value: 1,200gp.

###### Sword +1, Locating

This **sword +1** has a silver hound’s head for a pommel. Once per day the sword can be used to sense the direction and approximate distance to a chosen object within 180’, as the spell *locate object*. With the sword held in a loose grip and its command word spoken, it turns to point at the object and emits a gentle hum that increases the closer it draws to the object. The sword will continue to indicate distance and direction to the chosen object for an hour, sensing it through any amount of earth, stone, or wood but unable to perceive through gold or lead. Base Cost: 15,000gp (sword +1 5,000gp, 1/day *Locate Object* 2nd level effect 10,000gp). Apparent Value: 660gp.

###### Sword +2, Beguilement

The pommel of this **sword +2** is made of carved jet depicting a coiled serpent with a woman’s face, set with small golden sapphires for eyes. Thrice per week while stroking the pommel, the bearer may speak the sword’s command word as part of conversation with a living humanoid target within 90’. If the target has fewer than 5HD they will become **bewitched** unless they resist the effect with a successful Spell saving throw, as the spell *beguile humanoid*. Those being threatened or attacked by the wielder or his allies receive a +5 bonus to this throw. Base Cost: 19,000gp (Sword +2 15,000gp, 3/week *Beguile Humanoid* 1st level effect 4,000gp). Apparent Value: 800gp.

###### Sword +2, Command

This sickle-shaped **shortsword +2** has a meteorite-iron blade set on a hilt shaped like a golden crown. Such a sword forged in the early days of Argollë was famously carried as the sidearm of the great elven king Marcan during the Bitter War. Three times per day with the sword in hand and pointed at a target within 15’ the wielder can speak a *word of command* (as the spell), his voice gaining an impressive stentorian resonance while doing so. Base Cost: 21,000gp (Sword +2 15,000gp, 3/day *Word of Command* 1st level effect 6,000gp). Apparent Value: 657gp.

###### Sword +2, Valor

This **sword +2** has a 36” long backwards-curved blade of orichalcum set on an ivory hilt with inlaid silver. Its blade carries an inscription exhorting the wielder to bravery in Ancient Argollëan. Crafted during the Bitter War by the elves of southern Argollë, such swords were among the last magical blades forged by their Empyrean faction before its destruction. Three times per day, the wielder of the sword of valor can **inspire courage** as a bard. When this power is used, the sword sings a choral epic audible over the din of battle for one round. Base Cost: 21,000gp (Sword +2 15,000gp, 3/day 1st level effect 6,000gp). Apparent Value: 660gp.

###### Sword of Fortune

This unblemished blade is a pale shade of silver, made of a metal unknown to men and forged in fire to rival the sun. It functions in combat as a **sword +1** but did not earn its place in history for deeds of combat, nor for the +1 bonus to saving throws granted to its bearer. The sword’s fame comes from its greatest power, wrought into it fivefold times: to alter reality as the ritual spell *wish*. The historical record suggests three times this power was used, each by very different men: a desperate general reversing the course of a battle immediately after his army received a devastating cavalry charge; a patriarch of Türas traversing the world in the span of a single sun with a retinue of templars to destroy an awakening evil; and a tyrant repentant of his sins returning to life the friends he’d betrayed. As these claimed owners of the sword had no shortage of might, money, and magic, the opinions of sages vary as to which of these accomplishments truly expended a *wish*; the sword of fortune is found with 1d4+1 *wishes* remaining of its original five. Base Cost: 1,017,000gp (5 charges *Wish* 9th level esoteric ritual effect 1,000,000gp, sword +1 5,000gp, permanent (1/hour) 1st level effect 12,000gp). Apparent Value: 4,000gp.

###### Sword of Kings

This legendary blade was wielded by Arëtar Pendaelen when he slew the High King of Jutland on the banks of the River Rorn, and it is said that only a man as worthy as Arëtar can tap its powers. In the hands of an ordinary adventurer, it functions as an ordinary **sword +3**. If brandished by a worthy hero (a Lawful fighter with CHA 16 or higher, paladin, or similar martial champion of Law), it gains an additional **+1** bonus, for a total bonus of **+4**. Should the hero also rule a domain or realm, it gains another **+1** bonus, for a total bonus of **+5**. The hero-ruler also gains two additional powers drawn from the sword’s ties to the ancient rites of kingship. First, he deals an extra 2d6 points of extraordinary luminous damage when using the sword to strike a Chaotic creature in his domain or realm. Second, he attains a **oneness of land and lord**, adjusting his hit point total by twice the current morale score of his domain. Provided the wielder remains Lawful and healthy, his domain’s Land Value is increased by 2gp, as if it were benefitting from a *harvest* ritual. However, if the wielder is suffering from a curse or disease then his domain’s Land Value is decreased by 2gp, as if it were suffering from a *ravage* ritual. Base Cost: 181,000gp (Sword +5 105,000gp, permanent (1/3 turns) 3rd level effect 57,000gp, permanent (1/3 turns) 1st level effect 19,000gp). Apparent Value: 6,000gp.

###### Vorpal Sword

This **sword +4** is among the sharpest blades ever forged, with a sharp-faceted ruby set in the pommel of its gilded hilt and a blade that cuts through necks like butter. On any attack throw of an unmodified 20, the sword deals an additional die of extraordinary slashing piercing damage; additionally, the struck creature will be instantly slain by decapitation, unless it succeeds on a Death saving throw. At the Judge’s discretion, certain creatures might survive decapitation, such as slimes, constructs, hydras, and so on. This fabled sword has severed many a neck over the years, most famously the dwarven king Ebreo the Twice-Beheaded. Base Cost: 140,000gp (Sword +4 65,000gp, concentration 3rd level effect 75,000gp).Apparent Value: 5,000gp.

###### Miscellaneous Magic Weapons

The apparent value of any magic weapon is 650gp plus the base cost of the weapon unless detailed otherwise, equivalent to the value of a masterwork weapon. The apparent value of a single magic arrow, bolt or other projectile is likewise at least 32.5gp.

Magic arrows that strike their target are destroyed, but magic arrows that miss their target can be reclaimed after the battle and fired again. Magic polearms and spears only break on a natural 1 if the target is wearing magic armor and/or equipped with a magic shield of equal or greater bonus, or if the target is immune to ordinary piercing damage and has HD greater than 3 x the weapon’s bonus. The weapon’s bonus does not apply once broken.

###### Arrow +3, Death

Each black **arrow +3** of this kind is crafted to strike down one particular type of creature. If an archer speaks the arrow’s activation command (typically ‘seek’, ‘speed well’, or the like) before shooting it against that sort of creature and successfully strikes his target, his target will be instantly slain with no saving throw. An arrow of this kind may be activated only once, its death magic expended in vain should the attack miss or the arrow fly beyond a longbow or composite bow’s maximum range of 360’. The Judge can choose which creature type the arrow’s magic will slay, or roll on the Creature Type table at the beginning of this section. Base Cost: 4,750gp (Arrow +3 1,750gp, Single charge 6th level effect 3,000gp). Apparent Value: 35gp.

###### Bow of the Great Eagles

This legendary elven **composite bow +3** is crafted of laminated dawn redwood with its bow-limbs carved to resemble eagle’s talons. The elvish general Aedon Lann is credited with killing more than 500 orcs with the bowduring the Beastman Wars of the Third Century B.E. With an arrow nocked on the bow’s string, the wielder gains an eagle’s eyesight, letting him see eight times farther than normal and reducing his penalty for missile attacks made with the bow to -1 at medium range and to -2 at long range. He can make shots with pinpoint accuracy, able to fire at targets engaged in melee with a -4 penalty, as the Precise Shooting proficiency. If he already has ranks of Precise Shooting, the bow’s rank of proficiency stacks with his own.

Once per day, the wielder can fire an arrow skyward to call a large roc (see ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual*** for details) to his aid. The roc will fly from the nearest 24-mile wilderness hex of mountains terrain, requiring 1d6 hours if called from within such a hex, or an additional hour per additional 24-mile hex between that hex and the wielder’s location. If the wielder is unreachable upon its arrival (such as deep in a dungeon), the roc will circle the sky close by. The roc will understand the wielder’s speech and will serve as a loyal mount for a Lawful wielder or others that he directs, acting as if it were the wielder’s henchman for one day before departing (unless it is slain or **dispelled**). The roc will only grudgingly serve a Neutral wielder or rider, however, and if asked to perform a Chaotic action or assist a Chaotic creature it will immediately depart. The roc does notarrive with saddle and tack, nor does the bow grant the rider the Riding proficiency, so unproficient characters who ride the roc into battle do so at their own risk. The roc will not answer the wielder’s call if he has malicious intentions for the roc, such as to capture or kill it. Base Cost: 108,000gp (Composite bow +3 35,000gp, 1/day 6th level effect 30,000gp, permanent (1/hour) 2nd level effect 24,000gp, permanent (1/3 turns) 1st level effect 19,000gp). Apparent Value: 1,000gp.

###### Bow of the Unconquered Sun

This **composite bow** **+1**, **+2 versus avian creatures, +3 versus undead** is a relic of the Empyrean War, crafted of laminated dawn redwood and trimmed in golden orichalcum. It grants its wielder an additional attack each round, as the spell *swift sword*. Each arrow shot from the bow ignites with magical flame, dealing both extraordinary fire and extraordinary piercing damage plus an additional 1d6 extraordinary luminous damage. Base Cost: 170,000gp (Composite bow +1/+2 (two types)/+3 22,500gp, permanent (1/3 turns) *Swift Sword Sustained* 3rd level effect 57,000gp, permanent (1/3 turns) *Striking* 3rd level effect 57,000gp, permanent (1/day) 1st level effect 7,500gp). Apparent Value: 2,000gp.

###### Crossbow +1, Dragon’s Breath

Brought to fame by the dwarven mounted crossbowman Orin Eagleeye, this **crossbow +1, +2 vs beastmen** has a bronze tube bound below its fore-end which flares out the front, and a second trigger set ahead of the primary. Pressing the second trigger expends a charge and causes the tube to belch flame in a cone stretching 40’ long and 20’ wide, as the spell *fan of flames*. Each creature the wielder chooses to point his crossbow at within the cone must make a Blast saving throw, suffering 1d8 extraordinary fire damage if it fails, or half that if it succeeds. The crossbow is found with 1d4+1 charges remaining, its second trigger locking backward permanently when the last charge is expended. Base Cost: 12,500. (Crossbow +1/+2 10,000gp, 5 charges *Fan of Flames* 1st level effect 2,500gp). Apparent Value: 680gp.

###### Glaive of the Blade-Goddess

The bladedancer Aurëlyn Tarcalus wielded this renowned **polearm +3** at the Battle of the Fangs, when she held off the orc hordes that threatened to overwhelm the Auran right flank long enough for Malantavius to drive Thrax from the field. Its curved orichalcum blade mounted atop a tall oak pole deals an extra 1d6 extraordinary luminous damage per successful hit. The glaivecan be swung and spun with amazing swiftness, seemingly without any loss of momentum; its wielder gains a +1 bonus to initiative, and she still deals impact damage on a charge or countercharge when making sweep attacks with the glaive. Base Cost: 130,000gp (Polearm +3 35,000gp, permanent (1/3 turns) 3rd level effect 57,000gp, 2 permanent (1/3 turns) 1st level effects 19,000gp each). Apparent Value: 1,500gp.

###### Great Axe of the North

This long-bearded **great axe** **+3, +5 vs dragons and giants** has a rune-carved head and a sturdy yew haft gouged with bite-marks. The hero Sigvhan carried the axe during his expeditions against Dagr, the frost giant king, north of the Jutting Mountains. The sagas recount that Sigvhan died of wounds received felling Dagr and was interred with the axeby his comrades in a great burial mound on the slopes of Mount Skarstind. The axegrants its bearer **immunity** to mundane and extraordinary cold damage, and he automatically succeeds on saving throws against spells or special abilities that deal cold damage, as the spell *energy invulnerability.*

Once per day by gnawing on the haft of the axe for a full round, the wielder may enter a **greater berserkergang**. This grants him a +2 bonus to attack throws and damage rolls, immunity to fear, and decreases mundane damage suffered by 1 point per die. (Damage can be reduced to 0, but not less than 0, on each die). This protection increases to 2 points per die if the wielder is 7th level and 3 points per die if he is 13th level. However, while in this state his tactics become limited (as the Berserkergang proficiency) and he has trouble distinguishing friend from foe; if he rolls a natural 1 on an attack throw, he automatically hits a nearby ally within 5’ in lieu of his preferred target. The greater berserkergang ends only at the conclusion of combat, at which time the wielder becomes **fatigued** and **winded** until he rests for 1 turn. Base Cost: 137,000gp (Great axe +3/+5 (two types) 70,000gp, permanent (1/hour) *Energy Invulnerability* 4th level effect 48,000gp, permanent (1/3 turns) 1st level effect 19,000gp). Apparent Value: 660gp.

###### Javelin +3, Hurling

This **javelin +3** has a weighted pyramidal head of iron set atop a cedar shaft, fastened to a leather throwing strap. Once per turn, if the wielder speaks its command word and hurls the weapon at a wood or stone target larger than a man (such as a door, wall, or vessel) within the javelin’s 120’ thrown range, it will unerringly smash into the target with immense force, as the spell *battering ram*. It will deal 1d4 extraordinary seismic structural damage to a stone target or 1d4x5 to a wooden one (sufficient to knock down an oak door, break off a parapet, etc.) and blast shards of stone or splinters of wood from the target in a 5’ radius. Each creature in the area of effect must make a Blast saving throw. If the save fails, the creature suffers 3d6 mundane piercing damage, or half that if the save succeeds. The weapon returns itself to its wielder’s hand without fail whenever thrown, regardless of whether it hits or misses. Base Cost: 93,000gp (Javelin +3 35,000gp, 1/turn *Battering Ram* 2nd level effect 33,000gp, permanent (1/turn) 1st level effect (returning to hand) 25,000gp). Apparent Value: 651gp.

###### Scourge of Law

This infamous weapon was enchanted in the waning years of Zahar as a tool to detect and destroy practitioners of the heretical Empyrean faith. The rune-carved **flail +3**’s segmented hepatizon composition gives it a dark purplish copper patina.While the scourge is in hand the wielder sees a fiery red aura marking any creature within 45’ with hostile intentions towards him. If the scourge is wrapped around the neck of a helpless creature, the wielder can read the creature’s thoughts by concentrating, as the spell *telepathy*. Each time the scourgeis used to slay a Lawful creature in combat, the weapon’s damage bonus is temporarily increased by +1, up to a maximum damage bonus equal to the wielder’s HD. The damage bonus is lost when the combat ends or after one turn elapses, whichever comes first. Base Cost: 180,000gp (Flail +3 35,000gp, permanent (1/3 turns) 4th level effect 76,000gp, concentration 2nd level esoteric effect 50,000gp, permanent (1/3 turns) *Discern Evil* 1st level effect 19,000gp). Apparent Value: 655gp.

###### Shining Spear

This storied **spear +3, +4 versus undead, +5 versus demons** is crafted of ancient dawn redwood, tipped with a leaf-shaped spearhead of bright orichalcum, and counterbalanced by an orichalcum butt-spike. The speargrants its wielder immunity to fearwhile held. Three times per day by striking the butt-spike on the ground while reciting prayers to the Empyrean gods, the wielder can conjure a glowing *angelic aura*about himself to harm nearby undead for 7 rounds, as the spell. Base Cost: 120,500gp (Spear +3/+4 (2 types)/+5 77,500gp, 3/day *Angelic Aura* 4th level effect 24,000gp, permanent (1/3 turns) 1st level effect 19,000gp). Apparent Value: 3,000gp.

###### Spear +2, Wolf-Fang

This ashen **spear +2, +3 vs animals** is topped by a flat leaf-shaped spearhead of silver and capped by a bronze knob fastened in the shape of a howling wolf. Thrice per day the wielder can spend a round smearing a drop of his own blood over the spear to feel a gnawing in his belly; he will gain his choice of a hungry wolf’s hunting senses or a starving wolf’s heedless ferocity, as the Tracking or Berserkergang proficiency, with either one lasting for six turns. Base Cost: 34,000gp (Spear +2/+3 25,000gp, 3/day 1.5th level effect 9,000gp). Apparent Value: 653gp.

###### War Hammer +2, Dwarven Hurler

Famously used in the Jutting Mountains to cave in both the helm and skull of a frost giant chieftain at 30 paces, this **war hammer +2** is made from king’s steel, with an octagonal head and a grip made of polar bear leather. When wielded by a dwarf, the hammer gains an additional **+1** bonus (becoming a **war hammer** **+3**) and can be hurled with a 60’ range. When hurled, it deals an extra 1d6 extraordinary luminous damage, or 2d6 against giant humanoids. It unerringly returns to the dwarf’s hand after being thrown. Base Cost: 136,000gp. War hammer +3 35,000gp, permanent (1/3 turns) 4th level effect (variable damage bonus when thrown) 76,000gp, permanent (1/turn) 1st level effect (returning to hand) 25,000gp. Apparent Value: 655gp.

#### Armors

The apparent value of any magic armor or shield is 650gp plus the base cost of the armor or shield unless detailed otherwise, equivalent to the value of a masterwork set of armor or shield.

###### Armor of the First Vaultlord

The peerless dwarven smith Korten Khador created many wondrous works in his life. One of his first masterpieces was a flawlessly crafted set of armor worn by the vault lords of Azen Khador and passed down through generations of successors. The ultimate fate of the armor is unknown, but dwarven tradition holds that it rests in the royal tomb of its final wearer. The great work is a set of **plate armor +3**, made to suffer a million blows without defeat and receiving a blow during its creation in anticipation of each of those million, leaving it with a hammered pattern. The armor lacks even a single gap in its protection; said to have been struck so many times that no new blow can surprise it, the wearer is **immune** to all bonus damage and effects normally triggered upon an attack throw with an unmodified die roll of 20, such as from the Weapon Focus proficiency, the vicious decapitating bites of certain dragons and cacodemons, or the **vorpal sword**. Additionally, the grandmaster smith’s million successive blows left the armor so hard that new strikes find little purchase, granting its wearer partial invulnerability to harm. Any mundane physical damage the wearer suffers is reduced by 1 point per die; damage can be reduced to 0, but not less than 0, on each die. Base Cost: 130,000gp. (Plate +3 35,000gp, permanent (1/3 turns) 4th level effect (critical hit immunity) 76,000gp, permanent (1/3 turns) 1st level effect (damage reduction) 19,000gp). Apparent Value 3,000gp.

###### Armor of the Invincible Conqueror

According to legend, the hero Valerian Bellësareus wore the **armor of the invincible conqueror** during his duel with his brother, the ruinguard Acherib, at the height of the Empyrean War. Crafted of gleaming orichalcum, this suit of archaic **plate armor +3** deflects all attacks directed at its wearer which deal mundane damage, causing them to automatically miss. A deflected attack with an area of effect (such as from a siege weapon) rolls for scatter to determine the direction and distance deflected, and can still harm the wearer if he ends up in the area of effect. The armor will not deflect attacks made by silver weapons. Base Cost: 130,000gp (Plate armor +3 35,000gp, permanent (1/3 turns) *Deflect Ordinary Weapons* 5th level effect 95,000gp). Apparent Value 2,500gp.

###### Shield +1, Burden

Famously used by the hero Alpin Hruk to bring back the body of vaultlord Arsic Taran during an hours-long running battle, this circular **shield +1** is 3’ across, with a procession of dwarves carrying heavy loads depicted in a spiral pattern on its face. If the shield is set with its inside facing up and has something placed upon it, it will rise to float at waist level, able to bear up to 50 stone. The shield remains still while within 10’ of the activator, gently following at his speed if he moves away. The shield can be pushed as needed to position it, but ceases floating if moved more than 10’ from the activator, or if tilted from its horizontal alignment (such as to use it as a shield again). Base Cost: 17,000gp (Shield +1 5,000gp, permanent (1/hour) 1st level effect 12,000gp). Apparent Value 660gp.

###### Shield of the Empyrean Heavens

This legendary **shield +4** was brought down from Mt. Audarammas by Azendor, prophet of Ammonar, and used by a succession of heroes during the Empyrean War. Like other shields from that archaic era, the shield of the empyrean heavens is approximately 3’ in diameter, with scooped indentations on either side that give it an hourglass-like shape. It is faced with orichalcum and painted with the symbol of the winged sun. The bearer of the shield is **immune** to all bonus damage and effects normally triggered upon an attack throw with an unmodified die roll of 20, such as from the weapon focus proficiency, the vicious decapitating bites of certain dragons and cacodemons, or the **vorpal sword**. The bearer and all creatures within 5’ of him are **immune** to damage and effects caused by blast spells and spell-like abilities, as the spell **greater blast ward**. Once per day, by clanging his weapon against the shield, the bearer can enable 5 allies within 90’ to move at double their normal speed and make one additional attack on their next initiative, as the spell **holy prayer**. Due to the potency of its enchantment, even most artifact weapons have no chance to sunder the shield. Base Cost: 228,000gp (Shield +4 65,000, permanent (1/hour) *Greater Blast Ward* 6th level permanent effect 72,000gp, permanent (1/3 turns) 4th level effect (critical hit immunity) 76,000gp, *Holy Prayer* 1/day 3rd level effect 15,000gp). Apparent Value 11,000gp.

###### Shield of the Iron Curtain

This distinctive round steel **shield +3** has its spiked boss crafted to depict the roof of a mighty gold-topped citadel viewed from above, ringed on the shield’s face by layer upon layer of gleaming silver walls with bronze-armored dwarves behind them. Borne with distinction by a succession of Meniran heroes during the Beastmen Wars, the legendary shield’s deeds inspired the dwarven military cadence *Asleep Behind the Iron Curtain*. The shield of the iron curtain is carried like a natural extension of its bearer’s arm, instantly readied to turn aside blows, and is wielded as though he has the Fighting Style (weapon and shield) proficiency. The rear of the shield is wholly engraved with a spiral of dwarven litanies of protection and warding, and this magic radiates outward from the shield. Every dwarf within a 30’ radius of the shield receives an additional +1 bonus to their AC (including the shield’s wielder, if a dwarf); if carried on the battlefield, this bonus is granted to up to a company-sized unit of dwarves while the wielder is attached to the unit. This AC bonus is lost if the bearer is slain or drops the shield. Base Cost: 126,000gp (Shield +3 35,000gp, permanent 1st level effect (proficiency) 19,000gp, permanent (1/hr) 6th level effect (AC bonus 30’ radius) 72,000gp). Apparent Value 1,500gp.

### Magic Item Traits (Optional)

The following tables provide a means of making magical items more unique and desirable (or horrific) and inspiring further ideas, without adding extra power beyond possible minor benefits. These traits can be selected by you or rolled as desired, and should reflect the sort of item or its origin. Even odd combinations can be used, however; a **+1 sword of ever-decaying flesh and bone** would make a fine device for a necromantic foe, and its inherent magic would allow it to function normally.

At this end of this section, rules are also included for generating these minor magical traits when crafting magical items – though unless the creator is notably powerful, the results can be unpredictable.

#### Minor Magical Effects in Crafting

With the exception of potions, scrolls, and other magical consumables, there is always a chance that a given magical creation exhibits one or more minor magical trait, as follows:

* Base 1% per 1,000gp of material cost.
* If the total chance exceeds 100%, the excess beyond 100% becomes the chance of a second minor magical trait.
* If the creator is 11th level or higher, they can choose the trait from the appropriate table instead of rolling for it, such is their puissance.

EXAMPLE: Bukhat is creating a **sword +3** (base cost 35,000gp). It has a 35% chance of exhibiting a single minor magical effect.

The table rolled on should be chosen by you based on the creator’s alignment, tendencies, and class; the materials used in the item’s construction; the type of magical item being made; and the location of its forging. An item crafted by one of Ammonar’s faithful and bathed in the full light of the sun every day would likely use the Holy/Lawful table. An item crafted from dark iron, decorated with cut crystal, and buried in the earth every day during its creation would use the Earth table, and so on.

EXAMPLE: Bukhat has crafted his **sword +3** from polished brass, decorated it with cut obsidian and rubies, and held it over flame every day. The Judge assesses that he should roll on the Fire table.

Even if a magic research roll fails, the roll for a minor magical effect should still be made if there is a chance of one.

EXAMPLE: Bukhat does not have a formula for a **sword +3**, so he must make a magic research throw. Unfortunately, Bukhat fails the throw and the sword does not get its +3 bonus! However, he still consults the Fire table for a minor magical effect. Because he is 14th level, he chooses “Heatless fire engulfs it when wielded, illuminating like a candle”. Had he been lower than 11th level, he would have had to roll on the table instead of selecting a result. Bukhat has failed to create an epic sword of fire, but he has created a minor magical item (a sword that illuminates like a torch).

When used in combat, weapons that end up with no bonus to hit or damage but still have a minor magical effect count as silver weapons.
