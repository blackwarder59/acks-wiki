## Step 4: Stock the Dungeon

After the map for the location has been drawn, it’s time to stock the dungeon with dangerous monsters, traps, and treasure. You can choose where to place these, or roll randomly on the **Dungeon Stocking** table.

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Dungeon Stocking** | | |
| **Roll 1d20** | **Contents** | **Treasure** |
| **1-6** | Empty | 15% |
| **7-12** | Monster | If Lair |
| **13-15** | Trap | 30% |
| **16-20** | Unique | As Needed |

Roll on the Dungeon Stocking table once for each room on each level of the dungeon. Each roll can result in either an empty room, a monster encounter, a trap, or a unique dungeon feature. Record the results for each dungeon level separately. Each set of results indicates what will be found on that level of the dungeon. Then assign each result to a specific room according to the interaction between the logic of the dungeon and the nature of the result, following the guidelines below.

EXAMPLE: The Judge has mapped a single level dungeon with fifteen rooms. He rolls on the Dungeon Stocking table fifteen times. He gets four “empty” results, eight “monster” results, two “trap” results, and one “unique” result. His next step will be to place these results onto his dungeon map in a logical (or at least entertaining) manner.
