## Step 5: Create Wandering Monster Tables

You’ll need a set of Wandering Monsters by Level tables both to stock your dungeon and to run it. However, you don’t necessarily need to create a new set of tables for every dungeon. You can, if you’d like, just use the default Wandering Monsters by Level tables we provided earlier in these rules (p. XX) or you can use a set of tables from another dungeon you’ve created or purchased. If you do want to create your own Wandering Monsters by Level tables, read on.

The first consideration in designing random encounter tables is providing a mix of challenges. As you’ll recall from Chapter 2, the Wandering Monsters by Level tables are sub-divided into columns by Monster Level, with 12 rows per column. This structure has been carefully tuned to provide the right mix of foes.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Roll** | **Monster Level 1** |
| **1** | Goblin (2d4) |
| **2** | Kobold (4d4) |
| **3** | Morlock (1d12) |
| **4** | Orc (2d4) |
| **5** | Beetle, Luminous (1d8) |
| **6** | Centipede, Giant (2d4) |
| **7** | Ferret, Giant (1d8) |
| **8** | Rat, Giant (3d6) |
| **9** | Men, Brigand (2d4) |
| **10** | Skeleton (3d4) |
| **11** | Striges (1d10) |
| **12** | NPC Party (Lvl 1) (1d4+2) |

Entries 1-4 are for **beastmen**. Beastmen tend to band together in groups and might be negotiated with if adventurers speak their language. Their organization means that they often set up patrols and call for reinforcements, but also that their internal rivalries and feuds with outsiders can be exploited. At lower dungeon levels, giants and other humanoids replace beastmen.

Entries 5-8 are for **animals**, **vermin**, and **oozes**. Thes are creatures which are mindless or act on instinct. Such monsters fill a role in the dungeon ecology, and also provide scope for adventurers to use spells like *speak with beasts* or gambits like delaying pursuit by dropping sacks of meat.

Entries 9-11 are for **men and monsters**,who often exploit or prey upon the other monsters on the level. This category of monsters is less communal and more independent than beastmen, and more intelligent and/or more supernatural than vermin. Dealing with men and monsters allows adventurers to use their unique solutions to problems, from turning undead to avoiding a petrifying gaze.

The last entry in this category is usually reserved for **NPC parties**, who might be rival adventurers from civilized lands or potent emissaries from monstrous domains; these encounters are especially challenging because NPC parties tend to have goals, capabilities, and ruthless priorities similar to those of the player characters.

An equally important consideration in designing your random encounter tables is making sure the monsters you’ve chosen have an appropriate and varied assortment of treasure. Of course, when encountered as wandering monsters, most won’t be carrying that treasure, but since you’ll also be using these tables to stock your dungeon lairs, it pays to review the treasure types.

Fortunately, having a varied mix of monster roles tends to also ensure a good diversity in treasure. Beastmen tend to be raiders, with sizable but relatively low-level hoards extorted from weaker creatures or received in payment for serving stronger ones. Vermin often have incidental treasure, as many might be attracted to shiny objects or have an ecology that involves gathering the corpses of creatures that do carry wealth. And most hoarders organized or strong creatures powerful enough to gain and defend the highest-value, lowest-bulk treasure – occupy the men and monsters role. For further information on treasure categories, see **Random Treasure Generation** in Chapter 4.

| **Wandering Monster Table Guidelines** | |  |
| **Dungeon Level** | **Party Level** | **Monster XP Value** |
| 1 | 1 | 1-15 |
| 2 | 2-3 | 20-47 |
| 3 | 4-5 | 50-150 |
| 4 | 6-7 | 175-475 |
| 5 | 8-9 | 500-1,140 |
| 6 | 10+ | 1,200+ |

The last, and perhaps most important, factor in creating a wandering monster table is choosing a set of monsters whose capabilities are appropriate to the dungeon level. The Wandering Monster Table Guidelines table indicates the criteria used to design the sample encounter tables above. It is recommended that Judges creating a new table follow these guidelines for selecting most or all of its monsters. While it is certainly desirable for adventurers to face both stronger and weaker monsters, the Random Encounter by Level table consulted when rolling for each encounter will do much to ensure that this is the case. Adventurers will often do the rest, by seeking out depths too dangerous for them or slumming in the shallows which offer little challenge (and little reward). Having random tables that are appropriate to each level thus allows chance, and the equally random factor of player choice, to determine which level’s table comes into play.
