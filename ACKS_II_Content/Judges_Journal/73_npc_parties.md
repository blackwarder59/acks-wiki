## NPC Parties

Wandering monsters may sometimes include parties of NPC adventures out seeking their own fortunes. To determine the composition of an NPC adventuring party, follow the procedure below, or make them up as needed.

Begin by establishing the number encountered by rolling 1d4+2. Then roll 1d100 x 1d100 on the table below to determine a class for each NPC:

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | **NPC Class** | | | | | | | | **1d100x100** | **01-10** | **11-30** | **31-50** | **51-75** | **76-90** | **91-100** | | 1-40 | Mage | Thief | Crusader | Fighter | Explorer | Venturer | | 41-60 | Mage | Bard | Bladedancer | Fighter | Explorer | Venturer | | 61-80 | Mage | Assassin | Priestess | Fighter | Explorer | Venturer | | 81-90 | Mage | Thief | Shaman | Barbarian | Explorer | Venturer | | 91-94 | Elven Spellsword | Elven Nightblade | Dwarven Craftpriest | Dwarven Vaultguard | Special | Special | | 95-96 | Warlock | Special | Witch | Paladin | Special | Special | | 97-98 | Warlock | Special | Witch | Paladin | Special | Special | | 99-100 | Nobiran Wonderworker | Special | Special | Zaharan Ruinguard | Special | Special | | On a result of “Special,” choose a class from ***AXIOMS****,* ***BTA****,* ***Heroic Fantasy Handbook****,* and/or***Player’s Companion***orcreate a custom class. | | | | | | | |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Roll** | **NPC Alignment** |
| **1-2** | Lawful |
| **3-5** | Neutral |
| **6** | Chaotic |

Once classes are established, roll 1d6 to randomly determine the alignment of the party. All NPCs will either be of this alignment, or within one step of it. For example, a Lawful party may have Lawful and Neutral adventurers.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Roll** | **NPC Level** |
| **1** | Base level -2 (min. 1) |
| **2** | Base level -1 (min. 1) |
| **3-4** | Base level |
| **5** | Base level +1 |
| **6** | Base level +2 |

Each NPC party will have a base level, which is the average for the party as a whole. When NPCs are encountered in a dungeon, their base level will be determined by the dungeon level they are encountered on, as shown on the Random Monsters by Level tables. When NPCs are encountered in a wilderness, their base level should be based on the maximum level of the nearest dungeon. When NPCs are encountered in a settlement, their base level is 7, less the settlement’s market class. Once the base level of the party is determined, roll 1d6 on the NPC Level table to determine the level of each NPCs in the party.

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Level** | **TT** | **Level** | **TT** |
| **1** | Bx1/4 | **8** | J |
| **2** | Bx1/2 | **9** | Jx2 |
| **3** | Bx1/2 | **10** | N |
| **4** | B | **11** | O |
| **5** | Dx1/2 | **12** | Nx2 |
| **6** | D | **13** | Q |
| **7** | H | **14** | R |

If desired, you can replace one or more of the NPCs present with 2 NPCs of the same class but two levels lower. These characters would be henchmen of the higher level characters present in the NPC party.

EXAMPLE: An NPC party of three characters with a base level of 9 is generated. It includes a 9th level fighter, a 9th level crusader, and an 8th level thief. The Judge decides to replace the 9th level crusader with two 7th level crusaders, and decides these are the fighter’s henchmen.

NPCs will carry mundane weapons, armor, and equipment appropriate to their class, level, and terrain. When in the wilderness, they will have a 20% chance of having mounts for each level of experience. NPCs will also carry treasure and magic items. Use the table to the right to determine the treasure carried by each NPC based on his level. However, do not roll against the Treasure Type for magic items. Instead, consult the Magic Item Availability by NPC Level table (p. XX). Divide the number of items by 2 (rounding down), as not every item is always carried.

EXAMPLE: To determine a 9th level NPC fighter’s carried treasure, the Judge would roll against Treasure Type J x 2 for coins, gems, and jewelry. Instead of rolling on TT J x 2 for magic items, however, the Judge rolls on the Magic Item Availability by NPC Level, dividing the number of items by 2.
