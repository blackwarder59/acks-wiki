## Abstract Wilderness Encounter Resolution

The interaction between **expedition level** and **monster level** determines the **base difficulty** and **base modifier** to the resolution roll. Consult the table below; find your expedition level in the row for the monster level. (See below if your expedition level is not listed in the row for the monster level.)

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Base Resolution Modifier** | | | | | | | |
|  | **-8** | **-4** | **-2** | **0** | **+2** | **+4** | **+8** |
| **Monster Level** | **Apocalyptic** | **Horrifying** | **Dangerous** | **Accessible** | **Easy** | **Simple** | **Effortless** |
| **1** | - | - | - | 1 | 2-3 | 4-5 | 6-7 |
| **2** | - | - | 1 | 2-3 | 4-5 | 6-7 | 8-9 |
| **3** | - | 1 | 2-3 | 4-5 | 6-7 | 8-9 | 10-11 |
| **4** | 1 | 2-3 | 4-5 | 6-7 | 8-9 | 10-11 | 12-13 |
| **5** | 2-3 | 4-5 | 6-7 | 8-9 | 10-11 | 12-13 | 14 |
| **6** | 4-5 | 6-7 | 8-9 | 10-11 | 12-13 | 14 | - |

### Under- or Over-Strength Parties

If the expedition level is too high or low to appear in the monster level row, move up or down a number of rows until you find the expedition level. Consider the difficulty to be an additional number of columns to the right (easier) for each row you moved down, or an additional number of columns to the left (harder) for each row you moved up. This can also be expressed as a +1 adjustment for each row you moved down, or a -1 adjustment for each row you moved up. A +1 adjustment means to move one column to the right, while a -1 adjustment means to move one column to the left.

### Challenge and Army Adjustments

Once you have found your base difficulty, it is time to apply your other adjustments.

* Add together the Challenge Adjustment of the encounter and the expeditionâ€™s Army Adjustment. If the sum is +2 or lower, adjust the difficulty a number of steps equal to the sum. A positive number indicates a number of columns to the right (easier), while a negative number indicates a number of columns to the left (harder). If the sum is greater than +2, apply a +2 adjustment instead.
* If an expedition has force marched or otherwise become fatigued, apply a -1 adjustment penalty for each day of rest missed. This shifts the difficulty a number of columns to the left (harder).
* If penalties would give you a difficulty harder than Apocalyptic (-8), each further -1 adjustment increases the modifier by -8. That is, if you already have a -8 modifier and have -1 more adjustment, your modifier is -16. If it is -2 beyond Apocalyptic, it is -24, and so on. (Given the way the table works, there is not really a point in calculating modifiers worse than -24. -24 indicates a guaranteed Catastrophic result.)

In no case may you have a difficulty easier than Effortless (+8), regardless of how high your expedition level, Army Adjustment, or other adjustments are. Even the mightiest can be brought down by bad luck.

### The Resolution Table

Once the final difficulty is known, roll 1d8 + 1d12 on the resolution table, adding the modifier for that difficulty.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Abstract Wilderness Resolution** | |
| **Roll (1d8 + 1d12)** | **Result** |
| 2- | Catastrophic |
| 3-5 | Dreadful |
| 6-8 | Unsatisfactory |
| 9-12 | Indifferent |
| 13-16 | Satisfactory |
| 17-19 | Excellent |
| 20+ | Stupendous |

**Catastrophic**: On a Catastrophic result, every participant in the expedition is slain. A new expedition can be sent to retrieve their bodies; if the new expedition successfully finds their corpses and defeats any monsters that may be guarding them, they can retrieve the bodies of the fallen.(They receive experience as normal for encounters defeated.)

**Dreadful:** On a Dreadful result, (1d6) x participants (times scaling modifier) participants suffer mortal wounds. No treasure is earned from this set of encounters.

**Unsatisfactory:** On an unsatisfactory result, (1d4-1) x (scaling modifier) participants suffer mortal wounds. Only 50% of normal treasure is earned from this encounters.

**Indifferent:** On an indifferent result, (1d3-2) x (scaling modifier) participants suffer mortal wounds. 100% of normal treasure is earned from this encounters.

**Satisfactory:**- On a satisfactory result, (1d4-3) x (scaling modifier) participants suffer mortal wounds. 125% of normal treasure is earned from this encounters.

**Excellent:** On an excellent result, (1d6-5) x (scaling modifier) participants suffer mortal wounds. 150% of normal treasure is earned from this encounter.

**Stupendous:** On a stupendous result, no participants suffer mortal wounds, and 200% of normal treasure is earned from this encounter.

### Scaling Modifier

In the wilderness, expeditions tend to be larger than parties in dungeons. In addition, military units might suffer casualties as well. A large expedition suffers more mortal wounds than a small party would. Add up the total number of participants in the expedition (all leveled adventurers, plus the number of platoon-scale units that contributed to Army Adjustment). Divide this number by six to find the **scaling modifier**. Multiply the number of mortal wounds rolled by the scaling modifier. Do not round the scaling modifier; instead, round the modified number of mortal wounds. Round fractions of 0.5 or greater up, and fractions of 0.49 or less down.

EXAMPLE: An expedition consisting of eight leveled characters and six platoon-scale units rolls a result of Unsatisfactory on their resolution roll. Rolling 1d4-1, they roll a 4, indicating a base of three mortal wounds. However, because there are fourteen participants in the expedition, their scaling modifier is (14/6) = 2.33. Three mortal wounds times 2.33 indicates that the expedition suffers seven mortal wounds.

When one or more expedition participants suffer a mortal wound, determine which participant was injured randomly. When randomly determining which participant suffered the wound, no participant can suffer a second wound unless every participant has already suffered one. An adventurer who suffers a mortal wound can no longer participate in the expedition until they recover. Roll on the Mortal Wounds - Savage table using only the adventurer's Constitution, and HD, and equipment modifiers as adjustments to the d20. An adventurer whose mortal wound requires that he be healed to 1 HP dies unless the party can heal the character or bring him back to civilization in the time allotted.

If a unit suffers a mortal wound, 50% of the unit members are casualties. If the resolution result was Indifferent or better, 50% of the casualties will recover in one week. If the resolution result was worse than Indifferent, all the casualties are slain.

In addition, armies in the field are always in danger of attrition and casualties even in a won battle. After the resolution roll, each unwounded unit that benefited the Army Adjustment of the expedition must make a successful Death saving throw or suffer 5% casualties. Casualties will recover or die, as above, based on whether or not the resolution roll was at least Indifferent.

Units that have suffered casualties and are under-strength contribute less to Army Adjustment. Reduce their effective Battle Rating by their percentage under-strength. Round up to the nearest 0.5 BR. Units can be combined if sufficient casualties were suffered.
