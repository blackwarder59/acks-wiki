###### Blast Spell Notes

To prevent low level spells from dealing very high damage, all damaging spells deal variable damage based on the level of the caster. To create damaging spells with a fixed damage, select an appropriate variable damage, and then apply a maximum damage modifier that’s equal to or lower than the caster level required to cast the spell. For example, to cast a 3rd level spell, a caster must be level 5, so if a 3rd level spell deals 1d6 damage per caster level with a maximum of 3d damage, then it effectively deals a flat 3d6 damage.

Blast spells can deal any physical damage type (acidic, arcane, bludgeoning, piercing, poisonous, or slashing). Blast spells with an elemental modifier can deal a physical damage type or an elemental damage type (cold, electric, fire, or seismic).

All damage caused by blast spells is always inflicted instantaneously. Some effects caused by blast spells are inflicted instantaneously. When blast spells deal instantaneous effects, but the spell itself has a duration, the duration can either allow the spellcaster to (a) apply the effect to the same target each round of the duration or (b) to apply the effect to new targets on subsequent rounds. If option (b) is chosen, the spell must be re-targeted each round, with any consequent attack throws and saving throws being re-rolled.

Some effects caused by blast spells have a temporary effect. In this case, the spell’s duration determines how long the effect lasts.

###### Death Spell Notes

To prevent low level spells from dealing very high damage, all damaging spells deal variable damage based on the level of the caster. See **blast spells**, above, for a fuller discussion on these mechanics.

Death spells that target living creatures can deal any physical damage type (acidic, arcane, bludgeoning, piercing, poisoning, slashing) or necrotic damage. Death spells that only target undead deal luminous damage.

Most damage and effects caused by death spells are inflicted instantaneously. When death spells deal instantaneous effects, but the spell itself has a duration, the duration can either allow the spellcaster to (a) apply the effect to the same target each round of the duration or (b) to apply the effect to new targets on subsequent rounds. If option (b) is chosen, the spell must be re-targeted each round, with any consequent attack throws and saving throws being re-rolled.

Some effects caused by death spells have a temporary effect. In this case, the spell’s duration determines how long the effect lasts.

Some death spells have an instantaneous duration but do not take effect immediately. This can represent, e.g., slow-acting poison. A character affected by such a death spell knows he is affected and can take steps to avoid it, such as by using *neutralize poison*.

A death spell that causes a destructive effect on its targets must permit a saving throw, unless the spell has either a targeting factor that limits it by total HD, or a targeting modifier limiting it to creatures of certain HD or less. Death spells that target areas of effect cannot apply modifiers limited to targeting creatures of particular HD because they are not targeting creatures.

###### Detection Spell Notes

Detection spells generally have one of two general effects, discern or locate.

**Discern:** These spells generally allow the caster to discern whether some or all areas, creatures, and objects within range and line of sight possess a particular quality (such as being evil, invisible, magical, poisonous, or textual). In the case of text, the caster learns the gist of its message. In the case of invisibility, the caster sees the invisible creature or object as a translucent shape. In other cases, the caster sees a glow emanating from the area, creature, or object. By default, bewitchment glows rosy pink; curse glows vivid purpureus; evil glows sinister crimson; good glows bright cobalt; magic glows pale yellow; metal glows rust red; poison glows sickly green; ritual magic glows royal purple; treasure glows iridescent gold; and undead glow bone white. Spellcasters can influence this color by their spell signature if desired.

**Locate:** These spells reveals the direction and approximate distance to either the nearest or to a specific area, creature or object within range that possesses a particular quality. If there is nothing qualified in range, the caster learns that instead. If a qualifying area, creature, or object comes into range later in the duration of the spell, the caster will learn the direction and approximate distance at that time. Locate spells can penetrate earth, stone, and wood but are blocked by even a thin sheet of lead or gold.

###### Enchantment Spell Notes

An enchantment spell must either offer a saving throw or have a targeting factor that limits it to some maximum number of HD. If the targeting factor is based on a number of creatures or an area of effect, the spell must offer a saving throw.

In order for an enchantment spell to affect incarnations or undead, it must first be limited to either good or evil creatures. Such a spell can, however, ignore the enchantment immunity these creatures ordinarily possess.

For an enchantment spell to have a targeting modifier limiting it to only creatures of under a certain HD, it cannot have a targeting factor based on a limited number of HD. For instance, you cannot pair “6 HD of creatures” with “creatures with 5 HD or more cannot be targeted. It can be used with an area of effect spell (unlike Death spells), but if so cannot stack with a creature type modifier.

If a spell can target more than one creature, a saving throw modifier can be applied to cause -2 penalty for targeting a single creature. This saving throw modifier cannot be applied to area of effect spells, e.g. you cannot turn an area of effect spell into a single target spell for x1.1!

###### Healing Spell Notes

Damage and trauma cured or caused by healing spells is always inflicted instantaneously. When healing spells are assigned a duration, the duration allows the spellcaster to apply the effect to additional targets on subsequent rounds. For example, a spell curing 1d6+1 damage with a duration of one round per level could heal the same target, or multiple targets, 1d6+1 per round over several rounds.

###### Illusion Spell Notes

One of the least-understood aspects of magic is the nature by which illusion spells function. Some experts mistakenly believe that illusions create actual sensory phenomena. Such theorists claim that when a caster creates an illusion of a horse, an actual image of a horse becomes manifest through magical manipulation of light. However, these sages are unable to explain how an actual sensory phenomenon can be disbelieved. Other experts mistakenly believe that illusions create purely mental phenomenon that exist only in the mind of those who observe the illusion. However, these theorists offer no explanation for how an illusion spell could thereby affect thousands of spectators, many of whom might be out of the line of sight of the caster. This theory would require that a humble *phantasmal figment* be more powerful than the mightiest enchantment! In actuality, illusions work by creating patterns of sensation that hypnotically trigger hallucinations in those who experience the sensations.

Consider a lunatic prone to hallucinations, one whose mother used to bake vanilla cookies for him. One day the lunatic visits a bakery and smells vanilla cookies baking. He immediately experiences powerful memories of his mother, so vivid as to make her seem like she is in the bakery with him. The smell of the vanilla cookies is the pattern of sensation; the image of his mother is the hallucination that it causes in his mind. If the lunatic disbelieves the hallucination of his mother’s presence, the smell of vanilla cookies remains. If the lunatic had nose plugs and could not smell the vanilla cookies, he would not have the hallucination at all. In like manner, a subject who is exposed to a spell’s pattern of sensation is triggered into hallucinating the desired image, sound, or other sensation; disbelieving the experienced sensation reveals the underlying false pattern.

###### Movement Spell Notes

Although the movement spells in ***ACKS II***are relatively innocuous, movement spells as a whole are the most likely type of spell to cause unexpected holistic change to a campaign setting that cause it to depart from its ancient or medieval analogs.

The availability of no-risk teleportation, in particular, radically changes a game world, as does any type of easily accessible flight. Unless you are aiming for a world that is more “fantastical” or “gonzo” than the Auran Empire, we recommend that you restrict flight to spells of 3rd level or higher and forbid long-distance error-free teleportation.

Similarly, broad use of telekinesis on large and weighty objects can radically change a game world’s architecture and building. Therefore, no non-esoteric movement spell can ever grant the ability to move a creature or object weighing more than 285 st/level or 2000 st (spell creator’s choice).

###### Protection Spell Notes

Protection spells come in five types: armors, enhancements, magic invulnerabilities, deflections/resistances/invulnerabilities, and dispels/negations/wards.

**Armors:** Armor spells grant the recipient of the spell a fixed armor class. Armor spellsare not affected by any modifiers to AC except for DEX.

**Enhancements:** Enhancement spells grant the recipient of the spell a bonus to his armor class, saving throw(s), or both. The bonus to AC stacks with both worn armor and any other enhancements to AC except another enhancement spell. The bonus to saving throws stacks with any other bonuses except another enhancement spell.

**Magic Invulnerabilities:** These spells render the recipient immune to one or more individual spells, spells of a certain type, or spells of a certain level. The recipient automatically succeeds on saving throws against the spell(s), and suffers no damage from their effects.

**Deflections/Invulnerabilities/Resistances:** These spells protect the recipient against various types of attacks and damage.

* *Deflections* cause melee and/or missile attacks dealing mundane damage to automatically miss the recipient, as per the spell *deflect ordinary missiles* and *deflect ordinary weapons*.
* *Invulnerabilities* render the target immune to one or more damage types. The recipient automatically succeeds on saving throws against any effects that deal damage of the chosen type(s), and suffers no damage from the chosen type(s).
* *Resistances* render the recipient immune to mundane damage of the chosen type, such that it automatically succeeds on saving throws against spells or effects that deal mundane damage of the chosen type. It also becomes resistant to extraordinary damage of the chosen type. The recipient reduces the extraordinary damage dealt by the chosen type by half and gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against spells or special abilities that deal extraordinary damage of the chosen type.

**Dispels/Negations/Wards:** Dispels extinguish spell and spell-like effects, as per the spell *dispel magic*. Dispels with an instantaneous duration take effect upon casting. Dispels with a longer duration take effect when a creature, object, or spell enters or exits its area of effect or attempts to affect its recipient (as in *anti-magic sphere*). An inherent aspect of casting a *dispel magic* is that the caster must make an attack throw versus each spell or spell-like effect he might extinguish, as described in the spell *dispel magic.* (A saving throw can be applied on top, as with *counterspell*).

Negations render activated, at-will, and charged magic items temporarily inert and unable to be used for the duration of the spell. They have no effect on permanent items.

Wards against creatures protect the recipient against a particular creature or creature type, as per the spell *holy circle*. Wards against spells (spellwards) protect the recipient against spells, as per the spell *spellward*.

###### Summoning Spell Notes

Most summoning spells meet one of three formats, each of which follows its own rules. Following, or not following, these formats change the source modifier for the spells.

**Callings:** A callis a spell that summons creatures to arrive by means of their own locomotion (x0.66) with a duration of at least 1 day (x1.5). A call must target a specific type of creature (x0.7). A call always takes one turn to cast (x0.8). Called creatures are controlled with speech and gesture (x0.8). Called creatures always cooperate with the caster as if **bewitched** (x1).The range of a calling is usually 10’ (x1). By fiat, if the same calling is cast again while the creature called is still alive, it keeps the creature(s) around for another day. A call cannot require concentration and cannot be limited by castings per day. It cannot permit a saving throw. A calling cannot be used to summon a sapient creature.

**Conjurations**: A conjuration is a spell thatsummons powerful creatures to serve the caster for a short period of time of up to 1 day (x1.5). Conjured creatures are always actively hostile (x0.6) and must be controlled through concentration (x0.6). The duration must be at least 6 turns (x0.75). The range of a conjuration must be at least 240’ (x1.33). A conjuration can permit a saving throw, rolled by the creature being conjured. If the creature’s save succeeds, it appears but not is controlled.

**Summonings:** Spells thatsummon one or more creatures for extended periods of time with a duration of at least 1 day (x1.5). Summoned creatures are always passively hostile (x0.8), following the caster’s commands but in the least cooperative manner possible. They can be controlled telepathically (x1) or by speech and gesture (x0.8). Summonings are limited by frequency of casting, to no more than once per day (x0.9) for a day’s duration or once per week (x0.8) for longer durations, so that a caster cannot have an endless number of summoned creatures dispatched at once. A summoning can permit a saving throw, rolled by the creature being summoned. If the save succeeds, the creature learns the name and location of its summoner, and does not appear

Range is the range at which a creature can be mentally given commands. If this range is exceeded, the creature cannot be given new commands and if concentration is required to control the creature, it breaks free of control. If the creature is summoned from thin air, range is also the maximum range at which it can first appear from the caster. Range is largely irrelevant to called creatures controlled with speech and gesture.

Unless otherwise noted, a summoned creature does not gain any power to communicate with its controller, nor does the controller gain access to its senses. He commands his creatures with each speech and gesture (crudely, if the creature is not sapient!) or with one-way telepathic commands. Actively hostile creatures must be controlled with total concentration. Cooperative or passively hostile creatures can be given general commands, though the latter will attempt to subvert them where possible.

###### Transmogrification Spell Notes

By default, the target of a transmogrification must be a man-sized creature. Targeting larger creatures requires applying a modifier of x1.25 to x2. Targeting smaller creatures requires applying a modifier of x2. This limitation is particularly important for transmogrification spells that affect the current form of the creature.

Transmogrification spells that transform the creature into a new form are not limited by the size of the new form (only the original form). However, they have other complexities, as the transmogrification entails differentiating physical form, physical characteristics, physical attacks, special abilities, and mental abilities.

**Physical Form:** The creature’s general body plan including number of limbs and general distribution of fat and muscle; the creature’s exterior characteristics such as texture, shape, and color of hair, skin, scales, feathers; and its facial visage and appearance.

**Physical Characteristics**: The creature’s size, weight, armor class, and movement rate, including special movement types such as climbing, flying, and swimming, provided that doing so is a result of their body form and not magic. The monster special abilities of Flying, Swiftness, and Tough are implicitly included in this.

**Physical Attacks:** The creature’s attack routine, including its number of attacks, attack throws, and damage. The monster special abilities Acid, Bonus Attack, Charge, Dive, Grab/Restrain, Hug, Lightning Reflexes, Ongoing Damage, Special Senses, Stealth, Swallow Attack, Topple and Fling, Trample, and Vicious Bite are generally included in this, although the Judge has final say about whether a particular special ability is “physical.”

**Special Abilities:** The creature’s special or spell-like abilities that are not included under Physical Characteristics or Attacks. The monster special abilities Aura, Berserk, Breath Weapon, Beguile/Enthrall, Class Powers/Proficiencies, Dreadful, Enervation, Enslave, Horrific, Immunity, Incorporeal, Infectious, Invisibility, Magic Resistance, Ongoing Damage, Paralysis, Petrification, Regeneration, Resistance, Spellcasting, Spell-like Abilities, Terrifying, and Unusual abilities are covered by this.

A default transmogrification allows the new form to have one \* worth of special abilities. Custom spells can permit more special abilities. If a new form has more special abilities than granted by the spell, you chooses which special abilities are gained, starting with the form’s weakest special abilities.

**Mental Abilities:** The creature’s alignment, behavioral traits, mental ability, morale score, and natural instincts. If the new form is as or more intelligent than the old form, the creature remembers its former life as if a dream. If the new form is substantially less intelligent, the target does not remember its former life at all. This effect is usually only applied to forms with bestial or semi-sapient intellect, because it is substantially more costly to grant the mental abilities of a sapient form.

###### Wall Spell Notes

A wall thickness modifier can only be applied if wall can be affected as iron, stone, earth, flesh, or wood (e.g. it has SHP or hit points). Otherwise the wall thickness modifier is x1, as the thickness is irrelevant to the spell’s effectiveness.
