## Step 2: Map the Settlement

Now it’s time to map your settlement. You can either find a map of an existing city (historical or fantastical) and “re-purpose” it to serve as your settlement; randomly generate a settlement using one of the many online tools; or draw the map yourself. Because building styles can vary widely, there are no fixed rules about how many buildings to have on your map. Some historical cities, such as Rome, organized the inhabitants into multi-story apartment buildings that would not have been out of place in a modern metropolis. Others, such as medieval London, consisted of densely-packed one- or two-story homes and shops. You’ll want to place somewhere between 3 buildings per 5 families to 5 buildings per 3 families, depending on the architecture.

However, there are a number of points of interest that are valuable for gameplay that we recommend for most starting settlements:

* A barracks for the army, city watch, legion, or other military force that guards the city
* A bathhouse, bawdyhouse, cantina, inn, and/or taverns where adventurers can learn rumors and spend gold like the wastrels they are.
* A dock, harbor district, or other maritime hub, if the settlement is on a river bank or shoreline.
* An emporium, bazaar, forum, or plaza where adventurers can purchase equipment and merchandise
* A merchant’s guildhouse, bank, or other chamber of commerce where investing and lending can occur
* A mercenary’s guildhouse where adventurers can find work and hire mercenaries or henchmen
* A municipal building such as a palace, city hall, and/or court for the seat of government
* A temple where prayerful casters and worshippers congregate
* A thieves’ quarter for the local criminal syndicate where assassins, thieves, and other unsavory sorts find work
* A tower of knowledge, wizard’s college, or other place of learning where studious casters come together

The number and grandeur of these points of interest will vary with the size of your settlement. For instance, in ***AX1 Sinister Stone of Sakkara****,* the settlement is just a village of 110 families. Its “academy” is a small chapterhouse building attached to the prefect’s fort, where one mid-level and a few low-level mages assist the legate. It’s “merchant’s guildhouse” is a booth in the agora. In contrast, in ***AX3 Capital of the Borderlands****,* the “academy” is the Tower of Knowledge, with dozens of mages organized in a collegiate environment, and the merchant’s guildhouse is a large complex with a bank vault.
