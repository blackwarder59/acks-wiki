## Dwarven Custom Classes

Dwarvesbelieve that they were forged by the hand of Istreus when the world was young, and were first taught the secrets of metal-work and machinery by the god himself. For centuries the stout, cunning people delved vast vaults in the Meniri and Jutting Mountains, gathering rich ores and creating enduring works of stone and iron. Eventually they came into contact with the expanding elven and human peoples of Aurëpos. These meetings were not peaceful, and the dwarven rhetors still recite tales of ancient battles that the elves and humans have long forgotten.

When the Aurans launched the great Empyrean War against Zahar, the dwarves took no part. The mighty automatons and war machines of the dwarves would have greatly aided in securing victory over the Zaharans, but the dwarves saw little cause in joining one faction of men in fighting another faction of men. History has shown the dwarves’ decision not to intervene to be a terrible error in judgment, however. When the Aurans defeated Zahar, they were too exhausted to fully cleanse the land of the beastmen. In the absence of constant warfare to reduce their numbers, the beastman population exploded. The beastmen were largely kept out of the north by elven and human garrisons, and soon migrated into the mountains in great numbers. The dwarves soon found themselves in a never-ending war for their own tunnels and vaults. Today, the dwarves are a dying race barely clinging to the last of their vaults in the great Meniri and Jutting Mountains. They constantly seek new artifacts and war machines to make up for ever dwindling numbers.

Dwarven character classes are created using the dwarven racial category and experience points. Requirements, class category values, hit points per level after 9th, and experience point progressions are modified as noted below.

### Requirements

All dwarven classes require a minimum Constitution 9 or better.

### Class Category Values

**Fighting:** Due to their short stature, dwarves may never use two-handed swords or longbows, regardless of their Fighting Value. Dwarves with narrow or broad weapon selections must include at least four axes, flails, hammers, and/or maces among their selections.

**Divine:** Dwarves who reach the 9th level of Divine spellcasting are eligible to create Constructs, as if they were 11th level crusaders.

**Arcane:** Dwarves can never allocate build points to the Arcane category.

**Designer’s Note:** The ***By This Axe***sourcebook introduces a new class category value called Gnostic, which is used by the earthforger and furnacewife classes in that cyclopedia.

### Dwarf Value

When building a dwarven custom class, assign between 0 and 4 build points to the class’s Dwarf Value. At Dwarf 0, all dwarves gain the following four dwarven custom powers:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Value** | **Dwarf** | **XP Cost** |
| 4 | Dwarf +4 proficiencies | 1250 |
| 3 | Dwarf +3 proficiencies | 900 |
| 2 | Dwarf +2 proficiencies | 600 |
| 1 | Dwarf +1 proficiencies | 400 |
| 0 | Dwarf | 200 |

* **Sensitivity to Rock and Stone:** All dwarves gain a +1 bonus to surprise rolls when underground. When using Adventuring proficiency to search or listen, they succeed on a proficiency throw of 14+ (instead of the usual 18+). If separately proficient in Searching they gain a +4 bonus to their throw instead. If separately proficient in Listening, they gain a +2 bonus to their throw instead.
* **Dwarf Tongues:** All dwarves speak four bonus languages: Dwarf, Gnome, Goblin, and Kobold.
* **Hardy:** All dwarves gain a +3 bonus on Blast saving throws and a +4 bonus on all other saving throws.

Additional points allocated to the Dwarf Value represents the dwarven expertise in crafts and lore. Each point provides one bonus general proficiency as well as a +1 bonus on proficiency throws and thief skills. The bonus does *not* apply to the racial ability to Search and Listen, as that proficiency throw’s target value already reflects the full measure of dwarven expertise. It also does not apply to proficiency throws to rebuke undead, which is a miracle of faith and unaffected by attention to detail.

EXAMPLE: The dwarven craftpriest has Dwarf Value 3. The dwarven craftpriest began with 3 bonus general proficiencies and gains +3 to all proficiency throws.

### Hit Points per Level after 9th

Dwarves receive an extra 1 hp per level after 9th, in addition to hit points gained based on their saving throw progression.

### Experience Point Progression After 8th level

Dwarves using the fighter progression increase the amount of experience required to gain each level after 8th by 10,000XP. Dwarves using the crusader or thief progression increase the amount of experience required to gain each level after 8th by 30,000XP.
