## Step 5: Generate Dynamic Buildings

Now that you’ve detailed a few points of interest, you’re settlement is ready for use. It would be impractical to generate every one of your starting settlement’s buildings in advance. Moreover, it would be unrealistic! Cities are dynamic and everchanging and no one knows what lies down every alley. When the adventurers decide to explore your city, just follow the steps below to procedurally generate buildings to populate the city blocks.

1. Assign the building to a size category (small, medium, large, or huge).
2. Roll on the Building Type by Size table to determine the type of building.
3. Roll on the appropriate Occupant tables to determine who lives in the structure.
4. Roll 1d100 on the Building Styles tables to determine how it was built.
5. Determine treasure in the building (if necessary).

### Building Size

**Small buildings** range from 100 sf to 450 sf, averaging 250 sf (16’ x 16’). Small buildings might be cots (one-room dwellings), small shops or shophouses, storage shacks, cantinas, outhouses, small shrines, or hutches for small animals.

**Medium buildings** range from 500 sf to 1,700 sf, averaging 1,000 sf (33’ x 33’). Medium buildings are usually townhouses, medium shops or shophouses, or storage depots. A few are brothels, cantinas, or private baths. Medium buildings have a 25% chance to be sub-divided into 4 (2d3) small buildings, in which case you should roll once for Building Type by Size on the Small column. (All buildings will be of that type.)

**Large buildings** range from 1,750 sf to 3,450 sf, averaging 2,500 sf (50’ x 50’). Large buildings can be any building type except cot. Most are townhouses, villas, large shops or shophouses, manufactories, warehouses, inns, private baths, stables, or taverns. Large buildings have a 25% chance to be sub-divided into 10 (4d4) small buildings, in which case you should roll once for Building Type by Size on the Small column.

**Huge buildings** are 3,500 sf or more. Huge buildings are usually villas, manufactories, or warehouses, with a few private baths, public latrines, and temples. Huge buildings have a 25% chance to be sub-divided into 7 (2d6) medium buildings, in which case you should roll once for Building Type by Size on the Medium column.

To determine the type of building, roll 1d100 and cross-reference the result of the die with the appropriate column by size.

To avoid taking out your ruler to measure sizes, use this rule of thumb to evaluate your map: buildings you have to squint to even see are small; buildings you can see in clusters are medium; buildings you can easily see are large; and buildings that you instantly spot because they are noticeably larger than the rest of the block are huge.

### Building Type and Occupants

#### Cots and Townhouses

Cots are simple one-room dwelling places. They might be apartments in a huge building, single-story rowhouses crammed wall-to-wall, or freestanding shacks or hovels.

Townhouses are two-story multi-room dwelling places. Townhouses typically share their walls with adjacent buildings, but some are freestanding. A huge building might consist of a number of townhouses sharing a single roof, sometimes organized around a central courtyard.

Small cots have 1d4 occupants, medium cots have 2d3, medium townhouses have 2d4, and large townhouses have 2d6 occupants. The first two occupants are the owner/tenant(s); the next three are their dependents (children or elderly). Any additional residents are household servants (cooks, scullions, or maidservants) of the owner/tenants.

Roll 1d100 on the appropriate column of the Owner/Tenant by Building Type table (below) to determine the occupations of the owner/tenants. Roll on the Character Class and Character Level tables (below) for any classed occupants.

One of the owner/tenants has a 90% chance to be elsewhere by day. The other has a 50% chance. If both owner/tenants are absent, then any dependents will also be absent, unless servants are present.

#### Villas

Villas are luxurious two-story multi-room dwelling places with an interior courtyard. Villas can share one or more walls with other buildings, but many are freestanding. When freestanding, they often have paved walkways or gardens around their exteriors.

All villas have 2d4 patrician occupants. The first two patricians are the owners; the next four are their dependents (children or elderly). Any additional patrician occupants are siblings and cousins of owners. There is a 1 in 6 chance that one of the patricians is a fighter or similar classed character.

Villas also have occupants who serve and protect the patricians. Large villas have a cook, a maidservant, a scullion, and 1d3+1 household guards. Huge villas have a cook, 1d2 maidservants, 1d2 scullions, 1d3+1 household guards, and a guard captain (fighter or similar classed character). Roll on the NPC Class (Fighter) and NPC Level tables for any classed occupants.

The owners of the villa have a 75% chance each to be absent by day. The other occupants have a 25% chance to be absent.

#### Shops and Manufactories

Shops are single-story places of business open to the public. Some are workshops where artisans manufacture goods, while others are merchant’s stores which sell goods manufactured elsewhere or offer services. Roll 1d6. On 1-2, the shop is a merchant’s store. On 3-6, the shop is an artisan’s workshop.

Small stores are occupied by a single merchant (either a guild apprentice running a subsidiary or an unlicensed peddler or huckster). Medium stores are run by a guild-licensed merchant with two apprentices. Large stores are occupied by a master merchant supervising two licensed merchants and four apprentices. Roll 1d100 on the Merchant Occupation table to determine the type of merchants. Note that 1 in 4 master merchants belong to the venturer class; roll on the NPC Level table if so.

Small workshops are occupied by a single artisan (often a journeyman). Medium workshops are occupied by a master artisan supervising two journeymen and four apprentices. Large workshops are occupied by two master artisan with a staff of four journeymen and eight apprentices. Roll 1d100 on the Artisan Occupation table to determine the type of artisans.

Manufactories are huge one-story buildings where goods are manufactured by teams of artisans. Unlike shops, they are not open to the public; they sell at wholesale prices to the various dealers, merchants, and retailers in the city, and to traders for long-distance commerce. Manufactories employ 2d6 teams of master artisans with a full complement of staff supported by an additional 4d6 manual laborers. Roll 1d100 on the Artisan Occupation table to determine the type of artisans.

Shops and manufactories are always occupied by day. At night, the shop or manufactory will be locked and barred and the workers at home.

**Doing Business in Shops:** If appropriate to their occupation, merchants and artisans will sell armor, weapons, clothing, equipment, mounts, vehicles, etc. Small shops have equipment available equal to 10% the equipment availability of Cyfaraun (see Equipment Availability by Market Class in ***ACKS II******Revised Rulebook***). Medium shops have equipment availability at 25% overall equipment availability, and large shops have equipment availability at 50% overall. If adventurers achieve friendly (12+) reactions with merchants and artisans, they might directly buy or sell merchandise in bulk, bypassing the mercantile interests at the Guildhouse. The Merchant Occupation and Artisan Occupation tables shows what type of merchandise (if any) the merchant or artisan is interested in. Each master artisan or master merchant can buy or sell the base amount of merchandise for his market each day. An independent guild-licensed merchant can buy or sell half the base amount of merchandise per month. Transactions with individual merchants friendly to the adventurer do not count against the adventurer’s market impact.

EXAMPLE: The adventurers enter a medium shop in a Class III settlement. The Judge rolls a 2 on 1d6, so the shop is a merchant’s store. It is occupied by a guild-licensed merchant with two apprentices. He rolls 1d100 on the Merchant Occupation table and gets a 45, so the merchant is a furrier. In addition to selling various fur capes, cloaks, and garments, the furrier might transact in common furs (12 st per day), monster parts (4 st per day) or rare furs (3 st per day) with adventurers if they achieve friendly reactions.

#### Shophouses

**Shophouses** are one- or two-story establishments with a place of business on the first floor and a dwelling on the second floor. Small shophouses have a small shop with a cramped backroom or loft above the workspace. Medium shophouses have a medium shop with a second-story apartment accessed by stairs from a back room. Large shophouses have a large shop on the first floor and a townhouse on the second. Shop staff is as for shops.

Roll 1d6. On 1-2, the shop is a merchant’s store. On 3-6, the shop is an artisan’s workshop. Shophouse staff will be as Shop, above. In addition to the workers, a small shophouse has 1d3 additional occupants, a medium shophouse has 2d4-1 additional occupants, and a large shophouse has 2d6-1 additional occupants. The first four additional occupants are spouses or dependents of the workers. Any additional occupants are household servants.

Shophouses are always occupied by day. At night, the shop will be locked and barred but the owner and any family will still be present.

#### Depots

Depots are buildings used to store goods. A small depot is a storage shack, usually owned by a resident. A medium depot is a large storage unit owned by a nearby business. Large and huge depots are warehouses for the goods that the city’s residents eat, wear, and work with. Depots that contain grain or other goods spoiled by moisture are typically two stories tall, with lofts to keep the merchandise high and dry. Depots that contain wine or other merchandise ruined by heat have sunken floors where amphorae can be kept cool. Huge warehouses might have both.

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Depot Merchandise** | | | |
| **Depot**  **Size** | **Number of**  **Merch Types** | **Merchandise** | **Depot**  **Workers** |
| Small | 1 | 2d4! x 200gp | 1 (5%) |
| Medium | 1 | 2d4! x 400gp | 1d6 (5%) |
| Large | 1d4 | 2d4! x 600gp | 1d6 (10%) |
| Huge | 1d8 | 2d4! x 800gp | 2d6 (10%) |

The value of the merchandise in a depot will vary based on the warehouse’s size. The merchandise may be all of one type, or of up to eight different types. You should determine the specific merchandise based on the settlement’s demand modifiers. During the day, depot workers may be present, loading or unloading cargo, as indicated on the table. At night, depots with precious merchandise will be protected by one guard per 3,000gp of precious merchandise (rounded up) with one 3rd level sergeant per 10 guards (rounded down).

#### Bawdyhouses

Bawdyhousesare places of business where prostitutes offer their services. Even where prostitution is legal, it is not usually very respectable, and most bawdyhouses are run by or under the “protection” of a criminal syndicate. Both men and women work the bawdyhouses, offering virtually any salacious experience a discerning patron might desire. Prostitutes range from impoverished to wealthy, depending on their beauty, upbringing, and skills. In the average bawdyhouse, a few moments of pleasure costs 2sp, while a night of pleasure costs 1gp. Prices can be 10 times as much in upscale establishments catering to patricians.

Small bawdyhouses are one-room dwellings occupied by a single prostitute. Medium bawdyhouses are bordellos with several rooms, occupied by 2d3 prostitutes and run by a brothelkeeper. Large bawdyhouses are multi-story brothels run by a brothelkeeper with 1d6 1st level thieves or assassins for security and 4d6 prostitutes offering a variety of services in numerous private rooms. The brothelkeeper will be a thief or related sub-class – roll on the NPC Class and NPC Level tables. There will be one patron per two prostitutes (50% chance of one patron in a small bawdyhouse). The occupation of any patrons can be generated randomly on the General/Street column of the Building Occupants by Type table.

#### Cantinas

Cantinasare grab-and-go eateries popular with urban workers. A typical cantina has a countertop pierced with numerous recesses, each containing insulated pottery jars filled with ready-to-eat food and drink. Behind the countertop, the owner or cook works a stovetop where pots and pans simmer with food. Large cantinas may have dining tables for sit-down meals but medium and small cantinas just have stools at the countertop or no seating at all.

Here’s a typical menu for a cantina in the Auran Empire campaign setting:

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Item** | **Cost** | **Item** | **Cost** |
| Bran bread loaf (1lb) | 1cp | Boiled greens with fish sauce | 1cp |
| Wheat biscuit with honey | 1cp | Pickled beets | 2cp |
| Wheat toast with salt, olives, and fish sauce | 2cp | Boiled lentils with almonds | 3cp |
| Wheat toast with cheese, onions, and ham | 2cp | Dried figs with honey | 3cp |
| Wheat meal porridge, one bowl | 3cp | Vinegar and water | 1cp |
| Pair of hardboiled eggs with fish sauce | 1cp | Barley water and honey | 1cp |
| Pair of fried eggs with salt and pepper | 1cp | Fermented wheat porridge | 1cp |
| Blood sausage with egg, onion, and pepper (4oz) | 2cp | Milk and honey | 2cp |
| Fresh-cooked spicy pork sausage (4oz) | 3cp | Watered local wine | 2cp |
| Fried pork sausage with field mushrooms | 2cp | Warm spiced Krysean wine | 5cp |
| Salted chickpea pancakes | 3cp | Honeyed Tirenean wine | 1sp |

A small cantina is serviced by a cantinakeeper in front, with a loft or backroom affording a residence for 1d3 additional occupants. There will be 1d3 patrons during mealtimes. A medium cantina is serviced by a cantinakeeper and will feature a second-story apartment with 2d4-1 additional occupants. There will be 2d6 patrons during mealtimes. A large cantina is serviced by a cantinakeeper and scullion, with 4d6 patrons during mealtime. A second-story townhouse will contain an additional 2d4+1 occupants. The first four additional occupants are the spouse and dependents of the cantinakeeper. Any additional occupants are household servants (cook, scullion, and maidservants).

#### Taverns

Taverns are one-story establishments that serve made-to-order meals alongside beer, wine, or both. A tavern might include gambling facilities (sometimes in a basement or backroom) as well as private rooms for sexual services. A tavern will be occupied by a tavernkeeper, a cook, a scullion, 1d3 tavernworkers, and 2d6+2 patrons. Taverns do not offer lodging or stables, but there will be a backroom or loft for the tavernkeeper’s 1d4 dependents. If the tavern is in the thieves’ quarter, there might be 1d2 footpads and 1d2 thugs providing security, and 1d4 prostitutes plying the crowd. The basement of a tavern can make a good hideout for a criminal guild. Here’s a typical menu for a tavern in the Auran Empire campaign setting, with higher-end food than a cantina:

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Food** | **Cost** | **Drinks** | **Cost** |
| Wheat biscuit with honey | 1cp | Vinegar and water | 1cp |
| Boiled green beans in fish sauce | 1cp | Krysean barley beer and honey | 2cp |
| Boiled lentils with almonds | 2cp | Opelenean plum wine mixed with rose water | 5cp |
| Pickled beets | 2cp | Corcanosi raisin wine mixed with honey | 5cp |
| Pickled olives and capers | 2cp | Tirenean sweet sparkling rose wine mixed with honey | 1sp |
| Fried cucumbers drizzled with honey | 2cp | Tirenean dry white wine mixed with honey | 1sp |
| Blood sausage with egg, onion, and pepper | 2cp | Tirenean sweet white wine mixed with honey and rose petals | 2sp |
| Pork stew with apples and honey | 3cp | Tirenean dry white wine with wormwood and saffron | 5sp |
| Fried mullet fish with olive oil and lemon | 5cp | Tirenean sweet white wine with pepper, saffron and cinnamon | 5sp |
| Roast mutton with chopped almonds and garlic | 1sp | Argollëan honeyed ambrosia with saffron and cinnamon | 5sp |

Most taverns will offer live entertainment at night; roll on The Tavern Entertainment table each evening that adventurers visit. Some entertainment might even draw additional patrons. Each entertainer has a 25% chance to be a 1st level bard.

| 20 | Troupe of 2d6+4 jongleurs engaged in farcical extravaganza with bawdy humor, faux fighting, acrobatics, dance, and music | +4d6 |

#### Inns

Innsare two-story establishments that offer meals like a tavern along with lodging for guests. A typical inn is organized around a tavern on the first story, occupied by the innkeeper, 1 cook, 1 scullion, 1d3 tavernworkers, 1d3 maidservants, and 2d6+2 patrons. On the second floor there will be lodging for the innkeeper and his 1d4 family members (spouse and dependents), plus rooms for guests. Stalls for 2d4 mounts will be available in the rear. 1d4x25% of the rooms and stalls will be vacant. 1d4 private rooms and 1d2 common rooms might be available on any given night.

#### Bathhouses

Bathhousesafford wealthy patrons the opportunity to bath away from the (literally) unwashed masses who descend upon the city’s Public Baths. Medium bathhouses have one story consisting of an atrium/changing room, a cold-water bath, and a warm lounge, with 1d4-1 patrons in each room, and one bath attendant in the atrium. Large private baths add a hot plunge bath and a dry sauna. Large baths will have 1d4+1 patrons in each room, 1d3 attendants in the warm lounge, and 1 attendant in the atrium. Huge private baths add a garden, gymnasium, latrine, or library. They have 1d4+4 patrons in each room, 1d4+4 attendants in the warm lounge, and 1 attendant in the atrium.

Reaction rolls with patrons of the bathhouses are at +1 due to their collegial atmosphere. The cost of using the bathhouse is kept low (2cp) to promote public hygiene.

#### Public Latrines

Public latrinesare one-story establishments. A small public latrine is simply an outhouse with a seat that opens onto the sewers below. 50% have an occupant at any time. Large and huge public latrines feature one or more rows of seats built over sewer line. A moat in front of the seats is furnished with sponges on sticks, with which patrons can wipe themselves. Large latrines will have 2d6 patrons, while huge will have 5d6. Reaction rolls in the latrine suffer a -2 penalty, as no one likes being bothered on the toilet.

#### Shrines

Shrines are one-story private places of worship or veneration of the dead erected by the settlement’s patrician or wealthy merchants. Small shrines usually commemorate an exalted ancestor or family line but might also be dedicated to a god in a particular aspect. For instance, a small shrine on Gambler’s Row might be dedicated to Calefa in her aspect as goddess of fortune. Small shrines have a single caretaker (roll on the Minor Ecclesiastic Occupation table) who cares for its idols and symbols by day. There is a 25% chance that 1d4 worshippers are present.

Huge shrines are dedicated to a particular god or even an entire pantheon. Huge shrines have a cleric or priestess as caretaker (roll on the NPC Class and NPC Level tables to determine sub-class and level) with 1d4 assistants (roll on the Minor Ecclesiastic Occupation table for each). There is a 75% chance that 3d6 worshippers are present.

#### Stables/Pens

Stables/pensare dwellings for domestic animals. Several different types of animals live in small stables/pens. Roll 1d8 or choose: On 1-3, it’s a coop with 6d10 chickens. On 4, it’s a kennel with 1d6 dogs. On 5, it’s a sty with 1d6 pigs. On 6, it’s a hutch with 4d10 rabbits. On a 7, it’s a shed with 2d6 goats. On an 8, it’s a stable with 1d3 donkeys. By day there is a 50% chance of one laborer at the pen.

Large stables/pens contain a mix of draft and riding animals. At any time, there will be a total of 2d6 donkeys, 1d8 mules, 1d6 medium draft or riding horses, 1d4 heavy draft horses, and 1d2 light riding horses, as well as a stablehand who grooms, feeds, and washes them. During daylight hours, an additional 1d4 stablehands will be present.

### Building Occupant Tables

As noted above, some types of buildings always have particular types of occupants. For instance, villas are always owned by patricians, and inns are always owned by innkeepers. These occupants are summarized in the Standard Occupants by Building Type table.

Other types of buildings have random occupants. You can use the Random Occupant by Building Type table to randomly determine the occupation, class, and level (if any) of such buildings. For Artisans, roll on the Artisan Occupation table. For merchants, roll on the Merchant Occupation table. For other building occupants roll on the appropriate column of the Random Occupant by Building Type table. (Use the General/Street column for encounters on the streets, baths, or other public places where adventurers might run into just about anyone.)

Roll on sub-tables as directed. Never roll on the Random Building Occupant tables for dependent occupants. Dependents (children, disabled family members, elders, or spouses devoted to domestic duties) are just that.

Some table results directly indicate a classed NPC. These represent characters who practice their class full-time. Other table results indicated there is a percentage chance the character of that occupation belongs to a particular character class. These represent individuals who either are retired from their class or who primarily pursue another occupation instead of their class.

(Note that relative to the total number of classed individuals, there are more full-time clerics and mages than full-time fighters and thieves. There are, nevertheless, many more fighters and thieves than clerics and mages. It’s just that many fighters and thieves are found running inns, working as marshals, etc.)

When a classed character appears, roll on the NPC Level sub-table to determine their specific level unless a level is already noted. If the class is listed as fighter, mage, crusader, or thief, you can either roll on the NPC Class sub-table for a sub-class or assume it is the default.

For more information about NPCs, see **Chapter 9: Non-Player Characters** (p. XX).

### Building Treasure

Adventurers might decide to burglarize a building. Buildings contain coin equal to 1.5 x the wages of the non-dependent occupants. Itinerant occupants (such as bathhouse patrons) carry coin equal to their wages/20. Coin will be in the ratio 1:10:100 gold : copper : silver. Shops and manufactories also contain goods with value of equal to 1d6x earnings. The remainder of the occupants’ wealth is in building, land, fixtures, tools, personal items, etc.

EXAMPLE: A medium workshop is staffed by a master gemcutter (80gp per month), two journeymen (20gp per month) and four apprentices (10gp per month), for total earnings of 160gp per month. The gemcutter’s workshop contains 240gp in coin and 1d6x240gp in merchandise. The Judge rolls a 5, so the workshop has 1,200gp in uncut and freshly-cut gems.
