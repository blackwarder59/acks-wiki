Next, you must choose the type of dungeon you are creating. Many dungeons are underground complexes of hallways and chambers. But dungeons can also twisting natural caverns, catacombs, tombs, crumbling towers, huge temples, unbreakable castles, ruined cities, or any other structure imaginable. To randomly determine the dungeon’s type, roll 1d20 on the Dungeon Type table.

If you are using the Auran Empire setting, Auran dungeons will often be barrow mounds, crumbling castles, prisons, ruined villas, sewers, or towers; dwarven dungeons will be abandoned mines, tombs, or underground vaults; elven ruins will be lost cities or treetop settlements; and Thrassian and Zaharan dungeons will be catacombs, cliff cities, crumbling castles, prisons, sunken cities, temples, tombs, towers, and wizard’s dungeon;
