## Step 1: Estimate Realm Size

The **ACKS Regional Map** hex sheet that you used for your sandbox is 31.5 hexes tall and 49 hexes wide, with a total of 1,543 6-mile hexes on the map. You’ve set aside somewhere between one-third (514 hexes) and one-half (771 hexes) of the hexes for your chaotic zone. That leaves 771 to 1,028 6-mile hexes that could potentially be part of a realm.

However, not all of those hexes will be part of the realm; deserts, forests, jungles, swamps, and similar inhospitable terrain won’t be settled (at least not by humans). Count or estimate the number of grassland, hill, river, and scrubland hexes outside of your chaotic hill, river, and scrub hexes – that’s the number of hexes in your realm. For a typical map on an **ACKS Regional Map** sheet, you’ll have about 350 to 600 6-mile hexes.

In the Borderlands sandbox, much of the territory on the map is taken up by the Lusaun Forest, Viaspen Forest, Viamir Marshes, Meniri Mountains, and Waste, with the result that only around 400 hexes are available as inhabited territory.
