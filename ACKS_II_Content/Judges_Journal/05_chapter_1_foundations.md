# Chapter 1: Foundations

*"Quis custodiet ipsos custodies?" - Juvenal, Roman poet, 2nd c. AD*

The great Juvenal asked: "Who watches the watchmen?" We ask: Who teaches the gamemasters how to gamemaster? Generally, the answer is "nobody." And that's a problem. We've long believed that one of the major obstacles impeding the spread of the tabletop hobby is the lack of good gamemasters (GMs). It's been our experience that most people who like games, given the chance, will participate in a tabletop RPG, and once they start participating, continue to enjoy it. But most people don't get to ever even try an RPG, simply because there is a worldwide shortage of gamemasters.

Thus, in Chapter 1 of the **Judges Journal**, we aim to lay the foundations you’ll need to serve as the gamemaster of an **ACKS** campaign. If you’re new to tabletop role-playing games, this part of the **Judges Journal** will be invaluable to you. It draws on four decades of experience running RPGs with lessons learned over thousands of sessions and condenses it down into digestible advice.

If you’re already an experienced gamemaster, you might be tempted to skip this part of the book. We hope you don’t! There are many styles of gamemastering, and if you’ve been doing this for decades, you doubtless have your own that works for you. However, not every style of gamemastery works well with every tabletop RPG. The advice and approach in the following chapters is specifically designed for running **ACKS**. You might agree with what you read, or you might disagree and do it another way. But you will at least have gained insight into why certain game design decisions were made and how we intended the game to be run, which will help you make the game your own.
