## Step 10: Review for Verisimilitude

Some *ACKS* Judges prefer to create dungeons where the ordinary laws of nature are suspended. Sometimes called “funhouses,” “gonzo dungeons,” or “mythic underworlds,” dungeons of this ilk simply ignore questions such as “what do the monsters eat,” “who resets the traps,” and “how did the creatures get here” in order to provide an unpredictable and flavorful play experience. Other *ACKS* Judges prefer to create naturalistic dungeons – desolate, ruined, occupied by monsters, but still governed by the laws of nature. Both approaches can work, but the second approach requires an additional step in the dungeon design process, a review for verisimilitude.

If you’re creating a gonzo dungeon where the extraordinary is everywhere, skip this step. If you’re creating a naturalistic dungeon, here are the questions you should ask yourself as you review it for verisimilitude:

* Why has the dungeon not already been explored by other adventurers?
* Why are the monsters in the dungeon?
* How did the monsters get into the dungeon?
* What do the monsters eat and drink and where do they excrete?
* Why is there treasure in the dungeon?
* If there are perishable items in any of the treasures, why haven’t they perished?
* Who, if anyone, re-sets the traps in the dungeon?

We’ll use ***AX1: Sinister Stone of Sakkara***as an example of a review for verisimilitude. In ***AX1****,* the dungeon has not already been explored because it has been sealed under a dome of rock for thousands of years, and has only recently become accessible due to an earthquake. Most of the monsters are in the dungeon because they have been draw their by the emanations of the eponymous Sinister Stone; others are undead that have been there for millennia, or abominations created by the stone. The newly-arrived monsters got into the dungeon via it’s only entrance, near the crack in the dome. The monsters frequently raid the surrounding forest and countryside for food and treasure. The treasures in the dungeon include perishable items only if they belong to the newly-arrived monsters, while the older and hidden treasures are non-perishable coin, gems, etc. The monstrous inhabitants of the dungeon re-set its traps.
