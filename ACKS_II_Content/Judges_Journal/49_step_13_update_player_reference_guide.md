## Step 13: Update Player Reference Guide

With your realms named and tabulated, it’s time to update your player reference guide to include the new information you’ve added. All that’s generally required is to include the name of whichever realm(s) the adventurers are likely to hail from or adventure within, with perhaps a sentence or two about them.

You can go into more detail if you wish, but many players won’t read it and the effort is often wasted. While this can be annoying to Judges that thrive on world-building, it’s wise to remember that in the real world most people cannot identify the location of major landmarks (“where is the Great Wall of China located?”) nor the chronology of historical events (“when did the War of 1812 take place?”), so having the adventurers be equally clueless about the game world is actually highly simulative.
