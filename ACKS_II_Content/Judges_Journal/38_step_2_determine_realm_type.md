## Step 2: Determine Realm Type

Consulting the Realms by Type table, we look for the type of realm that encompasses a region of 350 to 1,028 6-mile hexes. We see that Principalities are 280-1,050 hexes in size. Therefore the major realm in your sandbox is certainly a Principality. As such, it will be ruled by an 11th or 12th level Prince whose immediate vassals will be 9th – 10th level dukes. The Prince will reside in and rule from the sandbox’s capital city, which you placed near the middle of the lawful zone in Step 7(b)(ii) last chapter.

In the Auran Empire campaign setting, Principalities are referred to as “Prefectures.” The Borderlands is a Prefecture ruled by the 11th level Prefect Basilio from its capital city of Cyfaraun.
