Many of the names on this list will be familiar to those of you who have studied ancient history, military history, or classical literature, as either important primary sources or well-regarded secondary sources. One book will likely be unfamiliar: M*ighty Men,* long out of print, is a childrenâ€™s primer on ancient history filled with the heroic tales of ancient and medieval heroes. It was my own introduction to the worlds of antiquity and I commend it to any parent who wants a book that will instill a love of our epic past.
