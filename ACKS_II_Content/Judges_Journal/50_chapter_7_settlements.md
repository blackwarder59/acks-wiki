# Chapter 7: Settlements

By the time you’ve finished constructing the realm, you’ll have placed settlements at many locations on the map. In Step 7E of Chapter 5, you’ll have selected one of these settlements as your party’s starting point. We recommended either a stronghold close to your largest low-level dungeon, or your region’s largest city. Either way, the next step is to construct this settlement. (The details of the other settlements can be worked out later, when the need requires.)

The population, demand modifiers, and ruler of the starting city should have already been selected in previous steps, but now you must flesh these out into a description of the city.
