## Building a Spell

When building a spell, begin by choosing the spell’s type. Once the spell type is selected, consult the appropriate Spell Characteristics table, and choose (in order) the effect(s), target(s), duration, range, saving throw, and source of the spell. Each of these characteristics will have an associated spell point cost.

The spell’s cost in spell points is calculated as:

(Base cost of all effects) x (target factor) x (duration factor) x (range factor) x (saving throw factor) x (source factor)

Round the final value to the nearest whole number. Round .5 down if the preceding number is even, up if odd.

### Spells with More Spell Build Points

It is evident from even casual perusal of the ***ACKS II***spell lists that spells of the same level sometimes vary in power. The most powerful spells of any given spell level outshine their peers, and often equal or exceed the power of spells of greater levels. These spell power guidelines assume that the disparity in spell power has occurred because of magical experimentation. Over eons of magical research, pioneering spellcasters have occasionally achieved breakthroughs that created now-famous spells such as *fireball*.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Breakthrough** | **Spell Build Points** |
| Minor | +5 |
| Major | +10 |
| Revolutionary | +20 |

Spellcasters who research new spells using these guidelines can replicate mighty incantations as *fireball* by making breakthroughs through experimentation that provide additional spell build points. A minor breakthrough grants 5 additional spell build points. A major breakthrough grants 10 additional spell build points. A revolutionary breakthrough grants 20 additional spell build points.
