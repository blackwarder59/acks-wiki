## Baseline Assumptions

The economy of ***ACKS*** was built from a small number of assumptions, the most crucial of which are (1) that an unskilled laborer earns around 1sp per day of work; (2) that a typical farm yields one quarter of grain per acre; (3) that one quarter of grain sells for 4gp; and (4) that risky investments will yield a rate of return of 3% per month.

The first three assumptions are grounded in history, and a more elaborate explanation of them can be found later in this appendix. They set the foundation for the wages and costs of everything else in the setting. Mankind’s caloric needs and unskilled labor productivity did not vary much within the timeframe ***ACKS***concerns itself, and so by adjusting for land productivity we could normalize a variety of historical prices for the game.

The fourth assumption actually *emerged* from the other three assumptions of the system; it wasn’t initially designed in. We have previously referred to it as “the secret ratio” of 1:33 (as 1 divided by 33 yields 0.03 or 3%). The first place the secret ratio appeared was in the average rate of return on gold invested per month in certain mercantile activities, which was 3%. But then it started appearing everywhere.

This ratio became very useful as it allowed us to work out the approximate "capital" of individuals with known income, or conversely, the approximate income of individuals with a known amount of capital. (Note that capital is loosely defined here -- a fighter who has spent thousands of gold carousing while bragging of his exploits has essentially "invested" in his reputation. We assumed for the sake of simplicity that coin, equipment, training, carousing, etc. all have an equal rate of return). Using the secret ratio, we can conclude that:

* A peasant, earning 3gp per month, probably has (3x33) 99gp in capital. This is probably seed, farming implements, and perhaps some domestic animals. It is by happy coincidence also very close to the average starting wealth of a PC.
* An alchemist, earning 75gp per month, probably has (75x33) 2,475gp in capital — lab equipment, books, chemical mixtures, potions, and coin.
* The emperor of a massive domain, with an income of 360,000gp per month, has capital of around 11,880,000gp.
* A warrior (2nd level fighter) with 1,500gp invested in equipment, training, and so on, would expect to earn 45gp per month (1500/33).

About 80% of experience points in **ACKS** are derived from gold, so it was easy to determine the capital of an NPC by multiplying his XP by 80%. That in turn enabled us to calculate the amount of money the character would expect to earn per month. This solved the age-old problem of "how much does it cost to hire an NPC of such-and-such level”.

Even better, since we knew the average income of various ranks of nobility, it also showed how the wages of characters of various levels compared against that of nobility. At 9th level a character's income from his skills suggested he should be earning as much as an earl or count — which, in turn, suggests that a 9th level warlord who has built a stronghold and carved out a domain can safely style himself as an earl or count.

Some reviewers who have encountered the secret ratio find the notion of a 3% per month interest rate absurd. But it wasn’t absurd historically – in fact, it wasn’t even uncommon! In some times and places, it was the default. For example:

* The average 1-year rate of profit on agricultural product during the 13th-14th centuries in England was 22.3% for wheat, 29.3% for barley, and 22.4% for oats ("Markets and Economic Growth: The Grain Market of Medieval England", Greg Clark, Department of Economics - UC Davis).
* In Old Babylonia, the interest rate on agricultural loans was 33 1/3%. ("How Interest Rates Were Set, 2500 BC - 1000 AD," Michael Hudson, *Journal of the Economic and Social History of the Orient* 43, Spring 2000).
* Mortgage lenders in pre-modern France typically required interest of 20-30% of the value of their loan and merchants paid as much as 5-8 % interest per *week* for working capital (*An Essay on Economic Theory*, Richard Cantillon).
* The rate of return on the silver trade between Rome and India during the Hellenistic era was 100%! (*The Middle Ages Revisited*, Alexander Del Mar).

Such exorbitant rates of profit and interest seem unbelievable to students of modern economics. How could such rates of profit and interest be sustained? Because of all these factors:

* Economic rents on land. Landlords had a monopoly on land and legal rights to force the workers to work the land. Labor was not a free market.
* Economic rents on commerce. Guild monopolies were common, as were royal charters.
* Grossly inefficient markets. Inefficient markets allow for higher rates of return than efficient markets, which arbitrage away high profits.
* Very short time preferences. When life is nasty, brutish, and short, there’s little incentive to save. That means that interest rates must be very high or actors will simply consume.
* Low capital accumulation. Revenues were consumed rather than capitalized, leading to high rates of profit but low rates of long-term growth.

From these four assumptions we erected the edifice of ***ACKS***’s economic system. The rest of this article fills in various gaps in the system that might arise in play.
