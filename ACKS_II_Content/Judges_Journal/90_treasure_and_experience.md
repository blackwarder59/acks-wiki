## Treasure and Experience

An expedition gains experience for each encounter that they defeat. As normal, each player character in the expedition receives one share, while each henchman receives one-half share, of any realized experience. If the expedition is composed entirely of henchmen or other such hirelings, they still only receive half XP from combat. Troops in units receive 75 x (monster level / expedition level) XP from combat each.

If the encounter was against a monster lair, the monsters will have treasure. If you want, you can follow the standard rules for generating treasure, rolling on the treasure type table for the monsters to determine the amount of coin, gems, jewelry, and special treasure. Alternatively, you can simply assume that a lair has treasure with a gp value equal to four times the experience value of the lair.

### Magic Items

If the monsters have treasure, magic items might be present. You can follow the standard rules for generating magic items or simply consult the table below. For each full amount of the gold listed per roll, roll once on the listed treasure type for magical items. Disregard all other possible results of the treasure type; all coin, jewelry, gems, and so on are already included in the gp value of the treasure.

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Magical Items** | | |
| **Monster Level** | **GP Per Roll** | **Treasure Type** |
| 1 | 1000 | D |
| 2 | 1250 | E |
| 3 | 3250 | I |
| 4 | 6000 | L |
| 5 | 22000 | Q |
| 6 | 45000 | R |

EXAMPLE: An expedition has cleared a lair consisting of a Monster Level 4 encounter of challenge modifier -4. The encounter was worth 5,000 XP, meaning that the lair had 20,000 gp of treasure. Consulting the table for level 4, the Judge sees that he should roll for magic items in treasure type L once for each 6,000 full GP. In this case, that means three rolls of treasure type L. He does not roll for gems, jewelry, or coin.

### Allocating Treasure and XP

If the expedition is composed of a mix of PCs (or other similar employers) and henchmen, treasure is split as it normally would be, according to whatever share of treasure the henchmen are normally entitled to and whatever share of treasure military units would expect from spoils of war. XP is gained from realized treasure as normal in such a fashion.

If the expedition consists entirely of henchmen and followers, treasure is split as above, but the absent employer(s) and henchmen all receive a full share each. Treasure gained in this fashion for absent employers is considered a campaign activity, granting XP for that portion which exceeds the employerâ€™s GP threshold as normal.

EXAMPLE: An expedition has recovered 20,000gp of treasure. The expedition consists of the bladedancer Phaedra and her six henchmen. Treasure is split between [1 + (6/2)] = 4 shares. Each share is worth 20,000gp / 5 = 4,000gp. Therefore Phaedra earns 4,000gp and each henchman earns 2,000gp. If Phaedra were not present, treasure would be split between (1 + 6) = 7 shares. Phaedra and each of her six henchmen would earn 2,857gp.
