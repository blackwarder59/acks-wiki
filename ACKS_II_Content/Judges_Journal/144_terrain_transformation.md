## Terrain Transformation

Throughout human history, agricultural and pastoral activities have transformed the landscapes we live in. The timeline for such transformations is decades to centuries, and so such outcomes are irrelevant to most ***ACKS II***campaigns. However, some Judges enjoy running “dynastic” campaigns that do encompass scores or hundreds of years. Other Judges like to take such effects into account when building their campaign setting – laying down forests and swamps as they existed before human intervention and then mapping the action of mankind onto it.

Therefore we offer the following optional rules for the transformation of terrain over time. As shown on the Terrain Transformation table, as the population increases in a 6-mile hex, the type of terrain changes. In the game world, the various land improvements and agricultural investments made by the realm ruler, along with the activities of the population itself, cause this change. For instance, deserts are irrigated and cultivated; swamps are dredged; hills are terraced for easier farming; and forests are cut down or burned.

The transformation in the game world is obviously gradual but for mechanical purposes it occurs in the month when the new population threshold is reached. When the transformation occurs, the demand modifiers for any urban settlement in that hex might change; see p. XX for rules on how terrain effects demand modifiers.

Only human, halfling, and humanoid (beastman) families cause terrain transformation. Dwarven, gnomish, and elven families do not – or at least they transform the land differently. For instance, dwarves mining using the rules in ***By This Axe*** despoil the land, causing both terrain transformation as well as reduction in land value.

**Designer’s Note:** Judges who… luxuriate in detail… might of course, divide the 6-mile hex into 1.5-mile hexes, use population thresholds of 1-12, 13-20, and 21+ families per 1.5-mile hex, and apply the transformations proportionately. For the record Autarch is not suggesting you should do this. Just because you could do something with the rules doesn’t mean we expect you to!
