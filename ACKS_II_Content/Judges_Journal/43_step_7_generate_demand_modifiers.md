## Step 7: Generate Demand Modifiers

Now that you know the market class of all the strongholds and settlements in your sandbox, you can determine the demand modifiers for the various markets. If any of your players has rolled up a venturer or expressed interest in pursuing mercantile ventures, you should attend to this step before the first session of play. Otherwise, you can come back to this step once your players have begun to think about trade and commerce.

When generating demand modifiers, you can assign the demand modifiers for the markets at your discretion in order to reflect a desired pattern of trade routes and commerce for your setting, or you can randomly generate the demand modifiers using the following rules if you prefer procedural methods.

### A. Randomly Determine Base Demand Modifiers

Roll 1d3-1d3 for each type of merchandise, giving a range of -2 to +2 for the market.

### B. Apply Environmental Adjustments

Adjust the base demand modifiers for each type of merchandise based on the domain’s environment, including its age, water source (if any), climate, and elevation. Simply consult the **Environmental Adjustments to Demand** table, below, and apply all relevant modifiers for the market. (You can apply multiple modifiers from the Water Source and Biome/Climate segments where appropriate.) Drop any fractions remaining after all modifiers have been applied.

EXAMPLE: The Judge is designing a domain beyond the borders of Southern Argollë. The domain is located on a hilly section of sylvan woods (deciduous forest, hills) near the Mirmen River (river bank). It has never been settled before, so its age is 0. Beginning with Grain, he starts generating his new domain’s demand modifiers. He rolls 1d3-1d3 for Grain and gets a score of -1. This is then modified by an additional -1 (0 years old), -1 (river bank), and -1/2 (deciduous forest), for a total of -3 1/2. Dropping the fraction, he notes that his domain has a demand modifier of -3 for Grain. This process is repeated for each other type of merchandise.

### C. Apply Domain-specific Adjustments

As explained in ***ACKS II****,* each domain has land revenue of 3gp to 9gp, reflecting whether some lands are rich in farm produce, timber, furs, and other resources. Others have barren, infertile soil with limited natural resources. These factors will affect the demand modifiers of the domain’s market. Domains with limited resources have a higher demand for goods and must pay more for them.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Domain Land Revenue** | **Demand Modifiers** |
| 3gp | +1 Demand Modifier to 6 merchandise types, -1 Demand modifier to 1 merchandise type |
| 4gp | +1 Demand Modifier to 4 merchandise types, -1 Demand modifier to 1 merchandise type |
| 5gp | +1 Demand Modifier to 2 merchandise types, -1 Demand Modifier to 1 merchandise type |
| 6gp | +1 Demand Modifier to 1 merchandise type, -1 Demand modifier to 1 merchandise type |
| 7gp | -1 Demand Modifier to 2 merchandise types, +1 Demand Modifier to 1 merchandise type |
| 8gp | -1 Demand Modifier to 4 merchandise types, +1 Demand Modifier to 1 merchandise type |
| 9gp | -1 Demand Modifier to 6 merchandise types, +1 Demand Modifier to 1 merchandise type |

The specific types of merchandise affected can be determined randomly using the Random Merchandise table (see ***ACKS II Revised Rulebook*** p. XX)or selected to reflect the history and culture of the campaign setting. A domain in a pseudo-Chinese culture might have negative demand modifiers for porcelain and silk, but a positive demand modifier for mounts, while a domain in a pseudo-Viking culture might have a negative demand modifier for furs and fish, but a positive demand modifier for silk.

EXAMPLE: The new domain has land revenue of 8gp, so the Judge must roll for four negative demand modifiers and one positive Demand modifier. He decides to randomly generate the domain-specific adjustments, starting with the negative modifiers. Rolling on the Common Merchandise table, he rolls a 94, directing him to the Precious Merchandise table. He rolls a 39, so his domain has a -1 demand modifier on precious metals. The Judge decides that that there are gold mines in the hills nearby. He repeats this process for the other three negative and one positive demand modifiers.

### D. Apply Racial Adjustments

The demi-human races are noted for their production of certain merchandise, and their demand for others.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Race** | **Demand Modifiers** |
| Dwarf | -2 Demand Modifier to beer/ale, common metals, tools, armor/weapons, rare metals, semi-precious stones, and gems  +2 Demand Modifier to common wood, common furs, grain/vegetables, oils & sauces, rare furs, rare woods, and ivory |
| Elf | -2 Demand Modifier to botanicals, common wood, dyes/pigments, clothing, glassware, porcelain, textiles  +2 Demand Modifier to grain/vegetables, monster parts, rare books, salt, silk, semi-precious stones, and gems |

### E. Determine Trade Routes

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Market Class** | **Range of Trade (Road)** | **Range of Trade (Water)** |  |
| Class VI | 24 miles (4 hexes) | 48 miles (8 hexes) |  |
| Class V | 48 miles (8 hexes) | 96 miles (16 hexes) |  |
| Class IV | 72 miles (12 hexes) | 120 miles (20 hexes) |  |
| Class III | 96 miles (18 hexes) | 240 miles (40 hexes) |  |
| Class II | 144 miles (24 hexes) | 360 miles (60 hexes) |  |
| Class I | 168 miles (28 hexes) | 480 miles (80 hexes) |  |

Markets may enjoy a regular exchange of goods with other markets along a **trade route.** For a trade route to exist, two criteria must be met. First, the markets must be connected by a road, trail, or navigable waterway. Second, both markets must be within each other’s range of trade, as listed on the Range of Trade table.

EXAMPLE: A castle (Class VI) is located along a road 24 miles from a large town (Class IV) and 96 miles from a city (Class III). The large town and the city are 72 miles apart. A trade route exists between the castle and the large town, and between the large town and the city, but not between the castle and the city, as the 96 mile distance is greater than the castle’s range of trade.

When a trade route connects two markets, the smaller market has all of its demand modifiers shifted by 2 points closer to the larger market’s demand modifiers (or set equal to the larger market’s demand modifiers if separated by less than 2 points). If the two markets connected by the trade route are of equal size, each shifts each of its demand modifiers by 1 point closer to the other market’s demand modifiers.

When shifting demand modifiers for a region, start with the largest market and work outward to each its direct trade routes, starting with the largest settlement it trades with. Proceed from there to the next smallest, and so on. If two markets are of the same size, then start with the one that is closest. If equidistant, choose or roll randomly.

|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Demand**  **Modifier** | **Cyfaraun** | **Samos**  **(original)** | **Samos**  **(trade route)** |  |
| Wood, common | -3 | -2 | -3 |  |
| Hides, furs | -3 | -1 | -3 |  |
| Metals, common | -2 | -3 | -2 |  |
| Grain | +1 | -2 | 0 |  |
| Spices | +1 | 0 | +1 |  |
| Silk | +1 | 0 | +1 |  |

EXAMPLE: Cyfaraun, a Class IV city in Southern Argollë, and Samos, a Class V town down the road about 48 miles away, share a trade route. Cyfaraun will therefore shift all of Samos’s demand modifiers by 2 points closer to its own, as shown on the table below. The trade route has equalized much of the demand in the two markets.
