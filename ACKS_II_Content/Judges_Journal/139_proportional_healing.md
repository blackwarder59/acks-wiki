## Proportional Healing

Hit points are a measure of a character’s ability to survive in combat. Hit points are *not* a direct representation of the character’s capacity to receive physical injury. A character with 40 hp cannot survive eight sword stabs to the stomach! Rather, they represent a holistic combination of fighting skill, stamina, luck, and the favor of the gods, all of which contribute to helping the character roll with blows and survive attacks that would have killed a lesser combatant. Therefore, the amount of damage a weapon deals must be understood relative to the hit points of the character struck. It is the percentage of hit points lost, not the raw number lost, that indicates how physically wounded a character or monster is.

However, the elegant abstraction of hit points is marred by an asymmetry between damage and healing. Consider two characters, a normal man with 5 hp and an epic hero with 40 hp. When the normal man is dealt 4 points of damage by a sword, this is a grievous blow (80% of his hit points); when the epic hero is dealt the same 4 points of damage, this is merely a flesh wound (10% of his hp). This is exactly as it should be. Yet when the epic hero is treated with *cure light injury*, he recovers 1d6+1 points of damage – enough to repair a light wound, as the spell suggests; while when the normal man is treated with *cure light injury*, he is likely to recover from what we just said was a grievous blow that brought him near death. To fix this asymmetry, you can use these optional rules for proportional healing.

### Base Healing Rate

All beings recover hit points through rest. For each full day of dedicated rest in reasonably sanitary conditions, a creature will recover its **base healing rate (BHR)**. If its rest is interrupted, the creature will not heal that day. A creature’s base healing rate is based on its maximum hit points, as shown on the Base Healing Rate table. A character’s BHR should be recorded on its character sheet, and updated each time the character gains additional hit points.

EXAMPLE: Athelstan has 12 hp. His base healing rate is 1d4 hp per day. With a full day of complete rest in sanitary conditions, Athelstan will recover between 1 and 4 hp. If his rest is interrupted, he will not heal.

| --- | --- |
| **Max HP** | **BHR (hp/day)** |
| 1-3 | 1d2 |
| 4-9 | 1d3 |
| 10-16 | 1d4 |
| 17-23 | 1d6 |
| 24-29 | 1d8 |
| 30-36 | 1d10 |
| 37-49 | 2d6 |
| 50-63 | 2d8 |
| 64-76 | 2d10 |
| 77-89 | 2d12 |
| 90-110 | 3d10 |
| 111-140 | 4d10 |
| 141-170 | 5d10 |
| 171+ | 6d10, plus 1d10  per 30hp past 170 |

Characters with the Healing proficiency can shorten their patient’s recovery time. A patient under treatment of Healing recovers twice his base healing rate in hp each day of rest, or his base healing rate without rest.

EXAMPLE: If Athelstan were the patient of a character with Healing proficiency, he would recover twice his base healing rate of 1d4 hp per day of rest, i.e. 2d4 hp per day of rest.

Healing also occurs through magic, such as potions or spells. This kind of healing is instantaneous and will typically be equal to one or more days of rest, as shown on the Magical Healing table. Magical healing and natural healing can be combined.

EXAMPLE: Athelstan (with 12 hp and a base healing rate of 1d4 hp) has sustained 9 points of damage, leaving him with 3 hp. A cleric treats him with comfrey. Comfrey heals its target by half as much as if he had rested for one day, rounded up. Athelstan’s base healing rate is 1d4 hp per day, so he will heal 1d4/2 hp. The result of the roll is a 3, so Athelstan is healed (3 / 2) 1.5 hp, rounded up to 2 hp. The cleric then casts *cure moderate injury*on Athelstan. *Cure moderate injury* heals its target as if he had rested for two days, so Athelstan will heal 2d4 hp. The result of the roll is a 5, so Athelstan is healed 5 points. He now has 10 hp of his maximum of 12.

| **Spell** | **Effect\*** |
| *Salving Rest* | The target’s base healing rate is doubled for non-magical healing, or tripled if under care of a healer. |
| *Cure Light Injury* | The target is healed as if he had rested for one day. |
| *Cure Moderate Injury* | The target is healed as if he had rested for two days. |
| *Cure Major Injury* | The target is healed as if he had rested for three days. |
| *Cure Serious Injury* | The target is healed as if he had rested for four days. |
| *Cure Critical Injury* | The target is healed as if he had rested for five days. |
| *Spirit of Healing* | Each round, the target is healed as if he had rested for one day. |
| *Lay on Hands* | The target is healed as if he had rested for one day per two levels of the healer (rounded up). |
| *Comfrey* | The target is healed by half as much as if he had rested for one day (rounded up). |
| \*These effects occur instead of the spell’s effect under the ***ACKS II***core rules. Reversed healing spells deal necrotic damage qual to what they would have healed. | |

**Heroic Breakfast Memorial Rule (Optional):** Once per day a character can recover his base healing rate in hp by consuming a meal accompanied by alcohol, coffee, or tea. This recovery is in addition to any hit points gained from complete rest. Halfling characters can consume a second breakfast for an additional recovery of hp.
