## Elven Custom Classes

The elves claim to be the first born children of the Empyrean gods. As evidence of their elder status, they point to early elven settlements in the Pillars of Dawn and the forests of Argollë, closest to the rising sun of Ammonar. It is unquestioned that elven civilization was at an advanced state well before human civilization had progressed past tribal bands. From 3,500 B.E. to 1,650 B.E., the elves expanded to every shore of the Ammas Aurë, establishing the longest-lasting empire yet to dominate Aurëpos. The Argollëan Empire was eventually destroyed in a terrible cataclysm known to historians as the Fall.

Few facts are confirmed about the Fall, and all elven records from that time period have been lost or destroyed. The Temple of the Winged Sun teaches that The Fall came about from hubris: The elves aspired to be like the Empyreans, and emulated them in creating life. It is taught that from these works came the terrible *things* that later corrupted Zahar. The elves, of course, deny this. Whatever the truth of the Fall, afterwards the elves were a scattered and ruined people, and the now-extinct Thrassian race claimed their lands.

Today only a single elven kingdom survives, in Northern Argollë, though scattered fastnesses can still be found in forests throughout Aurëpos. Elves that hail from Northern Argollë style themselves *high elves*, and count themselves as the inheritors of their race’s ancient glories. Elves from the outlying fastnesses call themselves *wood elves*. While less cultured than high elves, wood elves yet retain something of the martial vigor of the elves of old.

Elven character classes are created using the elven racial category and experience points. Requirements, class category values, hit points per level after 9th, and experience point progressions are modified as noted below. There are no mechanical differences between “high” and “wood” elves, but different classes may be appropriate.

### Requirements

All elven classes require a minimum Intellect 9 or better.

### Class Category Values

**Fighting:** Elves with narrow or broad weapon selections *must* include at least two bows, crossbows, swords, or daggers among their selections.

**Arcane:** Any build points allocated to the Arcane Value stack with build points allocated to the Elf value for purposes of determining the class’s spellcasting ability (see below). Because of their innate magical power, the XP Cost for the Arcane Value is reduced by 125XP for elven classes.

EXAMPLE: The standard elven spellsword is built with Hit Dice 1, Fighting Value 2, Arcane Value 1, Elf Value 3. The XP cost for level 2 is 500 + 1,000 + (625-125) + 2000, for a total of 4,000XP.

### Elf Value

When building an elven custom class, assign between 0 and 4 build points to the class’s Elf Value. At Elf 0, all elves gain the following four elven custom powers:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Value** | **Elf** | **XP Cost** |
| 4 | Elf + 100% Arcane | 2500 |
| 3 | Elf + 66% Arcane | 2000 |
| 2 | Elf + 50% Arcane | 1375 |
| 1 | Elf + 33% Arcane | 750 |
| 0 | Elf | 125 |

* **Animal Friendship:** Whenever elves build fastnesses, all ordinary animals within 5 miles of the stronghold become kind and helpful to the elves.
* **Attunement to Nature:** Elves gain a +1 bonus to surprise rolls when in the wilderness. When using the Adventuring proficiency to search or listen, they succeed on a proficiency throw of 14+ (instead of the usual 18+). If separately proficient in Searching they gain a +2 bonus to their throw instead. If separately proficient in Listening, they gain a +4 bonus to their throw instead.
* **Connection to Nature:** All elves are immune to diseases caused by undead, and gain a +1 bonus on saving throws versus Petrification/Paralysis and Spells. Their robust vitality grants a +1 bonus to their HD roll at 1st level.
* **Elf Tongues:** All elves speak four bonus languages: Elf, Gnoll, Hobgoblin, and Orc.

Additional points allocated to the Elf Value stack with points allocated to the Arcane Value for purposes of spellcasting, magical research, strongholds, and magic item usability. Add the two values to find the class’s effective spellcasting abilities. For values of 5 or greater, use the following mechanics:

**Arcane + Elf 5:** The class has the ability to cast spells and engage in magical research as a mage, with the class’s spells per level increased by 33%. The class uses its class level for all level-dependent spell ranges, durations, and damages; these are not increased.

**Arcane + Elf 6:** As above, but the class’s spells per level are increased by 50%.

**Arcane + Elf 7:** As above, but the class’s spells per level are increased by 66%.

**Arcane + Elf 8:** As above, but the class’s spells per level are increased by 100%.

When calculating number of spells available, round fractions of 1/2 or more up; round any smaller fractions down.

EXAMPLE: An elven custom class has Arcane 3 and Elf 3. Adding the values together yields 6. The custom class has the spellcasting abilities of a mage with a spell progression with 50% more spells. A 3rd level mage has 2 1st and 1 2nd level spells; when this custom class is 3rd level, it will have (2 x 1.5 = 3) 3 1st level spells and (1 x 1.5 =1.5, rounded up to 2) 2 2nd level spell.

All elven spellcasters can cast spells wearing whatever armor they are permitted to use.

### Experience Point Progression After 8th level

Elves increase the amount of experience required to gain each level after 8th by 50,000XP.
