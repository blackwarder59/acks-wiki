## Step 1. Determine Settlement Size and Shape

The first step in constructing a settlement is to gauge how large it is. Pre-modern cities have typically had population densities ranging from around 50 to around 300 people per acre (10 to 60 *ACKS* families per acre). Larger cities tended to be more densely populated, with metropolises such as Alexandria and Rome having 500,000 and 1,000,000 people spread over 2,040 and 3,200 acres, yielding population densities of 245 and 311 people per acre respectively. On the other hand, a rich coastal city like Pompei had just 12,000 people over 160 acres, yielding a population density of only 75 people per acre. Regardless of their density, however, all of the cities tended to be constructed in one of three basic shapes:

* Circular/Radial: Built around a central point, such as a major temple or citadel.
* Linear: Built around central axis, such as a river, coast, or major road.
* Rectangular/Oval: Built around a grid of streets forming blocks.

**Designer’s Note:** The book ***Fractal Cities*** by Michael Batty and Paul Longley is an excellent source of insight and illustration into the size, shape, and development of cities.

The Settlement Size table below shows the expected families per acre, acres, and square footage for each type of settlement. Square footage is then used to suggest dimensions for settlements of different shapes. These are merely examples and not prescriptions – any given settlement could be less or more densely populated than the averages shown here.

To spare you the effort of taking out your ruler and measuring, the city of Cyfaraun has a population of 2,550 families spread over 83 acres. The city walls enclose an area approximately 2,400’ long and 1,600’ wide. Here at Autarch, we eat our own dogfood!
