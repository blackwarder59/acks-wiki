## Step 10: Assign Troops Garrisons

Now it’s time to calculate the garrison the sandbox. Since you already know the population of each domain and the domain classification of all its territory, this is a simple process. For the personal domains of the Prince, Dukes, and Counts, follow these steps:

* Assign each civilized domain a garrison worth at least 2gp per family.
* Assign each borderlands domain a garrison worth at least 3gp per family.
* Assign each outlands domain a garrison worth at least 4gp per family.

There are other troops that you need to account for, however – the troops that garrison the various Baronies and Viscounties that lie within the borders of the Counties. For these, you can calculate the size of their domains by subtracting the population of the Count’s personal domain from the Count’s County. Then assign gp per family according to the rations above. These garrisons will be available to your Counts when they issue Call to Arms duties.

You can now allocate the garrison gp towards troops appropriate to your sandbox. (It’s not strictly necessary at this time but if you don’t be sure to write down all these values for later use.) If you’re the sort who enjoys building armies in wargames, break out your favorite spreadsheet and play with different ratios of troops. Try to get within 1-2% of the garrison expense. (You’ll hardly ever be able to get an exact match.).

Here’s how we did for the Borderlands. Since the area is supposed to be an important bulwark against the Waste, we assigned a garrison of 2gp for every urban family; 3gp per peasant family in Cyfaraun; and 4gp per peasant family for every other ruler. That results in the following;

* The Prefect, with 7,500 peasant families and 2,550 urban families, has a garrison of 27,600gp.
* Each Palatine, with around 1,250 peasant families and 550 urban families, has a garrison of 6,100gp.
* Each Legate, with around 725 peasant families and 110 urban families, has a garrison of 3,120gp.
* Each Legate’s Legature has around 3,825 families, of which 725 are the Legate’s personal domain and the other 3,100 are peasant families. That means that the Legates can call on another 12,400gp worth of troops, for a total of 3,120 + 12,400 = 15,320gp.
* Since there are 5 Legatures in each Palatinate, each Palatine can call on a total of [6,100gp + (5 x 15,320gp)] = 82,710gp. With 4 Palatinates in the Prefecture, the Prefect can call on a total of [27,600gp + (4 x 82,710gp) 358,440gp.

The table below reveals how we turned these numbers into the army presented in ***AX3: Capital of the Borderlands***.

Note that the number of troops adds up by the ratio of the Legatures to Palatinates to Prefectures. For instance, with 15 cataphract cavalry per Palatinate, 5 Legatures per Palatinate, and 30 cataphract cavalry per Legature, each Palatinate has [15 + (5 x 30)] = 165 cataphracts. Note also that the number of veterans (3,535) is around 25% of the total number of troops (13,990).

**Designer’s Note:** Remember that the garrison costs represents the minimum garrison required to keep the peace in domains without morale problems. A domain might have many more troops if it is engaged in war or strategically important. For instance, to secure the border against the forces of chaos reliably over the decades, the Auran Empire used to supplement the Borderland’s garrisons with troops from the heartland of the Empire. Those troops are gone now fighting the Skysos, which conveniently allowed us to present a realm with the rules-appropriate number of troops!
