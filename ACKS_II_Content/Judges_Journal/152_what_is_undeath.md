## What is Undeath?

The Lawful gods believe that undeath is a corruption of the natural order that the Lawful gods are relying on to achieve their version of the Rebirth. Undeath blocks the natural process of reincarnation from occurring. Lawful societies are taught to prevent undeath from occurring, and to destroy it wherever it arises.

The Chaotic gods believe that undeath is an overcoming of flesh and a victory over death. It is the ultimate exercise of the will to power, when a soul refuses to obey even Natureâ€™s Laws. Chaotic societies see undeath as the best means by which an individual soul can avoid melting away after death.

Undeath can arise from corrupting the natural order of either the body (form) or the soul, and the disruption can be spread from tainted creature to creature.

When the body of a living creature is corrupted, the soul within is trapped in the corrupted body upon its death. Ghouls, mummies, and vampires are examples of undead with corrupted bodies. Corrupted bodies are no longer truly alive and in the absence of magic or physical means of preservation, they rot. Ghouls magically maintain their bodies by feeding on the flesh of the living, vampires by feeding on their blood. Mummies do not feed, so great care is made to physically and magically preserve the body before undeath.

When the soul of a living creature becomes corrupted by undeath, the condition of the body is less important; the soul itself is unable to enter the cycle of reincarnation. Wights, wraiths, spectres, and vampires all have corrupted souls. Undead with corrupted souls are greatly feared, for they feed on the life-energy of living things, and whatever they drain away is filled by corruption. This is the basis for the much-feared enervation of such undead.

Based on the existence of incorporeal undead, the Chaotic gods believe that so-called exalted souls are simply incorporeal undead who have learned to feed on life energy given in worship. A Lawful priest claims that a deified emperor is worshipped because he is divine; a Chaotic cultist claims that a deified emperor is kept in a state of incorporeal undeath by worship. (The Chaotic cultists think this a good thing, of course, while their Lawful counterparts claim it as heresy and blasphemy.)

Since the world itself is the Logos or Cosmarch made immanent, it is possible for entire regions of the world to be as corrupted as an individual body by undeath. Such areas are known as **sinkholes of evil***.* In such sinkholes, the corruption may leak into corpses within, causing them to animate as skeletons and zombies. Similarly, magical animation of the dead functions by extracting tainted shards of the Logos from the environment and imbuing it into corpses. Skeletons and zombies are insentient, then, because the traces of Logos which animate them are not the soul of their original inhabitants but rather spiritual slag in nearby matter.

Places of death tend to become sinkholes of evil when the spiritual residue in corpses lingers in the environment and spreads back into the decaying corpses. By cremating the dead, the Empyrean faith keeps its places of dead clear of such pollution.
