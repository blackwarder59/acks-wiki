## Vagaries

History abounds with dramatic events brought about by unlikeliest of circumstances. The vagaries of fate can bring ruin to the proud, horror to the careful, and glory to the lucky. Here we present a variety of random tables designed to bring the chaos and confusion of history to your ***ACKS***campaigns.

Specific rules for using the vagaries tables are presented separately for each table. As a general rule, whenever a vagary result is implausible or irrelevant, you should re-roll, alter the event to make it plausible, or treat it as a “no vagary” result, as you deem most appropriate to the circumstances.

The use of these tables is strictly optional. The increase in variety and interest comes at a cost in extra bookkeeping and added complexity.

Periodically, domains may suffer incursions from wandering monsters, known as **domain encounters**.Wilderness domains face the most danger from domain encounters, while civilized domains face little risk.

#### Daily Chance

The Daily Domain Encounter Probability by Territory Size and Classificationtable shows the likelihood each day for a domain encounter. Cross-reference the size of the domain’s territory against the classification of the domain’s territory to determine the percentage chance.

EXAMPLE #1: A 24-mile hex is classified outlands territory. If the entire hex were one domain of 16 6-mile hexes, it would have a 44% chance each day of a domain encounter.

EXAMPLE #2: A 24-mile outlands hex is divided between 4 domains, ruled by Andor, Balbus, Cerwyn, and Decimus. Andor’s domain has a territory of 8 hexes; Balbus, 5 hexes; Cerwyn, 2 hexes; and Decimus, 1 hex. Andor’s domain has a 20% chance each day of a domain encounter; Balbus’s domain has a 15% chance; Cerwyn’s domain has a 5% chance; Decimus’s domain has a 3% chance. Note that the expected encounters per day in the entire hex (0.44) is virtually the same as the expected encounters per day in the individual domains: 0.20 (Andor) + 0.15 (Balbus) + 0.05 (Cerwyn) + 0.03 (Decimus), or 0.43.

| 2 hexes | 4d8 x 10 | 2d6 x 10 | 5d6 | 3d6 |
| 3 hexes | 2d8 x 10 | 2d4 x 10 | 3d6 | 2d6 |
| 4-6 hexes | 2d4 x 10 | 6d8 | 2d6 | 2d4 |

| 14-16 hexes | 5d6 | 2d8 | 1d3 | 1d2 |
| \*Used for dungeons in unsettled territory or under-garrisoned outlands | | | | |

#### Periodic Frequency

Rather than make an encounter throw every game day, you can instead assume that encounters regularly occur at a periodic frequency based on the domain territory’s size and classification. To determine the length of time (in days) between encounters, consult the Periodic Domain Encounter Frequencyby Territory Size and Classificationtable and cross-reference the domain’s territory size and classification.

EXAMPLE #1: A 10-hex civilized domain will have a domain encounter every 6d8 days, averaging 27 days between encounters.

EXAMPLE #2: Decimus’s 1-hex outlands domain will have a domain encounter every 6d10 days, averaging 33 days between encounters.

#### Dangerous Borders

Isolated domains face more wandering encounters than those with neighbors. If there’s only one little village around, that’s the village the orcs will raid. A similar problem occurs to border forts and frontier towns. It does less good to be adjacent to large, civilized domains if civilization is *behind* you. Therefore, a domain adjacent to one or more hexes of unsettled territory counts as having a larger territory for purposes of encounter throws.

|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Effective Domain Territory with Dangerous Borders** | | | | |
| **Domain Territory** | **Isolated** | **Spearhead** | **Flank** | **Line** |
| 1 hex | 16 hexes | 8 hexes | 6 hexes | 4 hexes |
| 2 hexes | 16 hexes | 10 hexes | 7 hexes | 4 hexes |
| 3 hexes | 16 hexes | 12 hexes | 9 hexes | 5 hexes |
| 4-6 hexes | 16 hexes | 14 hexes | 10 hexes | 6 hexes |
| 7-8 hexes | 16 hexes | 16 hexes | 12 hexes | 8 hexes |
| 9-10 hexes | 16 hexes | 16 hexes | 14 hexes | 9 hexes |
| 11-13 hexes | 16 hexes | 16 hexes | 16 hexes | 10 hexes |
| 14-16 hexes | 16 hexes | 16 hexes | 16 hexes | 11 hexes |

![](data:image/png;base64...)The accompanying illustration shows four possible territorial configurations of dangerous borders. In each configuration, the territory of the domain is represented with a tower icon; the territory secured by neighboring domains or impassable terrain is light grey; and the unsettled territory is dark grey. The **isolated** domain is surrounded by unsettled territory on all sides. In the **spearhead** configuration, the domain has unsettled territory to its front and flanks, and secure territory to its rear. In the **flank** configuration, the domain has unsettled territory to its front and one flank, and secure territory to its other flank and rear. Finally, in the **line** configuration, the domain has unsettled territory to its front, but its flanks and rear are secured by neighbors or terrain.

You should use this illustration and your own judgment of the regional geography to assess if an adventurer or NPC’s domain has dangerous borders, and if so whether it should be considered to be in an **isolated**, **spearhead**, **flank,** or **line** position. You should then consult the adjoining *Effective Domain Territory with Dangerous Borders* table, cross-referencing the domain’s territory size with its configuration to determine its effective territory size for encounter throws.

These rules make the location of a domain a decision of great long-term importance! A domain with a broad river, impassable cliffs or sturdy neighbors is far easier to defend.

EXAMPLE: Decimus’ outlands domain (1 6-mile hex) has land secure and settled to its rear, while its flanks and front are unsettled wilderness. It is in spearhead configuration. Cross-referencing the “1 hex” row with the “Spearhead” column, the Judge finds that Decimus’s domain has an effective territory of 8 6-mile hexes. Therefore, his domain has a 20% chance per day of a domain encounter or one encounter per 2d4 days.

#### Effect of Strongholds and Garrisons on Domain Encounters

By default, the rules assume that each domain is secured by a stronghold and garrison of sufficient size. If a civilized or borderlands domain has an insufficient garrison and/or stronghold, it is treated as if it were one classification worse for purposes of domain encounters. (E.g. a civilized domain is treated as a borderlands domain, while an outlands domain is treated as an unsettled wilderness).

EXAMPLE: Decimus goes bankrupt due to the machinations of the thieves’ guild, and can no longer pay his garrison. His domain is now treated as if it were unsettled wilderness. His domain has a 30% chance per day of a domain encounter or one encounter per 1d6 days.

#### Effect of Dungeons on Domain Encounters

If a territory includes one or more unoccupied or partly occupied dungeons, any domain encounters that occur might lead to monsters deciding to permanently settle there. If the dungeon is in a civilized, borderlands, or outlands domain, determine the probability or frequency of domain encounters using the rules above. If the dungeon is in unsettled territory, determine the probability or frequency of domain encounters as if it were in a 16-hex unsettled territory.

Attracting monsters into a dungeon is useful for arcane experimentation, but peasants do not enjoy living near monsters. To determine the morale impact of a dungeon on nearby domains, total the experience point value of the monsters in the dungeon and divide that total by the number of families in the domain’s territory (round to the nearest whole number). The quotient represents the penalty to the domain’s base morale.

EXAMPLE: Quintus’ domain has 1,100 peasant families. It also is home to a sinister dungeon with a cyclops (2,400 XP), 6 ogres (1,290 XP), and 60 orcs (600 XP), for 4,290 XP total. 4,290 XP / 1,100 families is 3.9, rounded to 4, so Quintus’ domain suffers a -4 penalty to its domain morale.

If a domain suffers a morale penalty from monsters in its dungeon(s), then any domains neighboring the dungeon’s domain treat the territory as being unsettled land for purposes of dangerous borders. This represents the risk of monsters wandering fromthe dungeon into their lands.

EXAMPLE: Quintus’s domain is on the southwestern flank of a long line of Auran strongholds. To the northeast is the fort of Türos Drav. Normally, Türos Drav would be in a line configuration, but since Quintus’s domain has a morale penalty from monsters, it counts as unsecured wilderness. Türos Drav therefore is treated as in a flank configuration.

#### Resolving Domain Encounters

Not every wandering monster enters a domain with intent to raid and pillage. Some may be exploring, migrating, or trading, while even those with violent intent may retreat if they do not find any weak prey or undefended villages. Conversely, not every violent encounter requires the domain’s ruler to sally forth. A typical domain’s garrison is more than capable of dealing with incursions by wolves, kobolds, or owlbeasts. That’s what garrisons are for!

When a domain encounter throw results in an encounter, the following steps should be followed:

* 1. Roll 1d20 on the Monster Rarity by Territory Classification table and consult the resulting sub-table for the terrain type.
  2. Roll 1d20 on the appropriate Monster Encounter by Terrain Type and Rarity to find the type of creature encountered.
  3. Find the encountered creature’s entry in the ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual***and roll against its **Lair** characteristic to determine whether the creature is **lingering** or **migrating** (explained below).
  4. Roll the appropriate **number encountered** for the creature to determine how many are present.

**Lingering or Migrating:** Wandering monsters are, by definition, not encountered in their lair. However, they may decide to make a lair in the domain.Any wandering monsters that arrive have a percentage chance of lingering in the domain equal to their Lair characteristic. Monsters are twice as likely to linger if treasure is available in an unoccupied or partly-occupied dungeon (see **Populating a Dungeon**in the***ACKS II Revised Rulebook****,* p. XX). Otherwise, the monsters are migrating. Whether the monsters are migrating or lingering changes how the monsters behave (see below).

**Number Encountered:** If the monster is migrating, use the number encountered for a wandering wilderness encounter. If the monster is lingering, roll 1d100 again against its **Lair** characteristic. If the result is again equal to or less than its Lair characteristic, use the number encountered for a wilderness lair. Otherwise, use the number encountered for a wandering wilderness encounter.

**Treasure Type:** Monsters entering a domain do not normally have any treasure of their own. However, if the monsters are a full wilderness lair, or arriving for mercantilist purposes (see below), they will have treasure according to their treasure type.

#### Reconnaissance Rolls for Domain Encounters

When a domain encounter occurs, you should make a reconnaissance rollfor the domain ruler as well as the monsters to determine what intelligence they have about each other. For purposes of reconnaissance, assume the garrison is in the domain’s stronghold if the ruler has not made other arrangements. You should use your judgment to determine the initial location of the wandering monsters based on the geography, roads, strongholds, and settlements in the region. See **Reconnaissance and Intelligence**in the***ACKS II Revised Rulebook****,* p. XX.

It is possible that a domain ruler may not be aware of a domain encounter until the enemy begins pillaging his domain or arrives at his stronghold! Given sufficiently poor reconnaissance, it is even possible for monsters to settle into a domain and impose morale penalties while an oblivious ruler remains unaware of the cause of the problem.

#### Reaction Rolls for Domain Encounters

When a domain encounter occurs, a reaction roll should be made to determine the attitude of the monsters. Roll 2d6, apply any relevant adjustments to the roll, and consult the Domain Encounter Reaction table below. Note that the rulers of the domain do not apply their CHA or proficiency adjustments and do notknow the reaction result until they discover it in play.

**Hostile** means that the monsters have come to wreak havoc. If the domain’s garrison is deployed against them, they will always fight. If the garrison remains in the stronghold, the monsters will assault or besiege the domain’s stronghold if (a) their BR is more than twice that of the garrison and (b) they possess the intelligence and means to do so. If the domain is conquered, the monsters will immediately begin pillaging the domain. If the domain is not conquered, the monsters will immediately begin looting supplies.

If the monsters are lingering, they will remain in the domain until defeated or until they have looted or pillaged it completely. (If a dungeon is available, they will lair therein.) If the monsters are migrating, they will depart after looting or pillaging the domain once. Allowing a domain to be pillaged has disastrous consequences on its population, stronghold value, and domain morale – see **Pillaging Domains**in the***ACKS II Revised Rulebook****,* p. XX. If the monsters settle in the domain, it may affect the domain’s base morale score (see above).

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Domain Encounter Reaction** | |
| **Adjusted Die Roll** | **Sapient** |
| 2- | Hostile, pillage |
| 3-5 | Unfriendly, opportunistic |
| 6-8 | Neutral, exploratory |
| 9-11 | Mercantilist , trade |
| 12+ | Friendly, help |

**Unfriendly** means that the monsters intend violence, but can be deterred. If the domain’s garrison is deployed against them, they will only fight if their BR equals or exceeds that of the garrison; otherwise they will be driven off (either out of the hex or, if lingering, into an available dungeon). If the domain is conquered, the monsters will immediately begin pillaging the domain. If the domain is not conquered, the monsters will immediately begin looting supplies. If the monsters are lingering, they will continue looting and/or pillaging until driven off or defeated, or until they have looted or pillaged it completely. If a dungeon is available, they will then lair therein. If the monsters are migrating, they will depart after looting or pillaging the domain once.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Circumstances** | **Morale Roll Adjustment** |
| Domain’s current morale score | + current morale score |
| Lawful domain encountering lawful monsters | +2 |
| Lawful or neutral domain encountering chaotic monsters | -2\* |
| Chaotic domain encountering lawful monsters | -2\* |
| \*Doubled if monsters’ BR is greater than garrison’s BR. | |

**Neutral** means that the monsters are migrating through the domain for reasons of their own – exploration, scouting, hunting, foraging, etc. If the domain’s garrison is deployed against them, they will become **unfriendly** (as above). If the domain’s garrison is not deployed against them, they will attempt to either find a place to settle (if lingering) or exit peacefully after 1d4 weeks (if migrating). Peasants tend to be xenophobic and distrustful, so if the domain ruler does not deploy the garrison against the monsters, the domain suffers a -1 penalty to its next domain morale roll. If the monsters settle in the domain, it may affect the domain’s base morale score (see above). Re-roll settled neutral monster’s reactions if the domain’s morale score changes.

**Mercantilist** means that the monsters have come with commercial motivations. If the domain’s garrison is deployed against them, they will become **unfriendly** (as above). Otherwise they will travel towards the domain’s urban settlement or stronghold to seek out opportunities for trade. Mercantilist monsters will carry treasure according to their treasure type; you can substitute an equivalent value of merchandise for trade if desired. Mercantilist monsters without treasure might, at your discretion, be offering mercenary services.

**Friendly** means that the monsters actively wish to assist the domain. If the domain’s garrison is deployed against them, they will become **unfriendly** (as above). Otherwise they will travel towards the domain’s urban settlement or stronghold to offer their assistance. If the domain has been invaded by monsters or enemy troops, the friendly monsters may attack the invaders and/or assist the garrison in dealing with them. Friendly monsters can be offered positions as mercenaries or henchmen with a +2 bonus (see below).

**Encounters between Monsters and Adventurers:** The reactions of monsters to individual adventurers that they interact with should be handled with individual reaction rolls as per the ***ACKS II Revised Rulebook****,* p. XX. However, apply a -2 penalty if the monsters are hostile to the domain, a -1 penalty if unfriendly, a +1 bonus if mercantilist, and a +2 bonus if friendly. If the character interacting with the monster is a ruler, senator, or magistrate of the domain, he can attempt to influence the monster’s reaction towards the domain.

**Encounters with Animals:** Encounters with monsters of animal intelligence are limited to results of Neutral or below unless the domain is an elven fastness. Pillaging by animals represents attacks on livestock, carrying off of young, etc.

**Encounters with Mindless Monsters:** Encounters with mindless monsters such as constructs and oozes are limited to results of Neutral or below. Pillaging by mindless monsters represents instinctual or programmed activities.

**Pillaging by Monsters:** The rules for pillaging in the ***ACKS II Revised Rulebook***assume pillaging by large numbers of men. Powerful monsters can pillage with much greater effectiveness. Large monsters (excluding cavalry) count as 2 troops for pillaging purposes; huge monsters count as 6 troops; gigantic monsters count as 24 troops; and colossal monsters count as 120 troops.

#### Military Campaigns for Domain Encounters

The arrival of hostile or unfriendly wandering monsters or the deployment of a garrison normally begins a military campaign. However, most domain encounters do not need to be handled using those detailed mechanics. Typically, the BR of wandering monsters is considerably less than the BR of the garrison, and the monsters will be quickly driven off.

When the threat posed by the monsters is interesting, you can run the domain encounter as a military campaign. In this case, hostile monsters have a strategic stance of *offensive,* while unfriendly monsters have a strategic stance of either *offensive* (if their BR exceeds that of the garrison) or *evasive* (if attempting to retreat).

#### Mass Combat for Domain Encounters

We recommend that you use the mass combat mechanics presented in the ***ACKS II Revised Rulebook***to resolve violent domain encounters. These mechanics allow for the garrison to confront the monsters without the adventurers, while still affording the opportunity for adventurers to influence the outcome through heroic forays.

If you have decided to run the military campaign in detail, the results of that campaign will determine where, how, and when the garrison confronts the wandering monsters. Otherwise, combat between domain garrisons and wandering monsters occurs as follows:

1. Hostile monsters facing a garrison in its stronghold **assault** the stronghold if the monster’s BR is more than twice that of the garrison and they possess the intelligence and means to do so. (Otherwise they simply pillage the domain.)
2. Hostile monsters facing a deployed garrison always fight a **pitched battle** against the garrison.
3. Unfriendly monsters facing a deployed garrison fight a **pitched battle** against the garrison if the monster’s BR is equal to or greater than that of the garrison. (Otherwise they are driven off.)
4. A garrison pursuing monsters into a dungeon **assaults**the dungeon.

Because the number of monsters encountered is usually between a dozen and a hundred, platoon scale should be used for the assaults and battles, with units of 30 man-sized infantry or 15 large creatures or cavalry. Be sure to organize the garrison at platoon scale, too. (Remember that platoon-scale BR is four times higher per individual creature than company-scale BR.)

EXAMPLE: A wilderness domain of 225 families has a garrison expenditure of 900gp per month, with which it retains 60 heavy infantry (720gp per month) and 30 light infantry (180gp per month). At platoon scale, this equals 2 heavy infantry platoons (BR 2.0 each) and 1 heavy infantry platoon (BR 1.0). The garrison’s total BR is 5.0. This is more than enough to deal with most threats. Unfortunately, a bad encounter throw results in the arrival of an entire wilderness lair of orcs. The reaction roll is unfriendly. The Judge decides to use the average encounter: 6 platoons of 30 orcs, each with a BR of 1.0, for a total BR of 6.0. Since the orcs are unfriendly, and their BR is greater than the garrison’s BR, the orcs will fight if the garrison is deployed against them.

The Mass Combat for Domain Encounters tables below present the Battle Rating of various creatures based on their entries in the ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual****.* The number of creatures is pre-organized into platoon-scale units for average-sized wandering and lair wilderness encounters for your convenience.

EXAMPLE: According to the ***ACKS II MM***,a wilderness encounter with bugbears outside of their lair consists of a warband of 1d4 gangs of 2d4 warriors and 1 champion each. That yields an average of [2.5 x (2.5+2.5+1) ] = 15 bugbears. Therefore the Mass Combat for Domain Encounters table entry for bugbears suggests 1 platoon of 15 bugbears in the “Platoons” column.

Meanwhile, a wilderness encounter with bugbears in their lair consists of 1d10 warbands of 1d4 gangs of 2d4 warriors and 1 champion each. That yields an average of 5.5, rounded to 6, warbands. Therefore the Mass Combat for Domain Encounters table entry for bugbears suggests 6 platoons of 15 bugbears in the “Platoons (Lair”) column.

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Beastmen** | **BR** | **Platoons** | **Platoon BR** | **Platoons (Lair)** | **Platoon BR** | **Notes** |
| Beastman, Bugbear | 0.068 | 1 of 15 | 4.00 | 6 of 15 | 4.00 | 25% Lingering/Lair; Leaders |

Some encounter sizes have been adjusted slightly for ease of play and simplicity. Some encounters have been tagged, as follows:

* *Aerial:* The creatures are capable of observing from the air, granting them a +2 bonus to reconnaissance rolls.
* *Aquatic:* The creatures are aquatic. They cannot be attacked by land-based units.
* *Leaders:* The creatures are led by chieftains, sub-chieftains, shamans, and witch doctors. These NPCs can be deployed in heroic forays, but are not otherwise factored into the overall BR of the units. Champions are already factored into the platoons, as are drone bees, soldier ants, etc.
* *Lingering/Lair:* The creatures might linger or lair in the domain.

### The Vagaries of Recruitment

Raising an army can be an uncertain, challenging task. Some rulers find that peasants flock to their banners and mercenaries bid to serve them. Other would-be conquerors are abandoned by conscripts, cheated by mercenaries, betrayed by commanders, and preemptively attacked by rivals. Roll on the Vagaries of Recruitment table each month that a domain ruler is recruiting mercenaries, conscripts, militia, or vassal troops. If modifiers increase the roll to 101+, pick the best vagary for the ruler given his position. If modifiers decrease the roll to 0 or less, pick the worst vagary for the ruler given his position.

**Note:** Certain vagaries will cause the leader to gain or lose units. If the leader rules a duchy or principality, these will be battalion-sized units of 480 infantry or 240 cavalry. If the leader rules a kingdom or empire, these will be brigade-sized units of 1,920 infantry or 960 cavalry. In all other cases, the leader will gain or lose company-sized units of 120 infantry or 60 cavalry.

#### Vagaries of Recruitment Index

**Alliance Offered:** A nearby realm, impressed by the leader’s growing military might, offers an alliance. The ally should be selected from a neighboring domain or realm of approximately the same size as the leader’s own. (If no such domain or realm exists, re-roll this vagary). The ally will support the leader if he goes to war by sending troops worth 1gp per family in the ally’s realm.

**All Quiet:** No vagary befalls the leader this month.

**Bidding War:** A rival leader’s recruitment efforts make it harder to find and hire mercenaries. The cost of finding and hiring mercenaries is increased by 2d4 x 100%. The bidding war lasts for 1d6 months. (Note that mercenary *wages* are not changed.)

EXAMPLE: The cost of finding and hiring mercenaries across a principality is normally 5d6 x 100gp per month. However, a Bidding War vagary occurs. The Judge rolls 2d4 roll and gets a 5. The cost of finding and hiring mercenaries is increased 500% to 5d6 x 500gp per month.

**Bold Captain:** A young commander of surprising talent emerges from the army’s ranks to serve the leader. If the leader’s realm is a duchy or principality, the young commander has the characteristics of a mercenary major; if a kingdom, a colonel; and if an empire, a general. In all other cases, he has the characteristics of a mercenary captain. His base loyalty score is +1 instead of -2.

**Brigands:** Renegade mercenaries begin to harass the realm. The brigands can be treated as an independent enemy army for purposes of military campaigns. The brigand army consists of 1 unit of bowmen and 1 unit of light cavalry and is commanded by a mercenary officer. If the leader’s realm is a barony, viscounty, or county, the commander is a mercenary captain; if a duchy or principality, a mercenary colonel; and if a kingdom or empire, a mercenary general.

There is a 50% chance a crusader will accompany the brigand army and another 50% chance a mage will do so. The crusader and mage will be of level 1d3+2 in a barony, viscounty or county; 1d3+4 in a duchy or principality; and 1d3+6 in a kingdom or empire. Certain other minor NPCs might be present as scouts or chaplains. See the entry for Brigands in the ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual*** (p. XX).

**Commander Casualty:** Make a saving throw versus Death for each commander in the army, starting with the physically oldest commander. The first commander to fail the saving throw has died from falling off a horse, ill health, or other circumstances. The commander can be restored to life through **restore life and limb** or similar magic. (If no failure occurs, this event has no effect).

**Commerce Disrupted:** Rumors of war make the merchant’s guild nervous about doing business in the realm. The leader’s largest urban settlement is treated as one market class smaller for the next 1d6 months.

**Commerce Improves:** The increase in the size of the military makes the merchant’s guild feel secure. The leader’s largest urban settlement is treated as one market class larger for the next 1d6 months.

**Treacherous Mercenaries:** Immediately after receiving its wages, a unit of mercenaries abandons the army. When this vagary occurs, make a morale loyalty roll for each mercenary unit in the army, starting with the unit with the lowest loyalty. The first unit with a result of ‘Betray’ or ‘Immediate Attack’ deserts from the army the day after it is next paid. (If no failure occurs, this event has no effect).

**Foreign Legion:** A unit of mercenaries from a foreign realm offers its services to the army. The type of mercenaries will be of a sort not generally available to the leader. For example, if the leader is a legate of the Auran Empire, the unit might be horse archers from Skysos, barbarians from Jutland, or even wolf riders from the Waste. If hired, language difficulties and cultural mistrust will impose a -1 penalty on the unit’s base loyalty.

**Mercenaries:** A unit of mercenaries offers its services to the army. Determine the type of mercenaries by rolling on the Follower Type and Equipment by Class table (use the army leader’s class). There is a 25% chance the mercenaries are veterans.

**Resignation**: When this vagary occurs, make a loyalty roll for each commander in the army, starting with the commander with the lowest morale. The first commander with a result of ‘Betray’ or ‘Immediate Attack’ unexpectedly resigns. (If no failure occurs, this event has no effect). The reason for the commander’s resignation should be determined by you. It might be ill health, disappointment at assigned duties, disagreement with the leader’s foreign policy, defection to an enemy ruler, or other plausible reasons.

**Soldier of Fortune:** An experienced adventurer offers to serve the leader as a henchman. Generate the soldier of fortune using the NPC Parties rules in ***ACKS***. The soldier of fortune’s base level is two levels lower than that of the leader. The soldier of fortune will expect pay and position in the army appropriate to his class and level.

**Stout Recruits:** Hard times breed hard men. Twice as many conscripts and militia recruited this month qualify for advanced training (as heavy infantry, cavalry, etc.).

**Surplus Sellswords:** Peace has broken out in a neighboring realm, and its mercenaries are available for hire. The crop of mercenaries available in the leader’s realm is doubled for the next four time periods. Mercenary wages do not increase during this time, regardless of how many are hired.

**Tribute:** Tribute pours in from vassals and clients, increasing the leader’s war-chest. The leader receives gold pieces equal to the lesser of one month’s wages for his army or one gp per family in his overall realm. This increases his domain income for purposes of campaign XP.

**War Declared:** A rival ruler, threatened by the leader’s mustering of arms, declares war. The rival should be selected from a neighboring domain or realm of approximately the same size as the leader’s own. (If no such domain or realm exists, re-roll this vagary.) The rival will have a full complement of vassal troops, which he will use to attack as swiftly as possible.

**War Profiteers:** Merchants take advantage of the mobilization to raise prices. The cost of adventuring equipment, artillery ammunition, armor, mounts, weapons is increased by 10% for 1d4 seasons. Each time this vagary is rolled, prices increase an additional 10%.

**Weak Recruits:** Any conscripts and militia recruited this month are a weak and sickly lot. While normally 50% of conscripts and militia would qualify to be heavy infantry or archers, these pathetic excuses for soldiery cannot qualify as anything except light infantry.

### The Vagaries of War

An army on campaign in enemy territory, out of garrison for more than one month, may be subject to a variety of random events. It may acquire camp followers, be approached by mercenaries, or lose units to disease or desertion. Roll 1d100 on the Vagaries of War table each week after checking for supply.

An army besieging a stronghold, or under siege within a stronghold, suffers even more stress. Roll 1d100 twice per week and use whichever result is lower (worse). Use of the Vagaries of War table during sieges is highly recommended because a siege is just not a siege without the chance for an epidemic…

**Notes:** Certain vagaries will cause the leader to gain or lose units. If the leader rules a duchy or principality, these will be battalion-sized units of 480 infantry or 240 cavalry. If the leader rules a kingdom or empire, these will be brigade-sized units of 1,920 infantry or 960 cavalry. In all other cases, the leader will gain or lose company-sized units of 120 infantry or 60 cavalry.

#### Vagaries of War Index

**All Quiet:** No vagary befalls this army this week.

**Artillery Cache:** The army has stumbled upon a cache of artillery set aside by some foresighted commander in prior campaigns. The army finds 1d4 different artillery units. Each has 1d6 days’ worth of ammunition.

**Brigands:** Brigands raid the army’s supply lines. Until the brigands are dealt with, the army’s supply costs are increased by 10% (representing provisions lost to banditry) and its reconnaissance rolls are at -1 (because of the need to divert light troops from scouting to guarding the supply lines). The brigands can be treated as an independent enemy army for purposes of military campaigns. The brigand army consists of 1 unit of bowmen and 1 unit of light cavalry and is commanded by a mercenary officer. If the leader’s realm is a barony, viscounty, or county, the commander is a mercenary captain; if a duchy or principality, a mercenary colonel; and if a kingdom or empire, a mercenary general.

There is a 50% chance a crusader will accompany the brigand army and another 50% chance a mage will do so. The crusader and mage will be of level 1d3+2 in a barony, viscounty or county; 1d3+4 in a duchy or principality; and 1d3+6 in a kingdom or empire. Certain other minor NPCs might be present as scouts or chaplains. See the entry for Brigands in the ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual*** (p. XX).

**Brigands:** The brigands can be treated as an independent enemy army. The brigand “army” consists of 1 company of bowmen and 1 company of medium cavalry, each led by a 3rd level fighter with command characteristics of a mercenary lieutenant. The overall army leader will be a 6th level fighter with command characteristics of a mercenary captain. The captain will employ 2 4th level explorers or thieves as scouts. There is a 50% chance that the brigands will be accompanied by 1d3 3rd level crusaders led by a crusader of level 1d3+2. There is a 50% chance that the brigands will be accompanied by 1d2 theurgists (2nd level mages) led by a mage of level 1d3+2. See the entry for Brigands in the ***ACKS II******Monstrous Manual***for more details.

**Camp Followers:** The army has attracted a following of itinerants, tinkers, harlots, peddlers, and camp-wives. The presence of the civilians creates chaos and ill-discipline. While the camp followers are with the army, its expedition speed is reduced by 1/3, and enemy spies gain a +2 bonus to conduct hijinks against the army. Nevertheless, the soldiers enjoy having the camp followers around! If the army leader drives off the camp followers, this counts as a calamity for morale purposes.

**Commander Casualty:** Make a Death saving throw for each commander in the army, starting with the physically oldest commander. The first commander to fail the saving throw has died from falling off a horse, ill health, or other circumstances. The commander can be restored to life through **restore life and limb** or similar magic. (If no failure occurs, this event has no effect).

**Defection:** When this vagary occurs, make a morale roll for each commander in the relevant army, starting with the commander with the lowest morale. The first commander with a result of ‘Betray’ or ‘Immediate Attack’ becomes a defector. (If no failure occurs, this event has no effect.) If there is an opposing army within one week’s march, the defector will immediately defect from his current army and bring the units under his command over to the opposing army. Otherwise, the defector will wait until an opportune moment presents itself, feigning loyalty until then.

**Desertion:** When this vagary occurs, make a morale roll for each unit in the army, starting with the unit with the lowest morale. The first unit with a result of ‘Betray’ or ‘Immediate Attack’ deserts from the army. (If no failure occurs, this event has no effect.) If there is an enemy force within one week’s march, the deserters will join the opposing army. Otherwise, the deserters will simply disband and make for home.

**Disease:** Disease is endemic to any military campaign, and at any time 1%-2% of the troops are probably ill with colds, diarrhea, or fevers. This vagary represents something much worse: A major epidemic breaking out amidst the army.

When this vagary occurs, the type of disease is determined with a roll of 1d100 on the Disease Type table. Each unit must then make a Death saving throw against the disease. Certain diseases, being less acute, offer a saving throw bonus.

|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Disease Type** | | | | |
| **Die Roll** | **Disease Type** | **Save Bonus** | **Duration** | **Death** |
| 1-5 | Plague | 0 | 1d8 days | Failed by 6+ |
| 6-15 | Putrid Fever | 0 | 2 weeks | Failed by 7+ |
| 16-30 | Spotted Pox | +1 | 3 weeks | Failed by 8+ |
| 31-50 | Bilious Fever | +2 | 4 weeks | Failed by 8+ |
| 51-75 | Ague | +3 | 1d4 weeks | Failed by 10+ |
| 76-100 | Bloody Flux | +4 | 1 week | Rolled Natural 1 |

If the saving throw succeeds, the troops in the unit avoid any serious illness. If the saving throw fails, the troops in the unit become **incapacitated** for the listed duration. Diseased troops cannot move or fight.

At the end of the duration, diseased troops either recover or die. If the saving throw failed on a roll of natural 1, or by the amount noted on the Disease Type table, the diseased troops expire from the illness, and the unit is removed from play. Otherwise, the diseased troops recover. Saving throws should be made secretly by you, so the army commanders are unaware of whether their units will recover.

Note that while onset time can be an important factor for adventurers facing disease (see p. XX), it is not a factor when a disease vagary occurs – the disease has already spread through the army.

,

EXAMPLE: An army of 4 0th-level mercenary units is on campaign when a “disease” event is rolled. The Judge rolls 1d100 on the Disease Type table and gets a 30, so the disease is spotted pox. Each unit must make a saving throw versus Death at +1. 0th level mercenaries have a saving throw versus Death of 15+, so with the +1 bonus the units will need to roll a 14 or better. The first unit rolls a 14 and avoids the illness. The second unit rolls a 10. It is diseased for three weeks, but then recovers. The third unit rolls a natural 1. It is diseased for three weeks, then eliminated (since it rolled a natural 1 on the save). The fourth unit rolls a 4. It is diseased for three weeks, then eliminated (since it failed the save by 8 or more).

Diseased units can be cured through treatment by divine spellcasters and/or healers. It requires one 9th level divine spellcaster, two 7th-8th level divine spellcasters, three 6th level divine spellcasters or chirugeons, or nine physickers to cure one sickened unit in one week. If there are a greater or lesser number of casters or healers, the rate at which disease can be cured is increased or decreased proportionately.

EXAMPLE: The army has one 7th level crusader and one chirugeon with it. After two weeks of casting **cure disease** each day, the crusader can cure a unit. After three weeks of treating troops with medicine, and a successful proficiency throw, the chirugeon can cure a second unit. There is not enough time before the course of the illness ends for either the crusader or the chirugeon to treat additional units.

**Friendly Lord:** A local lord makes generous gestures towards the army. He will offer to become a vassal or sub-vassal of the army leader, and extend the use of his stronghold as a supply base. He will also pay a tribute of gold equal to his monthly income. In exchange, the lord will expect his domain to be protected from looting, conquest, and pillage by the army.

**Friendly Peasants:** The local populace keeps the army appraised of enemy movements. The army gains a +2 to all reconnaissance rolls for the next week. This benefit is lost if the army requisitions or loots supplies from any domains during the week.

**Good Omen:** A positive portent, such as a comet, a flight of eagles, or a vision of a deity in the clouds, improves the army’s morale. Morale rolls gain a +1 bonus for the next week. Add 10 to the army’s next roll on the Vagaries of War table.

**Good Weather:** Good weather shines on the army. While this vagary occurs, you should roll twice each day for temperature, precipitation, and wind and apply whichever result is better. (If you have rolled the weather in advance, roll once each day and substitute the new result if better.)

**Ill Omen:** An ominous portent, such as an encounter with diseased animals, a flight of crows, or a dark face in a storm, worries the troops. Morale rolls suffer a -1 penalty for the next week. Subtract 10 from the army’s next roll on the Vagaries of War table.

**Legendary Leadership:** A legend begins to grow around the army’s leader. He acquires a sobriquet or victory title, such as “Lion-Hearted” or “Hammer of the Scots.” His morale modifier is increased by 1. The benefit is lost if the leader’s army is ever defeated in two consecutive battles.

**Local Guides:** Helpful natives offer to guide the army through their land. If the offer is accepted, the local guides increase the army’s speed by 33% through their knowledge of hidden passes and forgotten roads. The local guides remain with the army for one week. The bonus from local guides does not apply if the army is already following a road.

**Mercenaries:** A unit of mercenaries offers its services to the army. Determine the type of mercenaries by rolling on the Follower Type and Equipment by Class table (use the leader’s class). There is a 25% chance the mercenaries are veterans.

**Ministers:** 2d6 crusaders of level 1d4 announce join the campaign and begin ministering to the troops. The presence of these holy men increases the morale of all units in the army by +1. The ministers depart the army if camp followers (see above) are permitted on the campaign or if the army leader acts contrary to their faith.

**Plans Discovered:** Through an intercepted courier, mole, or other means, one army has gotten access to the battle plans of the other. The army benefiting from this vagary learns the location, organization, and leadership of the opposing army as if it had scored a major success on a reconnaissance roll. It also automatically wins the next initiative roll against the opposing army.

**Severe Weather:** This vagary represents a bout of very severe weather, lasting for 1d4 weeks. (If this vagary is rolled again while a severe weather vagary is ongoing, add the durations together.) While this vagary occurs, you should roll twice each day for temperature, precipitation, and wind and apply whichever result is worse. (If you have rolled the weather in advance, roll once each day and substitute the new result if worse.) It should be noted that this vagary is *far* more punishing on certain seasonal and terrain combinations than others. Winter campaigns in mountain terrain or summer campaigns in jungle terrain, for example, can be disastrous. It should be noted that this vagary is *far* more punishing on certain seasonal and terrain combinations than others. Winter campaigns in mountain terrain or summer campaigns in jungle terrain, for example, can be disastrous.

**Siege Train Problems:** The hazards of campaigning are hard on siege artillery. Making a saving throw versus Death for each artillery piece in the army. If the artillery has a siege engineer or artillerist assigned to it, it saves as a 4th level fighter; otherwise, it saves a normal man. A failed saving throw means the artillery piece has broken (0 shp). Broken artillery can be repaired as a construction project (remember that repair rate for wood is 5 shp per gp of construction rate).

**Spy Found:** The army has caught a spy infiltrated into the army by an opposing army. If the opposing army or armies have two or more spies infiltrated into the army, choose one randomly. If the opposing army or armies haven’t infiltrated any spies into the army, then the army has caught a soldier that had just become a turncoat. In any case,the spy can be interrogated. He will know 1d4 common pieces of information about the opposing army.

**Spy Lost:** The army has lost a spy it sent to infiltrate an opposing army. If the army has sent two or more spies to infiltrate an opposing army, choose one randomly. If the army hasn’t sent any spies to infiltrate any opposing armies, then the opposing army has caught a soldier that had just become a turncoat. In any case, the spy can be interrogated. He will know 1d4 common pieces of information about the army.

**Supply Boon:** The army is well-provisioned by local sources. The army might get donations of bread from friendly peasants, stumble upon a herd of migrating animals, or be able to fish in nearby lakes and rivers. The army is automatically in supply this week, without the army leader being responsible for paying supply cost. The army’s market class is raised by 1 for purposes of equipment availability this month.

**Supply Problems:** The army’s supplies do not arrive this week. Whether this is due to bad weather, bandits, corruption, sabotage, or other causes, the result is the same: The army is out of supply. Supply problems can cause even the most lawful, well-provisioned force to turn to requisitioning and looting, for otherwise the army will suffer the unfortunate consequences of lack of supply (-1 hp per day, -1 to attack throws and damage rolls per day, and a morale calamity).

**Treacherous Guides:** Helpful-seeming natives offer to guide the army through their land. If the offer is accepted, the guides begin spying on the army for the enemy. Increase the army’s movement rate by 33%, but give the enemy one free hijink and a +1 bonus on reconnaissance rolls. The local guides remain with the army for one week.

**War Profiteers:** Merchants are making enormous profits from the campaign. The cost of artillery ammunition, armor, mounts, supplies, and weapons is increased by 10% for the duration of the campaign. Each time this vagary is rolled, prices increase an additional 10%.

### The Vagaries of Battle

Battles are never straightforward, particularly when heroes, wizards, and monsters are involved. Each time the adventurers make a heroic foray as described in the ***ACKS II Revised Rulebook***, roll 1d4 to determine the number of vagaries that will occur. For each vagary, roll 1d100 on the Vagaries of Battle table to see what the adventurers are confronted with.

**Note:** Whenever “battlefield” is mentioned below, it refers to the particular area of the battlefield where the foray is being fought, not necessarily the battlefield as a whole. Whenever “adventurer” is mentioned, it refers to the player characters making the foray as well as any followers, henchmen, or hirelings that accompanied them on the foray.

#### Vagaries of Battle Index

**Ambush:** A trap is sprung and the battle is suddenly more dangerous. All of the adventurers must roll for surprise with a -2 penalty. The distance between the adventurers and each group of foes is halved.

**Battle Standards:** The vanguards of the armies are so close that each side’s battle standard is within sight. Double the BR staked for this foray. (For example, if the adventurers staked 2 points of BR when they entered the foray, resolve the foray as if they had staked 4 BR.) All creatures on either side gain +2 to morale rolls because of the presence of their battle standards.

**Blood and Mud:** The battlefield here is soaked in blood and mud. Due to the wet, slippery conditions, creatures that roll a natural 1 on attack or saving throws fall prone.

**Bombardment:** A nearby unit of artillery begins lobbing fire onto the battlefield. 1d4 rounds after the foray begins, make an attack throw with a target value of 18+ (ignoring armor) against each creature in the foray. A hit means the creature has been caught in the blast radius of a catapult stone, and suffers 4d6 extraordinary bludgeoning damage unless it makes a successful Blast save.

**Booby Traps:** Battlefield traps confound, kill, and maim the unwary. There is one trap on the battlefield for each point of BR staked. The typical battlefield trap is a concealed pit filled with sharpened stakes. An adventure moving at combat speed has a 1 in 6 chance of moving into a previously-undiscovered battlefield trap each round, while an adventuring moving at charging/running speed has a 2 in 6 chance. If an adventurer moves into the trap, he falls 10’ (1d6 bludgeoning damage) onto 1d4 spikes (each dealing 1d6 piercing damage).

**Calm Amidst the Storm:** No vagary occurs.

**Culmination:** The battle nears a culminating point as troops from both sides join the foray. In each of the first 5 rounds of the foray, an additional 10 HD of creatures will join per point of Battle Rating staked.

**Debris:** The area where the fighting occurs is littered with tree limbs, crumbling walls, spent ammunition, and similar debris. Creatures that run or charge must make successful Paralysis saving throws or fall prone half-way through their move.

**Debris, Dangerous:** The fighting is taking place on terrain dangerously littered with discarded weapons, splinters of shattered wood, and fragments of bone. Creatures that run or charge must make a Paralysis save or fall prone and suffer 1d4 bludgeoning damage.

**Debris, Heavy:** The battlefield is punctuated with breached stone walls, fallen trees, ancient ruins, and other obstacles. Speeds are halved, and no charging or running is permitted. Thieves and others skilled in hiding will find ample cover available to make use of their abilities (+2 bonus to proficiency throws).

**Deserters:** Deserters seeking to flee the battlefield interrupt the fight. The deserters will arrive 1d4 rounds after the foray begins. They will belong to whichever side has fewer HD present in the foray. There will be 10 HD of deserters present per point of BR staked. The deserters will enter the battlefield from the enemy’s side and seek to escape to the friendly side. The deserters will attack any creatures that block their escape. PCs and NPCs from their side may attempt to rally them to return to the fight by making reaction rolls.

**Fire:** The battlefield is on fire! Burning pitch, flaming arrows, fire-breathing monsters, or magical spells have ignited blood, flesh, trees, and oil. Each round, all participants must make successful Blast saving throws or suffer 1d4 fire damage. Maximum visibility distance is reduced to 20’ due to smoke.

**Fog and Smoke:** A thick cloud obscures the battlefield, because of dust kicked up by marching men, magical clouds, burning smoke, and so on. Maximum visibility distance is reduced to 20’ for the duration of the foray.

**High Ground:** The defending army has seized the high ground. All of its forces in this foray gain a +1 bonus to attack throws because the forces of the attacking army are **subjacent**.

**Marauders:** Bandits and cut-throats are attempting to use the chaos of battle for their sinister ends. 1d4 rounds after the foray begins, 10 HD of brigands arrive per point of Battle Rating staked. The brigands will attack weak and damaged creatures and make off with their carried equipment. Brigands are often deserters of one side or the other who have fled from fighting elsewhere but can also be independent forces.

**Monsters:** Monsters have been drawn to the battlefield by the blood and slaughter. 1d4 rounds after the foray begins, 10 HD of monsters arrive per point of Battle Rating staked. You can pick the monster type or determine it randomly based on the battlefield’s terrain. The monsters will attack weak and damaged creatures.

**Piles of Dead:** Huge piles of dead troops lay in heaps on the ground. Speeds are halved because of the carrion obstacles, and no charging or running is permitted. The corpses can be **animated** by necromancers. Thieves and others skilled in hiding will find ample cover available to make use of their abilities (+2 bonus to proficiency throws). All creatures suffer a -2 penalty to morale rolls due to the awful carnage.

**Scattered Bodies:** 1d10 x 10 bodies of the fallen are scattered across the battlefield. The corpses can be **animated** by necromancers. Because of the cadaverous litter, creatures that run or charge must make successful Paralysis saving throws or fall prone half-way through their move. All creatures suffer a -1 penalty to morale rolls due to sight of the casualties.

**Reinforcements:** Additional troops join the foray from one of the sides 1d4 rounds after it begins. 10 HD of creatures will join per point of Battle Rating staked.

**Volley of Arrows:** Arrows fill the skies, striking friend and foe. 1d4 rounds after the foray begins, make an attack throw with a target value of 11+ (modified by AC) against each creature in the foray. A hit deals 1d6 piercing damage to the creature struck.
