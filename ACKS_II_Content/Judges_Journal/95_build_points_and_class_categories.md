## Build Points and Class Categories

Creating a custom class is primarily process of allocating **build points** to various **class categories** that define the strengths and weaknesses of the class, and then making various choices that flow from the build point allocation.

All Human Classes have **4** (**four**) build points to spend on five class categories: **Hit Dice**, **Fighting**, **Thievery**, **Divine**, and **Arcane**. Each category is allocated between 0 and 4 points. The final total spent on the class *must* equal 4 build points. The Hit Dice class category determines the Hit Die the class uses, while the Fighting, Thievery, Divine, and Arcane class categories grant abilities associated with the core *ACKS* classes of fighter, thief, crusader, and mage. (While explorer and venturer are deemed core classes in ***ACKS II***, they do not have an associated class category value, and are actually hybrids of Fighting and Thievery.)

Within each category, there are sometimes opportunities to make **trade-offs** after build points have been allocated**.** Trade-offs allow characters to buy **custom powers** such as the elven nightblade’s Acrobatics or the bard’s Inspire Courage ability. Custom powers are powers which are not present in the core four classes (crusader, fighter, mage, thief) and they can only be selected by making trade-offs. Trade-offs can be complex. When creating an initial set of Custom Classes, it may be helpful to ignore the trade-off options initially.

Note that certain values, which appear in parentheses, exceed the abilities normally found in *ACKS Imperial Imprint* and similar games*.* While we believe the values below are balanced, these selections could and should be prohibited in a given campaign by any Judge which feels they would disrupt play.

In general, any system of build points is susceptible to abuse and you must carefully review all custom classes for balance. Just because something *can* be built doesn’t mean it *should* be built or *must* be allowed in play.
