## The Basics

The Abstract Dungeon rules assume that an organized group of **adventurers** goes on an **delve** to clear out a **dungeon**. The delve can consist of a single **foray** into the dungeon or multiple forays. Any number of adventurers can go on a delve, but a maximum of eight can go on any single foray into the dungeon.

 The **party** for a foray consists of one or more adventurers. The **party level** is the equal to the total of all characters’ levels, divided by the number of adventurers or by 4, whichever is greater. Round fractions of 0.5 or greater up, 0.49 or lower down. (Put another way, for parties of four or more adventurers, party level is equal to the average of the characters’ levels, while for parties of less than four adventurers, party level is equal to the sum of the characters’ levels divided by 4.)

EXAMPLE: The Claws of the Lioness are a party consisting of Ranya, a 4th level bladedancer; Girdanus Tarvo, a 3rd level fighter; Yrsa, a 4th level witch; and Maon, a 2nd level elven spellsword. The party level is [ (4 + 3 + 4 + 2) / 4] 3.25, rounded to 3.

EXAMPLE #2: Moruvai, a 9th level ruinguard, enters a dungeon alone. The party level for his foray is (9 / 4) 2.25, rounded to 2.

Parties of more than four adventurers gain a bonus in forays, discussed below.
