## Step 5: Estimate Domain Populations and Incomes

The **Revenue by Realm Type** table below shows the size of the personal domain of various tiers of nobility, their monthly income from domains, and their monthly income from urban settlements. The Revenue by Realm Type table assumes that at each tier of nobility, the nobles have 4-6 vassals of the next tier below them, who each hold a vassal realm, as per the Political Division of Realms.

| **Revenue by Realm Type** | | | | | |
| **Type of**  **Realm** |  | **Personal Domain**  **(families)** | **Stronghold**  **Value (gp)** | **Realm Population**  **(families)** | **Domain Income/**  **Month (gp)** |
| Empire |  | ~ 12,500 | 720,000+ | 1.5M – 11.6M+ | 250,000-425,000+ |
| Kingdom |  | ~ 12,500 | 480,000 | 364K – 2,000K | 120,000-215,000 |
| Principality |  | ~ 7,500 | 360,000 | 87K – 322K | 50,000-100,000 |
| Duchy |  | ~ 1,500 | 115,000 | 20,000 – 52,000 | 14,500-30,000 |
| County |  | ~ 780 | 70,000 | 3,600 – 10,000 | 5,000-10,000 |
| March |  | ~ 320 | 45,000 | 960 – 1,280 | 2,000-3,200 |
| Barony |  | ~ 160 | 22,500 | 120-200 | 450-760 |

Since that’s exactly the pattern you’ve established in your sandbox, you can use this chart to quickly estimate the population and income of the Princes, Dukes, and Counts in our sandbox. You do not need to “build” every domain in detail as if it were a PC domain – all you need are approximations when your campaign begins.

In the Borderlands, the Prefect of Cyfaraun has a personal domain of 7,500 families; a realm population of 95,970 families; and a domain income of 62,400gp. Each Palatine has a personal domain of around 1,250 families; a realm population of around 21,500 families; and a domain income of around 19,000gp. Each Legate has a personal domain of around 725 families; a realm population of around 3,825 families; and a domain income of around 5,150gp. All of these are within the ranges on the table above. (You can find the full domain sheets with exact numbers for the rulers of the Borderlands in ***AX3 Capital of the Borderlands***.)

After you’ve made some income estimates, pause and compare the income estimates to the monthly XP thresholds by class level in ***ACKS II****.* What you should see is that each ruler’s income is within one level of the XP threshold for his level. For instance, Prefect Basilio of Cyfaraun is 11th level, with an XP threshold of 45,000. His income is 62,400gp, so Basilio is earning (62,400 – 45,000) 17,400 XP each month. Eventually he’ll reach 12th level, and his XP threshold will jump to 75,000. At that point his income will cease earning him XP and he’ll need to somehow expand his realm. In other words, just by comparing income, class level, and monthly XP threshold you can determine if the NPC is ambitious to expand, content with his lot, or out of his league!
