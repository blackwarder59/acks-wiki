Entries marked with an asterisk were particularly influential on the game, with inspiration ranging from large-scale battles, to alignment, cleaving, places of power, and various races and monsters. The Lancer/Ace series of *Conan* paperbacks (“Conan the Adventurer,” “Conan the Conqueror,” etc.) were the origin of the game’s name. Many of the other books have been selected because they are set in classical or late antiquity, or fictional variants thereof, and can be useful references for Judges who want to gain a better understanding of the Auran Empire setting.
