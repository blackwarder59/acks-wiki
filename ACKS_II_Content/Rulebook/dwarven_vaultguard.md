## Dwarven Vaultguard

Key Attribute: STR

Requirements: CON 9

Hit Dice: 1d8

Maximum Level: 13

Dwarves trained to defend their race's underground vault from the endless hordes that threaten it are called vaultguards. Though most vaultguards are born, live and die in the vault, from time to time a young vaultguard will be dispatched to foreign realms on a warrior's pilgrimage. The few vaultguards who return from such pilgrimages bring gold and glory to their clans, often leading them to found new vaults and become great lords.

### Combat Characteristics

Vaultguards are the most highly-trained combatants fielded by the dwarves.

**Combat Proficiencies:** Vaultguards have weapon proficiency with all weapons except long bows or two-handed swords (due to their short stature). They have armor proficiency with all armor. They have fighting style proficiency with the weaponand shield, two-handed weapon, and dual weapon styles.

**Combat Progression:** Vaultguards advance in attack throws and saving throws as fighters, by two points every three levels of experience. They increase their base damage roll from successful missile and melee attacks by +1 at 1st level, and by an additional +1 at 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th level. They can cleave after killing a foe a maximum of once per round per class level.

### Starting Class Powers

At the start of play, vaultguards have the following class power:

**Manual of Arms:** The vaultguard is highly experienced in military discipline, physical fitness, and weapon drill. He can automatically identify the battle standards, equipment, great captains, military slang, and rank insignia of his clan and vault. He can identify those of other clans, vaults, or realms with a proficiency throw of 11+. He can fight as a regular (rather than irregular) troop in formed and loose units. He can begin play as a member of a legion, mercenary's guild, or other military organization (Judge's discretion). (This class power is equivalent to one rank of Manual of Arms proficiency.)

### Additional Class Powers

When they advance in level, vaultguards gain the following additional class powers:

**Battlefield Prowess (5th level):** The vaultguard's presence inspires troops he leads. Any henchmen and mercenaries hired by the vaultguard gain a +1 bonus to their morale score whenever he personally leads them. This bonus stacks with any modifiers from the vaultguard's Charisma or proficiencies.

**Vault (9th level):** By acquiring a **vault** worth at least 15,000gp, the vaultguard can attract dwarves to his service. 3d6 x 10 1st level dwarven mercenaries arrive to serve him as followers within 1d3 months of him acquiring the vault. If the vaultguard already acquired a vault, the followers arrive to serve him within 1d3 months of him reaching 9th level. The vaultguard must pay his followers the ordinary rates for mercenaries and henchmen or they leave his service. Additional rules for vaults are detailed in the **Campaigns** chapter (p. XX).

### Racial Traits

As dwarves, vaultguards have certain powers and drawbacks associated with their race.

**Dwarf Tongues:** Dwarves can speak the Common and Dwarvish tongues and, because of their frequent interaction underground with beastmen, can also speak Goblin, Gnome, and Kobold.

**Hardy:** Dwarves are tough. The target values for all their Blast saving throws are improved by 3, while the target values for all their other saving throws are improved by 4. (These adjustments are already factored into the saving throws on the Dwarven Vaultguard Attack and Saving Throws table.)

**Sensitivity to Rock and Stone:** Dwarves gain a +1 bonus to surprise rolls when underground. When using Adventuring proficiency to search or listen, they succeed on a proficiency throw of 14+ (instead of the usual 18+). If separately proficient in Searching they gain a +4 bonus to their throw instead. If separately proficient in Listening, they gain a +2 bonus to their throw instead.

### Class Proficiencies

**Proficiency Progression:** At 1st level, vaultguards select one class proficiency from their class proficiency list and one general proficiency from the general proficiency list. They select an additional class proficiency at 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th level. They select an additional general proficiency at 5th, 9th, and 13th level.
