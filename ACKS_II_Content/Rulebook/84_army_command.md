## Army Command

After the leader has organized his army into units and divisions, he must assign officers to it. Officers consist of **commanders**, **adjutants**, and **lieutenants**. Each division must have a commander. Each commander may have an adjutant. Each unit may have a lieutenant. Only exceptionally well-trained and organized armies, such as the historical Roman legion, will have lieutenant characters for every unit.

The army leader will generally serve as one of the commanders, while other adventurers or high-level henchmen and followers fill the remaining commander and adjutant positions. If an army has lieutenants, these might be drawn from the henchmen of the various commanders. Alternatively, **mercenary officers** (p. XX) can be hired as commanders, adjutants, and lieutenants.

### Qualifying as an Officer

A PC or NPC must be at least 6th level to serve as a commander or adjutant in a campaign battle, and must be of at least 5th level to serve as a lieutenant.

A monster must have at least four more Hit Dice than is average for the creatures it commands to serve as a commander in a campaign battle, and at least two more Hit Dice than is average to serve as a lieutenant. However, a beastman chieftain can always serve as a commander for units of its own race, regardless of its HD. Likewise, a beastman sub-chieftain can always serve as a lieutenant for a unit of its race.

The officer requirements can be waived by the Judge if he feels a particular PC, NPC, or monster is in a position to command units despite not meeting these qualifications.

### Officer Characteristics

Commanders have three officer characteristics: **leadership ability**, **strategic ability**, and **morale modifier**. Adjutants only use strategic ability, while lieutenants only use morale modifier, but it is worth calculating their other characteristics because they might later be appointed commanders to replace casualties.

**Leadership Ability:** This is the maximum number of units the character can readily control at once during a battle. (It also determines the number of divisions a leader may have in his army, as explained earlier). A character’s leadership ability is equal to the number of henchmen the character may retain, i.e. 4 plus his Charisma bonus or penalty. If the commander has Leadership proficiency, the commander’s leadership ability is increased by 1. If the commander is using an adjutant, his Leadership Ability is reduced by 1. The maximum leadership ability is 8.

EXAMPLE: Marcus has CHA 16 (+2) and Leadership proficiency. His leadership ability is (4 + 2 + 1) 7.

For monstrous officers without Charisma scores, calculate leadership ability as 3 + 1 per 4 HD, rounded down, to a maximum of 8.

EXAMPLE: An orc chieftain has 4 HD, so it will have a leadership ability of (3 + 4/4) 4. A venerable red dragon has 20 HD, so it will have a leadership ability of (3 + (20/4)) 8.

**Strategic Ability***:*This rates the character’s military puissance and effectiveness. Great strategic ability demands great cunning and iron will and no truly superior officer will be lacking in either. An officer’s strategic ability score equals his bonus from either high Intellect or Will (whichever is better, minimum 0), less his penalty from low Intellect or Will (whichever is worse, maximum 0). For each rank of Military Strategy proficiency the officer possesses, his strategic ability is increased by 1. The minimum strategic ability is -3 and the maximum strategic ability is +6.

EXAMPLE: Marcus has INT 14 (+1), WIL 11 (0), and 2 ranks of Military Strategy. His strategic ability is (1 – 0 + 2) +3.

EXAMPLE: Seanan has INT 18 (+3), WIL 7 (-1), and 3 ranks of Military Strategy. His strategic ability is (+3 – 1 + 3) +5.

A commander with an adjutant can use his adjutant’s Strategic Ability – 1 in place of his own.

EXAMPLE: Marcus has strategic ability +3. Seanan, with strategic ability +5, is Marcus’s adjutant. Marcus can use Seanan’s strategic ability – 1, so he functions as if his strategic ability were at +4 because of the wise counsel of his adjutant.

For monstrous officers without Intellect or Will scores, their strategic ability is 0 + 1 per 5 HD, rounded down. If the monster is of generally sub-human intelligence (e.g., beastmen) strategic ability is reduced by 1. If the monster is of generally high intelligence (e.g. medusas or vampires), strategic ability is increased by 1. If the monster is of super-human intelligence (e.g., venerable dragons), it is increased by 2. The Judge might adjust the strategic ability score based on his assessment of the monster’s experience and tactical knowledge.

EXAMPLE: An orc chieftain has a strategic ability of [(4 / 5, rounded down) – 1], or -1. A venerable red dragon (20 HD) has a strategic ability of [(20 / 5) + 2] +6.

**Morale Modifier:** A character’s morale modifier modifies rolls on the Unit Morale table (p. XX) made by units under his command. (Morale modifier does notaffect rolls on the Unit Loyalty table!) Morale modifier is equal to the character’s Charisma bonus or penalty. If the character is a barbarian, bard, explorer, fighter, or paladin of 5th level or higher, his morale modifier is increased by +1 (from his **battlefield prowess** class power or equivalent). If a character has Command proficiency, his morale modifier is increased by +2. If a commander uses an adjutant’s strategic ability in place of his own, he inspires less confidence in his troops, so his morale modifier is decreased by 1. Some class powers and random events can also adjust a character’s morale modifier.

EXAMPLE: Marcus is a 9th level fighter with CHA 16 (+2) and the Command proficiency. His morale modifier is (2 + 1 + 2) +5. If he makes Seanan his adjutant, his morale modifier is reduced to +4, however.

For monstrous officers without Charisma scores, their morale modifier is usually 0. However, whenever the monster entry notes that “as long as [monstrous commander] is alive, the [monsters of a given type] will gain a [bonus] to morale rolls,” use the listed bonus as the monster’s morale modifier.

EXAMPLE: As long as an orc chieftain is alive, orcs gain a +2 to morale rolls. An orc chieftain’s morale modifier is +2.

### Role of Officers

An officer’s leadership ability, strategic ability, and morale modifier impact the success of his troops in waging war. An army with mediocre officers, or insufficient numbers of officers given the size of the army, will be substantially disadvantaged in fighting. These mechanics are detailed hereafter and intensively explored in ***Domains at War: Battles****.*
