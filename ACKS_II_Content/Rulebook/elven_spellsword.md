## Elven Spellsword

Key Attribute: STR and INT

Requirements: None

Hit Dice: 1d6

Maximum Level: 10

Elves are lithe, fey beings with pointed ears, delicate features, and graceful movement. They typically weigh about 130 lbs and stand between 5' 6" and 6' tall. Humans envy their long lifespans and seeming agelessness. Though elves are a peaceful people that enjoy poetry and art, they are also very talented fighters and skilled mages. Within the Auran Empire, most elves dwell in the isolated forests of Northern Argollë; those that traffic in the kingdoms of man are both bold and remarkable. The elven spellsword class represents one such remarkable elf, trained in the arts of both fighters and mages.

### Combat Characteristics

Elven spellswords learn an elegant, deadly style of fighting that enables them to cast arcane spells while fully armored.

**Combat Proficiencies:** Elven spellswords have weapon proficiency with all weapons, armor proficiency with all armor, and fighting style proficiency with all three optional styles (i.e. the dual weapon, two-handed weapon, and weaponand shield styles).

**Combat Progression:** Elven spellswords advance in attack throws and saving throws as fighters, by two points every three levels of experience. They increase their base damage roll from successful missile and melee attacks by +1 at 1st level, and by an additional +1 at 3rd, 6th, and 9th level. They can cleave after killing a foe a maximum of once per round per class level.

### Starting Class Powers

At the start of play, elven spellswords have the following class powers.

**Arcane Magic:** Elven spellswords can learn and cast powerful arcane spells. The number and levels of spells the spellsword can cast in a single day are listed on the Elven Spellsword Spell Progression table. A spellsword's spell selection is limited to the spells in his **repertoire**. A spellsword's repertoire can include a number of spells up to the number and level of spells listed for his level, increased by his Intellect bonus. Unlike (human) mages, elven spellswords can also cast spells while wearing armor. More information on casting spells and individual spell descriptions can be found in the **Spells** chapter.

**Collegiate Wizardry**: The spellsword has received arcane instruction as an apprentice to a spellsword, pupil at a magical academy, or member of an arcane organization. He can begin play as a member of a wizard's guild or similar order (Judge's discretion). He can automatically identify arcane symbols, spell signatures, trappings, and grimoires of his own order or tradition, and can recognize those of other orders or traditions with a proficiency throw of 11+. Rare or esoteric traditions might be harder to recognize. (This class power is the equivalent of one rank of Collegiate Wizardry proficiency.)

### Additional Class Powers

When they advance in level, spellswords gain the following additional class powers:

**Minor Magical Research (5th level):** The elven spellsword can research spells, scribe magical scrolls, and brew potions.

**Major Magical Research (9th level):** The elven spellsword can create more powerful magic items such as weapons, rings, and staffs.

**Fastness (9th level):** By acquiring a **fastness** worth at least 15,000gp in a natural setting such as a forest or glen, the elven spellsword can attract elves to his service. 3d6 x 10 1st level elven mercenaries arrive to serve him as followers within 1d3 months of him acquiring the fastness. If the spellsword has already acquired a fastness, the followers arrive to serve him within 1d3 months of him reaching 9th level. The spellsword must pay his followers the ordinary rates for mercenaries and henchmen or they leave his service. Additional rules for elven fastnesses are detailed in the **Campaigns** chapter (p. XX).

### Racial Traits

As elves, spellswords have certain powers and drawbacks associated with their race.

**Attunement to Nature:** Elves gain a +1 bonus to surprise rolls when in the wilderness. When using the Adventuring proficiency, to search or listen, they succeed on a proficiency throw of 14+ (instead of the usual 18+). If separately proficient in Searching they gain a +2 bonus to their throw instead. If separately proficient in Listening, they gain a +4 bonus to their throw instead.

**Connection to Nature:** Because of their **connection to nature**, elves are completely unaffected by diseases caused by undead, and gain a +1 bonus to Paralysis and Spells saving throws. Their robust vitality grants a +1 bonus to their HD roll at 1st level. (These adjustments are already factored into their HD and saving throws on the tables.)

**Elf Tongues:** Elves can speak the Common, Elven, Gnoll, Hobgoblin, and Orc languages.

### Class Proficiencies

**Proficiency Progression:** At 1st level, spellswords select one class proficiency from their class proficiency list and one general proficiency from the general proficiency list. They select an additional class proficiency at 3rd, 6th, and 9th level. They select an additional general proficiency at 5th and 9th level.

**Notes:** Most characters of this class have above average Intellect, and the templates above reflect that. Each template assumes that the character has an INT attribute of between 13 and 15, qualifying him for one bonus proficiency and one bonus spell. The bonus proficiency and bonus spell that each template begins with are noted last. For characters with INT of less than 13 or greater than 15, see the **Intellect Scores of Studious Spellcasters** section earlier in this Chapter.

The Flametongue can choose to replace the fire spells with one of three alternative spell selections available, one for each element:

* Air: *thunderclap*and *wall**of**smoke*
* Earth: *earth's**excrescence*and *shatter blade*
* Water: *desiccate*and *slickness*

The winged knight's eagle familiar grants him Command proficiency. The eagle feather wings on the winged knight's banded plate armor are purely decorative. They do not actually grant the character the power to fly.
