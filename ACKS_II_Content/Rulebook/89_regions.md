## Regions

Military campaigns take place within **regions**, consisting of several domains or realms. Regions should be mapped on sheets of hex graph paper beforehand, so that the Judge knows the layout of the land. The **regional map** should show the terrain type in each hex, and indicate the location of major domains, urban settlements, navigable waterways, and roads.

***ACKS****-*compatiblemedium region hex paper, available for free download at [www.autarch.co](http://www.autarch.co), is ideal for regional maps. This hex paper is 32 6-mile hexes wide and 48 6-mile hexes long. A set of larger 24-mile hexes, 8 wide and 12 long, are superimposed on top for easy reference. The medium region map is sufficient for a principality or portion of a kingdom. Larger regions can be plotted by adjusting the scale upwards so that each small hex equals 24 miles.
