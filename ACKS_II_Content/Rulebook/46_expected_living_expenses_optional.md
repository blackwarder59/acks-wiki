## Expected Living Expenses (Optional)

In the world of the Auran Empire, wealth is measured by what you spend, not what you save. To gain prestige, reputation, and respect, an up-and-coming adventurer should spend money appropriate to his position. The NPCs certainly will!

###### Abstract Living Expenses

An adventurer’s expected living expenses each month are equal to the wages of a henchmen of the same level. These funds are due at the end of each game month. Adventurers who do not spend at least this much each month are considered to be of lower level (equivalent to what they do spend) by NPCs in the world, including current and prospective henchmen.

###### Concrete Living Expenses

Sometimes it matters exactly what the money goes towards. The following in-game expenses can be applied against living expenses. No individual expense can count as more than half the total expenditure.

* Cost of renting a specific in-game location, or an implicit rent of 1/33 the gp value of a stronghold or home
* Cost of any number of artists, craftsmen, laborers, performers, or professionals, employed for personal and household use
* Cost of any animal trainers employed for ordinary animals
* Cost of any servants for personal and household use
* Cost of stabling or feed for 1 warhorse per class level, for personal and household use
* Cost of stabling or feed for up to 6 hunting dogs per class level, for personal and household use
* Cost of charitable or civic donations
* Cost of food, drink, or entertainment during a game session

The following in-game expenses cannot be counted as living expenses:

* Cost of weapons and armor
* Cost of adventuring gear
* Cost of magic items, identification, and spells cast
* Cost of mercenaries and ruffians
* Cost of henchmen
* Cost of liturgies applied towards domain morale
* Cost of excessive spending applied as reserve XP

EXAMPLE: A 9th level adventurer has living expenses of 7,250gp per month. He rents a 100,000gp villa for 3,000gp per month. He staffs his villa with 20 household servants (3gp each, 60gp total), a kennel master (animal trainer — domestic, 25gp), a stable master (animal trainer — domestic, 25gp), a personal physician (healer rank 3, 100gp), and personal tailor with journeymen and apprentices (150gp). He maintains a concubine in luxury (1,000gp) and is the patron of a master poet (75gp per month). He stables and feeds a warhorse (30gp) and six hunting dogs (6gp). He spends 1,000gp each month sponsoring gladiatorial games for the people. The remaining 1,779gp he spends on food, drink, baubles, and entertainment for himself and his companions.
