# Chapter 12: Sieges

A **siege** is an attempt to capture a garrisoned **stronghold** or **urban settlement**. The army laying siege is known as the **besieging army** or besieger, while the army garrisoning the stronghold is the **defending army** or defender. Hereafter, any reference to “strongholds” is inclusive of urban settlements unless otherwise noted.
