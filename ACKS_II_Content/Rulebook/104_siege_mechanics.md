## Siege Mechanics

***ACKS II***uses the **structural hit points (shp)** and **unit capacity** of strongholds to resolve the outcome of sieges. See Chapter 4, **Structures** (p. XX) for a list of shp and unit capacity by structure type.

Calculating a stronghold’s structural hit points simply requires adding up the shp of the walls and buildings that make up of the structure. Calculating a stronghold’s unit capacity likewise requires adding up the number of units that the stronghold can contain.

EXAMPLE: Moruvai’s stronghold falls under siege by Marcus. Moruvai’s stronghold consists of a keep (15,000 shp, unit capacity 12); 4 medium towers (1,000 shp, unit capacity 1 each); and 4 100’ lengths of wall (1,500 shp and unit capacity 2 each). The stronghold has 25,000 shp and unit capacity 24.

Unit capacity and structural hit points interact to determine how many units can assault and defend a stronghold. For every point of unit capacity, a stronghold can be assaulted and defended by 1 unit. For each 1,000 shp of damage dealt, a **breach** is created that permits another unit to join the assault.

| **Effect of Unit Capacity and Structural Hit Points** | |
| Unit Capacity | For each point, a stronghold can be assaulted and defended by 1 unit |
| Structural Hit Points | For each breach (1,000 shp of damage) 1 additional unit can assault the stronghold |

Thus, any attempt to assault an undamaged stronghold will put assaulting units up against defending units at a 1:1 ratio. Since a unit defending a stronghold has significant advantages over a unit assaulting a stronghold, a fully-garrisoned and undamaged stronghold is very, very hard to capture. In order to overcome the defending army’s initial advantage, the besieging army must reduce the stronghold’s defenses. The gradual creation of breaches to allow for a successful assault is the core of siege warfare in ***ACKS****.*

EXAMPLE: As the siege begins, Moruvai’s keep has a unit capacity of 24. If Marcus were to assault immediately, he could assault with 24 units and Moruvai could defend with 24 units. Instead, Marcus patiently bombards Moruvai’s stronghold for several weeks, dealing 15,000 shp of damage. That’s 15 breaches! Now Marcus can assault with (24 + 15) 39 units, while Moruvai can still only defend with 24 units.
