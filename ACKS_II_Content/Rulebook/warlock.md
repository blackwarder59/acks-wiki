# Warlock

Key Attribute: INT and CHA

Requirements: None

Hit Dice: 1d4

Maximum Level: 14

Warlocks are arcane spellcasters who have made pacts with otherworldly entities to gain magical power. Unlike mages who study magic through books and research, warlocks gain their power through bargains with demons, devils, fey lords, or other supernatural patrons. This power comes at a price, and many warlocks struggle with the demands and influence of their otherworldly masters.

## Combat Characteristics

Warlocks are poor combatants, focusing their efforts on magical studies and otherworldly communion. They rely heavily on their spells and supernatural abilities for protection.

**Combat Proficiencies:** Warlocks have weapon proficiency with crossbows, daggers, darts, oil, slings, staves, and any weapons granted by their patron. They have armor proficiency with light armor. They have no fighting style proficiencies.

**Combat Progression:** Warlocks advance in attack throws and saving throws as mages, by one point every three levels of experience. Warlocks increase their base damage roll from successful missile and melee attacks by +1 at 1st level and by an additional +1 at 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th level.

## Magic

Warlocks are arcane spellcasters who receive their magic from their otherworldly patron. Their magic tends to be more limited than a mage's but comes with unique supernatural abilities.

**Spell Acquisition:** Warlocks acquire spells through their pact with their patron. They do not use spell books in the traditional sense, but may maintain a grimoire recording their pact terms and invocations. Unlike mages, warlocks have a limited selection of spells available to them, determined by their patron and the Judge. Each warlock knows a number of spells of each level equal to the number shown on the **Warlock Spell Progression** table, but cannot learn additional spells by research or discovery. Warlocks can cast 1st level spells from 1st level.

**Spell Slots:** A warlock's spell-casting ability is summarized on the **Warlock Spell Progression** table. That table shows the number of spell slots available at each class level, according to the level of the spell. A 1st level warlock can cast one 1st level spell per day, while a 14th level warlock can cast five 1st level spells, five 2nd level spells, four 3rd level spells, four 4th level spells, four 5th level spells, and three 6th level spells per day.

**Spell Casting:** Warlocks must have their hands free to cast spells. Warlocks cannot cast arcane spells while wearing armor heavier than light armor. Warlocks may cast spells from a spell scroll of arcane spells with a proficiency throw of 10+ (adding the spell level to this throw).

**Spell List:** The list of spells available to warlocks can be found at the end of this chapter. Each warlock's available spells are determined by their patron.

**Restoring Magic:** Warlocks regain their ability to cast spells through communion with their patron. They must spend at least 4 hours in meditation or ritual contact with their otherworldly master to recover their spell slots.

## Starting Class Powers

At the start of play, warlocks have the class powers below:

**Otherworldly Patron:** Every warlock has made a pact with a supernatural entity. Common patron types include:
- **Archfiend:** A powerful demon or devil (grants fire resistance and intimidation bonuses)
- **Archfey:** A lord or lady of the Seelie or Unseelie courts (grants charm resistance and nature bonuses)
- **Great Old One:** An alien entity from beyond reality (grants telepathy and madness resistance)
- **Elemental Lord:** A powerful elemental prince (grants elemental resistance and control)

The patron's nature affects the warlock's available spells and some class powers.

**Eldritch Blast:** A warlock can unleash a blast of magical energy at will. This is a ranged attack with a range of 120 feet that deals 1d6 damage. The damage increases to 1d8 at 5th level, 1d10 at 9th level, and 1d12 at 13th level. This ability can be used at will and does not count against spell slots.

**Patron's Mark:** The warlock bears a supernatural mark of their pact, visible to those with magical sight. This mark grants a +2 bonus to one type of saving throw (determined by patron type) but also makes the warlock easily identifiable to other supernatural entities.

**Supernatural Resistance:** Warlocks gain resistance to one type of damage or effect based on their patron (fire for fiends, charm for fey, psychic for aberrants, etc.). This grants a +2 bonus to saving throws against such effects and reduces damage by 1 point per die.

## Additional Class Powers

When they advance in level, warlocks gain the following additional class powers:

**Improved Eldritch Blast (3rd level):** The warlock can invoke their blast with additional effects based on their patron:
- **Archfiend:** Blast sets target on fire for 1 additional damage per round
- **Archfey:** Blast can push target back 10 feet
- **Great Old One:** Blast can frighten target for 1 round
- **Elemental Lord:** Blast gains elemental properties based on patron

**Patron's Boon (5th level):** The warlock gains a special benefit from their patron:
- **Archfiend:** Once per day, summon a lesser demon to serve for 1 hour
- **Archfey:** Once per day, step through the Fey realm to teleport up to 1 mile
- **Great Old One:** Once per day, read thoughts as the spell
- **Elemental Lord:** Once per day, transform into an elemental for 1 turn

**Dark Sanctuary (9th level):** By establishing a **dark sanctuary** worth at least 15,000gp, the warlock can attract followers and gain a base of operations connected to their patron's realm. 1d6 1st level warlocks and 1d3 cultists will arrive to serve within 1d6 weeks. The sanctuary also serves as a conduit for the patron's influence. Additional rules for dark sanctuaries are detailed in the **Campaigns** chapter.

**Avatar of the Patron (13th level):** Once per week, the warlock can temporarily channel their patron's power directly. For 10 minutes, the warlock gains:
- +4 bonus to all attack throws and saving throws
- Immunity to effects their patron is immune to
- Access to one additional spell of any level per round
- The ability to use their eldritch blast as a free action
- An aura of supernatural dread (enemies within 30 feet must save vs. spells or flee)

## Class Proficiencies

**Proficiency Progression:** At 1st level, warlocks select one class proficiency from their class proficiency list and one general proficiency from the general proficiency list. They select an additional class proficiency at 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th level. They select an additional general proficiency at 5th, 9th, and 13th level.

**Warlock Proficiency List:** Alchemy, Art (any), Bargaining, Ceremonial Magic, Diplomacy, Intimidation, Knowledge, Language, Lore, Magical Engineering, Mapping, Mystic Aura, Performance, Prestidigitation, Profession (any), Soothsaying, Theology
