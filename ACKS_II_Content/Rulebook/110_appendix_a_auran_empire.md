# Appendix A: Auran Empire

Welcome to a world of adventure, where a once-majestic empire is slipping into oblivion, and bold and ambitious conquerors are rising to forge new realms from the ashes of the old. This Appendix summarizes the information that a well-educated Auran patrician would know about his world. The ***AX*** line of adventure scenarios and various articles in ***Axioms***magazine, all available separately from Autarch, provide more detail about the setting, but this should be enough to get you started!
