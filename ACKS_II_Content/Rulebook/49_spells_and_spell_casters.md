## Spells and Spell Casters

Spells can be cast only by characters of special classes, collectively called **spellcasters** or **casters**. When a caster casts a spell, he taps into a source of magical power and then channels that power into a specific supernatural effect. The specific effect is controlled by a combination of hand gestures and spoken incantations that specify the desired result. If the gestures and incantations are interrupted, the tapped power is wastefully diffused rather than properly channeled, so the effect does not occur.

The source of magical power that is tapped is determined by the type of magic. There are two **magic types** described in this book: **arcane** and **divine**. Other types of magic, such as **eldritch**, have been detailed in other ***ACKS***sourcebooks. Arcane casters tap the ambient power that suffuses the cosmos. Divine casters tap the power of immortal deities or ancestral spirits whom they venerate. Both types of casters draw on their own personal power to channel the external power they receive. Inexperienced casters quickly deplete their personal power and find themselves unable to continue to cast spells. Experienced casters develop greater reservoirs of personal power that enable them to cast spells more frequently.

Like characters, spells have **levels** that measure how powerful they are. For instance, some spells are 1st level spells, and some are 2nd level, and so on. Lower level characters can learn and cast only lower level spells, while higher level characters can access more powerful, higher level spells.

The divine spellcasters described in this rule book are crusaders, bladedancers, dwarven craftpriests, Nobiran wonderworkers, priestesses, shamans, and witches. The arcane spellcasters are mages, elven nightblades, elven spellswords, Nobiran wonderworkers, warlocks, and Zaharan ruinguards. Some rules will apply only to one type of caster, or even just to one class, while others apply to all classes and all types. If a rule does not specify a particular type of spellcaster, it applies to all classes and all types of spellcasters.

###### Castings per Day

During any single day, spellcasters can cast the number of spells of each level indicated on the Spells Progression table for their class. Unlike other fantasy games, in the ***Adventurer Conqueror King System****,* spellcasters do not have to “memorize” or “prepare” their spells in advance; they can choose which spells to cast at the time of casting from among any and all the spells in their **repertoire** (see below).

Once a caster has cast all of his available spells, he has exhausted his personal power and cannot continue to cast spells. The number of castings available to the caster refreshes each time the caster enjoys 8 hours of restful sleep. A caster cannot enjoy more than 8 hours of restful sleep in any 24-hour period.

###### Casting Requirements

All spellcasters need to be able to move their hands and speak in order to make the gestures and say the incantations that bring magic effects into being. As a result, a spellcaster cannot cast spells if he is gagged, his hands are tied, or he is in an area under the effects of a **noiselessness** spell.

Casting a spell takes one round of game time. A caster cannot take any other actions during the round he casts a spell. As described in the **Initiative** section of Chapter 6,a caster must announce the intention to cast a spell prior to initiative being determined at the beginning of a round. If the caster takes damage or fails a saving throw that round before the spell is cast, the spell is disrupted and fails. The spell still counts against the caster’s spells per day as if it had been cast, and the caster loses his action for the round.

Some spells require other conditions be met before they can be cast. For instance, some spells might require the caster to touch the target, others might require that the caster be outdoors or near a fire. Each spell’s description will list these conditions, if any apply.
