# Venturer

Key Attribute: CHA

Requirements: None

Hit Dice: 1d6

Maximum Level: 14

The Venturer class represents charismatic leaders, merchant-princes, and aristocratic nobles. Sometimes called bards, venturers are skilled in diplomacy, trade, and leadership. While not as combat-capable as fighters or as magically potent as mages, venturers excel at building organizations, leading followers, and accomplishing their goals through cunning and charisma. In the Auran Empire, a venturer might be a noble senator, a prosperous merchant, a traveling bard, or an ambitious upstart seeking wealth and power.

## Combat Characteristics

Venturers are competent combatants, though they rely more on cunning and leadership than raw martial prowess. They are the most flexible of the core classes when it comes to weapons and armor.

**Combat Proficiencies:** Venturers have weapon proficiency with all tiny, small, and medium weapons (melee and missile). They have armor proficiency with light armor and very light armor. They have fighting style proficiency with all three fighting styles: dual weapon, two-handed weapon, and weapon and shield.

**Combat Progression:** Venturers advance in attack throws and saving throws by two points every four levels of experience. They gain a bonus to damage as they advance in level, as shown on the Venturer Level Progression table. They can cleave after killing a foe a maximum of once per round per every two class levels (rounded down).

## Starting Class Powers

At the start of play, venturers have the following class powers.

**Adventuring:** The venturer is able to research opportunities for extraordinary adventures — exploring ruins, seeking lost treasures, hunting monsters, and so on. The rules for researching adventures can be found in the **Adventures** chapter (p. XX). When on an adventure, the venturer and any henchmen and hirelings earn double the normal XP from treasure.

**Black Market Contacts:** The venturer has contacts in the gray and black markets where contraband, illegal, or heavily regulated goods are bought and sold. When in a city, the venturer can attempt to find black market contacts using the procedure for hirelings and henchmen, but hiring black marketeers costs 100% more than the standard rate. However, black marketeers offer their services in disreputable taverns, not guildhalls, so the venturer pays no guild fees for their hiring. Once per month in any particular city, the venturer can also attempt to locate contraband for sale, or seek to sell contraband, with a proficiency throw of 11+. The availability and price of contraband is subject to the Judge's discretion.

**Diplomacy:** The venturer is skilled in negotiation, mediation, and statecraft. Once per month, the venturer can attempt to change the reaction roll of any one intelligent creature or NPC by one category (e.g. from Hostile to Unfriendly). Doing so requires 2d6 days of negotiation, and a proficiency throw of 11+. The Judge should modify this proficiency throw by +4 if the creature is the same social class, race, and culture as the venturer, by +2 if any two apply, by 0 if one applies, and by -4 if none applies. Reactions may be more or less difficult to shift, depending on circumstances and past history, at the Judge's discretion. (This class power is equivalent to one rank of Diplomacy proficiency.)

**Government Connections:** The venturer begins the game with ties to either official authority or an organized group of rebels against authority. He can begin play as a member of the nobility, adventurers' guild, civil administration, or other organization (Judge's discretion). He can automatically recognize and identify government agents, symbols, patrols, and procedures in his home settlement, and can recognize those of other regions with a proficiency throw of 11+. (This class power is equivalent to one rank of Bureaucracy proficiency.)

**Inspiring Leadership:** The venturer's heroic charisma enables him to inspire others to acts of bravery. Any henchmen and hirelings of the venturer gain a +1 bonus to their morale score and a +1 bonus on saving throws to resist charm, command, fear, or other enchantments when the venturer is present and able to issue commands. At 3rd level, the bonus increases to +2. At 7th level, the bonus increases to +3. At 11th level, the bonus increases to +4.

**Investment:** The venturer can hire specialists and invest in profitable businesses. Each month, he can make a number of investments equal to his class level. The procedure for making investments is detailed in the **Campaigns** chapter (p. XX).

**Mercantile Ventures:** The venturer can organize and profit from trading expeditions. The rules for mercantile ventures can be found in the **Campaigns** chapter (p. XX).

**Retainer Appeal:** The venturer is especially adept at recruiting and retaining followers. The maximum number of henchmen a venturer can have is equal to 4 plus his Charisma bonus. This is in addition to the normal rules for determining the maximum number of henchmen (p. XX).

## Additional Class Powers

When they advance in level, venturers gain the following additional class powers:

**Bribery (3rd level):** The venturer learns the subtleties of bribery and can attempt to bribe one official or leader per month. The base chance of a successful bribe is 11+ on 1d20. This proficiency throw is modified by the Charisma bonus of the venturer and the relative difference in level or HD between the venturer and the target (e.g. +1 if the venturer is 1 level higher, -3 if the target is 3 HD higher). Additional modifiers may apply depending on local laws, customs, how much money is offered, and the circumstances. (This class power is equivalent to one rank of Bribery proficiency.)

**Enterprise (9th level):** By acquiring an **enterprise** worth at least 10,000gp, the venturer can become a successful trader and leader of a commercial enterprise. Detailed rules for enterprises are found in the **Campaigns** chapter (p. XX). Once he has an enterprise, the venturer can attract a number of 0th level mercenaries equal to 50 times his level to serve him, plus a number of 1st-3rd level lieutenants equal to his level. The followers arrive over the course of 1d6 months after the enterprise is established.

**Regional Influence (11th level):** The venturer's success grants him influence with the regional authorities. He may use his regional influence to call upon military formations, exert political pressure, or otherwise flex the muscle of the local power structure. The scope of his influence depends on his role in society (see **Campaigns** chapter, p. XX).
