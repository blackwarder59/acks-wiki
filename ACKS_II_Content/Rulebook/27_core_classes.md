### Fighter

Key Attribute: STR

Requirements: None

Hit Dice: 1d8

Maximum Level: 14

Fighters are experts in the arts of combat and war. In the Auran Empire, fighters might have learned their arts as legionaries or cataphracts in the Imperial Army, gladiators battling for glory in the arena, raiders off the Jutland coast, or sell-swords in the games of the noble houses.

###### Combat Characteristics

As their name suggests, fighters are exceptionally skilled combatants. No other class is as broadly trained in the arts of combat.

**Combat Proficiencies:** Fighters have weapon proficiency with all weapons, armor proficiency with all armor, and fighting style proficiency with all three optional styles (i.e. the dual weapon, two-handed weapon, and weaponand shield styles).

**Combat Progression:** Fighters advance in attack throws and saving throws by two points every three levels of experience. They increase their base damage roll from successful missile and melee attacks by +1 at 1st level, and by an additional +1 at 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th level. They can cleave after killing a foe a maximum of once per round per class level.

| 14 | 4+ | 5+ | 6+ | 7+ | 8+ | 1+ |

###### Starting Class Powers

At the start of play, fighters have the following class power:

**Manual of Arms:** The fighter is highly experienced in military discipline, physical fitness, and weapon drill. He can automatically identify the battle standards, equipment, great captains, military slang, and rank insignia of his homeland. He can identify those of other realms with a proficiency throw of 11+. He can fight as a regular (rather than irregular) in formed and loose units. He can begin play as a member of a legion, mercenary’s guild, or other military organization (Judge’s discretion). (This class power is equivalent to one rank of Manual of Arms proficiency.)

###### Additional Class Powers

When they advance in level, fighters gain the following additional class powers:

**Battlefield Prowess (5th level):** The fighter’s presence inspires troops he leads. Any henchmen and mercenaries hired by the fighter gain a +1 bonus to their morale score whenever he personally leads them. This bonus stacks with any modifiers from the fighter’s Charisma or proficiencies.

**Castle (9th level):** By acquiring a **castle** or fort worth at least 15,000gp, the fighter can attract followers to his service. 5d6 x 10 0th level troops and 1d6 fighters of 1st – 3rd level arrive to serve him within 1d3 months of him acquiring the castle. If the fighter already has a castle, the followers arrive to serve him within 1d3 months of him reaching 9th level. The fighter must pay his followers the ordinary rates for mercenaries and henchmen or they leave his service. In time, the fighter might become a great lord, commanding armies to conquer vast realms. Additional rules for castles are detailed in the **Campaigns** chapter (p. XX).

###### Class Proficiencies

**Proficiency Progression:** At 1st level, fighters select one class proficiency from their class proficiency list and one general proficiency from the general proficiency list. They select an additional class proficiency at 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th level. They select an additional general proficiency at 5th, 9th, and 13th level.

**Fighter Proficiency List:** Acrobatics, Alertness, Berserkergang, Blind Fighting, Combat Ferocity, Combat Reflexes, Combat Trickery (disarm, force back, knock down, overrun, sunder), Command, Dungeonbashing Expertise, Fighting Style Specialization, Intimidation, Leadership, Manual of Arms, Military Strategy, Mounted Combat, Precise Shooting, Riding, Running, Siege Engineering, Skirmishing, Swashbuckling, Unarmed Fighting, Weapon Finesse, Weapon Focus

### Explorer

Key Attribute: CON

Requirements: None

Hit Dice: 1d6

Maximum Level: 14

Explorers are scouts, settlers, and surveyors hardened to the challenges of the wild. Few adventuring parties would dare the wilderness without an experienced explorer to guide them. Within the Auran Empire, an explorer might be an Imperial scout from the Legions, a barbarian hunter from the northern forests of Jutland, or a settler pushing past the borders of the Empire.

| 850,000 | Lord Warden | 14 | 9d6 + 10\* | +5 |
| \*No adjustment from Constitution applies to this flat bonus. | | | | |

###### Combat Characteristics

Because weapons and armor are cumbersome and exhausting on long journeys, explorers tend to stay lightly equipped and prefer to evade foes where possible. That said, many fighters have underestimated explorers to their peril, for they are skilled archers and warriors when they need to be.

**Combat Proficiencies:** Explorers have weapon proficiency with all missile weapons and with all tiny, small, and medium melee weapons. They have armor proficiency with medium, light, and very light armor. They have fighting style proficiency with all three optional styles (i.e. the dual weapon, two-handed weapon, and weapon and shield styles).

**Combat Progression:** Like fighters, explorers advance in attack throws and saving throws by two points every three levels of experience. They increase their base damage roll from successful missile and melee attacks by +1 at 1st level, and by an additional +1 at 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th level. They can cleave after killing a foe a maximum of once per round per class level.

| 13 | 5+ | 6+ | 7+ | 8+ | 9+ | 2+ |
| 14 | 4+ | 5+ | 6+ | 7+ | 8+ | 1+ |

###### Starting Class Powers

At the start of play, explorers have the following class powers. Some of the explorer’s powers require him to be in familiar territory. At 1st level, an explorer is considered familiar with the settled territory of his starting region as well as unsettled territory within one 24-mile hex radius of settled territories. With each additional level of experience, the radius increases one 24-mile hex further from settled territory.

**Alertness:** Explorers are always alert to danger.An explorer gains a +1 bonus to avoid surprise. When using Adventuring proficiency to search or listen, he succeeds on a proficiency throw of 14+ (instead of the usual 18+). If separately proficient in Searching or Listening, he gains a +2 bonus to his throw instead.

**Ambushing:** Explorers are skilled at ambushing unprepared enemies. An explorer can ambush any **vulnerable** opponent. Ambushes can be made in melee or with missile weapons at short range, but cannot be made with missile weapons at medium or longer range. When ambushing, an explorer gets a +4 bonus on his attack throws and deals an extra die of damage on the attack. (This class power is the equivalent of Ambushing proficiency.)

**Animal Reflexes:** Explorers react to danger as fast as a deer to a wolf. An explorer gains a +1 bonus to initiative and a +1 bonus to avoid surprise. (This bonus stacks with the bonus from Alertness, so in most cases explorers have a +2 bonus to avoid surprise.)

**Endurance**: Explorers are inured to the hardship and fatigue of travel. When exploring, an explorer does not need to rest every 6 turns. An explorer can force march for one day without penalty, plus one additional day for each point of Constitution bonus. (This class power is equivalent to Endurance proficiency.)

**Evasion:** Explorers learn to avoid the wild beasts of the wilderness. When the explorer guides the party in familiar territory, the party gains a +5 bonus to proficiency throws to evade wilderness encounters. The explorer’s party can evade wilderness encounters even when **surprised** provided the explorer is not surprised. See **Evasion** (p. xx) for more details on evading encounters.

**Pathfinding:** Explorers rarely lose their bearings, even in trackless wilderness. When the explorer guides a party in familiar territory, the party gains a +4 bonus on proficiency throws to avoid getting lost. See **Wilderness Expeditions** section of Chapter 6 (p. XX) for more details on getting lost.

**Natural Stealth:** As hunters and wilderness scouts, explorers are naturally sneaky. Opponents suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls when encountering an explorer approaching from outside line of sight or lying in wait in cover or darkness.

###### Additional Class Powers

When they advance in level, explorers gain the following additional class powers:

**Experience and Hardiness (5th level):** When an explorer reaches 5th level (Guide), his experience and hardiness reassure those who follow him into the wild. Hirelings on a wilderness adventure led by the explorer gain a +1 bonus to their morale score. This bonus stacks with any modifiers from Charisma or proficiencies.

**Border Fort (9th level):** By acquiring a **border fort** worth at least 15,000gp, the explorer can attract followers to his service. 5d6 x 10 0th level troops and 1d6 explorers of 1st – 3rd level arrive to serve him within 1d3 months of him acquiring the border fort. If the explorer already has a border fort, the followers arrive to serve him within 1d3 months of him reaching 9th level. The explorer must pay his followers the ordinary rates for mercenaries and henchmen or they leave his service. In time, the explorer might become the warden of a flourishing colony. In order for a stronghold to count as a border fort, it must be constructed in outlands or unsettled territory. An explorer within 24 miles of a domain secured by his border fort never becomes lost and gains an additional +4 bonus to evade encounters because of his familiarity with the region. Additional rules for border forts are detailed in the **Campaigns** chapter (p. XX).

###### Class Proficiencies

**Proficiency Progression:** At 1st level, explorers select one class proficiency from their class proficiency list and one general proficiency from the general proficiency list. They select an additional class proficiency at 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th level. They select an additional general proficiency at 5th, 9th, and 13th level.

**Explorer Proficiency List:** Beast Friendship, Climbing, Combat Ferocity, Combat Reflexes, Combat Trickery (disarm, knock down), Driving, Eavesdropping, Elven Bloodline, Fighting Style Specialization, Illusion Resistance, Land Surveying, Mapping, Mountaineering, Mounted Combat, Naturalism, Navigation, Passing Without Trace, Precise Shooting, Prospecting, Riding, Running, Seafaring, Skirmishing, Sniping, Swashbuckling, Trapping, Weapon Finesse, Weapon Focus

### Thief

Key Attribute: DEX

Requirements: None

Hit Dice: 1d4

Maximum Level: 14

Where other classes rely on their valor in battle or power with magic, thieves rely on cunning, stealth, and subterfuge. Sometimes a thief will belong to an organized criminal syndicate from the character’s local town, where he can seek shelter and information between adventures. However, many adventuring thieves are independent of any guild, and some even refuse to call themselves thieves at all — preferring terms such as expert treasure hunter, gentleman adventurer, or dungeoneer. In the Auran Empire, thieves are everywhere, from the slums of the ports of Kushtu to the highest halls of the Senate in Aura.

| \*No adjustment from Constitution applies to this flat bonus. | | | | |

###### Combat Characteristics

Thieves are trained combatants, although not as skilled as fighters. Because of their need of stealth and free movement, they tend to be lightly equipped and not sufficiently armored to endure a stand-up fight.

**Combat Proficiencies:** Thieves have weapon proficiency with all missile weapons and with all tiny, small, and medium melee weapons. They have armor proficiency with light and very light armor. They have fighting style proficiency with the dual weapon and two-handed weapon styles, but not with the weapon and shield style.

**Combat Progression:** Thieves advance in attack throws and saving throws by two points every four levels of experience. They do not gain any bonus to damage as they advance in level. They can cleave after killing a foe a maximum of once per round per every two class levels (rounded down).

###### Starting Class Powers

Certain of the thief’s class powers, known as his **thief skills**, improve like attack throws and saving throws as the thief gains levels. The progression for each thief skill is shown on the Thief Skills table below. Each thief skill has special rules that apply to it, described in the entry for that class power.

| 14 | -7+ | -2+ | 1+ | -3+ | -4+ | -3+ | -4+ | 1+ |

**Backstabbing:** Thieves are skilled at treacherously attacking unprepared enemies. A thief can backstab any **vulnerable** opponent. Backstabs can be made in melee or with missile weapons at short range, but cannot be made with missile weapons at medium or longer range. When backstabbing, a thief gains a +4 bonus to hit and if the attack succeeds, the thief deals an additional die of damage at 1st level, and another additional die at 5th, 9th, and 13th level.

**Climbing:** Thieves are adept at scaling sheer surfaces, including smooth walls or steep cliffs. The thief must make a Climbing proficiency throw for each 100’ climbed (with a minimum of one check required). If the throw succeeds, the thief can safely ascend or descend the distance. If the throw fails, the thief falls a distance equal to half the attempted distance, plus the distance covered by any previous throws, taking 1d6 bludgeoning damage per 10 feet. A thief can climb at his exploration speed or one-third his combat speed without penalty. If he moves at one-half combat speed, he takes a -5 penalty to the proficiency throw, and if he moves at full combat speed, he takes a -10 penalty. For further rules on climbing, see p. XX.

**Hiding:** Thieves are trained to skulk unseen in the cover of darkness. A thief can begin hiding as a combat action anytime he is in cover, dim light, or darkness. When the thief begins hiding, the Judge must make a Hiding proficiency throw on behalf of the thief. A thief will always think he is successful in this skill, and will not know otherwise until others react to his presence. Regardless of whether the throw succeeds, opponents encountering the thief suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls as long as he remains stationary in cover, dim light, or darkness.

If the throw succeeds, the thief is **hidden**. If the throw fails, the thief is not hidden. No creature can claim line of sight on a thief that is hidden from it. If a hidden thief engages an unengaged opponent, the opponent cannot make a free facing change (p. XX). If an opponent knows the hidden thief’s general location, the opponent can attack him in melee at a -4 penalty, but it cannot even blindly attack the thief if it doesn’t knows his general location. The hidden condition expires at the end of the thief’s initiative if he moves or attacks. It also terminates if the cover, dim light, or darkness no longer conceals the thief from his opponents.

**Listening:** Thieves at doors, passageways, or intersections can listen for sounds coming from the other side of the door or passage. The Judge makes a Listening proficiency throw in secret on behalf of the thief. If the throw succeeds, he hears any noises in earshot. If the throw fails, or if there aren’t any noises in earshot, he doesn’t hear anything. The thief must be quiet and must be the closest creature in the party relative to the location of the sound or suspected sound. Listening only requires one round but can only be undertaken once per turn if the party is moving at all, because it takes time for people to settle down into quiet.

**Lockpicking:** With the aid of thieves’ tools, a thief can pick mechanical locks. A thief can pick locks either hastily or methodically.

* Attempting to hastily pick a lock requires one round and a Lockpicking proficiency throw. If the throw succeeds, the lock is opened. If it fails on a natural roll of 1 – 3, the thief breaks his pick in the lock, jamming it. The lock cannot thereafter be picked. If it fails on any other result, the thief cannot figure out how to quickly open the lock. He can still attempt to open it methodically, but cannot make another attempt to hastily pick the same lock again until he reaches a higher experience level.
* Attempting to methodically pick a lock requires one turn (10 minutes) and a Lockpicking proficiency throw with a +4 bonus. If the throw succeeds, the lock is opened. If it fails on a natural roll of 1, the thief breaks his pick in the lock, jamming it. The lock cannot thereafter be picked. If it fails on any other result, the thief fails to pick the lock, but can make another methodical attempt if desired.

Other bonuses or penalties might apply to the throw, depending on the thief’s tools, the complexity of the lock, and other factors.

**Pickpocketing:** The thief is practiced in the art of picking pockets and cutting purses. To use this skill, the thief must move within 5’ of his target and make a Pickpocketing proficiency throw. If the target is unaware of the thief, the thief gains a +4 bonus to the throw. If the throw succeeds, the target can be robbed of the contents of one pocket, or any one item or tiny or small weapon hung on his person (but not a held item or weapon). If the throw fails, the thief fails to pickpocket the target. If the throw fails, and the roll is a natural roll of 1 or less than half the target value, the intended target notices the thieving attempt. The Judge will then make a reaction roll with a -3 penalty to determine the intended victim’s reaction.

**Searching:** Through careful inspection and probing of his surroundings, a thief can find concealed traps, secret doors, obscured objects, buried treasure, and other hidden features. A thief can attempt to search for hidden features either hastily or methodically.

* Attempting to hastily search requires one round and a Searching proficiency throw. The Judge makes the throw in secret on behalf of the thief. If the throw succeeds, the thief notices any hidden features within 5’ of his location. If it fails, or there is nothing hidden, the thief finds nothing. The thief cannot make another attempt to hastily search the same area again until he reaches a higher experience level, but he can attempt to methodically search the location.
* Attempting to methodically search requires one turn (10 minutes) and a Searching proficiency throw with a +4 bonus. The Judge makes the throw in secret on behalf of the thief. If the throw succeeds, the thief notices any hidden features within 5’ of his location. If the throw fails, or there is nothing hidden, the thief finds nothing. The thief can make repeated attempts to methodically search a location if desired.

When a thief is moving at exploration speed, he can choose to attempt to hastily search as he moves. If so, then anytime the thief moves within 5’ of a hidden feature, the Judge secretly makes a proficiency throw on his behalf. If the throw succeeds, the thief notices it (and if it’s a trap, he notices it before triggering it). If the throw fails, the thief does not notice anything (and, if it’s a trap, he or another character in the party might trigger it as they move). Note that this counts as a failure to hastily search for hidden features.

If the thief is equipped with a long pole or similar implement, he can search a 5’ radius area within 10’ of his location. This can be advantageous because if a trap gets set off, he might be far enough to avoid being harmed. Other rules, bonuses or penalties might apply to the attempt, depending on the thief’s tools, the degree of concealment, and other factors.

**Shadowy Senses:** Since the bright light of torches will reveal their positions, thieves learn to rely on superior night-vision, keen hearing and smell, and echolocation to slowly scout through dark alleys, lightless dungeons, and star-lit rooftops. When moving at combat speed or exploration speed, a thief can “see” as if he were carrying a light source that sheds dim light in a 30’ radius. Shadowy senses can be used to fight, probe for traps, and so on. However, shadowy senses cannot be used to discern colors, faces, markings, or flat images (such as frescoes and murals), or to read books, maps, or scrolls. Shadowy senses does not function if the thief is charging or running, if deafened, or if in an area of bright light, magical darkness, or magical silence. Because it counts as dim light, an opponent can hide from shadowy senses.

**Sneaking:** Thieves learn to prowl with great stealth. A thief can begin sneaking as a movement action. He can sneak at his encounter speed or one-half combat speed without penalty. If he moves greater than one-half combat speed, he takes a -5 penalty to the Sneaking proficiency throw. If he runs, he takes a -10 penalty.

When the thief begins sneaking, the Judge must make a Sneaking proficiency throw on behalf of the thief. A thief will always think he is successful in this skill, and will not know otherwise until others react to his presence. Regardless of whether the throw succeeds, opponents encountering the thief suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls if the thief is outside their line of sight.

If the throw succeeds, the thief is also **sneaking**. If the throw fails, the thief is not sneaking. When sneaking, the thief makes no noise when he moves — none whatsoever. Even alert creatures that make a successful Listening proficiency throw will not hear a sound. When a sneaking thief engages an unengaged opponent from the rear, the opponent cannot make a free facing change.

**Streetwise:** The thief has learned the hard lessons taught by life as a criminal. He might begin play as a member of a thieves’ guild or other criminal syndicate (Judge’s discretion). He can engage in hijinks if he has the necessary proficiencies or thief skills. He can automatically identify gestures, signs, slang, and territory of criminal organizations in his home settlement. He can identify those of other urban settlements with a proficiency throw of 11+. Secret organizations or organizations in far-off cities might be harder to recognize. (This class power is equivalent to one rank of Streetwise proficiency.)

**Trapbreaking:** With the aid of thieves’ tools, a thief can attempt to disable or discharge a trap harmlessly. A thief can crack traps either hastily or methodically.

* Attempting to hastily disarm a trap requires one round and a Trapbreaking proficiency throw. If the throw succeeds, the trap is disarmed or discharged harmlessly (thief’s choice). If it fails on a natural roll of 1 – 3, the thief accidentally triggers the trap. If it fails on any other result, the thief cannot figure out how to quickly disable the trap. He can still attempt to disable it methodically, but cannot make another attempt to hastily remove the same trap again until he reaches a higher experience level.
* Attempting to methodically disarm a trap requires one turn (10 minutes) and a Trapbreaking proficiency throw with a +4 bonus. If the throw succeeds, the trap is disarmed or discharged harmlessly. If it fails on a natural roll of 1, the thief accidentally triggers the trap. If it fails on any other result, the thief is unable to disable the trap. The thief can make repeated attempts to methodically remove the same trap if desired.

Other bonuses or penalties might apply to the proficiency throw, depending on the thief’s tools, the complexity of the trap, and other factors.

###### Additional Class Powers

When they advance in level, thieves gain the following additional class powers:

**Deciphering (4th level):** The thief gains the ability to decipher text(including ciphers, treasure maps, and dead languages, but not magical writings). Deciphering a page of text requires one turn (10 minutes) and a successful proficiency throw of 4+ on 1d20. If the roll does not succeed, the thief cannot try to decipher that particular page of text until he reaches a higher level of experience.

**Hideout (9th level):** By acquiring a **hideout** worth at least 5,000gp, the thief can attract followers to his service. 2d6 1st level thieves will arrive to serve him as followers within 1d4 weeks of him acquiring the hideout. If the thief already has a hideout, the followers arrive to serve him within 1d4 weeks of him reaching 9th level. If hired, the followers must be paid standard rates for ruffians. These followers will serve the character with some loyalty, though at least one will be an infiltrator working for the thief’s local rivals, sent to keep an eye on the character. A cunning and resourceful thief can use these followers to start a criminal syndicate. Additional rules for hideouts and syndicates are detailed in the **Campaigns** chapter (p. XX).

**Scrollreading (10th):** The thief gains the ability to read and cast magic from arcane and divine scrolls. The thief does not have to be able to read the language in which the scroll is written provided he has successfully deciphered it before. Reading a magical scroll requires one round and a successful proficiency throw of 4+ on 1d20. However, a failed throw means the spell does not function as expected, and can create a horrible effect at the Judge’s discretion.

###### Class Proficiencies

**Proficiency Progression:** At 1st level, thieves select one class proficiency from their class proficiency list and one general proficiency from the general proficiency list. They select an additional class proficiency at 4th, 8th, and 12th level. They select an additional general proficiency at 5th, 9th, and 13th level.

**Thief Proficiency List:** Acrobatics, Alertness, Arcane Dabbling, Bribery, Cat Burglary, Combat Reflexes, Combat Trickery (disarm, incapacitate), Contortionism, Fighting Style Specialization, Gambling, Intimidation, Lip Reading, Lockpicking Expertise, Mapping, Poisoning, Precise Shooting, Riding, Running, Seafaring, Skirmishing, Skulking, Sniping, Swashbuckling, Trapfinding, Unarmed Fighting, Weapon Finesse, Weapon Focus

### Mage

Key Attribute: INT

Requirements: None

Hit Dice: 1d4

Maximum Level: 14

Sometimes called wizards, sorcerers, or magicians, mages study arcane secrets and cast spells. While early in their career mages have only limited power, experienced mages are able to cast a great number of powerful spells. In the Auran Empire, a mage might be a wizard steeped in the lore of the Tower of Knowledge, a sinister sorcerer of Kemesh or the Sunset Kingdoms, or a hedge wizard with strange charms and hodge-podge traditions.

###### Combat Characteristics

Because of their devotion to arcane study, mages receive limited combat training. They are quite vulnerable to physical danger, and in an adventuring group they should be protected.

**Combat Proficiencies:** Mages have weapon proficiency with clubs, daggers, darts, and staffs. They have no armor proficiency. They have fighting style proficiency with the two-handed weapon style (allowing them to use a staff with both hands), but not with the dual weapon or weaponand shield styles.

**Combat Progression:** Mages advance in attack throws and saving throws by only two points every six levels of experience (i.e., half as fast as fighters). They do not gain any bonus to damage as they advance in level. They cannot cleave, regardless of their level.

| 13 – 14 | 9+ | 9+ | 11+ | 7+ | 8+ | 6+ |

###### Starting Class Powers

At the start of play, mages have the following class powers.

**Arcane Magic:** Mages can learn and cast powerful arcane spells. The number and levels of spells the mage can cast in a single day are listed on the Mage Spell Progression table. A mage’s spell selection is limited to the spells in his **repertoire**. A mage’s repertoire can include a number of spells up to the number and level of spells listed for his level, increased by his Intellect bonus. For instance, Quintus, a 3rd level mage, is able to cast 2 1st level spells and 1 2nd level spell per day. If he has 16 INT (+2 modifier) he can have up to 4 1st level and 3 2nd level spells in his repertoire (though the number of spells he can cast each day is unaffected). More information on casting spells and individual spell descriptions can be found in the **Spells** chapter.

**Collegiate Wizardry**: The mage has received arcane instruction as an apprentice to a mage, pupil at a magical academy, or member of an arcane organization. He can begin play as a member of a wizard’s guild or similar order (Judge’s discretion). He can automatically identify arcane symbols, spell signatures, trappings, and grimoires of his own order or tradition, and can recognize those of other orders or traditions with a proficiency throw of 11+. Rare or esoteric traditions might be harder to recognize. (This class power is the equivalent of one rank of Collegiate Wizardry proficiency).

###### Additional Class Powers

When they advance in level, mages gain the following additional class powers:

**Minor Magical Research (5th level):** The mage can research spells, scribe magical scrolls, and brew potions. Rules for magic research can be found in the **Campaigns** chapter (p. XX).

**Major Magical Research (9th level):** The mage can create more powerful magic items such as weapons, rings, and staffs.

**Sanctum (9th level):** By acquiring a **sanctum** (often a great tower) worth at least 15,000gp, the mage can attract followers to his service. 1d6 apprentices of 1st – 3rd level plus 2d6 apprentices of 0th level arrive to serve him as followers within 1d3 months of him acquiring the sanctum. If the mage already has a sanctum, the followers arrive to serve him within 1d3 months of him reaching 9th level. The apprentices function as assistants in magical research (see p. XXX). If performing magic research, the apprentices must be provided food and lodging, but need not be paid wages. (If asked to accompany the mage on an adventure, the apprentices must be paid wages as henchmen.) If the mage builds a **dungeon** beneath or near his sanctum, monsters will start to arrive to dwell within, often followed by adventurers seeking to fight them. Additional rules for mages’ **sanctums** are detailed in the **Campaigns** chapter (p. XX).

**Supreme Magical Research (11th level):** The mage can learn and cast ritual arcane spells of great power (7th, 8th, and 9th level), craft magical constructs, and create magical crossbreeds. If chaotic, the mage can create necromantic servants and become undead.

###### Class Proficiencies

**Proficiency Progression:** At 1st level, mages select one class proficiency from their class proficiency list and one general proficiency from the general proficiency list. They select an additional class proficiency at 6th and 12th level. They select an additional general proficiency at 5th, 9th, and 13th level.

**Mage Proficiency List**: Alchemy, Battle Magic, Beast Friendship, Black Lore of Zahar, Bright Lore of Aura, Counterspelling, Diplomacy, Elementalism, Elven Bloodline, Engineering, Expanded Repertoire, Experimenting, Familiar, Healing, Illusion Resistance, Knowledge, Language, Loremastery, Magical Engineering, Mastery of Enchantments & Illusions, Mastery of Conjuration & Summoning, Mystic Aura, Quiet Magic, Prestidigitation, Sensing Power, Soothsaying, Transmogrification, Unflappable Casting

**Notes:** Most characters of this class have above average Intellect, and the templates above reflect that. Each template assumes that the character has an INT attribute of between 13 and 15, qualifying him for one bonus proficiency and one bonus spell. The bonus proficiency and bonus spell that each template begins with are noted last. For characters with INT of less than 13 or greater than 15, see the **Intellect Scores of Studious Spellcasters** section earlier in this Chapter.

The Elementalist can choose to replace the fire spells with one of three alternative spell selections available, one for each element:

Air: *thunderclap*,*weave**smoke*

Earth: *earth’s**excrescence*, *sling**stone*

Water: *desiccate*, *slickness*

### Crusader

Key Attribute: WIL

Requirements: None

Hit Dice: 1d6

Maximum Level: 14

Crusaders are holy warriors, trained to fight to further the ends of their faith. Humans who become crusaders have pledged their lives to serve a particular deity or religion. To this end, they conduct their lives in a way that furthers the desires and will of their gods or goddesses. In the Auran Empire, a crusader might be a priest-militant of Ammonar, bearing the light of the Winged Sun against evil, a warrior-monk sworn to the chthonic powers of the Nether Darkness, or anything in between.

###### Combat Characteristics

Crusaders are skilled combatants, albeit not as good as fighters. Though they lack the killer instincts of a trained warrior, their armored conviction can hold the line as well as any.

**Combat Proficiencies:** As they are holy warriors, the particular weapons and armor that crusaders are trained to fight with are determined by the strictures of their religious order. If your Judge has not specified particular religious orders in his campaign, the default crusader is assumed to be a worshipper of Ammonar, God of Law and Light.

The crusaders of Ammonar have weapon proficiency with bolas, cestus, clubs, flails, hammers, maces, morning stars, nets, rocks, slings, saps, staffs, staff-slings, and whips. They have armor proficiency with all armor. They have fighting style proficiency with the weaponand shield and two-handed weapon styles, but not with the dual weapon style. (See the bladedancercampaign class for an example of a crusader variant with a different feel).

**Combat Progression:** Crusaders advance in attack throws and saving throws by two points every four levels of experience (a progression mid-way between fighters and mages). They do not gain any bonus to damage as they advance in level. They can cleave after killing a foe a maximum of once per round per every two class levels (rounded down).

###### Starting Class Powers

At the start of play, crusaders have the following class powers.

**Divine Magic:** By invoking or praying to their deities, crusaders can manifest their power in the form of divine spells. The number and levels of spells the crusader can cast in a single day are listed on the Crusader Spell Progression table. The crusader’s spell selection is limited to the spells in his order’s **repertoire**. See the **Spells** chapter for a list of all available spells.

**Theology:** The crusader has received religious instruction at a seminary, monastery, or temple. He can begin play as a member of a religious hierarchy (Judge’s discretion). He can acquire congregants through proselytizing. He can automatically identify religious symbols, spell signatures, trappings, and holy days of his own faith, and can recognize those of other faiths with a proficiency throw of 11+. Rare or occult cults might be harder to recognize. (This class power is the equivalent of one rank of Theology proficiency.)

**Rebuke Undead:** Most crusaders have the ability to rebuke the undead, invoking the name and power of their deity to turn away, and even destroy, dark powers. When a crusader attempts to rebuke undead, the result is determined by consulting the Crusader Rebuking Undead table, cross-referencing the type of undead with the crusader’s level.

| \*Lawful crusaders can rebuke demons, while chaotic crusaders can control demons and rebuke angels. | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |

A dash means that the crusader does not yet have the piety and power to rebuke that type of undead. An “R” indicates that the crusader automatically rebukes that type of undead, while a “D” means that the crusader automatically destroys that type of undead. A number indicates the target value for a Rebuking proficiency throw. If this roll is successful, or there is an “R” or a “D” in the chart, the crusader immediately rolls 2d6 to see the effect. The number rolled is the number of total Hit Dice of undead monsters that are rebuked or destroyed. No matter what the dice roll result, at least one undead monster will always be rebuked or destroyed, as appropriate, on a successful rebuking. Undead with lower HD are always rebuked before undead with higher HD.

Rebuked undead flee the area for 10 rounds (1 turn) by the best and fastest means available to them. If they cannot flee, they cower in terror, taking no actions and suffering a -2 penalty to AC. If the crusader attacks rebuked undead in melee combat, the rebuking effect is broken, but he can use spells or missile weapons against them, and other characters can attack them in any fashion, without breaking the rebuking effect. Destroyed undead are immediately turned to ash.

There is no limit to how often a crusader can attempt to rebuke undead each day, but if an attempt to rebuke undead completely fails during an encounter, the crusader cannot attempt to rebuke undead again for the remainder of that encounter.

EXAMPLE: Balbus the Blessed, a 5th level crusader, has encountered three 2HD ghouls and two 4HD wights. On his initiative, he decides to rebuke them. Consulting the Rebuking Undead table, Balbus’s player sees he needs to throw 7+ to rebuke the ghouls and 10+ to rebuke the wights. He rolls a 13, meaning he might have rebuked both. Now Balbus rolls 2d6 to determine how many HD of undead he rebukes. His roll is a 6. Balbus rebukes three ghouls (2HD x 3 = 6HD) but not any wights.

Had Balbus rolled a 10 on 2d6, he’d have rebuked three ghouls and one wight. Had Balbus rolled an 8 on 1d20, he’d have only been able to rebuke the ghouls, no matter how many HD he scored.

Some chaotic sects teach their crusaders to **control undead** rather than rebuke them. The undead are controlled for 1 turn per level of the crusader. If the undead would have been destroyed, the undead are controlled for 1 day per level of the crusader instead. Controlled undead behave as if **bewitched***,* obeying the crusader as if they were friends. However, if the controlled undead are rebuked by a crusader during the duration of the control, the control is dispelled immediately. If the duration of the control ends without incident, the undead will flee as if rebuked.

###### Additional Class Powers

When they advance in level, crusaders gain the following additional class powers:

**Minor Magical Research (5th level):** The crusader can scribe scrolls and brew potions.

**Major Magical Research (9th level):** The crusader can create permanent magic items, such as weapons, rings, and staffs.

**Fortified Church (9th level):** By acquiring a **fortified church** worth at least 15,000gp, the crusader can attract followers to his service. Provided the crusader has kept to his code of behavior, he can build a fortified church at half price due to the assistance of his deity and order. 5d6 x 10 0th level troops and 1d6 crusaders of 1st level of the same religion arrive to serve him within 1d3 months of him acquiring the fortified church. If the crusader has already acquired a fortified church, the followers arrive to serve him within 1d3 months of him reaching 9th level. The followers are fanatically brave and completely loyal (loyalty +4 and morale +4). Despite their loyalty, the followers must be paid a fair wage or they might eventually leave his service. Additional rules for fortified churches are detailed in the **Campaigns** chapter (p. XX).

**Supreme Magical Research (11th level):** The crusader can learn and cast ritual divine spells of great power (7th, 8th, and 9th level), and craft magical constructs such as golems and animated statues. If chaotic, the crusader can create necromantic servants and even become undead himself. Rules for magic research can be found in the **Campaigns** chapter (p. XX).

###### Code of Behavior

In order to use spells and rebuke undead, a crusader must uphold the strictures of his faith. If the Judge has not specified particular religious orders in his campaign, the default crusader is assumed to be from the Temple of the Winged Sun, the order devoted to Ammonar, God of Light and Law. Crusaders of Ammonar must obey the following strictures.

* The crusader must always display the holy symbol of his order, the winged sun, somewhere on his person when in public.
* The crusader must offer prayers to Ammonar at dawn. Offering prayers requires one hour (6 turns).
* The crusader must not use any weapons designed to shed blood, such as swords, axes, and arrows.
* The crusader must obey the just laws of the Auran Empire and the lawful orders of its rightful authorities.
* The crusader must not use his divine magic for unlawful or chaotic purposes.

If a crusader ever violates the strictures of his faith, the god might impose penalties upon the crusader. These penalties are entirely up to the Judge. The usual penalty is **disfavor** (p. XX), but might include penalties to turning throws, a reduction in spells available, or even a loss of all crusader powers entirely. To remove the penalties, the crusader will have to atone for his violation by, e.g., sacrificing treasure, undertaking quests, or even receiving an **atonement** spell from a powerful caster of his order (Judge’s discretion).

Sometimes a crusader might grossly violate his strictures and yet seemingly suffer no punishment at all. However, in this case, what has actually occurred is that the crusader has unknowingly become aligned with a new god that is better suited to his actions. After 1d4 weeks, the crusader will learn (through dreams and omens) the identity of his new deity and their new strictures. It is up to the crusader to decide at that time whether to seek atonement with his prior god, or to accept his new faith (which might require, among other things, an alignment change). Because it is impossible to tell the source of a crusader’s divine power, a religious order must pay close attention to the actual behavior of its crusaders to be certain that they are not apostates, heretics, or false prophets. Some religious orders might have special clergy (inquisitors) to root out such characters.

###### Class Proficiencies

**Proficiency Progression:** At 1st level, crusaders select one class proficiency from their class proficiency list and one general proficiency from the general proficiency list. They select an additional class proficiency at 4th, 8th, and 12th level. They select an additional general proficiency at 5th, 9th, and 13th level.

**Crusader Proficiency List:** Battle Magic, Beast Friendship, Combat Trickery (force back, overrun, sunder), Command, Contemplation, Diplomacy, Divine Blessing, Divine Health, Fighting Style Specialization, Healing, Laying on Hands, Leadership, Loremastery, Magical Engineering, Martial Training, Mounted Combat, Prestidigitation, Prophecy, Quiet Magic, Righteous Rebuke, Sensing Evil, Sensing Power, Syncretism, Theology, Unflappable Casting, Weapon Focus

### Venturer

Key Attribute: CHA

Requirements: None

Hit Dice: 1d6

Maximum Level: 14

Commerce is the great wheel upon which the world turns. From the fleshy fingers of slave traders to jewel-clad guild masters, the coin and commodities of the empire are controlled by merchants. But if the stereotypical merchant is a pot-bellied financier profiting from the work of others, the venturer is his opposite: An adventurous world traveler, he personally leads caravans into unknown lands, seeking out exotic goods and new markets. Every venturer is, by definition, an adventurer, and interested in any expedition that promises riches and reward.

###### Combat Characteristics

Venturers are trained combatants, although not as skilled as fighters. They prefer to stay mobile and rely on ranged attacks while their comrades do the close-quarters combat.

**Combat Proficiencies:** Venturers have weapon proficiency with arbalests, composite bows, crossbows, daggers, long bows, short bows, and short swords. They have armor proficiency with medium, light, and very light armor. They have fighting style proficiency with the weapon and shield style, but not with the two-handed weapon or dual weapon styles.

**Combat Progression**: Venturers advance in attack throws and saving throws by two points every four levels of experience (i.e. the same as thieves). They do not gain any bonus to damage as they advance in level. They can cleave after killing a foe a maximum of once per round per every two class levels (rounded down).

###### Starting Class Powers

The business of venturers is business, and their devotion to trade and profit yields them many special abilities. At the start of play, venturers have the following class powers:

**Bribery:** Not every market obeys the rule of law, so a venturer also becomes exceptionally skilled at the art of bribery. He receives a +1 bonus to reaction rolls if he offers one day’s pay for the target; a +2 bonus for a week’s pay; and a +3 bonus for a month’s pay. His bribery is so subtle that the attempt is politely deniable by both parties. The character is only blatant enough to be charged with the crime of bribery if he rolls an unmodified 2 on 2d6.See Offering Bribes (p. XX).

**Diplomacy:** In order to open new markets and establish trade with unknown tribes, venturers studythe art of protocol and parley. They receive a +1 bonus on all reaction rolls when they attempt to parley with intelligent creatures. (This class power is equivalent to Diplomacy proficiency.)

**Expert Bargaining:** Venturers can get the best deals available for goods, services, and information. Any items the venturer purchases cost 10% less than the listed price and any items he sells go for 10% more than the listed price (as per the Bargaining proficiency). If trading with another venturer, or a character with the Bargaining proficiency,the opposed bargainers should make reaction rolls. Whichever character scores the higher result gets the discount. (Special rules apply when using Bargaining for mercantile ventures, see p. XX.) A venturer can select Bargaining proficiency to improve his skills. Each time the proficiency is selected, the character receives a +2 bonus on his reaction roll when negotiating with other bargainers. (This class power is equivalent to one rank of Bargaining proficiency.)

**Expert Traveling:** While most merchants consider risk a financial term, venturers lead their own caravans or fleets, and do so with considerable skill. Venturers begin play with their choice of either Driving or Seafaring proficiency.

**Mercantile Network:** As they travel, venturers build connections with buyers, fences, and peddlers in each area they visit. Whenever venturersbuy or sell equipment, hire retainers, and/or engage in mercantile ventures in a market they have previously entered, they can treat the market as if it were one market class larger than its actual size (Class I markets remain Class I markets) or they can take a +1 bonus to market impact, whichever is more useful. A venturer’s mercantile network does not change market class for purposes of passive investments (p. XX), however.

Cain, a 5th level venturer, is in Siadanos (a Class IV market). He wishes to purchase a heavy warhorse (700gp). According to the Equipment Availability by Market Class table, there is only a 25% chance for 1 heavy warhorse to be available in a Class IV market. However, Cain has visited Siadanos before, so he can treat it as a Class III market. There is a 100% chance for 1 heavy warhorse available in a Class III market, so Cain is able to purchase the heavy warhorse. His party members shake their heads in amazement that he’s found such a fine steed in an outpost town. “I know people,” he explains.

**Multilingual:** As world travelers, venturers become conversant in a wide variety of tongues of their trading partners, thereby gaining three bonus languages. The venturer can select some or all of these languages immediately from among those in common use in the campaign’s starting region or select them later from among those he encounters in play.

**Pathfinding:** When the venturer guides a party in familiar territory, the party gains a +4 bonus on proficiency throws to avoid getting lost. (At 1st level, a venturer is considered familiar with the civilized areas of his starting region as well as all territory within one 24-mile hex radius of civilized areas. With each additional level of experience, the radius increases one 24-mile hex further from civilization.) See the **Wilderness Expeditions** section of Chapter 6 (p. XX) for more details on getting lost.

**Treachery:** Despite the venturer’s agreeable disposition and generous fiscal offerings, sometimes business might get ugly. It is for this reason that every venturer learns the art of treachery. Anytime a venturer uses his Diplomacy or Bribery to gain a Friendly reaction roll, he can force every creature (allied or enemy) within 30’ to make surprise rolls at a -3 penalty by treacherously attacking. Any creature that fails the roll is **surprised** for the first round of combat. If the venturer has some way of secretly signaling to his party (such as Signaling proficiency) or has planned the treachery to occur in advance, then his party does not have to make the surprise roll. The art of treachery cannot be used if the NPC opposition also has a character with this power handling negotiation, due to professional courtesy and mutual paranoia.

Cain and his party members are parleying with representatives of the Argollëan Brotherhood in the sewers of the Undercity below Cyfaraun. Ownership of the elven artifacts found in the Nethercity is a point of contention but after a few minutes of discussion and a few bribes, Cain achieves Friendly reactions with the Brotherhood. With a deal seemingly at hand, Cain uses the art of treachery. He and his party gain a +3 bonus to surprise the Brotherhood thieves by immediately initiating combat.

However, if Liber Faunus were present, this bonus would not apply, because the leader of the Brotherhood is a venturer and hence also comprehends the art of treachery.

###### Additional Class Powers

**Steady Trade Route (2nd level):** Through long-term business dealings, the venturer establishes a steady trade route for transactions in any two types of merchandise between any two of the markets that he has visited. The trade route’s markets, and the specific type of merchandise that is bought and sold at each market, is chosen by the venturer when he establishes the trade route.

Thereafter, anytime the venturer personally enters one of the trade route’s markets, he can add one-half his class level (rounded up) to his market impact when determining the amount of merchandise of that type available for purchase or sale. If that results in his market impact exceeding the market maximum, reduce the market impact by 4 but shift to the next highest market class.

A venturer can also manage an additional passive investment per steady trade route he establishes (p. XX).

**Rumormongering (4th level):** The venturer has learned that business empires rise and fall on information. Through his rumormongering, he can automatically learn 1d4 interesting rumors from old contacts and commercial associates any time he re-visits an urban settlement he has previously done business in. Rumormongering requires one day of dedicated activity in an urban settlement. A venturer can rumormonger in any given urban settlement only once per month.

**Steady Trade Route (6th level):** The venturer establishes a second steady trade route for transactions in any two types of merchandise between any two of the markets that he has visited. The trade route can be for the same merchandise in a new market or markets, for different merchandise in the same market as his current route, or for different merchandise in different markets, as desired. As noted above, the venturer can also manage one additional passive investment when he establishes this trade route.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Market Class | Max Capital / Month |
| I | 100,000gp\* |
| II | 25,000gp |
| III | 10,000gp |
| IV | 5,000gp |
| V | 2,000gp |
| VI | 1,000gp |
| \*Per 20,000 families | |

**Access to Capital (8th level):** The venturer’s reputation for money-making aids him in securing financing. He can borrow money from the merchant guild at an interest rate of 3% per month without collateral or at an interest rate of 1% per month with collateral. There is no limit to how much he can borrow in total, but each market only has a limited pool of capital for use each month, shown on the adjoining table. If the venturer fails to pay interest each month, he becomes disreputable in that market. While disreputable, he cannot use his mercantile network or friendly merchant connections. If the venturer allows interest payments to build up such that he owes more in gp than his total XP, then his former business partners will begin to send rival adventurers after him, with wages by level that total the monthly interest payment. A henchman will notuse this ability on behalf of his employer, but a player character can do so on behalf of his fellow party members.

Cain has advanced to 8th level, and gains access to capital. While visiting Aura (a huge Class I market with 100,000 families), he borrows 500,000gp without collateral, which he uses to help his fellow adventurers begin building strongholds. However, each month he owes 3% on the outstanding balance in interest, i.e. 15,000gp. If he fails to meet his interest payments, he will become disreputable in Aura, losing use of many of his class powers. In addition, because he owes more than his XP total, if he fails to pay then the merchant guild will send bounty hunters after him. With a debt payment of 15,000gp, he might face a 12th and 8th level bounty hunter team (12,000gp and 3,000gp wage respectively), a party of 5 8th-level bounty hunters (3,000gp wage each), etc.

**Guildhouse (9th level):** By acquiring a **guildhouse** worth at least 5,000gp, the venturer can attract followers to his service. 2d6 1st level venturers will arrive to serve him as followers within 1d4 weeks of him acquiring the guildhouse. If the venturer already has a guildhouse, the followers arrive to serve him within 1d4 weeks of him reaching 9th level. If hired, the followers must be paid standard rates for henchmen. These followers will serve the character with some loyalty, though at least one will be an infiltrator working for the venturer’s local rivals, sent to keep an eye on the character.

Some venturers use their guildhouse to start a criminal syndicate, expanding their wealth through illegitimate channels. When a venturer operates a criminal syndicate, his guildhouse counts as a hideout of one-half its value. The venturer otherwise follows all of the rules for hideouts and hijinks detailed in the **Campaigns** chapter (p. XX).

All venturers, of course, use their guildhouse to coordinate their legitimate investments. The venturer can make a number of additional passive investment of any type equal to the value of his guildhouse divided by the maximum investment in the market class where his guildhouse is located. Rules for passive investments can be found in the **Campaigns** chapter (p. XX).

**Steady Trade Route (10th level):** The venturer establishes a third steady trade route for transactions in any two types of merchandise between any two of the markets that he has visited. The trade route can be for the same merchandise in a new market or markets, for different merchandise in the same market as his current route, or for different merchandise in different markets, as desired. As noted above, the venturer can also manage one additional passive investment when he establishes this trade route.

**Monopoly Power (12th level):** If the venturer has established a guildhouse in a settlement, he canuse it to seize **monopoly power** in that settlement. Thereafter, he earns 1gp per month in monopoly revenue per urban family in the urban settlement. He does not need to be the domain’s ruler to earn this revenue; if he is the domain’s ruler, the monopoly revenue is in addition to his domain revenue. Only one venturer in each urban settlement can earn monopoly revenue from each urban family. If there is more than one venturer with this class power operating in the settlement, then either the character must eliminate his rival(s) or he must come to a deal to distribute the monopoly revenue between the various venturers.

Cain has now become a 12th level merchant prince with a merchant guildhouse in Aura. Aura has 100,000 families, so Cain could earn as much as 100,000gp per month in monopoly revenue if he were the sole venturer in the city. However, the ancient and opulent capital has three other high-level venturers living there, including Armento Drakomir, Tullius Valens, and Varian Lazar. Cain partners with Armento Drakomir to eliminate Tullius Valens and Varian Lazar and the two then split the families between them, each earning 50,000gp in monopoly revenue per month.
