## Spell Lists by Magic Type

Each type of magic has its own **spell list** which includes every spell its practitioners could theoretically cast.The length of a magic type’s spell list is theoretically infinite so for practical purposes this book presents only the most common spells for each type.

The Arcane Spell List presented in this book consists of just the arcane spells which the Tower of Knowledge in Aura has canonical knowledge, either because it teaches them or has banned them. Many spells that were once known have been forgotten, existing only in dusty tomes and rare grimoires, or in the minds of slumbering undead lords. Studious casters can, when they reach 5th level, begin to research their own additions to their magic’s spell list.

The Divine Spell List presented in this book consists of all of the divine spells which are known to the theologians of Aura. The list includes those granted by the Empyrean gods of Law, the Chthonic gods of Chaos, and the numerous elemental powers, petty gods, and lesser spirits of the world. There are other divine spells in the game world, made available by old powers long forgotten or bizarre cults with strange practices.
