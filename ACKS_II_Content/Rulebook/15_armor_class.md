## Armor Class

Armor class (AC) is a measure of how challenging it is to damage your character. An unarmored character of average attributes has an AC of 0. AC is determined by what kind of armor the character is wearing and whether he has a shield equipped. AC can be modified by the character’s DEX modifier and certain class powers, proficiencies, conditions, magic items, and spells. After you buy your equipment, calculate your character’s AC and record it on your character sheet.
