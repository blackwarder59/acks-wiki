## Organization and Command in Very Small or Very Large Armies

A typical army built using the rules above will have 10 to 25 units, representing a force of around 600 to 3,000 combatants. This is a perfectly sized army for war-mongering barons, earls, counts, and dukes, such as most adventuring player characters. However, high-level ***ACKS***campaigns can feature far larger armies, with battles between empires fielding tens of thousands of troops on each side. Other campaigns might feature clashes between war bands of a few hundred troops.

When armies are very small or very large, the company-scale unit and division structure outlined above will not suffice. If the army has 600 or fewer troops, organize its troops into **platoon-scale** units. If the army has 3,001 to 12,000 troops, organize its troops into **battalion-scale** units. If the army has 12,001 or more troops, organize its troops into **brigade-scale** units.

Larger-sized units require more experienced officers. The stricter qualification requirements serve to keep the number of officers to a manageable level. While there are obviously still low- and mid-level characters leading smaller sub-formations in the army, they don’t need to be tracked. Just as company-sized units are subsumed into battalions and brigades, the company-scale officers are subsumed into the units they are part of.

Conversely, smaller-sized units require less experienced offers. Low- and mid-level characters can serve as important commanders and lieutenants in battles of this scale. The Army Size and Unit Scale table shows the unit scale, troops per unit, commander qualifications, and lieutenant qualifications recommended for each army size.

A typical realm will simply not have a lieutenant available for every unit of each size. Lieutenants become progressively scarcer for larger units, reflecting the difficulty of finding competent people capable of managing large bodies of troops. About two-thirds of platoons will have a lieutenant and about one-half of companies, but only one-fourth of battalions and brigades.

| **Army Size** | **Unit Scale** | **Troops/Unit** | **Commander Qualification** | **Lieutenant Qualification** |
| 120 – 600 | Platoon | x¼: 30 infantry, 15 cavalry | NPC: 4th level; Monster: HD + 2 | NPC: 3rd level: Monster: HD + 1 |
| 601 – 3,000 | Company | x1: 120 infantry, 60 cavalry | NPC: 6th level; Monster: HD + 4 | NPC: 5th level; Monster: HD + 2 |
| 3,001 – 12,000 | Battalion | x4: 480 infantry, 240 cavalry | NPC: 8th level; Monster: HD + 6 | NPC: 7th level; Monster: HD + 4 |
| 12,001 or more | Brigade | x16: 1,920 infantry, 960 cavalry | NPC: 10th level; Monster: HD +8 | NPC: 9th level; Monster: HD + 6 |

### Beastmen Officers

As noted under **Qualifying as an Officer** (p. XX), a beastman chieftain can always serve as a commander for company-sized units of its own race, regardless of its HD; and a beastman sub-chieftain can always serve as a lieutenant for a company-sized unit of its race.

At platoon scale, a beastman sub-chieftain can always serve as a commander or lieutenant for units of its race, regardless of its HD. At battalion and brigade scale, beastman leaders do not receive any particular edge — beastmen tend to fare poorly in large-scale warfare.

### Rump Troops

When organizing small- and large-scale armies, there will often be a “rump” of excess troops left over. If the rump is less than half a unit, ignore the rump (assume it represents reserves, trainees, or sick troops). If the rump is at least half a unit, organize it as one or more understrength units. With large-scale units, you can sometimes reduce the “rump” by rounding the sizes to the nearest interval of 500, e.g. 500 infantry per battalion or 2,000 infantry per brigade, again assuming any excess is reserves, sick troops, and so on.

EXAMPLE #1: Balbus, a 14th level cleric, has become Theocrat of Aura. He raises a vast army for a crusade against Kemesh. His army consists of 6,000 heavy cavalry; 18,000 heavy infantry; 18,000 light infantry, and 18,000 bowmen, for a total of 60,000 troops. Since the army is greater than 12,000 troops, he organizes it into brigade-sized units. He divides the troops into 6 brigades of 960 heavy cavalry each; 9 brigades of 1,920 heavy infantry each; 9 brigades of 1,920 light infantry each; and 9 brigades of 1,920 bowmen each. The “rump” of excess troops is ignored. He has a total of 33 brigade-sized units in his army. Balbus has CHA 14 (+1) and Leadership proficiency. His army may have up to (4+1+1) 6 divisions. He decides to organize his army as follows:

* 1st division with six brigades of heavy cavalry
* 2nd division with four brigades of heavy infantry and two brigades of bowmen
* 3rd division with four brigades of heavy infantry and two brigades of bowmen
* 4th division with four brigades of light infantry and two brigades of bowmen
* 5th division with four brigades of light infantry and two brigades of bowmen
* 6th division with one brigade of heavy infantry, one brigade of light infantry, and one brigade of bowmen

Because the army is organized into brigade-sized units, any unit lieutenants will need to be at least 9th level, and each division commander will need to be at least 10th level.

EXAMPLE #2: An orc village is going to war. The village consists of 1 orc chief, 6 sub-chieftains, 30 champions (1+1 Hit Dice each), and 180 orcs. The orc chief organizes his army into seven platoons. Six platoons consist of 30 orcs each. The seventh platoon consists of 30 champions. The orc chief has a leadership ability of 4, so he may have up to four divisions in his army. He organizes his divisions as follows:

* 1st division with one platoon of orc champions, commanded by the orc chief
* 2nd division with two platoons of orcs, commanded by an orc sub-chief
* 3rd division with two platoons of orcs, commanded by an orc sub-chief
* 4th division with two platoons of orcs, commanded by an orc sub-chief

The remaining three orc sub-chiefs are distributed as lieutenants.
