## Spell Descriptions

### Spell Format

All spells are presented in this format:

Spell Name

[Magic Type] [Level] Type: [Spell Type]

Range: [Spell Range] Duration: [Spell Duration]

[Spell Description]

A spell’s **magic type** is either Arcane or Divine. A spell’s **level** ranges from 1 to 6. A spell’s **duration** is the length of time the effects of the spell last. A spell’s **range** is an indication of how far from the caster the spell can reach.

### Defined Terms

###### Affected Creature

An affected creature is either a recipient or target of a spell, or a creature inside the area of effect of a spell. The caster himself can be an affected creature for many spells.

###### Ally

An ally is a creature friendly to the spell’s caster, recipient, or target. The Judge makes the final determination as to which creatures, if any, count as allies. A caster is generally his own ally.

###### Animal

An animal is any animal, giant animal, or prehistorical animal that is not a giant, humanoid, monstrosity, or undead.

###### Baseline Hit Dice

A creature’s Baseline Hit Dice are the number of HD listed for a creature of its kind in the ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual****.* A creature can have more than its Baseline Hit Diceif it is a leveled adventurer, chief, champion, or other character with more HD than the baseline, but those HD are not considered Baseline HD. For instance, an ogre has 4+1 Baseline HD, while a 14th level fighter has only 1 Baseline HD. Baseline HD are only used for a small number of purposes, including determining whether a creature is considered a humanoid as well as the number of HD the creature has if animated as a skeleton or zombie.

###### Beholding

Some spells require that the caster is beholdingthe target or (more commonly) that the target is beholdingthe caster or the effect. Beholding simulates eye contact, “seeing the white of their eyes,” and so on. A creature beholds another creature or effect when that creature or effect is in its line of sight and within 10% of maximum visibility distance. (In normal conditions, the maximum visibility distance to a man-sized creature is 600’, so it can be beheld at 60’.) Magic effects count as man-sized creatures for purposes of being beheld. A creature can behold creatures or effects using lightless vision, but not using echolocation, mechanoreception, or shadowy senses. At the start of its initiative, a creature can close its eyes to avoid beholding a creature or effect or open its eyes if currently doing so. A creature that is closing its eyes is considered **blinded** until it stops closing its eyes.

###### Caster

The caster is the creature that cast the spell being described.

###### Caster level

Caster level is the effective level of the caster for purposes of spellcasting. Caster level is usually, but not always, the same as class level. However, some classes have a caster level that is lower than their class level, and some proficiencies can increase caster level for purposes of particular types of spells.

###### Concentration

Concentration is a condition required by some spells. Concentration can be sustained for up to 8 hours per day without penalty; concentrating for up to 12 hours counts as force marching. The condition is ended immediately if the creature takes damage or fails a saving throw (except a secret saving throw it isn’t aware of). The condition is also ended immediately if the creature attacks, casts a spell, moves more than one-half its combat movement distance during a round, or moves more than one-half its expedition speed during a day. Taking an action in lieu of moving, however, does not end the condition, nor does moving at exploration speed.

###### Dead

A recipient or target of a spell is considered dead if it was a living creature and has been slain. Conjured or summoned creatures are dispelled or destroyed rather than slain, and do not ever count as dead, but called creatures can be slain.

A living creature that is unconscious and possibly dead can be targeted with a spell as if it were dead. The spell triggers an immediate roll on the Mortal Wounds table with a penalty equal to one-half the spell level. If the creature is slain, the spell takes effect normally. If the creature is still alive, the spell fails. The effects of the roll are applied to the creature in either case.

###### Dispelled

A spell is dispelled if it is successfully extinguished by a *counterspell* or *dispel magic* spell. A curse is dispelled if it is successfully extinguished by a *remove curse*spell. A conjured or summoned creature is dispelled if it is returned to its plane of existence by a *dispel evil* or *dispel magic* spell or by the caster. Some spells cannot be dispelled, or have more stringent requirements to dispel.

###### Enchanted Creature

An enchanted creature is any construct, incarnation, or undead, or any conjured or summoned creature regardless of type, or any other type of creature designated in the ***Monstrous Manual***as enchanted. Called creatures are not enchanted creatures, however.

###### Enemy

An enemy is a creature hostile to the spell’s caster, recipient, or target. Enemy is synonymous with opponent and hostile creature. The Judge makes the final determination as to which creatures, if any, count as enemies.

###### Humanoid

A humanoid is any bugbear, dryad, dwarf, elf, gnoll, gnome, goblin, hobgoblin, human, kobold, lizardman, merman, morlock, neanderthal, naiad, ogre, pixie, sprite, troglodytes, or other man-like creatures no larger than an ogre and possessing fewer than 5 Baseline Hit Dice.

###### Living

A recipient or target of a spell is considered living if it is an animal, giant, humanoid, monstrosity, ooze, plant, or vermin that is not dead or undead.

###### Indefinite

Indefinite is a spell duration. An indefinite spell lasts until a particular circumstance causes it to end. The circumstances that end the spell will be described in the spell description; they might be a saving throw by the target creature, a loss of concentration by the caster, or other factors. An indefinite spell is not perpetual, and a caster’s death does not cause an indefinite spell to end.

###### Object

An object is any piece of armor, equipment, mindless plant (such as a tree), structure, vehicle, or vessel, or anything with structural hit points. The Judge makes the final determination whether a particular thing is worth treating as an object.

###### Perpetual

Perpetual is a spell duration. A perpetual spell lasts until either the caster decides to stop sustaining the spell at the start of his initiative, the caster or the target or recipient creature or creatures die, or the spell is dispelled. (A perpetual spell cast by an object on a creature ends when the creature dies, without regard for the creator’s life or death.) A caster can sustain a maximum of one perpetualspell per caster level for each spell level he can cast. For instance, a 5th level caster could sustain 5 1st, 5 2nd, and 5 3rd perpetual spells. A truly permanent effect requires a **permanency** ritual or magic item.

###### Plant

Plant is a category of creature that includes both ordinary plants such as trees and grass as well as plant-like monsters. It does not include oozes.

###### Recipient

A recipient is a target which willingly subjects itself to the spell targeting it. When a spell can affect both willing recipients and unwilling targets, a recipient is sometimes called a **willing target**.

###### Sapiency

Creatures can be mindless, bestial, semi-sapient, or sapient. Mindless creatures function purely on instinct. Bestial creatures are aware of their environment, can remember past events, and can engage in limited problem-solving, but are not self-aware. Semi-sapient creatures are self-aware but lack one or more of the capabilities of sapient creatures, such as abstract reasoning, grammatical language, or tool use. Sapient creatures are self-aware and capable of abstract reasoning, grammatical language, and tool use. Most constructs, oozes, and vermin are mindless, while most animals are bestial. Some animals, such as apes, elephants, parrots, and ravens, are semi-sapient. Monstrosities can be bestial, semi-sapient, or sapient. Giants and humanoids are always sapient. A creature’s sapiency determines the opportunity and frequency for it to make saving throws against certain spells.

###### Special

Special is a spell duration. A special spell’s duration is described in the spell’s description. Most spells with a special duration are perpetual except insofar as a particular trigger might end them. In other words, they are indefinite perpetual spells. Other special durations occur for spells with variable effects or multiple steps. The exact details will be as noted by the spell.

###### Stationary Concentration

Stationary concentration is a condition required of the caster by some spells. Concentration can be sustained for up to 8 hours per day without penalty; concentrating for up to 12 hours counts as force marching. Stationary concentration ends if a creature takes damage or fails a saving throw (except a secret saving throw it isn’t aware of). The condition also ends if the creature takes any action other than remaining stationary and sustaining the spell.

###### Structure

Some spells can damage structures. For purposes of spells, structures include anything with structural hit points. They exclude objects that do not have structural hit points, such as armor, equipment, or weapons. If a structure is destroyed by a spell with an area of effect, creatures that would have been in the area of effect were they not protected by the structure will take damage. However, the damage is reduced by the amount of shp required to destroy the structure and the creatures save as if they were behind an arrow loop (+4 to save vs. Blast and taking no damage on success).

###### Target

A target is a creature, object, or area of space at which a spell is aimed or directed. The creature, object, or center point of the area must be in spell range and line of sight of the caster in order to be an eligible target of a spell. If the range of the spell is touch, an attack throw might be required to affect the target. Some spells further limit eligible targets to only objects, only creatures, or only creatures of particular sorts. Some spells permit saving throws only for target creatures and not for target objects, or only for target objects carried or worn by a creature.

###### Touch

Touch is a range. When a spell has a touch range, the caster must succeed on an unarmed melee attack throw against the spell’s target when the spell is cast. Unless otherwise noted, the creature’s full AC applies. Touching a recipient creature does not require an attack throw. Self-touching does not require an attack throw but sure could use a better term. The caster can always claim line of sight on a touched creature even if blinded, in darkness, etc.

### Spell Index

###### Adjust Self

Arcane 2 Type: transmogrification

Range: selfDuration: 6 turns + 1 turn/caster level

This spell grants the caster the ability to alter his shape into that of any other humanoid creature. The caster can control his new shape’s physical qualities (such as height, weight, gender, hair color, hair texture, and skin color) within the normal ranges for a creature of its kind. His equipment, if any, remains worn or held where possible, and otherwise melds into the new form. If used in conjunction with a successful Disguise proficiency throw, *adjust self* can allow the caster to appear as a specific individual. The caster must be man-sized or smaller when he casts this spell or it fails to work.

###### Animate Undead

Arcane 4, Divine 4 Type: necromancy

Range: touch Duration: 1 day or permanent

This spell animates the bones or bodies of one or more dead targets, transforming them into undead skeletons or zombies under the caster’s command. The caster can animate a number of Hit Dice of undead equal to twice his caster level each time he casts this spell. Animated skeletons have Hit Dice equal to the Baseline Hit Dice such creatures have in life; for skeletons of humans or demi-humans, this means one Hit Die, regardless of the character level of the deceased. Zombies have one more Hit Die than the creatures’ Baseline HD. An animated skeleton can be created only from a mostly intact skeleton; a zombie can be created only from a mostly intact corpse.

The caster can give verbal orders to the animated undead when they rise and thereafter anytime they are in line of sight on his initiative. Complex or extensive orders require the caster to expend action in lieu of moving, but simple orders (“protect me!”) do not require an action. Orders can be given in any language the caster speaks. The animated undead will mindlessly obey whatever orders they are given to the best of their (limited) ability. They cannot accomplish tasks that require abstract thought or higher reasoning. If they complete all of their orders, or for whatever reason are physically unable to obey their orders, the undead will simply remain stationary until they receive new orders. The undead act on their own initiative each round.

*Animate undead*normally lasts for just one day, after which the creatures’ remains crumble to dust. However, the spellcaster can make the spell permanent by anointing each zombie or skeleton with 1 vial of unholy water per Hit Die. If this is done, the undead are permanently animated until they are destroyed. *Animate undead* is the reverse of *smite undead*.

###### Allure

Divine 1 Type: enchantment

Range: selfDuration: 6 turns

This spell imbues the caster with an enchanting allure of beauty and power. The exact effect can vary depending on the caster’s spell signature. For the duration of the spell, the caster gains the benefits of the Mystic Aura proficiency. If the caster already has the Mystic Aura proficiency, he gains a further +1 bonus to reaction rolls.

###### Angelic Aura

Divine 4 Type: death

Range: selfDuration: 1 round/level

This spell creates a glowing aura of empyrean power around the caster in a 15’ radius. When the spell is cast, and on the caster’s initiative each round thereafter for the duration of the spell, the *angelic aura* can damage undead creatures within its area of effect. Up to one undead creature can be targeted per caster level. Undead creatures with the fewest HD must be targeted first. Any excess HD of effectiveness are lost. When one or more creatures with the same number of HD are eligible to be targets, the caster can choose which are affected. Each targeted undead creature must make a Death saving throw. If the save succeeds, the undead creature avoids the effect that round. If the save fails, the undead creature suffers 5d8 extraordinary luminous damage. The effects of an *angelic aura*continue until dispelledor the duration elapses. The caster does not need to concentrate to maintain the effects.

###### Angelic Choir

Divine 1 Type: illusion

Range: 45’ Duration: 6 turns

This spell creates an auditory illusion of choir music. The **angelic choir** can produce a volume of sound ranging from a soloist to an entire chorus of 64 singers of a variety of vocal types. The music can originate from any place within range of the caster. The melody, harmony, and volume of the **angelic choir** are controlled by the caster. Any lyrics will be impossible to precisely decipher, regardless of what language they are sung in. The **angelic choir** can continue for up to 1 hour (6 turns), but ceases immediately if the caster attacks or is attacked.

**Angelic choir** is primarily used by priestesses to impress their congregants during benedictions and holy rites, but some adventurers hire priestesses to cast it from the rear ranks to ensure their epic adventures are accompanied by appropriately epic music.

###### Anti-Magic Sphere

Arcane 6 , Divine 6 Type: protection

Range: selfDuration: 12 turns

This spell creates a personal barrier about the caster that stops any spell or spell-like effects (including the caster’s) from coming in or going out. Spell-like effects include all effects that duplicate a spell, or magical effects that are resisted with a Spells or Implements saving throw, but excludes effects that do not duplicate a spell and are resisted with Death, Blast, or Paralysis saves. Spells with a range of “self,” or “touch” spells used on the caster himself, are not blocked by his *anti-magic sphere*. If a creature or item with an ongoing spell or spell-like effect enters an *anti-magic sphere*, the spell or effect can be dispelled as if by a *dispel magic*from the caster. However, permanent effects or effects which cannot be dispelled are not affected. An *anti-magic sphere* lasts until **dispelled** or 12 turns lapse. However, the caster can decide to extinguish the sphere at any time during his initiative each round.

###### Arcane Armor

Arcane 1 Type: protection

Range: selfDuration: 3 turns

This spell creates a weightless and invisible suit of armor that protects the caster. The *arcane armor* negates *mage missile* attacks directed at the caster, and guarantees the caster AC 7 against missile attacks and AC 5 against melee attacks. The *arcane armor* stacks with modifiers to AC from DEX but not with modifiers to AC from armor, class powers, conditions, magic, or proficiencies. Conditions which improve an opponent’s attack throw against the creatures they affect (e.g., **flanked** or **vulnerable**) are not affected by *arcane armor*.

###### Arcane Shift

Arcane 4 Type: movement

Range: 15’Duration: instantaneous

This spell instantly teleports the caster, or a single target creature within range, to a destination within 360’ of the caster’s or target’s present location. The caster can designate the destination by accurately visualizing it, by stating direction and distance, or (if it is within line of sight) by looking at the spot. If the destination is within a creature or solid object, the spell automatically fails. Otherwise, the caster or target creature arrives at exactly the spot desired. Anything worn or carried by the caster or target will be teleported as well, including one or more other creatures carried by or mounted on the teleported creature.

A target that wishes to avoid being teleported can make a Spells saving throw. If the save succeeds, the target resists being teleported. If the save fails, the target is teleported.

EXAMPLE: Elaria is charged by a war elephant carrying a rider and a howdah with four archers. When the war elephant gets to within 10’, Elaria casts **arcane shift** on it in an attempt to send it 360’ up in the air. The war elephant doesn’t want to beteleported, so it makes a Spells saving throw. Unfortunately, the save fails. Therefore the war elephant, its rider, and all the archers are all instantly teleported upward 360’.

###### Arrows of the Sun

Divine 6 Type: blast, elemental (fire)

Range: 180’ Duration: 1 round

This spellsets aflame the nocked arrows of friendly archers within range. Up to 20 arrows can be set aflame per caster level. A flaming arrowdeals an extra 1d6 points of fire damage on a successful attack. If a flaming arrow is not immediately shot, its flame harmlessly goes out at the end of the round, returning the arrow to an ordinary weapon.

This spell was created for battlefield use. In ***Domains at War: Battles****,* it can affect a friendly bow-equipped unit within six hexes of the caster’s hex. That unit deals an extra point of damage on each successful bow attack throw during its next attack sequence.

###### Atonement

Divine 5 Type: esoteric, healing

Range: touchDuration: instantaneous

This spell removes the spiritual burden of unwilling evil acts or misdeeds from the recipient. The recipient must be truly repentant and desirous of setting right its misdeeds or the spell fails. *Atonement* can reverse magical alignment changes or restore the class powers of divine casters who have strayed from their code of behavior. Because of the complexity of the prayers involved in *atonement*, the spell takes 1 turn to cast.

###### Auditory Illusion

Arcane 1 Type: illusion

Range: 30’Duration: 1 round per level

This spell creates a false sound. The sound can be centered anywhere within range, and within that range the sound can fluctuate and move, imitating approaching or receding footsteps, laughter, voices, and other possibilities. The caster can dynamically control the sound if he is within range of it. The sound produced can be as loud as the noise produced by thirty man-sized creatures. The *auditory illusion* does not have to be human-like; it can replicate animal cries, monstrous roars, trickling water, and other sounds. The Judge should determine how much sound and how many individuals it might represent. For instance, the sounds of thirty humans might be approximately that of sixty children, or eight ogres.

A creature who has reason to be suspicious about the reality of the sound can make a Spells saving throw to disbelieve it at the start of its initiative. If the save succeeds, the creature learns the sound is an illusion and can hear any sound it might be concealing. If the save fails, the creature continues to believe it is real. The creature cannot attempt to disbelieve the *auditory illusion*again until it has further evidence of its illusory nature (e.g. a friend tells him “it’s an illusion,” etc.)

At the caster’s discretion, the spell can be cast so that its duration does not begin until a particular trigger is met. The trigger can be as general or as detailed as desired, although only visual and audible triggers can be used. Triggers react to what appears to be the case. Disguises and illusions can fool them. Normal darkness does not defeat a visual trigger, but magical *tenebrosity* or *invisibility* does. Silent movement or magical silence defeats audible triggers. Audible triggers can be keyed to general types of noises or to a specific noise or spoken word. Actions can serve as triggers if they are visible or audible. The trigger cannot distinguish level, Hit Dice, or class except by external garb. The illusion can respond to triggers as far as 45’ away. Regardless of range, the illusion can respond only to visible or audible triggers and actions in line of sight or within hearing distance.

When the spell is cast with a trigger, the caster must specify sound that it will make in advance, in case he is not there to dynamically control it. (If he is within range when it is triggered, he can dynamically control the sound.) The point at which the *auditory illusion* is centered will be noticeable with *discern magic* and the effect can be **dispelled** by targeting that point**.**

###### Augury

Divine 2 Type: detection, esoteric

Range: selfDuration: instantaneous

This spell can allow the caster to foresee whether a particular action is likely to bring about good or bad results. Auguries are not always accurate, however. When the spell is cast, the Judge secretly makes a magic research throw on behalf of the caster. A natural roll of at least 7 always succeeds. If the throw succeeds, the augury is true and reliable. If the throw fails, the augury is false and misleading. In addition, the *augury* can see into the future only 3 turns, so anything that might happen after that does not affect the result. Thus, the result will not take into account the long-term consequences of a contemplated action.

EXAMPLE: Zeodarë casts *augury*to assess whether opening a treasure chest she’s discovered is likely to bring about a good or bad result. The Judge secretly makes a magic research throw on her behalf and rolls an 11, so her augury is true. The Judge knows that the chest is not locked or trapped, and contains 4,000gp. Therefore, he tells her that opening the chest will bring about a good result. The fact that the gold coins belong to a murderous assassin who will come hunting for her when he discovers they have been stolen is not reflected in the *augury*, because that event won’t happen in the next half hour.

###### Avian Messenger

Arcane 3, Divine 3 Type: summoning, transmogrification

Range: specialDuration: 12 hours

This spell allows the caster to relay a message to a recipient by means of an *avian messenger***.** The *messenger* will be a small winged creature capable of long-distance flight. The spell will conscript the nearest suitable creature to serve as the *avian messenger*so it might be, e.g., a pigeon, a raven, a bat, or even a dragonfly, depending on what is nearby when the spell is cast. As soon as the spell is cast, the *avian messenger* will begin traveling to the caster, typically arriving within 2d6 rounds. If the avian messenger is somehow prevented from reaching the caster (e.g. if he is imprisoned deep underground), it will circle in the vicinity until it is able to reach him or until the spell expires.

Once the *avian messenger*reaches the caster, it will wait up to 10 minutes (one turn) for the caster to whisper his desired message into its ear. If the caster fails to whisper a message into the *messenger*’s ear within 10 minutes, the spell ends and the creature flies off. The *avian messenger*can understand any language(s) the caster speaks, and remember a message up to 1 minute (one round) long per level of the caster.

Once the caster has finished whispering his message, he must designate a recipient for the message. The caster must know the proper name or identifying title of the recipient and the location of his residence (either firsthand, from scrying, or from a map). Once the recipient has been designated, the *avian messenger*will begin traveling to the recipient’s residence. The *avian messenger* will travel for up to 12 hours at a rate of 48 miles per hour in order to reach the recipient’s residence. If the recipient is present when the *messenger*arrives, it will whisper the message into his ear in whatever language the caster spoke. If the recipient is absent, or somehow inaccessible (e.g. in a windowless room), the *avian messenger* will circle in the vicinity until it is able to reach him or until the spell expires.

###### Bane-Rune

Divine 1 Type: transmogrification

Range: touchDuration: 1 turn

This spell inscribes a baleful glyph on to the target weapon or weapons touched. A maximum of 20 arrows, 2 tiny melee weapons, or 1 small, medium, or large melee weapon can be affected with each casting. The affected weapon or weapons are temporarily enhanced to the equivalent of a **magic weapon +2** against a particular type of creature. The type of creature is chosen by the caster when the spell is cast: animals, beastmen, constructs, dragons, giants, humanoids (excluding beastmen), incarnations, monstrosities (excluding dragons), oozes, plants, undead, or vermin. Weapons that are already magic gain an additional +1 against the type of creature while the spell is in effect.

###### Banner of Invincibility

Arcane 6, Divine 6 Type: protection

Range: touchDuration: 1 turn

This spell imbues a target banner, pennant, standard, or other flag touched by the caster with powerful protective magic. While the spell is in effect, any missile or melee attacks dealing mundane damage targeted at the bearer of the target flag or any of the bearer’s allies within 10’ of the flag are deflected and automatically miss. If the deflected attack has an area of effect, roll for scatter to determine the direction and distance deflected; however, the center point of the area of effect must be at least 10’ from the flag bearer. The protected creatures can still be harmed if the area of effect is so large that it can affect them despite being at least 10’ from the flag. Attacks made with silver weapons are considered to deal extraordinary damage for purposes of this spell.

Bearing the *banner of invincibility* counts as wielding a weapon or shield (i.e. the flag bearer can bear the flag in one hand and either wield a one-handed weapon or a shield in his other hand). The spell ends if the bearer drops the flag (voluntarily or involuntarily), if the flag is destroyed, if the spell is **dispelled**, or otherwise when the duration expires.

If used during a battle, the *banner of invincibility* can protect all man-sized creatures in a platoon-sized unit of formed foot. The unit cannot be hit by missile or melee attacks from units of less than 5 Baseline HD without appropriate weapons, and is never considered threatened by enemy units that are unable to damage it. The effect ends if the unit ever recoils, flees, or routs.

###### Barrier of Blades

Divine 6 Type: wall

Range: 120’Duration: concentration

This spell conjures a *barrier of blades*made of thousands of flying swords for the duration of the spell. The barrier of blades can be as large as 500 square feet and can be almost any shape the caster desires, provided the entire barrier is within the spell’s range and the caster does not evoke the wall such that it appears on or on top of creatures or objects.

The barrier is only as thick as the blades that constitute it, but since the blades slash and whirl continuously, anyone who approaches is at grave risk of harm. Any creatures that start their initiative or move within 5’ of the *barrier of blades* are subject to attack as if from a readied 4 HD monster with one attack dealing 2d6 extraordinary slashing damage. Any creature passing through the wall automatically suffers 2d6 extraordinary slashing damage. The barrier does not block light, movement, or vision. It cannot be affected by physical or magical attacks and is invulnerable to mundane and extraordinary damage.

If not **dispelled**, **disintegrated**, or otherwise destroyed, the barrier remains so long as the caster maintain concentration on it. The concentrating caster can move the barrier up to 20’ in any desired direction in range on her initiative each round. If this movement causes the barrier to pass over any creatures, those creatures suffer 2d6 extraordinary slashing damage, as above. Note that it is possible for a creature to be attacked at the start of its initiative by the barrier from his front side; automatically damaged by the barrier as it passes over him on the caster’s initiative; and then attacked again by the barrier on the creature’s initiative.

This spell is designed for use on battlefields. An 8.25’ tall, 60’ wide barrier of blades can destroy an entire company by moving through the troops.

###### Bath of the Goddess

Divine 6 Type: transmogrification

Range: touchDuration: perpetual

This spellinstantly transforms a living recipient of man-size or smaller into the opposite sex. The recipient gains all of the primary and secondary characteristics of its new sex (external and internal, including reproductive capacity if of breeding age), resembling an opposite-gender twin of its old self.

If the recipient has been sexually altered (e.g. a eunuch), it will suffer an equivalent alteration to its new form. If the recipient belongs to a species that has only one sex, the spell has no effect. If the recipient belongs to a species that has multiple sexes, or is an intersexed creature of a predominantly sex-binary species, the caster chooses the sex that results. (A male or female creature could be transformed into an intersexed creature by this spell if desired. It is rumored that some mystery cults require this of their high-level religious figures.)

The spell is perpetual until **dispelled** by *counterspell*or *dispel magic*, or by a second casting of this spell, at which time the subject reverts to its original sex. The spell becomes permanent if the creature births or sires children in the manner of its new sex.

No actual bathing is required to cast this spell; it just takes its name from a classical myth about a handsome priest who was transformed into a bladedancer after unintentionally bathing in a moon-lit pond in which Ianna herself had recently bathed.

###### Battering Ram

Arcane 2 Type: blast, elemental (earth)

Range: 120’Duration: instantaneous

This spell smashes a target with an invisible battering ram. The target must be made of wood or stone, be larger than man-sized, and have at least 1 structural hit point. Common targets are battlements, doors, walls, war machines, and vessels. It cannot target areas of open ground. It can only target an interior floor of wood or stone if the caster is at least one story above the floor.

The *battering ram* deals extraordinary seismic structural damage, 1d4 to a stone target or 1d4x5 to a wooden one — sufficient to knock down an oak door, break off a parapet, etc. The impact of the *battering ram* blasts shards of stone or splinters of wood from the target in a 5’ radius. Each creature in the area of effect must make a Blast saving throw. If the save fails, the creature suffers 1d6 piercing damage per caster level (maximum 5d6). If the save succeeds, the creature suffers half that damage.

###### Beguile Humanoid

Arcane 1 , Divine 2 Type: enchantment

Range: 90’Duration: 1 day

This spell can bewitch a living humanoid target with fewer than 5 HD. The target creature must make a Spells saving throw. If it or its allies are being threatened or attacked by the caster or his allies when the spell is cast, it receives a +5 bonus on its saving throw. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect. If the save fails, the target is **bewitched**.

Once bewitched, the creature feels that the caster is a beloved friend and trusted comrade. It will interpret anything the caster says or does in the most favorable manner, confabulating plausible justifications for the actions taken. If a fight breaks out between the caster and its allies, the creature will spend one round attempting to verbally defuse the fight, then thereafter fight against whichever side initiated the violence, making nonlethal attacks if possible. In more peaceful circumstances, the bewitchedcreature might agree to cover up the caster’s activities, allow him access to restricted areas, risk its own life to save his, or do any of the other foolish things that people sometimes do for their friends despite their better judgment. The Judge can use the Loyalty rules for henchmen (p. XX) to assess the bewitched creature’s response to dangerous or unusual requests.

However, the caster can neither control the bewitched creature like an automaton nor give it orders like a hireling, and attempting to do so can give the creature an additional saving throw to resist the spell (Judge’s discretion). Moreover, the spell does not provide any special means for the caster to communicate with the bewitched creature. If the caster does not speak any languages known to the creature, he can crudely communicate with grunts, gestures, and pantomime.

Once in effect, the spell lasts until **dispelled** or until 1 day elapses. It can be dispelled normally, and can be detected with *discern bewitchment*,but cannot be detected with *discern magic*.

Once the spell ends, the affected humanoid will be hostile to the caster if it was forced to risk its life without fair reward or otherwise harmed or maltreated. A bewitched humanoid that was treated kindly and respectfully might remain neutral or friendly (Judge’s discretion).

###### Bewitch Beast

Divine 2 Type: enchantment

Range: 90’Duration: indefinite

This spell can bewitch a living animal target. The target must make a Spells saving throw. If the target or its allies are being threatened or attacked by the caster or his allies when the spell is cast, it receives a +5 bonus on its saving throw. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect. If the save fails, the target is **bewitched**. The effect is identical to that of *beguile humanoid*, above.

Once in effect, the bewitchment lasts until **dispelled** or until the animal makes a successful Spells saving throw. The bewitched animal receives a saving throw to break the spell each day if it has 9 HD or more, every week if it has 5 – 8 HD, and every month if it has fewer than 5 HD. This spell does not grant the caster any special means of communication with the affected animal; if combined with *speak with beasts*, this spell becomes significantly more useful. A bewitchment can be detected with *discern bewitchment*,but cannot be detected with *discern magic*.

Once the spell ends, the affected animal will be hostile to the caster if it was forced to risk its life without fair reward or otherwise harmed or maltreated. A bewitched animal that was used kindly might remain neutral or friendly (Judge’s discretion).

At the start of its initiative, the vomiting creature suffers 1d12 extraordinary necrotic damage from its gory retching, then makes another Death saving throw. If the save succeeds, the spell ends. If the save fails, the target continues vomiting. The *bloody flux*continues until the effect is dispelled, the creature dies, or the creature successfully saves. The caster does not need to concentrate to maintain the effect.

###### Body Swap

Arcane 6 Type: necromancy, transmogrification

Range: touchDuration: perpetual

This spell can cause a pair of living targets of man-size or smaller to perpetually take on each other’s forms. Each target gains the physical capabilities, statistics, physical attacks, and special abilities of the new form while retaining its own mental abilities. Each target retains the same number of hit points it previously had, regardless of the Hit Dice of the form assumed.

Incorporeal and gaseous creatures cannot be targeted by this spell, nor can creatures with more HD than caster level. The caster must touch both creatures when casting the spell. The caster may be one of the creatures touched, if he desires. Since touching an unwilling creature requires a successful attack throw, this spell is usually cast only when one or both of the creatures are willing and/or helpless. Each creature can (if unwilling) make a Spells saving throw to resist the *body swap*. If either creature saves, the spell has no effect.

Once the *body swap*occurs, it lasts perpetually until the caster dies or it is **dispelled**. If dispelled, the two creatures immediately swap back to their original forms. If the *body swap*is dispelledafter one of the creatures has died, then the surviving creature must make a Death saving throw. If the throw fails, the creature returns to its original (dead) form and dies. If the save succeeds, the surviving creature retains the new form.

###### Boil Blood

Arcane 3 , Divine 5 Type: blast, elemental (fire)

Range: 225’Duration: instantaneous

If the save fails, the creature is **stunned** until the end of its next initiative and suffers 1d8 extraordinary fire damage per caster level (maximum 8d8). On a successful save the creature suffers half damage and is not stunned.

In either case, if the target is reduced to 0 hp or less by the spell, the creature detonates in an explosion of boiling blood, scalding puss, and melted organs. The explosion kills the target instantly. Each creature within 5’ of the exploding target must make a Blast saving throw. If the save fails, the creature suffers 1d6 extraordinary fire damage. If the save succeeds, the creature suffers half that damage. Theexplosion also damages objects in the area and sets combustible materials alight.

###### Burning Sparks

Arcane 2 Type: blast, elemental (fire)

###### Call of the Aerophract Steeds

Divine 6 Type: summoning (call)

Range: specialDuration: 1 day

This spell calls a herd of **pegasi** to the caster to serve as a steeds for him and his companions (see the ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual*** for details). Two pegasi will respond to the call per caster level. For instance, a 14th level caster will summon 28 pegasi.

The spell takes one turn (10 minutes) to cast. As soon as the spell is cast, the pegasi begin to travel from their den(s) to the caster’s destination at their expedition speed. Unless the Judge has placed a herd of pegasi nearby, the pegasi’s dens will be 4d10 6-mile hexes from the caster’s location. The pegasi will travel to the caster at a rate of 4 hexes per hour. The time to arrival might be much shorter if the Judge has determined that a herd of pegasi is nearby. If called while the caster is unreachable (deep in a dungeon, for example), the pegasi will travel as close as they can to the caster and then wait in that vicinity.

For the duration of the spell, the pegasi will understand the caster’s speech and serve as his loyal friends and companions, acting as if they were the caster’s henchman. They can be handled as mounts, war mounts, or work beasts as if trained in that role. The spell persists until the pegasi are slain, the spell is **dispelled**, or one day passes (at which time the pegasi depart). If the spell is cast again when the pegasi are about to depart, they will remain for another day.*Call of the aerophract steeds* can only be cast once per day.

This spell does notconjure up saddle and tack, nor does it automatically grant the rider the equivalent of Riding proficiency, so an unproficient character who rides the pegasi into battle does so at his own risk.

A prayerful caster who uses a *call* with ill intent towards the creatures called immediately becomes **disfavored.** He cannot use cast the spell again until he has restored himself to favor. A studious caster who uses a *call* with ill intent immediately loses the spell from his repertoire. (He can re-learn it if he has the formula.) In neither case does the called animal arrive.

###### Call of the Ancient Tusk

The spell takes one turn (10 minutes) to cast. As soon as the spell is cast, the mammoths begin to travel to the caster’s destination at their expedition speed. If the spell is cast in an unsettled hex of terrain with an indigenous mammoth or elephant population, the mammoths will take 1d6 turns to arrive. If the spell is cast in any other type of hex, the time to arrive is increased by 120 minutes (12 turns) per 6-mile hex between the caster’s hex and the nearest unsettled hex of native terrain. The time to arrival may be much shorter if the Judge has determined that a mammoth lair is nearby. If called while the caster is unreachable (deep in a dungeon, for example), the mammoths will travel as close as it can to the caster and then wait in that vicinity.

For the duration of the spell, the mammoths will understand the spellcaster’s speech and serve as his loyal friends and companions, acting as if it were the caster’s henchman. They can be ridden as mount or war mounts as if trained in that role.

If the spell is cast again when the mammoths are about to depart, they will remain for another day. *Call of the ancient tusk* can only be cast once per day.

This spell does notconjure up saddle and tack, nor does it automatically grant the rider the equivalent of Riding proficiency, so unproficient characters who ride the mammoth into battle do so at their own risk.

The time to arrival may be much shorter if the Judge has determined that a herd of horses is nearby.

For the duration of the spell, the horses will understand the caster’s speech and serve as his loyal friends and companions, acting as if they were the caster’s henchmen. They can be handled as mounts, war mounts, or workbeasts as if trained in the role.

If the spell is cast again when the horses are about to depart, they will remain for another day.*Call of the galloping herd* can only be cast once per day.

This spell does notconjure up saddle and tack, nor does it automatically grant the rider the equivalent of Riding proficiency, so unproficient characters who ride the horses into battle do so at their own risk.

###### Capsizing Wave

Arcane 5 Type: blast, elemental (water)

Range: 225’Duration: instantaneous

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Vessel Speed** | **Seafaring Throw** |
| 960’ or faster | 9+ |
| 900’ | 11+ |
| 840’ | 13+ |
| 780’ | 15+ |
| 720’ | 17+ |
| 640’ or slower | 19+ |

This spell can smash a target sea vessel with a *capsizing wave* capable of sinking even the largest sailing ships. On his initiative number, the captain of the target vessel can use an action in lieu of attacking to attempt to steer through the wave. Steering through the wave requires a Seafaring proficiency throw. The target value of the proficiency throw is based on the combat speed of the vessel, as shown on the accompanying table. Master mariners (characters with Seafaring rank 3) gain a +4 bonus on the throw.

If the captain’s proficiency throw succeeds, the vessel suffers 25 – 40 (1d4+4 x 5) bludgeoning structural damage. If the captain’s proficiency throw fails, or if the captain does not attempt to steer the vessel through the wave, the vessel is struck on its broadside by the wave. The vessel suffers 250 – 400 (1d4+4 x 50) bludgeoning structural damage and each crewmember or other creature on deck must make a Blast saving throw. If the save fails, the creature suffers 1d6 bludgeoning damage and is swept overboard. If the save succeeds, the creature takes no damage and remains on the deck. The wave vanishes back into the water as soon as its crest passes the target vessel.

A vessel reduced to 0 shp may no longer move under its own power or attack with any vessel-mounted weaponry, and will sink in 1d10 rounds. Any crew remaining on board may still attack with personal weapons during this time. When the vessel sinks, or when knocked overboard, crew must begin making swimming throws each round. See Swimming and Drowning (p. XX) for more details.

EXAMPLE: Ra-Ramses sees Raknar the Red-Handed sailing towards his island sanctum at the helm of his longship, the Red Viper (30 shp). When Raknar’s vessel gets to a range of 150’, Ra-Ramses smashes it with a *capsizing wave*. On Raknar’s initiative, he attempts to steer through the wave. Raknar’s longship is under sail with a sail speed of 720’. Therefore he must make a Seafaring proficiency throw with a target value of 17+. Fortunately, Raknar has three ranks of Seafaring proficiency, granting him a +5 bonus to the throw. Unfortunately, he rolls a 3, which still fails. The Red Viper is struck on its broadside and suffers 1d4+4 x 50 bludgeoning structural damage. Ra-Ramses rolls a 1, so the total is 250 shp. That reduces the longship to well below 0 shp, and it will sink in 1d10 rounds.

Meanwhile, Raknar and his 75 crew must each make a Blast saving throw. Those that fail suffer 1d6 bludgeoning damage and are swept overboard. Raknar’s ill-luck continues as he fails his saving throw. The barbarian is carried into the murky waters…

###### Carnage

Arcane 5 Type: death

Range: 225’Duration: instantaneous

This spell can massacre and maim one or more humanoid targets. Up to 4d8 HD of humanoids with fewer than 2 HD can be targeted by the spell. Creatures with less than 1 HD count as 1/2 HD each. Creatures with the fewest HD must be targeted first. The caster does not have to use the full HD available. Any excess HD of effectiveness are lost. When one or more creatures with the same number of HD are eligible to be targets, the caster can choose which are affected.

Each target humanoid must make a Death saving throw. If the save fails, the target is instantly torn apart in a shower of blood and gore. If the save succeeds, the target suffers 2d4 extraordinary necrotic damage and must immediately roll on the Savage Mortal Woundstable and suffer the result listed under Permanent Wounds Suffered. (The target does not suffer from the results listed in the Condition & Recovery column.) When rolling on the Mortal Wound table due to *carnage*, the only modifiers that apply are those from CON and HD.

Note that this spell indiscriminately slaughters its targets. It does not afford the caster any way to differentiate friend from foe except insofar as he chooses to use fewer than the full HD available or he has two creatures as eligible targets with the same HD and not enough excess HD to affect them both.

EXAMPLE: Ra-Ramses is a 14th level mage, accompanied by his 0th level henchmen Thotep and his 1st level henchman Flavian. Ra-Ramses and his henchmen enter an open-air marketplace where 46 0th-level merchants are offering goods, supervised by one 1st level fighter. Ra-Ramses decides it would be easier to massacre them all than to barter for the goods he wants, so he casts *carnage*. After completing the spell, Ra-Ramses rolls 4d8, scoring an exceptional 5, 5, 7, and 8 on the dice. A total of 25 HD of creatures can be targeted. Ra-Ramses must target the creatures with fewest HD first, but can choose between eligible targets with the same HD. He first targets the 46 0th level merchants. That uses up 23 of his 25 HD of creatures. He’d like to target the 1st level fighter guarding the market place, but to do so he would first have to target 0th level Thotep. Ra-Ramses graciously accepts Thotep’s sacrifice for the cause and targets the hapless henchmen. Ra-Ramses has now used 23 1/2 of his 25 HD. He now targets the fighter, which uses up another 1/2 of his 25 HD. He has only 1/2 HD remaining, which is not enough to target anyone else. The excess 1/2 HD is wasted.

###### Chameleon

Arcane 1 Type: transmogrification

Range: touchDuration: 1 turn/caster level

This spell allows the recipient to blend into its surroundings to the point of becoming nearly invisible. If the creature is not proficient in Hiding, it becomes proficient with a Hiding proficiency throw of 12+. If the creature is already proficient in Hiding, it gains a +8 bonus to its Hiding proficiency throws. The recipient must be man-sized or smaller when this spell is cast or it fails to work.

###### Chimerical Figment

Arcane 3 , Divine 5 Type: illusion

Range: 360’Duration: concentration + 2 rounds

This spell creates the visual and auditory illusion of an area, object, creature, or force, as visualized by the caster, up to a maximum size of 30’ x 30’ x 30’. The illusion does not create smell, texture, or temperature. The caster can move the figment within the limits of the area of the effect. The image persists so long as the caster maintains concentration, plus an additional 2 rounds after the caster ceases to concentrate, expiring at the end of the caster’s second initiative.

If used to create the illusion of one or more creatures, the illusory creatures have AC 0 and 1 hp; they immediately disappear if hit in combat. If used to simulate an attack spell or an attacking creature, the illusory attack and damage done should be resolved by the Judge as if it were real. However, any creature affected by illusory damage receives a Spells saving throw to disbelieve the illusion (with a bonus for any senses lacking, see below). If the save succeeds, the creature takes no damage and realizes the *chimerical figment* is an illusion. If the save fails, the creature believes it has been damaged, possibly fainting into unconsciousness if it believes its hit points have been reduced to 0 or fewer. However, the illusory damage is not real. A “killed” or “injured” creature realizes it is unharmed at the end of its initiative in 1d3 rounds, and thereafter knows the *chimerical figment*is an illusion.

A creature who encounters a *chimerical figment* and has reason to be suspicious about its reality can make a Spells saving throw to disbelieve it at the start of its initiative. The creature gains a +4 bonus if the area, object, creature, or force being simulated should have smell, texture, or temperature, provided the creature can tell the figment does not have those qualities. If the save succeeds, the creature confirms the *chimerical**figment* is an illusion and can see and hear anything the figment is concealing. If the save fails, the creature continues to believe it is real. The creature cannot attempt to disbelieve the *chimerical**figment*again until it has further evidence of its illusory nature (e.g. a friend tells him “it’s an illusion,” he discovers it lacks temperature, etc.).

###### Choking Grip

Arcane 1 , Divine 2 Type: death

Range: 45’Duration: special

This spell can place an invisible grip around the throat of a living target. The target must make a Death saving throw. If the save succeeds, the target resists the spell. If the save fails, the target begins **choking**. It immediately suffers 1d6 extraordinary necrotic damage and thereafter cannot take any actions or speak (although it can still defend itself) until the *choking**grip*ends.

When the caster’s next initiative number comes up, if the caster maintains concentration on the spell, then the choking target must make another Death saving throw. If the save succeeds, the spell ends. If the save fails, the target continues **choking**. It suffers another 1d6 extraordinary necrotic damage and still cannot take any action. The *choking grip* lasts until **dispelled**, the caster stops concentrating upon it, or the target makes a successful saving throw and ends the spell.

The target of this spell must be a living animal, giant, humanoid, monstrosity, or other creature that respirates through a windpipe. If cast on another type of living creature, such as an ooze or vermin, the spell automatically fails.

###### Circle of Agony

Arcane 5 Type: death

Range: 45’Duration: indefinite

This spell can inflict agonizing pain on one, two, three, four, or five living target(s) of the caster’s choice. Each target must make a Death saving throw. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect on the target. If the save fails, the target becomes **helpless** with agony.

At the start of its initiative, each creature made helpless by this spell suffers 1d4 extraordinary necrotic damage from body-wracking pain and then makes another Death saving throw. If the save succeeds, the spell ends for that creature. If the save fails, the creature remains helpless. The effects of a *circle of agony*continue until **dispelled**, orthe target(s) either die(s) or successfully save(s). The caster does not need to concentrate to maintain the effects.

###### Circling Winds

Arcane 2 , Divine 2 Type: elemental (air), protection, wall

Range: selfDuration: concentration

This spell raises a sphere of howling winds that surround the caster at a 10’ radius. Any creatures that start their initiative or move within 5’ of the exterior of the *circling winds* are subject to attack as if from a readied 2 HD monster with one attack dealing 1d8 extraordinary slashing damage. Any creatures that attempt to pass into the *circling**winds* must make a Paralysis saving throw or be forced back 5’ from the nearest edge. (Creatures of Large size or greater gain a +4 bonus to the saving throw per size category above man-sized.) The *circling**winds* do not attack or force back creatures inside the radius of the spell.

The *circling**winds* deflect missile attacks dealing mundane damage which are directed at the caster or other creatures inside the radius of the spell. Missile attacks include, e.g., arrows, boulders, bolts, bullets, and thrown objects. The deflected missile attacks automatically miss their target. If the deflected attack has an area of effect, roll for scatter to determine the direction and distance deflected (see p. XX for scatter). Creatures within the *circling**winds* can still be harmed if they ends up in the area of effect after deflection. Attacks made with silver weapons are considered to deal extraordinary damage for purposes of this spell.

The *circling**winds*do not block missile attacks made by creatures inside the winds, nor do they prevent creatures inside the winds from exiting. The *circling**winds*can be evoked so that they appear where creatures already are. Affected creatures must make a Blast saving throw. If the save succeeds, the creature can dive into or out of the *circling**winds*(its choice) without being harmed. If the save fails, the creature is attacked as above and then forced back 5’ from the nearest edge of the circling winds.

The *circling**winds* spell lasts as long as the caster maintains stationary concentration or until **dispelled**.

###### Clairaudiency

Arcane 3 , Divine 3 Type: detection

Range: 90’Duration: 12 turns

This spell enables the caster to hear the sounds in another area through the ears of a living target in that area. The spell can be cast in one of two ways:

* The caster can specify a point in space in a given direction and distance, up to a maximum of 90’ away. The point does not need to be in line of sight. The closest living creature to that point within 90’ of the caster becomes the target. If there is no living creature within 90’ of the caster, the spell automatically fails.
* The caster can specify a living creature in range and line of sight. That creature becomes the target of the spell.

The target does not receive a saving throw and is unaware that it is being used by the caster. Once If the target moves out of range of the caster, the caster can no longer hear sounds through its ears, but can choose another target in this case. Otherwise, once per turn, the caster can choose another target for the spell, using either of the methods above, thereby enabling multiple locations to be heard.

The caster must concentrate to use *clairaudiency***,** and he cannot hear sounds through his own ears while doing so. However, the spell does not end if he stops concentrating, so he can revert to hearing with his own ears if necessary, then resume concentration thereafter. *Clairaudiency* does not function through barriers of lead or gold, but is otherwise unaffected by intervening material.

If the caster has a familiar, his familiar is always considered to be in range for purposes of *clairaudiency*, with only a barrier of gold or lead being able to block him from hearing through its ears.

###### Clairaudiency, Greater

Arcane 6, Divine 6 Type: detection

Range: 500 milesDuration: concentration

This spell enables the caster to hear the sounds in another area through the ears of a selected type of living creatures, such as bats, hawks, or rats. The caster must specify the direction and approximate distance, up to a maximum of 500 miles away, of the first creature he wishes to *clairaudiently* contact. If there is no appropriate creature in that area, the next closest creature of the appropriate type will be contacted instead.

The target does not receive a saving throw and is unaware that it is being used by the caster. If the target moves out of range of the caster, the caster can no longer hear sounds through its ears, but can choose another target in this case. Otherwise, once each turn, the caster can choose another target for the spell, thereby enabling multiple locations to be heard. *Greater**clairaudiency* does not function through barriers of lead or gold, but is otherwise unaffected by intervening material.

The caster must concentrate to use *clairaudiency***,** and he cannot hear sounds through his own ears while doing so. The spell ends when he stops concentrating. This spell is difficult to cast, taking one full turn, and is so draining that it can be used but once per day.

###### Clairvoyancy

Arcane 3 , Divine 3 Type: detection

Range: 90’Duration: 12 turns

This spell enables the caster to see into another area through the eyes of a living creature in that area. Apart from permitting the caster to experience sight rather than sound, it is otherwise identical to *clairaudiency*.

###### Clairvoyancy, Greater

Arcane 6, Divine 6 Type: detection

Range: 500 milesDuration: concentration

This spell enables the caster to see into other areas through the eyes of a selected type of living creatures, such as bats, hawks, or rats. Apart from permitting the caster to experience sight rather than sound, it is otherwise identical to *greater**clairaudiency*.

###### Cloud of Poison

Arcane 4 Type: elemental (air), wall

Range: specialDuration: 6 turns

This spell draws together a *cloud**of**poison*from the foul miasmas of the atmosphere. Because the spell draws its power from natural miasmas, it can only be cast outdoors or in a ventilated room. The *cloud* is 30’ in diameter and spreads out from the caster’s fingertips. Each round thereafter, at the start of the caster’s initiative, the *cloud* moves 20’ away from the caster. The *cloud**of**poison*is heavier than air and will sink down holes or slide downhill; it is broken up by trees or thick vegetation.

Any creature that begins its initiative in or enters the *cloud**of**poison*must make a Death saving throw. If the save fails, the creature dies if it has fewer than 5 Hit Dice, and takes 1 extraordinary poisonous damage if it has 5 HD or more. If the save succeeds, the creature takes 1 extraordinary poisonous damage. (Creatures of 5 HD or more thus always just take 1 extraordinary poisonous damage). The *cloud* persists until **dispelled** by magic, dispersed by strong winds, or 6 turns elapse.

###### Communion

Divine 5 Type: detection, esoteric

Range: 0’Duration: 3 rounds

This spell allows the caster to ask a herald of his deity to answer three yes-or-no questions. The herald might be an angel, demigod, divine hero, or saint of the deity, but is almost never the deity himself (Judge’s discretion). The caster can ask the herald one question per round, and receives the answer immediately thereafter in the form of direct and intuitive knowledge. The herald is wise and well-informed in all matters relating to his deity’s sphere of influence, but is not omniscient. The herald cannot predict the future and his ability to answer questions about current or past events can be confounded by the will of rival gods or heralds. These details are left to the Judge’s discretion. The lengthy prayers required to cast this spell take 1 turn to complete, and can be performed but once per week. Once a year, upon the patron deity’s holiest day, the caster can ask twice the normal number of questions over the course of 6 rounds.

###### Cone of Fear

Arcane 4, Divine 5 Type: enchantment

Range: 0’Duration: 1 turn

This spell produces a 60’ long and 30’ wide cone of fear stretching from the caster’s hands. Each living creature within the cone must make a Paralysis saving throw. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect on that creature. If the save fails, the creature becomes **frightened** for the duration of the spell, or until the effect is **dispelled** normally,or by*remove fear*.

A frightened creature cannot attack, cast spells, or speak (except to scream in stark terror). A frightened creature will run from the source of its fear at its full speed for the duration of the spell. If a frightened creature cannot flee, it will **cower** in terror. An **engaged** creature that is frightened will cower in terror until it is able to disengage with defensive movement. It suffers a -2 penalty to AC and cannot attack, cast spells, move, or take any other actions until the condition ends.

###### Cone of Frost

Arcane 3 Type: blast, elemental (water)

Range: 0’Duration: instantaneous

This spell conjures a cone of freezing water 60’ long and 30’ wide stretching from the caster’s hands. Each creature within the cone must make a Blast saving throw. If the save fails, the creature suffers 1d4 extraordinary cold damage per caster level. If the save succeeds, the creature suffers half that damage.

The*cone of frost* can also damage structures in its area of effect. It deals up to 1d4 extraordinary cold structural damage per caster level to wooden structures and one-fifth that damage to stone structures. (It might deal less if the structure is not entirely in its area of effect.) Any non-magical fires (burning pitch, campfires, torches, etc.) within the cone are automatically extinguished.

###### Cone of Paralysis

Arcane 5 Type: enchantment

Range: 0’Duration: instantaneous

This spell produces a 60’ long and 30’ wide cone of **paralysis** stretching from the caster’s hands. Each creature within the cone must make a Paralysis saving throw. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect on the creature. If the save fails, the creature becomes **paralyzed** for 6 turns.

###### Conflagration

Arcane 6 Type: blast, elemental (fire)

Range: 360’ Duration: instantaneous

This spell conjures a massive conflagration 10’ high and 60’ in diameter. When he casts the spell, the caster designates a target point for the conflagration. Both the caster and the target point must be outdoors. After designating the target point, the caster makes an attack throw against AC 0. If the throw succeeds, the conflagration is centered upon the target point. If the throw fails with an unmodified roll of 1, the conflagration is centered upon the caster. On any other result, the center of the conflagration scatters by 1d3 x 60’ from the target point. The Judge rolls 1d12 to determine the direction of scatter, applied as a clock direction from the target point. Each creature within the conflagration — wherever it ends up — must make a saving throw. If the save fails, the creature suffers 2d6+2 extraordinary fire damage. If the save succeeds, the creature suffers half that damage.

The*conflagration* can also damage structures in its area of effect. It deals up to 2d6+2 x 10 extraordinary fire structural damage to wooden structures and 2d6+2 x 2 extraordinary fire structural damage to stone structures. (It might deal less if the structure is not entirely in its area of effect.) The*conflagration*causes combustibles (such as military oil or petards) to ignite. Because of its huge area of effect, creatures sheltering behind an arrow loop or battlement do not gain the usual protection from a *conflagration*. Creatures sheltering inside an enclosed structure are not damaged unless the interposing structure is destroyed, however.

This spell was created for battlefield use. Its huge area of effect allows it to instantly destroy a company of 120 troops. At battlefield ranges, a conflagration that scatters is usually harmless, sometimes helpful, and occasionally disastrous.

###### Conjure Cacodemon Spawn

Arcane 1 Type: summoning (conjuration)

Range: 360’Duration: 6 turns

This spell opens a portal to the Outer Darkness, allowing the spellcaster to conjure a **cacodemon spawn** with 2 HD and two special abilities (see the ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual*** for details). Only one cacodemon spawn can be conjured by the caster in a given day. The cacodemon spawn will appear at the end of his initiative at a point chosen by the caster within his line of sight and spell range and can begin to act on the caster’s initiative on the following round.

Once the cacodemon appears, it serves the caster for up to one hour (6 turns), provided that the caster maintains concentration on controlling the creature. Spell casting, combat, or movement over half the normal rate results in loss of concentration. The caster, while in control of the cacodemon spawn, can dismiss it to its native sphere at will (doing so at the start of his initiative if in combat). The cacodemon cannot be controlled outside the range of the spell.

If the caster loses concentration, or the cacodemon is somehow forced out of range of the caster, control of the cacodemon is lost and cannot be regained. The creature then seeks to attack the caster and all others in its path. Only *counterspell, dispel magic*, or *dispel evil* can banish the cacodemon once control has been lost. An uncontrolled cacodemon might, of course, choose to return to its home sphere on its own; such creatures will never choose to remain away from their sphere of existence for long.

Cacodemons are highly variable in form and abilities. The first time this spell is cast, the caster should choose the form of the cacodemon spawn conjured, while the Judge should roll or choose its special abilities. The cacodemon spawn should then be assigned a name for later reference. Thereafter, the caster can choose to conjure any named spawn he has previously conjured and safely dispelled, or conjure a new spawn with a different form and special abilities.

EXAMPLE: The first time Ra-Ramses conjures a cacodemon spawn, he selects the monadine form. The Judge determines it has the special abilities of swallow attack and grab and assigns it the name Ixubix the Enveloping Horror. Ra-Ramses uses Ixubix to envelop and dissolve a rival for power in the local temple, then dismisses it. Because he safely dismissed Ixubix, he can conjure it again in the future. The second time Ra-Ramses conjures a spawn, he can conjure either Ixubix or a new spawn. He chooses to conjure Ixubix. Unfortunately, on this casting Ixubix is destroyed in combat. Because Ixubix was destroyed rather than safely dispelled, Ra-Ramses cannot conjure it again.

###### Conjure Dybbuk

Arcane 5 Type: summoning (conjuration)

Range: 360’Duration: 6 turns

This spell opens a portal to the Outer Darkness, allowing the spellcaster to conjure a **dybbuk** with 14 HD and three special abilities (see the ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual*** for details). Only one dybbuk may be conjured by the caster in a given day. Once the dybbuk appears, it serves the caster for up to one hour (6 turns), provided that the caster maintains concentration on controlling the creature. This spell is otherwise identical to *conjure cacodemon spawn*.

###### Conjure Fiend

Arcane 6 Type: summoning (conjuration)

Range: 360’Duration: 6 turns

This spell opens a portal to the Outer Darkness, allowing the spellcaster to conjure a **fiend** with 18 HD and four special abilities (see the ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual*** for details). Only one fiend may be conjured by the caster in a given day. Once the fiend appears, it serves the caster for up to one hour (6 turns), provided that the caster maintains concentration on controlling the creature. This spell is otherwise identical to *conjure cacodemon spawn*.

###### Conjure Genie

Arcane 6 Type: summoning (conjuration), elemental

Range: 360’Duration: 1 day

This spell opens a portal to one of the Elemental Spheres of Air, Earth, Fire, or Water, allowing the spellcaster to conjure a genie from that sphere. (See the ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual*** for details on Djinn, Hafar, Marid and Efreet.) Only one genie of each type can be conjured by the caster in a given day. The genie will appear at the end of his initiative at a point chosen by the caster within his line of sight and spell range and can begin to act on the caster’s initiative on the following round.

Once the genie appears, it serves the caster for up to one day, provided that the caster maintains concentration on controlling the creature. Spell casting, combat, or movement over half the normal rate results in loss of concentration. The caster, while in control of the genie, can dismiss it to its native sphere at will (doing so the start of his initiative if in combat). The genie cannot be controlled outside the range of the spell.

If the caster loses concentration, or the genie is somehow forced out of range of the caster, control of the conjured genie is lost and cannot be regained. The creature then seeks to attack the caster and all others in its path. Only *counterspell*, *dispel magic*,or *dispel evil* can banish the genie once control has been lost. An uncontrolled genie might, of course, choose to return to its home sphere on its own; such creatures will never choose to remain away from their sphere of existence for long. A conjured genie is not under sufficient control to be forced to cast *wish*.

###### Conjure Hellion

Arcane 3 Type: summoning (conjuration)

Range: 360’Duration: 6 turns

A portal to the Outer Darkness is opened, allowing the spellcaster to conjure a **hellion** with 8 HD and two special abilities (see the ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual*** for details). Only one hellion may be conjured by the caster in a given day. Once the hellion appears, it serves the caster for up to one hour (6 turns), provided that the caster maintains concentration on controlling the creature. This spell is otherwise identical to *conjure cacodemon spawn*.

###### Conjure Imp

Arcane 2 Type: summoning (conjuration)

Range: 360’Duration: 6 turns

This spell opens a portal to the Outer Darkness, allowing the spellcaster to conjure an **imp** with 4 HD and two special abilities (see the ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual*** for details). Only one imp may be conjured by the caster in a given day. Once the imp appears, it serves the caster for up to one hour (6 turns), provided that the caster maintains concentration on controlling the creature. This spell is otherwise identical to *conjure cacodemon spawn*.

###### Conjure Incubus

Arcane 4 Type: summoning (conjuration)

Range: 360’Duration: 6 turns

This spell opens a portal to the Outer Darkness, allowing the spellcaster to conjure an **incubus** with 10 HD and three special abilities (see the ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual*** for details). Only one incubus may be conjured by the caster in a given day. Once the incubus appears, it serves the caster for up to one hour (6 turns) provided that the caster maintains concentration on controlling the creature. This spell is otherwise identical to *conjure cacodemon spawn*.

###### Conjure Major Elemental

Arcane 4 Type: elemental (any), summoning (conjuration)

Range: 360’Duration: 6 turns + 1 turn/caster level

This spell opens a portal to one of the Elemental Spheres of Air, Earth, Fire, or Water, allowing the spellcaster to conjure a **12 HD elemental** from that sphere (see the ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual*** for details). Only one major elemental of each type can be conjured by the caster each day. The element will appear at the end of his initiative at a point chosen by the caster within his line of sight and spell range and can begin to act on the caster’s initiative on the following round.

Once the elemental appears, it serves the caster for up to 6 turns + 1 turn per caster level, provided that the caster maintains concentration on controlling it. Spell casting, combat, or movement over half the normal rate results in loss of concentration. The caster, while in control of an elemental, can dismiss it to its native sphere at will (doing so at the start of his Initiative if in combat). The elemental cannot be controlled outside the range of the caster.

If the caster loses concentration, or the elemental is somehow forced out of range of the caster, control of the conjured elemental is lost and cannot be regained. The creature then seeks to attack the caster and all others in its path. Only *counterspell*, *dispel magic*,or *dispel evil* can banish the elemental once control has been lost. An uncontrolled elemental might, of course, choose to return to its home sphere on its own; such creatures will never choose to remain away from their sphere of existence for long.

###### Conjure Petty Elemental

Arcane 2 Type: elemental (any), summoning (conjuration)

Range: 360’Duration: 6 turns + 1 turn/caster level

This spell opens a portal to one of the Elemental Spheres of Air, Earth, Fire, or Water, allowing the spellcaster to conjure a **4 HD elemental** from that sphere (see the ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual*** for details). Only one petty elemental of each type can be conjured by the caster each day. This spell is otherwise identical to *conjure major elemental*.

###### Conjure Supreme Elemental

Arcane 5 Type: elemental (any), summoning (conjuration)

Range: 360’Duration: 6 turns + 1 turn/caster level

This spell opens a portal to one of the Elemental Spheres of Air, Earth, Fire, or Water, allowing the spellcaster to conjure a **16 HD elemental** from that sphere (see the ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual*** for details). Only one supreme elemental of each type can be conjured by the caster each day. This spell is otherwise identical to *conjure major elemental*.

###### Contact Other Sphere

Arcane 5 Type: detection, esoteric

Range: selfDuration: special

This spell sends the caster’s mind to a distant sphere of existence, where he can receive advice and information from one of the great powers that dwells therein, such as an angel, demon, demigod, elemental, or even a true god. When the spell is cast, the caster chooses which sphere he wishes to contact. Each sphere has different types of entities of greater or less availability, reliability, and danger. The spheres are:

*Celestial:* The caster contacts entities on other worlds within his own celestial sphere, separated from his world by vast gulfs of black void. Celestial entities are relatively safe to contact and are relatively responsive and truthful.

*Elemental:* The caster contacts one of the alien beings of raw elemental power that exist in the spheres of air, earth, fire, and water. Elemental beings are generally responsive and very truthful, but their alien thought patterns pose a risk to the caster’s soul.

*Chthonic:* The caster contacts one of the chaotic entities that dwells in the Chthonic Darkness. Chthonic beings are eager to entice the ambitious and powerful and are highly responsive, although not particularly truthful. Because of the long traditions of contact between humanity and these powers, they are relatively safe to contact.

*Empyrean:* The caster contacts one of the lawful entities that dwells in the Empyrean Heaven. Though benevolent, empyrean beings tend to concern themselves with the high patterns of providence and rarely respond to the individual petitions of mortals. Because of the long traditions of contact between humanity and these powers, they are relatively safe to contact.

|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Sphere | Responsive | Truthful | Modifier | Alignment |
| Celestial | 65% | 65% | Death +4 | Caster’s |
| Elemental | 75% | 90% | Death -2 | Neutral |
| Chthonic | 90% | 45% | Death +4 | Chaotic |
| Empyrean | 33% | 99% | Death +4 | Lawful |
| Outer Darkness | 99% | 99% | Death -8 | Chaotic |

*Outer Darkness:* The caster contacts one of the eldritch horrors that dwells in the Outer Darkness between the spheres. The horrors of the Outer Darkness are always watching and waiting to speak with those who dare contact them, and when they speak they offer truth, no matter how terrible it might be. The spiritual risk of contacting the Outer Darkness is incredibly high and only the most foolish and desperate mages attempt it.

While these spheres are based on the Auran Empire campaign setting, the Judge can assign these values to other planes of existence, alternative dimensions, and so on as appropriate to his campaign setting.

The caster may ask one question per two caster levels. He may ask questions at the rate of one per round; each question is answered by the contacted power during the same round. The powers reply in a language the caster understands. Each time a question is asked, the Judge rolls on the adjoining table to see if the power responds to the question and then rolls again to see if the power answers truthfully. The caster can ask the same question repeatedly if desired. The caster must concentrate on maintaining the spell while asking questions, but he does not have to continue asking questions if he has learned what he wishes. Some questions reduce his number of available questions by more than one.

When contacting another sphere, the following types of questions can be asked:

* The command word for a magic item. The magic item must be either in the caster’s possession or be a unique named item.
* The location of a supreme place of power related to the sphere contacted. The caster will learn the direction and approximate distance to the place of power as well as a very short description of that location.
* The location of a very rare or legendary magic item. The caster will learn the direction and approximate distance to the item as well as a very short description of that location.
* The formula for an arcane spell. Asking this question reduces the number of available questions left by the spell’s level.
* The formula for a construct or magic item. Asking this question reduces the number of available questions left by the magic item’s base cost / 20,000gp.
* The true name of a cacodemon he would like to summon. Asking this question reduces the number of available questions left by the cacodemon’s HD / 3.

The Judge can permit other types of questions at his discretion. Immediately after asking each question, the caster must make a Death saving throw, applying the modifier shown on the adjoining table, to see if he suffers spiritual harm from his contact with another sphere. If the save succeeds, the caster’s soul remains intact. If the save fails, the caster must roll on the Tampering with Mortality table for the alignment shown on the table above and suffer whatever side effect results. When rolling on the Tampering with Mortality table, the only modifier that applies is the caster’s WIL modifier. The caster can continue to ask questions even if he suffers a side effect, and can suffer multiple side effects during one series of questions.

Arcane 6 Type: elemental (air), esoteric

Range: self Duration: stationary concentration

The caster can conjure and control the weather conditions in an outdoor area of effect around himself with a 720’ radius area of effect. When the spell is cast, the caster chooses one weather condition. The caster can thereafter create or end one additional weather condition on his initiative each round. If a weather condition contradicts or ends an existing condition, the existing condition is ended and replaced. The available weather conditions and their effects are summarized below. The effects of weather caused by *control weather*occur instantly rather than taking an hour or day to occur, but they are otherwise identical to the weather conditions found in Chapter 6, **Weathering the Wild**(p. XX – XX).

If two or more casters *control weather* in partially or completely overlapping areas of effect, the area of effect of the spell is extended to encompass all of the overlapping areas of effect. All the conditions in all areas are applied, with contradictions resolved in favor of the higher caster level(s). Each caster thereafter retains the ability to create or end one weather condition on his initiative. It is not unheard of for powerful high-level spellcasters to struggle to control weather over the course of a battle, alternatively subjecting the troops to scorching heat, freezing cold, and sudden tornadoes.

This spell can be sustained for as long as the caster remains stationary and concentrating.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Condition | Effect |
| Frigid | Expedition speed halved. Creatures without protective clothing or who get wet immediately become hypothermic and lose 1d3 CON per hour and must immediately make a Death saving throw or become frostbitten. Mud freezes instantly. -2 penalty to Seduction rolls. |
| Moderate | Frigid or sweltering conditions ended instantaneously. |
| Sweltering | Expedition speed halved. Creatures in heavy armor must immediately make Death saving throws or become fatigued. Water ration increased by 25% and Dehydration causes double CON loss. Snow melts and mud dries instantly (unlike sweltering weather from natural causes, which takes one day to melt snow or dry mud.) |
| Fair | Foggy, rainy, snowy, stormy, windy, or tornado conditions ended instantaneously. |
| Foggy | Maximum visibility drops to 20’. Speeds of all creatures are halved except for those which do not rely on sight to function. |
| Rainy | All missile attacks suffer a -2 penalty. Mud forms in 1 turn; thereafter, land speeds are halved except on paved roads; wheeled vehicles cannot move at all except on paved roads. |
| Snowy | Maximum visibility drops to 20’. Speeds of all creatures are halved. Snow accumulates in 1 turn; thereafter, land speeds are halved (again) and wheeled vehicles cannot move. |
| Stormy | All missile attacks and listening throws suffer a -4 penalty. Air speed is halved. Expedition speed is halved. All creatures are affected as if by *gale of wind.* In barren or desert terrain, maximum visibility is reduced to 20’ by dust. Vessels at sea might be damaged or drift (see p. XX). |
| Windy | All missile attacks and listening throws suffer a -2 penalty. Air speed is halved. Expedition speed is halved. |
| Tornado | A 100’ tall, 25’ diameter tornado appears at a point of the caster’s choice within the area of effect. The tornado blocks line of sight and missiles and magic cannot pass through it. On his initiative, the caster can move the tornado within the area of effect at a rate of 120’ per round. Any creatures that the tornado moves onto during the caster’s initiative, or that enters the tornado on its own initiative, are attacked as if from a readied 2 HD monster with one attack dealing 1d8 extraordinary slashing damage. After the attack, the creature must make a successful Paralysis saving throw or be knocked **prone** and flung back 5’ from the edge of the tornado. (Creatures of Large size or greater gain a +4 bonus to the saving throw per size category above man-sized.) Before summoning a tornado, a caster must first establish stormy conditions. |

###### Control Winds

Arcane 5, Divine 5 Type: elemental (air), esoteric

Range: 10’/levelDuration: 1 turn/caster level

This spell enables the caster to manipulate the flow of air within range and line of sight. He can control both the direction and speed of wind. Wind speed in ***ACKS II*** is rated as still, gentle, moderate, strong, very strong, and gale. To change wind direction by one point of sail or by one speed category requires the caster to concentrate for one round. The caster does not need to concentrate to maintain the spell, only to change the wind speed or direction.

When used at sea, *control winds*can increase or decrease vessel speed, depending on if the vessel is sailing with or against the wind. The spell can exclusively affect the caster’s vessel, and/or can affect one or more other vessels within range, as the caster chooses. See **Sailing the Seas** in Chapter 12 (p. XX) for details on the effects of wind speed and direction. .

If the caster increases the wind speed to very strong, the local weather conditions become windy (p. XX). All missile attack throws and Listening proficiency throws suffer a -2 penalty. Adventurers in windy conditions have their expedition speed halved. Air speed is halved in any terrain in windy conditions. In barrens or desert terrain only, visibility is reduced to 20’, all speeds are halved, and Land Surveying, Navigation, Searching, and Tracking proficiency throws all suffer -4 penalties due to sandstorms and dust clouds.

If the caster increases the wind speed to gale, the local weather conditions become stormy (p. XX). All missile attack throws and Listening proficiency throws suffer a -4 penalty. The force of the windautomatically extinguishes any candles, torches, or other unprotected flames. It extinguishes protected flames unless the bearer succeeds on a Paralysis saving throw. All characters are affected each round as if by the spell *gale of wind.* In barrens or desert terrain only, visibility is reduced to 20’ and Land Surveying, Navigation, Searching, and Tracking proficiency throws all suffer -4 penalties due to sandstorms and dust clouds.

###### Counterspell

Arcane 1, Divine 1 Type: protection

Range: 180’Duration: instantaneous

This spell enables the caster to extinguish a single ongoing spell or spell-like effect that has been cast on a target creature or object. If *counterspell* is used on a willing creature, or on an object held by a willing creature, the caster can choose which spell or effect to target. If *counterspell*is used on an unwilling creature, or on an object held by an unwilling creature, the creature must make a Spells saving throw. If the save succeeds, the *counterspell*has no effect. If the save fails, one random spell or effect on the creature becomes the target of the spell.

Once the target spell is determined, the caster must make an attack throw versus the spell or spell-like effect, treating it as a creature with an armor class equal to the difference in caster level between the creator of the spell or effect and the caster. If this attack throw succeeds, the spell or effect is extinguished. If this attack throw fails, the *counterspell* has no effect.

Some spells and effects cannot be ended by *counterspell***.** These include spells or effects that are not cast on creatures or objects, **curse** spells or effects, **petrification** spells or effects, and *quest*spells or effects, as well as magic items with effects of permanent duration and diseases caused by spells or effects. *Counterspell* can be used to extinguish spells or effects on a creature or object made permanent by ritual magic only if the caster is of higher level than whoever made the effect permanent.

###### Crafting

Divine 4 Type: transmogrification

Range: touchDuration: indefinite

This spell grants the recipient one additional rank of Art or Craft proficiency for purposes of completing one project (e.g. forging one sword, painting one painting, composing one song). Unproficient characters become apprentices, apprentices become journeymen, journeymen become masters, masters become grand masters, and grand masters become capable of creating magic items at twice the base time and cost of a mage of their class level. The spell expires when the recipient completes the project or when a day passes without the recipient working on the project for at least 8 hours. The recipient must be man-sized or smaller when this spell is cast or it fails to work.

###### Create Chasm

Arcane 3 Type: elemental (earth), wall

Range: 90’Duration: perpetual

This spell causes a 500 square foot area of earth within range to collapse into a 10’ deep chasm. The chasm can be created underfoot of creatures if desired. Each creature in the area of effect must make a Blast saving throw. If the save succeeds, the creature leaps to the nearest safe point. If the save fails, the creature falls into the chasm, suffering 1d6 bludgeoning damage if not otherwise protected (e.g. by flight or levitation). Unattended objects automatically fall into the chasm. *Create**chasm*can only affect volumes of soil, sand, silt, clay, or uncut, unworked rock. The spell does not function on worked stone, wood, cement, concrete, metal, or magical material.

The chasm created by this spell can be re-filled manually. Otherwise the chasm lasts until the spell is dispelled or until the caster dies or decides to stop sustaining it at the start of his turn. When the spell ends, if the chasm has not been filled manually, the earth bubbles upward violently and reforms. Each creature within the chasm must make a Blast saving throw. If the save succeeds, the creature is safely deposited on the surface. If the save fails, the creature suffers 1d6 extraordinary seismic damage from the roiling tremor before being deposited on the surface and knocked **prone**.

###### Create Food

Divine 5 Type: esoteric

Range: 10’Duration: instantaneous

This spell creates 300 lbs of food, enough to feed one platoon of 15 cavalry and mounts or one company of 120 infantry for one day. For each caster level above 9th, the caster is able to create another 300 lbs of food. The created food appears on a flat surface within range and line of sight of the caster. The created food is simple fare of the caster’s choice, highly nourishing but rather bland. The created food decays and becomes inedible within 24 hours, although it can be kept fresh for another 24 hours by casting *purify**food**and**water* on it. This spell can only be cast once per day.

###### Create Water

Divine 4 Type: esoteric

Range: 10’Duration: instantaneous

This spell summons forth an enchanted spring from the ground or wall that will provide 50 gallons of water, enough for one platoon of 15 cavalry and mounts or one company of 120 infantry to stay hydrated for one day. For each caster level above 7th, the caster is able to create another 50 gallons of water. The created water appears anywhere within range and line of sight of the caster. The water created by this spell is just like clean rainwater. Note that one or more vessels to contain the water must be available at the time of casting. Water weighs about 1 stone per gallon; one cubic foot of water is roughly 8 gallons. This spell can only be cast once per day.

###### Cure Blindness\*

Divine 3 Type: healing

Range: touchDuration: instantaneous

This spell cures a living recipient of **blindness** caused by permanent wounds, death magic, and/or reversed healing magic. However, **blindness** caused by a curse cannot be cured by this spell.

The reverse of this spell, *cause blindness,* can instantly blind a living target with milky cataracts. An attack throw is required to touch the target. If the attack throw succeeds, the target is **blinded** until cured.

###### Cure Critical Injury\*

Divine 5 Type: healing

Range: touchDuration: instantaneous

This spell works exactly like *cure light injury*,except that it heals the recipient of 4d6 + caster level damage. The reverse, *cause critical injury*, also works exactly like *cause light injury*, except that it deals 4d6 + caster level extraordinary necrotic damage to the target.

###### Cure Disease\*

Divine 3 Type: healing

Range: touchDuration: instantaneous

This spell cures a living recipient of any and all diseases that it is suffering from, including magical diseases such as lycanthropy and mummy rot as well as fantastical parasites such as slimes. Certain magical diseases might not be countered by this spell or might be countered only by a caster of a certain level or higher. This spell does not prevent reinfection after a new exposure to the same disease.

The reverse of this spell, *cause disease*,can infect a living target with a horrific wasting plague. The target must make a Spells saving throw. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect. If the save fails, the creature is **diseased**. While **diseased**, the creature suffers -2 on attack throws, cannot be magically healed of injuries, and heals at half its normal rate. At the end of each day it is diseased, the creature must make a throw of 2+ or die of the disease. Since sickness comes in many forms, the player or Judge can develop other disease conditions if desired. However, the disease created by this spell is never transmissible.

###### Cure Light Injury\*

Divine 1 Type: healing

Range: touchDuration: instantaneous

This spell can heal a living creature touched by the caster of 1d6+1 damage. The spell can never increase a creature’s hit points beyond their maximum. If the caster so chooses, the spell can cure a **paralyzed** creature of its condition in lieu of healing it of any points of damage.

The reverse form of this spell, *cause light injury*, deals 1d6+1 extraordinary necrotic damage to a living creature touched by the caster. A successful attack throw is required to touch the target.

Undead creatures are affected by this spell and its reverse in opposite fashion; they are injured by *cure light injury* and healed by its reverse.

###### Cure Major Injury\*

Divine 3 Type: healing

Range: touchDuration: instantaneous

This spell works exactly like *cure light injury*,except that it heals the recipient of 2d6 + half caster level damage. The reverse, *cause major injury*, also works exactly like *cause light injury*, except that it deals 2d6 + half caster level extraordinary necrotic damage to the target.

###### Cure Moderate Injury\*

Divine 2 Type: healing

Range: touchDuration: instantaneous

This spell works exactly like *cure light injury*,except that it heals the recipient touched of 2d6 damage. The reverse, *cause moderate injury*, also works exactly like *cause light injury*, except that it deals 2d6 extraordinary necrotic damage to the target.

###### Cure Serious Injury\*

Divine 4 Type: healing

Range: touchDuration: instantaneous

This spell works exactly like *cure light injury*,except that it heals the recipient touched of 2d6 + caster level damage. The reverse, *cause serious injury*, also works exactly like *cause light injury*, except that it deals 2d6 + caster level extraordinary necrotic damage to the target.

###### Curse of the Swine

Arcane 5 , Divine 5 Type: transmogrification

Range: 90’Duration: 1 turn/caster level

This spell can transform one living target per caster level into the form of a boar for the duration of the spell. Each target must make a Spells saving throw. If the save succeeds, the target is not transformed. If the save fails, the target immediately gains the form, physical characteristics, and mental characteristics of boars. However, the transformed target will have the same number of hit points that it previously had in its original form. Otherwise, the transformation is total, including intelligence, behavioral traits, and mentality. Because of the low intelligence of its new form, the target will but dimly remember its former life, and unless persuaded otherwise by, e.g. a character with Beast Friendship or *speak with beasts***,** it will simply engage in swinish behavior for the duration of the spell.

Neither incorporeal nor gaseous creatures can be targeted by this spell, nor can creatures of large size or larger. Creatures with shapechanging abilities such as doppelgangers can revert to their natural forms in one round. Despite its fanciful name, this spell is not actually a curse and can be dispelled by **counterspell** or **dispel magic** like any other spell.

###### Dark Whisper

Arcane 2, Divine 2 Type: death

Range: specialDuration: instantaneous

This spell enables the caster to damage the soul of a living target by whispering terrible words into its ear. A successful attack throw is required to whisper in the creature’s ear unless it is **helpless** or **unconscious**. If the creature is **deaf,** the spell automatically fails. Otherwise, upon hearing the *dark whisper*,the creature must make a Death saving throw. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect. If the save fails, the creature suffers one of the following effects, selected by the caster:

* Plagued by whispers from beyond the grave, the creature suffers a -2 to Listening throws and -2 to surprise rolls.
* Disturbed by truths it cannot unhear, the creature mutters to itself constantly. It cannot sneak or surprise opponents, and its spellcasting initiative rolls are at -1.
* Nightmares wrack the creature. Each time it attempts to rest, it must roll 1d6. On a 1, it tosses and turns all night, cannot recover spells, and does not heal.
* The creature attempts to drown its horror in consumption. It suffers a cumulative -1 penalty to all saving throws every hour until it consumes something (smoke, alcohol, etc.)

With the Judge’s permission, the caster might also invent his own whisper, but it should be no more powerful than those described above. There is no limit to the number of different *whispers*a creature can suffer from. The effects of a *dark whisper*cannot be **dispelled**, but can be removed with a *dispel evil* or *remove curse*spell.

###### Deathless Minion

Arcane 2 , Divine 2 Type: necromancy

Range: 45’Duration: 1 hour

This spell raises the bones or body of a dead target as an undead skeleton or zombie that follows the caster’s spoken commands. An animated skeleton can be created only from a mostly intact skeleton; a zombie can be created only from a mostly intact corpse. Animated skeletons have Hit Dice equal to the Baseline Hit Dice such monsters have in life; for skeletons of humans or demi-humans, this means one Hit Die, regardless of the character level of the deceased. Zombies have one more Hit Die than monsters’ Baseline HD but half the speed.

The caster can give verbal orders to his *deathless minion* when he first animates it and thereafter anytime it is in line of sight on his initiative. Complex or extensive orders require the caster to expend an action in lieu of moving, but simple orders (“protect me!”) do not require an action. Orders can be given in any language the caster speaks. The *deathless minion* will mindlessly obey whatever orders it is given to the best of its (limited) ability. It cannot accomplish tasks that require abstract thought or higher reasoning. If it completes all of its orders, or for whatever reason is physically unable to obey its orders, the *deathless minion* will simply remain stationary until it receives new orders. The*deathless minion* acts on its own initiative each round.

Unlike *animate undead*, the HD of the skeleton or zombie created are not limited by caster level. However, a *deathless minion*lasts for just one hour, after which it crumbles to dust.

###### Death Ward

Divine 4 Type: protection

Range: touchDuration: 2 turns

This spell grants the recipient immunity to any **curse** and **death** spells or effects that target him. The curse effects blocked by this spell include is includes Death spells such as *dismember* or *disintegration*, reversed Healing type such as *extinguish life* or *bestow curse,* and monstrous death effects such as petrifying gaze or enervating touch. However, it does not include other harmful effects that force Death saves, such as poison.

###### Deflect Ordinary Missiles

Arcane 3 , Divine 3 Type: protection

Range: touchDuration: 6 turns

This spell deflects missile attacks dealing mundane damage which are directed at its recipient. Missile attacks include, e.g., arrows, boulders, bolts, bullets, and thrown objects. The deflected missile attacks automatically miss the recipient. If the deflected attack has an area of effect, roll for scatter to determine the direction and distance deflected. The recipient can still be harmed if it ends up in the area of effect after deflection. Attacks made with silver weapons are considered to deal extraordinary damage for purposes of this spell.

###### Deflect Ordinary Weapons

Arcane 5, Divine 5 Type: protection

Range: touchDuration: 3 turns

This spell deflects missile or melee attacks dealing mundane damage which are directed at its recipient. The deflected attacks automatically miss the recipient. If the deflected attack has an area of effect, roll for scatter to determine the direction and distance deflected. The recipient can still be harmed if it ends up in the area of effect after deflection. Attacks made with silver weapons are considered to deal extraordinary damage for purposes of this spell.

###### Delay Death

Divine 5 Type: esoteric, healing

Range: touchDuration: special

This spell extends the time period available to prevent a critically wounded, grievously wounded, or mortally wounded living recipient from dying. A critically wounded creature normally will die unless healed to 1 hp within one day; if *delay death* is cast on the creature, the time is extended to one week. A grievously wounded creature normally will die unless healed to 1 hp within one turn; with *delay**death*, the time is extended to one day. A mortally wounded creature normally will die unless healed to 1 hp within one round; with *delay**death*, the time is extended to one hour. *Delay**death*cannot aid a creature which has been instantly killed, nor does it heal permanent wounds suffered. If cast on a healthy creature (with 1 hp or more), *delay**death*has no effect at all; it cannot “prevent” death.

###### Delay Disease

Divine 1 Type: esoteric, healing

Range: touchDuration: 24 hours

This spell temporarily staves off the ravages of one or more diseases afflicting a living recipient. It will affect acute illnesses such as flu; chronic diseases such as consumption or leprosy; the infection caused by giant rats; the necrosis caused by sage slime and murder maggots; the lycanthropy caused by werecreatures; and even the rotting disease caused by a dragon’s fetid breath.

The spell will temporarily halt the incubation of a disease that has not yet become symptomatic, and ameliorate the symptoms of an existing disease, but it will not reverse any damage already caused by the disease. For example, it would allow a character bedridden by a giant rat’s infection to move and fight normally, and would prevent further loss of attributes to a dragon’s fetid breath for a day, but it would not undo attribute loss already suffered, or restore a finger destroyed by leprosy. Unless the disease is cured, its progress will resume as soon as the spell’s duration ends.

If the spell is cast on a recipient who is unafflicted with any disease(s), it has a prophylactic effect. Should the recipient become afflicted with any disease, the disease’s onset will be delayed until the duration expires.

###### Delay Poison

Divine 2 Type: esoteric, healing

Range: touch Duration: 1 turn/caster level

This spell temporarily staves off the effects of poison in the recipient. Any poison in the recipient’s system or any poison to which it is exposed during the spell’s duration does not affect the recipient until the spell’s duration has expired. Unless cured, saving throws and damage as appropriate are rolled once the spell ends. *Delay poison* does not cure any damage that poison has already done. However, if the spell is cast on a subject who died from poison within the last turn, the target character is restored until the spell duration ends. A revived character will have 1 hp for the duration of the spell, but if the spell ends prior to the poison being cured, the recipient dies again.

###### Desiccate

Arcane 1 Type: blast, elemental (water)

Range: 60’Duration: instantaneous

This spell creates a 5’ diameter sphere of dehydration centered on a target point. Each living creature in the area of effect must make a Blast saving throw. If the save fails, the creature becomes **dehydrated** and suffers 1d12 extraordinary poisonous damage as water departs its body while toxins remain behind. If the save succeeds, the creature suffers half that damage but is not dehydrated.

###### Destroy Dead

Divine 1 Type: death

Range: 225’Duration: instantaneous

This spell can target the bones or body of either an unanimated skeleton or cadaver or an undead skeleton or zombie of less than 9 HD. If the spell targets an unanimated skeleton or cadaver, the skeleton or cadaver automatically crumbles to dust without a saving throw. If the spell targets an undead skeleton or zombie, the target must make a Death saving throw. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect. If the save fails, the target immediately crumbles to dust. The spell has no effect on living creatures or on undead other than skeletons and zombies.

###### Discern Bewitchment\*

Divine 2 Type: detection

Range: 45’Duration: 3 turns (24 hours)

This spell allows the caster to discern whether creatures within range and line of sight are affected by one or more **bewitchments**.If so, the castersees a rosy pink glowemanating from the creature.For purpose of this spell,bewitchmentsinclude **bewitchment**, **domination, enslavement**, and **forgetfulness** effects, as well as the charms of creatures such as harpies or vampires.

The reverse of this spell, *indiscernible bewitchment*, completely masks any and all **bewitchments** on a creature for a period of 24 hours.

###### Discern Curse\*

Divine 3 Type: detection

Range: 45’Duration: 3 turns (24 hours)

This spell allows the caster to discern whether areas, creatures, and objects within range and line of sight are cursed. If so, the caster sees a vivid purpureus glow emanating from the area, creature, or object. The spell does not reveal the nature of the **curse** or how it is triggered, only that an item or area is **cursed**.

The reverse of this spell, *indiscernible curse*, completely masks any and all **curses** on an area (up to 20’ feet on a side), creature, or object, for a period of 24 hours.

###### Discern Evil\*

Divine 1 Type: detection

Range: 45’Duration: 3 turns

This spell allows the caster to discern whether areas, creatures, and objects within range and line of sight are evil. If so, the caster sees a sinister crimson glow emanating from the area, creature, or object. Only the caster sees the glow. Areas are considered evil if they are sinkholes of evil. Creatures are considered evil if they are enchanted creatures (e.g. summoned monsters or undead) of Chaotic alignment or if they have evil intentions towards the caster. Normal characters, even if Chaotic, are not detected by this spell unless they have actively evil intentions against the caster. Objects are considered evil if they are enchanted with or can be used to cast death spells, reversed healing spells, and/or necromancy spells, excluding death spells that exclusively target undead. Other objects might qualify as evil, too (Judge’s discretion). Poisons, physical traps, and natural animals are neither good nor evil, so they are not discerned.

Reversed, this spell becomes *discern good*(sometimes called “discern victim” by its users). The caster sees a bright cobalt glow emanating from the area, creature, or object. Areas are considered good if they are pinnacles of good. Creatures are considered good if they are enchanted creatures of Lawful alignment or if they have good intentions towards the caster. Objects are considered good if they are **blessed** or if they are enchanted with or can be used to cast Lawful divine magic. Certain other objects might also qualify as good (Judge’s discretion).

###### Discern Gist

Arcane 1, Divine 1 Type: detection

Range: 0’ Duration: 2 turns

This spell grants the caster the ability to discern the general meaning of any written script he touches, including ciphers, secret symbols, and other codes. The caster does not receive a detailed and exacting translation of the script, just the central idea or essence of it. For instance, a caster could use this spell to discern that the Kemeshi hieroglyphs on a tomb wall warn of the presence of a powerful mummy lord within, or to discern that a spell scroll written in Kemeshi carries the formula for *unliving puppet*spell, but he could not use the scroll or record the spell in his spellbook without actually learning Kemeshi.

###### Discern Invisible

Arcane 2, Divine 3 Type: detection

Range: 90’Duration: 6 turns

This spell allows the caster to discern invisible creatures or objects within range and line of sight, seeing them as translucent shapes. Only the caster sees the shapes. Characters or creatures who are simply hiding (even if their ability to hide is augmented by magic such as *chameleon*) are not discerned.

###### Discern Magic

Arcane 1, Divine 1 Type: detection

Range: 90’Duration: 2 turns

This spell allows the caster to discern whether areas, creatures, and objects within range and line of sight are imbued with or affected by one or more magical effects. If so, the caster sees a pale glowing yellow light emanating from the area, creature, or object. Only the caster sees the glow. Areas, creatures, or objects imbued with or affected by **bewitchments** (including **control** and **domination** effects), **curses,** or **invisibility** cannot be discerned, however; those require more powerful detection spells.

###### Discern Poison

Divine 1 Type: detection

Range: 90’Duration: 2 turns

This spell allows the caster to discern whether areas, creatures, and objects within range and line of sight are poisonous to him. If so, the caster sees a sickly green glow emanating from the area, creature, or object. Only the caster sees the glow. Note that this spell will not detect poisons to which the caster is immune.

###### Disfigure Body and Soul

Arcane 6 Type: death

Range: 45’Duration: instantaneous

The spell can disfigure the body and soul of a living target. The target must make a Death saving throw. If the save fails, the target must immediately roll on the Savage Mortal Woundstable and the Tampering with Mortality tables for his alignment, and suffer the results listed under Permanent Wounds Suffered and Side Effects Suffered. If the save succeeds, the target must immediately roll on the Mortal Wounds table, but does not have to roll on the Tampering with Mortality table.

When rolling on the Mortal Wound table due to *disfigure**body**and soul*, the only modifiers that apply are those from CON and HD. When rolling on the Tampering with Mortality table due to *disfigure body and soul*, the only modifier that applies is the target’s WIL modifier. The target does not suffer from the results listed in the Condition & Recovery column of either table. Any permanent wounds suffered are instantly cauterized, healed, scarred over, etc.

*Disfigure body and soul*was created by the dread sorcerer-kings of old Zahar to permanently maim the spirit and flesh of those who offended them. What makes this spell truly horrible is that its effects can only be undone by a creature of higher caster level than the caster who disfigured the body and soul. If this spell is cast by a 14th level mage with Black Lore of Zahar proficiency, it is virtually impossible to undo, even with *wish*or *miracle*.

###### Dismember

Arcane 3 , Divine 4 Type: death

Range: 90’Duration: instantaneous

The spell can maim and dismember a living target. The target must make a Death saving throw. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect. If the save fails, the target suffers 3d6 extraordinary necrotic damage and must immediately roll on the Savage Mortal Woundstable and suffer the result listed under Permanent Wounds Suffered. When rolling on the Mortal Wound table due to *dismember*, the only modifiers that apply are those from CON and HD. The target does not suffer from the results listed in the Condition & Recovery column of the table. Any permanent wounds suffered are instantly cauterized, healed, scarred over, etc.

EXAMPLE: Marcus (a fighter with CON 18) is the target of a *dismember*cast by his foe, the sorcerer-king Sebek. Marcus fails his save versus Death, so he takes 3d6 extraordinary necrotic damage and must roll on the Mortal Wounds table. Consulting the Mortal Wounds table, Marcus sees he must roll 1d20 and 1d6. Marcus’s 1d20 roll is a 3, modified by +3 for his CON 18 and +4 for his d8 HD. Marcus cross-indexes a modified d20 roll of 10 against a d6 roll of 3 on the table and finds that one of his arms has been severed!

###### Disintegration

Arcane 6 Type: death

Range: 90’Duration: instantaneous

This spell targets a single creature or object (up to a 10’ x 10’ x 10’ cube of material) with a bolt of annihilating energy that springs from the caster’s pointing finger. (The exact appearance of the bolt can vary based on the caster’s spell signature.)

If the spell targets a creature, the creature must make a Death saving throw. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect. If the save fails, the creature is slain and its remains reduced to a small pile of dust. Any objects carried or worn by the creature are not affected. (The spell could be used to **disintegrate** a creature’s armor or clothing by a caster willing to use death magic to induce nudity, but the casting would not disintegrate the creature.)

If the spell targets an object, the object must make a Death saving throw. If the target object is carried or worn by a creature, use the creature’s saving throw. If the target object is occupied by one or more creatures, use whichever creature’s saving throws are most likely to succeed. If the target object is not carried, worn, or occupied, use the saving throws of 0th level fighters. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect. If the save fails, the object is reduced to nothing but a small pile of dust. If the object was occupied, the occupants fall to the ground, are knocked **prone**, and suffer 1d6 bludgeoning damage per 10’ fallen. If the object was occupied and moving, the occupants are flung 10’ in the direction of movement per 60’ of speed, and suffer 1d6 bludgeoning damage per 10’ moved.

EXAMPLE: Andravus, Castinus, Hyglak, and Raemon are traveling at a speed of 90’ in a heavy chariot in hot pursuit of a powerful warlock. The warlock casts *disintegration* on the chariot. The chariot must make a Death saving throw. Because the chariot is occupied, the saving throw will be made by whichever of the four has the best chance of succeeding. Consulting their character sheets, the players see that Andravus succeeds on 10+, Castinus on 10+, Hyglak on 11+, and Raemon at 7+. Raemon makes the throw, but unfortunately he rolls a 2. The chariot is disintegrated, and all of the adventurers are flung 15’, suffer 1d6 bludgeoning damage, and get knocked prone.

###### Dispel Evil\*

Divine 6 Type: esoteric, protection

Range: 45’Duration: special

This powerful spell can be cast in several different ways, depending on the nature of the evil to be **dispelled:**

* Centered on the caster to create a sacred circle of protection around him. For as long as the caster remains stationary and concentrating, to a maximum of 1 turn, any enchanted creature of Chaotic alignment that starts its initiative in or moves within 45’ of him must make a Death saving throw. If the throw fails, the creature is destroyed. If the throw succeeds, the creature is **frightened** until the end of its next initiative.
* Cast on an evil altar or the center of a place of death within 45’ in order to instantaneously cleanse any sinkholes of evil that have formed there. The Judge will resolve this based on the degree and extent of the evil.
* Cast on a target enchanted creature of Chaotic alignment within 45’ to instantaneously destroy it. The creature must immediately make a Death saving throw with a -2 penalty. If the throw fails, the creature is destroyed. If the throw succeeds, the creature is **frightened** until the end of its next initiative.
* Cast on a target enchanted creature from an elemental sphere of existence within 45’ to banish it. The creature must immediately make a Death saving throw. If the throw fails, the creature is banished back to its sphere. If the throw succeeds, the creature is not affected.
* Cast on a target creature within 45’ who is under the effects of a *necromantic potence*,*spiritwalk*, *soul**eating*, or *soul**swap* to instantaneously dispel the effect(s).
* Cast on a target creature within 45’ in order to instantaneously remove a powerful **curse** that is affecting the creature.

The reverse of this spell, *dispel**good*, is identical in all respects except that it functions against enchanted creatures of Lawful alignment and destroys good altars.

###### Dispel Magic

Arcane 3, Divine 3 Type: protection

Range: 180’Duration: special

This spell can extinguish ongoing spells that have been cast on a creature or object, or extinguish ongoing spells within a cubic area 20’ on a side. The caster must choose whether to cast *dispel**magic* on a creature or object, or to affect an area. If *dispel**magic* is targeted at a creature, all spells and spell-like effects (including ongoing potion effects) might be canceled. If cast upon an area, all such effects within the area might be canceled.

After the caster chooses the spell’s target, he must make an attack throw versus each spell or spell-like effect he might extinguish. Each spell or spell-like effect is considered to have an armor class equal to the difference in caster level between the creator of the spell or effect and the caster. If an attack throw succeeds, that particular spell or spell-like effect is extinguished. If an attack throw fails, the spell or effect continues.

Süreus is a 5th level mage with an attack throw of 9+. If he attempts to dispel an effect cast by a 1st level caster, the effect is treated as AC (1-5) = -4, so he succeeds on 5+. If he attempts to dispel an effect by a 10th level caster, the effect is treated as AC (10-5) = 5, so he succeeds on 14+.

Some spells and effects cannot be ended by *dispel**magic***.** These include *curse*spells or effects, *petrification*spells or effects, and *quest*spells or effects, as well as magic items with effects of permanent duration and diseases caused by spells or effects. *Dispel* *magic* can be used to extinguish spells or effects made permanent by ritual magic, but only if the caster is of higher level than whoever made the effect permanent.

###### Divination

Divine 4 Type: detection, esoteric

Range: selfDuration: special

This spell can provide the caster with a useful piece of advice in reply to a question concerning a specific goal, event, or activity that is to occur within one week. The advice can be as simple as a short phrase, or it might take the form of a cryptic rhyme or omen.

Divinations are not always accurate, however. When the spell is cast, the Judge secretly makes a magic research throw on behalf of the caster. A natural roll of at least 9 always succeeds. If the throw succeeds, the advice is good. If the throw fails, the advice is wrong and harmful.

The *divination* can see into the future only one week, so anything that might happen after that does not affect the result. In addition, if the caster doesn’t immediately act on the advice, the conditions may change so that the advice is no longer useful (Judge’s discretion).

###### Divine Armor

Divine 2 Type: protection

Range: selfDuration: 6 turns

This spell protects the caster with invisible armor of magical force. It guarantees the caster an Armor Class of 7 against melee and missile attacks of all sorts. The *divine armor* stacks with modifiers to AC from DEX but not with modifiers to AC from armor, class powers, conditions, magic, or proficiencies. Conditions which improve an opponent’s attack throw against the creatures they affect (e.g., **flanked** or **vulnerable**) are not affected by *divine armor*. Unlike *arcane armor*, it does not protect against *mage missile*.

###### Divine Grace

Divine 2 Type: protection

Range: touchDuration: 12 turns

This spell grants the recipient a bonus of +2 to all saving throws. The *divine**grace* ends immediately if the recipient acts in ways contrary to the divine caster’s alignment or deity.

###### Divine Protection

Divine 3 Type: protection

Range: touchDuration: 9 turns

This spell protects the recipient with wards and charms of protection and safety. For the duration of the spell, the recipient receives a +2 bonus to AC and +2 bonus to all saving throws. The bonus to AC stacks with both worn armor and any other enhancements to AC.

###### Dominate Beasts

Divine 2 Type: enchantment

Range: 45’Duration: concentration

This spell grants the caster the ability to dominate 1d4 living animal targets. Each target must make a Spells saving throw. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect. If the save fails, the target is **dominated**.

Dominated animals act according to the caster’s will, doing whatever is mentally commanded of them, including fight, flee, growl, fetch etc. However, they have no independent volition and if left without commands simply sit idle. All of the dominated animals act on the caster’s initiative, in any order he chooses.

The spell lasts while the caster maintains concentration, until the target is somehow forced out of range of the caster, or until it is dispelled. The spell can be **dispelled** normally, and can be detected with *discern bewitchment*, but cannot be detected with *discern**magic*. Once the spell ends, the affected animals will be hostile to the caster.

###### Dominate Humanoid

Arcane 2 Type: enchantment

Range: 45’Duration: concentration

This spell grants the caster the ability to dominate a living humanoid target. The target must make a Spells saving throw. If the throw succeeds, the spell has no effect on the creature. If the throw fails, the humanoid is **dominated**.

A dominated humanoid acts according to the caster’s will, doing whatever is mentally commanded of him, including flight, flee, talk, etc. However, it has no independent volition and if left without commands simply stands around aimlessly. It cannot cast spells or use magic items but can use special abilities. The dominated humanoid acts on the caster’s initiative.

The spell lasts while the caster maintains concentration, until the target is somehow forced out of range of the caster, or until it is dispelled. The spell can be dispelled normally, and can be detected with *discern**bewitchment*, but cannot be detected with *discern**magic*. Once the spell ends, the affected humanoids will be hostile to the caster, unless the caster is a priestess of Nasga (described in ***Axioms 11***).

###### Dominate Monster

Arcane 3 , Divine 5 Type: enchantment

Range: 90’Duration: concentration

This spell grants the caster the ability to dominate a living target. The target must make a Spells saving throw. If the throw succeeds, the spell has no effect on that creature. If the throw fails, the creature is **dominated**.

A dominated creature acts according to the caster’s will, doing whatever is mentally commanded of him, including flight, flee, talk, etc. However, it has no independent volition and if left without commands simply stands around aimlessly. It cannot cast spells or use magic items but can use special abilities. The dominated creature acts on the caster’s initiative.

The spell lasts while the caster maintains concentration, until the target is somehow forced out of range of the caster, or until it is dispelled. The spell can be dispelled normally, and can be detected with *discern**bewitchment*, but cannot be detected with *discern**magic*. Once the spell ends, the affected creatures will be hostile to the caster, unless the caster is a priestess of Nasga (described in ***Axioms 11***) and they could potentially be attracted to her.

###### Dominate Plants

Arcane 5 Type: enchantment

Range: 0’Duration: concentration

This spell grants the caster the ability to dominate one or more living plant targets within a 60’ radius of him. Each target, other than ordinary plants, must make a Spells saving throw. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect. If the save fails, or the target is an ordinary plant, the target is **dominated**.

All of the dominated plants act on the caster’s initiative, in any order he chooses. Dominated plants act according to the caster’s will, doing whatever is mentally commanded of them. Since ordinary plants are not normally mobile, the spell grants them the ability to move their branches, leaves, limbs, and vines, though not to uproot themselves.

Assuming the caster commands the plants to hinder non-plant creatures in the area of effect, each non-plant creature that enters, or starts its initiative in, the area must make a Paralysis saving throw. If the save succeeds, the creature avoids being hindered by the plants. If the save fails, the creature is **restrained** until the start of the caster’s initiative. If the save fails on an unmodified 1, the creature is knocked **prone** and **restrained** until it escapes. At the end of each initiative thereafter until it escapes, the creature suffers 1d4 piercing damage and 1d4 toxic damage from nettles, thorns, poison ivy, and the like. The dominated plants have no independent volition and if left without commands simply vegetate.

The spell lasts while the caster maintains concentration or until it is dispelled. The spell can be **dispelled** normally, and can be detected with *discern**bewitchment*, but cannot be detected with *discern**magic*. Once the spell ends, the affected plants will be hostile to the caster (though non-motile ordinary varieties may have difficulty acting on it).

###### Earth’s Excrescence

Arcane 1 Type: blast, elemental (earth)

Range: 90’Duration: instantaneous

This spell causes an area of earth 15’ in diameter centered on a target point to burst like a swollen boil, casting forth chunks of stone, dirt, and hot mud. Each creature within the area of effect must make a Blast saving throw. If the save fails, the creature suffers 1d6 extraordinary seismic damage per caster level (3d6 maximum) and is knocked down. If the save succeeds, the creature suffers half that damage and retains its footing. Creatures of Huge size or greater cannot be knocked down by this spell, but can still suffer damage.

Structures within the area of effect can also be damaged by the *excrescence*. The spell deals up to 1d6 extraordinary seismic structural damage per caster level to wooden structures (max 3d6) and one-fifth that damage to stone structures. (It might deal less if the structure is not entirely in its area of effect.) However, the *earth’s excrescence* can only be brought forth from an area of soil, sand, silt, clay, or uncut, unworked rock. The spell does not function on worked stone, wood, cement, concrete, metal, or magical materials.

###### Earth’s Mire

Arcane 5 Type: elemental (earth), transmogrification

Range: 180’Duration: 3d6 days (perpetual)

This spell changes a volume of natural, uncut, unworked rock into an equal volume of mud. The volume transformed can be up to 3,000 square feet at the surface and up to 10’ deep. Magical stone is not affected by the spell, nor are building, bridges, and other structures made of worked stone.

*Earth’s mire* is most commonly cast in preparation for a pitched battle to create fields of nearly impassable ground. Creatures entering the area of the mud become mired in the deep morass. Mired creatures are slowed to 1/10th their normal movement speed and suffer a -2 penalty to AC.

If the spell is cast underground on a cave’s rock ceiling, the mud immediately falls to the floor and spreads out in a pool, forming a mire (as above). When this occurs, any creature in the affected area must make a Blast saving throw. On a failed save, the creature suffers 8d6 bludgeoning damage. If the save succeeds, the creature suffers half that damage. At the Judge’s discretion, transforming a large volume of ceiling rock in a cave can precipitate a wider cave-in as the area’s structural integrity becomes compromised.

Mud created by this spell remains such until the duration expires or the reverse of this spell (*earth’s**hardening*)restores the rock to its original substance. The volume transformed by the reversed version is identical, but the transmutation is perpetual. When mud becomes rock, the shape of the area may be different, as the mud may have moved or shifted.

###### Earth’s Movement

Arcane 6 Type: elemental (earth), esoteric, movement

Range: 360’Duration: 6 turns

This spell allows the caster to move large volumes, even to the point of altering the surface features of areas within range. By concentrating for one turn, the caster can move a volume of earth (up to 3,000 square feet at the surface and up to 10’ deep) by 60’ towards a point in range. The spell’s range extends upwards into the sky and downwards through the earth until it reaches the limit (360’) or solid rock, and can thus be used to dig pits of up to 240’ depth or build ramparts up to 240’ high. *Earth’s**movement*cannot move stone, only soil.

###### Earth’s Teeth

Arcane 3 Type: blast, elemental (earth)

Range: 180’Duration: instantaneous

This spell can impale one target creature per level of the caster with a pillar of jagged rock that erupts from the earth. All of the targets must be within a single 30’ diameter sphere. The caster can choose which creatures in the area of effect are targeted. The caster must make an attack throw against each target. On a successful attack, the target suffers 5d6 piercing damage. On a failed attack, the target narrowly dodges the impaling pillar. The pillars immediately crumble to dust after the attack.

EXAMPLE: A party of adventurers is set upon by a band of 8 ogres. A fierce melee ensues, into which Quintus, a 6th level mage, casts *earth’s teeth*. Quintus can target 6 creatures, so he selects 6 of the ogres. Quintus must make an attack throw against each ogre (AC 4), As a 6th level mage, Quintus has an attack throw of 9+, so he will need to roll 13 or more to impale each ogre. He will deal 5d6 piercing damage to each ogre he successfully impales.

###### Earth’s Tremor

Arcane 4 Type: blast, elemental (earth)

Range: 0’Duration: concentration

This spell causes the earth near the caster to begin to spasm and shake violently. The caster can choose to have the *tremor*radiate outward from him along the ground in all directions to a 50’ radius, or blast outward along the ground in a flat cone 150’ long and 100’ wide. Each round of the duration, each creature that starts its initiative in or enters the affected area must make a Blast saving throw. Creatures gain a +4 bonus to the saving throw per size category larger than man-sized. If the save fails, the creature suffers 1d6 extraordinary seismic damage and is knocked **prone**. If the save succeeds, the creature suffers no damage and retains its footing. Structures in the area of effect suffer 1 extraordinary seismic structural damage per round per 10’ square area. For example, a 100’ long, 10’ wide in the area of effect would take 100 shp damage per round.

An *earth’s**tremor*can only be brought forth if the caster is standing on soil, sand, silt, clay, or uncut, unworked rock and it is halted by deep water (5’ or more). An *earth’s**tremor* ends when the caster halts or loses concentration.

###### Earth’s Wave

Arcane 2 Type: blast, elemental (earth)

Range: 0’Duration: 1 round

This spell causes the earth to swell into a heaving wave 5’ wide and tall that travels 120’ away from the caster along the ground in any desired direction. Any creature that begins its initiative in, or enters, the wave’s path must make a Blast saving throw. Creatures gain a +4 bonus to the saving throw per size category larger than man-sized. If the save fails, the creature suffers 2d6 extraordinary seismic damage and is knocked **prone**. If the save succeeds, the creature suffers half that damage but retains its footing.

A *wave of earth* can only be brought forth along an area of soil, sand, silt, clay, or uncut, unworked rock. A *wave* cannot be conjured on an area of worked stone, wood, cement, concrete, metal, or water deeper than 5’, and if it encounters such an area, it immediately comes to a halt.

###### Energy Invulnerability

Arcane 4, Divine 4 Type: elemental (any), protection

Range: touchDuration: 1 turn

This spell grants the recipient invulnerability against one type of energy for the duration of the spell. The caster designates the type when the spell is cast, choosing from cold, electric, fire, luminous, necrotic, or seismic. The recipient becomes **immune** to both mundane and extraordinary damage of that type. It automatically succeeds on saving throws against spells or special abilities that deal the chosen damage type, and ignores mundane and extraordinary damage of the chosen damage type.

###### Energy Protection

Arcane 2, Divine 2 Type: elemental (any), protection

Range: touchDuration: 6 turns

This spell grants the recipient protection against one type of energy for the duration of the spell. The caster designates the type when the spell is cast, choosing from cold, electric, fire, luminous, necrotic, or seismic. The recipient becomes **immune** to mundane damage of the chosen type and automatically succeeds on saving throws against spells or effects that deal mundane damage of the chosen type. It becomes **resistant** to extraordinary damage of the chosen type. The recipient reduces the extraordinary damage dealt by the chosen type by half and gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against spells or special abilities that deal extraordinary damage of the chosen type.

###### Enslave Humanoid

Arcane 6 Type: enchantment

Range: 45’Duration: perpetual

This spell can totally **enslave** a living humanoid target to the caster’s will. If the target has fewer than 2 HD, it is automatically **enslaved.** If the target has 2 HD or more, it must make a Spells saving throw. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect. If the save fails, the target is **enslaved** until the effect is dispelled.

When the caster is present, the **enslaved** creature will respond to the caster’s orders and do whatever is commanded of it. If the caster and the **enslaved** creature cannot communicate due to a language barrier or some other situation, the **enslaved** creature will act in the interest of the caster to serve and protect it as best it can. Even if the caster attacks the **enslaved** creature or its friends, it will not defend itself or take arms against the caster.

When the caster is not present, the **enslaved** creature will be confused and passive. It will be capable of carrying out routine activities, but cannot use spells or magic items or make complex decisions. Characters familiar with the **enslaved** creature before its enslavement will be able to tell that something is amiss, although they may not know it is **enslaved** unless they *discern bewitchment*. *Enslave**humanoid*counts as a bewitchment for purposes of *discern**magic*and *discern**bewitchment*.

###### Faithful Companion

Arcane 1, Divine 1 Type: necromancy

Range: touchDuration: 1 hour per caster level

This spell raises the bones or body of a dead canine target as an undead skeleton or zombie under the caster’s mental control. An animated canine skeleton can be created only from a mostly intact skeleton; a canine zombie can be created only from a mostly intact canine corpse. For purposes of this spell, canines include coyotes, dogs, foxes, jackals, and wolves, but not wargs, hellhounds or other monstrosities. Canine skeletons will have Hit Dice equal to the number the canine had in life. Canine zombies will have one more Hit Die than the monster had in life, but one-half the speed.

The caster can give verbal orders to his *faithful**companion* when he first animates it and thereafter anytime it is in line of sight on his initiative. Complex or extensive orders require the caster to expend action in lieu of moving, but simple orders (“protect me!”) do not require an action. Orders can be given in any language the caster speaks. The *faithful**companion* will mindlessly obey whatever orders it is given to the best of its (limited) ability. It cannot accomplish tasks that require abstract thought or higher reasoning. If it completes all of its orders, or for whatever reason is physically unable to obey its orders, the *faithful**companion* will simply remain stationary until it receives new orders. The*faithful**companion* acts on its own initiative each round.

A *faithful**companion*remains animated until destroyed or **dispelled**, or until one hour per caster level elapses. If the *faithful companion* remains intact when the spell ends (e.g. it wasn’t destroyed), the canine’s remains can be re-animated with full hp by another casting of this spell. (Not even death can break the bond between a necromancer and a beloved dog!) However, if the *faithful companion* was destroyed, it crumbles to dust.

###### Fan of Flames

Arcane 1 Type: blast, elemental (fire)

Range: 0’Duration: instantaneous

This spell hurls bolts of searing flame in a fan 40’ long and 20’ wide stretching from the caster’s hands. Each creature of the caster’s choice within the fan must make a Blast saving throw. If the save fails, the creature suffers 1d8 extraordinary fire damage. If the save succeeds, the creature suffers half that damage.

The*fan**of**flames* can also damage structures in its area of effect. It deals 1d8 / 3 extraordinary fire structural damage to wood structures and 1d8 / 10 extraordinary structural fire damage to stone structures. (It might deal less if the structure is not entirely in its area of effect.) It causes combustibles (such as military oil or petards) to ignite.

###### Fate

Divine 5 Type: detection, esoteric

Range: touchDuration: until it happens

This spell grants the caster a prophetic insight into what the future holds for the creature touched. While the exact date and place are not known, a general indication of the creature’s *fate*will be provided. The specific *fate*revealed may be determined by the Judge, or rolled randomly on the table below.

*Fate* is not entirely unalterable; a character can still die from gross stupidity and recklessness, or by willfully avoiding his fate (e.g. suicide). In most cases, however, a character’s *fate*will be fulfilled. A character who has not yet fulfilled his fate gains a +4 bonus when rolling on the Mortal Wounds tables (p. XX). A character who has already fulfilled his fate suffers a -4 penalty when rolling on the Mortal Wounds tables. The Judge is the final arbiter of whether a character has fulfilled his *fate*. Henchmen and hirelings are always reluctant to learn their *fate*, and forcing them to do so counts as a calamity (p. XX). A character cannot have two or more *fates*simultaneously. A character who is slain with an unfulfilled *fate* and later restored to life retains his *fate*. A character who fulfills his *fate*cannot have another *fate*unless he is slain and restored to life.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Roll (1d10)** | **Answer** |
| **1** | You shall set your eyes on the heavens; time enough for the earth in the grave. |
| **2** | You shall be anointed, before you die, as one who walked among the high. |
| **3** | You shall have, in the end, many true vassals, but one false friend. |
| **4** | Your many victories shall be won at the cost of many a woman’s son. |
| **5** | Precious jewels shall buy you only tools and fools. |

| **9** | You shall be remembered for your deeds, or for your greeds. |
| **10** | The world shall lie at your feet until the day of your defeat. |

###### Fiery Pillar

Divine 5 Type: blast, elemental (fire)

Range: 90’Duration: instantaneous

This spell conjures a burning pillar of divine fire 30’ high and 10’ in diameter centered on a target point. Each creature within the pillar must make a Blast saving throw. If the save fails, the creature suffers 6d8 extraordinary luminous fire damage. If the save succeeds, the creature suffers half that damage.

The*fiery pillar* can also damage structures in its area of effect. It deals up to 6d8/3 extraordinary fire structural damage to wood structures and 6d8/10 to stone structures. (It might deal less if the structure is not entirely in its area of effect.) It causes combustibles (such as military oil or petards) to ignite.

###### Fillet and Serve

Arcane 5, Divine 6 Type: death, necromancy

Range: 120’Duration: special

This spell can debone a living target and then animate its extracted skeleton. The target of *fillet and serve*must make a Death saving throw. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect. If the save fails, the target’s own skeleton rips itself out of its body, killing the creature instantly. The extracted skeleton is then animated as an undead creature with Hit Dice equal to the monster’s Baseline HD. (For skeletons of humans or demi-humans, this means one Hit Die, regardless of the character level of the deceased).

The caster can give verbal orders to the skeleton when he first animates it and thereafter anytime it is in line of sight on his initiative. Complex or extensive orders require the caster to expend action in lieu of moving, but simple orders (“protect me!”) do not require an action. Orders can be given in any language the caster speaks. The skeleton will mindlessly obey whatever orders it is given to the best of its (limited) ability. It cannot accomplish tasks that require abstract thought or higher reasoning. If it completes all of its orders, or for whatever reason is physically unable to obey its orders, the skeleton will simply remain stationary until it receives new orders. The skeleton acts on its own initiative each round.

###### Fireball

Arcane 3 Type: blast, elemental (fire)

Range: 360’Duration: instantaneous

This spell creates an explosion of flame that detonates with a low roar into a 20’ diameter sphere centered on a target point. Each creature in the area of effect must make a Blast saving throw. If the save fails, the creature suffers 1d6 points of extraordinary fire damage per caster level. If the save succeeds, the creature suffers half that damage. The explosion creates almost no pressure.

To cast the spell, the caster points his finger in the direction he wants to fire while mentally designating the range (distance and height) at which the *fireball*is to explode. A pea-sized sphere of fire then shoots from the pointing finger and, unless it impacts an interposing barrier before reaching its specified distance, explodes into the *fireball* at the target point. An early impact results in an early detonation. If the caster attempts to send the bead through a narrow passage, such as through an arrow slit, he must make a successful missile attack throw (without range adjustments) to pass through the opening. Otherwise, the spell strikes the barrier and detonates prematurely.

The*fireball* can also damage structures in its area of effect. It deals up to 1d6 extraordinary fire structural damage per caster level to wood structures and one-third that to stone structures. (It might deal less if the structure is not entirely in its area of effect.) It causes combustibles (such as military oil or petards) to ignite. If the damage caused to an interposing structure is enough to shatter or break through it, the *fireball* will continue beyond the barrier in order to attain its full volume.

###### Firestorm

Arcane 5 Type: blast, elemental (fire)

Range: 225’Duration: instantaneous

The caster conjures a storm of burning alchemical naphtha 20’ in diameter centered on a target point. Each creature within the *firestorm* must make a Blast saving throw. If the save fails, the creature suffers 1d6 extraordinary fire damage per caster level and is engulfedin burning naphtha. If the save succeeds, the creature suffers half that damage but is not engulfed.

A creature engulfed in burning naphtha fire suffers an additional 1d8 extraordinary fire damage at the start of its initiative each round. At the end of its initiative, it must make a Blast saving throw. If the save fails, it continues to be engulfed next round. If the save succeeds, the alchemical naphtha sputters out and the creature takes no further damage. The alchemical naphtha cannot be put out by immersion in water, but a *counterspell*can extinguish it on one creature or object and a *dispel**magic*can **dispel** the entire fire.

Like a *fireball*,a *firestorm* can also damage structures in its area of effect. It deals up to 1d6 extraordinary fire structural damage per caster level to wood structures and one-third that to stone structures. (It might deal less if the structure is not entirely in its area of effect.) It causes combustibles (such as military oil or petards) to ignite. Thereafter it deals 1d8 extraordinary fire structural damage to wooden structures and one-third that to stone structures each round until the fire is put out. The structure can save as a 0th level fighter each round.

###### Flay the Slain

Arcane 5 Type: death

Range: 45’ Duration: 1 day

This horrific spell flays the flesh off of one or more eligible corpses in range, then animates the bloody skins as **flay fiends** (see ***Monstrous Manual*** for characteristics). The caster can flay and animate a number of dead corpses up to his caster level each time he casts the spell. A flay fiend can only be created from the corpse of a humanoid with 1 Baseline HD or less with mostly intact skin; burned corpses, decayed corpses older than 2 weeks, and corpses of larger humanoids cannot be used. The flay fiends created by this spell last until destroyed or dispelled, or until one day elapses. The flay fiends thereafter crumble into dust.

###### Flesh to Ash

Arcane 4 , Divine 6 Type: death

Range: 120’Duration: instantaneous

This spell can reduce a living target to ash and dust. The target must be made of flesh and have fewer than 9 HD. The target creature must make a Death saving throw. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect. If the save fails, the creature is slain and its remains reduced to a small pile of dust. Any objects carried or worn by the creature are not affected.

###### Flight

Arcane 3 Type: movement

Range: touchDuration: 1 turn per level

This spell allows the recipient to fly in any direction at a combat speed of 120’ per round and an encounter speed of 360’ per turn. The speed is reduced by encumbrance, however, and the recipient cannot fly carrying more weight than its maximum load. Flying under the effect of this spell requires only as much concentration as walking, so the recipient can attack or cast spells normally. If a *flight*spell is **dispelled** or its duration expires while the recipient is flying, the former recipient of *flight*will plummet from the air.

###### Force of Impetus

Arcane 3 Type: elemental (earth), movement

Range: 90’Duration: instantaneous

This spell flings one or more objects or creatures within range and line of sight a distance of up to 20’. The caster can target one creature or object per caster level. Each object or creature must weigh 2 stone (20 lbs) per caster level or less. Alternatively, the caster can target a single creature or object weighing 2 stone (20 lbs) per caster level squared. Each targeted creature can make a Spells saving throw to resist the effect. If the save succeeds, the spell does not affect the creature. If the save fails, it is affected as above.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Creature / Object’s Weight** | **Damage Dealt** |
| Up to 4 stone (≤40 lbs) | 1d6 |
| 4 stone to 8 stone (41 – 80 lbs) | 2d6 |
| 9 stone to 15 stone (81 – 150 lbs) | 3d6 (5’ radius) |
| 16 stone to 30 stone (151 – 300 lbs) | 4d6 (10’ radius) |
| 31 stone to 60 stone (301 – 600 lbs) | 5d6 (15’ radius) |
| 61 stone to 120 stone (601 – 1,200 lbs) | 6d6 (15’ radius) |
| 121 stone to 240 stone (1,201 – 2,400 lbs) | 8d6 (15’ radius) |
| 241 stone to 392 stone (2,401 – 4,800 lbs) | 10d6 (20’ radius) |

The affected creatures or objects can be flung in any direction the caster chooses. If the caster wishes to fling one or more of the affected creatures or objects into another creature, or onto a specific hard-to-reach location (such as a balcony or pit), he must make a successful attack throw. A throw of a single creature or object may be aimed without penalty, but each additional object or creature imposes a cumulative -1 penalty to the caster’s attack throws. If an aimed throw misses, it scatters like thrown oil.

Creatures or objects flung into walls or other hard surfaces will suffer bludgeoning damage. Creatures or objects will also deal bludgeoning damage to whatever they strike. The amount of damage will be based on the flung creature or object’s weight, as shown on the adjoining table. Large flung objects will also deal damage to an area of effect around their point of impact. Creatures in this area of effect can avoid taking any damage with a successful Blast saving throw, but creatures actually struck by the flung object cannot avoid the damage. Damage from flung objects converts into shp at a rate of 1 shp per 5 points of damage.

EXAMPLE: Quintus, a 9th level mage, is supporting a company of mercenaries during a siege. The mercenaries are suffering from the fire of a light catapult (120 st). Quintus casts *force of impetus*, enabling him to fling up to 9 objects of up to 18 stone each, or a single object of up to (9 x 9 x 2) 162 stone. He opts for the latter, and flings the light catapult onto its own four crew members. He makes a successful attack throw against one of the crew’s AC. That crew member takes 5d6 damage (and dies!). The other three crew members, all within 15’, must make Blast saves or suffer 5d6 damage each. The light catapult itself takes 5d6/5 shp, enough to destroy it.

###### Forest Enchantment

Arcane 5 Type: enchantment

Range: 0’Duration: special

This spell enchants all of the plants in a 240’ radius around the caster. Thereafter the caster, and any allies he “introduces” to the plants as friends, can move among the normal plants in the area of effect free from intentional or accidental harm — rose bushes will twist so that their thorns do not pierce him, poisonous ivy will not leak oil onto him, tree branches and roots will shift slightly so as not to trip him, and so on.

In addition, the enchantedplants will be hostile to enemies of the caster who intrude upon the area; trespassers will find that thorns bite them, branches and roots entangle them, and leaves whistle where they pass. In game terms, the caster and his allies gain a +1 bonus to surprise rolls and improved movement multipliers in the area of effect, while enemies suffer a -1 penalty to surprise rolls and worsened movement multipliers in the area of effect.

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Terrain** | **Allied Move**  **Multiplier** | **Enemy Move**  **Multiplier** |
| Hills, forest, scrubland | x1 | x1/2 |
| Mountain, jungle | x2/3 | x1/3 |

Ordinary plants do not receive a saving throw when the spell is cast. Each season thereafter they receive a saving throw to break the spell, however. The Judge should roll once for all normal plants in the area of effect as if they were a 1 HD monster. If the save fails, the *forest enchantment*remains in effect. If the save succeeds, the spell immediately ends.

If any semi-sapient or sapient plants are within the area of effect when the spell is cast, each such plant must make a Spells saving throw. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect on that plant. If the save fails, that plant is **bewitched**. The effects are identical to *beguile humanoid*, p. XX). Once in effect, the bewitchment lasts until dispelled or until the creature makes a successful Spells saving throw. The plant receives a saving throw to break the spell each day if it has 9 HD or more, every week if it has 5 – 8 HD, and every month if it has fewer than 5 HD.

If the caster ever does severe damage to the plants in the area of effect (such as clear cutting the trees), the *forest enchantment*is immediately **dispelled** and cannot thereafter be cast again on the same plants. However, gathering fallen wood, picking fruit and flowers, trimming leaves, and similar gardening does not end the *forest enchantment*.

Although this spell does not grant the caster any special means of communication with the affected plants*, forest enchantment* is a favorite of elves and wizards who commonly cast it in the vicinity of their fastnesses and towers. Because it relies on an abundance of plant life to have any effect,  *forest enchantment* cannot be cast in barens, desert, grasslands (steppe), hills (rocky), mountains (rocky/snowy), or shrubland (low and sparse).

###### Forgetfulness

Arcane 5 , Divine 5 Type: enchantment

Range: 30’Duration: perpetual

This spell can induce forgetfulness in 2d4 living humanoid targets. If a target has fewer than 2 HD, it is automatically affected by the spell. If a target has 2 HD or more, it must make a Spells saving throw. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect on that target. If the save fails, that target is affected by the spell. Affected creatures lose all memory of the minute (1 round) before the spell was cast and form no memories of anything that happens during the subsequent 10 minutes (1 turn) after the spell was cast.

While under the immediate influence of the spell, the affected creatures are **mesmerized**, as if lost in thought or day dreaming. If attacked, they will defend themselves, but otherwise they will not interfere with the activities of other creatures. When the spell ends, the creatures are not aware of having been affected; they simply feel as if they have come out of a day dream or lapse in attention.

*Forgetfulness* is perpetual. Affected creatures regain memories lost to this spell when the effect is **dispelled** or expires due to the caster’s death or decision not to continue to sustain it. Affected creatures do notrecover memories they never formed, i.e. anything that happened in the subsequent 10 minutes after the spell was cast. *Forgetfulness*counts as a **bewitchment** for purposes of *discern**magic*and *discern**bewitchment*.

###### Frighten Beast

Divine 1 Type: enchantment

Range: 90’Duration: 3 turns

This spell can frighten a living animal target. The target must make a Paralysis saving throw. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect. If the save fails, the target is **frightened** for the duration of the spell, or until the effect is **dispelled** normally or by*remove**fear*.

A **frightened** creature cannot attack, cast spells, or speak (except to scream in stark terror). A **frightened** creature will run from the source of its fear at its full speed for the duration of the spell. If a **frightened** creature cannot flee, it cowers in terror. An **engaged** creature that is **frightened** will cower in terror until it is able to disengage with defensive movement. It suffers a -2 penalty to AC and cannot attack, cast spells, move, or take any other actions until the condition ends.

###### Frighten Humanoid

Arcane 1 Type: enchantment

Range: 90’Duration: 3 turns

This spell can frighten a living humanoid target. The target must make a Paralysis saving throw. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect. If the save fails, the target is **frightened** for the duration of the spell, or until the effect is **dispelled** normallyor by*remove fear*.The effect is identical to that of *frighten beast*, above.

###### Frostbite

Arcane 2 Type: blast, death, elemental (water)

Range: 90’Duration: 1 round per caster level

This spell exposes a target creature to bitter cold. The target must make a Death saving throw. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect. If the save fails, the target immediately suffers 1d6 magical cold damage. At the start of the caster’s initiative for each round of the spell’s duration, the target suffers another 1d6 magical cold damage. At the end of the spell’s duration, the target becomes frostbitten and must roll 1d6 on the 16-20 row of the Mortal Wounds – Savage table (p. XX), possibly losing fingers, toes, an ear, or even his nose. If the spell is dispelled before its duration expires, the target does not become frostbitten.

###### Gale of Wind

Arcane 2 , Divine 4 Type: blast, elemental (air)

Range: 0’Duration: 1 round

This spell creates a strong blast of air that originates from the caster and affects all creatures in a cone 10’ in diameter and 60’ in length. Each creature in the *gale*when the spell is cast, or which enters the gale on its initiative, must make a Blast saving throw. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect on that creature. If the save fails, the effect of the *gale*depends on the size of the creature affected:

* Tiny creatures and objects on the ground are knocked prone and pushed back 1d4 x 10, taking 1d4 points of nonlethal bludgeoning damage. Tiny creatures and objects in the air are pushed back 2d6 x 10’ feet and take 2d6 points of nonlethal bludgeoning damage.
* Small creatures and objects on the ground are knocked prone by the force of the wind. Small creatures or objects in the air are knocked back 1d6x10 feet.
* Man-sized creatures and objects on the ground suffer no effects. Man-sized creatures or objects in the air are pushed back 1d6x5.
* Large or larger creatures or objects suffer no effects.

Missile attack throws within or through a *gale**of**wind* suffer a -4 penalty, as do proficiency throws to hear noise. The force of the *gale*automatically extinguishes any candles, torches, or other unprotected flames. It extinguishes protected flames unless the bearer succeeds on a Paralysis saving throw. A *gale**of**wind*will also do anything that a sudden blast of 50 mph wind would be expected to do, such as fan a large fire, overturn delicate awnings, create a spray of dust, or blow vapors out of range (Judge’s discretion).

###### Gaseous Form

Arcane 3 Type: elemental (air), transmogrification

Range: 90’Duration: 6 turns

This spell can cause a target creature of man-size or smaller to immediately be transformed into a translucent cloud of gas. If the creature is a willing recipient of the spell, it is automatically transformed. If the creature is an unwilling target, it must make a Spells saving throw. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect. If the save fails, the creature is transformed. Once transformed, any objects the creature was carrying or wearing immediately fall to the floor.

While in*gaseous form*, a creature cannot attack, cast spells, speak, or use magic items or equipment. It gains a combat speed of 40’ and an encounter speed of 120’ per turn. The gaseous creature’s movement makes no noise and it can flow below doors and other small spaces that are not sealed airtight. A gaseous creature has an AC of 11 and is immune to mundane damage.

###### Giant Strength

Arcane 4 , Divine 5 Type: transmogrification

Range: touchDuration: 3 turns

This spell imbues the recipient with the strength of a giant. The recipient gains +2 to melee attack throws and deals an additional die of damage with every melee or thrown attack that deals physical damage. If his attack already deals a set of damage dice, it deals an additional set of damage dice with every melee or thrown attack (e.g. 4d6 instead of 2d6) that deals physical damage. The damage dealt becomes extraordinary if it was not already. The recipient also gains a +8 bonus to Dungeonbashing proficiency throws and doubles his normal carrying capacity. The recipient must be man-sized or smaller when this spell is cast or it fails to work.

This spell cannot be combined with any other magical effects that influence strength or size, but it does stack with the recipient’s normal bonus or penalty from Strength — a weak character who is enchanted with this spell has the strength of a weak giant, while a very strong character would gain the strength of a very strong giant!

###### Growth\*

Arcane 3 , Divine 4 Type: transmogrification

Range: touchDuration: 12 turns

This spell **enlarges** a humanoid recipient by one size category. All equipment worn or carried by the recipient is similarly enlarged by the spell, though this change has no effect on the magical properties of any such equipment. Any enlarged item that leaves the recipient’s possession instantly returns to its normal size. The recipient must be man-sized or smaller when this spell is cast or it fails to work.

When **enlarged**,  the recipient becomes two times as tall and eight times as heavy as he is ordinarily. His strength increases proportionately, such that he gains +2 to melee attack throws and deals an additional die of damage with every melee or thrown attack that deals physical damage. If his attack already deals a set of damage dice, it deals an additional set of damage dice with every melee or thrown attack (e.g. 4d6 instead of 2d6) that deals physical damage. The damage dealt becomes extraordinary if it was not already. The recipient also gains a +8 bonus to Dungeonbashing proficiency throws and doubles his normal carrying capacity. (Any equipment he was carrying or wearing now also has twice as much encumbrance.)

The reverse of this spell, *shrinking*, reduces a humanoid recipient and everything he carries by one size category. A **shrunk** recipient becomes half as tall and one-eighth as heavy as he is ordinarily. His strength decreases proportionately, such that he suffers -2 to melee attack throws, deals half damage with physical attacks, and halves his carrying capacity. He also takes a -8 penalty to Dungeonbashing proficiency throws. (Any equipment he was carrying or wearing now have half as much encumbrance.) The effects are not all bad, however; the recipient gains a +4 bonus to Hiding and Sneaking. If unproficient, he is treated as proficient with a throw of 14+.

This spell does not otherwise stack with effects that influence strength or size, but it does stack with the character’s normal bonus or penalty from Strength. If a creature under the effect of a *growth*spell is subject to *shrinking*, or vice versa, both spells are cancelled.

###### Growth, Beast

Divine 3 Type: transmogrification

Range: touchDuration: 12 turns

This spell can enlarge a target animal of large size or smaller. The animal can, but does not have to, make a Spells saving throw to resist. Most animals will choose to make the save, but if the animal is **bewitched** by the caster, has been befriended by the caster using Beast Friendship or *speak with beasts*, or was personally raised and trained by the caster, the animal will trust the caster enough to refuse its saving throw.

If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect. If the save fails or is refused, the target animal is **enlarged**. If an enlarged animal has not previously been enlarged or was not cautioned as to what would occur through, e.g. *speak**with**beasts*, it will become panicked and confused when enlarged. Treat the animal as subject to the effects of *incite**madness* spell until it returns to its original size.

The effects of *beast growth* are otherwise identical to that of *growth*, above. Note that the spell gives no means of command or influence over the enlarged animals.

###### Growth, Plant\*

Arcane 4 , Divine 5 Type: transmogrification

Range: 180’Duration: perpetual

This spell transforms a target patch of ordinary vegetation (grasses, briars, bushes, creepers, thistles, trees, vines, etc.) up to 3,000 square feet in size into a dense overgrown thicket. The thicket is impassable to creatures of man-size or large size. Such creatures can hack their way through the thicket using an axe or short sword at a combat speed of 5’ per round. Small creatures and huge, gigantic, or colossal creatures do not need to hack their way through but move at half normal speed.

The reverse form, *plant**shrinkage*, transforms a target thicket of overgrown and impassable vegetation into a patch of grass and brush that can be easily traversed.

Both *plant**growth* and *plant**shrinkage* are perpetual in duration, lasting until **dispelled** or countered by the reversed spell, or until the caster dies or stops sustaining it. Neither spell has any effect on plant creatures of any sort.

###### Guise Other

Arcane 5 , Divine 6 Type: transmogrification

Range: touchDuration: 1 day

This spell grants the caster the ability to alter a recipient’s shape into that of any other humanoid creature. The caster can control the recipient’s new shape’s physical qualities (such as height, weight, gender, hair color, hair texture, and skin color) within the normal ranges for a creature of its kind. The recipient’ equipment, if any, remains worn or held where possible, and otherwise melds into the new form. If used in conjunction with a successful Disguise proficiency throw by the caster, *guise other*can allow the recipient to appear as a specific individual. The recipient must be man-sized or smaller when this spell is cast or it fails to work.

###### Guise Self

Arcane 4 , Divine 5 Type: transmogrification

Range: self Duration: 1 day

This spell grants the caster the ability to alter his shape into that of any other humanoid creature. The caster can control his new shape’s physical qualities (such as height, weight, gender, hair color, hair texture, and skin color) within the normal ranges for a creature of its kind. His equipment, if any, remains worn or held where possible, and otherwise melds into the new form. If used in conjunction with a successful Disguise proficiency throw, *guise self* can allow the caster to appear as a specific individual. The caster must be man-sized or smaller when this spell is cast or it fails to work.

###### Halt Humanoids

Arcane 2, Divine 2 Type: enchantment

Range: 90’Duration: 1 round/caster level

This spell can render 1d4 living humanoid targets mute and motionless. Each target must make a Paralysis saving throw. If the save succeeds, the target is not affected. If the save fails, the target is **paralyzed** for the duration of the spell or until the effect is **dispelled** or removed by a **cure** spell.

A paralyzed creature is **helpless** and **mute**. A **paralyzed** winged creature cannot flap its wings and falls if in flight at the time. A **paralyzed** swimmer can’t swim and will drown if unable to breathe water.

###### Halt Monsters

Arcane 4 Type: enchantment

Range: 180’Duration: 2d8 turns

This spell can render 1d4 living targets mute and motionless. Each target must make a Paralysis saving throw. If the save succeeds, the target is not affected. If the save fails, the target is paralyzed for the duration of the spell or until the effect is **dispelled** or removed by a **cure** spell. The effect is otherwise identical to *halt humanoid*, above.

###### Healing Circle

Divine 5 Type: healing

Range: 30’Duration: instantaneous

This spell immediately heals one or more living recipients. The *healing circle*can affect one creature per caster level within 30’. Each recipient instantly regains 1d6+1 hit points. The spell can also be used to cure paralysis in one, some, or all of the recipients, but does not then cure any damage in them. The spell will never increase a creature’s hit points beyond the normal amount.

*Healing circle* can be used to treat several unconscious combatants’ wounds simultaneously from a safe distance. However, because it only heals 1d6+1 damage, it only counts as a 1st level spell that grants a +1 bonus on the Mortal Wounds table (p. XX).

###### Hidden Host

Arcane 4 , Divine 6 Type: illusion

Range: 240’Duration: special

This spell conceals a complete military unit of up to 120 man-sized creatures, 60 large (cavalry or ogre-sized) creatures, 20 huge creatures, 5 gigantic creatures, or 1 colossal creature. The creatures of the *hidden**host*appear to be natural effects of the terrain (trees in a forest, stalagmites in a cave, coral reefs in a sea, boulders on a rocky slope, snow drifts on a tundra, shrubs on a moor, etc.). The entirety of the *hidden**host* must be within range of the caster at the time the spell is cast. Only those creatures the caster wishes to hide are affected, and then only if they are willing to be concealed. The caster may include himself among the affected creatures.

The affected creatures are concealed from visual detection by others passing the area for so long as they remain relatively still. An affected creature can sit down or stand up, drink water from a canteen, relieve itself, unsheathe a weapon, or take other actions without revealing itself, but if it ever moves more than 5’ or attacks, the illusion is dispelled for that creature. Casting or concentrating on a spell does not cause an affected creature to be revealed unless the spell affects enemies. Creatures who remain still continue to be hidden. The caster may end the spell early if he wishes by speaking a single word. The illusion is otherwise perpetual, lasting until dispelled or until the caster dies or decides to stop sustaining it. The illusion that conceals the *hidden**host*cannot be disbelieved.

###### Holy Blessing\*

Divine 2 Type: esoteric, protection

Range: selfDuration: 6 turns

This spell fills the caster and up to 30 allied recipients of his choice within 15’ with courage and hope. Each **blessed** recipient gains a bonus of +1 to attack throws, armor class, morale rolls (for monsters or NPCs allied with the caster), and saving throws against magical **fear**. The spell cannot affect creatures who have attacked enemies on their most recent initiative, so it is best cast before a battle begins.

Divine casters of 7th level or higher can use *holy**blessing*to create holy water. One casting of *holy**blessing*will transform 1 pint of ordinary water into holy water. Casting *holy**blessing*in this manner demands a sacrifice to the caster’s deity worth at least 10gp. Once created, holy water will retain its potency indefinitely so long as it is kept in the vial it was blessed in. See the **Equipment Descriptions** in Chapter 4 for information on holy water.

The reverse of *holy**blessing*is called *unholy* *blessing*. It fills the caster and up to 30 allied recipients of his choice within 15’ with fanatical hate and zealotry. Each recipient gains a bonus of +1 to attack throws, armor class, morale rolls (for monsters or NPCs allied with the caster), and saving throws against magical **fear**. *Unholy**blessing*can also be used by chaotic divine casters of 7th level or higher, in conjunction with a sacrifice of at least 10gp, to create a vial of unholy water. Unholy water has beneficial effects when used in the animation of the dead. See *animate**undead*, above.

###### Holy Chant

Divine 2 Type: protection

Range: selfDuration: concentration

This spell is intoned continuously, bringing about supernatural intervention centered on the divine spellcaster and affecting up to 30 allied recipients within a 15’ radius of the caster. The caster, and recipients within 15’ radius of the caster, gain a +2 bonus to saving throws. This effect continues so long as the caster maintains concentration or until dispelled. A *noiselessness* spell that affects the caster also instantly ends the spell.

###### Holy Circle\*

Divine 1 Type: protection

Range: self Duration: concentration

This spell creates a *holy circle* of protection around the caster with a 10’ radius. The circle surrounds the caster for the duration of the spell and provides protection from attacks by enchanted creatures and evil creatures. Enchanted creatures include constructs, incarnations, or undead, or any conjured or summoned creature regardless of type, or any other type of creature designated in the ***Monstrous Manual***as enchanted. Evil creatures include enemy creatures of an alignment other than the caster’s alignment, and inherently evil creatures such as incarnations or undead of Chaotic alignment.

The *holy* *circle* blocks enchanted creatures from entering its area of effect as if it were an impermeable barrier. As a result, the enchanted creatures cannot make attacks on creatures within the circle with their natural weapons. The *holy* *circle’s* barrier to enchanted creatures expires if the caster or any protected creature makes an attack against, casts a spell on, or tries to force the barrier against a blocked creature.

The *holy* *circle* does not block evil creatures from entering its area of effect, but provides some defense against them. All creatures within the radius gain a +1 bonus to AC and a +1 bonus on saving throws against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures.

Creatures can leave and then re-enter, or enter after the spell is cast, and still receive the protection of the *circle*. The *holy* *circle* lasts as long as the caster remains stationary and concentrates on it.

Reversed, this spell becomes *unholy**circle*. Like its counterpart, *unholy**circle*protects the caster from attacks by enemy creatures of an alignment other than the caster’s and blocks enchanted creatures from entering its area of effect. However, instead of protecting the occupants of the *circle* from inherently evil creatures, *unholy**circle*protects them from inherently good creatures (e.g. incarnations of Lawful alignment).

###### Holy Circle, Sustained\*

Divine 3 Type: protection

Range: self Duration: 12 turns

This spell functions exactly as *holy**circle*, but with a duration of 12 turns. The holy circle will move with the caster, who does not need to concentrate to maintain its protection.

Reversed, this spell becomes *unholy**circle,**sustained*, and functions exactly as *unholy**circle*, except with a duration of 12 turns without the need for concentration.

###### Holy Prayer

Divine 3 Type: movement

Range: 90’Duration: 1 round

This spell imbues up to one recipient per caster level with powerful divine energies. On its next initiative, each recipient can move at double its normal speed and can make one additional attack. Spellcasting is not accelerated, nor is the use of magic items such as wands, which may still be used just once per round. Multiple speed effects don’t combine; only apply the most powerful or longest lasting effect.

###### Home Ward

Divine 6 Type: protection

Range: 15’ Duration: indefinite

This spell places a protective *ward* on the structure touched. The structure can be up to 10,000 cubic feet in size. For instance, the spell could protect a 20’ square 25’ tall tower or a 33’ square 9’ tall cottage. (Larger structures can be protected by multiple wards.) Once placed, a *home**ward*remains until either **dispelled** or triggered by an incarnation entering the structure it wards. When the *home**ward* is triggered, the incarnation that triggered it must make a Spells saving throw. If the save fails, the creature is dispelled back to its home plane. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect. In either case, the *home**ward* vanishes. A *home**ward* leaves no visible mark on the structure it protects, but its presence can be revealed by *discern**magic*, *true**seeing***,** or similar spells.

###### Hypnotic Sigil

Arcane 2 Type: enchantment

Range: 90’ Duration: concentration

This spell creates a magical sigil that radiates mesmerizing color and light in a cone 60’ long and 30’ wide. Each living humanoid in the cone that beholds the sigil must make a Paralysis saving throw. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect on that target. If the save fails, the target is **mesmerized**. A mesmerized creature cannot attack, cast spells, move, speak, or take any other action (although it can still defend itself). The *hypnotic sigil*lasts as long as the spellcaster maintains concentration or until **dispelled**.

###### Ice Floe

Arcane 1 Type: elemental (water), wall

Range: touch Duration: 8 hours

This spell instantly freezes a portion of a body of water that the caster touches, creating a flat pack of ice that floats on the remaining water. The *ice**floe*created by the spell may be up to 10’ long and 10’ wide and up to 1’ thick, for a total volume of up to 100 cubic feet. The *ice**floe’s* length, width, and thickness cannot exceed the length, width, and depth of the body of water from which it is created. It cannot be evoked so that it appears where objects or creatures already are. The water inside a living creature cannot be turned into an *ice**floe*, no matter how large the creature is.

As ice is less dense than water, the top of the ice floe will be about 10% higher than the surface of the water. A typical 1’ thick *ice**floe*will stick up about 1.25” above the water. The *ice**floe*can support up to 5 lbs of creatures or objects per cubic foot while remaining afloat, but any additional weight will cause the *ice**floe* to sink below the surface of the water. If the caster concentrates while touching the ice floe, he can magically move it across the water at a combat speed of 20’ per round.

The *ice**floe*is only as resilient as any other large block of frozen water. It counts as a structure with AC 2 and 5 shp. Man-sized creatures, large creatures, and light ballista cannot deal damage to the ice floe. Huge creatures, non-magical fire, and magic can deal 1/5th damage. Artillery, gigantic creatures, and magical fire can deal full damage.

When an *ice**floe* is created in above-freezing temperatures, it will melt after 8 hours. *Counterspell* or *dispel**magic* will instantly melt an *ice**floe*in above-freezing temperatures. Otherwise when the spell expires or **dispelled**, the caster loses the ability to magically move the *ice**floe*, but it does not melt until temperatures rise. (That is to say, the ice doesn’t magically heat up!)

###### Ice Sheet

Arcane 3 Type: elemental (water), wall

Range: 45’ Duration: perpetual

This spell instantly freezes a large volume of water in range, creating a thick sheet of ice that floats on the remaining water. The *ice sheet*created by the spell can be either 1”, 4”, 1’, or 10’ thick.

A 1” thick *ice**sheet*can have a maximum surface area of 180,000 square feet (approximately 240’ radius), a 4” thick sheet can have a maximum surface area of 45,000 square feet (approximately 120’ radius), a 1’ thick sheet can have a maximum surface area of 15,000 square feet (approximately 70’ radius), and a 10’ thick sheet can have a maximum surface area of 1,500 square feet (approximately 20’ radius).

The *ice**sheet’s* surface area and thickness cannot exceed the surface area and depth of the body of water from which it is created. It cannot be evoked so that it appears where objects or creatures already are, but it can be evoked over creatures under the water. The water inside a living creature cannot be turned into an *ice**sheet*, no matter how large the creature is.

As ice is less dense than water, the top of the *ice**sheet* will be about 10% higher than the surface of the water. A 1” thick *ice**sheet*will be about 1/8” above the water, a 4” thick sheet will be about 3/8” above the water, a 1’ thick onewill be about 1.25” above the water, and a 10’ thick one about 1’.

Creatures can safely move across the *ice**sheet* at their encounter speed. Creatures moving across the sheet at their combat speed must make a proficiency throw of 2+ each round or fall prone. Creatures moving across the sheet at their running speed must make a proficiency throw each round with a target value equal to their encumbrance, or fall prone.

The *ice**sheet*can support a maximum weight of 75,000 lbs across its entire surface. Any additional weight will cause the *ice sheet* to sink below the surface of the water. In addition, heavy creatures might break through the ice beneath their feet. A 1” thick sheet can only support small creatures (less than 35 lbs). A 4” thick sheet can support man-sized creatures (up to 400 lbs). A 1’ thick sheet can support large creatures (up to 2,000 lbs). A 10’ thick sheet can support gigantic creatures (up to 32,000 lbs). For each size category by which a creature exceeds the *ice**sheet’s* limit, the ice has a 1 in 6 chance each round of breaking beneath their feet. When this occurs, the creature falls into the water. Creatures in icy water also suffer 1 point of cold damage per round and must make a Swimming throw or begin drowning (see p. XX). If the creature passes the Swimming throw, it may pull itself back onto the safety of the ice on its initiative (although the ice may break again).

EXAMPLE: Quintus is being pursued by an ogre. His escape is blocked by a 500’ wide river. He casts *ice sheet*and creates a 90’ wide, 500’ long, 4” bridge of ice across the river. As a man-sized creature, Quintus is able to safely cross the sheet. The ogre is a large-sized creature, however, and may break through the 4” thick ice. It is one size category larger than the 4” sheet’s limit, so it has a 1 in 6 chance each round of breaking through. Assuming the ogre crosses at its combat speed of 30’ per round, it will require 17 rounds to get across the ice….

The *ice**sheet*is only as resilient as any other large block of frozen water. It counts as a structure with AC 2 and 1 shp per 20 cubic foot area. Man-sized creatures, large creatures, and light ballista cannot deal damage to the ice floe. Huge creatures, non-magical fire, and magic can deal 1/5th damage. Artillery, gigantic creatures, and magical fire can deal full damage.

Once created an *ice**sheet*is perpetual until dispelled. *Counterspell* or *dispel magic* will instantly melt an *ice sheet*in above-freezing temperatures. Otherwise when the spell expires or is **dispelled**, it does not melt until temperatures rise. (That is to say, the ice doesn’t magically heat up!)

###### Ice Storm

Arcane 5 Type: blast, elemental (water)

Range: 360’ Duration: 1 round

This spell conjures a 20’ diameter storm of freezing, razor-sharp hail that rains down from the heavens around a target point. Any creatures or objects that begin their initiative in, or enter, the *ice storm* suffer 1d4 points of extraordinary cold damage per caster level, or half that amount with a successful Blast saving throw. Any movement through the *ice**storm’s* area of effectis at half normal rate.

The*ice**storm* can also damage structures in its area of effect. It deals up to 1d4 extraordinary cold structural damage per caster level to wooden structures and one-third that damage to stone structures. (It might deal less if the structure is not entirely in its area of effect.) Any non-magical fires (burning pitch, campfires, torches, etc.) within the cone are automatically extinguished.

If this spell is cast indoors or underground, the *ice**storm* will strike the ceiling or surface above the desired area of effect. If the damage caused to an interposing structure shatters or breaks through it, the *ice**storm* will continue beyond the barrier in order to attain its full volume.

###### Illumination\*

Arcane 1, Divine 1 Type: esoteric

Range: 180’ Duration: 6 turns + 1 turn/caster level

This spell creates a spherical region of light around the target location or object. The *illumination*approximates that cast by a torch. It sheds bright light out to a 15’ radius and dim light to a 30’ radius. The effect is immobile if cast into an area, but it can be cast on a movable object.

Reversed, *illumination*becomes *tenebrosity*, creating a tenebrous area of darkness. The *tenebrosity*is as dark as a moonless night out to 15’ and as dark as a moonlit night to a 30’ radius. The *tenebrosity* also blocks out **lightless vision** and negates mundane light sources out to 30’.

Sometimes the effects of *illumination*and *tenebrosity*might come into conflict. For instance, an *illuminated*object might be carried into a *tenebrous*area, or a *tenebrosity*spell might be cast in an *illuminated*area. In either case, the level of the respective spellcasters determines the result. If the caster of *illumination* is 3 or more caster levels higher than the caster of *tenebrosity*, then the *tenebrosity* is extinguished. If the caster of *tenebrosity* is 3 or more caster levels higher than the caster of *illumination*, then the *illumination* is extinguished. In any other case, both spells are extinguished, restoring the existing ambient light level.

###### Illumination, Perpetual\*

Arcane 3, Divine 3 Type: esoteric

Range: 480’ Duration: perpetual

This spell creates a spherical region of bright light around a target location or object. The *perpetual**illumination* produces full daylight out to 30’; bright torchlight out to an additional 30’; and dim light out to an additional 30’ beyond that (90’ total). The effect is immobile if cast into an area, but it can be cast on a movable object.

Reversed, *perpetual**illumination*becomes *perpetual**tenebrosity*, creating a tenebrous area of pitch darkness. The *perpetual**tenebrosity*is pitch dark out to 30’, as dark as a moonless night for another 30’, and as dark as a moonlit night for an additional 30’ beyond that (90’ total). The darkness blocks out **lightless vision** and negates mundane light sources out to 90’.

If an *illuminated*objectenters the area of effect of *perpetual**tenebrosity*, or a *tenebrous*object enters the area of effect of *perpetual**illumination*, the lesser spell is immediately extinguished.

Sometimes the effects of *perpetual**illumination*and *perpetual**tenebrosity*may come into conflict. If so, the level of the respective spellcasters determines the result. If the caster of *perpetual**illumination* is 3 or more caster levels higher than the caster of*perpetual**tenebrosity*, then the *perpetual**tenebrosity* is suppressed within the *perpetual*area. If the caster of *perpetual**tenebrosity* is 3 or more caster levels higher, then the *perpetual**illumination* is suppressed within the *illuminated*area. In any other case, both spells are suppressed, restoring the existing ambient light level.

###### Illusory Duplicates

Arcane 2 Type: illusion

Range: self Duration: 6 turns

This spell creates 1d4 *illusory duplicates* of the caster. Once created, the duplicates separate from the caster and cluster around him. Thereafter, the duplicates move through each other as well as the real caster more or less constantly, making it impossible for most creatures to determine which is real. The duplicates mimic the caster’s actions, pretending to cast spells, drink potions, levitate, and so on, just as the caster does. The duplicates always look exactly like the caster at every moment.

Enemies attempting to attack or cast spells upon the caster will always hit a duplicate instead. Any attack against a duplicate destroys it, whether the attack throw is successful or not; likewise, attack spells cast directly upon a duplicate will destroy it, with no saving throw allowed. Area-effect spells are not cast directly on the caster, and thus appear to affect all duplicates exactly as they affect the caster; for instance, if the caster is subjected to a *fireball*, all his duplicates will appear to be injured just as the caster was. Sweep attacks against the caster must target all of the remaining duplicates, treating each as a separate target.

###### Illusory Figment

Arcane 1 Type: illusion

Range: 30’Duration: concentration + 1 round

This spell creates an audiovisual illusion of an area, object, creature, or force, as visualized by the caster, up to a maximum size of 1’ x 1’ x 1’. The illusion does not create smell, texture, or temperature. The caster can move the figment within the limits of the size of the effect. The figment persists so long as the caster maintains concentration.

A creature who encounters an *illusory* *figment* and has reason to be suspicious about its reality can make a Spells saving throw to disbelieve it at the start of its initiative. The creature gains a +4 bonus if the area, object, creature, or force being simulated should have smell, texture, or temperature, provided the creature can tell the figment does not have those qualities. If the save succeeds, the creature confirms the *illusory**figment* is an illusion and can see anything the figment is concealing. If the save fails, the creature continues to believe it is real. The creature cannot attempt to disbelieve the *illusory**figment*again until it has further evidence of its illusory nature (e.g. a friend tells him “it’s an illusion,” he discovers it has no texture where there should be, etc.)

###### Illusory Interior

Arcane 2 Type: illusion

Range: 10’/caster levelDuration: perpetual

This spell creates an illusion of interior decorations and furnishings. The illusion is strictly visual and does not encompass outdoor environments or living creatures. The entirety of the *illusory**interior*must be within range of the spell and fit within a 10’ x 10’ x 10’ cube. (Multiple castings of *illusory**interior* can be used to cover larger areas.) Since the interior décor created by this spell will not smell, sound, or feel as it should, creatures that interact with the *illusory**interior*always receive a Spells saving throw to disbelieve it. If the save succeeds, the creature confirms the interior is an illusion and can see any creatures or objects the *illusory**interior* is concealing. If the save fails, the creature continues to believe it is real. Subject to these limitations, the spell is useful for, e.g., concealing a door with an illusory wall, hiding a pit beneath an illusory carpet, presenting mundane furnishings as luxurious works of art, disguising a pile of coins as a hay pile, and so on. An *illusory**interior* is perpetual, lasting until dispelled or the caster dies or decides to stop sustaining it.

###### Illusory Terrain

Arcane 4 , Divine 6 Type: illusion

Range: specialDuration: special

This spell makes a structure or terrain feature appear as a different type of structure or feature (e.g. field into forest, grassland into desert, hill into a castle, etc.). *Illusory**terrain*requires a full turn to cast, during which time the caster must be in or on the structure or terrain feature to be affected. The structure or feature to be affected must fit within a 480’ diameter sphere. (Multiple castings of *illusory**terrain*can be used to cover larger structures or features.)

Once the spell is cast, the *illusory**terrain* looks, sounds, smells, and feels exactly like the type of feature that the caster has selected. The spell expires immediately if a sapient creature moves into the *illusory**terrain*. (The caster can move out of the terrain after casting the spell without causing it to be expire.) Mindless or bestial creatures do not cause the spell to expire, and instead simply vanish from sight when they enter the *illusory**terrain*.

A creature who encounters *illusory**terrain* and has reason to be suspicious about its reality can make a Spells saving throw to disbelieve it at the start of its initiative. If the save succeeds, the creature confirms the *terrain* is an illusion and can see, hear, smell, touch, and feel anything it is concealing. If the save fails, the creature continues to believe it is real. The creature cannot attempt to disbelieve the *illusory terrain*again until it has further evidence of its illusory nature (e.g. a friend tells him “it’s an illusion,” he sees a deer wander into “the lake” and vanish, etc.)

###### Inaudibility

Arcane 3 , Divine 4 Type: illusion

Range: touchDuration: 1 day

This spell grants the recipient the ability to move and fight noiselessly. It counts as **sneaking** until the effect ends. Should the recipient carry or pick up any items, these items also become noiseless so long as they remain in the creature’s possession. For instance, a bell carried by the recipient would not toll, and a bag of coins would not jingle. Conversely, any items leaving the recipient’s possession regain their normal audibility if fired, dropped or put down. The spell ends if the recipient speaks, suffers damage, fails a saving throw, or casts a spell. Merely attacking or interacting with objects does not end the effect. The spell lasts at most 1 day.

###### Incite Madness

Arcane 3 Type: enchantment

Range: 90’ Duration: perpetual

This spell can afflict a living humanoid creature in range with a terrible madness. The target must make a Spells saving throw. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect. If the save fails, the target becomes**mad**. A mad creature rolls 2d6 on the following table on its initiative number each round to determine its actions:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| 2d6 | Behavior |
| 2–5 | Attack the caster or allies with melee or ranged weapons (or move closer if attack is not possible). |
| 6–8 | Do nothing but babble incoherently. |
| 9–12 | Attack the creature’s own party, if any. |

Attackers are not at any special advantage when attacking the mad creature. A mad creature who is attacked automatically retaliates on its next initiative, as long as it is still mad at the start of its initiative. A mad creature which is restrained, imprisoned, alone, or otherwise can’t carry out the indicated action does nothing but babble incoherently. The duration is perpetual, so the madness lasts until the spell is **dispelled** or extinguished by *remove curse*or until the caster dies or decides to stop sustaining the effect.

###### Indiscernibility

Arcane 4 , Divine 4 Type: esoteric, protection

Range: touchDuration: 1 day

This spell protects the recipient touched from being spied on by any type of *locate*or *scrying*spell. The spell’s magical protection also prevents *locating* or *scrying* on the items the recipient is wearing and on his present location. The caster attempting to *scry* upon the recipient, item, or location will learn it is being magically protected, but will not gain any other information. If the recipient himself can cast *scry*, he still has a chance to notice the attempt, even though he is protected from the spell (see p. XX).

In addition, *indiscernibility* also allows the recipient to automatically refuse a telepathic link froma caster using *telepathy*. The caster attempting to contact the recipient will know the recipient is magically protected.

###### Inferno

Arcane 4 Type: blast, elemental (fire)

Range: 225’Duration: 1 round/caster level

This spell conjures a terrible *inferno* from the Sphere of Elemental Fire itself centered on a target point. The *inferno*is 30’ in diameter and 10’ high and burns everything within. It deals 1d10 extraordinary fire damage each round to creatures that begin their initiative in or enter its area of effect (no saving throw).

The*inferno* can also damage structures in its area of effect. It deals up to 1d10 x 3 extraordinary fire structural damage to wooden structures and 1d10 extraordinary fire structural damage to stone structures on the caster’s initiative number each round. (It might deal less if the structure is not entirely in its area of effect.) The*inferno*causes combustibles (such as military oil or petards) to ignite. The *inferno*lasts until **dispelled** or the spell’s duration expires.

###### Infuriate Beast

Divine 1 Type: enchantment

Range: 360’Duration: 1 turn

This spell can enrage a living animal target with fewer than 9 HD. The target must make a Spells saving throw. If the save fails, the target becomes **infuriated**.

Each round, an infuriated creature will attack any creatures it can detect. It will prioritize attacking whichever creature has most recently damaged it, but otherwise will attack the closest target. If the infuriated creature has no eligible targets, it will wait motionless in seething fury until a target presents itself. An infuriated creature gains a +2 bonus to its attack throws but suffers a -2 penalty to its AC due to its mindless rage. It cannot talk or retreat. It is immune to fear and ignores morale. The creature remains infuriated until the spell ends or the effect is **dispelled** or removed by *remove fear*. However, if an infuriated female creature ever finds itself about to attack its own mate or offspring, the creature may immediately make an additional saving throw at +5, with a successful save ending the effect.

###### Infuriate Humanoid

Arcane 1 Type: enchantment

Range: 360’Duration: 1 turn

This spell can enrage a living humanoid target with fewer than 5 HD. The target must make a Spells saving throw. If the save fails, the target becomes **infuriated**. The effect is identical to that of *infuriate beast*, above.

###### Infuriate Crowd

Arcane 3 Type: enchantment

Range: 360’Duration: 1 turn

This spell can enrage any living humanoid targets with fewer than 5 HD situated within a 20’ diameter sphere centered on a target point. Each target in the sphere must make a Spells saving throw. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect. If the save fails, the target is **infuriated**. The effect is identical to that of *infuriate**beast*, above.

###### Inspire Awe\*

Divine 4 Type: enchantment

Range: self Duration: 3 turns

This spell can inspire awe and dread in the hearts of the wicked. The means by which this occurs will depend on the caster’s spell signature. Each evil creature that begins its initiative or moves within 30’ of the caster must make a Spells saving throw. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect on that creature that round. If the save fails, the creature **falters** that round. A **faltering** creature suffers a -2 penalty to attack throws, proficiency throws, and saving throws against the caster.

For purposes of this spell, evil creatures include hostile creatures of an alignment other than the caster’s alignment, and inherently evil creatures such as undead, or incarnations or enchanted creatures of Chaotic alignment. It can affect incarnations and undead even if these creatures are ordinarily immune to enchantment effects.

The reverse of this spell, *inspire**horror*, can cause fear and terror in the hearts of the kind, targeting good creatures rather than evil. For purposes of this spell, good creatures include hostile creatures of an alignment other than the caster’s alignment, and inherently good creatures such as incarnations or enchanted creatures of Lawful alignment.

###### Invisibility

Arcane 3 , Divine 4 Type: illusion

Range: touchDuration: 1 day

The spell causes the recipient creature or object to become invisible to ordinary sight and even **lightless vision**. An *invisible* creature can still see itself. Otherwise, not even the caster can see the recipient without the aid of *discern**invisible* or *true**seeing*. The recipient can still be heard unless it is *inaudible***,** *noiseless*, or moving silently. An invisible creature counts as **hidden** to all creatures unable to see until the spell ends.

If the recipient of the spell is a creature that is carrying and/or wearing items, the recipient’s carried and/or worn items vanish as well. However, any part of any item that the recipient carries that extends more than 10’ from it is visible. If the recipient drops or sets down invisible items it is carrying, the items immediately become visible. Conversely, if the recipient picks up a visible item and tucks into his clothing or containers, the item becomes invisible. Light never becomes invisible, although a source of light can become so, thus creating the effect of a visible light with no visible source. If the recipient of the spell is dusted with substances such as flour or powder, its dusted form remains visible until the end of its next initiative.

If the recipient casts a spell or attacks a creature, the spell expires at the end of the recipient’s initiative (i.e. after the attack is made or spell is cast). Attacking an unattended stationary object, or cleverly causing a creature harm indirectly, does not cause the spell to expire. The spell lasts at most 1 day.

###### Invulnerability to Evil\*

Divine 3 Type: protection

Range: selfDuration: 1 turn

This spell makes the caster **immune** to mundane damage dealt by evil creatures with melee or missile attacks. Attacks made by evil creatures with silver weapons are considered to deal extraordinary damage for purposes of this spell. Evil creatures include hostile creatures of an alignment other than the caster’s alignment, and inherently evil creatures such as undead, or incarnations or enchanted creatures of Chaotic alignment.

Reversed, this spell becomes *invulnerability to good* and protects the caster from hostile creatures of an alignment other than the caster’s, and from inherently good creatures such as incarnations or enchanted creatures of Lawful alignment.

###### Iron Maiden

Arcane 4 Type: death

Range: 120’Duration: special

This spell creates an invisible crushing vise around the entire body of the target creature. The target must make a Death saving throw. If the save succeeds, the target breaks out of the *iron maiden*; it suffers 1d6 extraordinary bludgeoning damage but the spell ends. If the save fails, the target is imprisoned by the *iron**maiden*. It suffers 1d12 extraordinary bludgeoning damage and is held **helpless** by the spell.

When helpless, a creature cannot attack, cast spells, or move. A helpless creature gains no benefit to its AC from its DEX or shield (if any). A helpless creature can be ambushed or backstabbed by creatures capable of doing so. All attack throws against helpless creatures gain a +2 bonus, or a +4 bonus if the attacker ambushes or backstabs the helpless creature. The helpless creature is dealt the attack’s ordinary damage, or the attack’s ordinary damage multiplied by two or more from ambush or backstab. Melee attack throws against helpless creatures automatically hit if the attacker is of the same or larger size category than the helpless creature. If the attacker is not **engaged**, and his attack is capable of damaging the helpless creature, then the helpless creature may be automatically slain. The attacker cannot cleave thereafter, however. Otherwise, the helpless creature may be dealt the attack’s ordinary damage.

When the caster’s next initiative number comes up, if the caster maintains concentration on the spell, then the imprisoned target must make another saving throw. If the save succeeds, the target breaks out (suffering 1d6 extraordinary bludgeoning damage) and ends the spell. If the save fails, the target continues to be imprisoned (suffering 1d12 extraordinary bludgeoning damage and remaining helpless). The *iron maiden*lasts until dispelled,the caster stops concentrating upon it, or the target dies or makes a successful saving throw and breaks out.

###### Kindle Flame\*

Arcane 1, Divine 1 Type: blast, elemental (fire)

Range: 15’Duration: instantaneous

This spell can cause one or more target objects to burst into flame. The target objects can be wet but must be readily flammable. Readily flammable objects include bits of kindling, sticks of wood, clothing, hair, and cloth, but not flesh. All of the target objects must be within a single 5’ diameter sphere. The caster can select which objects within the spell’s area of effect are ignited. In most cases this spell is used to light campfires in adverse weather, etc.

If the spell is used to set a creature’s clothes or hair on fire, or otherwise to cause harm to a creature, the affected creature must make a Blast saving throw. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect. If the save fails, the creature begins **burning.** Burning creatures suffer 1d8 fire damage at the start of their initiative each round until the flames go out. It takes one full round of rolling on the ground or being immersed in water to extinguish the flames. Unless the object ignited is quite large, the flames burn out naturally in 1d4+1 rounds.

The reverse of this spell, *quench flame*, instantly extinguishes the fire on one or more objects within range. All of the affected objects must be within a single 5’ diameter sphere.

###### Lay of the Land

Arcane 5, Divine 5 Type: detection

Range: 3 milesDuration: concentration

This spell can magically reveal the existence of lairs within 3 miles (i.e. within the area of a 6-mile hex). The Judge should make a Searching proficiency throw on behalf of the caster after three turns (30 minutes) of concentration. The target value for the throw is 4+, or 2+ if the caster has Land Surveying proficiency. If the throw fails, the spell immediately ends. If the throw succeeds, the caster learns the direction and approximate distance to the nearest unrevealed lair and can continue searching with the spell for other lairs. The throw automatically fails if there are no lairs in range, or if all lairs within range have been revealed by the spell. Because the roll is made in secret by the Judge, the caster cannot be certain whether the spell has ended because of chance or because there are no more lairs to find.

###### Leaping

Arcane 1 Type: transmogrification

Range: touchDuration: 3 turns

This spell grants the recipient the ability to leap in great bounds. The recipient can leap 10’ vertically and 30’ horizontally from a standing start. This prodigious jumping ability grants the recipient a +8 bonus on Acrobatics throws. Because of his light step, the recipient needs no rest if engaged in ordinary movement. The recipient must be man-sized or smaller when this spell is cast or it fails to work.

###### Level Water

Arcane 6, Divine 6 Type: elemental (water), esoteric, movement

Range: 360’ Duration: 10 turns

This powerful spell can be cast in several different ways, depending on the caster’s purpose:

* If cast on a target body of water, it reduces the water’s depth by up to 2’ per caster level (to a minimum depth of 1 inch). The water depth is lowered within a more or less square-shaped depression whose sides are up to 10’ long per caster level.
* If cast on a point of deep and open ocean, it creates a whirlpool with a diameter of 10’ per caster level and a depth of 2’ per caster level. See Nautical Hazards (p. XX) for the effects of whirlpools.
* If cast on a water elemental, marid, or other creature from the elemental sphere of water, it functions as a *halt monster* spell.

###### Levitation

Arcane 2 Type: movement

Range: 180’ Duration: 3 turns

This spell allows the caster to move a recipient creature or object of up to a specified weight vertically through the air within range. (If the caster is the recipient, the range is measured from his location when he casts the spell.) The caster can levitate up to 6 stone per caster level. A creature must be willing to be levitated. A levitating creature can carry its normal load (possibly including another creature), but the extra weight counts against the caster’s maximum weight. An object must be unattended or possessed by a willing creature.

In order to move the recipient, the caster must concentrate. The concentrating caster can move the recipient up to 20’ up or down each round on the caster’s initiative. The caster does not need to maintain concentration to sustain the spell. For instance, he can concentrate for one round to move the recipient 20’ up, take another action the following round, and then resume moving the recipient the subsequent round. The caster can change the target of *levitation* on each round that he concentrates, if desired.

The caster cannot move the recipient horizontally. However, if the recipient is a creature, it can still move by, e.g. clambering along the face of a cliff or pushing against a ceiling to move laterally, doing so at half its ordinary speed.

A levitating creature that makes an attack throw is penalized due to its instability, and becomes increasingly unstable as it continues to attack. The first attack throw has a -1 attack penalty, the second a -2 penalty, and so on, to a maximum penalty of -5. If the caster spends a full round concentrating on stabilizing the creature, the penalty is reduced back to -1. (A concentrating caster can thus maintain a levitating archer at a -1 penalty from round to round.) A levitating creature can cast spells or use items or special abilities that do not require an attack throw without any penalty.

If the recipient is up in the air, and either the duration expires, the spell is **dispelled**, the affected creature or object is loaded beyond what the caster can telekinetically support, or the caster begins concentrating on a new target, the recipientwill immediately plummet from the air.

###### Life Transfer

Arcane 5 Type: death

Range: 120’Duration: concentration (1 round/level)

This spell transfers the life force from one living creature in range (the victim) to another living creature in range (the beneficiary). When the spell is cast, the victim must make a Spells saving throw. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect. If the save fails, the life transfer begins. At the end of the caster’s initiative each round, starting on the round he cast the spell, the victim suffers 1d6+1 necrotic damage while the beneficiary is healed an equal amount of damage. The victim can be drained until its hp are reduced to a negative value equal in magnitude to its maximum hp. The life transfer continues until the victim can no longer be drained, the effect is **dispelled**, the caster loses concentration, or one round per caster level elapses.

###### Lightless Vision

Arcane 3 , Divine 4 Type: transmogrification

Range: touchDuration: 1 day

This spell grants the recipient the ability to see as if he were carrying a light source that sheds dim light in a 60’ radius. *Lightless vision* does not enable the recipient to discern colors or to read books, maps, or scrolls, so the recipient might still need a light source for some tasks. The recipient must be man-sized or smaller when this spell is cast or it fails to work.

###### Lightless Vision, Mass

Arcane 5 Type: transmogrification

Range: touchDuration: 1 day

This spell grants the recipient the ability to see as if he were carrying a light source that sheds dim light in a 60’ radius. *Lightless vision* does not enable the recipient to discern colors or to read books, maps, or scrolls, so the recipient might still need a light source for some tasks. The spell can affect one recipient, plus one additional recipient per two caster levels beyond 1st. *Mass lightless vision*will therefore affect five recipients at 9th level, six recipients at 11th level, and seven recipients at 13th level. Each recipient must be man-sized or smaller when this spell is cast or it fails to work on that recipient.

###### Lightning Strike

Arcane 3, Divine 3 Type: blast, elemental (air), esoteric

Range: 480’ Duration: 1 turn / caster level

This spell can only be cast when a thunderstorm is within range. (If one is not present, of course, a high-level caster can summon one using *summon weather*). Once the spell is cast, the caster can thereafter call down one *lightning**strike* per turn (10 minutes). Calling down a *strike* counts as casting a spell, so the caster must remain stationary, take no other action, and avoid being interrupted on the round he calls down the *lightning**strike*. (If the caster gets interrupted, the *lightning strike* does not arrive, but it does not count as his use for that turn; he can try again the next round.)

Once called, the *lightning strike* streaks down from the sky to hit an area 20’ in diameter centered on a target point. Each creature within the area of effect must make a Blast saving throw. If the save fails, the creature take 1d6 extraordinary electric damage per caster level (maximum 8d6). If the save succeeds, the creature takes half that damage.

The*lightning**strike* can also damage structures in its area of effect. It deals up to 1d6 extraordinary electric structural damage per caster level to wooden structures and one-third that damage to stone structures. (It might deal less if the structure is not entirely in its area of effect.)

If the caster calls the lightning strike on a point that is underground or inside structure, the lightning will strike the ceiling or surface above the target point. If the damage caused to an interposing structure shatters or breaks through it, the *lightning**strike*will continue beyond the barrier in order to attain its full volume.

The caster does not have to make a *lightning**strike* every turn but cannot accumulate them, either. *Lighting**strikes* remain available until either the spell duration or the storm ends.

###### Locate Animal or Plant

Divine 1 Type: detection

Range: 180’Duration: 6 turns

This spell reveals the direction and approximate distance to the closest specimen of a particular type of animal or plant within range. The spellcaster must name the specific type of animal or plant he wishes to locate. If no specimens of the desired type of animal or plant are within range, the caster senses nothing. If a specimen comes into range later in the duration of the spell, either because the caster moved or the specimen did, the caster will learn the direction and distance at that time. A *locate**animal or plant* spell is not blocked by earth, stone, or wood, but can be blocked by even a thin sheet of lead or gold (in which case the caster also senses nothing). The spell will locate normal or giant-sized animals, but not intelligent creatures, monstrosities such as owlbeasts or wyverns, or oozes. The animal or plant gets no saving throw. This spell is most often used to find special rare plants; a character using this spell receives a +4 bonus on Naturalism proficiency throws to locate poisonous plants.

###### Locate Distant Object

Arcane 6 Type: detection

Range: 1,200 milesDuration: concentration

This spell allows the caster to sense the direction and approximate distance to a familiar or clearly envisioned object, even over vast ranges (up to 1,200 miles or 50 24-mile hexes). He can search for general items, in which case he senses the direction and distance to the nearest one of its kind. Alternatively the caster can search for a unique item that he has observed firsthand (not through divination). If the item sought is not within range, the casters learns that instead. If the object comes into range later in the duration of the spell, either because the caster moved or the object did, the caster will learn the direction and distance at that time. A *locate**distant object* spell is not blocked by earth, stone, or wood, but can be blocked by even a thin sheet of lead or gold (in which case the caster also senses nothing). Creatures cannot be located with this spell, except indirectly (e.g. a particular item worn by a creature might reveal its location).

###### Locate Haunting

Arcane 5, Divine 5 Type: detection

Range: 12 miles Duration: concentration

This spell allows the caster to sense the direction and approximate distance to the nearest undead creatures within 12 miles (i.e. within the area of a 24-mile hex). The caster can search for undead in general, in which case the spell will reveal the type of, as well as direction and approximate distance to, the nearest undead of any sort. Alternatively, the caster can locate a particular undead creature (e.g. “the mummy Amon-Hotep”) that he either can identify by its true name or has physically encountered in the past. If the creature sought is not within range, the caster senses nothing. If the target comes into range later in the duration of the spell, either because the caster moved or the undead did, the caster will learn the direction and distance at that time. A *locate haunting* spell is not blocked by earth, stone, or wood, but can be blocked by even a thin sheet of lead or gold (in which case the caster also senses nothing).

###### Locate Object

Arcane 2 Type: detection

Range: 180’ Duration: 6 turns

This spell allows the caster to sense the direction and approximate distance to a familiar or clearly envisioned object within range. He can search for general items, in which case he senses the direction and distance to the nearest one of its kind. Alternatively the caster can search for a unique item that he has observed firsthand (not through divination). If the item sought is not within range, the casters senses nothing. If the object comes into range later in the duration of the spell, either because the caster moved or the object did, the caster will learn the direction and distance at that time. A *locate**object* spell is not blocked by earth, stone, or wood, but can be blocked by even a thin sheet of lead or gold (in which case the caster also senses nothing). Creatures cannot be located with this spell, except indirectly (e.g. a particular item worn by a creature might reveal its location).

###### Locate Place of Power

Arcane 6, Divine 6 Type: detection

Range: 12 miles Duration: concentration

This spell allows the caster to sense the direction and approximate distance to the most potent place of power within 12 miles (i.e. within the area of a 24-mile hex). The caster can search for places of power in general, in which case the spell will reveal the type of place it detects as well as direction and distance. Alternatively, he can specify a particular type of place (e.g. “sinkholes of evil”), in which case the spell will reveal the direction and distance to the most potent place of that type. If that type of place of power is not within range, the caster senses nothing. If the place of powers comes into range later in the duration of the spell, the caster will learn the direction and distance at that time. . *Locate**place**of**power* is not blocked by earth, stone, or wood, but can be blocked by even a thin sheet of lead or gold (in which case the caster also senses nothing). *Locate**place**of**power*is a complex spell that requires 1 turn (10 minutes) to cast.

###### Locate Treasure

Arcane 4 Type: detection

Range: 540’Duration: 3 turns

This spell allows the caster to sense the direction and approximate distance to a treasure hoard within 540’. For purposes of this spell, a treasure hoard is a collection of copper, silver, gold, platinum, and gems within a 10’ x 10’ area worth at least 50gp in total. If there are several treasure hoards in range, the caster senses the direction and distance to the most valuable one. If there are no treasure hoards in range, the caster senses nothing. If treasure comes into range later in the duration of the spell, the caster will learn the direction and distance at that time. *Locate treasure* is not blocked by earth, stone, or wood, but can be blocked by even a thin sheet of lead or gold (in which case the caster also senses nothing).

###### Madness of Crowds

Arcane 6 Type: enchantment

Range: 240’ Duration: 1 turn

This spell can drive mad any living humanoid targets with fewer than 5 HD situated within a 60’ diameter sphere centered on a target point. Each target of 2HD or more in the area of effect must make a Spells saving throw. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect. If the save fails, or the target has fewer than 2 HD, the target becomes **mad**. A mad creature rolls 2d6 on the following table on its initiative number each round to determine its actions:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| 2d6 | Behavior |
| 2–5 | Attack the caster or allies with melee or ranged weapons (or move closer if attack is not possible). |
| 6–8 | Do nothing but babble incoherently. |
| 9–12 | Attack the creature’s own party, if any. |

Attackers are not at any special advantage when attacking mad creatures. A mad creature which is attacked automatically retaliates on its next initiative, as long as it is still mad at the start of its initiative. A mad creature which is restrained, imprisoned, alone, or otherwise can’t carry out the indicated action does nothing but babble incoherently. The effects last until the spell expires or until they are **dispelled** or extinguished by *remove curse*.

###### Mage Missile

Arcane 1 Type: blast, elemental (any)

Range: 360’Duration: concentration

This spell enables the caster to fire bolts of arcane energy. On the round this spell is cast, and on each round thereafter that the caster maintains concentration, the caster can fire one *mage missile*at a target. The caster does not have to make an attack throw to hit the target, and the target receives no saving throw. The *mage missile*deals 1d4 extraordinary arcane damage when it strikes.

###### Magic Carpet

Arcane 4 Type: movement

Range: touch Duration: 1 turn/caster level

This spell transforms a target carpet, rug, tapestry, or other woven object into a flying vehicle. The target object must be at least 4’ x 6’ in size, and can be up to 10’ x 15’.

Once enchanted, the *magic carpet*can be steered through the air by the caster on his initiative. Steering the *magic carpet* is easier than riding a horse, and does not require Driving or Riding proficiency. If no passenger is carried, or only one man-sized passenger, the carpet can move with an encounter speed of 300’ per turn. If two or three man-sized passengers are carried, the carpet can move with an encounter speed of 240’ and 180’ per turn, respectively. No more than three man-sized creatures, or a total of 60 stone, can be carried on the *magic carpet*. The *magic carpet* can hover in place at any altitude.

The caster cannot cast spells while the *magic carpet* is moving, but can cast spells if the magic carpet is hovering. Passengers capable of casting spells can do so from the *magic carpet* provided they remain stationary on the carpet. The *magic carpet* is immune to area of effect attacks or spells but creatures on the carpet are affected by them normally. If a creature on the carpet takes bludgeoning or seismic damage, it must make a Paralysis saving throw. If the save fails, the creature falls off the carpet. If the save succeeds, the creature remains stationary on the carpet. If the *magic carpet* is itself the target of an attack, treat it as having an AC of 0 and a number of hit points equal to the caster’s. When the duration expires, or if the magic carpet is ever **dispelled** or destroyed, or starts carrying more than four man-sized creatures or 60 stone, the *magic carpet* will plummet from the air.

###### Magic Lock

Arcane 2 , Divine 2 Type: esoteric, movement

Range: 10’Duration: perpetual

This spell magically locks a target chest, door, gate, portcullis, shutter, window, or other portal. Once cast, the *magic lock* is perpetual. The caster can freely open and close the *magic lock*without affecting the spell, as can any arcane spellcaster 3 or more levels higher than the caster of the *magic lock*.Otherwise, a portal secured with this spell can be opened only by breaking into it or by **dispelling** the *magic lock*.

###### Mirage

Arcane 5 Type: illusion

Range: specialDuration: perpetual

This spell makes a structure or terrain feature appear as another structure or feature (e.g. a tower into a hill, a swamp into a lake, a grove of trees into a stand of minarets, etc.) *Mirage* requires a full turn to cast, during which time the caster must be in or on the structure or terrain feature to be affected. The structure or feature to be affected must fit within a 480’ diameter sphere. (Multiple castings of *mirage*can be used to cover larger structures or features.) Once the spell is cast, the affected structure or terrain looks, sounds, smells, and feels exactly like its illusionary form. The *mirage* is perpetual, lasting until dispelled or until the caster dies or decides to stop sustaining it.Because of its huge area of effect and long duration,*mirage* is frequently used by spellcasters to conceal their sanctums and by elf-lords to hide their fastnesses.

A creature who encounters a *mirage* and has reason to be suspicious about its reality can make a Spells saving throw to disbelieve it at the start of its initiative. If the save succeeds, the creature confirms the *mirage* is an illusion and can see, hear, smell, touch, and feel anything it is concealing. If the save fails, the creature continues to believe it is real. The creature cannot attempt to disbelieve the *mirage*again until it has further evidence of its illusory nature (e.g. a friend tells him “it’s an illusion,” he sees elves walking into hills and vanishing, etc.)

###### Necromantic Invulnerability

Arcane 6 Type: necromancy

Range: selfDuration: 1 hour/caster level

This spell makes the caster preternaturally difficult to kill. Suffused with necromantic energies, the caster could have his lung pierced, his throat cut, his arms cut off, or his skull bashed in, and still not die! In game terms, anytime the caster is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, the caster gets to immediately roll 1d20+1d6 on the Mortal Wounds table. Apply the usual modifiers for Hit points and Constitution, but instead of the modifiers for Treatment and Timing applies his caster level as a bonus. Record the result of any permanent wounds as usual. However, regardless of any permanent wound, the caster is then immediately restored to 1 hp without need for bed rest. A character protected by *necromantic**invulnerability* can only be actually killed if he is slain while helpless by an unengaged combatant, or if he is **disintegrated** or slain by necrotic damage.

EXAMPLE: Ra-Ramses is an 11th level mage with 31 hp and CON 11. He casts *necromantic**invulnerability*on himself. A few hours later, he is caught in a 39 damage *thunderbolt*casts by his rival, Quintus, and reduced to -8 hp. Ra-Ramses immediately rolls 1d20+1d6 on the Mortal Wounds table. His d20 roll is a lowly 2 but his d6 roll is a 5. There is no modifier from his CON of 11. There is a -2 penalty because his hp are at a negative value greater than one quarter but less than half his maximum hp. In lieu of any Treatment or Timing modifiers, he adds a bonus equal to his caster level, or +11. His final d20 result is therefore (2-2+11) or 11. A result of 11, 2 on the Mortal Wounds table means that Ra-Ramses has had an eye damaged. However, he is not critically wounded nor does he need one week’s bed rest; instead he immediately is restored to 1 hp. Quintus watches in horror as Ra-Ramses sits up and brushes himself off, the only apparent effect of the lightning blast being a filmy cataract on one eye.

###### Necromantic Potence

Arcane 2 , Divine 2 Type: necromancy

Range: selfDuration: 1 hour/caster level

This spell imbues the caster with powerful necromantic energies, granting him 1d10 temporary hit points + 1 hp per caster level. These temporary hit points will be the first lost if any damage is suffered, but cannot be regained through rest or healing magic, and will disappear at the expiration of the spell’s duration. While *necromantic**potence*is in effect, the spellcaster is treated as an inherently evil summoned creature for purposes of *discern**evil*and *holy circle*. A successful *counterspell, dispel magic,* or *dispel**evil* spell will strip the caster of his temporary hit points.

###### Neutralize Poison\*

Divine 4 Type: healing

Range: touchDuration: instantaneous

This spell detoxifies any sort of poison in the creature or object touched. If cast upon a creature slain by poison within the last turn (10 minutes), the creature is revived with 1 hit point. If cast upon a poisonous object (such as a weapon, trap, etc.) the poison is rendered permanently ineffective.

Reversed, this spell becomes *poison*. The caster must make an attack throw to touch the target. If the attack succeeds, the target receives a Death saving throw. If the save fails, the target dies. The caster’s touch remains poisonous for 1 round per level of ability, or until discharged (i.e. only one creature can be affected by the reversed spell).

###### Noiselessness

Divine 2 Type: illusion

Range: selfDuration: concentration + 1 round

This spell creates a sphere of complete silence in a 10’ radius around the caster. All sound is stopped: Conversation is impossible, spells cannot be cast, and no noise whatsoever issues from, enters, or passes through the area. All creatures within the radius are **deafened** and **sneaking**. The spell lasts while the caster maintains concentration plus 1 additional round thereafter. The spell immediately ends if the caster speaks.

###### Ogre Strength

Arcane 2 Type: transmogrification

Range: touchDuration: 3 turns

This spell grants the recipient the strength he would possess were he an ogre of equal fitness and musculature. For the duration of the spell, the character gains an additional +2 bonus to melee attack throws and melee damage rolls and an additional +8 bonus on Dungeonbashing throws. In addition, the character gains the ability to strike barehanded for 1d4 bludgeoning damage, and to carry an extra 10 stone at his maximum load. The recipient must be man-sized or smaller when this spell is cast or it fails to work. This spell does not otherwise stack with effects that influence strength or size, but it does stack with the character’s normal bonus or penalty from Strength.

###### Panic

Arcane 6 Type: enchantment

Range: 360’Duration: concentration

This spell produces a 60’ diameter sphere of fear centered on a target point. Each living creature with fewer than 5 HD within the sphere must make a Paralysis saving throw. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect on that creature. If the save fails, the creature becomes **frightened** for as long as the caster maintains stationary concentration, until the affected creatures leaves range of the caster, or until the effect is **dispelled** normallyor by*remove fear*.

A **frightened** creature cannot attack, cast spells, or speak (except to scream in stark terror). A **frightened** creature will run from the source of its fear at its full speed. If a **frightened** creature cannot flee, it cowers in terror. An **engaged** creature that is **frightened** will cower in terror until it is able to disengage with defensive movement. It suffers a -2 penalty to AC and cannot attack, cast spells, move, or take any other actions until the condition ends.

###### Passageway

Arcane 6 Type: esoteric, wall

Range: 30’ Duration: 6 turns

This spell creates a *passageway* through concrete, plaster, stone, or wood walls, but not through walls made of metal or other harder materials. The *passageway* can be up to 10’ wide and up to 30’ deep. The entire *passageway* must be in range of the spell. If the wall’s thickness is more than the depth of the passage created, then a single *passageway* simply makes a niche or short tunnel. Several *passageway* spells can then form a continuing passage to breach very thick walls. When *passageway* ends (due to duration, **dispelling**, or caster’s choice), the passageway instantly closes. Any creatures within the passage are ejected out the nearest exit.

###### Pass Without Trace

Divine 1 Type: transmogrification

Range: touchDuration: 1 turn/caster level

This spell grants the recipient with the ability to magically conceal his tracks while traveling through the wilderness, possibly along with one or more traveling companions. For the duration of the spell, the recipient gains the benefit of the Passing Without Trace proficiency. Use the caster level rather than the recipient’s level to determine how many additional tracks the recipient can conceal. If the recipient already has the Passing Without Trace proficiency, add his class level to the caster level for this purpose. The recipient and his traveling companion’s steps are veritably traceless, with not even mud or snow revealing their tracks. However, a *discern* *magic*or *true seeing*spell cast within three turns of the recipient’s passage will reveal the tracks. The recipient must be man-sized or smaller when this spell is cast or it fails to work.

###### Perpetual Figment

Arcane 6 Type: illusion

Range: 360’Duration: perpetual

This spell creates a perpetual multi-sensory illusion of an area, object, creature, or force, as visualized by the caster, up to a maximum size of 40’ x 40’ x 40’. The illusion includes visual, auditory, olfactory, and thermal components. The illusion can be static (e.g. a wall) or dynamic (e.g. a crackling fire or a dragon circling overhead). If dynamic, the illusion will not be interactive in any way, and the sequence cannot be longer than 1 round per level of the caster. The *perpetual figment’s* sequence will continuously loop. The illusion will last until **dispelled** or until the caster dies or decides to stop sustaining it.

If used to create the illusion of one or more creatures, the illusory creatures have AC 0 and 1 hp; they immediately disappear if hit in combat. If used to simulate an attack spell or an attacking creature, the illusory attack and damage done should be resolved by the Judge as if it were real. However, any creature affected by illusory damage receives a Spells saving throw to disbelieve the illusion. If the save succeeds, the creature takes no damage and realizes the *perpetual**figment* is an illusion. If the save fails, the creature believes it has been damaged, possibly fainting into unconsciousness if it believes its hit points have been reduced to 0 or fewer. However, the illusory damage is not real. A “killed” or “injured” creature realizes it is unharmed at the end of its initiative in 1d6 rounds, and thereafter knows the *permanent**figment*is an illusion.

A creature who encounters a *perpetual**figment* and has reason to be suspicious about its reality can make a Spells saving throw to disbelieve it at the start of its initiative. If the save succeeds, the creature confirms the *perpetual**figment* is an illusion and can see, hear, smell, touch, and feel anything it is concealing. If the save fails, the creature continues to believe it is real. The creature cannot attempt to disbelieve the *perpetual**figment*again until it has further evidence of its illusory nature (e.g. a friend tells him “it’s an illusion,” he notices that the illusion is looping every round, etc.)

###### Petrification\*

Arcane 6 Type: death

Range: 180’Duration: instantaneous

This spell can cause a target living creature, along with all its carried and worn equipment, to turn to stone. The target must make a Paralysis saving throw. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect. If the save fails, the creature is **petrified**. Neither **dispelling** or*remove curse*can undo **petrification**.

Only the reverse spell, *depetrification*, can turn a petrified creature back to living flesh. If the creature’s petrified form was broken or damaged, then when it is depetrified it suffers equivalent damage or deformities. For instance, if while the petrified, the creature’s stone face had eroded away due to a thousand years of rain, then when depetrified the creature would have a horrific melted visage. (The Judge can choose whatever results on the Mortal Wounds tables he deems appropriate to apply to the hapless creature.) Otherwise, the depetrified creature is exactly as it was the moment it was petrified, with no memory of the intervening period. If *depetrification*iscaston stone that is not the result ofa*petrification* spell or effect, it merely transforms a man-sized volume of stone into a gooey pile of organic matter.

###### Phantasmal Figment

Arcane 2 , Divine 3 Type: illusion

Range: 360’Duration: concentration + 1 round

This spell creates the visual illusion of an area, object, creature, or force, as visualized by the caster, up to a maximum size of 20’ x 20’ x 20’. The illusion does not create sound, smell, texture, or temperature. The caster can move the figment within the limits of the size of the effect. The figment persists so long as the caster maintains concentration, plus an additional 1 round after the caster ceases to concentrate, expiring at the end of the caster’s next initiative.

If used to create the illusion of one or more creatures, the illusory creatures have AC 0 and 1 hp; they immediately disappear if hit in combat. If used to simulate an attack spell or an attacking creature, the illusory attack and damage done should be resolved by the Judge as if it were real. However, any creature affected by illusory damage receives a Spells saving throw to disbelieve the illusion (with a bonus for any senses lacking, see below). If the save succeeds, the creature takes no damage and realizes the *phantasmal figment* is an illusion. If the save fails, the creature believes it has been damaged, possibly fainting into unconsciousness if it believes its hit points have been reduced to 0 or fewer. However, the illusory damage is not real. A “killed” or “injured” creature realizes it is unharmed at the end of its next initiative, and thereafter knows the *phantasmal**figment*is an illusion.

A creature who encounters a *phantasmal**figment* and has reason to be suspicious about its reality can make a Spells saving throw to disbelieve it at the start of its initiative. The creature gains a +4 bonus if the area, object, creature, or force being simulated should have sound, smell, texture, or temperature, provided the creature can tell the figment does not have those qualities. If the save succeeds, the creature confirms the *phantasmal**figment* is an illusion and can see anything the figment is concealing. If the save fails, the creature continues to believe it is real. The creature cannot attempt to disbelieve the *phantasmal**figment*again until it has further evidence of its illusory nature (e.g. a friend tells him “it’s an illusion,” he discovers it has no texture where there should be, etc.).

###### Phantasmal Horror

Arcane 5 Type: illusion

Range: 45’Duration: 1 round/caster level

This spell creates an illusion of whatever a target living creature fears most. The spell uses the target’s own nightmares to create the most terrifying beast it can imagine. Only the caster and the target can sense the *phantasmal**horror***,** which “appears” next to the target. On each subsequent round after it appears, the *phantasmal**horror*attacks the target on the caster’s initiative. It has the attack throw of a 4 HD monster. If its attack throw succeeds, the target immediately dies of fright.

Because it exists only as a hallucination in the target’s mind, the *phantasmal**horror*is invulnerable to attacks, cannot be affected by spells (other than to be **dispelled**), and ignores physical laws. It can pursue the target across any distance and through any barriers. Even a caster who teleports to his own sanctum will find the *horror* there waiting for him! The only defense against the *phantasmal**horror*is to flee into an *anti***-***magic**sphere*, to disbelieve the illusion, to **dispel** the illusion, or to avoid being hit for the duration of the spell.

The target of the *phantasmal**horror* can make a Spells saving throw to disbelieve it at the start of its initiative. If the save succeeds, the phantasmal horror vanishes. If the save fails, the target fully believes the *phantasmal**horror* is real (and is almost certainly doomed). The target receives only one chance to disbelieve the *phantasmal**horror*.

###### Phoenix Aura

Divine 6 Type: blast, elemental (fire)

Range: selfDuration: 1 round/caster level or instantaneous

This spell surrounds the caster with an **aura** of elemental fire to a 5’ radius. The caster is not harmed by the *phoenix aura*itself, but any creatures or objects that begin their initiative in or enter the recipient’s **aura** suffer 1d6 points of extraordinary fire damage. The *phoenix**aura*lasts for one round per level of the caster or until the caster triggers an explosion (see below), whichever comes first.

On his initiative, in lieu of moving and attacking, the caster can amplify the *phoenix**aura* into an explosion that affects all creatures within 10’ of the caster (excluding himself). Each affected creature must make a Blast saving throw. If the save fails, the creature suffers 4d6 extraordinary fire damage plus an additional 1d6 extraordinary fire damage per round left in the spell’s duration. If the save succeeds, the creature takes half that damage.

###### Physical Invulnerability

Arcane 4, Divine 4 Type: protection

Range: touchDuration: 1 turn

This spell grants the recipient invulnerability against one type of physical effect for the duration of the spell. The caster designates the type when the spell is cast, choosing from acidic, bludgeoning, piercing, poisonous, or slashing. The recipient becomes **immune** to both mundane and extraordinary damage of that type. It automatically succeeds on saving throws against spells or special abilities that deal the chosen damage type, and ignores mundane and extraordinary damage of the chosen damage type.

###### Physical Protection

Arcane 2, Divine 2 Type: protection

Range: touchDuration: 6 turns

This spell grants the recipient some protection against one type of physical effect for the duration of the spell. The caster designates the type when the spell is cast, choosing from acidic, bludgeoning, piercing, poisonous, or slashing. The recipient becomes **immune** to mundane damage of the chosen type and automatically succeeds on saving throws against spells or effects that deal mundane damage of the chosen type. It becomes **resistant** to extraordinary damage of the chosen type. The recipient reduces the extraordinary damage dealt by the chosen type by half and gain a +2 bonus on saving throws against spells or special abilities that deal extraordinary damage of the chosen type.

###### Predict Weather

Divine 1 Type: detection, esoteric

Range: 1 mile/levelDuration: 24 hours

This spell enables the caster to accurately predict the weather within range of the spell over the period of the next 24 hours. The spell provides no ability to control the weather, merely foreknowledge of what is coming.

###### Prophetic Dream

Divine 6 Type: detection, esoteric

Range: self Duration: special

This spell can provide the caster with a short piece of meaningful and important information. The caster can designate a specific character, settlement, domain, realm, or object about which he would like information, or open himself to whatever the gods find most important. The information will be relayed in the form of a *prophetic dream*the next time the caster sleeps. The information provided by a *prophetic**dream*is always true, but because it comes in the form of a dream it may be misunderstood due to cryptic symbolism and esoteric meaning. If the caster misunderstands the *prophetic**dream***,** or doesn’t act on the information, the conditions may change so that the information is no longer useful. A character can cast this spell no more than once per week.

###### Programmatic Figment

Arcane 6 Type: illusion

Range: 360’ Duration: Special

This spell imbues an area or object with a 40’ x 40’ x 40’ multi-sensory illusion, identical to that created by *spectral**figment*, which will activate when a specific condition occurs. The *programmatic**figment*must be placed upon a particular area or object. The illusion can be static (e.g. a wall) or dynamic (e.g. a crackling fire or a dragon circling overhead). If dynamic, the illusion will not be interactive in any way, and the dynamic sequence cannot be longer than 1 round per level of the caster.

The conditions to trigger the *programmatic**figment* can be as general or as detailed as desired, although only visual and audible triggers can be used. Triggers react to what appears to be the case. Disguises and illusions can fool them. Normal darkness does not defeat a visual trigger, but magical *tenebrosity* or *invisibility* does. Silent movement or magical silence defeats audible triggers. Audible triggers can be keyed to general types of noises or to a specific noise or spoken word. Actions can serve as triggers if they are visible or audible. A *programmatic**figment* cannot distinguish level, Hit Dice, or class except by external garb.

The range limit of a trigger is 10’ per caster level, so a 12th level caster can command a *programmatic**figment* to respond to triggers as far as 120’ away. Regardless of range, the illusion can respond only to visible or audible triggers and actions in line of sight or within hearing distance.

Once it triggers, the *programmatic**figment*will last until **dispelled**, or to a maximum duration of 1 round per level of the caster. Except as noted above, it functions like a *spectral**figment*.

###### Protection from Temperature

Divine 4 Type: protection

Range: touch Duration: 1 turn per caster level

This spell protects one recipient, plus two additional recipients per 5 caster levels past 1st, from all of the effects of either frigid or sweltering temperatures. The temperature protected against is chosen when the spell is cast and applies to all recipients.

###### Purify Food and Water\*

Divine 1 Type: esoteric

Range: 10’ Duration: instantaneous

The spell removes contaminants from spoiled, rotten, poisonous, or otherwise contaminated food and water, making it edible and drinkable. The spell will purify 50 gallons of water or 300 lbs of food – enough for one platoon of 15 cavalry and mounts or one company of 120 infantry to stay fed or hydrated for one day. The purified food and water is still subject to subsequent contamination or spoilage. Unholy water and similar food and drink of significance is spoiled by *purify food and water*, but the spell has no effect on creatures of any type, nor upon magic potions.

Reversed, this spell becomes *putrefy**food**and**water*. It will spoil 50 gallons of water or 300 lbs of food. Anyone consuming putrefied food and water must make a Death saving throw or become **vomiting** for the next 2 hours (12 turns), unable to do anything save retch and heave.

###### Quest

Arcane 6, Divine 6 Type: enchantment, esoteric

Range: 45’ Duration: special

This spell lays a magical injunction on a target creature, assigning it to carry out a course of action specified by the caster – the eponymous *quest*. After hearing the *quest*, the target creature can, but does not have to, make a Spells saving throw to resist it. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect. If the save fails, or the target creature chooses not to make the save, the *quest*is laid upon it. There are a number of reasons why a creature might waive its saving throw against *quest*. For instance, it may be willing to accept the *quest*in exchange for some promised reward; it might be obliged to accept the quest to offer a sacred vow; it might be condemned due to crimes, with the *quest*offering its only chance of redemption; and so on.

A creature cannot be given a *quest* to kill itself or to pursue a course of action that would result in certain (not just likely) death. Apart from those limits, the creature can be given a *quest* to pursue almost any other course of activity, including harming its allies, giving away cherished belongings, confessing its crimes, and so on.

The affected creature is not compelled to pursue the *quest* it has been given, but if it does not do so it will face terrible negative effects (decided by the Judge) for failing to do so. The negative effects will progress from minor penalties on rolls, to loss of class powers and spells, to reduction in attributes, to injury, sickness, and, ultimately, death. If the negative effects become too much to bear and the creature resumes its *quest*,all of the accrued negative effects are removed after one day. However, should the creature later shirk its *quest*again, all of the accrued negative effects will return instantly and progress from there.

If the *quest* was ambiguously worded or vague as to its meaning, the affected creature might be able to subvert the *quest*. For instance, if the creature has been sent on a *quest* to “find and bring to me a mighty magic sword,” it might be able to fulfill its quest by returning to the caster with a copy of the popular fantasy epic “A Mighty Magic Sword.”

If the *quest* requires the affected creature to complete a task that is logically or physically impossible for it to accomplish, the *quest*ends after one day per caster level. For instance, if the creature has been compelled to “find the nine-fingered kobold who slew Athelstan’s parents,” but Athelstan’s parents are alive and well, the *quest*will not last long. However, the creature might undergo significant torment in the interim as negative effects pile up for his failure to pursue the *quest*.

A *quest* (and all effects thereof) can only be ended by a *remove**curse* spell from a caster of higher level than the caster of the *quest* or by a *miracle*or *wish*. **Dispelling** does not affect a *quest*spell. A quest can be detected with *discern bewitchment*,but cannot be detected with *discern magic*.

###### Rain of Vitriol

Arcane 2 Type: blast, elemental (water)

Range: 180’ Duration: 1 round

This spell can only be cast outdoors in Drizzly or Rainy conditions. When the spell is cast, the caster designates a target point and all rain within a 10’ radius of the target point is transformed into vitriol (sulfuric acid). Each creature that begin its initiative in, or enters, the *rain of vitriol*must make a Blast saving throw.

If the save fails, the creature is soaked with vitriol. It suffers 3d4 extraordinary acidic damage immediately, another 2d4 extraordinary acidic damage at the start of its next initiative, and another 1d4 extraordinary acidic damage at the start of its subsequent initiative. If the save succeeds, the creature is merely splashed with vitriol. It suffers 2d4 extraordinary acidic damage immediately and another 1d4 extraordinary acidic damage on the start of its next initiative. If a creature takes an action in lieu of attacking to clean off the vitriol, it can reduce the amount of damage it or any ally suffers on subsequent rounds by 1 die. If a creature completely immerses itself in water (mere rain is not sufficient), it can reduce the damage it suffers on subsequent rounds to 0.

Metal and stone objects suffer minor corrosion from *rain of vitriol*but the effect is merely cosmetic. Constructs or creatures made of metal and stone cannot be affected by the spell.

###### Remove Curse\*

Divine 3 Type: healing

Range: 45’ Duration: instantaneous (perpetual)

This spell can instantaneously remove any or all curses on a recipient creature. The caster must make an attack throw versus each curse. Each curse is considered to have an armor class equal to the difference in caster level between the creator of the curse and the caster of *remove curse*. If an attack throw succeeds, that particular curse is removed. If an attack throw fails, the spell or effect continues. In addition, if the creator of the curse has a higher caster level than the caster, the caster cannot try again to remove the curse until he has gained a level of experience.

*Remove**curse* can be used to extinguish curses made permanent by ritual magic, but only if the caster is of higher level than whoever made the effect permanent. Certain other special curses cannot be countered by this spell at all, or may be countered only by a caster of a certain level or higher.

A recipient who was cursed to retain and use a particular item (such as a **sword -1**) has one turn after this spell is cast to discard and/or destroy the item. If the recipient has not discarded the item by then, the curse returns. The curse on the object is not itself removed and can afflict future possessors.

The reverse of this spell, *bestow**curse*, allows the caster to place a curse on a target creature or unattended object. The target must make a Spells saving throw. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect. If the save fails, or the target was an unattended object, the curse takes effect. The caster can choose one of the following five effects, which will apply to the target creature or to the future possessor of the target object:

* The affected creature’s seed is despoiled. Any children it births or sires are monstrous, or even monsters (Judge’s choice).
* The affected creature’s mind frays and cracks. Immediately upon being cursed, and each day thereafter upon awakening, it must make a Spells saving throw. If the save fails, it goes mad for 1d6 days (as the spell *incite**madness*). If the save succeeds, the creature retains its mind until the next time it rests and awakens.
* The affected creature’s body is afflicted with a wasting disease for which blood is the only cure. It immediately loses 1d3 points of CHA and 1d3 points of CON, and loses an additional 1 point of CHA and 1 point of CON every month thereafter until it dies. However, if the affected creature sacrifices a sapient Lawful victim and consumes its blood, the wasting disease does not worsen that month. A *delay disease* or *cure**disease* spell can prevent the wasting for one day but does not dispel the effect. When the curse is removed, the creature immediately recovers 1d3 lost CHA and CON and regains an additional point each month thereafter until his normal score is restored.
* The affected creature’s natural gifts are taken away from it. Its highest key attribute is halved and it loses one rank of its highest-ranked general proficiency. If it has several eligible attributes or proficiencies, the creature’s favorite is affected (Judge’s call).
* Something wicked takes an interest in the affected creature. A **cacodemon spawn** (as conjured by the spell) begins to interfere in the creature’s day-to-day activities. If the cacodemon spawn is harmed, the affected creature suffers equal damage itself. If the cacodemon spawn is dispelled or destroyed, a new one arrives the following sunset.

The caster may also invent his own curse, but it should be no more powerful than those described above. The **curse** thus bestowed cannot be **dispelled**, but it can be removed with *dispel evil* or *remove**curse* spell. If desired, the spellcaster can dictate a special condition under which the **curse** will automatically be lifted. Returning a stolen treasure to the tomb it was taken from is the most well-known condition; others are left to the caster’s imagination and the Judge’s discretion. The condition must be spoken aloud when the spell is cast, and must be something actually possible without resort to magic. A special condition is not required, but if one is offered it strengths the curse; a curse with a special condition can only be removed by a caster of greater caster level than the original spellcaster. A *divination* or *fate* spell cast upon the affected creature will reveal the specific condition to lift the curse (if any).

There is no limit to the number of different **curses** a character may suffer from. If not removed, the **curse** is perpetual, lasting until the caster dies or decides to stop sustaining it. (However, **curses** inflicted by magic items end with the death of the target rather than the death of the creator of the item. See p. xxx.)

###### Remove Fear\*

Divine 1 Type: esoteric, healing

Range: 180’ Duration: instantaneous (2 turns)

This spell will calm a target creature. It ends the **faltering**, **frightened**, or **infuriated** condition, whether due to magic or mundane causes.

The reverse of this spell, *cause fear*, can cause one target living creature to become **frightened**. The target must make a Paralysis saving throw. If the save succeeds the spell has no effect. If the spell fails, the target is frightened for the duration of the spell, or until the effect is dispelled by **dispelling** or*remove fear*.A frightened creature cannot attack, cast spells, or speak (except to scream in stark terror). A frightened creature will run from the source of its fear at its full speed for the duration of the spell. If a frightened creature cannot flee, it begins **cowering**. An **engaged** creature that is frightened will remain **cowering** until it is able to disengage with defensive movement. A cowering creature is **vulnerable** and and cannot attack, cast spells, move, or take any other actions until the condition ends.

###### Repair Disfigurement and Disability\*

Divine 4 Type: healing

Range: touch (120’)Duration: instantaneous

This spell can heal a character of a single permanent wound, such as a lost limb, disfiguring scar, or shattered spine (see the **Mortal Wounds** rules in Chapter 6 for details on permanent wounds). Despite this spell’s beneficial results, tampering with the body and soul is never without risk. Each time a character benefits from *repair disfigurement**and disability*, he must roll on the **Tampering with Mortality** table in Chapter 6 and apply these results.

The reverse of this spell, *cause**disfigurement**and disability*, can cause a permanent wound in a living creature. The target receives a Death saving throw. If the save fails, the target must immediately roll on the Mortal Woundstable and suffer the result listed under Permanent Wounds Suffered. When rolling on the Mortal Wound table, the only modifier that applies is the target’s CON modifier. The target does not suffer from the results listed in the Condition & Recovery column. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect. Lawful casters can only use *cause**disfigurement and disability*with great justification, such as legally-mandated judicial punishment.

###### Restore Life and Limb\*

Divine 5 Type: healing

Range: touch (120’)Duration: instantaneous

This spell can restore life to a deceased creature (excluding creatures which are not truly alive, such as constructs, elementals, and undead). However, the spell cannot bring back a creature that has died of old age, lost its head, or had its body cremated.

Because it repairs even lethal damage and regrows flesh and bone, this spell also heals a character of any permanent wounds he had at the time of death, such as lost limbs, disfiguring scars, or shattered spines (see the **Mortal Wounds** table in Chapter 6 for details on permanent wounds). Despite this spell’s beneficial results, tampering with the body and soul is never without risk. Each time a character benefits from *restore life and limb*, he must roll on the **Tampering with Mortality** table in Chapter 6 and apply these results.

If *restore**life**and**limb*is ever cast on an undead monster, the monster must save versus Death or be instantly destroyed.

The reverse of this spell, *extinguish**life*, can slay a living creature. The target receives a Death saving throw. If the save fails, the target creature is instantly slain. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect. Lawful casters may only use *extinguish**life*in life-or-death situations against Chaotic foes.

###### Reveal Ritual Magic

Arcane 6 Type: detection

Range: 100 miles/caster levelDuration: 1 day

This spell reveals whether any ritual spells are being cast within its range. If one or more ritual spells are detected, the character will sense the direction and approximate range to the rituals and the spell signature of the rituals’ casters. This spell takes 1 turn to complete, and may be performed but once per week.

###### Righteous Wrath

Divine 2 Type: transmogrification

Range: touch Duration: 1 turn

This spell imbues a recipient with *righteous wrath*towards the enemies of the faith. The caster can affect one recipient initially, one additional recipient at 6th level, and a third at 11th level. The recipients of *righteous**wrath* gain a +2 bonus to attack throws and become immune to fear, but suffer a -2 penalty to AC. The recipients cannot conduct defensive movement to retreat or withdraw from an enemy within 5’ and cannot move in such a way that the range between them and the nearest visible threat would increase. Recipients must advance 5’ after cleaving if necessary to do so to engage an enemy. *Righteous**wrath* lasts until combat ends or until 1 turn elapses, whichever comes first. The recipient must be man-sized or smaller when this spell is cast or it fails to work.

###### Rouse the Fallen

Arcane 5, Divine 5 Type: necromancy

Range: 15’ Duration: 1 hour

This spell animates the bodies of fallen soldiers and sends them back into battle to carry out one more mission after death. The caster declares the mission when he casts the spell. The mission can be as simple as “rise and kill every living creature you encounter except me” to more complex missions such as “rise, form groups of 30, advance in formation at a running rate to Valerian’s Hill, and then defend the hill from any living creatures that attack it.”

On the round he casts the spell, and on each round thereafter that the caster concentrates, the caster can animate one eligible dead target per caster level, transforming each dead target into an undead zombie. To be an eligible target for this spell, a dead creatures must have fewer than 2 HD in life, died in battle within the last day, and left behind a mostly-intact corpse. When animated, the zombies rise with one more Hit Die than the target’s Baseline HD in life. The zombies carry out this mission to the best of their ability for the duration of the spell, ceasing only when **dispelled** or destroyed. The zombies crumble to dust when the spell expires. If dominated or rebuked by a divine caster, the zombies will return to their mission after the effect expires.

###### Rune of Warding

Arcane 3, Divine 3 Type: esoteric, protection

Range: touch Duration: perpetual

This spell creates a magical rune that harms those who enter, pass, or open the target area or object. A *rune**of**warding* can guard a bridge or passage, ward a portal, trap a chest or box, and so on. The maximum area of effect that can be protected by the ward is 25 square feet per caster level. The caster can ward up to 100 square feet each round. It can take multiple rounds for a caster to create a large rune, during which time the caster must maintain stationary concentration. The *rune* can conform to any shape up to the limitations of the total square footage.

After creating the *rune*, the caster must choose to configure it as either a blast rune or spell rune. The caster must maintain stationary concentration for one additional round to configure the rune, and might have to cast a spell.

*Blast Rune:* A blast rune can damage any creatures in the warded area or touching the warded object when it triggers. To create a blast rune, the caster simply specifies a damage type of his choice at the time of casting, choosing from extraordinary cold, extraordinary electric, extraordinary fire, or extraordinary seismic. When the rune is triggered, each creature must make a Blast saving throw. If the save fails, the creature takes 2 extraordinary cold, fire, electric, or seismic damage per caster level. If the save succeeds, the creature takes half that damage.

*Spell Rune:* A spell rune can release a spell stored in the rune when it triggers. To create a spell rune, the caster must cast a blast, death, enchantment, reversed healing, or transmogrification spell of his choice into the rune. When the rune is triggered, the stored spell is cast at caster level. If the spell has an area of effect, the area of effect is centered on the center of the area or object warded. If the spell targets one or more creatures, it targets eligible creatures in order of proximity to the center of the area or object warded. The stored spells effects are resolved according to its description.

After he configures the rune, the caster sets a password. The password must be short enough to say in a few seconds but can be in any language the caster speaks. Thereafter any creature entering or touching the warded area or opening the warded object without speaking the password within one round triggers the rune.

It is easy to accidentally trigger a *rune of warding*, because a completely configured *rune* is nearly invisible. It can be detected as a trap or with spells such as *discern**magic* or *true**seeing*. It can be **dispelled** normally. Alternatively, a character with Trapbreaking proficiency who also has a class power or proficiency enabling him to cast spells, read spell scrolls, or use arcane magic items can safely destroy a *rune**of**warding*with a successful proficiency throw.

A *rune**of**warding*vanishes when triggered. The spell is otherwise perpetual, lasting until dispelled or until the caster dies or decides to stop sustaining it.

**Ashley J. Williams Second Memorial Rule (optional):** If the creature entering or touching the warded area or opening the warded object knows and speaks the password, but cannot speak the language it’s in, he must make an Implements saving throw. If the save succeeds, he successfully speaks the password. If the save fails, he mangles the pronunciation so badly that the *rune*is triggered.

###### Salvific Rain

Divine 6 Type: blast, elemental (water)

Range: 225’Duration: instantaneous

This spell calls down an enchanted rain from the heavens onto a 25’ diameter target area. All fire within the area is instantaneously extinguished. An elemental fire spell with a duration is not **dispelled**, so it might cause further damage in future rounds, but any current fires are put out. Since the *salvific rain*comes from the sky, it cannot extinguish flames that are underground or enclosed within a structure. *Salvific rain*is of great use in naval battles and sieges, when it can save vessels and strongholds from fire.

###### Salving Rest

Divine 1 Type: esoteric, healing

Range: touch Duration: special

This spell allows the recipient to enjoy soothing, peaceful sleep, free of pain and sorrow, whenever he slumbers. As a result of this *salving**rest*, the recipient of the spell will heal an extra 1d3 hit points during each day of complete rest. If the recipient is **enervated**, he gains a +4 bonus on his Death saving throw and can end the condition with two, rather than three, successful saves in a row. The spell ends when the recipient stops completely resting or if he takes any damage.

###### Sanctuary

Divine 1 Type: esoteric, protection

Range: touch Duration: 2 rounds + 1 round/caster level

This spell protects the recipient from aggression. Any enemy attempting to attack the recipient must make a Spells saving throw. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect on that enemy. If the save fails, the enemy cannot attack the recipient. It does not lose its attack and can attack another creature instead. An enemy that is casting a spell, using a special ability, or wielding an item that produces an area of effect does not need to save to be able to include the recipient in the area of effect. If the recipient makes an attack, engages an enemy, or casts a spell that harms enemies, the spell immediately ends. The recipient can decide not to engage opponents in order to avoid ending the spell.

###### Safe Travels

Arcane 4, Divine 5 Type: transmogrification

Range: touch Duration: special

This spell protects a recipient on a journey, guiding him to his destination safe and unhindered. The recipient gains a +2 bonus on proficiency throws to avoid getting lost. In any terrain except clear and grassland terrain, the recipient receives a +3 bonus to proficiency throws to evade wilderness encounters. The duration of the spell extends for the length of the recipient’s journey, to a maximum duration of one month. The recipient must be man-sized or smaller when this spell is cast or it fails to work.

###### Scouring Zephyr

Arcane 4 Type: blast, elemental (air)

Range: 0’ Duration: instantaneous

This spell summons up a *scouring**zephyr* from the skies. Because the spell draws its power from atmospheric winds, it can only be cast outdoors or in a well-ventilated room. The *scouring**zephyr*sweeps from the caster to affect all creatures in a cone 60’ long and 10’ wide at its terminus. Each creature within the cone must make a Blast saving throw. If the save fails, the creature suffer 7d4 extraordinary slashing damage from abrasion and debris whipped up by the *zephyr*and is buffeted by wind (see below). If the save succeeds, the creature suffers half that damage but is not affected by wind. Objects are always affected by the wind unless carried or worn.

Creatures buffeted by wind suffer additional effects, depending on their size:

* Tiny creatures and objects on the ground are knocked prone and pushed back 1d4x10’, taking 1d4 points of nonlethal bludgeoning damage per 10’. Tiny creatures and objects in the air are pushed back 2d6x10’ feet and take 2d6 points of nonlethal bludgeoning damage.
* Small creatures and objects on the ground are knocked prone by the force of the wind. Small creatures or objects in the air are knocked back 1d6x10’ feet.
* Man-sized creatures and objects on the ground suffer no additional effects. Man-sized creatures or objects in the air are pushed back 1d6x5’.
* Large or larger creatures or objects suffer no additional affects.

In addition, the force of the *scouring zephyr*automatically extinguishes any candles, torches, or other unprotected flames. It extinguishes protected flames unless the bearer succeeds on a Paralysis saving throw. A *scouring zephyr*will also do anything that a sudden blast of 50 mph wind would be expected to do, such as fan a large fire, overturn delicate awnings, create a spray of dust, or blow vapors out of range (Judge’s discretion).

###### Scry

Arcane 4, Divine 5 Type: detection, esoteric

Range: special Duration: 1 turn

This spell enables the spellcaster to see moving images of a target creature, object, or place of his choice, regardless of any intervening distance. The spellcaster must have access to a mirror, crystal, reflective pool, or other surface upon which the images can be displayed. The more familiar the caster is with the creature, object or place viewed, the clearer the images will be. The larger the area of the place viewed, the more clouded the images will be. If the target is inside an *anti***-***magic**sphere* or protected by *indiscernibility*, the images will be entirely opaque, revealing nothing.

The apparent point of view displayed depends on the size of the target: It will always be just far enough away from the target that its entire body (if a creature), surface area (if an object), or vicinity (if a place) is seen. The Judge chooses the exact angle and point. For instance, if the caster scries a castle, the Judge might decide he sees an image of the castle as if from a hill overlooking its entirety. If the caster scries a lord in that castle, the Judge might decide he sees an image of the lord as if from a courtier in the throne room.

If the caster chooses, he can cast either*clairaudiency*or *telepathy*at the same time that he casts *scry*in order to use one of those spells while scrying. If so, the range of that spell is measured from the apparent point of view from which the caster is scrying. The spellcaster is otherwise unable to cast spells at or communicate with what he views.

Anytime a creature capable of casting *scry* (due to its repertoire or a spell-like ability or current use of a magic item) is the target of *scry*, is in the target place, or is carrying or wearing the target object, the creature has a chance of learning he is being spied on. The Judge must make a secret Spells saving throw on behalf of the creature. If the save fails, the creature learns nothing. If the saving throw succeeds, the creature knows he is being scried upon and learns the spell signature of the caster doing so. If the scried creature itself casts *scry*while the original caster is still maintaining concentration, the scried creature can then scry on the caster with the same clarity that the caster is seeing with. (And yes, the original caster now gets a Spells saving throw to detect that he is now being scried on!) If the scried creature casts *counterspell*or *dispel**magic*, the *scry*spell is considered an eligible target to be **dispelled**.

The caster can scry on his target for up to 1 turn, but must maintain stationary concentration throughout. If the caster stops concentrating for any reason, the images vanish and the spell expires.

###### Seal Portal

Arcane 1, Divine 1 Type: esoteric, movement

Range: 10’ Duration: 2d6 turns

This spell magically seals a chest, door, gate, portcullis, shutter, or window. The spell closes the portal as if it were securely fastened and locked, though the portal cannot be picked. A *seal**portal* lasts until it is **dispelled** or its duration expires or until the portal is physically destroyed.

###### Selective Fire

Arcane 5 Type: blast, elemental (fire)

Range: 0’ Duration: instantaneous

This spell creates a 60’ long x 30’ diameter cone of fiery bolts that sprays from the caster’s outstretched fingers to strike a selection of targets. The caster can designate any, some, or all of the creatures in the cone as targets. Each target must make a Blast saving throw. If the save fails, the target suffers 3d6 extraordinary fire damage. If the save succeeds, the target suffers half that damage.

The*selective**fire* can also target any, some, or all of the structures in the cone. Each targeted structure takes up to 3d6 extraordinary fire structural damage if wood, or one-fifth that if stone. (It might deal less if the structure is not entirely in its area of effect.) It can set any, some, or all of the combustible materials in the cone aflame.

###### Sharpness

Arcane 1 Type: transmogrification

Range: touch Duration: 3 turns

This spell temporarily enhances one or more edged or pointed weapons to the equivalent of a **magic weapon +1**. The bonus does not stack with masterwork weapon bonuses, but magic weapons gain an additional +1 to damage. A single casting will affect 20 arrows, 2 tiny one-handed weapons, or one small, medium, or large weapon.

###### Shatter Blade

Arcane 1, Divine 1 Type: blast, elemental (earth)

Range: 45’ Duration: instantaneous

This spell can destroy a weapon, causing its blade to shatter or melt away into smoke. If the weapon is an ordinary item that is not being held by a creature, the weapon is automatically shattered. If the weapon is held by a creature, the wielder must make a Death saving throw, adding the weapon’s magic bonus (if any) to the save. If the weapon is a magic item that is not being held by a creature, the weapon must make a Death saving throw as a fighter of a level equal to its magic bonus. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect. If the save fails, the weapon is shattered. The spell causes no harm to the creature holding the weapon (except for depriving him of it).

A caster of 6th level or higher can shatter two weapons, while a caster of 11th level of higher can shatter three weapons. The weapons may be held by the same creature or by different creatures within range. Each creature or weapon saves separately in any case.

###### Shrieking Skull

Arcane 4 Type: esoteric, necromancy

Range: 45’ Duration: 1 turn

This spell allows the caster to animate the skull of a single human or humanoid. The *shrieking**skull* acts according to the caster’s will, doing whatever is mentally commanded of it.

The caster can give verbal orders to the *shrieking**skull*when he first animates it and thereafter anytime it is in line of sight on his initiative. Complex or extensive orders require the caster to expend action in lieu of moving, but simple orders (“protect me!”) do not require an action. Orders can be given in any language the caster speaks. The *shrieking**skull*will mindlessly obey whatever orders it is given to the best of its (limited) ability. It cannot accomplish tasks that require abstract thought or higher reasoning. If it completes all of its orders, or for whatever reason is physically unable to obey its orders, the *shrieking**skull* will simply remain stationary until it receives new orders. The *shrieking**skull* acts on its own initiative each round.

The skull has 4+4 Hit Dice and an AC of 9. It can fly with a combat speed of 60’. It can attack with a bite or a fearful shriek. The bite deals 1d6 piercing damage and can induce fear in the bitten creature. The fearful shriek can affect all living creatures within 10’ of the shrieking skull. A living creature bitten by the skull or within the area of effect of its piercing shriek must make a Paralysis saving throw. If the save fails, the creature becomes **frightened** for 2 turns. If the save succeeds, the creature is not affected by the fear. When the shriek is used, or at the end of the spell’s duration (whichever comes first), the skull crumbles to the floor. The skull cannot be rebuked.

Shrieking Skull: MV 60’/180’ (fly), AC 9, HD 4+4, #AT 1, DG 1d6 + fear or shriek, SV C5, ML +4, AL C

###### Shimmer

Divine 2 Type: protection

Range: self Duration: 6 turns

This spell surrounds the caster with a shimmering aura that grants her a bonus of +2 to armor class and saving throws.

###### Shrouding Fog

Arcane 2 Type: elemental (air), esoteric, wall

Range: 0’ Duration: 1 turn/caster level

This spell conjures a thick misty vapor around the spellcaster. The *shrouding fog* is 10’ in diameter per caster level and 10’ high. Because the spell draws its power from natural air, it can only be cast outdoors or in a well-ventilated room. The *shrouding**fog* is harmless, but blocks line of sight for most creatures. The caster, and any creatures able to see invisible entities, can see dimly through *shrouding**fog*but all others within the cloud are effectively **blinded** until they exit it.

Once created, the *shrouding**fog*can be affected by water or strong winds like an ordinary mist, though other attacks will have correspondingly little effect on it. A *counterspell*, *disintegration***,** or *dispel magic* spell can destroy the *shrouding**fog*instantly; it will otherwise dissipate in 1 turn per caster level.

###### Silent Step

Arcane 1 Type: transmogrification

Range: touch Duration: 1 turn/caster level

This spell allows the recipient to walk with nearly total silence. If the creature is not proficient in Sneaking, it becomes proficient with a Sneaking proficiency throw of 12+. If the creature is already proficient in Sneaking, it gains a +8 bonus to its Sneaking proficiency throws. The recipient must be man-sized or smaller when this spell is cast or it fails to work.

###### Skinchange

Arcane 3, Divine 4 Type: transmogrification

Range: self Duration: 1 turn/caster level

This spell allows the caster to assume the form of a normal or giant animal. (See the Animals type in the ***ACKS II******Monstrous Manual*** for details) that is native to his location. The caster gains the physical capabilities, physical attacks, special abilities, and statistics of the animal form he assumes, while retaining his own mental abilities (including the ability to cast spells). The caster must be man-sized or smaller when he casts this spell or it fails to work.

The caster can change to a new animal form each round. For example, he might initially transform into a rabbit to spy on enemies, change into a lion for a fight, then transform into an eagle to fly away when the fight goes badly. The caster can continue to *skinchange*freely until he reverts to his original form or until 1 turn per level has elapsed. If slain, the caster reverts to his original form.

Because the animal must be native to the caster’s location, the caster cannot transform into dinosaurs or other prehistoric animals unless in a “lost world” where such creatures still roam the earth. Likewise, the caster cannot transform into a whale in the middle of the desert, or into a lion in the tundra.

###### Slicing Blow

Arcane 1 , Divine 2 Type: death

Range: 45’ Duration: instantaneous

This spell allows the caster to necromantically inflict a vicious cut on a target creature within range. The caster must make an attack throw against the target. If the attack throw succeeds, the *slicing blow*deals 1d10 extraordinary slashing damage to the target.

At 3rd level, and every two levels thereafter (5th, 7th, 9th, 11th, and 13th level), the caster gains the ability to inflict an additional *slicing**blow***.** The caster’s *slicing**blows* can all strike at one target or can strike at different targets, as desired; roll a separate attack throw for each *slicing**blow*.

###### Slickness

Arcane 1 Type: elemental (water), wall

Range: touch Duration: 3 turns

This spell creates a slippery magical fluid. It can target one or more objects, a 10’ x 10’ surface area of floor, or a willing creature.

If the target is one or more objects, the affected objects become virtually impossible to grab or hold. The spell can affect 20 arrows, 2 tiny weapons, or 1 small, medium, or large weapon. Creatures attempting to grab an affected object must make an attack against AC 10. If the attack hits, the creature grabs the object. If the attack misses, it fails to grasp it. Creatures holding an affected object must make a Paralysis saving throw at the end of their initiative. If the save fails, the object slips out of the creature’s grasp and falls in a random location within 5’. If the save succeeds, the creature maintains its grip on it. It is possible for a creature to grab an item with its attack but then drop it at the end of their initiative if their save fails.

If the target is an area of floor, any creature starting its initiative in, or moving into, the affected area must make a Paralysis saving throw. If the creature is eligible to use Acrobatics, it gains a +2 bonus to its saving throw. If not, the creature suffers a penalty of -4 if wearing light armor, -6 if wearing medium armor, or -8 if wearing heavy armor. (Natural armor does not impose a penalty.) If the save fails, the creature immediately falls prone. If the save succeeds, the creature can act or continue to act without falling that round. Unlike most wall spells, slickness can be evoked in areas where creatures are present.

If the target is a willing creature, the recipient cannot be **grabbed**, **restrained, wrestled**, or otherwise subject to any other form of bondage, including binding ropes, chains, or cuffs, magical or otherwise. Simply put, nothing can get a grip on a recipient affected by *slickness*.

###### Sling Stone

Arcane 1 , Divine 1 Type: blast, elemental (earth)

Range: 180’ Duration: instantaneous

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Environment** | **No. of Objects** |
| Room, Rubbled | 2d10 |
| Room, Cluttered | 1d10 |
| Room, Sparse | 1d6 |
| Room, Empty | 1d6-3 |
| Barren/Desert/Mountains | 1d10 |
| Hills/Jungle/Scrub/Woods | 1d6 |
| Clear/Grass/Swamp | 1d3 |

This spell allows the caster to magically sling one or more small objects at targets within range. The caster can sling up to one object per level of experience. The objects can be slung at one target or distributed across several targets, as desired. The spellcaster must make a successful attack throw with each object. Each object that successfully hits deals 1d4 bludgeoning damage to its target.

To be slung by this spell, an object must be either in the caster’s hands or lying on the ground within 5’; must be made of clay, stone, or metal; and must weigh no more than 8 ounces. Most casters will carry a pouch of sling stones or bullets for use with this spell, but if necessary, a caster may resort to slinging objects that are littering the ground nearby. The Judge may randomly determine how many eligible objects are nearby based on the caster’s environment by rolling on the adjoining table.

###### Slumber

Arcane 1 , Divine 2 Type: enchantment

Range: 180’ Duration: 1 turn/caster level

This spell can put to sleep any living targets with fewer than 5 HD situated within a 10’ diameter sphere. Each target with 2 HD or more can make a Paralysis saving throw. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect. If the save fails, or if the target has fewer than 2 HD, the target begins **slumbering**. A slumbering creature is **helpless**, **blind**, **deaf**, and **mute**. Attacking, damaging, or moving a slumbering creature awakens it, but normal noise does not until the expiration of the spell.

###### Slumber, Deep

Arcane 4 , Divine 6 Type: enchantment

Range: 180’ Duration: 1 turn/caster level

This spell can put to sleep any living targets situated within a 20’ diameter sphere. Each target in the sphere must make a Paralysis saving throw. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect. If the save fails, the target is **slumbering**. A slumbering creature is **helpless**, **blind**, **deaf**, and **mute**. Attacking, damaging, or moving a slumbering creature awakens it, but normal noise does not.

###### Smite Undead\*

Divine 4 Type: necromancy

Range: 225’ (touch)Duration: instantaneous (special)

This spell can destroy one or more undead targets situated within a 60’ diameter sphere. A number of Hit Dice of undead equal to twice caster level can be affected. Undead with the fewest HD are affected first, and undead with 9 HD or more are never affected. Any excess HD of effectiveness are lost. When one or more creatures with the same number of HD are eligible to be targets, the caster can choose which are affected. Affected skeletons and zombies are instantly destroyed. Other affected undead must make a Death saving throw. If the save fails, the undead is instantly destroyed. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect on that undead.

The reverse of this spell, *animate undead*,functions exactly like the 4th level spell of the same name.

###### Snakes to Staffs\*

Divine 4 Type: transmogrification

Range: 45’ Duration: 1 turn per level

This spell can transform one target snake per caster level into a staff of hardwood. Each snake must make a Spells saving throw. If the save fails, it is transformed into an inert piece of wood of approximately the same size. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect on that snake. When the spell expires or if it is dispelled, the snake returns to its original form. If the snake’s wooden form was damaged, then when it returns to snake form, it suffers equivalent damage. If the snake’s wooden form was broken, when it returns to snake form it is slain. Treat snake-staffs as wooden objects with AC 0 and structural hit points equal to one-fifth the snake’s hit points.

The reverse Of this spell, *staffs to snakes*, spell transforms one target branch, bow, stick, staff or other piece of lengthy hardwood per caster level into a snake of the caster’s choice. Magic rods, staffs, and wands cannot be affected by this spell, but nonmagical wood can be targeted even if carried by a creature. If the target staff is being carried by a creature, the creature can make a Spells saving throw to resist the effect. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect on that staff. If the save fails, the carried staff is turned into a snake while still in the creature’s grasp; the snake receives an immediate attack against the creature carrying it, as if it were readied.

The newly-formed snakes begin to act on the next round on their own initiative. They are not under the command of the caster unless he uses a class power, proficiency, or spell to befriend, **bewitch**, **dominate**, or otherwise influence them. The snakes return to being pieces of wood when the spell expires or is **dispelled**.

###### Soul Eating

Arcane 6 Type: death, necromancy

Range: touch Duration: 1 day

The caster can draw and devour the soul from a living target, temporarily gaining a fraction of the victim’s knowledge and vigor. The spell is usually cast on bound and helpless victims. The target must make a Death saving throw.

Even if the saving throw succeeds, the target is still slain, but his soul eludes the caster’s grasp. If the saving throw fails, the target is slain and his soul is eaten by the caster. Targets whose souls are eaten cannot be restored to life by any means short of a *miracle* or *wish*. The caster immediately gains 1d10 temporary hit points + 1 hp per level of the target. In addition, the caster learns some important knowledge possessed by the target, either a specific set of facts that the caster was seeking or some random knowledge chosen by the Judge. The knowledge learned can be quite complex, equivalent to a single rank in a proficiency, a class power, a spell formula, or a language.

The temporary hit points will disappear at the expiration of the spell’s duration, while the knowledge will fade as if it was a barely-remembered dream. Nothing prevents a caster from writing down the knowledge gained from this spell before it fades, however.

EXAMPLE: Ra-Ramses wishes to plumb the depths of the dungeon of his rival, Baldur the Black. Baldur’s dungeon is reputed to be a deadly maze filled with traps, secret doors, and foul guardians, so Ra-Ramses abducts Archimedian, the engineer who built the dungeon, and casts *soul eating* on him. Archimedian (a 5th level mage) fails his Death saving throw, so his soul is eaten by Ra-Ramses. Ra-Ramses gains 1d10+5 hp. The Judge decides that having complete knowledge of the layout and design of Baldur’s dungeon is equivalent to the Mapping proficiency, and thus within the purview of the spell. Ra-Ramses now has a day to exploit this knowledge, either by venturing into the dungeon immediately or by spending a day drafting maps.

While *soul**eating*is in effect, the spellcaster is treated as an inherently evil creature for purposes of *discern**evil*and *holy circle*effects. A successful *counterspell, dispel**evil*or *dispel**magic*spell will strip the caster of his temporary proficiency and hit points.

###### Soul Swap

Arcane 5 Type: esoteric, necromancy

Range: 45’Duration: indefinite

The caster transfers his soul into an inanimate object known as a phylactery. The phylactery can be an amulet, gem, jewelry box, locket, ring, or other item weighing 1/6 stone or less with no more than 1 shp. At the moment the spell is cast, the phylactery must be within spell range and the caster must know where it is, though he does not need to be able to see it. As soon as the caster transfers his soul into the phylactery, his physical body falls limp, seemingly lifeless. (A character who spends a round inspecting the body and makes a successful Healing proficiency throw to diagnose can ascertain that the body is alive in a state of suspended animation.)

From the phylactery, the caster can use an action in lieu of attacking to return to his own body if it is within 120’ of the phylactery. Alternatively, he can use an action in lieu of attacking to attempt to possess the body of a nearby living creature within 120’ of the phylactery. The target creature is allowed a Death saving throw to resist. If the creature succeeds on its saving throw, the caster’s soul remains in the phylactery, and the target creature is immune to further attempts at possession for one turn (10 minutes). If the creature fails its saving throw, its body becomes possessed by the caster’s soul, while the creature’s soul becomes imprisoned in the phylactery. While possessing a creature’s body, the caster keeps his or her Intellect, Will, Charisma, level, class, attack bonus, saving throws, and mental abilities (including spellcasting ability), but gains the body’s Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, hit points, and natural abilities. The caster does not have access to any special abilities of the body, however.

From a possessed body, the caster can take use an action in lieu of moving to abandon the body and return his soul to the phylactery, simultaneously releasing the trapped soul back to its own body. The spell ends when the caster’s soul returns to his own body, leaving the phylactery empty.

If the caster’s soul is in the phylactery, and the phylactery is destroyed or **dispelled**, then there are two possible outcomes. If the phylactery is within 120’ of the caster’s body, then the caster’s soul returns to its body. Otherwise, the caster’s soul departs and he dies. In either case, the spell ends.

If the caster’s soul is driven from a possessed body by *dispel evil* there are also two possibilities. If the phylactery is within 120’ of the possessed body, then the caster’s soul returns to the phylactery, and the possessed body’s soul returns to it. The caster cannot attempt to possess the same creature again for one full turn (10 minutes). If the phylactery is not in range of the possessed body, then the possessed creature’s spirit is freed from the phylactery, both the caster’s and the possessed body’s souls depart, and both the caster and the possessed creature die. In either case, the spell ends.

If a possessed creature’s soul is in thephylactery, and the phylactery is broken then one of the following may happen. If the phylactery is in range of the possessed creature’s body, then the caster’s spirit departs, the caster dies, the possessed creature’s soul returns to its body, and the spell ends. Otherwise, the possessed creature’s soul departs, and the caster’s soul is stranded in the possessed body. Note here that the spell has not ended. *Dispel**evil* can still be used to drive the caster’s spirit from the body, which departs as noted, ending the spell. In any case where the spell ends with the caster’s body unoccupied by a spirit, that body does truly die.

###### Speak with Beasts

Divine 2 Type: esoteric

Range: special Duration: 6 turns

This spell grants the caster the ability to communicate with ordinary and giant animals that are within his line of sight and able to hear him. The spell magically translates the animals’ natural vocalizations into language comprehensible to the caster. However, the spell doesn’t make the animals friendlier or smarter. Most animals, being of bestial sapiency, can only relay concrete facts punctuated with inane comments. Semi-sapient animals, such as dolphins, elephants, or parrots, can communicate concepts and opinions, though they will tend to be terse and evasive. However, if an animal is friendly towards the caster, it might be willing to grant some favor or service. *Speak with beasts* does not permit conversation with sapient creatures.

###### Speak with Dead

Arcane 3, Divine 3 Type: esoteric, necromancy

Range: 10’ Duration: 1 turn

This spell grants the caster the ability to communicate with a target corpse or skeleton. The target corpse or skeleton must have come from a sapient living creature and must still have a largely-intact brain or skull with a mouth or jawbone. If both the brain and skull have rotted away or been destroyed, the target does not remember anything. If both the mouth or jawbone have rotted away or been destroyed, the target cannot answer any questions. When someone is slain to keep them quiet, the killer will often bash in the skull, cut away the brain, and remove the lips and jaw to avoid the remains being able to answer questions.

The caster may ask the target corpse or skeleton one question per two caster levels. He may ask questions at the rate of one per round; each question is answered by the corpse or skeleton during the same round. Unasked questions are wasted if the duration expires. The corpse’s knowledge is limited to what the creature knew during life, including the languages it spoke (if any). Answers are often brief, cryptic, or repetitive. Any given corpse or skeleton can only be targeted by this spell once per week.

*Speak with dead* does not actually contact the deceased creature’s soul. Instead, it draws on the remnants of spiritual residue that still linger in the corpse or skeleton. Thus, the remains possess only the knowledge that the creature had while alive, but not any information about events that transpired after its death or experiences in the afterlife. For instance, the corpse of a man who was slain by bugbears and then ritually impaled on a chthonic totem would remember everything up to the moment of its death, but would have no information about the ritual that caused its impalement or about what life is like in heaven or his current reincarnation.

This spell cannot target a corpse or skeleton that is or was ever animated as an undead creature.

###### Speak with Plants

Divine 4 Type: esoteric

Range: 45’ Duration: 3 turns

This spell grants the caster the ability to communicate with both ordinary mindless plants and semi-sapient or sapient plant creatures that are within his line of sight. The spell magically translates the plants’ biochemical, electrical, and mycocultural messages into language comprehensible to the caster. However, the spell doesn’t make the plants friendlier or smarter.

Ordinary plants, being rather vegetative, communicate freely with the caster, as they have nothing else better to do. They will gossip endlessly about things such as their ambitions for taller branches, more leaves, or deeper roots; the poor or robust health of neighboring plants; the ease or difficulty of getting enough sunshine; the existence of any caverns, dungeons, or objects buried impinging on their root networks; the causes of damage that nearby plants have suffered; the proximity and nature of other nearby plants; the proximity and nature of nearby plant predators (i.e. herbivores); the proximity and nature of symbiotic creatures that help the plant flourish (e.g. honey bees); the general weather and soil conditions they have experienced; and, of course, their existential dread of being eaten.

Semi-sapient and sapient plant creatures can communicate in much the same fashion as any other monster, but will tend to be terse and evasive. However, if a plant creature is friendly towards the caster, it might be willing to grant some favor or service.

###### Spectral Figment

Arcane 4 , Divine 6 Type: illusion

Range: 360’ Duration: concentration + 3 rounds

This spell creates a multi-sensory illusion of an area, object, creature, or force, as visualized by the caster, up to a maximum size of 40’ x 40’x 40’. The illusion includes visual, auditory, olfactory, tactile, and thermal components. The caster can move the figment within the limits of the size of the effect. The figment persists so long as the caster maintains concentration, plus an additional 3 rounds after the caster ceases to concentrate, expiring at the end of the caster’s next initiative.

If used to create the illusion of one or more creatures, the illusory creatures have AC 0 and 1 hp; they immediately disappear if hit in combat. If used to simulate an attack spell or an attacking creature, the illusory attack and damage done should be resolved by the Judge as if it were real. However, any creature affected by illusory damage receives a Spells saving throw to disbelieve the illusion. If the save succeeds, the creature takes no damage and realizes the *spectral figment* is an illusion. If the save fails, the creature believes it has been damaged, possibly fainting into unconsciousness if it believes its hit points have been reduced to 0 or fewer. However, the illusory damage is not real. A “killed” or “injured” creature realizes it is unharmed at the end of its initiative in 1d6 rounds, and thereafter knows the *spectral**figment*is an illusion.

A creature who encounters a *spectral**figment* and has reason to be suspicious about its reality can make a Spells saving throw to disbelieve it at the start of its initiative. If the save succeeds, the creature confirms the *spectral**figment* is an illusion and can see, hear, smell, taste, or feel anything the figment is concealing. If the save fails, the creature continues to believe it is real. The creature cannot attempt to disbelieve the *spectral**figment*again until it has further evidence of its illusory nature (e.g. a friend tells him “it’s an illusion,” etc.).

###### Spectral Legion

Arcane 5 Type: illusion

Range: 360’ Duration: concentration

This spell was created for use by war-wizards on the field of battle. It creates a multi-sensory illusion of a complete military unit of up to 120 man-sized creatures, 60 large (cavalry or ogre-sized) creatures, 20 huge creatures, 5 gigantic creatures, or 1 colossal creature. The unit can be of any type, equipped with any arms or armor desired, wearing whatever colors, insignia, and unit markings the caster wishes. It can appear fresh and well-ordered, or bloodied and demoralized, or anything in between.

Once the *spectral**legion* is conjured, it can be moved anywhere within range at the same speed as an actual unit of its type. The *spectral**legion*moves on the caster’s own initiative. The illusion is fully dynamic, so the unit will seem to march, trot, gallop, fly, or otherwise actually move, and as it does so its boots will seemingly kick up dust, its banners will seemingly wave in the breeze, and so on. The *spectral**legion*will remain on the battlefield for as long as the caster maintains concentration.

If attacked, the illusory creatures that make up the *spectral**legion*appear to have the AC of a real unit of their type. If damaged, the creatures will appear to suffer wounds, but are never slain and do not vanish. If the spectral legion attacks, the illusory attack and damage should be resolved by the Judge as if it were real. However, any creature affected by illusory damage receives a Spells saving throw to disbelieve the illusion. If the save succeeds, the creature takes no damage and realizes the *spectral**legion* is an illusion. If the save fails, the creature believes it has been damaged, possibly fainting into unconsciousness if it believes its hit points have been reduced to 0 or fewer. However, the illusory damage is not real. A “killed” or “injured” creature realizes it is unharmed at the end of its initiative in 1d6 rounds, and thereafter knows the *spectral**legion*is an illusion.

A creature who encounters a *spectral**legion* and has reason to be suspicious about its reality can make a Spells saving throw to disbelieve it at the start of its initiative. If the save succeeds, the creature confirms the *spectral**legion* is an illusion and can see, hear, smell, taste, or feel anything it is concealing. If the save fails, the creature continues to believe it is real. The creature cannot attempt to disbelieve the *spectral**legion*again until it has further evidence of its illusory nature (e.g. a friend tells him “it’s an illusion,” he notices that no matter how often he hits an illusory creature it never dies, etc.).

###### Spellward

Arcane 3 , Divine 3 Type: protection

Range: self Duration: 6 turns

This spell creates a defensive ward around the caster. The *spellward* has a number of layers equal to caster level. When the caster makes a saving throw against a spell, elemental effect, or spell-like effect, he can expend one or more layers of the *spellward* to gain a +1d4 bonus per layer to the saving throw. After the saving throw (if any) is resolved, the caster can expend one or more layers of the *spellward* to reduce the damage by 1d4 points per layer. If the damage is reduced to 0 or less by the *spellward*, the caster does not suffer an interruption of concentration or other effects that may accrue upon being hit. If a *spellwarded* caster is subjected to a *counterspell* or *dispel magic* spell, he can expend one or more layers from the ward to increase his effective caster level by 1d4 per layer, making it harder to **dispel** his magic. *Spellward* expires when all of the layers are expended, or after 6 turns, whichever comes first. If this spell is made *permanent* through ritual magic, the *spellward* recharges two layers per turn.

EXAMPLE: Quintus, a 6th level caster, is in a magical duel! He had previously cast *spellward*, and as a 6th level caster his ward has six layers. He is in the middle of casting *thunderbolt* when his opponent strikes him with a *fireball* that deals 21 fire damage. Quintus expends one layer of the ward to gain a +1d4 bonus on the saving throw. His save then succeeds, halving the damage to 10 points. He then expends the last five layers of the ward to reduce the damage by 5d4 points. He rolls the dice and the result is a 12! The damage has been reduced to 0 or less, and his spell is not interrupted. On his initiative number, he blasts his opponent with *thunderbolt!*

###### Spellward Other

Arcane 4 , Divine 4 Type: protection

Range: touch Duration: 6 turns

This spell creates a defensive ward around the recipient. The *spellward* has a number of layers equal to caster level. When the recipient makes a saving throw against a spell, elemental effect, or spell-like effect, it can expend one or more layers of the *spellward* to gain a +1d4 bonus per layer to the saving throw. After the saving throw (if any) is resolved, the recipient can expend one or more layers of the *spellward* to reduce the damage by 1d4 points per layer. If the damage is reduced to 0 or less by the *spellward*, the recipient does not suffer an interruption of concentration or other effects that may accrue upon being hit. If a *spellwarded* recipient is subjected to *counterspell* or *dispel magic* spell, it can expend one or more layers from the ward to increase his effective caster level by 1d4 per layer, making it harder to **dispel** his magic. *Spellward**other* expires when all of the layers are expended, or after 6 turns, whichever comes first. If this spell is made *permanent* through ritual magic, the *spellward* recharges two layers per turn.

###### Spellwarded Zone

Arcane 6 , Divine 6 Type: protection

Range: touch Duration: 6 turns

This spell creates a defensive ward that protects a 20’ diameter sphere. The *spellward* has a number of layers equal to caster level. The *spellward*automatically triggers whenever a spell, elemental effect, or spell-like effect would affect the area. If a spell, elemental effect, or spell-like effect affects an area that is inclusive of the *spellwarded**zone*, but also affects areas outside the *zone*, the *spellward*will trigger, but its protection only extends to its own area of effect.

EXAMPLE: Quintus, Marcus, Balbus, and Viktir are standing in a large amphitheater, 100’ in radius, the four of them strung out in a line 5’ apart. Quintus, now an 11th level caster, has cast *spellwarded**zone*on a 20’ diameter sphere centered on himself. He, Marcus, and Balbus are all standing in the *zone*but Viktir is 5’ outside its perimeter. Ramses-Ra calls down a 14th level *fireball*with a 20’ diameter area of effect that strikes the area where Viktir, Balbus, and Marcus are standing. The *spellward*is triggered, but Viktir will not benefit from its protection.

If the triggering effect allows for a saving throw, one layer of the *spellward* will be automatically expended to provide a +1d4 bonus to the saving throw for the affected area and/or any creature(s) in the area.

EXAMPLE: Ramses-Ra has brought down a 14th level *fireball*on Viktir, Balbus, and Marcus. It deals 50 fire damage! However, Balbus and Marcus are in a *spellwarded**zone* with 11 layers.The *spellward*is triggered, and one of its layers is automatically expended to provides a +1d4 bonus to Balbus and Marcus’s saving throws. The die roll is a 3, so both Balbus and Marcus get a +3 bonus to their save. Balbus succeeds, but Marcus rolls badly and fails despite the bonus. Viktir, meanwhile, does not get the bonus, but he manages a lucky roll of 19 and succeeds anyway. The *fireball*will deal 50 fire damage to Marcus and 25 fire damage to Balbus and Viktir.

If the triggering effect deals damage, one layer of the *spellward*will be automatically expended for every 5 points of damage the effect deals (ignore any reduction from saving throws), up to the maximum number of layers. Each layer expended reduces the damage by 1d4 points. If the damage is reduced to 0 or less by the *spellward*, then any creature(s) in the area are entirely unharmed, and do not suffer an interruption of concentration or other effects that may accrue upon being hit.

EXAMPLE: Ramses-Ra’s *fireball*is dealing 50 fire damage. Therefore (50/5) 10 layers of the *spellward*are automatically expended in order to reduce the damage by 10d4 points. The dice roll results in 30 points of damage reduction. Balbus, whose save succeeded, therefore takes no damage. Marcus, whose save failed, takes (50-30) 20 fire damage. Viktir, whose save succeeded, takes 25 fire damage because he is outside the *spellwarded**zone*.

If the *spellwarded* *zone* is subjected to *counterspell* or *dispel magic* spell, it will expend one layer of the ward per two caster levels of the dispel in order to increase its effective caster level by 1d4 per layer, making it harder to dispel the *zone*. *Spellward**zone* expires when all of the layers are expended, or after 6 turns, whichever comes first. If this spell is made *permanent* through ritual magic, the *spellward* recharges two layers per turn.

###### Sphere of Invulnerability, Greater

Arcane 6 , Divine 6 Type: protection

Range: self Duration: 1 round/caster level

This spell is identical to the 4th level spell *lesser**sphere**of**invulnerability*, except that it prevents up to 4th level spells or spell effects from penetrating.

###### Sphere of Invulnerability, Lesser

Arcane 4 , Divine 4 Type: protection

Range: self Duration: 1 round/caster level

This spell creates a magical sphere of protection in a 5’ radius around the caster which prevents any 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level spells or spell effects from penetrating. The area of effect of any such spells will exclude the area protected by the *sphere*. However, 4th and higher level spells are not affected by the *sphere*. *Lesser**sphere**of**invulnerability*does not restrict spells from being cast out,and these spells can pass from the caster through the *sphere*and to their target freely. A *lesser**sphere**of**invulnerability*can be **dispelled** normally.

###### Spider Climbing

Arcane 1 Type: transmogrification

Range: touch Duration: 3 turns

This spell grants its recipient the ability to climb sheer surfaces. If the recipient is not proficient in Climbing, he gains the Climbing proficiency for the duration of the spell.

If the recipient is already proficient in Climbing, he gains the ability to climb utterly unimpeded across vertical surfaces and to hang upside down from ceilings. The recipient can climb at his combat movement rate. He can attack with a tiny, small, or medium weapon, cast spells, and defend himself normally, but cannot charge or run while climbing.

In either case, the recipient must have at least three limbs (hands and feet) free but needs no climbing gear or handholds.

###### Spirit of Healing

Divine 4 Type: healing

Range: 90’ Duration: 1 round/caster level

This spell creates a divine force that may be used to heal a recipient of 1d6+1 damage each round. The *spirit of healing*may continue to heal the same creature on subsequent rounds, or it may be directed to heal another creature instead. The caster must concentrate for the duration of the spell. If the caster loses concentration, the *spirit**of**healing*vanishes and the spell ends.

As with other **cure** spells, the *spirit**of**healing*may be used to cure a creature of paralysis in lieu of curing any damage, and the spell will never increase a creature’s hit points beyond the normal amount.

###### Spiritwalk

Divine 5 Type: esoteric, transmogrification

Range: self Duration: 1 hour/caster level

The spell places the caster into a deep trance, during which his body becomes **helpless** but his spirit can walk free of his body. The caster must be man-sized or smaller when he casts this spell or it fails to work.

The caster’s spirit resembles his body, but is slightly translucent and entirely incorporeal. The spirit appears as if dressed in whatever armor or clothing the caster was wearing when the spell was cast, though this is purely cosmetic. The caster’s spirit cannot affect corporeal creatures or objects unless using spells. It cannot benefit from, carry, use, or wear items. The spirit cannot see into, hear sounds from, or move through an area warded by an *anti-magic sphere*or *holy**circle* or similar effect. Except for these limitations, the spirit can see, hear, speak, move, cast spells, and otherwise act as if it were the caster. The spirit can freely pass through solid objects without difficulty, though it cannot see through them. The caster’s spirit has the same number of hit points as the caster’s body at the time of casting, but thereafter body and spirit are damaged separately. If the caster’s spirit is reduced to 0 hp, the spirit is destroyed. Fortunately, because it is incorporeal, the caster’s spirit can only be damaged by magic weapons or by spells or effects dealing extraordinary damage. If the caster himself has natural weapons in his physical form, the caster’s spirit possesses those natural weapons as well; they deal extraordinary damage to incorporeal targets but cannot harm corporeal targets.

Once a *spiritwalk* begins, it continues until the caster’s spirit returns to his body, the caster’s spirit is destroyed, the caster’s body is slain, or the spell is **dispelled**. The caster can voluntarily return his spirit to his body at the start of his initiative. When the spirit and body reunite, any damage the spirit has suffered is dealt to the body as well. If the *spiritwalking* character’s spirit is destroyed, or if the spell expires before the caster’s soul has returned, his body falls into a catatonic slumber that can only be lifted with *restore**life**and**limb*,*resurrection*, *miracle*, or *wish*. If the *spiritwalking* character’s body is destroyed, the character dies at the end of the *spiritwalk*.

###### Spiritual Weapon

Divine 2 Type: blast, esoteric

Range: 45’ Duration: 1 round/level

This spell causes a weapon made of pure force to spring into existence, attacking any foe chosen by the divine spellcaster within range once per round. It deals 1d6 extraordinary luminous damage per strike, +1 point per three caster levels (maximum of +4). It uses the caster’s normal attack throws. If the *spiritual**weapon* goes beyond the spell range, the caster loses sight of it, or the caster ceases to direct it, the weapon disappears. The weapon cannot be attacked or harmed by physical attacks, but can be **dispelled** or **disintegrated**. The *spiritual**weapon* will be of a type appropriate to the caster and his deity.

###### Strength of Mind\*

Divine 5 Type: protection

Range: touch Duration: 12 turns

This spell grants the recipient creature touched a +4 bonus to its Death, Implements, Paralysis, and Spells saving throw.

The reverse spell, *weakness**of**mind,* decreases the target creature touched a -4 penalty to its Death, Implements, Paralysis, and Spells saving throws. No saving throw is allowed against *weakness**of**mind*.

###### Strengthen the Unliving

Arcane 3 , Divine 3 Type: necromancy

Range: 45’ Duration: 1 turn

This spell strengthens one or more undead creatures within range. The caster can strengthen a number of Hit Dice of undead equal to his caster level. Each strengthened undead gains 1d10 temporary hit points + 1 additional temporary hp per caster level. These temporary hit points will be the first lost if any damage is suffered, but cannot be regained through healing magic, and will disappear at the expiration of the spell’s duration.

###### Striking

Divine 3 Type: transmogrification

Range: 45’ Duration: 3 turns

This spell imbues one weapon within range the ability to deal 1d6 additional extraordinary luminous or necrotic damage. This extra damage is applied on each successful attack for the duration of the spell. It provides no bonus to attack throws, but if cast on a normal weapon, the spell allows the weapon to damage creatures that are immune to physical damage. Only the 1d6 points of extraordinary luminous damage applies to such a monster, however.

###### Sudden Staircase

Arcane 2 Type: wall

Range: 360’ Duration: 1 turn

This spell conjures a staircase of arcane energy into existence. The *sudden staircase*must begin in contact with the ground, or a structure on the ground, and must be solidly supported at both its origin and terminus point. The dimensions of the individual steps can be at most 1’ tall and 5’ wide. The dimensions of the *sudden**staircase* as a whole depend on whether the caster conjures a straight, u-shaped, or spiraling staircase:

* If straight, the staircase can be as large as 250’ long and 5’ wide with a rise of up to 250’ over its length.
* If u-shaped, the staircase can be as small as 15’ long and 10’ wide with a rise of up to 180’ over its length, or as large as 200’ and 10’ wide with a rise of up to 200’.
* If spiraling, the staircase can be as small as 5’ in radius while retaining a rise of up to 250’ over its length. However, the steps are so narrow and wedge-shaped that speeds up or down the spiraling staircase are reduced by half.

The *sudden**staircase* can be conjured at any point within the spell’s range, but the entire length and rise of the staircase must be in range. The caster cannot evoke the *sudden**staircase* such that it appears on or on top of creatures. The *sudden**staircase*lasts until *disintegrated* or **dispelled** or until one turn elapses, whichever comes first.

###### Summon Hellhounds

Arcane 3 Type: summoning

Range: 10’ Duration: 1 month

This spell summons 2 **lesser hellhounds** from the Elemental Sphere of Fire to do the caster’s bidding (see the ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual*** for details). The number of hellhounds summoned is increased to 3 if the caster is 9th level, 4 if the caster is 12th level or higher, and 5 if 14th level or higher. The hellhounds appear anywhere within range and act on their own initiative each round thereafter. When the hellhounds are summoned, the caster must task them with a single objective, such as guarding a location or hunting down a particular creature. The task must be stated aloud, though it can stated in any language he speaks. The spell expires when this task is completed or one month elapses, whichever comes first. Hellhounds are hateful, evil creatures who wish to see the world burn, and they will always interpret their orders in order to maximize the destruction they can inflict. The hellhounds will vanish when destroyed or **dispelled** or when the spell expires. This complex invocation requires one turn to cast, and because of its soul-blasting nature, it cannot be cast more than once per week.

###### Summon Insect Plague

Divine 5 Type: summoning (summons)

Range: 30’ Duration: 1 day

This spell summons a plague of **insect swarms** from the dark places of the earth (see the ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual*** for details). The insect swarms collectively have a number of Hit Dice equal to twice the caster’s level; each individual insect swarm has 2 HD. For instance, a 14th level caster will summon 14 2 HD swarms. Each swarm occupies a 20’ x 10’ area. The insect swarms form anywhere within range and act on their own initiative each round thereafter.

The caster can give verbal orders to the swarms when they arrive and thereafter as an action in lieu of moving anytime the swarms are in line of sight. Orders can be given in any language the caster speaks. The swarms will mindlessly obey whatever orders they are given to the best of their ability. They cannot accomplish tasks that require abstract thought or higher reasoning. If the swarms complete all of their orders, or for whatever reason are physically unable to obey their orders, they will simply remain stationary until they receive new orders. The insect swarms will vanish when destroyed or **dispelled**, or when the spell expires. This complex invocation requires one turn to cast, and because of its soul-blasting nature, it cannot be cast more than once per day.

###### Summon Insect Swarm

Arcane 2 Type: summoning (summons)

Range: 10’ Duration: 1 day

This spell summons one or more **insect swarms** from the dark places of the earth (see the ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual*** for details). The insect swarms collectively have a number of Hit Dice equal to caster level; each individual insect swarm has 2 HD. For instance, a 6th level caster will summon three 2 HD swarms. Excess HD are lost. Each swarm occupies a 10’ x 10’ area. The insect swarms form anywhere within range and act on their own initiative each round thereafter. The caster can give verbal orders to the swarms in the same manner described for *summon insect plague*. The insect swarms will vanish when destroyed or **dispelled**, or when the spell expires. This complex invocation requires one turn to cast, and because of its soul-blasting nature, it cannot be cast more than once per day.

###### Summon Invisible Stalker

Arcane 6 Type: summoning

Range: 10’ Duration: indefinite

This spell summons an **invisible stalker** from the Outer Darkness to do his bidding (see the ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual*** for details). The invisible stalker can be summoned anywhere within range and acts on its own initiative each round thereafter. When the invisible stalker is summoned, the caster must task it with a single objective, such as guarding a location or hunting down a particular creature. The task must be stated aloud, though it can be stated in any language he speaks. The spell expires when this task is completed or one month elapses, whichever comes first. However, invisible stalkers resent protracted missions and complex tasks and will seek to pervert their instructions accordingly. The invisible stalker will vanish when destroyed or **dispelled** or when the spell expires. Because of the soul-blasting nature of this spell, it requires one turn (10 minutes) to cast, and cannot be cast more than once per week.

###### Summon Manes

Arcane 1 Type: summoning (summons)

Range: 45’ Duration: 1 day

This spell summons one **manes** per level of experience to serve the caster (see the ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual*** for details). The manes appear anywhere within range and act on their own initiative each round thereafter. The caster can give verbal orders to the manes when they arrive and thereafter as an action in lieu of moving anytime they are in line of sight. Orders can be given in any language the caster speaks. The spirits will obey whatever orders they are given to the best of their ability. If the manes complete all of their orders, or for whatever reason are physically unable to obey their orders, they will return to the caster to receive new orders. The manes vanish when destroyed or **dispelled**, or when the spell expires. This complex invocation requires one turn to cast, and because of its taxing nature, it cannot be cast more than once per day.

###### Summon Ooze

Arcane 5 Type: summoning (summons)

Range: 10’ Duration: 1 day

This spell summons the caster’s choice of a **gelatinous mass**, **grey goo**, **mustard mold,** or **sage slime** from the dark places of the earth (see the ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual***for details). The summoned ooze appears anywhere within range and act on its own initiative each round thereafter. The caster can give verbal orders to the ooze when it arrives and thereafter as an action in lieu of moving anytime the ooze is in line of sight. Orders can be given in any language the caster speaks. The ooze will mindlessly obey whatever orders it is given to the best of its (limited) ability. It cannot accomplish tasks that require abstract thought or higher reasoning. If the ooze completes all of its orders, or for whatever reason is physically unable to obey its orders, it will move to consume the nearest target edible to it. The summoned ooze will vanish when destroyed or **dispelled**, or when the spell expires. This complex invocation requires one turn to cast, and because of its soul-blasting nature, it cannot be cast more than once per day.

###### Summon Shadow

Arcane 4 Type: summoning (summons)

Range: 10’ Duration: 1 week

This spell summons a **shadow** from the Outer Darkness to serve him (see the ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual*** for details). The shadow appears anywhere within range and act on its own initiative each round thereafter. The caster can give verbal orders to the shadow when it arrives and thereafter as an action in lieu of moving anytime the shadow is in line of sight. Orders can be given in any language the caster speaks. The summoned shadow will obey the caster’s orders. However, shadows are hateful creatures inimical to all life, and will always attempt to twist the meaning of their orders to wreak as much evil as possible. More than one spellcaster has seen friends and lovers damned by the depredations of such minions. The shadow will vanish when destroyed or **dispelled**, or when the spell expires. This complex invocation requires one turn to cast, and because of its soul-blasting nature, it cannot be cast more than once per week.

###### Summon Weather

Arcane 5, Divine 6 Type: elemental (air), esoteric

Range: special Duration: 1 week

This spell summons weather to the spellcaster’s location, changing the temperature, precipitation, and wind in a three-mile radius around the caster (one 6-mile hex on a regional map). The summoned weather must be of a natural and routine type that regularly occurs in that location at that time of year. The spell is usually employed to endweather conditions that are unnatural or extraordinary for the location and time. For instance, the caster might summon a rainstorm to relieve an unseasonable drought with rain, or might summon a warm and cloudless sky to bring an end to an unusually severe thunderstorm. Freak weather (such as snow in summer) cannot be summoned. Natural disasters (such as blizzards, hurricanes, typhoons, or tornados) can be summoned but only in locations and at times where they occur regularly and the caster has no control over the exact manifestation of the disaster. For instance, a caster in “tornado country” could summon a tornado, but he could not control exactly where it appeared and what path it took. This complex spell requires one turn to cast, and the summoned weather gradually arrives over the course of the turn. See p. XX for further rules on weather.

**Designer’s Note:** If the Judge is using the weather rules found in the ***ACKS II Judges Journal****,* in which weather is set with a roll of 2d6 for temperature, precipitation, and wind, then this spell allows the caster to choose the result for each instead of rolling.

###### Summon Winged Herald

Divine 6 Type: summoning (summons)

Range: 10’ Duration: Sunrise

The caster summons a 13 HD **herald** **angel** from the Empyrean Heaven to aid the faith (see the ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual*** for details). This might invocation can only be cast once per week and requires a full turn to cast. The caster must be in a sacrosanct pinnacle of good devoted to the Empyrean gods. When the spell is complete, the herald angel arrives somewhere within range, usually at the altar, apex, or other majestic center of the pinnacle of good.

The herald angel acts on its own initiative. As a great-souled champion of Law, it will assist the caster in the pursuit of great deeds that serve and protect civilization. It will not pursue tasks that its deems beneath its majesty, nor courses of action that are motivated by greed or malice or that work towards Chaotic or even Neutral ends. Any such requests will cause the herald angel to vanish. If the herald angel ever learns or even believes the caster is in violation of his code of behavior, or that the caster or his allies are not allies of Law, the angel also vanishes. Otherwise, the herald angel will vanish when destroyed or **dispelled** or at the next sunrise.

By tradition, the spell is cast at dawn to maximize the available duration, but there is no penalty (save the shorter duration) if the caster summons the herald angel in the afternoon, evening, or night.

###### Sunder Structure

Arcane 4 Type: blast, elemental (earth)

Range: touch Duration: instantaneous

The spell can obliterate a target structure such as a bridge, cliff, tower, or wall. The caster must make a melee attack throw against the structure’s AC (typically 2 for wooden and 6 for stone structures) using a staff or similar weapon. If the attack throw succeeds, the target structure is instantly dealt 250 extraordinary seismic structural damage to stone (enough to destroy one story of a tower or a 30’ length of wall) or 1,250 extraordinary seismic structural damage to wood. Structures with multiple stories have a separate shp per story, and each story must be breached or destroyed separately; destroying a lower story will destroy all upper stories, however. If the target structure is destroyed, each creature on or wIthin it must make a Blast saving throw. If the save fails, the creature suffers 5d6 bludgeoning damage from collapsing rubble. If the save succeeds, the creature suffers half that damage.

###### Sunflare

Arcane 2 , Divine 4 Type: blast, elemental (fire)

Range: 180’Duration: instantaneous

This spell calls down a column of sunfire 40’ in height and 20’ in diameter at a target point. Each creature within the area of effect must make a Blast saving throw. If the save fails, the creature suffers 3d6 extraordinary luminous fire damage. If the save succeeds, the creature suffers half that damage. *Sunflare* deals double damage against undead creatures.

The*sunflare* can also damage structures in its area of effect. It deals up to 3d6 extraordinary luminous fire structural damage to wooden structures and one-third that damage to stone structures. (It might deal less if the structure is not entirely in its area of effect.) The *sunflare* causes combustibles to ignite.

Because it relies on the power of the sun, this spell can only be cast if the caster is standing in direct sunlight. If this spell is targeted at a point indoors or underground, the *sunflare* will strike the ceiling or surface above the desired area of effect. If the damage caused to an interposing barrier shatters or breaks through it, the *sunflare* will continue beyond the barrier in order to attain its full volume.

###### Swift Sword

Divine 2 Type: movement

Range: self Duration: 6 rounds

This spell accelerates the attacks of the caster, allowing her to make one additional attack per round for the duration of the spell. Movement and spellcasting are not accelerated, nor is the use of magic items such as wands, which may still be used just once per round. Multiple speed effects don’t combine; only apply the most powerful or longest lasting effect.

###### Swift Sword, Sustained

Divine 3 Type: movement

Range: self Duration: 3 turns

This spell accelerates the attacks of the caster, allowing her to make one additional attack per round for the duration of the spell. Movement and spellcasting are not accelerated, nor is the use of magic items such as wands, which may still be used just once per round. Multiple speed effects don’t combine; only apply the most powerful or longest lasting effect.

###### Swimming

Arcane 2 Type: elemental (water), transmogrification

Range: touch Duration: 6 turns + 1 turn/caster level

The recipient of this spell gains the ability to swim on the surface or underwater at a combat speed of 20’ per round and an encounter speed of 60’ per turn. The recipient must have at least three limbs (hands and feet) free to swim. While swimming, the recipient can charge or run, attack, cast spells, defend itself normally. This spell does notgrant the ability to breathe underwater. The recipient must be man-sized or smaller when this spell is cast or it fails to work.

###### Sword of Fire

Divine 5 Type: elemental (fire), esoteric, transmogrification

Range: self Duration: 12 turns

On casting this spell, a *sword of fire* appears in the caster’s hand. The sword can be used in melee like any ordinary sword, but it grants a +3 bonus to attack throws and deals 1d6+3 extraordinary luminous fire damage. If the caster is 12th caster level or higher, the bonus to attack throws and damage is increased to +4. The *sword of fire* can be dual-wielded with another weapon (even another *sword of fire*) or used with a shield, but cannot be wielded two-handed. The spell does not grant the caster any weapon or fighting style proficiencies, however. The caster can cause the sword to appear and disappear at will without taking an action, enabling him to cast spells and carry out other activities.

###### Telekinesis

Arcane 5 Type: movement

Range: 180’ Duration: 1 turn per level

This spell can enable the caster to move a target creature or object of up to a specified weight in any direction through the air within range. (If the caster is the recipient, the range is measured from his location when he casts the spell.) The caster can telekinetically move up to 6 stone per caster level.

If the caster targets a willing recipient, an unattended object, or an object possessed by a willing creature, the spell automatically moves the target. If the caster targets an unwilling creature, or an object possessed by an unwilling creature, the creature must make a Spells saving throw. If the save fails, the target can be moved. If the save succeeds, the target cannot be moved this round, but the caster can try again on the same or another target on his next initiative.

To move the affected creature or object, the caster must concentrate. The concentrating caster can move the affected creature up to 20’ in any direction each round on the caster’s initiative, including on the round he cast the spell. The caster does not need to maintain concentration to sustain the spell. For instance, he can concentrate for one round to move the recipient 20’ up, take another action the following round, and then resume moving the recipient the subsequent round. The caster can change the target of *telekinesis* on each round that he concentrates, if desired. However, if he stops moving an unwilling creature, then wants to move the creature again later, the creature receives a new saving throw to resist being moved.

If the affected creature or object is up in the air, and either the duration expires, the spell is **dispelled**, the affected creature or object is loaded beyond what the caster can telekinetically support, or the caster begins concentrating on a new target, the affected creature or objectwill immediately plummet from the air.

###### Telepathy

Arcane 4 Type: detection, esoteric

Range: 180’ Duration: 1 turn

This spell can enable the spellcaster to engage in direct mind-to-mind communication with other sapient creatures without need for a shared language. When the spell is cast, the caster can request a telepathic link with a target sapient creature. The target “feels” its mind being “touched.” The target can either accept the telepathic link or attempt to refuse it. If the target accepts the link, it is automatically established. If the target attempts to refuse the link, it must make a Spells saving throw. If the save fails, the link is established despite its refusal. If the save succeeds, the link is not established.

Once the link is established, the caster can read all of the target’s surface thoughts and can send thoughts of his own to the target. Note that this is asymmetrical: the caster can read what target is thinking, even if the target doesn’t want him to, while target can only read what the caster chooses to send.

Since telepathy only allows the caster to read the target’s surface thoughts, the target’s deeply held secrets, private concerns, or suppressed memories cannot usually be accessed with telepathy unless they are somehow brought to the surface of the target’s mind. A clever caster might transmit cues, reminders, or triggers to try to bring certain thoughts to the surface, or might even have a nearby accomplice provoke the target to expose what it thinks. Such shenanigans are left to the Judge’s discretion to decide.

The caster must maintain stationary concentration to keep a telepathic link active. The caster does not need to maintain concentration to sustain the spell. For instance, he can concentrate for one round to communicate with a target, take another action the following round, and then establish a new link with that or another target on the subsequent round. The caster can change the creature with which he is linked each round that he concentrates, if desired. However, if the caster breaks his telepathic link with an unwilling creature, then wants to link with that creature again later, the creature receives a new saving throw to resist the link.

###### Teleportation

Arcane 5 Type: movement

Range: touch Duration: instantaneous

This spell instantly teleports a target creature, along with whatever it is carrying or wearing, to a destination of the caster’s choice. If the target is willing, it is automatically teleported when touched. If the target is unwilling, it must make a Spells saving throw when touched. If the save fails, the target is teleported. If the save succeeds, the target resists being teleported.

*Teleportation* is notoriously inaccurate and dangerous, and only the desperate or reckless use it often. The chance of the spell working correctly depends on how familiar the caster is with the intended destination. The more familiar the caster, the better the chance of the spell working correctly. For purposes of the spell, there are four degrees of familiarity. The caster is considered **intimately familiar** with places he has regularly inhabited for many years, such as his own residence or his childhood home. The caster is considered **familiar** with places he can currently see or places he has visited repeatedly in recent memory, such as a favorite tavern or place of worship. The caster is considered **somewhat familiar** with places he has personally visited at least twice or scried on for at least an hour. The caster is considered **vaguely familiar** with places he has personally visited just once, has briefly scried, or has only seen rendered in art or by illusion.

To determine how well the teleportation works, roll d% and consult the table below.

Caster Familiarity On Target Off Target Lost

Intimately Familiar 01 – 95 96 – 99 00

Familiar 01 – 80 81 – 90 91 – 00

Somewhat Familiar 01 – 50 51 – 75 76 – 00

Vaguely Familiar 01 – 30 31 – 65 66 – 00

If the result is **On Target**, the teleported creature arrives at the intended destination at ground level in a suitable and open point. If the result is **Off Target**, the teleported creature arrives 1d10 x 10 feet away from the intended destination in a random direction. If this location already be occupied by solid matter, the creature is instantly killed; if this location is above the ground, the creature immediately plummets to earth. If the result is **Lost**, the teleported creature does not arrive at all. Whether such hapless creatures are **disintegrated**, trapped forever in some other sphere of existence, or transported to some distant time and place is a matter of debate among the wise. Under no circumstances can a caster intentionally teleport himself or another creature off target, into thin air, or into solid matter.

###### Thunderbolt

Arcane 3 Type: blast, elemental (air)

Range: 0’ Duration: instantaneous

The caster releases a thunderous blast of electricity that extends 120’ from his outstretched hands. The *thunderbolt* passes through an area 5’ wide, arcing and jumping, so that, while it is not actually 5’ wide, for game purposes treat it as if it is so. Each creature in the area of effect must make a Blast saving throw. If the save fails, the creature suffers 1d6 points of extraordinary electricity damage per caster level and is **deafened** by shock and thunder. If the save succeeds, the creature suffers half that damage but is not deafened.

A deafened creature is easy to sneak up on, and suffers a -2 penalty to surprise rolls. It can be backstabbed by an opponent outside its line of sight as if the creature were **sneaking**. Due to its inability to hear itself, a deafened creature has a -4 penalty on any throws that require vocalization (such as using Magical Music proficiency). The deafened creature can make another saving throw at the end of its initiative each round. If the save succeeds, it is no longer deafened.

The *thunderbolt*can also damage structures in its area of effect. It deals up to 1d6 extraordinary electrical structural damage per caster level to wooden structures and one-third that damage to stone structures. (It might deal less if the structure is not entirely in its area of effect.) If the damage caused to an interposing structure shatters or breaks through it, the bolt may continue beyond the barrier if the spell’s range permits; otherwise, it may reflect from the barrier back towards the caster, or in a random direction at the Judge’s option. Creatures already affected by the *thunderbolt* do not take additional damage if struck by the reflection of the same bolt. A *thunderbolt*is so loud that it can be heard as a low rumble by creatures up to 10 miles away.

###### Thunderclap

Arcane 1 Type: blast, elemental (air)

Range: 90’ Duration: instantaneous

A deafening peal of thunder resounds at a point of the caster’s choice. The *thunderclap* is so loud that it can be heard as a low rumble by creatures up to 10 miles away. Each creature within 5’ of the *thunderclap* must make Blast saving throw. If the save fails, the creature suffers 1d6 extraordinary bludgeoning damage and is **deafened**. If the save succeeds, the creature suffers half that damage but is not deafened (though its ears may ache and ring).

A deafened creature is easy to sneak up on, and suffers a -2 penalty to surprise rolls. It can be backstabbed by an opponent outside its line of sight as if the creature were **sneaking**. Due to its inability to hear itself, a deafened creature has a -4 penalty on any throws that require vocalization (such as a using Magical Music proficiency). The deafened creature can make another saving throw at the end of its initiative each round. If the save succeeds, it is no longer deafened.

###### Tongues\*

Divine 4 Type: detection, esoteric

Range: 90’ Duration: 1 turn

This spell grants the caster the ability to speak and understand the language of any intelligent creature within range.

The reverse, *garble*, can be cast on an intelligent living target within range. No saving throw is permitted. If the target is the beneficiary of a *tongues*spell, *garble*will negate the *tongues*spell; otherwise, *garble*will render the target unable to speak and understand the languages of other intelligent creatures. While unable to communicate with others, the target may still think clearly and understand his own words, so *garble*does not prevent the target from casting spells. Indeed, the target may not immediately realize he is under the effects of a *garble*– he may think something is wrong with the creatures around him who can’t understand what he’s saying.

###### Torpor

Arcane 6, Divine 6 Type: esoteric, necromancy

Range: touch Duration: indefinite

The caster puts an undead target into a pseudo-sleep of indefinite duration. In order to be placed into *torpor*, the creature must be in its tomb, coffin, sarcophagus, ossuary, or other final resting place. If the target creature is a willing recipient, the torpor automatically occurs when the creature is touched. If the creature is an unwilling target, it must make a Death saving throw when it is touched, and only enters *torpor* on a failure.

While in *torpor*, undead creature such as zombies, mummies, and liches do not suffer physical decay, while hungering undead such as ghouls or vampires do not need to feed. An undead is awakened from *torpor* if its final resting place is disturbed. The caster can set other conditions; a common condition is a particular alignment of the stars or outer planes. An awakened undead may choose to return to *torpor* if it resolves the reason for its awakening within one hour (6 turns) or it may remain awake.

###### Transform Beast

Divine 2 Type: transmogrification

Range: 90’ Duration: perpetual

This spell allows the caster to change a target animal into the form of another animal that is native to his location. The target’s current form cannot be incorporeal, gaseous, or larger than man-sized. If the target animal is a willing recipient, the transformation automatically occurs when the spell is cast. If the animal is an unwilling target, it must make a Spells saving throw when the spell is cast. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect. If the save fails, the creature is transformed.

Most animals will be unwilling to be transformed, but if the animal is **bewitched** by the caster, has been befriended by the caster using Beast Friendship or *speak with beasts*, or was personally raised and trained by the caster, the animal will trust the caster enough to count as a willing recipient.

While transformed, the animal gains the physical attributes, capabilities, and attacks of the new form, along with the new form’s mental characteristics, intelligence, behavioral traits, and mentality. The target creature will have the same number of hit points it previously had, regardless of the Hit Dice of the form assumed. The new form will always be of around the same relative age as the original form; a bear cub can be transformed into a wolf puppy or tadpole, but not into a silverback gorilla. The target animal is sterile in its new form and cannot reproduce offspring.

The target animal will but dimly remember its former life, and loses any training it has received, although it remains tame if it was previously and can be re-trained. Unless persuaded otherwise by, e.g. a character with Beast Friendship or *speak with beasts***,** it will simply engage in behavior that is ordinary for its kind for the duration of the spell. The spell is perpetual, lasting until dispelled or the creature is slain or until the caster dies or decides to stop sustaining the spell. When the spell expires, the target (or target’s corpse) reverts to its original form.

Because the form must be native to the caster’s location, the caster cannot transform a rabbit into a dinosaur unless in a “lost world” where such creatures still roam the earth. Likewise, the caster cannot transform a camel into a whale in the middle of the desert, or a polar bear into a lion in the middle of the tundra.

###### Transform Other

Arcane 6 Type: transmogrification

Range: touch Duration: perpetual

This spell allows the caster to change a living target into another form of living creature. The target’s current form cannot be incorporeal, gaseous, or larger than man-sized. The target’s new form can’t have more Hit Dice than caster’s level, must have fewer than twice the Hit Dice of the target’s old form, and cannot have more than one special ability (\*). The target cannot be changed into an incorporeal or gaseous form**,** nor into the form of an enchanted creature. The spell cannot create a duplicate of a specific individual.

If the target creature is a willing recipient, the transformation automatically occurs when the creature is touched. If the creature is an unwilling target, it must make a Spells saving throw when it is touched. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect. If the save fails, the creature is transformed.

While transformed, the target gains the physical capabilities and characteristics, physical attacks, and special abilities of the new form while retaining his own mental abilities (perhaps to his horror). The target creature will have the same number of hit points it previously had, regardless of the Hit Dice of the form assumed. The target creature is sterile in its new form and cannot reproduce offspring. The new form will always be of around the same relative age as the original form.

Creatures with shape changing abilities such as a doppelganger or powerful shaman can revert to their natural form in one round. Otherwise, the spell is perpetual, lasting until dispelled or the creature is slain or until the caster dies or decides to stop sustaining the spell. When the spell expires, the target (or target’s corpse) reverts to its original form.

###### Transform Self

Arcane 6 Type: transmogrification

Range: self Duration: 6 turns + 1 turn/caster level

This spell allows the caster to change into another form of living creature. The assumed form cannot have more Hit Dice than caster level and cannot have more than one special ability (\*). The caster cannot assume an incorporeal or gaseous form, or the form of an enchanted creature, and cannot become a duplicate of a specific individual. If slain, the caster reverts to his original form. The caster must be man-sized or smaller when she casts this spell or it fails to work.

While transformed, the caster gains the physical capabilities and characteristics of the new form while retaining his own mental abilities. He also gains all physical attacks and special abilities possessed by the new form. The caster will have the same number of hit points he previously had, regardless of the Hit Dice of the form assumed. The caster is sterile in his new form and cannot reproduce offspring. The new form will always be of around the same relative age as the original form. The caster can remain transformed for the full duration of the spell, or may choose to end the spell whenever he desires.

###### Trollblood

Arcane 6 Type: transmogrification

Range: self Duration: 1 turn

This spell grants the caster regenerative powers similar to those of a troll. For the duration of the spell, the caster will regenerate 3 damage at the start of his initiative. Even if the caster is reduced below 0 hit points, he will continue to regenerate, and he will be have no need for bed rest if he regenerates to 1 or more hp before the spell expires. If the caster loses a limb or body part to a mortal wound, these parts will attempt to crawl or squirm back towards the main portion of his body to reattach, and can be reattached instantly simply by being held to the stump.

However, only damage taken while under the effect of the spell can be regenerated. The caster does notregenerate from the effects of damage or mortal wounds suffered before the spell was cast. Further, the spell is powerless to regenerate fire damage or acid damage.

The caster must be man-sized or smaller when he casts this spell or it fails to work.

###### True Seeing

Divine 5 Type: detection, esoteric

Range: touch Duration: 1 turn + 1 round/caster level

This spell confers the recipient with the ability to see the world clearly and without obfuscation. The recipient can see through normal and magical darkness, notices any and all secret doors, sees the exact locations of displaced creatures or objects, sees through normal or magical disguises, sees invisible creatures or objects normally, sees through illusions, and sees the true form of transformed creatures or objects, out to a range of 120’.

*True seeing*, however, does not penetrate solid objects. It in no way confers *x***-***ray**vision* or its equivalent. It does not negate concealment, including that caused by fog, rain, or snow. In addition, the spell’s effects cannot be further enhanced with known magic, so the recipient cannot use *true**seeing* through a **crystal ball** or in conjunction with *clairvoyancy*.

###### Turn to Dust

Divine 5 Type: death

Range: 225’Duration: instantaneous

This spell can turn an undead target into dust. The target of the spell must make a Death saving throw. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect. If the save fails, the target is instantly destroyed. Even creatures such as vampires can be destroyed with this powerful spell. *Turn to dust*has no effect on living creatures, constructs, or incarnations.

###### Unliving Puppet

Arcane 1 , Divine 1 Type: necromancy

Range: 90’Duration: concentration

This spell raises the bones or body of a single dead creature within range and line of sight of the caster as an undead skeleton or zombie under the caster’s mental control. An animated skeleton can be created only from a mostly intact skeleton; a zombie can be created only from a mostly intact corpse.

Animated skeletons have Hit Dice equal to the default number of racial Hit Dice such monsters have in life; for skeletons of humans or demi-humans, this means one Hit Die, regardless of the character level of the deceased. Zombies have one more Hit Die than the monsters have in life. Unlike *animate undead*, the HD of the skeleton or zombie created are not limited by caster level. However, only creatures of less than 9 HD can be raised by this spell (though an 8 HD creature might be raised as a 9 HD zombie).

The caster must concentrate to control the *unliving puppet*.The undead cannot be controlled outside the range of the spell. If the caster loses concentration, or the unliving puppet is somehow forced out of range of the caster, the spell ends. Otherwise the *unliving**puppet*remains animated until destroyed or **dispelled**, or until the caster relinquishes concentration. The creatures’ remains crumble to dust when the spell ends.

###### Vigor

Divine 5 Type: transmogrification

Range: touchDuration: 1 turn / caster level

This spell imbues the recipient with divine might and potency. For the duration of the spell, the character gains an additional +2 bonus to attack throws and damage rolls, an additional +8 bonus on Dungeonbashing throws, a +2 bonus to saving throws, and 1d10 temporary hit points. The temporary hit points cannot be restored by healing and are the first lost whenever the character takes damage. The recipient must be man-sized or smaller when this spell is cast or it fails to work. This spell does not otherwise stack with effects that influence strength, but it does stack with the character’s normal bonus or penalty from Strength and with effects that alter size.

###### Vitriolic Infusion

Arcane 2 Type: elemental (water), transmogrification

Range: touch Duration: 1 day

This spell infuses water with concentrated vitriol, transforming it into a highly-damaging *vitriolic infusion*. A single casting will transform six flasks of water. When a flask of *vitriolic**infusion* is thrown, resolve the effects as if it were a flask of burning oil (see p. XX) but dealing acidic rather than fire damage. The magical *infusion* will evaporate in one day if unused. The spell has no effect on creatures of any type, nor upon magic potions, oil, or holy water.

###### Wall of Annihilation

Arcane 6 Type: wall

Range: 180’Duration: perpetual

This spell conjures an invisible *wall**of**annihilation* into existence. Any creature or object that passes through the *wall**of**annihilation* is instantly **disintegrated** with no saving throw. Only a *miracle*or *wish*can restore the victim to life.

The wall is 1’ thick and can be as large as 100 square feet. It must be a flat vertical plane in contact with the ground and bonded to the surrounding material. The caster cannot evoke the wall such that it appears on or on top of creatures or objects. Walls of annihilation are most commonly placed as invisible traps that secure doorways or entrances within a mage’s sanctum.

The *wall of annihilation* is unaffected by normal or magical attacks and invulnerable to physical and magical damage. However, it can be **dispelled**normally, and a *disintegration*spell will destroy it. If not **dispelled** or destroyed, the wall of annihilation is perpetual, lasting until the caster dies or decides to stop sustaining it.

###### Wall of Corpses

Arcane 6 Type: necromancy, wall

Range: 180’Duration: 2 turns

This spell conjures a horrific barrier formed of writhing, animated corpses into existence for the duration of the spell. The *wall of corpses* is 1’ thick and can be as large as 1,200 square feet. It can be shaped in any manner and to any dimensions the caster desires provided the entire wall is within the spell’s range. For instance, it might be a straight wall 120’ long and 10’ high, or a protective circle 10’ high with a 10’ radius. The *wall**of**corpses*cannot be evoked so that it appears where objects or creatures already are.

Upon beholdinga *wall**of**corpses*, creatures must make a Paralysis saving throw. If the saving throw succeeds, the creature is immune to the effects of beholding the *wall.*  If the saving throw fails, the creature begins **faltering.** The condition lasts until the wall is **dispelled** or until the creature no longer beholds the wall. If the creature beholds the wall again, it must save again if not already immune. Any creatures starting their initiative or moving to within 5’ of the wall are attacked as if from a readied attack by a zombie (see the ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual***).

A *counterspell*, *dispel magic,*or a *disintegration*spell can destroy a *wall**of**corpses*immediately. A *wall**of**corpses* can also be damaged by normal or magical attacks dealing damage of any type except necrotic. The wall has AC 4 and 10 hp per caster level, and saves as a fighter of caster level. A crusader or other character capable of turning undead can attempt to turn the wall as if it were an Infernal creature. If the turning throw succeeds, the corpses within lose their animating force, rendering the wall merely an inert, fleshy barrier for the duration of the turning. If the turning throw succeeds with a D (destroyed) result, the wall is instantly destroyed. If not otherwise destroyed or **dispelled**, the wall vanishes in 2 turns.

###### Wall of Flame

Arcane 4 Type: elemental (fire), wall

Range: 180’Duration: 2 turns

This spell conjures an immobile, translucent, *wall of flame* into existence for the duration of the spell. The wall is 1’ thick and can be as large as 1,200 square feet. The caster can form the wall into almost any shape he desires, provided the entire wall is within the spell’s range and it rests on a solid surface. For instance, it might be a straight wall 120’ long and 10’ high, or a protective circle 10’ high with a 10’ radius. However, the caster cannot evoke the wall such that it appears on or on top of creatures or objects. The wall does not block light, movement, or vision. However, any creature passing through the wall suffers 2d6 extraordinary fire damage. A *counterspell*, *disintegration,*or *dispel magic*spell can destroy the *wall of flame*instantly; it will otherwise dissipate in 2 turns.

###### Wall of Force

Arcane 6 Type: wall

Range: 180’Duration: 2 turns

This spell conjures an invisible, impenetrable *wall of force* into existence for the duration of the spell. The wall is 1’ thick and can be as large as 1,200 square feet.

For instance, it might be a straight wall 120’ long and 10’ high, or a protective circle 10’ high with a 10’ radius. However, the caster cannot evoke the wall such that it appears on or on top of creatures or objects. The *wall of force*is totally impenetrable, and is unaffected by normal or magical attacks, fire, cold, lightning, or any other physical or magical effect. A *counterspell* or *dispel magic* will not affect it, but a *disintegration*spell will destroy it.

Range: 180’Duration: 2 turns

This spell conjures an immobile, translucent, *wall of frost* into existence for the duration of the spell. The wall is 1’ thick and can be as large as 1,200 square feet. The caster can form the wall into almost any shape he desires, provided the entire wall is within the spell’s range and it rests on a solid surface. For instance, it might be a straight wall 120’ long and 10’ high, or a protective circle 10’ high with a 10’ radius. However, the caster cannot evoke the wall such that it appears on or on top of creatures or objects. The wall does not block light, movement, or vision. However, any creature passing through the wall suffers 2d6 extraordinary cold damage. A *counterspell*, *disintegration,*or *dispel**magic* spell can destroy the *wall of frost*instantly; it will otherwise dissipate in 2 turns.

###### Wall of Smoke

Arcane 1 Type: elemental (air), wall

Range: 180’Duration: 1 turn

This spell conjures an immobile, opaque, wall of billowing smoke into existence for the duration of the spell. The wall is normally 1’ thick and can be as large as 1,000 square feet. The wall can be made thicker than 1’ with a proportionate reduction in area, but it cannot be made less than 1’ thick. The caster can form the wall into almost any shape he desires, provided the entire wall is within the spell’s range. However, the caster cannot evoke the wall such that it appears on or on top of creatures or objects.

The *wall of smoke* is impermeable to vision and light, but presents no obstacle to movement or magical effects except for those requiring a line of sight to target. Once created, the *wall of smoke*can be affected by water or strong winds like an ordinary cloud of smoke, though other attacks will have correspondingly little effect on it. A *counterspell, disintegration,*or *dispel magic*spell can destroy the *wall of smoke*instantly; it will otherwise dissipate in 1 turn.

###### Wall of Stone

Arcane 5 Type: elemental (earth), wall

Range: 180’Duration: perpetual

This spell conjures a stone wall into existence. The wall is normally 1’ thick and can be as large as 1,000 square feet. The wall can be made thicker than 1’ with a proportionate reduction in area, but cannot be made less than 1’ thick. The caster can form the wall into almost any dimensions and shape he desires provided the entire wall is within the spell’s range. However, the caster cannot evoke the wall such that it appears on or on top of creatures or objects. The wall created need not be vertical, nor rest upon any firm foundation; however, it must merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. It can be used to bridge a chasm, for instance, or as a ramp. For this use, if the span is more than 20’, the wall must be arched and buttressed. This requirement reduces the spell’s area by half. The wall can be crudely shaped to allow crenellations, battlements, and so forth by likewise reducing the area. The wall is perpetual, lasting until destroyed, **disintegrated**, or **dispelled**, or until the caster dies or decides to stop sustaining the spell.

###### Wall of Thunder

Arcane 3 Type: elemental (air), wall

Range: 120’Duration: concentration

This spell conjures a wall of thunderous lightning and violent winds. The *wall of thunder* is 1’ thick and can be as large as 500 square feet. It can be almost any shape the caster desires, provided the entire wall is within the spell’s range and the bottom of the wall is in contact with the ground. The caster cannot evoke the wall that it appears on or on top of creatures or objects.

Any creatures that start their initiative or move within 5’ of the wall are subject to attack as if from a readied 2 HD monster. If the attack hits, the creature suffers 1d6 extraordinary electric damage. Any creature passing through the wall automatically suffers 2d6 extraordinary electric damage.

The wall does not block light, movement, or vision. It cannot be affected by physical or magical attacks and is invulnerable to physical and magical damage. If not destroyed, **dispelled**, or **disintegrated**, the *wall* remains so long as the caster maintain concentration on it. The concentrating caster can move the wall along the ground up to 20’ in any desired direction in range on his initiative each round.

Because *wall of thunder* draws its power from atmospheric winds, it can only be cast outdoors or in a well-ventilated room. It is primarily used during battles. An 8.25’ tall, 60’ wide *wall of thunder* can badly injure an entire company of troops by moving through them.

###### Wall of Wood

Arcane 4 Type: elemental (earth), wall

Range: 180’Duration: perpetual

This spell conjures a wooden wall into existence. The wall is normally 1” thick and can be as large as 1,200 square feet. The wall can be made thicker than 1” with a proportionate reduction in area, but cannot be made less than 1” thick. The caster can create a *wall**of**wood* in almost any shape he desires provided the entire wall is within the spell’s range. However, the caster cannot evoke the wall such that it appears on or on top of creatures or objects. The wall created need not be vertical, but must rest upon a firm foundation. It can be used to bridge a chasm, for instance, or as a ramp, but the wall must be shaped properly, reducing the spell’s area by half. Likewise, the wall can be crudely shaped to form battlements and ramparts by reducing the area. The wall is perpetual, lasting until destroyed, **disintegrated**, or **dispelled**, or until the caster dies or decides to stop sustaining the spell.

###### Warp Wood

Arcane 2 Type: blast, elemental (earth)

Range: 360’ Duration: instantaneous

This spell causes every small wooden object within a 20’ diameter sphere to be bent into a clumsy, twisted, uneven shape. It can affect arrows, bows, clubs, shields, spears, staffs, wands, and other non-structural wooden object weighing 1 stone or less, but not wooden creatures, doors, vessels, vehicles, or structures. Non-magical wooden objects are automatically warped to the point of uselessness. Magical wooden objects might resist the effect. If the object is held by a creature, the creature can make a Death saving throw, adding the weapon’s magic bonus (if any) to the save. If the object is not being held by a creature, the object must make a Death saving throw as a fighter of a level equal to its magic bonus. (Count staffs and wands as having a bonus equal to one-half their caster level.) If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect. If the save fails, the object is ruined. The spell causes no harm to the creature holding the weapon (except for depriving him of it).

###### Water Breathing

Arcane 3, Divine 3 Type: elemental (water), transmogrification

Range: 45’Duration: 1 day

This spell allows the recipient to breathe underwater at any depth. It does not prevent the recipient from breathing air, nor does it provide any special ability to move underwater. The recipient must be man-sized or smaller when the spell is cast or it fails to work.

###### Water Walking

Divine 3 Type: elemental (water), movement

Range: 45’Duration: 6 turns + 1 turn/caster level

This spell allows the recipient to walk on water as if it were solid, dry land. While walking on water, the recipient can still attack creatures in or beneath the surface of the water, but cannot swim or submerge itself without ending the spell effect. The caster must be man-sized or smaller when the spell is cast or it fails to work.

###### Weave Fire

Arcane 3 Type: elemental (fire), wall

Range: 180’Duration: 2 turns

This spell allows the caster to manipulate an existing volume of fire into a different shape. In order to weave fire the caster must concentrate. The concentrating caster can move up to 1,000 cubic feet of fire by up to 100’ each combat round. The caster does not need to maintain concentration to sustain the spell. For instance, he can concentrate for one round to weave fire, take another action the following round, and then resume weaving fire subsequent round.

The caster cannot weave fire carried or held by creatures or in which there are creatures already, nor can he weave it to impact creatures. He cannot affect a carried torch, for instance, nor can he weave fire straight into an enemy. In addition, the fire cannot be woven to be less than 1” thick and it must eventually merge with the fire’s kindling source. Subject to those limitations, the caster can weave the fire into almost any shape he desires. If the caster has a relevant Art or Craft proficiency, he can even weave the fire into fiery sculptures with intricate detail. When the spell expires, the fire sputters out wherever there is not appropriate fuel, and thereafter burns as a natural fire.

If woven to at least 6” thickness, woven fire will block vision, and if woven to 1’ thickness, it will block both vision and light. Due to the enchantments placed up on it, the woven fire is impenetrable to monsters with fewer than 5 HD. Monsters with 5 or more HD suffer 1d6 extraordinary fire damage if they pass through the fire. *Weave fire*does not create the fire itself, so it must be cast on a bonfire, forest fire, etc.

###### Weave Smoke

Arcane 1 Type: elemental (air), wall

Range: 180’Duration: 2 turns

This spell allows the caster to manipulate an existing volume of fog and/or smoke into a different shape. In order to weave smoke the caster must concentrate. The concentrating caster can move up to 1,000 cubic feet of smoke by up to 100’ each combat round. The caster does not need to maintain concentration to sustain the spell. For instance, he can concentrate for one round to weave smoke, take another action the following round, and then resume weaving fire subsequent round.

The caster cannot weave the smoke so that it appears where objects or creatures already are, nor can he weave it to impact creatures. In addition, the smoke cannot be woven to be less than 1” thick. Subject to those limitations, the caster can weave the smoke into almost any shape he desires. If the caster has a relevant Art or Craft proficiency, he can even weave the smoke into decorative sculptures with intricate detail. If woven to at least 6” thickness, woven smoke will block vision, and if woven to 1’ thickness, it will block both vision and light. Smoke never presents an obstacle to movement or magical effects (except for those requiring a line of sight to target, of course). Once woven, the smoke can still be affected by water or strong winds like an ordinary cloud of smoke, though other attacks will have correspondingly little effect on it. A *counterspell*, *disintegration,*or *dispel magic* spell can disperse the woven smoke instantly; it will otherwise dissipate in 1 turn. The spell does not create the smoke itself, so it must be cast on morning mist, banks of fog, smoke from a fire, etc.

###### Weave Water

Arcane 4 Type: elemental (water), wall

Range: 180’Duration: 2 turns

This spell allows the caster to manipulate an existing volume of water into a different shape. In order to weave fire the caster must concentrate. The concentrating caster can move up to 1,200 cubic feet of water by up to 120’ each combat round. The caster does not need to maintain concentration to sustain the spell. For instance, he can concentrate for one round to weave water, take another action the following round, and then resume weaving water subsequent round.

The caster cannot weave water carried or held by creatures or in which there are creatures already, nor can he weave it to impact creatures. In addition, the water cannot be woven to be less than 1” thick and it must eventually merge with the existing water source. Subject to those limitations, the caster can weave the water into almost any shape he desires. If the caster has a relevant Art or Craft proficiency, he can even weave the water into flowing sculptures with intricate detail. When the spell expires, the weaving collapses spectacularly and the water returns to its natural shape.

If woven to at least 6” thickness, woven water will block vision, and if woven to 1’ thickness, it will block both vision and light. Due to the enchantments placed up on it, the woven water is impenetrable to monsters with fewer than 5 HD. Monsters with 5 or more HD suffer 1d6 extraordinary cold damage if they pass through the water. *Weave water*does not create the water itself, so it must be cast on a fountain, lake, river, etc.

###### Webbing

Arcane 2 Type: esoteric, wall

Range: 10’Duration: 48 turns

This spell creates a many-layered mass of strong, sticky strands covering an area 10’ x 10’ x 10’. Creatures caught within the *webbing* when it appears become **webbed** by the gluey fibers. Creatures that attack targets in the *webbing* with weapons do not become restrained, but creatures that attack targets in the *webbing* with natural weapons or that move into the *webbing* do. Incorporeal creatures can ignore the *webbing* as if it were not there.

Webbed creatures cannot move, but can still attack, cast spells, take actions in lieu of attacking or moving, or attempt to escape. While webbed, the is **vulnerable** and can be ambushed or backstabbed by creatures capable of doing so.

Attempting to escape from the webbing is an action in lieu of attacking. The creature can attempt to slip free or break free. Slipping free requires a Paralysis saving throw. If the creature has Contortionism proficiency, it gains a +4 bonus on the throw. If the save succeeds, the creature escapes. If the save fails, the creature gets more entangled in the webs and becomes **helpless**.

Breaking free requires a Dungeonbashing proficiency throw at -9. If the throw succeeds, the creature escapes. If the throw fails, the creature remains webbed (but does not become helpless). Large creatures gain a +4 bonus, huge creatures gain a +8 bonus, gigantic creatures gain a +12 bonus, and colossal creatures gain a +16 bonus on the throw.

Webbed creatures can free themselves, and webbed creatures can be freed, by cutting the webbing or setting it aflame. Cutting webbing off a creature is an attack and requires a successful attack throw vs. AC 4 with a weapon dealing extraordinary slashing damage. If the attack throw succeeds, the creature is no longer webbed. Setting fire to the webbing is an attack and requires an attack throw against AC 0 with the fire source. If the attack succeeds, the webs instantly go up in flames. All creatures in the webbing immediately take 1d8 mundane fire damage at the start of their initiative until they escape the webbing. The webbing burns away at the end of two rounds.

###### Winged Flight

Divine 3 Type: transmogrification

Range: selfDuration: 1 turn per level

This spell endows the caster with a pair of majestic wings on his shoulders. The caster’s alignment, deity and spell signature determine the appearance of the wings (e.g. bat wings, butterfly wings, eagle wings, etc.). The wings permit the caster to fly in any direction with a combat speed of 120’ per round, and an encounter speed of 360’ per turn. The speed is reduced by encumbrance, however, and the caster of *winged**flight*cannot carry aloft more weight than his maximum load. *Winged**flight*requires only as much concentration as walking, so the caster can act normally. If *winged flight* is **dispelled** or the duration expires while the caster is flying, the caster will plummet from the air. The caster must be man-sized or smaller when she casts this spell or it fails to work.

###### Word of Command

Divine 1 Type: enchantment

Range: 15’ Duration: 1 round

This spell empowers the caster to give a living target a one word command. The command given must be a single verb in the imperative case, such as “approach,” “die,” “drop,” “flee,” “halt,” ”submit,” “surrender,” or “sleep.” The target must be able to hear and understand the word spoken.

When the command is uttered, the target must make a Spells saving throw. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect. If the save fails, the target is immediately affected by one or more conditions. On its next initiative, it follows the command given. All of the conditions except prone expires at the start of the target’s subsequent initiative. The prone condition ends when the target uses an action to get up.

* *Approach:* The target immediately becomes **enthralled**. On its initiative, it advances at combat speed towards the caster.
* *Die:* The target immediatelyfalls **prone** and becomes **unconscious**. On its initiative, it takes no action.
* *Drop:* The target immediately starts **faltering**. On its initiative, itdrops any items it is carrying in its hands or on its back.
* *Flee:* The target immediately becomes **frightened**. On its initiative, it flees at its running speed away from the caster.
* *Halt:* The target becomes **mesmerized**. On its initiative, it takes no action.
* *Submit:* The target immediately starts **faltering**. On its initiative, it sheathes any weapon it was carrying and prostates itself before the caster, becoming **prone**.
* *Surrender:* The target immediately starts **faltering**. On its initiative, it drops any weapons it is carrying (but not other objects) and raises its hands above its head.
* Sleep: The target immediately faints, falls **prone** and starts **slumbering**. On its initiative, it takes no action.

This list is exemplary rather than exclusive, and the Judge should be prepared to adjudicate other possible *words of command* based on these guidelines.

###### X-Ray Vision

Arcane 5 Type: detection, esoteric

Range: self Duration: concentration

The spell grants the caster the ability to see through most living and nonliving materials. Using *x-ray vision* requires concentration. In each turn (10 minutes), the caster can closely investigate a 10’ x 10’ x 10’ zone, automatically discovering the contents of chests, the location of secret doors or traps, or other hidden objects in the zone. The caster must be in or adjacent to the zone to use x-ray vision. *X-ray vision* can penetrate flesh, stone, earth, or wood within the zone, but not bone or metal; even a thin layer of lead blocks it.
