## Gaining Proficiencies

All characters may choose one additional proficiency from the general list at levels 5, 9, and (if maximum level permits) 13. Characters may choose one additional proficiency from their class list each time they complete a full (two point) saving throw progression. This is summarized on the Proficiencies Gained per Level table. Levels exceeding a class’s maximum level are marked with a “-“.

Unless its description says otherwise, a proficiency may only be selected once. If a general proficiency can be selected more than once, then the target value required for success is reduced by 4 each time the proficiency is selected. Some proficiencies may offer additional benefits if taken multiple times. Unless otherwise noted, all proficiency throws use 1d20.

The Judge may impose limitations on the selection of certain proficiencies depending on his campaign or setting. Otherwise, characters may take any proficiency on the appropriate list.

###### Gaining Proficiencies by Time and Training (Optional)

In addition to their starting and level-based proficiencies, all characters have four “implicit” general proficiency slots which represent their potential for natural accretion of knowledge over time. Characters who are not exceptionally diligent at practice automatically fill these slots after 5, 15, 35, and 70 years of work. This is how 0th level NPCs gain proficiencies without adventuring. In normal circumstances of play, these proficiencies are irrelevant to adventurers.

As an optional rule, however, the Judge can permit adventurers to accelerate their acquisition of these proficiency slots by deliberately training:

* 60 days (2 months) of dedicated activity of training grants the first rank of one general proficiency.
* 240 days (8 months) of dedicated activity of training grants the second rank or the first rank of a second proficiency.
* 540 days (18 months) of dedicated activity of training grants the third rank or the first rank of a third proficiency.
* 960 days (32 months) of dedicated activity to training grants the fourth rank or the first rank of a fourth proficiency.

The adventurer must have access to either a tutor who knows the proficiency or to a treatise equal to the rank he is training. No more than four general proficiencies can be acquired from training.

###### Retraining Proficiencies (Optional)

Sometimes a character may choose a proficiency that was useful at a certain stage in his career, but which is no longer necessary as he advances in power. As an optional rule, the Judge can permit adventurers to retrain an existing class or general proficiency for another proficiency of the same type. Retraining a proficiency requires 120 days of downtime, during which time the character must have access to either a tutor who knows the proficiency or to a treatise. A character can re-retrain back into a proficiency he previously knew with 60 days of downtime without need for a tutor or manual. The following proficiencies cannot be retrained: Beast Friendship, Divine Blessing, Divine Health, Elven Bloodline, Illusion Resistance, Laying on Hands, Prophecy, Soothsaying.

###### Proficiencies of Normal Humans and Demi-Humans

Normal humans and demi-humans (non-adventuring 0th level characters) begin their careers with four general proficiencies. (In rare cases, 0th level characters might have class proficiencies.) If their Intellect is 13 or greater, they gain additional general proficiencies equal to their Intellect bonus. A character cannot select the same proficiency more than once with his four starting proficiencies, but can use bonus proficiencies from high INT to do so.

As discussed under Gaining Proficiencies by Time, 0th level NPCs get additional proficiencies with time. Normal humans gain an additional general proficiency after 5 years, 15 years, and 35 years of work. Normal dwarves and elves gain an additional general proficiency after 5, 15, 35, and 70 years of work. Some exceptional 0th level NPCs might train in their downtime to acquire additional general proficiencies faster than 5 – 35 years, as adventurers do (Judge’s discretion).

EXAMPLE: Tavus is a highly intelligent (INT 16) 0th level young man. He begins his career at age 18 with six general proficiencies — four base + two more from his high INT. He selects Craft (Carpenter), Engineering, Labor (Stonecutting), and Mapping with his four starting proficiencies. With his bonus proficiencies he takes two additional ranks in Engineering. At age 23, he gains an additional proficiency, which he uses to take a fourth rank in Engineering. He is now qualified to serve as an Engineer specialist (see **Specialists** in Chapter 4), making him among the youngest engineers in his guild. A character of average Intellect might take a lifetime to gain that same level of proficiency.
