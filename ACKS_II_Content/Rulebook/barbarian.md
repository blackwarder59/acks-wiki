# Barbarian

Key Attribute: STR and CON

Requirements: None

Hit Dice: 1d8

Maximum Level: 14

Barbarians are members of primitive tribes, raised in a savage land beyond the borders of the Auran Empire. Most barbarians begin as members of the Thrassic or Ghinoran tribes, but some might have come from even more distant tribes. Barbarians are untouched by the decadent refinements of civilization; as such, they are hardy, keen of eye, and possessed of an almost supernatural instinct.

## Combat Characteristics

The barbarian's powerful physique and natural fighting instincts make him a dangerous warrior. Barbarians are comfortable with metal armor and weapons, but know that such weighty items can be a hindrance in the wild. All barbarians prefer to forego a shield, and many favor great swords or two-handed axes.

**Combat Proficiencies:** Barbarians have weapon proficiency with all bows, one-handed axes, two-handed axes, clubs, crossbows, daggers, darts, flails, javelins, lances, maces, polearms, short swords, spears, swords, and war hammers. They have armor proficiency with light armor, and most medium armor except for banded armor and chainmail. They also have fighting style proficiency with two-handed weapon fighting (though not shield and weapon or dual weapon fighting).

**Combat Progression:** Barbarians advance in attack throws and saving throws as fighters, by two points every three levels of experience. Barbarians increase their base damage roll from successful missile and melee attacks by +1 at 1st level and by an additional +1 at 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th level. They can cleave after killing a foe a maximum of once per round per class level.

## Starting Class Powers

All barbarians have the class powers below:

**Beast Friendship:** Due to their great rapport with animals, barbarians can attempt to befriend a normal animal by making a Beast Friendship proficiency throw. On a successful throw, they can train the animal as a war dog (see **Equipment**). One animal can be attracted per class level. More details on animal training can be found in the **Campaigns** chapter.

**Berserkergang:** Once per day, a barbarian can fight in a berserker frenzy. Berserkergang can be entered anytime the barbarian attacks or is attacked in melee combat, and lasts a number of rounds equal to the barbarian's Constitution bonus plus his class level. While in berserkergang, the barbarian gains extra attacks per round as shown on the Barbarian Level Progression table above, and becomes immune to fear. However, the barbarian cannot retreat, withdraw, or flee during berserkergang, and he suffers a -2 penalty to AC. If no foes are in melee range of the barbarian at the end of a round of berserkergang, the frenzy immediately ends.

**Fighting Withdrawal:** Barbarians are expert at hit-and-run tactics. A barbarian that is engaged in melee can use the fighting withdrawal maneuver and still attack normally that round, without any penalty to his attack throw.

**Intimidation:** Due to their reputation as berserkers and raiders, barbarians are skilled at Intimidation. Barbarians can use Intimidation as if they had one rank of Intimidation proficiency.

**Natural Armor:** Due to their extraordinary hardiness, barbarians gain a +1 bonus to their AC that stacks with any worn armor.

**Passing without Trace:** In the wilderness, barbarians move with such care that they leave very little evidence of their passage. Barbarians can make Passing without Trace proficiency throws as if they had one rank of Passing without Trace proficiency. With a successful proficiency throw, the barbarian leaves no traces of his passage. The number of followers that can be concealed is equal to the barbarian's level.

**Running:** Barbarians are fleet of foot. They can use Running as if they had one rank of Running proficiency.

**Wilderness Survival:** The barbarian has an extraordinary degree of woodcraft. A barbarian can find food, water, and shelter for himself in any natural environment except desert or arctic. A successful Survival proficiency throw is required to survive in desert or arctic environments. The number of others the barbarian can support is equal to his class level.

## Additional Class Powers

When they advance in level, barbarians gain the following additional class powers:

**Stronghold (9th level):** By acquiring a **stronghold** worth at least 5,000gp, the barbarian can attract a warband to serve under him. 2d6 1st level barbarians will arrive to serve him within 1d6 weeks of him acquiring the stronghold. If the barbarian already has a stronghold, the followers arrive to serve him within 1d6 weeks of him reaching 9th level. If hired, the followers must be paid standard rates for henchmen. The barbarian can use his stronghold and warband to conduct raids and pillaging, dominate local trade routes, and otherwise establish his sovereignty. Additional rules for strongholds and warbands are detailed in the **Campaigns** chapter.

## Class Proficiencies

**Proficiency Progression:** At 1st level, barbarians select two class proficiencies from their class proficiency list. They select an additional class proficiency at 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th level. They select a general proficiency at 5th, 9th, and 13th level. (Barbarians receive more class proficiencies but fewer general ones than most classes.)

**Barbarian Proficiency List:** Alertness, Beast Training, Berserkergang, Boating, Camouflage, Combat Reflexes, Combat Trickery (disarm, sunder), Endurance, Fighting Style Specialization, Hunting, Intimidation, Leadership, Mapping, Riding, Seafaring, Survival, Swashbuckling, Tracking, Trapping, Weapon Focus
