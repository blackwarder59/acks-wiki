Witches are female arcane spellcasters who practice ancient magic rooted in folklore, herbalism, and supernatural bargains. Unlike mages who study in towers and academies, witches learn their craft through traditions passed down through generations, often living as wise women, hedge wizards, or mysterious crones on the outskirts of civilization. Their magic blends arcane and divine elements, drawing power from nature, spirits, and ancient pacts.

## Combat Characteristics

Witches are poor combatants, relying on their magical abilities and supernatural allies rather than martial prowess. They prefer to avoid direct confrontation when possible.

**Combat Proficiencies:** Witches have weapon proficiency with clubs, crossbows, daggers, darts, oil, slings, staves, and any traditional weapons of their cultural background. They have armor proficiency with light armor. They have no fighting style proficiencies.

**Combat Progression:** Witches advance in attack throws and saving throws as mages, by one point every three levels of experience. Witches increase their base damage roll from successful missile and melee attacks by +1 at 1st level and by an additional +1 at 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th level.

## Magic

Witches are unique spellcasters who blend arcane and divine magical traditions. Their magic comes from ancient pacts, natural forces, and supernatural knowledge passed down through witch traditions.

**Spell Acquisition:** Witches acquire spells through a combination of study and tradition. They maintain a grimoire or book of shadows containing their spells, recipes, and rituals. Unlike mages, witches can learn spells from both arcane and divine traditions, though their spell list is more limited. Witches can also create magical potions, charms, and other items. Witches can cast 1st level spells from 1st level.

**Spell Slots:** A witch's spell-casting ability is summarized on the **Witch Spell Progression** table. That table shows the number of spell slots available at each class level, according to the level of the spell. A 1st level witch can cast one 1st level spell per day, while a 14th level witch can cast five 1st level spells, five 2nd level spells, four 3rd level spells, four 4th level spells, four 5th level spells, and three 6th level spells per day.

**Spell Casting:** Witches must have their hands free to cast spells. Witches cannot cast spells while wearing armor heavier than light armor. Witches may cast spells from a spell scroll of arcane or divine spells with a proficiency throw of 10+ (adding the spell level to this throw).

**Spell List:** The list of spells available to witches can be found at the end of this chapter. Witches have access to a unique spell list that combines elements from both arcane and divine traditions.

**Restoring Magic:** Witches regain their ability to cast spells through meditation, ritual, and communion with natural forces. They must spend at least 4 hours in quiet contemplation to recover their spell slots.

## Starting Class Powers

At the start of play, witches have the class powers below:

**Familiar:** A witch begins play with a supernatural familiar - typically a cat, raven, owl, toad, or snake. The familiar has special intelligence and can communicate telepathically with the witch within 1 mile. If the familiar dies, the witch can summon a new one through a week-long ritual costing 100gp in special materials.

**Brewing:** Witches can create magical potions and brews. Starting at 1st level, a witch can brew potions of spells she knows, following the normal magical research rules but at half the normal time and cost. The witch must have the appropriate spell available to cast.

**Hex:** Once per day per level, a witch can place a minor curse on a target within 60 feet. The target must make a saving throw vs. spells or suffer a -1 penalty to attack throws, saving throws, or damage rolls (witch's choice) for 24 hours. This ability does not require spell slots.

**Supernatural Knowledge:** Witches have extensive knowledge of folklore, superstitions, and supernatural creatures. They gain a +2 bonus to all proficiency throws related to identifying supernatural creatures, their weaknesses, and appropriate countermeasures.

**Witch Sight:** A witch can see invisible creatures and detect magical auras at will. This ability functions as detect invisibility and detect magic but has a range of only 30 feet.

## Additional Class Powers

When they advance in level, witches gain the following additional class powers:

**Evil Eye (3rd level):** The witch can curse a target with the evil eye. Once per day, the witch can force a target within 30 feet to make a saving throw vs. spells or be cursed with ill fortune. For the next 24 hours, the target must reroll any natural 20s on attack throws or saving throws.

**Weather Prediction (5th level):** The witch can predict weather patterns with supernatural accuracy. She can foretell weather conditions up to one week in advance with 95% accuracy and can sense approaching storms or other weather phenomena 24 hours in advance.

**Major Hex (7th level):** The witch's hex ability becomes more powerful. She can now inflict more severe curses, such as causing the target to fall asleep for 1 round, become confused for 1 round, or suffer a -2 penalty instead of -1.

**Coven (9th level):** By establishing a **coven** worth at least 8,000gp, the witch can attract other practitioners to serve her. 2d4 1st level witches and 1d6 1st level wise women will arrive to serve her within 1d6 weeks of her establishing the coven. The coven also allows the witch to perform powerful group rituals. Additional rules for covens are detailed in the **Campaigns** chapter.

**Grand Hex (11th level):** Once per day, the witch can cast a powerful curse that functions as the bestow curse spell but does not require a spell slot.

**Witch Queen (13th level):** Once per week, the witch can call upon the power of the ancient witch traditions. For one hour, she gains:
- +4 bonus to all saving throws
- Immunity to charm, fear, and curse effects
- The ability to cast any witch spell without expending spell slots
- Her hexes affect all enemies within 30 feet simultaneously
- All magical creatures within 1 mile must make a saving throw or be compelled to serve her

They select an additional class proficiency at 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th level. They select an additional general proficiency at 5th, 9th, and 13th level.
