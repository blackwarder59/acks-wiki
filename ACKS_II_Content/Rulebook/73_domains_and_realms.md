## Domains and Realms

As its name suggests, the ***Adventurer Conqueror King System***expects characters to advance from wandering adventurers to great conquerors and kings. These rules explain how an adventurer can become a **ruler**.

### Acquiring the Domain

An adventurer begins the process of becoming a ruler by first acquiring an area of land, which will serve as the **territory** of the **domain**. Domains can vary considerably in territory. A very small domain will encompass a 2-square mile territory (one 1.5-mile hex on a local map). A typical domain will encompass a 32-square mile territory (one 6-mile hex on a regional map, or sixteen contiguous 1.5-mile hexes on a local map). A very large domain, fit for a king, might encompass a 500-square mile territory (one 24-mile hex on a continental map, or sixteen contiguous 6-mile hexes on a regional map). A domain’s territory is often contiguous, but it may be noncontiguous if desired. While there are no restrictions on a domain’s size or shape, large and noncontiguous domains are harder to control, as explained below.

Adventurers can acquire a domain in several ways. An adventurer might be **granted** a domain by an existing ruler (usually in exchange for completing a quest and requiring a pledge of fealty to become the ruler’s vassal). While bending the knee has its disadvantages, it can allow an adventurer to get a large domain quickly. If an adventurer wishes to buy civilized land on which to establish a domain, he will find it very expensive; an acre of good land in a civilized territory typically costs 50gp.

EXAMPLE: Marcus has brought a treacherous tribune to justice, and as a reward, the legate Ulrand Valerian grants Marcus the deceased tribune’s domain in exchange for Marcus agreeing to become his vassal. Marcus is now a ruler.

Some adventurers **conquer** their domains by defeating the prior ruler. Conquest is detailed in subsequent chapters (p. XX). Depending on the course of events, a conquered domain might be nothing more than the rubble of a sacked stronghold in a desolate countryside or it might be a rich domain with an intact stronghold and flourishing population.

EXAMPLE: Anárion has defeated the chief of Brythumbria in a pitched battle. With the chief dead and his troops captured or routed, Anárion claims the chief’s stronghold as his own and declares himself chief of Brythumbria. Anárion is now a ruler.

Finally, some adventurers **establish** their own domains in unsettled territory. This requires entering the area with other adventurers or mercenaries and driving off, killing, or pacifying any monsters that dwell there. The larger the domain, the more challenging to clear it and control it. A domain cannot be secured until all monster lairs have been dealt with.

EXAMPLE: Rigan is an explorer who wishes to rule a border fort far from the stinking cesspools called cities. He leads a band of adventurers and mercenaries into the wilderness and together they clear a 6-mile unsettled hex of monsters. Rigan claims the hex as his domain. Rigan is now a ruler. He’s not ruling over anything but empty land, but he’s a ruler.

When a domain is granted, conquered, or established, it gets classified as either a **civilized**, **borderlands**,or **outlands** domain. Existing domains acquired by grant or conquest are classified by the Judge based on the geography, history, and politics of the region. Newly established domains are classified based on their proximity to urban settlements.

* A newly-established domain is classified as civilized if all of its territory is within 48 miles of a city or large town.
* A newly established domain is classified as borderlands if all of its territory is within 72 miles of a city or large town.
* All other newly established domains, as well as all territories that are not part of any domain at all, are classified as outlands.

Domains can change their classification during play as cities rise and fall and population grows and shrinks (see p. XX). Territories that are not part of any domain at all are always classified as **unsettled**, even if they are in proximity to a city or large town!

**Designer’s Note:** In the original rules of ***ACKS****,* domains were classified as civilized, borderlands, or wilderness. This naming convention caused confusion because areas without any domains at all were also called wilderness. Outlands is the new term for thinly-settled but still wilderness territory, while unsettled is the updated term for unsettled wilderness territory.

###### Land Value

Not all land is equally valuable. Therefore we assign each 6-mile hex a **land value** in gp per peasant family per month. High land revenue means the domain is rich in farm produce, timber, furs, stone, or even minerals. Low land revenue represents barren, infertile soil with limited natural resources. Roll 3d3 per hex to determine its land value. The Judge should determine the exact reason for the land’s value (or lack thereof) based on the roll.

There are three ways an adventurer can discover the land value of a hex, either by land survey, inquiry, or settlement.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Terrain Type** | **Target Value** |
| Clear, Grass | 11+ |
| Scrub, Hills | 17+ |
| Barren, Desert | 18+ |
| Mountains, Woods | 19+ |
| Swamp, Jungle | 20+ |

**Land Survey:** A land surveyor (either an NPC hireling or an adventurer with the Land Surveying proficiency) can assess the land value of a 6-mile hex. Assessing land value counts as a dedicated activity for one day. At the end of the day, the land surveyor makes a Land Surveying proficiency throw. The target value of the proficiency throw is based on the terrain. It is easy to survey the value of arable fields and pasture, but surveying the value of forests, jungles, and mountains is considerably more time-consuming as it involves, e.g., prospecting for minerals or sampling trees. If the proficiency throw succeeds, the character correctly assesses the land value of the hex and the Judge should reveal the number. If the proficiency throw fails with an unmodified 1, the character incorrectly assesses the land value of the hex, and the Judge should roll or choose a false value to reveal. (The false value will be revealed as such when the land is settled). On any other result, the character does not yet have enough information to make or revise an assessment. Land surveying in wilderness terrain is risky. Make an encounter throw each day.

**Inquiry:** If the domain is already settled by peasant families, the ruler can simply ask the peasants to tell him the land value. The peasants are usually honest, if only for fear of being caught, but peasants working particularly rich land are sometimes inclined to minimize the value of their land to reduce taxes (Judge’s discretion). Wise rulers trust but verify with a land survey.

**Settling the Land:** If the domain is not already settled by peasant families, then the process of settlement itself will reveal the domain’s land value to its ruler. The ruler learns the actual land value of the hex when he receives his first month’s revenue. See **Attracting Peasants**, below.

**Land Value Simplified (optional):** For a simpler approach, Judges may apply the same land value to all 6-mile hexes within a single 24-mile hex, or (for maximum simplicity) treat all land values as 6. By default, ***ACKS II*** products assume land values of 6gp for most NPC domains, reserving detailed land values for PC domains.

### Securing the Domain

The adventurer must now **secure his domain** by claiming or constructing a stronghold on its territory. If there is an existing structure that’s suitable for use as a stronghold on the domain, this structure can be claimed by the adventure as his stronghold. This structure might be a castle granted with the land, or a tunnel complex cleared of its prior inhabitants in the process of securing the domain, and so on. Otherwise, the adventurer will need to construct his own stronghold to secure his new territory. See Chapter 4 p. XX – XX for rules regarding construction of strongholds.

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Minimum Stronghold Value** | | | |
| **Classification** | **Per 1.5-mi hex** | **Per 6-mi. hex** | **Per 24-mi. hex** |
| Civilized | 1,000gp | 15,000gp | 240,000gp |
| Borderlands | 1,500gp | 22,500gp | 360,000gp |
| Outlands | 2,000gp | 32,000gp | 512,000gp |

In order to secure a domain, a stronghold must meet a **minimum value**, based on the size and classification of the domain to be secured. Small domains in civilized realms can be secured with a stone home or tower, but large tracts of outlands territory can only be secured with a formidable stronghold. The Minimum Stronghold Value table shows the minimum value required to secure each 1.5-mile hex, 6-mile hex, and 24-mile hex in a domain based on its classification. If a domain has multiple strongholds, the total value of all strongholds in the domain should be counted. A stronghold of insufficient value will make the domain harder to control. See **Keeping the Peace**, below.

In most cases, the stronghold the adventurer uses to attract his followers can be the same stronghold with which he secures his domain. However, guildhouses and hideouts cannot secure domains no matter how valuable they are. An assassin, nightblade, venturer, or thief who wants to rule a domain can do so, but must claim or construct a separate stronghold to govern from. Note that it’s possible for a stronghold to have sufficient value to attract followers (15,000gp) to the ruler, but not sufficient value to secure the ruler’s domain, or vice versa.

EXAMPLE: Marcus has been granted a tribunate. The tribunate’s territory consists of two 6-mile borderlands hexes. The minimum stronghold value is therefore (22,500gp x 2) = 45,000gp. The prior tribune’s stronghold consisted of a headquarters, two barracks, and four watch towers, with a total value of 87,500gp. Since Marcus has been granted the prior tribune’s stronghold, his domain is secure.

EXAMPLE: Anárion has conquered the domain of Brythumbria from its prior chief. Brythumbria’s territory consists of one 6-mile wilderness hex, so it has a minimum stronghold value of 32,000gp. The prior chief’s stronghold had been worth 40,000gp but it was badly damaged in the conquest and is currently only worth 30,000gp. Anárion orders that 2,000gp be spent to rebuild the outer walls. Until this construction is complete, Anárion’s domain is considered insecure, which will affect his domain morale.

EXAMPLE: Rigan has established a domain by clearing its territory, a 6-mile wilderness hex, of all monsters. The domain’s minimum stronghold value is therefore 32,000gp. There is no existing structure in the territory that Rigan could claim, so Rigan must construct a 32,000gp stronghold from scratch to secure his domain.

###### Noncontiguous Domains and Strongholds

Most domains are established with contiguous territory, such that a single stronghold can easily secure the entire domain. If a domain is established in a noncontiguous area of land, then a stronghold or set of strongholds must be built that is large enough to secure all the noncontiguous hexes in between the domain’s territories. If this is not done, the stronghold will count as being of insufficient value and domain morale will suffer.

EXAMPLE: Quintus has established a new domain consisting of four 6-mile borderlands hexes. Three of the hexes are clustered contiguously, while the fourth lies a distance of 18 miles (3 6-mile hexes) away. His stronghold must be of sufficient value to secure seven 6-mile hexes — the three contiguous hexes, the noncontiguous hex, and the three hexes in between. Therefore its value must be (22,500 x 7) 157,500gp or more.

###### Littoral Domains and Navies

Just as strongholds secure the countryside, vessels can secure the sea. When a domain’s territory is adjacent to one or more 6-mile hexes of navigable water, the domain ruler can apply the gp value of his navy towards his stronghold value for purposes of securing those hexes. To count as part of a navy, a vessel must either be a galley or a longship and must have its full complement of crew (captain, navigator, sailors, rowers, and/or marines). The crew for a naval vessel can be paid for out of, and counts towards, garrison expenditure.

### Attracting Peasants

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Families Arriving with Followers** | |
| **Hex Classification** | **Arriving Peasant Families** |
| Civilized | 8d6 x 10 per 6-mile hex |
| Borderlands | 3d6 x 10 per 6-mile hex |
| Outlands | 1d4+1 x 10 per 6-mile hex |

If the adventurer has acquired an existing domain by grant or conquest, he will begin his reign with peasant families on his lands. However, if the adventurer has established a new domain, it will be unoccupied until he attracts peasants to settle there. There are a number of ways that the population of peasant families in the ruler’s domains can be increased.

###### Arrival of Followers

When a domain ruler attracts followers, the followers bring with them a number of peasant families that settle in his domain. Some of these peasant families are the friends and relatives of the followers, i.e. civilians coming to support the soldiery. Others are immigrants attracted by the promise of a fresh start under the protection of the powerful adventurer. These peasant families become permanent inhabitants of the adventurer’s domain.The number of peasant families that settle in the domain is determined on the Families Arriving with Followers table. Roll for each hex of the domain’s territory as of the moment when the followers arrive. Each peasant family is assumed to have an average of 5 peasants. Families will be of the same race as the adventurer, e.g. elven fastnesses are settled by elven peasants. The foregoing notwithstanding, followers attracted by a guildhouse or a hideout do not bring peasants with them. The point of a hideout is that it’s hidden…

EXAMPLE: When Marcus was granted his tribunate, he was only 7th level. A few years later, Marcus reaches 9th level and gains the Castle class power. Because he has a stronghold worth 15,000gp, he attracts 5d6 x 10 mercenaries and 1d6 1st – 3rd level fighters as followers. These followers arrive within 1d3 months. With the followers come a number of families keen on settling in Marcus’s domain. With two 6-mile borderlands hexes, Marcus attracts 6d6 x 10 peasant families. These families add to his current domain population.

EXAMPLE: When Anárion conquered Brythumbria, he was already 10th level. However, he hadn’t yet acquired a stronghold worth at least 15,000gp, so he hadn’t attracted followers. Now, however, he has taken his defeated foe’s 30,000gp-stronghold as his own. 1d3 months after he becomes chief of Brythumbria, Anárion attracts 5d6 x 10 mercenaries and 1d6 1st – 3rd level barbarians as followers. With the followers come a number of families seeking Anárion’s governance. Since Brythumbria’s territory is one 6-mile outlands hex, Anárion attracts 1d4+1 x 10 peasant families. These families add to his current domain population.

EXAMPLE: When Rigan completed his border fort, he was 9th level. 1d3 months after the stronghold is built, Rigan attracts 5d6 x 10 mercenaries and 1d6 1st – 3rd level explorers. With those followers come peasants seeking a new life under Rigan’s protection. Since Rigan established a domain of one 6-mile hex of outlands, he attracts 1d4+1 x 10 peasant families. These families become the first inhabitants of his new domain.

###### Immigration from Investment

A ruler can encourage immigration into his domain by making **agricultural investments** into the area. For every 1000gp spent on investments in a month, the domain will attract 1d10 new peasant families. The maximum amount that may be spent in investment per month is equal to the domain’s monthly revenue or 1000gp, whichever is greater.

EXAMPLE: When Rigan’s followers arrived, they came with 30 peasant families. In order to increase his domain’s population, Rigan spends 1,000gp each month on agricultural investments. Each month he does so, he attracts 1d10 additional peasant families.

###### Immigration from Prestige

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Population (families)** | **Increase** | **Population (Families)** | **Increase** |
| 1 – 100 | +5d20 | 301 – 400 | +3d10 |
| 101 – 200 | +5d10 | 401 – 500 | +2d10 |
| 201 – 300 | +4d10 | 500+ | +1d10 |

Adventurers can attract additional peasants to move to their domains by deeds of heroism and valor. Provided an adventurer actively adventures at least once per month and keeps his domain secure from threats, his domain’s population will grow by a random amount each month, determined by the number of families already present. Elven domains always increase in population as if they were two population categories larger (e.g. a population of 350 families grows as if it were 500+). Dwarven domains increase in population as if they were one population category larger (e.g. a population of 50 families grows if it were 101 – 200).

EXAMPLE: Brythumbria currently has a population of 210 families. Anárion rules from his chieftain’s hall for several months. Then he sets out on an adventure to slay a dragon that has been plaguing the Rornish people. While he’s away, his trusty followers keep the domain secure. Since he’s gone an adventure and kept his domain secure, he attracts an additional 4d10 peasant families. If Anárion were a dwarven ruler, he’d only have attracted 3d10 families; if he were an elven ruler, 2d10.

###### Population Growth and Shrinkage

If a ruler is fortunate, birth and immigration will naturally increase the population of a domain. If he is unlucky, fire, disease, and emigration will decrease it. Each month, a ruler makes two die rolls of 1d10! per 1,000 families in the domain (rounded up). These rolls will determine the change in his domain’s population. The first roll determines the increase in the domain’s number of peasant families, and the second roll determines the decrease in the domain’s number of peasant families.

EXAMPLE: Marcus’s tribunate has grown dramatically. It now has a population of 1,200 peasant families. He will make two die rolls of 2d10. Marcus first rolls 2d10! for increase and gets a 3 and an 8. His domain gains 11 peasant families. He then rolls 2d10! for decrease and gets a 10 and a 7. Since one of the dice rolled a “10”, he must roll that die again and add it to the total. This roll results in another 10! Marcus has to roll yet again, this time getting a 4. His total is 10+7+10+4, or 31. Marcus’s domain loses 31 peasant families. Having gained 11 and lost 31, Marcus’s domain ends up down 20 peasant families.

**Stagnant Domains (optional):** Note that if a domain ruler is not actively adventuring, does not make agricultural investments, and does not have very high domain morale, the gain and loss in population each month will tend to equalize and domain population will be flat. For faster play, the Judge may assume that population increase from birth and immigration and population decrease from death and emigration are equal in domains with a morale of 0. Instead of rolling two die rolls of 1d10 every month, the ruler only rolls dice for population change from active adventuring and from morale (q.v.)

###### Limits of Growth

The classification and territory of a domain determine its maximum population. An outlands domain cannot exceed 185 families per 6-mile hex (30 people per square mile). A borderlands domain cannot exceed 375 families per 6-mile hex (60 people per square mile). A civilized domain cannot exceed 780 families per 6-mile hex (125 people per square mile).

To increase the number of families in his domain beyond these limits, a ruler may either secure additional territory; establish an **urban settlement** with **urban families** in existing territory; or improve the domains classification from outlands to borderland or borderlands to civilized. Acquiring territory is handled as above (q.v.). Establishing urban settlements is discussed in the **Villages**, **Towns**, **and Cities** rules below. Improving domain classification follows the rules below.

**Advancing from Outlands to Borderland:** An outlands domain becomes a borderlands domain if, at the end of any month, either:

* The domain has at least 185 families, is connected by road to a small town within 24 miles, and has a morale score of +1 or better;
* The domain has a territory of at least 5 hexes populated by at least 925 families and has a morale score of +1 or better; or
* An urban settlement has been established in the domain that is within 72 miles of a friendly city or large town.

**Advancing from Borderland to Civilized:** A borderlands domain becomes a civilized domain if, at the end of any month:

* The domain has at least 375 families, is connected by road to a small town within 24 miles, and has a morale score of +1 or better;
* The domain has a territory of at least 7 hexes populated by at least 1,200 families and has a morale score of +1 or better; or
* An urban settlement has been established in the domain that is within 48 miles of a friendly city or large town.

The Judge might advance a domain’s classification for other in-game circumstances that seem to merit it (Judge’s discretion). Once a domain has improved in classification, the improvement is permanent, even if the requirements for the classification are no longer being met.

**Regress of Classification (Optional):** Domains might regress in classification at the Judge’s discretion if the circumstances merit it. For instance, if a city gradually declines in population into a small town, that would probably not be enough to reduce the nearby domains from civilized to borderlands. But if the city were sacked and destroyed by a powerful monster that now terrorizes the region, the domains around it might be justifiably reduced from civilized to borderlands. The Judge is the arbiter of such cases.

**Littoral Hexes (Optional):** Communities that can exploit the bounty of the sea can maintain higher population densities. When a domain’s territory is adjacent to one or more 6-mile hexes of fishable water, the domain can count the adjacent hexes of water as part of its territory for purposes of calculating its limits of growth.

**Alternative Farming Methods (Optional):** The limits of growth above assume the low-yield mixed-use farming methods detailed in ***The Economics of Peasant Farming***in the ***Judges Journal***. Intensive cultivation of high yield crops twice per year could yield population densities eight times higher. To emulate a particular historical setting, the Judge can adjust the limits of growth where appropriate.

### Collecting Revenue

Each month, a ruler collects revenue from each peasant family in his domain. There are four sources of revenue: land revenue, service revenue, tax revenue, and tribute. The first three types of revenue are generated by the domain’s peasant families, while the last is only generated if the ruler has one or more vassal domains (described below).

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Source** | **Monthly Revenue** |
| Land | 3 – 9gp / family |
| Services | 4gp/ family |
| Taxes | 2gp/ family |
| Tribute | Varies |

**Land:** As noted under **Securing the Domain** (above), land revenue derives from labor on the domain’s lands. It includes wheat, barley, and other grains; cheese, milk, meat, bee honey, and other animal products; and clay, stone, coal, and metals. The average domain produces 6gp of land revenue per peasant, but not all land is equally valuable. Each hex of the domain’s land revenue will have been determined with a roll of 3d3 when the domain was first secured — this value is the monthly land revenue per peasant family in that hex.

EXAMPLE: Rigan has secured a 6-mile hex domain in the forest across the Mirmen River. The Judge rolls 3d3 to determine what his land revenue will be. His results were 3, 2, 3, for a total of 8. Each peasant family that settles there will generate 8gp of land revenue per month. The Judge determines the land is so valuable because of an abundance of timber and fur.

**Services:** Services revenue derives from the services of skilled tradesmen, such as baking, carpentry, lumbering, milling, and smithing. Most of these services are provided by freemen who offer a portion of their labor to the ruler in exchange for the right to practice their trade on his domain. Monthly service revenue is 4gp per family.

**Tax:** Tax revenue is coin paid directly to the ruler by his peasants. The ruler of a domain has the right to collect fees upon marriage, inheritance, birth and death, harvest, and other occasions; to levy fines and fees for administering justice; to charge tolls for the roads; to charge a duty on merchants in his markets; and to levy a rent and tax on those working the land. The sum of these constitutes the domain’s monthly tax revenue of 2gp per family. Tax revenue can be increased above this amount but doing so damages the peasants’ loyalty. Lower taxes, on the other hand, can improve the domain’s morale.

**Tribute:** Tribute is revenue received from vassal domains controlled by the ruler but managed on his behalf by henchmen. Tribute varies based on the rank and realm of the vassal. See **Establishing the Realm**,below.

###### Improving Land

As a 25,000gp construction project, a ruler may improve the land value of a 6-mile hex by 1gp. Land value may never be increased by more than 3gp and never to more than 9gp. However, land improvements are very fragile. If a domain has land improvements, their value is reduced by 1gp per 1gp plundered from the domain during pillaging (see **Maneuvers**for details on looting and pillaging.) During a siege, land improvements can be destroyed by bombardment as wooden structures — multiply shp dealt by 8 to calculate loss of gp value.

### Paying Expenses

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Source** | **Monthly Expense** |
| Garrison | 2gp / family |
| Liturgies | 1gp / family |
| Mainten. | 1gp / family |
| Tithes | 1gp / family |
| Tribute | Varies |

After collecting revenue, a ruler must pay certain expenses in order to maintain his domain.

**Garrison:** In order to maintain the security of his domain, a ruler must expend 2gp per peasant family per month on a garrison of troops. The ruler should specify the exact make-up of the garrison, hiring an appropriate number of mercenaries or conscripting troops. The **Armies** chapter (p. XX) has more details. Certain special rules apply:

* The gold piece value of a trained and equipped militia can also be applied against the garrison cost of a domain, even if the militia is not called up. Dwarven vaults and elven fastnesses automatically have trained and equipped militia worth 2gp per family. (See p. XXfor details on training and equipping militia and p. XX for vaults and fastnesses.)
* The gold piece value of scutage paid to a ruler’s lord as a Duty (see below) can be applied against the garrison cost of the domain.
* The gold piece value of troops provided by a ruler’s lord as a Favor (see below) can sometimes be applied against the garrison cost of the domain. If the ruler is paying scutage, then the value of troops supplied in excess of his scutage can be applied. If the ruler has called up troops, then the value of troops provided is reduced by the value of troops supplied.

Garrison cost cannot be paid with expenditure on henchman, mercenary officers, specialists, or any other hireling except actual troops.

The garrison cost above is a minimum expenditure. A ruler may spend more on his garrison if desired. Rulers of realms subject to frequent invasion often maintain large garrisons to avoid morale problems. Borderland domains often maintain garrisons of 3gp per family and outlands domains must maintain garrisons of 4gp per family or base morale will be reduced. See **Keeping the Peace**, below.

**Liturgies:** A ruler will be expected to pay for ceremonial games, sporting events, religious feasts, country festivals, and public works that please and impress the domain’s peasant families. The cost of liturgies is 1gp per peasant family. If this tradition is not honored, the loyalty of the population to the ruler will be reduced.

**Maintenance:** A ruler must pay 1gp per peasant family to maintain his domain’s stronghold. Failure to pay maintenance reduces the stronghold value of the domain (by 1gp per gp of unpaid maintenance), which can reduce the domain’s base morale score and make it harder to control.

**Tithes:** A ruler must pay a tithe of 1gp per peasant family to the church of the domain’s dominant religion. If the domain ruler is a bladedancer or crusader, the domain’s dominant religion is the ruler’s. Otherwise, the domain’s dominant religion is the prevailing religion of the region (Judge’s discretion). If the tithe is not paid, the loyalty of the population to the ruler will be reduced, and the ruler may be declared a heretic or excommunicated by the church. The domain ruler may change the domain’s religion but doing so causes substantial penalties to domain morale. See **Keeping the Peace**, below.

Note that even a domain ruled by a bladedancer or crusader must pay tithes. Churches and temples in ***ACKS*** are assumed to generate revenue from both owning land and from receiving tithes. The individual abbot, bishop, or other ecclesiastic ruler of each domain will receive and spend the land revenue, while the overall head of the religion will control the funds from tithes.

**Tribute:** If a ruler holds a domain within the realm of a superior lord, he will have to pay a tribute to his liege. A ruler who fails to pay tribute risks retribution from his lord. See **Establishing the Realm**, below.

###### Magistrates

The domain ruler doesn’t personally count the tithes to the temple or oversee the workmen on the castle. He has various NPC magistrates who handle such matters for him. The cost of these magistrates is subsumed into the domain expense total. If desired, however, the domain ruler can appoint specific qualifying PCs or NPCs as his magistrates**.** There are four types of magistrates, each with its own qualification requirements.

* **Captain of the Guard:** The captain of the guard oversees the domain’s garrison expenditure. The captain of the guard must have both Command and Manual of Arms proficiencies.
* **Chaplain:** The chaplain oversees het domain’s tithe expenditure. The chaplain must have the ability to cast divine magic and at least one rank of Theology proficiency.
* **Munerator**: The munerator oversees the domain’s liturgies expenditure. The munerator must have Diplomacy proficiency and at least one rank in a Performance proficiency.
* **Steward:** The steward oversees the domain’s maintenance expenditure. The steward must have Bargaining proficiency and at least one rank in a Craft or Profession proficiency.

Each month, the magistrate keeps 12.5% of the domain expense he oversees as his salary for his services. This salary does not increase the ruler’s domain expenses or decrease the funds available to pay his troops. It’s abstractly paid out of his domain expenses. The salary does count as domain income for the magistrate and grants campaign XP to the extent it exceeds the magistrate’s GP threshold (see p. XX).

Magistrates are usually either fellow adventurers, followers, or henchmen of the ruler. Non-henchman magistrates might be susceptible to corruption or treachery (Judge’s discretion).

**Designer’s Note:** These magistrate rules work best when the players are collaborating to run a single domain, as one can serve as ruler and the others can serve as magistrates. Some players aren’t interested in running a domain but would still like to earn XP from campaign activities.

### Earning Domain Income

Domain income is the difference between domain revenue and domain expenses. For independent realms, domain income calculations are easily calculated on a per-family basis. Domains that are part of a larger realm will have tribute revenue and costs as well. Domain income can give an adventurer campaign XP (p. XX).

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Domain** | **Revenue per Family** | **Costs per Family** | **Income per Family** |
| Outlands | Land (3-9gp) + Service (4gp) + Tax (2gp) | Garrison (4gp) + Liturgies (1gp) + Tithes (1gp) + Maint. (1gp) | ~ 5gp |
| Borderlands | Land (3-9gp) + Service (4gp) + Tax (2gp) | Garrison (3gp) + Liturgies (1gp) + Tithes (1gp) + Maint. (1gp) | ~ 6gp |
| Civilized | Land (3-9gp) + Service (4gp) + Tax (2gp) | Garrison (2gp) + Liturgies (1gp) + Tithes (1gp) + Maint. (1gp) | ~ 7gp |

Note that if the ruler of a borderlands or outlands domain spends only the minimum 2gp per family on its garrison then its income per family is the same as a civilized domain, but its base morale will be reduced.

### Establishing the Realm

Through conquest, expansion, or politics, a ruler may find himself in control of a domain that is too large to safely control. At any time, a ruler may divide the territory of an existing domain into one or more smaller domains, each with its own territory and families. A ruler may also establish new domains by acquiring land and constructing strongholds, or conquer a new domain, or be granted a new domain in a treaty. However the situation comes about, a group of domains under the control of one ruler are collectively called a **realm**.However, a ruler can only directly rule one domain, known as his **personal domain**. Other domains in the realm are considered **vassal domains**, and must be assigned to a henchman, called a **vassal**, to rule.

Since the number of henchmen any character may employ is limited to between 1 and 7 (depending on his Charisma), rulers may end up with more territory under their control than can be managed even by assigning one domain to each of their henchmen. In this case, multiple vassal domains can be assigned to trusted henchmen, who then themselves have to sub-assign vassal domains to their own henchmen. A group of domains ruled by a vassal is called a **vassal realm**.A ruler may himself be a sub-vassal to another ruler that he has sworn fealty to (usually the lord who granted him the land to build his domain).

EXAMPLE: Quintus rules a realm of thirteen domains. He has six henchmen. He manages one domain directly, and assigns two vassal domains to each of his six henchmen. Each of his six henchmen thus has a vassal realm of two domains. Each manages one of their domains directly, and sub-assigns the other as a vassal domain to his own henchman.

###### Titles of Nobility

Adventurers and other domain rulers may claim a title of nobility or be awarded one by their lord. If the adventurer secures his domain within an existing realm, his title will be awarded based on the heraldry of that realm. The more domains the adventurer controls (including assigned and sub-assigned vassal domains), the higher the title he will hold. An adventurer who establishes a new realm can claim any title he wishes, of course, but other realms will not necessarily treat him as such. A domain ruler may award titles below his own to his own vassals.

Three factors determine a ruler’s title — the size of his personal domain, the number of vassal domains he has, and the overall size of the realm he rules. The Titles of Nobility table shows the common titles of nobility used based on these criteria. A common title is provided for each tier, plus titles used by cultures within the Auran Empire campaign setting.

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Titles of Nobility** | | | | | | | |
| **Personal**  **Domain (families)** | **Number of**  **Domains Ruled** | **Overall**  **Realm (families)** | **Common** | **Auran**  **Empire** | **Argollëan**  **(Elven)** | **Somirean** | **Jutlandic** |
| 12,500 | 5,461-55,987 | 2M – 11.6M+ | Emperor | Tarkaun | Ard-rí | Maharaja | High King |
| 12,500 | 1,365-9,331 | 364,000 – 2,000,000 | King | Exarch | Rí-ruirech | Raja | King |
| 7,500 | 341-1,555 | 87,000 – 322,000 | Prince | Prefect | Rí | Deshmukh | Prince |
| 1,500 | 85-259 | 20,000 – 52,000 | Duke | Palatine | Diuc | Zammin | Duke |
| 780 | 21-43 | 4,600 – 8,500 | Count | Legate | Iarla | Mansab | Jarl |
| 320 | 5-7 | 960 – 1,280 | Viscount | Tribune | Ard-tiarna | Sardar | Reeve |
| 160 | 1 | 160 | Baron | Castellan | Tiarna | Jagir | Thane |

###### Tribute

Each month, a ruler will **collect tribute** from his vassals (if any) and **pay tribute** to his lord (if he has one). The amount of tribute each ruler receives from his vassals, and the amount each must pay to his own lord, is determined by the number of families in their realms. While tribute increases as a realm goes larger, there are diminishing returns. The larger a realm becomes, the more difficult and expensive the collection of tribute becomes. Appraising the amount of tribute required, collecting it, transporting it, accounting for its receipt, and storing it are manual processes, each expensive, and each vassal will extract some percentage of tribute for himself before paying his own lord.

Most rulers in the Auran Empire and other fantasy settings lack access to spreadsheets, so a ruler’s title of nobility is usually used as a proxy for estimating how much tribute is owed. The Tribute by Title table provides a range of tribute values for various rules showing how much they would pay by their title.

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Title** | **Tribute (Minimum)** | **Tribute (Average)** | **Tribute (Maximum)** |
| King | 36,000gp (~365,000 families) | 80,000gp (~1,100,000 families) | 110,000gp (~2,000,000 families) |
| Prince | 16,500gp (~87,000 families) | 27,000gp (~205,000 families) | 34,000gp (~322,000 families) |
| Duke | 6850gp (~20,000 families) | 9750gp (~36,000 families) | 12,000gp (~52,000 families) |
| Count | 2850gp (~4600 families) | 3650gp (~6500 families) | 4375gp (~8500 families) |
| Viscount | 1125gp (~960 families) | 1200gp (~1125 families) | 1325gp (~1280 families) |
| Baron | 275gp (~100 families) | 425gp (~200 families) | 550gp (~300 families) |

For NPC rulers, the Judge can select an appropriate value based on the ruler’s title, the families in his realm, and the known wealth and prosperity of his realm. Adventurers can set the tribute for their own vassals as desired. Changing a vassal’s tribute always triggers a roll on the Henchman Loyalty table. If the Judge determines a particular vassal’s tribute is set at an unreasonable level (either too low or too high), he may impose a penalty on all loyalty rolls by the vassal. (Demanding too little tribute suggests the lord is weak and not worthy of respect, demanding too much suggests he is grasping or desperate.)

EXAMPLE #1: Tarkaun Valros Valuin rules the Auran Empire, a realm of 4,319,990 families. He has five vassals, the Exarchs of Tirenea (1,287,000 families), Nicea (1,028,804 families), Krysea (901,624 families), Opelenea (530,419 families), and Southern Argollë (459,255 families). Looking at the Titles of Nobility table, the Judge notes that Tirenea, Nicea, and Krysea are all moderately populated kingdoms, while Opelenea and Southern Argollë are relatively small kingdoms. He decides that the Tarkaun collects the following tribute: Tirenea 85,000gp; Nicea 75,000gp; Krysea 70,000gp; Opelenea 50,000gp; and Southern Argollë 40,000gp. His total revenue from tribute is 320,000gp (it’s good to be the Tarkaun).

EXAMPLE #2: The Exarch of Southern Argollë rules a realm that consists of his personal domain (21,059 families) and four Prefectures with 109,549 families each, for a total of 459,255 families. The Judge rules that he must pay 40,000gp in tribute. The Judge decides that he receives 20,000gp from each of his Prefectures, or 80,000gp total.

**Calculating Precise Tribute (Optional):** Judges who prefer working mathematically can use the following formula to calculate a precise tribute: 18gp x realm families0.6. The Tribute by Realm Families tables, below, can also be used to assess the tribute that a ruler must pay, and the tribute that he collects from each of his vassals. Use the closest value to the actual number of families in the realm. Note that results on the Tribute by Families tables are rounded to the nearest increment of 5gp, while those on the Tribute by Title table are rounded more broadly, so results vary slightly.

OPTIONAL EXAMPLE #1: Tarkaun Drakomir rules the Auran Empire, a realm of 4,319,990 families. He has five vassals, the Exarch of Tirenea (1,287,000 families), Nicea (1,028,804 families), Krysea (901,624 families), Opelenea (530,419 families), Southern Argollë (459,255 families). Consulting the Tribute by Realm Population tables, the Judge determines that the Tarkaun collects the following tribute: Tirenea 83,875gp; Nicea 75,875gp; Krysea 67,270gp; Opelenea 47,445gp; and Southern Argollë 41,275gp. His total revenue from tribute is 315,740gp (it’s good to be the Tarkaun).

OPTIONAL EXAMPLE #2: The Exarch of Southern Argollë rules a realm that consists of his personal domain (21,059 families) and four Prefectures with 109,549 families each, for a total of 459,255 families. According to the Tribute by Realm Population tables, he must pay 41,275gp in tribute. He will receives 19,060gp in tribute from each of his four Prefectures, for a total of 76,240gp.

###### Favors and Duties

In addition to paying tribute to his lord (as described above), a vassal ruler must roll once per month on the Favors and Duties table to see what favors are granted or asked by his lord. These events can serve the Judge as the basis for adventures for the player character. Adventurers with vassals may choose to offer favors and demand duties to their own vassals, either in response to favors and duties they receive, or independently.

During any month, each vassal can be safely asked to perform one ongoing duty, plus an additional ongoing duty for each ongoing favor and each one-time favor given this month. If an adventurer demands duties in excess of this total, the vassal’s loyalty must be checked on the Hireling Loyalty table for each extra duty. There is a cumulative -1 penalty for each additional duty levied on the vassal after the duty that triggers the roll. Note that a one-time favor only offsets a duty during the month it is given (such gifts are quickly taken for granted…). Charters of monopoly count as one favor, even if granted to cover multiple types of merchandise.

A lord may always choose to demand less when demanding a duty. For instance, he might demand a loan of just 0.5gp per family in the vassal’s realm, or levy scutage on only a fraction of the vassal’s overall realm. The entries on the Favor/Duty do not exhaust the possible edicts that a ruler might impose on his vassal. The Judge should feel free to devise additional favors and duties based on the particulars of his campaign setting.

EXAMPLE: Quintus has a vassal named Cadom. Cadom rules a realm with 650 families in his personal domain and 1,600 families in the realm. In the first month of summer, Quintus demands Cadom loan him an amount equal to 1gp per family in his realm, or 1600gp total (one duty). No roll on the Henchman Loyalty table is required, as a lord is entitled to one duty from his vassal. The next month, Quintus leaves the loan unpaid (one duty), and calls Cadom to arms. He gives Cadom a gift of a gilded masterwork longsword worth 1600gp (a favor). No roll on the Henchman Loyalty table is required. The third month he maintains both the unpaid loan and the call to arms but offers no favors. Cadom has now been charged with two duties, with no offsetting favors, so he must now roll on the Henchman Loyalty table.

The fourth month, Quintus finds himself in need of even more troops, so he now calls Cadom to arms again. He offers no favors. Cadom has now been charged with three duties with no offsetting favors. He must make a roll on the Henchmen Loyalty table at -1 (i.e. no roll required for one duty; roll required at no penalty for two duties; roll required at -1 for three duties). Fortunately Cadom remains loyal. In the fifth month, Quintus holds festivals in Cadom’s realm to honor for his military exploits, spending 1600gp towards liturgy expenses in Cadom’s realm. He also repays the loan. Cadom has now received one favor and been charged with two duties, so no roll on the Henchman Loyalty table is required.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Roll (1d20) | Favor / Duty |
| 1 | **Construction:** The vassal is ordered to construct bridges, roads, forts, towers, or other structures somewhere within his realm. If a littoral domain, the vassal may be ordered to construct vessels. Each month, the vassal will be expected to expend a total amount of gp equal to his monthly tribute to the ruler. This duty is automatically revoked when the vassal expends a total of 15,000gp per 6-mile hex in his realm. |
| 2 | **Scutage:** The lord demands the vassal to pay a special tax to fund troops. The tax is equal to 1gp per family in the vassal’s realm. This duty can be imposed multiple times. The tax must be paid each month until the duty is revoked. However, scutage counts as garrison expense for the vassal. In some realms, a vassal may send troops instead of gp (see Call to Arms, below). A lord who receives scutage must spend the funds on troops or provoke Henchman Loyalty rolls at -4. Scutage does not count as domain income for XP purposes. |
| 3 – 4 | **Call to Council:** The vassal is called to provide judicial and managerial council to his lord. He must travel to his lord’s domain to provide this service until the duty is revoked. If this duty is rolled again, the lord summons the vassal’s henchmen in addition (who would issue his own Call to Council upon them). |
| 5 – 6 | **Call to Arms:** The vassal is called to provide military troops to his lord. He must muster an army with troop wages equal to 1gp per family in his realm and make it available to his lord until the duty is revoked. He does not have to go personally unless a Call to Council favor is also demanded. This duty can be imposed multiple times, increasing the gp value of troop wages accordingly. |
| 7 – 8 | **Loan:** The lord demands a loan equal to 1gp per family in the vassal’s realm. The loan is repaid when the duty is revoked. Otherwise, the probability of repayment is equal to the adventurer’s CHA stated as a percentage, rolled monthly. Repayment of the loan revokes the duty. No interest will be paid in either case. This duty can be imposed multiple times. |
| 9 – 12 | **Previous duty/favor revoked:** The vassals loses his most recently granted favor (1) or duty (2 – 6). |
| 13 – 14 | **Charter of Monopoly:** The vassal is granted a monopoly on a particular type of merchandise within his realm. Merchants will buy or sell twice the normal volume of that type from him, and prices are adjusted by 1 price step in his favor. (A lord may not grant a monopoly to a vassal if his lord has already given that monopoly to another, or if he has been awarded it as a favor from his own lord.) This is an ongoing favor. |
| 15 – 16 | **Gift:** The lord gives the vassal a gift with a value at least equal to 1gp per family in the vassal’s realm. The gift may be agricultural investments, land improvements, festivals, treasure, warhorses, slaves, merchandise, magical items, etc. (Judge’s discretion). Gifts increase the vassal recipient’s domain income for XP purposes and decrease the grantor-lord’s. This is a one-time favor. |
| 17 – 18 | **Office:** The vassal is granted a ceremonial office appropriate to his land holdings (e.g. “Knight Marshal,” “Keeper of the Seals,” or “Royal Chancellor”). Holding an office increases a vassal’s prestige and status and grants the officeholder a +1 bonus to loyalty rolls by the officeholder’s own vassals. If the lord’s realm is a senatorial realm (see p. XX), an officeholder must be given a seat on the lord’s senate. This is an ongoing favor. If this favor is granted multiple times, the bonus does not stack, but each office must be revoked separately. |
| 19 | **Troops:** The lord sends a garrison of troops to serve under the vassal’s command. The gp value of the troops will be equal to at least 1gp per family in the vassal’s realm. The lord may specify where in the realm the troops are to be stationed or leave that to the vassal. The vassal is not responsible for paying the wages of the troops. The troops count as part of the garrison of whatever domains they are stationed in. This is an ongoing favor that can be extended multiple times. If the favor is revoked, the lord recalls his troops. It is usually counterbalanced by a demand for scutage. |
| 20 | **Grant of Land:** The vassal is granted an additional domain to add to his realm. The new domain will be at least equal to the size (in hexes) of the smallest of the vassal’s own vassal domains. If the vassal has no vassal domains below him, he is granted a domain consisting of 1 6-mile hex on the border of one of his existing domains. Generate the new domain normally, as per the rules above. The vassal may add the new domain to his personal domain or award it to a sub-vassal, as desired. |

**Calling to Arms:** When a lord calls his vassals to arms, it will take time for the troops to become available for his use. The time required is based on the size of the lord’s realm, as shown on the adjoining table. One half the requested troops (rounded up) will arrive within the first time period after the leader begins mustering troops. Another quarter (rounded down, minimum 1) will arrive during the second time period. The remainder of the troops becomes available in the third period. The lengthy amount of time required to muster troops by large realms is a major reason why many realms are divided into small domains with local forces that can respond to raids and skirmishes quickly. See **Armies** (p. XX) for more details.

**Scutage Demanded:** When a lord demands scutage, it will take time for the funds to become available for his use. The time is required is based on the size of the lord’s realm. One half the requested funds (rounded up) will arrive at the end of the first time period after the leader demands a tax. Another quarter (rounded down, minimum 1) will arrive at the end of the second time period. The remainder of the funds become available at the end of the third period. Scutage will thereafter arrive monthly until the duty is revoked. Because demanding scutage is cumbersome, lords typically avoid demanding scutage except to maintain standing armies (in which case it is an ongoing duty) or in cases of very special need.

**Standing Armies:** The Favor / Duty table assumes that “scutage” duties and “troops” favors are relatively rare edicts that represent special circumstances. However, some realms might be organized with a full-time standing army. A standing army would be represented in game with a combination of ongoing “scutage” duties and “troops” favors. The favors and duties even out; the rules put a standing army and feudal army on equal footing. A vassal can still have his own private troops even if he has a standing army paid for by his lord; it is not unusual for realms to include both standing armies and household forces. It is up to the Judge to determine if the standing army’s forces are under the command of the local ruler or have their own separate commanders.

EXAMPLE: The Tarkaun of the Auran Empire demands two “scutage” duties from all of his Exarchs, each of whom must therefore send him 2gp per family. (They in turn make the same demand of their Prefects, who demand it of their Palatines, etc.) The Empire has a population of 4,300,000 families, which yields scutage of 8,600,000gp. The Tarkaun spends this gold on the Auran Army, maintaining a force of 344,000 troops with wages of 8.6 million gp per month. He then uses “troops” favors to deploy these troops in the Empire. He provides many more troops to areas such as the Borderlands or the Kemeshi border, and many fewer troops to the safe interior of Tirenea. In the Auran Empire, domain rulers have both civil and military authority, so the legionaries of the Auran Empire are under the command of the local leaders where they are deployed.

###### Non-Henchman Vassals

Rather than assigning multiple vassal domains to a henchman who then has to sub-assign the vassal domain to his own henchmen, a ruler may **assign vassal domains** to **non-henchmen.** These may be NPC adventurers, mercenary commanders, specialists, etc. Non-henchmen rulers have a base loyalty of -2 instead of 0. If the non-henchman vassal’s domain is outside the range of trade of his ruler’s largest urban settlement, a non-henchman’s base loyalty is -4. (See ***ACKS II Judges Journal****,* p. XXX for details on range of trade.) During any month, a non-henchman vassal can only be safely asked to perform one duty for each favor given (there is no “free” duty, as there is with a henchman). If the ruler demands duties in excess of this total, the non-henchman vassal’s loyalty must be checked on the Henchman Loyalty table for each extra duty.

###### Tribute Inefficiency

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Number of Vassals** | **Tribute Received** |
| 16,384 or more | 1% |
| 4,096 – 16,384 | 5% |
| 1,025 – 4,095 | 10% |
| 217 – 1,024 | 20% |
| 64 – 216 | 33% |
| 17 – 63 | 50% |
| 9 – 16 | 66% |
| 8 or less | 100% |

Sometimes a ruler may conclude that he can increase his tribute by having many weak vassals. Since the per capita tribute is greater from a baron than a prince, for instance, a king might decide to have 400 barons instead of 4 princes as vassals. However, the more vassals a ruler maintains, the more difficult and expensive the collection of tribute becomes. Appraising the amount of tribute required, collecting it, transporting it, accounting for its receipt, and storing it are manual processes, each expensive by themselves and susceptible to loss from banditry, corruption, graft, and simple stupidity.

These inefficiencies are reflected by reducing the actual tribute received from vassals. Consult the Tribute Inefficiency table to assess how much a ruler actually receives. The “missing” tribute of course still exists in the economy but it’s not available to the ruler — it’s eaten up by crime, corruption, or waste.

EXAMPLE: Tarkaun Drakomir decides to purge all mid-tier nobles from the Auran Empire and rule his realm of 4,319,990 families by having 21,600 patricians with 200 families each owing 430gp in tribute, for a total of 9,288,000gp per month.

However, the massive inefficiencies of having 21,600 direct reports means he only gets 1% of that — 92,880gp per month. That’s much less than the 320,000gp he got by having exarchs! Tarkaun Drakomir goes broke and is overthrown. Later, he writes a memoir explaining that his efforts at popular rule were foiled by a military junta.

What if instead of replacing five exarchs with 21,600 patricians, Drakomir had gone with twenty prefects each with about 215,000 families?

He’d demand 27,000gp in tribute from each prefect, or 540,000gp. But he’d only get 50% of that, or 270,000gp, so he’s still worse off — he’s earning less, and he now has a dozen or more non-henchman vassals to worry about.

### Keeping the Peace

###### Base Morale Score

All domains have a morale scorewhich represent their populations’ trust and faith in their ruler. Domains begin with a **base morale score** of 0 plus or minus their ruler’s Charisma adjustment and certain modifiers based on the ruler’s personal authority, his stronghold, his domain classification, his garrison, and his religion. Base morale score only changes if the ruler’s Charisma adjustment, personal authority, stronghold, or garrison modifiers change. Round penalties up; round bonuses down.

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Modifier** | **Base Morale Score** | **Modifier** | **Base Morale Score** |
| Personal authority | By Level & Income | Insufficient stronghold | -1/-2/-3 |
| Leadership proficiency | +1 | Lawful/Chaotic ruler, Neutral domain | -1 |
| Neutral ruler, Chaotic domain | -1 | Neutral ruler, Lawful domain | -1 |
| Lawful ruler, Chaotic domain | -2 | Chaotic ruler, Lawful domain | -2 |
| Domain classified borderlands | -1 | Domain classified outlands | -2 |
| Additional troops in borderlands | +1 | Additional troops in outlands | +1/+2 |

**Personal Authority:** “Happy is the land whose king is a noble leader” is more than just a proverb. In times of peril and war, the commoners and nobility both demand leaders with the strength to protect their interests. Weak leaders will be marginalized, deposed, or slain. Of course, “strong” and “weak” are relative to the size of the realm. A strong baron may be a weak emperor. **Personal authority** measures the strength of the ruler relative to his domain and applies as a modifier to his domain’s **base morale score**. Cross reference the ruler’s class level with his domain income on the Personal Authority table.

EXAMPLE: Legate Ulrand Valerian is an 8th level fighter with CHA 13 who rules a domain with an income of 4,450gp per month. Cross-referencing his class level (8) with his domain income (4,450gp), the Judge finds that Valerian’s personal authority is 0. Combined with his Charisma bonus of +1, this gives his domain a base morale score of +1. If Legate Valerian were slain and his wife (a 0-level normal woman with CHA 16) took over, her personal authority modifier would be -4, which combined with her Charisma bonus of +2 would yield a base morale score of -2. (Assuming she remains in power, her XP from running the domain would advance her in level until she reached a personal authority of 0.)

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Class  Level | 25- | 26-  75 | 76-  150 | 151-  300 | 301-  600 | 601-  1,200 | 1,201-  2,400 | 2,401-  5,000 | 5,001-  10,000 | 10,001-  20,000 | 20,001-  45,000 | 45,001-  75,000 | 75,001-  150,000 | 150,001-  425,000 | 425,001+ |

| 14 | +4 | +4 | +4 | +4 | +4 | +4 | +4 | +4 | +4 | +4 | +3 | +2 | +1 | 0 | -1 |

**Designer’s Note:** Because of how the GP Threshold for campaign XP works in ***ACKS****,* a ruler of a realm will tend to advance in level of experience until he reaches a personal authority of 0, and then stop advancing. Most rulers will be just below, at, or just above that level, so Personal Authority for NPC realms can generally be assumed to average out to 0 (or roll 1d3-2). Specific calculations need be used only for PC realms or special situations such as young or inexperienced rulers, recent conquests, and so on.

**Leadership Proficiency:** If the ruler has the Leadership proficiency, his domain’s base morale score is increased by 1.

**Insufficient Stronghold:** A domain’s base morale score is decreased if its stronghold is insufficient. An insufficient stronghold is one whose value is below the minimum required to secure the territory of the domain. Apply a -1 modifier to base morale score if the stronghold value is at least half the minimum, by -2 if at least one quarter the minimum, and by -3 if less than one quarter the minimum. A stronghold that is damaged or destroyed by war can become insufficient for its domain.

**Domain Classification:** Domains on the frontier are less well-regulated, and prone to unruliness, disrespect for authority, and lawlessness. Borderlands domains suffer a -1 penalty to base morale, while outland domains suffer a -2 penalty to base morale. These penalties can be alleviated with additional troops.

**Additional Troops:** A strong garrison can reduce the lawlessness of borderland and outlands domains. A borderlands domain gains a +1 bonus to base morale if 1gp per peasant family of additional troops are garrisoned in the domain. An outlands domain gains a +1 bonus to base morale if 1gp per peasant family of additional troops are garrisoned in the domain, and a +2 bonus if 2gp per peasant family of additional troops are garrisoned in the domain.

**Alignment & Religion:** The inhabitants of a realm cannot tell what alignment their ruler is directly, so they will do so based on his apparent religious practices. A domain is considered to be Lawful if it is predominantly populated by humans and demi-humans who worship Lawful gods. In the Auran Empire setting, this would include the Auran Empire itself, Northern Argollë, Rorn, and Somirea. A domain is considered to be Chaotic if it is predominantly populated by beastmen or by any creatures who worship Chaotic gods. In the Auran Empire setting, this would include Celdorea and Kemesh. (Jutland and Skysostan, being shamanistic, are Neutral.) A domain’s religion (and hence its alignment) can be changed by the ruler but doing so is not easy — see **Introducing a New Religion**, below.

###### Current Morale Score

A domain’s **current morale score** may differ from its base morale score depending on the ruler’s decisions. Any change to a domain’s base morale score immediately changes its current morale score. In addition, at the end of each month, the Judge will roll 2d6 on the Domain Morale table, applying any relevant adjustments to the roll, to determine whether the domain’s morale has changed as a result of recent events. Round penalties up; round bonuses down. A natural roll of 2 always reduces current morale by 2, while a natural roll of 12 always increases current morale by 2.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Domain Morale** | |
| **Adjusted Die Roll** | **Result** |
| 2- | Morale reduced by 2 (min -4) |
| 3 – 5 | Morale reduced by 1 (min -4) |
| 6 – 8 | Morale shifts by 1 towards base |
| 9 – 11 | Morale increased by 1 (max +4) |
| 12+ | Morale increased by 2 (max +4) |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Monthly Events** | **Morale Roll Adjustment** |
| Garrison expenditure below 2gp/family this month | -1/gp below |
| Domain invaded and occupied by enemy army | 0, then -1 per month |
| Domain pillaged by enemy army | -4 |
| 1gp/family in troops repressing domain this month | +1\* |
| 2gp/family in troops repressing domain this month | +2\* |
| Additional troops repressing domain this month | +1#/gp above |
| Liturgy expense above 1gp/family this month | +1/gp above |
| Liturgy expense below 1gp/family this month | -1/gp below |
| Taxes above 2gp/family this month | -1/gp above |
| Taxes below 2gp/family this month | +1/gp below |
| Tithes not paid this month | -1 |
| Ruler introduces or maintains worship of god of different alignment this month | -4 |
| Ruler maintains worship of god of different alignment this month | -2 |
| Ruler administers domain | +1 |
| Calamity affects domain this month | Varies |

\* Current morale score cannot exceed 0 when repressed

**Invasion and Occupation**: A domain does not suffer an immediate penalty to its morale roll when it is invaded. As has been proven in countless wars throughout history, people are often stubbornly resilient in the defense of their homes. However, if the number of invading troops is sufficiently large enough to constitute an occupying garrison (see**Invading, Conquering, Occupying, and Pillaging Domains** on p. XX), and the invading army remains in the domain for more than a month, it begins to suffer a cumulative penalty of -1 per month on each morale roll, to a maximum of -4.

**Pillage:** If a domain is pillaged by an enemy army (see**Invading, Conquering, Occupying, and Pillaging Domains** on p. XX), it suffers a -4 penalty on its next morale roll. This penalty is in lieu of any penalty for occupation (they do not stack).

**Repressing Peasantry:** Rather than deploy its garrison on a military campaign outside the domain, a ruler may deploy some or all of the garrison to repress the peasantry. However, a militia cannot be deployed to repress the peasantry. A domain gains a +1 bonus to morale rolls if 1gp per family of additional troops is repressing the peasants, a +2 bonus if 2gp per family of additional troops is repressing the peasants, and an additional +1 bonus per full gp per family of additional troops repressing the domain. However, a repressed domain’s current morale score can never be higher than 0 (Apathetic).

**Introducing a New Religion:** A ruler can simply command his subjects to worship his god, creating vast congregations within his domain. Typically such commands shift the focus of a domain’s worship from one god to another of the same alignment. For instance, a lord might command his realm to emphasize worship Ianna, rather than Ammonar. This does not count as changing religion for morale purposes. However, demanding the worship a god of a different alignment is incredibly damaging to domain morale.

The domain suffers a -4 penalty to its morale rolls in the first month the new religion is introduced, and a -2 penalty thereafter until either the ruler allows the domain’s families to return to their old faith or until a majority of the domain converts to the new religion. Conversion occurs if the domain’s current morale reaches Stalwart (+4) or if the domain’s ruler or chaplain ever acquires congregants equal to more than half the domain’s population (see **Congregants and Divine Power**, p. XX).

**Administering the Domain:** If the ruler or his magistrate administered the domain that month, he gains a +1 bonus on that month’s domain morale roll. Administering the domain is a campaign activity discussed under **Ruling the Realm** (p. XX).

**Calamities:** Various vagaries and calamities can befall a domain in the course of play, ranging from plague to earthquakes to magical transformation of the land into a living hellscape (as happened to the domain of Detroit, Michigan). The Judge can impose a penalty on the domain’s morale rolls based on calamities that occur. A minor calamity that causes property damage inflicts a -1 penalty. A major calamity that causes substantial property damage and loss of life inflicts a -2 to -3 penalty. An utter catastrophe (such as a *cataclysm* or *plague* ritual) inflicts a -4 penalty. (Since tracking the floods, droughts, and plagues of NPC domains is a lot of work, and given that calamities were commonplace in history, the Judge can just assume a default of -1 for NPC domains each month if desired.)

EXAMPLE: Marcus, a Lawful 9th level fighter with CHA 13, is ruler of a domain with 1,200 families with an income of 14,000gp per month. This gives him a personal authority modifier of 0. His stronghold is of standard value. His garrison of 40 heavy cavalry costs 2,400gp per month, the required amount. His domain is within the Auran Empire and its people, like Marcus, worship the Empyrean gods, so there is no modifier for religion. Therefore his domain has a base morale score of +1 (Loyal). After several months of good rulership, his domain has a current morale score of +2.

However, after accidentally donning a **helm of alignment change**,Marcus becomes Chaotic and starts worshipping the chthonic gods. His new alignment reduces his domain’s base morale by 2, to -1. The change in base morale score immediately reduces the domain’s current morale score from +2 to 0. Worse, the newly villainous Marcus decides to start running his domain with an iron fist. He pays no tithes (-1) and raises taxes from 2gp to 4gp per peasant (-2). At the end of the month, he makes a domain morale roll of 2d6-3 for his domain’s loyalty. He rolls a 5, which after adjustment results in a 2. That means his domain’s current morale score drops by 2 points, from 0 to -2, to Turbulent.

The next month, Marcus decides to deploy his entire garrison of 40 heavy cavalry to repress the domain. He uses the additional 2,400gp of taxes he’s charging to hire 40 mercenary heavy cavalry to repress as well. The domain’s morale roll is modified by +2 because the entire garrison is repressing the peasants, with an additional +2 from spending an extra 2gp per family to repress the peasants. He continues to pay no tithes (-1) and continues to charge high taxes (-2). At the end of the month, he makes a domain morale roll of 2d6+ 4- 3 for his domain’s loyalty; the result is an 8. His domain’s current morale score shifts one point towards its base morale score of -1. Had Marcus not deployed troops to repress the peasants, his die roll would have had a modified result of 4, and his domain’s current morale score would have dropped by one point, from -2 to -3.

Marcus decides to change his approach. He reduces taxes back to 2gp per peasant (0). He introduces the Chthonic faith to his domain (-4), to which he pays tithes (0), but then spends an extra 2gp per peasant family on liturgies to introduce them to their new religion (+2). He continues to repress them with his garrison and mercenaries (+4). He rolls 2d6+6-4 and gets a 9. His domain’s current morale score now increases to 0.

In order to convert the peasants of his domain to his new faith, he must raise its morale to +4. However, a domain cannot have a morale greater than 0 if it is being repressed. Marcus therefore relinquishes his mercenaries and orders his cavalry back to their barracks. He maintains taxes at 2gp per peasant (0), continues to proselytize the Chthonic faith (-2), and increases his liturgy expenditure to 5gp per peasant family (+5). He rolls 2d6+ 5- 2 and gets a 10. His domain’s current morale score now increases to +1.

If Marcus is eventually able to raise his domain’s morale to Stalwart (+4), he will have successfully introduced the new religion into his domain and converting its alignment to his own. This will increase his base morale to +1 and alleviate the ongoing -2 penalty to his morale rolls.

###### Effects of Morale

A domain’s current morale scores affects its functioning as described below.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Effects of Current Morale** | |
| **Morale Score** | **Morale Level** |
| -4 | Rebellious |
| -3 | Defiant |
| -2 | Turbulent |
| -1 | Demoralized |
| 0 | Apathetic |
| +1 | Loyal |
| +2 | Dedicated |
| +3 | Steadfast |
| +4 | Stalwart |

**Rebellious** means that the domain is revolting against their ruler. All rolls on the Vagaries of Recruitment tables are at -20. All vassal loyalty rolls are at -2 due to the ruler’s uneasy grip on power. There is no population growth, and an extra 4d10 families per thousand are lost to illness, casualties, and emigration each month. Conscripts and militia cannot be levied. The able-bodied men (one per family) become bandits, and begin to attack officials, trade caravans, troops, and travelers in the domain. With no workers, the domain’s tax, land, trade, and service income drop to zero. Each month there is a cumulative 10% chance that an NPC emerges from the ranks of the bandits to challenge the character’s rule. The NPC will have a level of experience sufficient to grant him a personal authority of +0.

**Defiant** means that the domain’s inhabitants have become violently unhappy with their ruler. This unhappiness manifests in banditry, tax evasion, and disloyalty. All rolls on the Vagaries of Recruitment tables are at -10. All vassal loyalty rolls are at -1. An extra 3d10 families per thousand are lost to illness, casualties, and emigration each month. Conscripts and militia cannot be levied. Tax, land, trade, and service income are halved as one able-bodied man per two families becomes a bandit, as above. Each month there is a cumulative 5% chance that an NPC emerges from the ranks of the bandits to challenge the character’s rule.

**Turbulent** means that the domain is in a state of dissatisfaction and unrest. All rolls on the Vagaries of Recruitment tables are at -5. An extra 2d10 families per thousand are lost to illness, casualties, and emigration each month. Conscripts and militia cannot be levied. Tax, land, trade, and service income is reduced by 20% as one able-bodied man per five families becomes as a bandit, as above. Each month there is a cumulative 1% chance that an NPC emerges from the ranks of the bandits to challenge the character’s rule.

**Demoralized** means that the domain’s populace sees their ruler as worse than average. An extra 1d10 families per thousand are lost to illness, casualties, and immigration each month. Conscripts and militia levied from the domain suffer a -1 decrease to their morale scores.

**Apathetic** means that the domain’s populace sees their ruler as just another petty noble. They work the land, pay their taxes, and do their duty, but have no special love for their ruler. Conscripts and militia levied from the domain suffer a -1 decrease to their morale scores.

**Loyal** means that the domain’s ruler is respected and popular with his subjects. Spies and thieves operating against the domain suffer a -1 penalty to their proficiency throws (see **Hijinks**,below). The population grows by an extra 1d10 families per thousand each month.

**Dedicated** means that the domain’s populace has been inspired to strong loyalist sentiment by their ruler. Spies and thieves operating against the domain suffer a -2 penalty to their proficiency throws. The population grows by an extra 2d10 families per thousand each month. All rolls on the Vagaries of Recruitment tables are at +5.

**Steadfast** means that the domain’s inhabitants hail their ruler as great leader deserving of strident support. The population grows by an extra 3d10 families per thousand each month. Spies and thieves operating against the domain suffer a -3 penalty to their proficiency throws. All rolls on the Vagaries of Recruitment tables are at +10. Conscripts and militia levied from the domain gain a +1 bonus to their morale scores. All vassal loyalty rolls are at +1.

**Stalwart** means that the domain’s populace acclaims their ruler as a beloved and righteous sovereign. The population grows by an extra 4d10 families per thousand each month. Spies and thieves operating against the domain suffer a -4 penalty to their proficiency throws. Conscripts and militia levied from the domain gain a +1 bonus to their morale scores. All rolls on the Vagaries of Recruitment tables are at +20. All vassal loyalty rolls are at +2 due to the ruler’s secure base of power.

###### Dealing with Bandits

Domains with current morale scores of -2 or less will be plagued by bandits. Bandits count as an enemy army, and if left unchecked, they can cause a domain’s current morale score to drop even further because of the cumulative penalty from enemy army occupation.

A ruler has two options to deal with bandits. He can attempt to defeat them with his troops, or he can attempt to increase his domain’s morale score. If ruler attacks and successfully defeats the bandits, the current morale of his domain is increased by 1, but the population of his domain is reduced by the number of bandits killed (e.g. killing 100 bandits reduces the population by 100 families). Bandits taken prisoner rather than killed can be freed and will return to work. If the domain’s morale is not at least -1 or better when the prisoners are freed, the appropriate percentage will return to banditry the following month.

EXAMPLE: Anárion rules a domain of 1,600 peasants. Due to some mismanagement, his domain’s morale slips to -3. One able-boded worker per two families becomes a bandit, leaving his domain with just 800 families while Anárion now find himself facing a veritable army of 800 bandits! He immediately takes to the field and defeats them, with 400 bandits killed and 400 captured. Anárion’s current domain morale increases from -3 to -2 because of the victory. He then restores the 400 prisoners to their lands, restoring his domain to 1,200 families. However, he unwisely neglects to take any other actions to increase his domain’s morale. The next month, his domain’s current morale remains -2, so one able-bodied worker per five families becomes a bandit. Since he has 1,200 families, that’s 240 bandits.

If the ruler manages to raise his domain’s morale score, the number of bandits is decreased accordingly without diminishing the population. For instance, a ruler who increases his domain’s morale score from -4 to -3 will reduce the number of bandits from one per family to one per two families, while a ruler who increases his domain’s morale score from -2 to -1 would reduce the number of bandits to zero. If an NPC emerges from the ranks of the bandits to challenge the character’s rule, he will offer battle at the first opportunity. If the ruler does not meet him in battle, the NPC will begin to loot or pillage the domain, imposing a -4 penalty on its morale rolls.

### Founding Settlements

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Total**  **Investment**  **(gp)** | **Maximum**  **Population**  **(families)** |
| 10,000 | 249 |
| 25,000 | 624 |
| 75,000 | 2,499 |
| 200,000 | 4,999 |
| 625,000 | 19,999 |
| 2,500,000 | 100,000 |

When a domain reaches its limit of growth, its ruler will normally secure an additional area of land to permit the population to grow. Instead of (or in addition to) doing so, he may choose to found an **urban settlement** within his domain. To found an urban settlement, a ruler must make an initial investment of 10,000gp and then move between 75 to 249 peasant families from his domain into the urban settlement.

Once established, an urban settlement functions much like a separate domain, except that the ruler can directly manage both his domain and the urban settlement within the domain. A ruler cannot directly manage a domain and an urban settlement located in a different domain, however.

###### Growing the Settlement

As with a domain, the ruler will make two die rolls of 1d10 per 1,000 families in the urban settlement each month to determine the change in the settlement’s population. If a character actively adventures at least once per month and keeps his urban settlement secure from threats, the settlement’s population will grow by an additional amount each month from immigration, using the Domain Population Growth table.

Unlike domains, the limits of an urban settlement’s growth are not based the available land. Instead, the limits are based on the extent of **urban investment**.Initially, the urban settlement is limited to less than 250 families. When the Total Investment shown on the table below is reached, the urban settlement expands to accommodate a greater maximum.

By spending more gold pieces on roads, aqueducts, sewers, marketplaces, walls, and other infrastructure, a ruler can increase the maximum population size of the urban settlement. In addition to increasing the maximum population, **urban investment** also attracts new residents. For every 1,000gp spent on investments in a month, the settlement will attract 1d10 new urban families. A ruler cannot spend more than his domain’s revenue on urban investment each month.

###### Collecting Revenue

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Settlement**  **Population**  **(families)** | **Trade**  **Revenue**  **(gp/family)** | **Market**  **Class** |
| 75 – 249 | 1 | Class VI |
| 250 – 499 | 1.5 | Class V |
| 500 – 2,499 | 1.5 | Class IV |
| 2,500 – 4,999 | 1.5 | Class III |
| 5,000 – 19,999 | 2 | Class II |
| 20,000 – 100,000 | 2.5 | Class I |

Each month, a ruler will collect revenue from each urban family in his domain. Like peasant families, urban families generate 4gp of service revenue and 2gp of tax revenue per month. (If the domain is levying higher or lower taxes, this will apply to the urban settlement.) Instead of land value, urban families generate trade revenue, representing tolls, duties, tariffs, rent, and other fees paid by the residents and itinerants to the ruler. Trade revenue begins at 1gp per family per month and increases with the size of the settlement. Rulers may also profit from taking advantage of the urban settlement as a market. Each urban settlement has a market class based on its size. See **Mercantile Ventures** for more details on markets.

###### Paying Expenses

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Expense** | **Monthly Cost** |
| Garrison | 2gp/family |
| Liturgies | 1gp/family |
| Tithes | 1gp/family |
| Upkeep | 1gp/family |
| Tribute | Special |

Settlement expenses are similar to domain expenses. Each month, the ruler must pay a garrison cost of 2gp per urban family, a liturgies expense of 1gp per urban family, an upkeep expense of 1gp per urban family, and a tithe of 1gp per urban family. If the ruler is paying higher or lower liturgies for the domain, apply the same value to the urban settlement.

**Tribute:** Urban families are added to the total in the realm for purposes of tribute.

**Upkeep Expenses:** Unpaid upkeep expenses reduce the total investment value of the urban settlement. If this results in the settlement dropping to a lower market class, any excess urban families emigrate in search of better economic conditions and are lost.

###### Keeping the Peace

Urban settlements share the base and current morale score of the domain within which they are located; they do not have a separate morale score. Add the urban settlement’s income to the domain income to determine the ruler’s personal authority modifier.

###### Dissolution of an Urban Settlement

Urban settlements depend on a large population to support the necessary division of labor. If fewer than 75 urban families are ever present in a settlement, the urban settlement dissolves into the hamlets of the peasantry and become peasant families. Remove the urban settlement and replace the urban families with peasant families in the nearby hexes.

###### Villages, Towns, and Cities Benchmarks

The Villages, Towns, and Cities table, below, shows the average monthly income, after expenses, of urban settlements of various sizes (excluding tribute). This table can be used to quickly determine the income generated by an urban settlement located within a domain, excluding tribute. Remember to add the number of urban families to the total in the realm for purposes of tribute!

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Villages, Towns, and Cities** | | |
| **Urban Settlement (families)** | **Monthly Income** | **Market Class** |
| Hamlets (74-) | 0gp | Class VI\* |
| Small Village (75 – 99) | 150 – 199gp | Class VI |
| Village (100 – 159) | 200 – 319gp | Class VI |
| Village (160 – 249) | 320 – 624gp | Class VI |

| Metropolis (20,000 – 39,999) | 70,000 – 139,999gp | Class I |
| Metropolis (40,000+) | 140,000+ | Class I |
| \*Class VI market at domain’s stronghold only | | |

### Ruling the Realm

An adventurer who has become the ruler of a domain or realm gains access to a number of campaign activities. Some campaign activities can be delegated to magistrates, who act in his place. The ruler or magistrate must be in the domain to undertake the activity.

**Administering Domain:** The tasks of a ruler are many and varied: holding court, passing laws, standing in judgment, presiding over assemblies of the people and nobility, erecting public works, drafting budgets, performing religious ceremonies, and more. These tasks are collectively referred to as administering a domain. Administering a domain is an ongoing dedicated activity that requires 1/2 x [ (number of 6 miles hexes in the ruler’s personal domain) + (number of vassals reporting to ruler) + (6 – market class of largest urban settlement in ruler’s personal domain) ] days to complete. Rulers who administer their domain gain a +1 bonus on domain morale rolls and a +5% bonus on domain XP that month. The ruler can delegate this activity to his steward.

**Inspecting Troops:** A ruler of at least 5th level with **Manual of Arms** proficiency can inspect troops under his command. Each company inspected counts as an ancillary activity. Troops that have been inspected by their commander gain a +1 bonus to their first attack throw within the next day. The ruler can delegate this activity to his captain of the guard.

**Issuing Decrees:** A domain rulerin his domain can issue a decree, changing the laws of his realm. Issuing a decree is an ancillary activity. Issuing decrees is the method by which various decisions get implemented in the game world, including:

* Changing the rate of taxes or liturgies within the character’s domain
* Granting a favor to a vassal
* Demanding a duty of a vassal
* Freeing a perpetrator caught committing a crime
* Ordering the construction of a new stronghold within the character’s domain
* Ordering agricultural or urban investment within the character’s domain

When giving favors, ordering construction, or ordering investment, the gp cost is immediately paid. (If desired, Judges may deduct the expense at a rate of 500gp per day, but this is usually more book-keeping than its worth.) Morale rolls triggered by demanding duties are rolled immediately. Funds from taxes or duties are received during the Revenue Collection sub-phase of the following month.

**Overseeing Investments:** A domain ruler can personally oversee agricultural or urban investment he has ordered there. Overseeing investment is an ongoing ancillary activity lasting 1 day per 500gp of investment. As workers perform better when inspired and supervised by their liege, the investment will attract 1d10+1 new families instead of the usual 1d10 per 1,000gp. The ruler can delegate this activity to his munerator.

**Overseeing Construction:** A domain ruler can personally oversee a construction project in his domain. Overseeing construction is an ongoing ancillary activity lasting until the project is complete. However, a character who supervises construction as a dedicated activity (see below) can oversee construction at the same time as an incidental activity. Laborers work harder when overseen by the domain ruler, so their construction rate is increased by 5%, or by 10% if the ruler is also supervising construction (see below). The bonus continues for as long as the character oversees construction. The ruler can delegate this activity to his munerator or steward.

**Overseeing Troop Training:** A domain ruler of at least 5th level with Manual of Armsproficiency can personally oversee the training of conscripts or militia he has called up (see p. XX). Overseeing training counts as one ongoing ancillary activity per 60 troops. The time required is based on the type of troop the men are being trained to become. Oversight must be maintained throughout the entire training time or the benefit is list. However, a character who trains troops as a dedicated activity (see below) can oversee training of those troops at the same time as a incidental activity. Troops whose training is overseen by their domain ruler receive a permanent +1 bonus to their morale score for as long as they remain in his service. The ruler can delegate this activity to his captain of the guard.

**Summoning the Senate:** A domain ruler of a senatorial republic (p. XX) can summon the senate to consult with him. Consulting the senate is a singular dedicated activity for each matter discussed by the senate. A ruler consulting the senate can issue decrees approved by the senate as an incidental activity. The ruler cannot delegate this activity.

**Supervising Construction:** A domain ruler with sufficient ranks of Engineering or Siege Engineering proficiency can serve as the construction supervisor for a construction project in his domain. Supervising construction is an ongoing dedicated activity lasting until the project is complete. A ruler supervising construction can oversee construction (see above) as an incidental activity. The ruler can delegate this activity to his munerator or steward, if he qualifies.

**Training Troops:** A domain ruler with sufficient ranks of Manual at Arms (and Riding and/or Weapon Focus where necessary) can serve as the marshaltraining up to 60 conscripts or militia (p. XX). Training troops is an ongoing dedicated activity. The time required is based on the type of troop the men are being trained to become. A ruler training troops can oversee training (see above) as an incidental activity. The ruler can delegate this activity to his captain of the guard, if he qualifies.

**Waging War:** A domain ruler can undertake a military campaign. Military campaigning is an ongoing strenuous dedicated activity. It is considered to begin when a character leads his army’s troops out of their garrisons, and end when the character returns his army’s troops to garrison or hands over command. While waging war the ruler will have to pay for the cost of armorers, quartermasters, and supplies for his army, so waging war is a very expensive activity. See Chapters 8 – 11 for comprehensive rules on waging war. The ruler can delegate this activity to his captain of the guard.

### Special Domain Types

The peoples of the world are many and varied, and so too are their political organizations. These rules supplement the earlier rules to allow the Judge to include other types of domains in his setting.

###### Barbarian Clanholds

Not every domain and realm is civilized and cosmopolitan. Many domains are made up of loose-knit collections of clans and tribes who eke out existence as pastoralists or horticulturalists. Clanholds are similar to ordinary domains, with the following special rules:

* Clanholds are always classified as outlands domains. They cannot exceed 125 peasant families per 6-mile hex and 2,000 per 24-mile hex. Clanhold peasants subsist through simple horticulture, local pastoralism, and foraging. They do not rotate their crops, irrigate their fields, terrace their hills, or practice the other land improvements that civilizations use to intensively cultivate land. As a result the population density of clanholds is limited.
* Clanhold families consists of one warrior and one or more noncombatants, including woman, young, elderly, and/or thralls.
* Provided the chieftain actively adventures or raids at least once per month, his clanhold’s population will grow by an additional amount each month, determined by the number of families already present. Use the table on p. XX*,* but treat the clanhold as if it were two population categories smaller than an equivalent human domain, so it grows faster.
* Clanhold settlements are limited to less than 250 urban families (Market Class VI). They cannot be increased in size or market class with urban investment. At no time can the number of urban families in a clanhold exceed 12.5% of the peasant population of the clanhold.
* Clanhold chieftains cannot conscript peasants or levy a militia from their domain like ordinary rulers (see p. XX). Instead, clanhold chieftains can **levy clanhold warriors**, up to 1 warrior per family (see p. XX).
* Because of their primitive political structures, clanhold chieftains are limited in the favors they can offer and duties they can demand of their vassals. Chieftains cannot **call to council***,* except for purposes of war, and cannot**demand****loans**at all. They cannot offer **charters****of****monopoly**or**grants****of****title***.* When chieftains **call****to****arms** they can call for half the available clan warriors as one favor, or all clan warriors as two favors.
* Clanhold chieftains can establish realms either by founding additional clanholds and assigning them to a henchman to manage, or by conquering and annexing an existing domain (see Chapter 10). Clanhold chieftains can offer and demand the full range of favors and duties from their ordinary vassal domains . However, ordinary (e.g. civilized) human and demi-human domains subjected to clanhold rule reduce their base morale score by 2 points, in addition to any penalty from alignment.
* Clanholds can be added to the realms of ordinary rulers. The clanhold domain(s) and ordinary domain(s) follow the rules for their domain type. The ruler can only offer and demand the full range of favors and duties from his ordinary vassal domains, but can only offer and demand the favors and duties available to clanhold chieftains from his clanhold vassals.

Beastmen domains are always barbarian clanholds unless ruled by a chaotic human or monster ruler of great power and intelligence (discussed below). Some human domains and realms are also clanholds. In the Auran Empire campaign setting, clanholds are primarily found in Skysostan, the northern regions of Jutland, and the western portions of the Ivory Kingdoms. At the Judge’s discretion, a barbarian or shaman might establish a clanhold instead of an ordinary domain.

###### Transitional Domains

A **transitional domain** is half-way between a clanhold and ordinary (civilized) domain. It represents the liminal stage when clan-based society begins to develop complex social hierarchies, enact formal laws, establish larger settlements, and achieve stable governance.

A clanhold domain can become a transitional domain if it meets the following criteria:

* The ruler is a human, demi-human or sapient monster other than a beastman;
* The ruler rules an urban settlement of at least 150 families; and
* Either the domain is adjacent to an ordinary domain, the ruler rules a realm with one or more civilized or transitional vassal domains, or the ruler is the vassal of a civilized or transitional domain.

The ruler decides if and when the clanhold domain becomes a transitional domain. The decision is made by issuing a decree (p. XX). Once made, the decision is irrevocable, as the formerly robust and hardy clanhold warriors soon grow soft and fat on the spoils of civilization and abandon the ways of their ancestors.

Transitional domains function like clanholds, with the following exceptions:

* A transitional domain can be civilized, but only if within 24 miles of a city or large town in the same realm. A transitional domain can be borderlands, but only if within 48 miles of civilized areas in the same realm.
* A transitional domain can exceed 125 peasant families per 6-mile hex, but the excess peasant families provide only half the normal land revenue.
* An urban settlement in a transitional domains is not limited to 250 families or 12.5% of the peasant population, and can be increased in size or market class. However, the value of investment in transitional domains is halved, e.g. it takes 2,000gp to attract 1d10 new families and 50,000gp to achieve market class V. In addition, trade revenue cannot exceed 1gp per family regardless of the settlement population.
* The ruler of a transitional domain can levy militia and conscript troops, but cannot call clanhold warriors. He can offer and demand the full range of favors and duties available.
* Ordinary human and demi-human domains subject to a transitional domain do not suffer the special -2 penalty to morale since the ruler isn’t a mere barbarian.

EXAMPLE: Raknar once ruled a clanhold domain consisting of 10 6-mile hexes. After he became a vassal of Moruvai, a Zaharan ruinguard who rules a flourishing realm, he decreed that his clanhold become a transitional domain. Moruvai’s domain has a large town within 48 miles of Raknar’s domain, so Raknar’s domain became classified as a borderlands domain,. As a borderlands domain, Raknar’s realm could have up to 250 families per 6-mile hex. Through time and investment, Raknar has reached this limit in each of his 10 hexes, so he has 2,500 orc peasant families. The 126th – 250th peasant families in each hex provide only half the normal land value. Raknar has also invested 50,000gp so that his domain can have a class V urban settlement; it currently has 400 orc urban families. Raknar’s monthly revenue is {[ 1,250 x (6 + 4 + 2)] + [1,250 x (3 + 4 + 2)]} from his peasant families and (400 x 7) from his urban families, for a total of 15,000gp + 11,250gp + 2,800gp = 29,050gp. Now that he rules a transitional domain, Raknar can conscript troops, levy militia, and accept ordinary vassals without a morale penalty, but can no longer directly call on clanhold warriors

A transitional domain can be converted to an ordinary domain once it has been a transitional domain for at least 20 years.

###### Dwarven Vaults

A dwarf of 9th level and above will soon attract dwarven followers appropriate to his class as well as a number of dwarven peasant families when he claims or constructs a vault. A dwarf of below 9th level who claims or construct a vault will attract followers and peasants when he attains 9th level.

A vault is a special stronghold built underground. While it may include above-ground gates, walls, or structures as necessary for defense or commerce, these cannot constitute more than 25% of the gp value of the stronghold. Any above-ground structures must be of earth or stone. A vault can only be constructed within the territory of a dwarven realm or in unclaimed wilderness territory. A stronghold built in human or elven territory, or built above ground, does not qualify.

Dwarves have a martial tradition in which many of the menfolk serve in a militia. Vault rulers can call up to 2gp per family of trained militia, which arrive equipped as light infantry (see p. XX). If they need additional troops, however, vault rulers can only garrison their domains with dwarven troops. They can hire and deploy human or elven troops but those troops do not count for the domain’s morale score.

Dwarven vaults otherwise function like human strongholds for all other purposes. Players and Judges interested in robust rules for dwarven mining, mushroom farming, eldermoots, and other mechanics should consult ***By This Axe: The Cyclopedia of Dwarven Civilization***.The domain rules in that book are 100% compatible with those of ***ACKS II***.

###### Elven Fastnesses

An elf of 9th level and above will soon attract elven followers appropriate to his class as well as a number of elven peasant families when he claims or constructs a fastness. An elf of below 9th level who claims or construct a fastness will attract followers and peasants when he attains 9th level.

A fastness is a special stronghold built harmoniously within a site of natural majesty. Fastnesses might be erected at the summit of a great peak, in the branches of a mighty tree, or behind a towering waterfall, but not at the foot of medium-sized hill in an unimpressive scrubland. A fastness can only be constructed within the territory of an existing elven realm or in unclaimed wilderness territory. A stronghold built in human or dwarven territory, or built at a site lacking suitable majesty, does not qualify.

The advantage of a fastness is that it brings the elves who dwell there into closer harmony with nature. All ordinary animals within 3 miles of the fastness (i.e. in its 6-mile hex) will be friendly to the elven residents. The elves will be able to communicate with the animals as if affected by *speak with beasts*, and the animals will warn of approaching strangers, carry news of events, deliver short messages to nearby places, etc. As a result, spies and thieves operating against the domain suffer a -2 penalty to their proficiency throws (see **Hijinks**,below). However, in exchange for this assistance, an elven ruler must always defend the animals within this territory.

The long lifespan of the elves gives many adults an opportunity to pursue military training. Fastness rulers can call up to 2gp per family of trained militia, which arrive equipped as light infantry (see p. XX). If they need additional troops, however, fastness rulers can only garrison their domains with elven troops. If they use any dwarven or human troops to garrison it, they lose the friendship of the local wildlife until they cease doing so. Fastness rulers can freely use mercenaries of any race for offensive operations outside the domain, and can hire and retain specialists and henchmen of any race. Elven fastnesses are otherwise maintained like human domains.
