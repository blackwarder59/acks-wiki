## Sea Vessels

When adventuring at sea, characters sail or row on **sea vessels**. Some vessels are small, and they can be steered by an adventuring party. Others require a great number of sailors or rowers to crew them.

**Crew** indicates the number of sailors, rowers, and/or marines a vessel can carry. Each vessel must be crewed by one or more sailors and rowers in order to move under sail or under oars. The number listed for sailors and rowers is a full complement of crew. Vessels with fewer crew move slower (see p. XX). The number listed for marines is the maximum number of marines that can be carried on deck. Crew do not count against a vessel’s cargo capacity, but rations for crew do (see p. XX).

**Combat Speed** is the distance the vessel can travel in one combat round. *Oar Sprint* demands maximum exertion from the rowers and cannot be maintained for more than 1 turns (10 rounds). *Oar Cruise* is a fast pace that can be sustained for one hour (6 turns). *Oar Slow* is an easy pace that can be maintained by the rowers indefinitely. *Sail* is the vessel’s speed under favorable winds at full sail.

**Voyage Speed** is the distance in miles the vessel can travel in a 12-hour day of sailing or rowing. Voyage speed under oar is much slower than combat speed but can be maintained indefinitely. Travel speed under sail can be greatly affected by wind direction and strength. 1.5- and 2.5-rower galleys are designed to use oars to assist their sail speed if their sails are up, but do not so when cruising long distances. Therefore their relative sail combat speed is higher than voyage speed.

If a 2-, 3-, 4-, 6-, or 8-rower galley has its main mast stowed on board, its oar sprint speed and oar cruise speed are reduced by 30’ per round because there’s not enough room for the rowers to work. If a 2-, 3-, 4-, 6-, or 8-rower galley travels under sail without its main mast, its sail speed is reduced by 30’ per round and its sail voyage speed by 15 miles per day. 1.5- and 2.5-rower galleys do not face these difficulties.

**Cargo** is the carrying capacity of the vessel. The weight of crew do not count against cargo. Passengers can be carried as cargo at a weight of 50 stone each. Conversely, 50 st of cargo can be carried in lieu of each crew member.

**AC** indicates the armor class of the vessel.

**Structural Hit Points** (SHP) are the vehicular equivalent of hit points for creatures. When a vessel reaches 0 or less shp, it will sink in 1d10 rounds. Attacks by man-sized or large creatures cannot deal damage to vessels. Light and medium ballista deal 1/10 damage to vessels. Huge creatures, heavy ballista, and light catapults deal 1/3 to vessels. All other artillery, gigantic creatures, and colossal creatures deal full damage to vessels. Spells deal 1/10damage to wooden structures, increased if the spell has an area of effect by a factor of (AOE square footage / 25). (Some spells deal more damage to wooden structures, as noted in their description.)

See **Vessels** and **Vessel Descriptions** in Chapter 4 for more information about each type of vessel.
