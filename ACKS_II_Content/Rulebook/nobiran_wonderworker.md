## Nobiran Wonderworker

Key Attribute: WIL

Requirements: STR 11, INT 11, WIS 11, DEX 11, CON 11, CHA 11

Hit Dice: 1d4

Maximum Level: 10

Nobirans are wise, contemplative, and ancient. They typically stand 3 ½' tall and weigh about 60 lbs, with dusky skin and graying hair. While they prefer a life of peace and learning, the evil deeds of others repeatedly draw them from their contemplative states to acts of heroism. Nobiran wonderworkers represent this noblest tradition of their people. They are mystics and sages who use the divine gifts to overcome their physical frailties, whether through summoning allies, healing their party, or confounding their foes.

### Starting Class Powers

At the start of play, nobiran wonderworkers have the following class powers.

**Divine Magic:** Nobiran wonderworkers can cast powerful divine spells. The number and levels of spells the wonderworker can cast in a single day are listed on the Nobiran Wonderworker Spell Progression table. Nobiran wonderworkers select spells from the divine spell list. Each morning a wonderworker must **prepare** the spells he desires to cast that day, including multiple copies of the same spell if desired. Once cast, a prepared spell cannot be cast again until it is prepared again. Wonderworkers can prepare any spell on their spell list of the spell level(s) he is entitled to cast, subject to his Wisdom bonus, if any. The number of spells the wonderworker can prepare increases based on his Wisdom bonus. More information on casting spells and individual spell descriptions can be found in the **Spells** chapter.

**Fighting the Supernatural:** Nobiran wonderworkers are especially capable in battle against the unnatural creatures that lurk in the darkness. They can **turn undead** with a successful turn undead result on 2d6. Against most undead, a result of 7+ destroys or drives off the creatures. More powerful undead may require higher die results. Additionally, nobiran wonderworkers gain a +1 bonus to all attack throws and damage rolls when fighting supernatural creatures (including undead, demons, devils, lycanthropes, enchanted creatures, and constructs, but not merely monsters, dragons, and giants). This bonus increases to +2 at 4th level and +3 at 8th level.

**Lore:** The wonderworker has studied the history, legends, and lore of his people. The Nobiran wonderworker's ability to decipher treasure maps, recall legends, identify historic sites and ruins, recognize obscure artifacts, and similar tasks is treated as having Loremastery proficiency. The proficiency throw is 14+ at first level, 13+ at 3rd level, 12+ at 5th level, 11+ at 7th level, and 10+ at 9th level. (This class power is the equivalent of Loremastery proficiency, but it cannot be selected again.)

**Peaceful Intent:** The wonderworker is trained in the peaceful ways of the Nobiran people. He can treat with most mortal intelligent creatures without risk of being immediately attacked. This class power does not work on magical creatures or animals. The attitude of encountered creatures is generally improved one step (e.g. from unfriendly to neutral, or neutral to friendly). (This class power is equivalent to Diplomacy proficiency.)

### Additional Class Powers

When they advance in level, nobiran wonderworkers gain the following additional class powers:

**Monastery (2nd level):** By building or acquiring a monastery, the nobiran wonderworker can attract monks to his service. The total value of the buildings and such must be at least 2,500gp. Once the wonderworker has acquired a monastery and reached 2nd level, 1d6 1st level nobiran monks will arrive to serve. If hired, the monks must be paid standard rates for henchmen. (See the **nobiran monk** class in ACKS II Player's Companion.)

**Command the Faithful (7th level):** Nobiran wonderworkers gain the ability to inspire great devotion amongst the truly faithful. When fighting alongside nobiran followers of his own alignment, the followers gain a +1 bonus to attack throws and saving throws, +1 to morale (if monsters or NPCs), and become immune to **fear** and **charm** effects. In addition, nobiran followers of his alignment within a radius of 60' of the wonderworker gain the same bonuses, even if not directly under his command. An evil (opposed alignment) character who attacks a wonderworker with this power in action must save v. Spells or be unable to attack the wonderworker that round.

**Protection from Evil (8th level):** Once per day, the nobiran wonderworker can cast **protection from evil** on himself (only) as if it were a 1st level spell that he had prepared. This ability is in addition to any prepared spells. When cast using this ability, **protection from evil** also grants the wonderworker a **sanctuary** effect equivalent to the spell of the same name, usable at will.

### Racial Traits

As nobirans, wonderworkers have certain powers and drawbacks associated with their race.

**Acute Hearing:** Nobirans have better than average hearing. They have a 1-in-6 chance to hear noises (on 1d6).

**Nobiran Courage:** Nobirans gain a +1 bonus to all saving throws.

**Nobiran Luck:** Once per day when making any d20 roll, a nobiran can "call upon the luck of the little people" to re-roll the die. The character must accept the new result (even if it's worse than the original).

**Small Target:** Nobirans gain a +1 bonus to Armor Class against attacks from large-sized or larger opponents due to their small size.

**Nobiran Tongues:** Nobirans can speak the Common, Nobiran, Elven, and Gnomish languages.

### Class Proficiencies

**Proficiency Progression:** At 1st level, nobiran wonderworkers select one class proficiency from their class proficiency list and one general proficiency from the general proficiency list. They select an additional class proficiency at 3rd, 6th, and 9th level. They select an additional general proficiency at 4th and 8th level.
