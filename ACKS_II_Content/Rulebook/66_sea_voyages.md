## Sea Voyages

Adventures on the high seas are called **voyages** and can challenge the characters with lacerating weather, sea monsters, and enemy vessels.

### Sailing the Seas

Speeds when traveling at sea are based on the type of vessel employed, the type of movement, and by the weather conditions. There are two types of movement, movement **under oar** and movement **under sail**. Movement under oar is less effected by the vagaries of wind direction. Movement under sail is faster over long distances than oar with favorable winds, but slower — much slower — when wind is unfavorable.

The voyage speeds listed on the Sea Vessels table are based on rowing or sailing for 12 hours each day with favorable winds. If gameplay requires movement to be adjudicated by hour, a vessel can move 1/12 the listed speed each hour. (Note that this is different than for creatures, where expedition speeds are based on traveling for 8 hours each day; crewing a vessel is considered an unstrenuous activity, so it can be performed for 12 hours per day.)

EXAMPLE: A large sailing ship has a voyage speed of 72 miles per 12-hour sailing day. Therefore it moves 6 miles per hour.

Vessels under sail in open seas with a navigator and full crew onboard can travel for 24 hours each day. By doing so, the vessel can travel twice the listed distance each day, although its hourly voyage speed is unchanged. Vessels traveling along a coastline, vessels under oar, vessels with less than the required crew, and/or vessels without a navigator must anchor or beach each night.

EXAMPLE: A large sailing ship in open seas with a navigator and full crew can sail 24 hours per day. It still moves 6 miles per hour but it will journey 144 miles every 24 hours.

###### Wind Direction

Every 12 hours, the Judge will roll 1d12 to determine **wind direction**. Movement of vessels under sail varies depending on the wind direction. Vessels under oar are not significantly affected by wind direction unless wind speed is very strong (see below).

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **D12** | **Wind Direction** |
| 1 | Northerly |
| 2 | Northeasterly |
| 3 | Easterly |
| 4 | Southeasterly |
| 5 | Southerly |
| 6 | Southwesterly |
| 7 | Westerly |
| 8 | Northwesterly |
| 9 – 12 | Prevailing wind direction for this locale |

The prevailing wind direction in the region of the Auran Empire depends on season and geography. Near the southern coast of the Ammasaurëan Sea, the winds are easterly in the summer and southwesterly in the winter. Near the northern coast of the Ammasaurëan, the winds are westerly in the summer and northwesterly in the winter. In campaigns outside of the Auran Empire setting, the Judge will determine the prevailing wind direction.

The Point of Sail diagram shows the effect that wind direction has on a vessel’s speed under sail. The vessels used on the Ammasaurëan Sea have shallow draft and small or no keels, making them awkward to handle under sail unless running before the wind. Vessels that are sailing in the direction opposite the wind are doing so by **tacking** (called “zigzagging” by landlubbers) between close hauled points of sail. Tacking vessels are moving at x1/3 speed but the zigzagging course means that they only move 66% of that distance in the direction they intend.

EXAMPLE: Phaedra is commanding a sailing ship heading from Arganos to Aura. Her ship can sail 72 miles (12 hexes) per day. The first leg of her journey requires her to sail northwest along the southern coast. The Judge determines that the current wind direction is easterly. Using the Points of Sail diagram, the Judge sees that Phaedra’s vessel is broad reaching. Therefore she sails 72 x 2/3 = 48 miles over her 12-hour sailing day, for an average speed of 4mph. Had Phaedra been heading straight west, her ship would have been running before the wind and moved 72 miles over 12 hours. Had Phaedra been traveling straight east, her ship would have had to tack between close-hauled points, and would only progress 16 miles west over 12 hours, for an average speed of 1.5mph.

**Master Mariners:** If the captain of a vessel under sail is a master mariner (three ranks of Seafaring) and has a full crew, he can treat the point of sail as one point more favorable. For instance, if his vessel is close-hauled, his vessel moves as if on a beam reach (x1/2 speed). If a master mariner’s vessel is on a beam reach, it moves as if broad reaching (x 2/3 speed), and so on.

###### Wind Strength

Every 12 hours, the Judge will roll 2d6 to determine **wind strength**. Add +2 to the wind strength roll if sailing in winter, when storms are more likely. Movement of vessels can vary greatly depending on the wind strength.

|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **2d6** | **Wind Speeds** | **Sail Speed** | **Oar Speed** | **Next Day’s Wind** | **Special Effect** |
| **2, 3, 4** | Still | x0 | x1 | -2 | None |
| **5, 6** | Gentle | x1/2 | x1 | -1 | None |
| **7, 8, 9** | Moderate | x1 | x1 | 0 | None |
| **10, 11** | Strong | x 3/2 | x1 | +1 | Cannot tack unless master mariner |
| **12, 13** | Very Strong | x2/3 | x2/3 | +2 | Cannot tack, Windy conditions |
| **14** | Gale | x2/3 or 0 | x2/3 or 0 | +4 | Damaged or drift, Stormy conditions |

**Still:** There is no wind. Vessels under sail cannot move. Vessels under oar can move at full speed. The Judge will apply a -2 penalty to the next day’s wind strength roll.

**Gentle:** Vessels under sail can only move at 1/2 speed. Vessels under oar can move at full speed. The Judge will apply a -1 penalty to the next day’s wind strength roll.

**Moderate:** Vessels under sail and oar can move at full speed.

**Strong:** Vessels under sail can move at 3/2 speed when close-hauled, beam reached, broad reached, or running before the wind. They cannot tack unless captained by a master mariner; master mariners can tack at 2/9 speed under strong wind. Vessels under oar can move at full speed. The Judge will apply a +1 bonus to the next day’s wind strength roll.

**Very Strong:** Vessels under sail must shorten their sails. They can move at only 2/3 speed and cannot tack unless captained by a master mariner (as above). Vessels under oar can move at only 2/3 speed because of choppy, swelling seas. Weather conditions will be Windy. The Judge will add +2 to the next day’s wind strength roll.

**Gale:** Gales will initially appear to be very strong winds. The Judge will roll 1d12 to randomly determine at what hour of the sailing day the weather worsens into a gale. When a gale begins, sailing ships can lower their sails. If the vessel lowers its sails, the vessel does not move for the remainder of the day. If the vessel does not lower its sails, the vessel can move as if under Very Strong Winds, but it suffers 2d8 slashing structural damage per hour sailed.

The effects of gales are worse on galleys than on sailing ships. When a gale begins, and each hour thereafter, the galley’s captain must make a Seafaring proficiency throw of 11+ (7+ if master mariner). If the galley is carrying a boarding bridge, the captain suffers -6 penalty to his throw. If the throw succeeds, the galley takes 2d8 structural slashing damage and moves at 2/3 speed for one hour. If the galley reaches the coast, it can beach to avoid further damage. If the coastline is clear terrain, the galley can automatically beach, but if not, the galley’s navigator must make a Navigation proficiency throw of 14+. If the navigator either is or is serving under a master mariner, he adds a +4 bonus to his throw. If the throw succeed, the navigator finds a safe beach. If the throw fails, the navigator does not find a safe beach. The galley must successfully move at sea for another hour before the navigator can try again.

If the throw fails, the galley takes 4d8 structural slashing damage and then moves 1d6 miles in the direction of the wind. If this random movement is enough to plunge the galley onto a coast, reef, or other obstacle, it takes 2d6 x 10 shp damage and is beached.

Weather conditions during a gale will always be Rainy and Stormy (see p. XX). The Judge will apply a +4 bonus to the next day’s wind strength roll. If the winds remain at Gale strength for two or more days, the winds whip up huge, dangerous waves. Each hour at sea, there is a 5% chance that a vessel is struck by a *capsizing wave* (as the spell).

### Visibility at Sea

|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Feature  Perceived | Daylight | Full  Moonlight | Half  Moonlight | Starlight |
| Coastline | 12 miles | 6 miles | 3 miles | 1.5miles |
| Vessel | 6 miles | 3 miles | 1.5 miles | 4,000’ |
| Fire | 6 miles | 6 miles | 6 miles | 6 miles |
| Flying Creatures | 1,800’ | 900’ | 450’ | 225’ |
| Submerged Creatures | 120’ | 60’ | 30’ | 15’ |

The surface of the sea offers lines of sight that are unmatched on land… but the depths can conceal untold terrors. The Maximum Visibility Distance table shows the maximum visibility distance that adventurers can perceive features of their environment such as mountains, islands, ships, or creatures under varying light conditions. Weather conditions can reduce maximum visibility as usual: In Rainy conditions, maximum visibility distance is halved while in Foggy or Snowy conditions, maximum visibility distance is reduced to a flat 20’.

### Navigating the Seas

Navigating the seas has two components – staying on course and avoiding nautical hazards.

###### Staying on Course

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Terrain** | **Navigation** |
| Lake or River | 4+ |
| Coast | 7+ |
| Open Sea | 11+ |

Getting lost is easy to do in the trackless expanse of endless ocean. At the start of each day or night of travel, the Judge will make a Navigation proficiency throw on the vessel’s behalf, using the target values listed in the table below. If any member of the crew has the Pathfinding class power or the Navigation proficiency, the vessel receives a +4 bonus on this proficiency throw, or a +8 bonus if the crew collectively knows both Pathfinding and Navigation. As with all throws, if the Judge rolls an unmodified roll of 1, the Navigation throw automatically fails.

If the throw succeeds, the vessel does not become lost. If the throw fails, the vessel becomes lost. The Judge should adjust his description of the wind direction to reflect the direction the crew believes it is traveling until they figure out their mistake. The effects of getting lost at sea are otherwise identical to those of getting list in the wilderness (p. XX).

###### Avoiding Nautical Hazards

Nautical hazards include underwater or partially submerged rocks, coral reefs, kelp forests, sandbars, shoals, sunken wrecks, and whirlpools. The Judge will determine the location of nautical hazards on a hex by hex basis on his map. Unless the hazard is a recent development, characters with Navigation and Seafaring proficiency will know about the hazards on common routes and can simply sail or row around them. Traveling into uncharted waters is much more dangerous.

When a vessel enters a hex containing a nautical hazard, the captain must make a Seafaring proficiency throw of 11+ (7+ if master mariner). If the vessel is moving at half speed or less, the captain gains a +4 bonus. If the vessel is a galley or longship, the captain gains +4 if navigating sandbars/shoals. If the throw succeeds, the vessel safely traverses the hex. If the throw fails, the vessel runs into the hazard, suffering the effects described below. The Judge can devise other nautical hazards for his setting. The suggestions for spells to escape nautical hazards are just that and are not intended to be an exclusive list of the ways a vessel might benefit from magic.

**Kelp Forest:** The vessel is entangled in seaweed. It cannot move until it is disentangled. Disentangling the vessel requires 1d4 hours plus an additional hour per 60 tons the vessel weighs. Spells such as *plant shrinkage*, *disintegration,* or *dominate plants* can instantly disentangle the vessel.

**Rock/Reef/Wreck:** The vessel strikes the hazard below the waterline and suffers 8d10 structural piercing damage. If the vessel was traveling at half speed or less when it entered the hex, damage is halved.

**Sandbar/Shoal:** The vessel runs aground and suffers 4d10 structural bludgeoning damage. If the vessel was traveling at half speed or less when it entered the hex, damage is halved. The vessel cannot move until it is refloated by high tide in 1d12 hours (Judge’s discretion) or until the vessel is freed from the shoal. The crew can attempt to free the vessel by lightening its load or by rocking it back and forth to dislodge it. Lightening the load grants a cumulative 5% chance the vessel escapes for every 200 st of cargo thrown overboard. Each crew member can unload 33 st of cargo per turn (200 st per hour). Rocking the vessel back and forth requires the entire crew to work at shifting ballast and cargo back and forth through the hold. Rocking the vessel grants a 5% cumulative chance per turn that the vessel escapes, but each time the roll fails the vessel suffers 1d4 structural bludgeoning damage. *Force of impetus* can dislodge the vessel immediately but deals 4d10 structural damage to it. *Earth’s movement* can dislodge the vessel in one turn.

**Whirlpool:** The vessel is sucked into a whirling maelstrom of water with spouting upswelling fountains and swirling vortices of depressed water. When the vessel enters the whirlpool, and at the end of each round that it remains in the whirlpool, it suffers 25-40 (1d4+4 x 5) structural bludgeoning damage and each crew member on deck must succeed on a Paralysis saving throw or be thrown overboard and must swim or drown. Swimming proficiencies suffer a -8 penalty in a whirlpool. On the captain’s initiative, he can make a Seafaring proficiency throw to steer out of the whirlpool. The target value is based on the vessel’s speed, as if targeted by a *capsizing wave* (p. XX). If the captain’s proficiency throw succeeds, the vessel escapes. If the captain’s proficiency throw fails, the vessel does not escape that round.

**Designer’s Note:** The rules above are intended to simulate the dangerous whirlpools that ancient mariners believed existed and those described in literature such as ***The Odyssey***,***A Descent into the Maelstrom***,and ***20,000 Leagues Under the Sea***.Actual whirlpools aren’t nearly as exciting.

### Surviving the Seas

Each day characters on a voyage must consume a daily ration of food and drink weighing a total of one stone, consisting of 2 lbs of food (1/ 6 st) and 1 gallon (5/6 st) of water. The total encumbrance of the rations carried is deducted from the vessel’s cargo capacity.

Characters that do not get their daily rations can become underfed, starving, and/or dehydrated. A vessel manned by underfed crew moves at half speed under oar or sail. A vessel crewed by starving or dehydrated crew moves at 1/3 speed under oar or sail. Becoming starved or dehydrated is a calamity that triggers morale rolls for the crew, posing a risk of mutiny!

###### Fishing

Characters at sea can fish each day that their vessel is becalmed or otherwise anchored. Fishing for food is a dedicated activity. For each day dedicated to fishing, each character can attempt a Fishing proficiency throw of 14+. A character with the Survival proficiency gains a +4 bonus on his Fishing proficiency throw. If the throw succeeds, the character brings in 1 stone of fish, i.e. enough to feed 6 man-sized creatures. (If the ship is in a rich fishing ground, fishing can gather much more food; see ***ACKS II Judges Journal***p. XX.)

###### Scurvy

Since standard rations spoil after one week, vessels on long sea voyages typically carry iron rations. After one month eating iron rations or caught fish, characters become **scurvy.** Scurvy characters lose 1 point of STR and CON immediately and another point of STR and CON each week thereafter. If either attribute reaches zero, the character dies. A scurvy character regains 1 point of STR and CON each day he eats a full ration of fresh food. Each time crewmembers lose points of STR and CON to scurvy, it counts as a calamity for their morale.

### Weathering the Seas

The Judge determines the prevailing weather for each day of the voyage. The effects of weather are in addition to any caused by wind direction and wind strength. Spells such as *control weather*, *control winds*, and *summon weather* can be invaluable to voyagers confronting bad weather.

###### Cold Temperatures

Cold temperatures do not affect the speed of vessels. They have their usual effect on characters. Characters below decks or in deckcastles or towers count as having protective clothing.

###### Hot Temperatures

Hot temperatures do not affect the speed of vessels. They have their usual effect on characters.

###### Foggy Conditions

Foggy conditions might occur when the wind strength is Still or Gentle. Foggy reduce the speed of vessels near a coast by half but do not affect speed in open sea. Foggy conditions drop visibility to 20’. Navigation proficiency throws suffer a -4 penalty in foggy conditions.

###### Rainy Conditions

Rainy conditions will occur anytime the wind strength is Gale, and might occur at other times. Rainy conditions drop visibility at sea by half. Navigation proficiency throws suffer a -2 penalty in rainy conditions. Rainy conditions have their usual effect on characters. However, characters below decks or in deckcastles or towers count as having shelter from the rain.

###### Snowy Conditions

Snowy conditions are rarely encountered at sea. If they occur, they drop visibility to 20’ and reduce the speed of vessels by half. Snowy conditions have their usual effect on characters, except those except those below decks or in deckcastles or towers count as having shelter from the snow.

###### Stormy Conditions

Stormy conditions will occur anytime the wind speed is Very Strong. Stormy conditions have their usual effect on characters, except that those below decks or in deckcastles or towers are not affected by the wind.

###### Windy Conditions

Windy conditions will occur anytime the wind speed is Very Strong. Windy conditions have their usual effect on characters, except that those below decks or in deckcastles or towers are not affected by the wind.

### Casualties, Damage, Rest, and Repair at Sea

Full crews operating vessels on sea voyages do not require specific days of rest, as the crew is assumed to sail or row in rotation throughout the voyage. However, if the vessel has less than a full crew, either its speed or its duration of uninterrupted travel will be less.

* A vessel with less than a full crew of rowers reduces its rowing voyage speed in proportion to the missing crew.
* A vessel with less than a full crew but more than half crew of sailors can maintain its sailing voyage speed by day, but must reduce its sailing voyage speed by night in double proportion to the missing crew. Alternatively, it can reduce both its day and night speed in proportion to the missing crew.
* A vessel with less than a half crew of sailors must reduce its sailing voyage speed in proportion to amount of crew missing to reach half-crewed. It must reduce its sailing voyage speed by night to zero. Alternatively, it can reduce both its day and night speed in proportion to the missing crew.
* During combat a vessel will usually have one-half its sailors manning the sails (so it can maintain its full speed), while the other sailors board, repair, or shoot.

Round speed to the nearest 6-mile interval.

EXAMPLE: A longship has a crew of 15 sailors and 60 rowers. It has an oar voyage speed of 30 miles per day and a sail voyage speed of 90 miles per day. In a battle, 5 sailors and 20 rowers are slain. The longship’s oar voyage speed is reduced to [(60-20)/60 x 30] = 20 miles per day. The longship’s sail voyage speed is still 90 miles per day, but if it sails at night, speed is reduced to [(15-5)/15 x 1/2 x 90] = 30 miles per day. Alternatively, the longship could just sail [(10/15) x 90] = 60 miles per day and night.

Damage to a vessel also reduce its voyage speed in proportion to the percentage of its shp lost, rounded to the nearest 6-mile interval. If a vessel is reduced to 0 or less shp, it cannot move under its own power. It will sink after 1d10 turns.

Missing crew and vessel damage also reduce combat speed by the same ratio that they reduce voyage speed, rounded to the nearest 30’ interval. Whether moving at combat or voyage speed, reduction in speed from crew loss and vessel damage are not cumulative — use whichever speed reduction is worse, casualties or damage.

Structural hit points cannot be healed, but they can be repaired. When a vessel is damaged, it takes five crew members one turn to repair each point of structural damage. They cannot take any other action while they are repairing the vessel. The crew can only repair half of any damage sustained while at sea; the remaining damage can only be fixed by using facilities at a dock.
