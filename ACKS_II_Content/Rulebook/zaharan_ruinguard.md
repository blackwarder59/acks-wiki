### Zaharan Ruinguard

Key Attribute: STR and INT

Requirements: INT 9, WIL 9, CHA 9

Hit Dice: 1d6

Maximum Level: 12

In the waning days of the decadent Zaharan empire, as its graceful cities burned to ash and the races of man, elf, and dwarf slaughtered the children of Zahar without mercy for their arrogance and tyranny, an order of militant sorcerer-knights known as ruinguards was ordained by Sebek, last of the sorcerer-kings. The ruinguards were charged with safeguarding the powerful secrets of the chthonic gods and laying down their lives to prevent the voice of Chaos from passing into oblivion.

The hobbled eunuch-seers and iron-bound tomes of the great Zaharan libraries were too burdensome to carry away and hide from the wrathful judgment of Law as it descended upon crumbling Zahar. The ruinguards mastered arcane bindings to focus the dark chthonic secrets of a dying empire within a receptacle they knew they would always have at hand — their very weapons. The Zaharan empire vanished over a millennium ago, but the masters of this tenebrous order have not only carried the knowledge of Chaos with them, but learned to call upon that knowledge to enhance their own martial and magical skill and bring doom to their enemies.

Each ruinguard is a master of his own fate; an individual conduit to the knowledge of Chaos and the chthonic powers spread across the void. Whether they carry such power within them and focus it upon the weapon they wield, or whether the weapon itself holds the chthonic power and they merely call it forth to do battle, even the ruinguard does not truly know. Ruinguards typically adventure to accumulate power, skill, and allies in order to dominate more and more around them — some even harbor dreams of rebuilding an empire. Others resist succumbing completely to the Chaos that constantly seeks to consume them. This rarer breed of ruinguard seeks adventure to quell the wanderlust within themselves and find camaraderie and kinship amongst those adventurers who also choose to wander dark roads and distant lands.

###### Combat Characteristics

Ruinguards are brutal combatants who rarely show mercy. The chthonic powers a ruinguard channels revel in the chaos and brutality of face-to-face combat. They favor the heaviest armor available so they can wade into close quarters and frown upon weapons which draw blood from a distance.

**Combat Proficiencies:** Ruinguards have weapon proficiency with battle axes, great axes, flails, swords, two-handed swords, and whips. They have armor proficiency with all armors. They have fighting style proficiency with the weapon and shield and two-handed weapon styles, but not with the dual weapon style.

**Combat Progression:** Ruinguards advance in attack throws and saving throws as fighters, by two points every three levels of experience. They increase their base damage roll from successful melee attacks using these weapons by +1 at 1st level, and by an additional +1 at 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th level. They can cleave after killing a foe a maximum of once per round per class level.

###### Starting Class Powers:

In addition to their fighting ability, a Zaharan ruinguard's eager embrace of chthonic secrets provides him with several benefits. At the start of play, ruinguards have the following class powers.

**Dark Blessing:** Zaharan ruinguards enjoy the blessing of the chthonic gods. They gain a +2 bonus to all saving throws. (These adjustments are already factored into the saving throws on the Zaharan Ruinguard Attack and Saving Throws table.)

**Manual of Arms:** The ruinguard is highly experienced in military discipline, physical fitness, and weapon drill. He can automatically identify the battle standards, equipment, great captains, military slang, and rank insignia of his homeland. He can identify those of other realms with a proficiency throw of 11+. He can fight as a regular (rather than irregular) troop in formed and loose units. He can begin play as a member of a legion, mercenary's guild, or other military organization (Judge's discretion). (This class power is equivalent to one rank of Manual of Arms proficiency.)

**Preternatural Quickening:** Zaharan ruinguards act with supernatural celerity. A ruinguard gains a +1 bonus to initiative and a +1 bonus to avoid surprise.

**Weapon Focus:** Ruinguards are experts with their weapon of choice. The Zaharan ruinguard gains the Weapon Focus proficiency with his choice of one specific weapon type (axes; maces, flails and hammers; swords and daggers).

###### Additional Class Powers

As a Zaharan ruinguard gains experience, he learns how to tap arcane energy to cast spells and enhance his prowess in battle. They gain the following additional class powers:

**Arcane Magic (2nd level):** As sorcerers as well as warriors, Zaharan ruinguards learn and cast arcane spells. However, they are not as devoted to the arcane arts as mages, so their caster level and progression are at a slower rate. The ruinguard's caster level, and the number and levels of spells the ruinguard can cast in a single day, are listed on the Ruinguard Spell Progression table. Like a mage, a ruinguard's spell selection is limited to the spells in his **repertoire**. A ruinguard's repertoire can include the number of spells up to the number and level of spells listed for his level, increased by his Intellect bonus. Unlike (human) mages, a Zaharan ruinguard can cast spells while wearing any type of armor.

**Arcane Striking (2nd level):** The Zaharan ruinguard learns to channel arcane energy through his melee weapons. Whenever the ruinguard successfully hits a target with a melee attack, he can immediately expend one of his daily spell slots to increase damage. Damage is increased by 1d6 per level of the spell slot expended. Damage dealt by arcane striking counts as extraordinary arcane damage. If the target is slain by his arcane strike, the ruinguard is eligible to cleave as if he had slain the target in melee.

EXAMPLE: Moruvai needs to make an attack throw of 14+ to strike the great dragon Orm. Finally, he does so! He immediately expends a 1st level spell slot to do an extra 1d6 damage on his hit.

**Death Healing (4th level):** The Zaharan ruinguard learns to drain the life force of fallen foes in order to heal himself. Whenever the ruinguard successfully slays a sentient creature with a melee attack, he can expend a spell slot to heal himself. Healing is 1d6 per level of the spell slot expended, to a maximum value equal to the slain victim's maximum (starting) hit points. The ruinguard can cleave after death healing if he has any cleaves remaining. A ruinguard with sufficient spell slots can combine death healing and arcane striking.

EXAMPLE: Moruvai slays a hobgoblin (hp 7). He sacrifices a 2nd level spell and heals himself 2d6 hit points. The 2d6 roll is an 8; Moruvai heals 7 hp because he cannot heal more than the slain victim's hit points.

**Dark Charisma (5th level):** The ruinguard's sinister presence begins to inspire the forces of evil to follow him. Any Chaotic characters or monsters in the ruinguard's service gain a +1 bonus to their morale score whenever he personally leads them. The bonus stacks with any modifiers from the ruinguard's Charisma or proficiencies.

**Minor Magical Research (7th level):** The Zaharan ruinguard can research spells, scribe magical scrolls, and brew potions as if he were a 5th level mage.

**Dark Fortress (9th level):** By acquiring a **dark fortress** worth at least 15,000gp, the Zaharan ruinguard can attract followers to his service. 5d6 x 10 0th level or beastman troops and 1d6 Zaharan ruinguards of 1st – 3rd level arrive to serve him within 1d3 months of him acquiring the fortress. If the ruinguard already has a fortress, the followers arrive to serve him within 1d3 months of him reaching 9th level. The ruinguard must pay his followers the ordinary rates for mercenaries and henchmen or they leave his service. Should he prove a powerful, ruthless leader, the ruinguard's power may spread like a dark blight across the realm as those drawn to dark power flock to his banner. Additional rules for dark fortresses are detailed in the **Campaigns** chapter (p. XX).

**Spell Storing (9th level):** The ruinguard learns to channel his spells into his weapon. Whenever a ruinguard casts a spell that would normally target a creature, he can instead cast it into his melee weapon, where it remains stored until discharged. The effect will discharge onto the next creature the ruinguard strikes with the weapon, resulting in both melee damage and the normal effects of the spell. The ruinguard can only store one spell at a time, and the spell will discharge harmlessly if not used in 1 turn (10 minutes),if the weapon is sundered, or if the ruinguard loses his grip on the weapon. A ruinguard with sufficient spell slots can combine spell storing, death healing, and/or arcane striking. A character being killed by a stored spell does not allow the ruinguard to cleave.

EXAMPLE: Moruvai casts *dismember*into his two-handed sword, spell storing it. He then attacks a minotaur, and hits, dealing his normal melee damage. Upon hitting, Moruvai uses his arcane striking power, expending a 2nd level spell slot to deal an additional 2d6 damage. *Dismember*also discharges, and the minotaur fails its save, taking an additional 3d6 damage and a permanent wound from the spell. The cumulative damage slays the minotaur. Moruvai then expends a 3rd level spell slot and death heals himself 3d6 damage. Because the damage from *dismember* was needed to kill the minotaur, Moruvai cannot cleave.

**Major Magical Research (12th level)**: The Zaharan ruinguard can an create more powerful magic items such as weapons, rings, and staffs, as if he were a 9th level mage.

###### Racial Traits

As true Zaharans, all ruinguards also possess certain inhuman benefits and drawbacks from their near-extinct bloodline.

**After the Flesh:** For most mortals, undeath is a curse. For Zaharans, it is a pathway to power. If transformed into intelligent undead, the Zaharan ruinguard retains his racial powers and his class abilities. Once transformed, the ruinguard can continue to advance in Hit Dice without limit, even past his class's maximum level. A 1 HD undead ruinguard requires 4,000 XP to advance to 2 HD plus an additional 500 XP per * the undead possesses. The amount of XP required to advance as an undead doubles with each HD thereafter (round values greater than 20,000 XP to the nearest 1,000). All of the ruinguard's class abilities will continue to progress without regard to his class's maximum level, to a maximum of 14th level. The ***ACKS II Judges Journal***offers additional rules for characters advancing via this power (p. XX).

**Ancient Pacts:** The lords of Zahar ensorcelled the dark powers of the world with ancient pactsof service and obedience. Some creatures still remember these pacts and will aid Zaharans when commanded. All ruinguards gain a +1 bonus to reaction rolls when encountering intelligent Chaotic monsters. Intelligent Chaotic monsters suffer a -2 penalty to saving throws against any enchantment spells cast by a Zaharan ruinguard.

**Dark Souls:** Because of their black spirits, the grim embrace of death holds special perils for Zaharans. Whenever a deceased Zaharan rolls on the Tampering With Mortality table, he suffers a penalty on the 1d20 roll of -1 per level of experience.

**Inexorable:** Ruinguards are inexorable in the face of horrors that terrify normal men. They are immune to all natural and magical **fear** effects.

**Zaharan Tongues:** Due to their background and training, all Zaharan ruinguards can speak Ancient Zaharan, Common, Goblin, Orc, and Kemeshi.

###### Class Proficiencies

**Proficiency Progression:** At 1st level, ruinguards select one class proficiency from their class proficiency list and one general proficiency from the general proficiency list. They select an additional class proficiency at 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th level. They select an additional general proficiency at 5th and 9th level.
