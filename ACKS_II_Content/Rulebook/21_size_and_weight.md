## Size and Weight

**Size categories** are an abstract measure of a creature’s or object’s overall mass and bulk. In order from smallest to largest: small, man-sized, large, huge, gigantic, colossal. The table below shows the typical range of heights and weights for each size category. All of the playable races in this book are **man-sized**. On your character sheet, you should record your size as man-sized and weight as 15 stone.
