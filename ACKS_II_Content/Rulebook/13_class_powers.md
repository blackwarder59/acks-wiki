## Class Powers

Class powers are the special abilities that make classes effective within their niche. Some class powers are simply bonus proficiencies that are automatically assigned to every member of the class (such as the fighterâ€™s Manual of Arms class power), but most class powers are unique to the class.

Each class has a mix of Starting and Additional Class Powers. Starting Class Powers are available at 1st level and should be recorded on your character sheet at the start of play. Additional Class Powers will become available as your character ascends to higher levels.
