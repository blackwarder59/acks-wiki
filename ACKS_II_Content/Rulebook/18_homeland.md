## Homeland

Every adventurer comes from somewhere*.* A character’s homeland can (but doesn’t have to) be used to inform your choice of name, height, weight, appearance, and other factors. If your Judge is running ***ACKS***using the Auran Empire campaign setting, head to Appendix A (p. XX) and check out the available homelands to pick yours. If your Judge is running ***ACKS***in another campaign setting, check with him to find out his plans.

EXAMPLE: Norden is a vaultguard in the Auran Empire campaign setting. Reading Appendix A, Zach sees that dwarves can hail from either the Jutting Mountains or Meniri Mountains. Zach chooses to make Norden’s homeland the Meniri Mountains. Based on the information found in Appendix A, he describes Norden as having grey-brown eyes, medium brown skin, and wavy chestnut hair and beard.
