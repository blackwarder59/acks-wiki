## Ending Battles

A battle ends when all of the units of one army have voluntarily withdrawn, routed, and/or been destroyed.

### Annihilation

A battle immediately ends if all of the units of either army are destroyed. Such an outcome is rare unless the army’s leader has a very high morale modifier. In most cases, a battle will end from voluntary withdrawal or rout long before this occurs.

### Voluntary Withdrawal

A battle immediately ends if either of the armies **voluntarily withdraws**. Armies which suffer a morale collapse are very vulnerable to pursuit, so a wise leader will conduct a voluntary withdrawal before this occurs.

### Morale Collapse

Armies do not, as a rule, fight to the last man (or elf, or orc). Instead they suffer a gradual loss of morale, becoming increasingly disordered as casualties mount, until eventually the army is swept away in a rout. These effects are simulated with **morale rolls**.

During the Morale Phase, every unit in an army must make a morale roll if:

* One or more units in the army were destroyed or disordered during the preceding combat round; and
* The total number of units destroyed in the battle thus far plus the number of units that are currently disordered is equal to or greater than the army’s **break point.** An army’s break point is always 1/3 of the army’s starting number of units, rounded up.

EXAMPLE: Marcus began the battle with an army of 12 units. The army’s break point is (1/3 x 12) 4. During the preceding battle turn, Marcus’s army lost its fourth unit. Since at least one unit was destroyed during the preceding battle turn, and the total number of units destroyed (4) is equal to or greater than the army’s break point, every unit in Marcus’s army must make a morale roll.

### Morale Rolls

To make a morale roll, the unit’s commander rolls 2d6, adds the unit’s morale score, and consults the Unit Morale table. The die roll should be modified based on the army and unit modifiers listed on the Morale Roll Modifiers table below.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Unit Morale** | |
| **Adjusted Die Roll** | **Result** |
| 2- | Rout |
| 3 – 5 | Flee |
| 6 – 8 | Waver |
| 9 – 11 | Stand Firm |
| 12+ | Rally |

**Rout:** The unit immediately **routs** off the battlefield. It will play no further part in the battle, and counts as destroyed for battle resolution purposes.

**Flee:** The unit retreats in disorder. It is moved into the reserve and marked as disordered. It cannot be redeployed until rallied. If the battle ends before the unit is rallied, it counts as routed.

**Waver:** The unit’s morale is wavering. Its BR is halved when attacking. If in the reserve, it cannot be redeployed until reformed.

**Stand Firm:** The unit remains steady. No effect.

**Rally**: The unit rallies under the pressure of battle. Its BR is increased by half when attacking next battle turn. If disordered or wavering, those conditions expire.

| --- | --- |
| **Morale Roll Modifiers** | **Modifier** |
| *Army Modifiers (apply to all units)* |  |
| Army leader present on battlefield | +1/2 Morale Modifier (round up) |
| Army has lost 1/2 or more of its starting units, but less than 2/3 | -2 |
| Army has lost 2/3 or more of its starting units | -5 |
| Army has destroyed more units than opposing army | +2 |
| Army has lost more units than opposing army | -2 |
| Army cannot retreat (surrounded, trapped, etc.) | +2 |
| Army defending homeland / sacred ground | Judge’s Discretion |
| *Unit Modifiers* |  |
| Commander attached to unit | + Morale Modifier |
| Unit is wavering or disordered | -2 |
| Unit is adjacent to a broken zone | -2 |

The army’s general determines the order in which his units will make morale rolls. The effects of each morale roll are resolved before rolling for the next unit. It is possible for the results of earlier morale rolls to impact those of later rolls, causing a cascade of flight off the battlefield.

EXAMPLE: Since a unit was destroyed during the preceding battle turn, and the total number of units destroyed is equal to or greater than his army’s break point, every unit in Marcus’s army must make a morale roll.

Marcus’s morale modifier is a confident +5. His army gains a bonus of 1/2 that, or +3. His army has lost 1/3 of its starting units, which imposes no modifier. However, his army has lost more units than the opposing army, which imposes a -2 penalty. The total army modifier is therefore +1.

The first unit is a unit of heavy infantry (morale score 0). Marcus rolls 2d6 and gets a 6, modified to a 7. The unit is wavering. Its BR will be halved from 2 to 1 when attacking next turn.
