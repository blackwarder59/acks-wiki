# Chapter 6: Adventures

### Delves, Expeditions, and Voyages

Whether the adventurers are undertaking a specific quest for a patron, or simply seeking excitement, fame, and wealth, they will not find what they seek in the safety of towns and homesteads. Some adventures will take place in underground complexes such as crypts, tombs, labyrinths, or caverns. These locations, generally called **dungeons**, can vary greatly in their layout, design, and location, but all share one common characteristic â€” they are filled with a variety of challenges and dangers such as deadly monsters, traps, puzzles, and the potential for valuable treasures. An adventure in a dungeon is called a **delve**.

Other adventures will take place in thinly-settled frontiers or even unsettled lands beyond the borders of civilization. These **wildernesses** will confront the adventurers with natural hazards, wild beasts, savage tribes, and monstrous predators. An adventure in the wilderness is called an **expedition**.

Some adventures will even take the characters to the treacherous waters of the high seas, where they may face lacerating weather, sea monsters, and lost isles. Sea adventurers are called **voyages**. Voyages can involve fleets of vessels, aquatic and flying monsters, artillery, weather, and other complexities, which are discussed separately in Chapter 7.
