Shamans are divine spellcasters who commune with spirits of nature, ancestors, and the elemental forces. They serve as spiritual guides, healers, and protectors for tribal communities. Unlike civilized priests who worship in temples, shamans practice their magic in the wild places of the world, drawing power from the primal forces of nature. Most shamans come from barbarian tribes or primitive cultures.

## Combat Characteristics

Shamans are moderately capable fighters, trained in the weapons and tactics of their tribal heritage. They rely more on their spiritual powers and animal allies than pure martial prowess.

**Combat Proficiencies:** Shamans have weapon proficiency with clubs, crossbows, daggers, darts, javelins, oil, slings, spears, staves, and any weapons common to their tribe. They have armor proficiency with light armor and leather armor. They have no fighting style proficiencies.

**Combat Progression:** Shamans advance in attack throws and saving throws as thieves, by one point every two levels of experience. Shamans increase their base damage roll from successful missile and melee attacks by +1 at 1st level and by an additional +1 at 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th level.

## Magic

Shamans are divine spellcasters who receive their magic from spirits of nature, ancestors, and the elemental forces. Their magic focuses on nature, animals, weather, and spiritual communion.

**Spell Acquisition:** Shamans acquire spells through spiritual communion and ritual. They do not use spell books. All shaman spells of the appropriate level are considered to be "known" by the shaman and he need not select them individually. Shamans can cast 1st level spells from 1st level.

**Spell Slots:** A shaman's spell-casting ability is summarized on the **Shaman Spell Progression** table. That table shows the number of spell slots available at each class level, according to the level of the spell. A 1st level shaman can cast one 1st level spell per day, while a 14th level shaman can cast six 1st level spells, six 2nd level spells, five 3rd level spells, five 4th level spells, four 5th level spells, and three 6th level spells per day.

**Spell Casting:** Shamans must have their hands free to cast spells. Shamans cannot cast divine spells while wearing armor heavier than light armor. Shamans may cast spells from a spell scroll of divine spells, regardless of class, with a proficiency throw of 10+ (adding the spell level to this throw).

**Spell List:** The list of spells available to shamans can be found at the end of this chapter.

**Restoring Magic:** Shamans regain their ability to cast spells through spiritual communion with nature. They must spend at least 4 hours in meditation or ritual to recover their spell slots.

## Starting Class Powers

At the start of play, shamans have the class powers below:

**Animal Companion:** A shaman begins play with a loyal animal companion. This animal is typically a wolf, bear, eagle, or other creature native to the shaman's homeland. The animal companion has HD equal to half the shaman's level (minimum 1) and gains +2 to all saving throws. If the animal companion dies, the shaman can attract a new one through a week-long ritual.

**Divine Favor:** Shamans serve the spirits of nature and can gain favor for their service to the natural world. A shaman begins play with 1d6 points of divine favor with the nature spirits. Additional rules for divine favor can be found in the **Campaigns** chapter.

**Nature Sense:** Shamans have an innate connection to the natural world. They automatically know the direction of true north, can predict weather 24 hours in advance with 90% accuracy, and can identify animals, plants, and natural phenomena without a proficiency throw.

**Spirit Sight:** A shaman can see invisible creatures and objects, and can perceive the presence of spirits, ghosts, and other supernatural entities within 30 feet. This ability functions constantly but can be suppressed at will.

**Wilderness Survival:** The shaman has an extraordinary degree of woodcraft. A shaman can find food, water, and shelter for himself in any natural environment. The number of others the shaman can support is equal to his class level. This ability functions as the barbarian class power.

## Additional Class Powers

When they advance in level, shamans gain the following additional class powers:

**Speak with Animals (3rd level):** The shaman can communicate with any normal animal at will, as if using the spell speak with animals.

**Weather Sense (5th level):** The shaman can predict weather up to one week in advance with 100% accuracy and can sense approaching natural disasters (earthquakes, floods, etc.) 24 hours before they occur.

**Spirit Journey (7th level):** Once per day, the shaman can send his spirit from his body to scout or deliver messages. This functions as the spell astral projection but lasts only one hour and the shaman's spirit can travel up to 10 miles from his body.

**Sacred Grove (9th level):** By establishing a **sacred grove** worth at least 5,000gp, the shaman can attract followers to serve him. 2d4 1st level shamans and 1d6 1st level druids will arrive to serve him within 1d6 weeks of him establishing the grove. If the shaman already has a grove, the followers arrive within 1d6 weeks of him reaching 9th level. If hired, the followers must be paid standard rates for henchmen. These followers will serve the character with loyalty as long as he maintains his connection to nature. A wise shaman can use his sacred grove to protect natural areas, communicate with spirits, and build a community of nature-worshippers. Additional rules for sacred groves are detailed in the **Campaigns** chapter.

**Great Spirit (13th level):** Once per week, the shaman can call upon the Great Spirit to gain extraordinary power. For one hour, the shaman gains:
- +4 bonus to all saving throws
- Immunity to natural weather effects
- The ability to cast any shaman spell without expending spell slots
- The ability to transform into any natural animal at will
- Telepathic communication with all animals within 1 mile

They select an additional class proficiency at 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th level. They select an additional general proficiency at 5th, 9th, and 13th level.
