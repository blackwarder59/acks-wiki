## Army Organization

A body of men without order, organization, and officers cannot wage war. Once a leader has raised an army, he must organize it into **units** and **divisions**.

### Units

Troops in an army are organized into company-sized units. Each unit may have up to 120 man-sized creatures, 60 large (cavalry or ogre-sized) creatures, 20 huge creatures, 5 gigantic creatures, or 1 colossal creature. Where possible, units should consist exclusively of creatures of the same race, class, level, Hit Dice, and equipment.

If necessary, units may be made of any mix of creatures. Each unit has a minimum equivalent of 20 men or other normal-sized creatures, and a maximum equivalent of 120 men. Large creatures such as bears, ogres, or human cavalry on horses count as 2 men. Huge creatures such as chimeras, hill giants, or wyverns count as 6 men. Gigantic creatures such as giant crocodiles, mammoths, or stegosaurs count as 24 men. Colossal creatures such as ancient dragons, giant rocs, or black worms count as 120 men. Living and undead creatures cannot be part of the same unit. Infantry and cavalry cannot be part of the same unit.

EXAMPLE: Marcus has 60 heavy cavalry, 360 heavy infantry, 360 light infantry, and 360 bowmen. He divides these troops into 1 unit of 60 heavy cavalry, 3 units of 120 heavy infantry, 3 units of 120 light infantry, and 3 units of 120 bowmen, for a total of 10 units.

### Divisions

After the army’s troops have been divided into units, the next step is to assign those units to divisions. A division represents a group of units positioned in proximity to each other in the army’s line of battle and supervised by a **commander** reporting to the army’s leader.

An army must have a minimum of three units and can have a maximum number of divisions equal to the maximum number of henchmen the army leader may retain, i.e. four plus his Charisma bonus or penalty. If the army leader has Leadership proficiency, the number of divisions permitted in his army is increased by one. (See also **leadership ability**,p. XX).

EXAMPLE: Marcus has CHA 16 (+2) and Leadership proficiency. His army may have up to (4+2+1) 7 divisions. Since he has only 10 units, he decides to organize his army into 4 divisions. The first division is assigned his 1 unit of heavy cavalry. Each of the other divisions is assigned 1 unit of heavy infantry, 1 unit of light infantry, and 1 unit of bowmen.
