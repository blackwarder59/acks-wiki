## Hit Points

Hit points (hp) are a measure of a character’s ability to survive in combat. When a character is brought down to 0 or fewer hit points, he is incapacitated and possibly dead. Hit points are not a direct representation of the character’s capacity to receive physical injury. Rather, they represent a holistic combination of fighting skill, stamina, luck, and the favor of the gods, all of which contribute to helping the character roll with blows and survive attacks that would have killed a lesser combatant.

At 1st level, you roll your character’s hit points with one hit die (HD). Each character class rolls a different type of hit die to determine hit points, based on their toughness in battle, as explained in the **Character Classes** section. If you roll 4 or less, treat the result as a 4. Add your Constitution bonus or penalty to the roll and note the result as your hit points on your character sheet.

Thereafter, each time the character gains an additional hit die from leveling, you reroll his hit points using your character’s new number of hit dice, adding his Constitution bonus or penalty to each die rolled. You note the result as your new hit points on your character sheet. If, due to ill luck, your new hit points would be less than or equal to your hit points at your prior level of experience, you just gain 1 hit point. Once you reach 10th level, you no longer gain hit dice or add your Constitution bonus or penalty, you simply gain additional hit points (making 9th level the last level at which you gain a new hit die). Even at 10th level and higher, however, you reroll all hit dice gained up to that point when determining your new hit point total.

### Optional Rules for Determining Hit Points

At the Judge’s discretion, any of the following optional rules can be used to make characters hardier. The Judge can even apply different rules for different classes if desired. For instance, if he wants to encourage players to roll up human characters, he could allow all human classes to start with maximum hit points, but not demi-human classes.

###### Blessed by the Gods (Optional)

Do not roll for your character’s hit points at 1st level. Instead, give your character the maximum hit points he could have rolled, e.g. 8 for fighters, 6 for explorers and crusaders, and 4 for thieves, mages, and venturers, modified by his Constitution.

###### Cursed by the Gods (Optional)

Roll your character’s hit points with one Hit Die. Do not apply any minimums. If you roll a 1, well, good luck.

###### From Ordinary to Extraordinary (Optional)

Before he became an adventurer, your character was just an ordinary 0th-level member of his race. Roll 1d6 hit points to determine his hit points at 0th level. When your character earned his 1st level of experience (prior to play), he might have gained more hit points. Roll the appropriate Hit Die for your class. If the result of the roll is greater than your 0th level hit points, record the new roll. If the roll is less than or equal to your 0th level hit points, you begin play with your 0th level hit points +1.

EXAMPLE: Zach has rolled up Norden, a 1st level dwarven vaultguard. Before Norden became a 1st level dwarven vaultguard, he was just an ordinary 0th-level dwarf. To find out how many hit points he had at that level, Zach rolls 1d6. The result is a 4. Zach now rolls 1d8 for Norden’s hit points at first level. If the result is 1, 2, 3, or 4, Norden starts with his 0th level hit points +1, or 5 hit points. If the result is 5 or more, Norden starts with hit points equal to the result.
