Monsters can be mindless, bestial, semi-sapient, or sapient. Mindless creatures function purely on instinct. Bestial monsters are aware of their environment, can remember past events, and can engage in limited problem-solving, but are not self-aware. Semi-sapient monsters are self-aware but lack one or more of the capabilities of sapient creatures, such as abstract reasoning, grammatical language, or tool use. Sapient creatures are self-aware and capable of abstract reasoning, grammatical language, and tool use. Most constructs and oozes are mindless, while most animals and vermin are bestial. Some animals, such as apes, elephants, parrots, and ravens, are semi-sapient. Monstrosities can be bestial, semi-sapient, or sapient. Giants and humanoids are always sapient. A creature’s sapiency determines the opportunity and frequency for it to make saving throws against certain spells.

You should select whatever is appropriate given your creative vision for the monster. Monsters of bestial intelligence will have a trainability modifier and training period determined by their body form. The **Monster Intelligence by Body Form** table has recommended trainability modifiers and training periods for the various body forms. You can modify these as desired to represent the temperament and intelligence of different species.

EXAMPLE: The chittering crawler is a monstrosity. Consulting the Monster Intelligence by Type table, the Judge sees a monstrosity can have either animal or sapient intelligence. He envisions his monster as brutish and instinctual, so he gives it animal intelligence. Reviewing the Animal Intelligence by Body Form table, he sees that a scolopendrine form has trainability modifier -3 and base training period 4.5 months. The Judge decides that his monster is more cunning but more vicious than a typical scolopendrine; he improves the trainability modifier to -1, but worsens the creature’s base training period to 6 months.
