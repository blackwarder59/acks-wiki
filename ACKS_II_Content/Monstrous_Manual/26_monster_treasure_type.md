## Monster Treasure Type

Determine the monster’s **average treasure value** by multiplying 4 times the XP value of one monster times the average number of monsters encountered in its dungeon lair. (If the monster has no dungeon lair, use its wilderness lair.)

Average Treasure Value = 4 x Monster XP Value x Average Number Encountered

Next decide whether the monster accumulates treasure by hoarding, by raiding, by accident, or not at all. Consult the **Monster Treasure Type** table, below, cross referencing its average treasure value with its method of treasure accumulation to find its treasure type(s). Adjust the treasure value up or down by one or more rows if the monster should have more or less treasure than usual for its HD.

### Treasure Accumulation by Monster Type

In designing the monsters presented in this book, each monster’s type was used to guide the treasure type allocated to it.

* Animals generally do not accumulate treasure at all, and are assigned a treasure type of “none.” However, animals that are semi-sapient, swallow creatures whole, or so formidable that they are on par with monstrosities have been assigned incidental treasure types.
* Beastmen accumulate treasure by raiding.
* Constructs accumulate treasure by accident (from slain creatures that have disturbed them) or unwittingly (it having been placed there by their creator). Constructs have been assigned incidental treasure types.
* Dragons accumulate treasure by hoarding.
* Monstrosities of bestial intelligence and vermin generally accumulate treasure by accident, and have been assigned incidental treasure types. Semi-sapient bestial monstrosities might have any treasure type depending on their behaviors.
* Monstrosities and undead of sapient intelligence, as well as all giants and humanoids, accumulate treasure by either hoarding or raiding.
* Oozes generally do not accumulate treasure and are assigned a treasure type of “none.” Occasionally a particular ooze (such as a gelatinous mass) might end up carrying treasure with it, and be given an incidental treasure type.

### Treasure from Spoils and Offspring

Some monsters have very valuable spoils, such as valuable antlers, hides, horns, or eggs. The fact that adventurers can transport these spoils back to civilization to earn XP suggests the spoils should be counted against each monster’s treasure. However, transporting spoils over long distances is difficult, and the spoils themselves are often expensive to store and hard to sell. These facts suggest that spoils should not be counted against each monster’s treasure. In designing the monsters presented in this book, we have generally treated spoils as being treasure worth half their value.
