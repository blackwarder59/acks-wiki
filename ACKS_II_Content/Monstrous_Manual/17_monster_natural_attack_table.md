## Monster Natural Attack Table

In most cases, the monster’s attack sequence should inflict an average of 2 hp of damage per HD the monster possesses divided among all their attacks. But how much should each of those attacks do? The **Monster Natural Attack** table offers recommended monster damage for some common natural attacks at various HD ranges. These values are extrapolated from those that appear in *ACKS* and can be used to help determine a new monster’s damage from its attacks. These values are guidelines only, however, and you should feel free to diverge from them as necessary to balance the monster. Damage type will depend on the natural weapon, the monster type, and the monster HD and special abilities.

EXAMPLE #1: The Judge is creating an 8 HD animal with an ursine body form called the koalatau*r*. An ursine’s natural attacks are 2 claws and 1 bite. Its average damage per attack sequence should be around (8 x 2) 16 points. The Judge chooses 2 small claws (at 8 HD, these deal 1d6 points of damage each) and 1 small bite (at 8 HD, this deals 2d8 points of damage). The koalataur’s average damage per attack sequence is (3.5 + 3.5 + 9) 16 points.

EXAMPLE: #2: The Judge is creating a 10 HD monstrosity with a scolopendrine body form called the chittering crawler. A scolopendrine’s natural attacks are 1 bite and 0-8 tentacles. Its average damage per attack sequence should be around (10 x 2) 20 points. The Judge first chooses 1 medium bite dealing 2d10 points of damage. That equates to an average of 11 points of damage per round, so the Judge must distribute another 9 points of average damage across the monster’s other attacks. He opts for 6 tentacles dealing 1d2 points of damage each. The chittering crawler’s average damage per attack sequence is [11 + 6 x (1.5)] 20 points.

### Monsters with Weapons

Some monsters may use weapons in lieu of or in addition to natural attacks. Monsters using a normal weapon such as a sword, battle axe, or mace inflict an average of 2.5 hp of damage plus 1 hp of damage per HD the monster possesses. The amount should be increased or decreased if the weapon is tiny or large. Extra damage dice can be granted in lieu of a damage bonus (e.g., grant +1d6 instead of +4 damage). Monsters using weapons can be given a fighter damage bonus based on their HD when using weapons.

EXAMPLE: Orcs are 1 HD beastmen, so they do an average of (2.5 + 1) = 3.5 or 1d6 damage with weapons. Hobgoblins are 1+1 HD, but gain an additional fighter damage bonus of +1, so they deal 4.5 or 1d6+1 damage with weapons.
