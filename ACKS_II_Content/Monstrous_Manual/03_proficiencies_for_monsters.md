## Proficiencies for Monsters

Like human and demi-human characters, some monsters also possess proficiencies. However, most monsters do not spend their lives training for dungeon encounters with adventurers, and their proficiency choices tend to favor everyday skills such as Animal Husbandry, Endurance, Labor, Navigation, Survival, or Trapping. For the most part, these will have little impact on play, and for simplicity can be ignored. If a monster is exceptionally intelligent, dangerous, or well-trained, though, you can use the rules below to assign proficiencies to it.

A sapient monster begins with the Monster proficiency as well as one class proficiency and one general proficiency.

**Monster:** The monster is well-equipped for life as a creature of its kind. The specific tasks which are covered by this proficiency are determined by the type of creature, but will generally include knowing how to find food, secure shelter, easily open stuck dungeon doors, wait patiently for prey, collect treasure for barter, etc. This is the equivalent of the Adventuring proficiency for monsters.

In addition, a monster with an Intelligence bonus will gain additional general proficiencies equal to this bonus. If a monster has more HD than normal for its species (such as an orc chieftain with 4 HD), it earns additional class and general proficiencies; treat each HD gained as a class level of fighter. A monster also gains an additional general proficiency when it reaches the middle aged, old, and ancient age categories for its species.

EXAMPLE: Bailshar is a middle aged orc chieftain (4 HD) of exceptional intelligence (INT 16, +2). Having seen a prior chief slain by adventurers while he was but a whelp, he has ruthlessly trained himself to be ready for the next band of “heroes” who attacks his village. Bailshar begins play with Monster (orc) proficiency, plus one class and one general proficiency. Having gained 3 HD more than the average orc, he counts as having gained three fighter levels for proficiency purposes, so this adds one additional class proficiency (for a total of two). His high INT earns him two more general proficiencies, and middle age provides one more (for a total of four). The Judge selects Combat Reflexes and Command as Bailshar’s class proficiencies. He chooses Animal Training, Leadership, Manual of Arms, and Military Strategy as Bailshar’s general proficiencies. When the Judge designs the dungeon where Bailshar rules, he stocks it with trained animals and notes that the orcs are trained in small-unit tactics and have exceptional morale (from Bailshar’s Command proficiency).

### Ageless Monsters

Creatures who lack some or all age categories will gain fewer or no proficiencies with age. For instance, elves remain at the Adult age category until death, so they do not gain general proficiencies for reaching an Old or Ancient age category.

### Transformed Monsters

Sometimes a sapient monster may be transformed from one type of creature to another type with a different set of age categories, or no age categories at all. For instance, a dwarf might be transformed into a vampire. When this occurs, the creature continues to gain proficiencies based on its original age categories. Once it reaches its original ancient age category, it ceases gaining proficiencies from age, even if it lives for millennia thereafter. (Sorry, liches.)

EXAMPLE: As a reward for his loyal service to the local dark lord, Bailshar the orc chieftain is transformed into a vampire. He is 37 years old (Middle Aged for an orc) when this occurs. As a vampire, he ceases aging. Nevertheless, when he reaches 45 years of age (Old for an orc), Bailshar gains an additional general proficiency. He gains an additional general proficiency when he turns 60 (Ancient for an orc). He then endures centuries of apathy without gaining any proficiencies, eventually taking a walk at dawn at age 1,040 out of boredom.
