## Monster Organization

Choose the monster’s **typical dungeon encounter** and **typical wilderness encounter.** Each typical encounter entry should be listed as: [Collective Noun] (Number Encountered) / [Collective Noun] (Number Encountered). The first collective noun (e.g., “gang”) and subsequent number encountered (“2d4”) describes encounters outside of the creature’s lair. The second collective noun (“lair”) and subsequent number encountered (“1 warband”) describes encounters inside the creature’s lair.

The number encountered in the lair is usually a distinct number of monsters (such as “2d6”), but sometimes is based on the ranges encountered outside the lair (e.g., “1 warband”). The latter is common for monsters that have a clan or tribal structure. If the monster does not make a lair, then list only one collective noun and range. If the monster is not found in one of the two settings (dungeon or wilderness), list “none.”

At this time, you also select the monster’s **Lair** score. This can range from None, for nomadic monsters that maintain no den or nest of any sort, to 100%, for purely sedentary monsters that never leave their lair. The average Lair score is 25%, although this varies widely by body form and even within body forms depending on the monster’s diet and metabolism.

The **Monster Organization** table, below, offers recommendations for typical encounter and % In Lair by body form. These are presented as an average number of Hit Dice for each type of encounter (wandering dungeon, lair dungeon, wandering wilderness, lair wilderness). Monsters with HD which exceed the recommended HD are usually solitary (1).

EXAMPLE #1: The koalataur is an 8 HD ursine. An ursine’s recommended monster organization is sloth (10 HD) for wandering dungeon or wandering wilderness and den (10 HD) for lair dungeon or lair wilderness. 10 HD divided by 8 HD yields 1.25, so there should be 1.25 monsters in a typical encounter. A roll of 1d2 yields an average of 1.5, which is both close to the recommended number and seems like it could represent individuals and/or mated pairs. The Judge records the koalataur’s typical dungeon encounter as sloth (1d2)/den (1d2) and typical wilderness encounter as sloth (1d2)/den (1d2). He selects the default % In Lair of 25%.

EXAMPLE: #2: The chittering crawler is a 10 HD scolopendrine. A scolopendrine’s recommended monster organization is claw (7 HD) for wandering dungeon or wandering wilderness. Since 10 HD exceeds 7 HD, the Judge records his monster’s typical dungeon encounter as solitary (1) and typical wilderness encounter as solitary (1). Since his critter is so large, he decides it is less nomadic than other scolopendrines, and sets % In Lair to 30% instead of the default 10%.
