### Statue, Animated Bronze

Statues of various materials can be made into constructs by powerful spellcasters. Those forged of bronze appear as ordinary cast-bronze figures of mighty heroes and warriors with weapons and shields standing 6’ to 7’ tall and weighing 450 lbs.

###### Combat

Unless they engage in some form of movement, animated statues appear to be normal statues even upon close inspection. Characters encountering stationary animated statues suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls.

Animated bronze statues are **immune** to enchantment effects, necrotic damage, poisonous damage, and mundane bludgeoning, slashing, and piercing damage. They are **resistant** to extraordinary bludgeoning, slashing, and piercing damage.

However, every bronze statue has a **weak point** (such as its ankle, armpit, neck, etc.). Identifying a statue’s weak point requires an action in lieu of attacking and a successful Searching proficiency throw. Characters with Craft (armorer) or Engineering proficiency gain a +4 bonus to identify a statue’s weak point.

Once it is identified, attacks may be directed against a statue’s weak point, albeit at a -4 penalty due to its small size. Any successful attacks targeted at a statue’s weak point bypass its immunities and resistances to deal full damage, and an unmodified attack throw of 20 with a weapon targeted at a statue’s weak point instantly destroys it.

Animated bronze statues count as enchanted creatures for purposes of spells such as *dispel evil*and *holy circle*.

###### Ecology

As constructs, bronze animated statues have no natural habitat. They can be found guarding ancient treasures, dwarven vaults, or places of power or serving powerful spellcasters.

###### Spoils

A destroyed bronze statue can be harvested with Magical Engineering for the following component useful in magic research:

* bronze slag (6 st., 350gp, *physical protection (bludgeoning, piercing slashing*), armor +1, weapon +1)

###### Lore

*Of the great wonders of the world, the Colossus of Corcano is perhaps the most mysterious. The sages of the Tower of Knowledge have come to no agreement as to the identity of its maker nor the date of its creation. Many believe it must predate the Day Without Night. The sages do agree, however, that the Colossus is neither an automaton or a golem but instead an animated bronze statue of prodigious size…*
