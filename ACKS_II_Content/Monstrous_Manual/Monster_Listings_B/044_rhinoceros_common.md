### Rhinoceros, Common

The Tower of Knowledge in Aura once believed that the rhinoceros was a magical crossbreed of a hippopotamus and a unicorn. Explorers and scholars who have journeyed to the Ivory Kingdoms, however, have since proved that the rhinoceros is a natural animal native to Ulruk. This has not dissuaded hunters, who find the rhino’s horns can command a high price in the markets of Shebatea and Opelenea. Measuring 13'9" long and 5'6" tall at shoulder, the mighty herbivore can weigh up to 5,000 lbs.

###### Combat

Characters encountering rhinos suffer a -2 penalty to reaction rolls due to the rhinoceros’ foul temper.

Rhinos prefer to start combat by **charging** with their horn, dealing double damage dice (4d4 {P!}) on a successful charge. After charging, rhinos will attempt to **trample** their opponents. A rhino gains a +4 bonus to attack throws when trampling a small or man-sized creature. If struck, the creature takes damage must make a Paralysis saving throw or be forced aside 10’, landing **prone**. A small creature saves at -6 and a man-sized creature at -4. A rhino can cleave after a successful trample attack that forces aside a creature.

###### Ecology

When rhinos are encountered, there is a 50% chance the adults will be accompanied by 1d4 juvenile rhinos and 1d2 baby rhinos. Juvenile rhinos are large size, have AC 2, Spd 90’, HD 3, and attack by trampling (1d8 {B}). Juvenile rhinos can only take a +4 bonus versus and force aside small creatures, which save at -4. Baby rhinos are man-sized, have AC 1, Spd 90’, HD 2, and attack by stomping (1d3 {B}).

###### Spoils

A slain rhino with exceptional attributes can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following component useful in magic research:

* horn (5 2/6 st, 320gp, *cure disease, discern poison, force of impetus, neutralize poison, striking*, weapon +1)

If not used for magic research, a rhino’s horn fetches 2d2x100gp and weighs 1 st per 450gp value. A rhino’s armored hide fetches 100gp and weighs 13 st.

Rhinos are rarely tamed and trained, though on at least two occasions the Somirean army has used trained war rhinos as shock troops on the field.
