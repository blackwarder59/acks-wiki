### Mummy

Chthonic theology teaches that mortals who die are doomed to oblivion unless they preserve their soul and body together with necromantic magic until the time of the Awakening, when the slumbering gods will rouse and restore the faithful to endless life. A mummy is an undead monster created to await the Awakening, the spirit of the dead human or demi-human necromantically bound to and animating its own preserved corpse.

###### Combat

Mummies have a **horrific** **visage**. When a creature first beholds one or more mummies, and at the start of each round thereafter that it continues to do so, the creature must make a Paralysis saving throw. The save suffers a -1 penalty per additional mummy after the first. If the save fails, the creature is **cowering** until the start of the next round. If the save succeeds, the creature gains immunity to the effects of every mummy’s horrific visage for 1 turn.

Mummies attack with great blows of preternatural strength that deal 1d12 {B!} {N!} damage. Any creature damaged by a mummy’s attack starts **rotting**. Rotting creatures gradually begin to bruise, bleed from their orifices, and slough off hair and skin. They take 1 {N!} damage at dusk each day and cannot benefit from magical healing until the condition ends. Mummy rot can be cured with *cure disease* or temporarily halted with *delay disease*.

Exceptionally powerful magic is used to preserve mummies from the effects of age, mold, and rot. As a result, mummies are **immune** to enchantment effects, to necrotic and poisonous damage, and to mundane acidic, bludgeoning, cold, electric, piercing, seismic, and slashing damage. They are **resistant** to mundane fire damage and to extraordinary acidic, bludgeoning, cold, electric, piercing, seismic, and slashing damage. Extraordinary fire damage and mundane or extraordinary luminous damage have full effect. As undead, mummies are inherently evil for purposes of *discern evil*and *holy circle*spells. They are, of course, rebuked as mummies.

###### Ecology

Mummies once slumbered in every tomb of old Zahar. During the Empyrean War, most were destroyed but some still linger on in the undiscovered tombs and lost ruins of that fell kingdom. In Celdorea, Kemesh, and some parts of Opelenea and Somirea, the Chthonic cults still flourish, and the ranks of the undead continue to grow, even as the Awakening looms.

There is a 10% chance a mummy is infested with 1d10+5 sepulchral worms. In tombs of Dirgion worshippers, this chance may rise to 90%.
