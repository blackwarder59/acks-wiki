### Ogre

Ogres stand 9' to 10' tall and weigh around 800 lbs, resembling big, brutish, hairy humans. They are thought to have been bred from carnivorous apes and hill giants for use as heavy infantry during the Empyrean War that toppled the Kingdom of Zahar. They are the largest humanoids in existence, with larger creatures deemed to be giants. Ogre skin ranges from dull yellow to dull brown and is very hairy. Ogres usually live under rock shelters or in caves, but often will venture into dungeons.

###### Combat

Ogres have **tough hides**, granting them a +3 bonus to AC. They can fight with their fists, dealing 1d10 bludgeoning damage, or with weapons, dealing damage by weapon with a +3 bonus due to their great strength. Most ogre warriors are equipped with fur and hide armor and large two-handed weapons such as morning stars or great axes.

When smashing with piercing or slashing weapons, ogres deliver **vicious blows** that deal an additional 2 points per smash (for a total of +5). When armed with a bludgeoning weapons, ogres can **topple** man-sized or smaller creatures with every attack. A small or man-sized creature struck by an ogre’s swing must make a Paralysis saving throw. If the save fails, the creature takes damage and is knocked prone. If the save succeeds, the creatures take damage but stays on its feet. The ogre can cleave if the creature fails its save against his smash.

###### Ecology

Each ogre gang will be led by a champion with 5 AC, 5+1 HD, 33 hp, and a +4 damage bonus. Each ogre warband will be led by a sub-chieftain with 6 AC, 6+1 HD, 37 hp, and a +5 damage bonus. An ogre lair or village will be led by a chieftain with 7 AC, 8+2 HD, 45 hp, and a +5 damage bonus. As long as the chieftain is alive, the ogres will gain a +2 bonus to morale rolls.

When ogres are encountered in a village, certain additional creatures may be present. Ogre villages will have 2d6 drudges and 2d4 whelps for every 10 ogres. Ogre drudges fight as bugbears, while ogre whelps fight as goblins. There is a 50% chance for 1d10 enslaved captives per warband. In addition, an ogre village has a 50% chance of a shaman being present, and a 25% chance of a witch doctor. A shaman is equivalent to a sub-chieftain statistically, but has the abilities of a shaman of level 1d4. A witch doctor is equivalent to a champion, but has the abilities of a mage of level 1d2.

###### Spoils

When ogres are found away from their lair they will carry sacks containing 1d6x100gp each.
