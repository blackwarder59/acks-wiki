### Venous Sentinel

The necromantically-animated heart and veins of a humanoid, a venous sentinel is a terrible, alien thing, a pulsing heart set at the center of a mass of writhing, sharp-tipped arteries and veins. Sometimes created during the mummification process when the heart and arteries are removed intact, venous sentinels can be found set as guardians in Zaharan tombs, as well as secured in canopic jars, ready to attack when inadvertently released.

###### Combat

Venous Sentinels use their manifold blood vessels for **terrestrial mechanoreception**,enabling them to sense vibration in the ground over long distances equivalent to line of sight in full daylight.

These undead skitter forth obscenely on enlarged and animated veins, while using other veins to pierce foes and drain them of their vital fluids. If a venous sentinel damages a target with a vein, the vein latches onto the target and begins **draining blood**. Thereafter the vein can automatically deal another 1d4 {N!} damage to the target each round without having to make an attack throw. Doing so counts as the venous sentinel’s attack with that vein. Multiple veins can drain blood from the same target.

Creatures that have veins attached to them can still move but count as carrying 2 extra stone of encumbrance. The venous sentinel moves with the creature it is attached to. If it has veins attached to multiple creatures, it can remain attached to them all provided they stay within 10’ of each other; if the distance exceeds 10’ it must choose which creature(s) to stay attached to, and release the other(s).

Otherwise, a creature can only escape or be freed from a vein by killing the venous sentinel or severing the vein. An attached vein can be cut off by dealing 3 or more slashing damage to it in one blow. Any damage dealt beyond 3 points is not dealt to the venous sentinel (the vein was already severed). A venous sentinel loses one attack each time a vein is severed. Each vein must be severed separately.

Like all undead, venous sentinels are immune to enchantment effects and poisonous damage. They are rebuked as ghouls. A destroyed venous sentinel can be harvested with Healing 2 for their heart (4/6 st, 38gp, *cause light wounds, life transfer, swift strike*).

###### Ecology

As undead constructs, venous sentinels have no natural habitat. They are commonly found in catacombs, crypts, and tombs of Chthonic dead.

###### Spoils

A destroyed venous sentinel can be harvested with Healing 2 for the following component useful in magic research:

* heart (3/6 st., 29gp, *life transfer*)
