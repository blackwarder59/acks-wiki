### Snake, King Cobra

King cobras are 10’ to 15' long carnivorous serpents that are native to southern Somirea. As apex predators, king cobras prey primarily on other snakes and lizards. They have been known to slay and swallow giant lizards, though usually their prey is smaller.

Like the viper, the cobra is revered as a symbol of the Chthonic gods in the Sunset Kingdoms and despised for the same reason in the east.

###### Combat

King cobras have **acute olfaction** that grants them a +1 bonus to avoid surprise in their natural habitat. They can also sense earth-borne vibrations, granting them a limited **terrestrial mechanoreception** with a maximum range of 300’.

They are extremely quick, and can bite twice with each combat action for 1d4 {P} damage. Any creature damaged by a bite must make a Death saving throw. If the save fails, the creature dies of poison 1d4+2 turns later.

Any creature unlucky enough to be damaged by both bites must make two saving throws. If either saving throw fails, the creature dies of poison 1d4+2 turns later. If both saving throws fail, the creature dies of poison 1 turn later.

###### Ecology

King cobras are the only snake that constructs actual nests to guard their young. When a nest of cobras is encountered, there is a 10% chance per cobra that it will be incubating a clutch of 2d20 eggs. The eggs have 1 hp and weight 1/1000 st (1 coin). Cobra snakelets are rarely found in nests, because the snakelets immediately disperse into the wild after they emerge from their eggs.

###### Spoils

A slain king cobra with exceptional attributes can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following components useful in magic research:

* fangs (4/6 st., 45gp, *poison*)
* hood (4/6 st., 45gp,  *frighten humanoid*)
* tongue (4/6 st., 45gp, *snakes to staffs, staffs to snakes*)

If not used for magic research, a king cobra’s fangs fetch 4gp and weigh 1/6 st. Its venom (onset time 1d10 turns, +2 saving modifier, 4d6 {Po} damage on failed Death saving throw) fetches 250gp and weighs 1/6 st.

King cobras are the most intelligent of all snakes. Not only are they the only snake that constructs nests, they also can exhibit adaptable hunting strategies, navigate complex environments, and recognize individuals. Because of the king cobra’s trainability, many cultists of Iskara and Nasga breed and keep them in their temples.
