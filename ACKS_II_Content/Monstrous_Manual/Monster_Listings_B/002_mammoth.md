### Mammoth

Mammoths are northern cousins to elephants, adapted to colder climates by a thick coat of shaggy hair. They measure 23’ long and 13’ tall at the shoulder and weigh around 18,000 lbs. Unlike elephants, mammoths are highly aggressive and, some claim, carnivorous. Mammoths were long considered extinct by the sages of Aura, until mammoth-mounted Jutlanders invaded Dappakosea from the cold lands north of the Jutting Mountains.

###### Combat

Mammoths have **acute hearing** and **acute olfaction.** They gain a +2 bonus to avoid surprise in their natural habitat.

Mammoths prefer to start combat by **charging** with their tusks. The tusks deal double damage dice (4d6 {P!} each) when used in a charge.

If closely pressed, mammoths will attempt to **trample** their opponents (p. XX). A mammoth gains a +4 bonus to attack throws when attempting to trample a creature of large size or smaller. If struck, the creature takes damage must make a Paralysis saving throw or be forced aside 10’, landing **prone**. A small creature saves at -8. a man-sized creature at -6, and a large creature at -4. A mammoth can cleave after a successful trample attack that forces aside a creature.

###### Ecology

When mammoths are encountered, there is a 50% chance they will be a matriarchal herd. (Otherwise, it’s a bachelor herd.) In a matriarchal herd, the mammoths will be accompanied by 1d4 juvenile mammoths and 1d3 baby mammoths. Juvenile mammoths are huge size, have AC 4, Spd 90’, HD 7+2, and attack by trampling (4d4 {B!}). Juvenile mammoths can only take a +4 bonus versus and force aside small and man-sized creatures, which save at -6 and -4 respectively. Baby mammoths are large size, have AC 3, Spd 90’, HD 5, and attack by stomping (1d8 {B}).

###### Spoils

A slain mammoth can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following component useful in magic research:

* tusks (30 st, 1800gp, *call of the ancient tusk, force of impetus, striking*, armor +2, weapon +3)

If not used for magic research, a mammoth’s two tusks each fetch 2d4x100gp and weigh 1 st per 100gp value. A mammoth’s hide fetches 240gp and weighs 48 st.

Mammoths are much less agreeable than elephants to taking the yoke, but if tamed can be trained as powerful war mounts.

###### Lore

*The caverns that perforate the Jutting Mountains are extensively decorated with cave paintings, illustrations of such great antiquity that they must precede the Day Without Night. Among these paintings can be seen many beasts that are now extinct in Aurëpos, most notably the great tusked mammoth…*

* Del Morarin, *The Runestones of Mt. Skarstind*
