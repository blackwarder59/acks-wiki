### Rakshasa

Rakshasas are supernatural beings of Chaos sent by the Chthonic gods to bring suffering to the people of Somirea for turning their back on their worship. They delight in destruction and feasting upon the flesh of those who cross them. They particularly enjoy tormenting priests of Law, and actively desecrate graves, tear apart shrines, and otherwise bring ruin to such religious trappings as they encounter.

Ugly, ogre-sized humanoids, rakshasa have black skin, wild red hair, large curving fangs, wicked black claws, and eyes that glow like red embers. Despite this brutal appearance, they are sly, crafty creatures who dress in fine silks and ornaments, and freely associate with others of similarly evil bent, whether leading groups of malevolent intent, or following those more powerful than themselves.

###### Combat

The black claws of rakshasa are **venomous**. Any creature damaged by rakshasa claw must make a successful Death saving throw or die at the end of the rakshasa’s initiative.

Despite lacking wings, rakshasa can fly with great speed. They have a number of powerful **spell-like abilities**, all of which they can use at will: *discern good*, *inaudibility*, *invisibility*, *illusory terrain*, *spectral figment*, and *transform self.* They delight in using their abilities to masquerade as friends and family members of their unsuspecting victims.

Rakshasa are immune to all mundane physical damage and resistant to all mundane energy damage. As unholy beings, they can be detected with *discern evil*, held at bay by *holy circle* and destroyed with *dispel evil.* If summoned, they can be returned to their home spheres by *counterspell* or *dispel magic*.

###### Ecology

Rakshasa have no natural habitat on this sphere of existence. They often lurk in charnel grounds, unholy shrines, and other places of chaos and death, but sometimes reside in the teeming cities of Somirea, where they disguise themselves as ordinary citizens while pursuing their evil agenda.

###### Spoils

A slain rakshasa can be harvested with Alchemy 2 for the following components useful in magic research:

* brain (6 st, 360gp, *discern good*
* eyes (12 st, 720gp, *inaudibility, invisibility*)
* hair (12 st, 720gp, *flight*)
* heart (12 st, 720gp, *illusory terrain, spectral figment*)
* ichor (18 5/6 st., 1,130gp, *adjust self, poison, transform self*)

A rakshasa’s two claws each fetch 12gp and weigh 1/6 st. Its venom (onset time 1 round, +1 saving throw modifier, 10d6 {Po} damage on failed saving throw) fetches 800gp and weighs 1/6 st.
