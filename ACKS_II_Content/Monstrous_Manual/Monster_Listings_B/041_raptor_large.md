### Raptor, Large

Raptors are birds of prey renowned throughout Aurëpos for their keen vision, swift dives, and sharp talons. Eagles, falcons, hawks, owls, and vultures are all types of raptor. Large raptors include the black vultures, griffon vultures, imperial eagles, lappet-faced vultures, martial eagles, mountain condors, and other formidable birds of prey. They weigh about 30 - 35 lbs and measure around 4’ in length with 10’ to 12’ wingspans.

###### Combat

Raptors have **acute vision** and **alertness**, granting them a +2 bonus to avoid surprise in their natural habitat.

Their preferred attack is a **dive attack** with their talons. A dive attack inflicts double the normal damage (2d2/2d2). If the raptor hits a creature smaller than itself with both its talons while making a dive attack, the creature must make a size-adjusted Paralysis saving throw. If the save fails, the creature is **grabbed**.

Certain types of large raptors have additional abilities.

* **Mountain Condor/Vultures:** These soaring birds only have a speed of 150’/450’ instead of 180’/480’. However, However, they have **acute olfaction** to smell carrion. As scavengers, they are **immune** to mundane disease and mundane poisonous damage.

###### Ecology

When large raptors are encountered in their aerie, there is a 35% chance each raptor is guarding eggs or juveniles. Roll 1d10 for age and number: 1 they’re 1d6 eggs, 2-10 they’re 1d2 juvenile raptors. Juvenile raptors of ordinary size have AC 1, Spd 30’, 1 hp, ML -4, and do not fight. Large raptor eggs have 1 hp and weigh 1/50 st.

###### Spoils

A slain large raptor with exceptional attributes can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following components useful in magic research:

* tail feathers (1/6 st, 11gp, *flight, lay of the land*)
* talons (1/6 st, 10gp, *sharpness, striking*)

A large raptor’s 6d10 flight feathers each fetch 1d3sp and weigh 1/150 st.

Large raptors are sometimes trained, though not so often as their smaller cousins.

###### Lore

*When Audarius Valerian was appointed Exarch, he mustered the surviving legions of Aura to hear him. “Henceforth, we shall no longer fear Baal,” he proclaimed. “Henceforth, Baal shall fear us.” And he ordered the army due south, intent to offer battle.*

*After several days hard marching, the Aurans came to the Fords of the Petrivor, where Baal’s army had deployed The Exarch’s war council cautioned him against attacking Baal across the river, and he might have heeded them had he not espied, soaring over the Petrivor, a pair of majestic imperial eagles.*

*The eagle was the standard of the House Valerian, and so the Exarch took this as a high omen, and thus gave battle.*

*Valerian triumphed in what became known as the Battle of the Eagles; and following the victory, he adopted the name Tarkaun, which then meant “eagle” in the Classical tongue, and today means “emperor.”*

* Tatian, *Epic of Audarius Valerian*
