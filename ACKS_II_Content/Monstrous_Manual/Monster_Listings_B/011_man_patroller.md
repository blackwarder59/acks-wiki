### Man, Patroller

Patrollers are organized groups of soldiers dispatched to keep order in the civilized realms of Aurëpos.

###### Combat

25% of patrollers will be veterans with 1 HD. The remaining 75% will be regulars with 1-1 HD. The veterans have **combat reflexes** that grants +1 initiative bonus and are **skilled warriors** who gain a +1 damage bonus.

The equipment carried by patrollers will depend on terrain type. Patrollers encountered in barrens, desert, grassland, hills, or shrubland will be equipped with lances, swords, shields, lamellar armor, and leather-barded medium warhorses or war camels. Patrollers encountered in forests or mountains will be equipped with composite bows, short swords, and leather armor, and not mounted.

###### Ecology

Each patrol will be led by one 2nd level fighter. Each band will be led by one 3rd level fighter. A patroller camp or outpost will be captained by a 6th level fighter. As long as the captain is alive, the patrollers will gain a +2 bonus to morale rolls.

When patrollers are encountered in a camp, certain additional creatures will be present. The captain will employ 3 4th level explorers or thieves as scouts. There is a 50% chance a 5th level crusader will be accompanying the patrollers as a healer or undead slayer. There is a 50% chance a 5th level mage will accompany the patrollers to provide magical support.

Patroller leaders will be equipped in the same manner as their patrols. The leaders of forest and mountain patrollers have a 25% chance to be explorers rather than fighters. Leaders should be assigned magic items using the ***ACKS II JJ***rules (p. XX).

###### Spoils

A slain patroller can be harvested for the following component useful in magic research:

* heart (1/6 st, 5gp or 10gp, *beguile humanoid*)

Patrollers do not have magic items by treasure type. Instead, patroller leaders should be assigned magic items using the ***ACKS II JJ***rules (p. XX), whether they are in lair or not.

###### Notes

This monster listing is just an example. It assumes patrollers are regular mercenaries (0th level) equipped as medium cavalry or composite bowmen. It should not be construed to mean that patrollers can never be 1st level veterans or cannot be light infantry, heavy infantry, or other types. The Judge can and should stock his wilderness with patrollers that are trained and equipped in sensible ways for his campaign!

In ***Domains at War*** terms, patrollers are classified as elite veteran or regular composite bowmen and/or medium cavalry.
