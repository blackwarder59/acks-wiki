### Man, Merchant

Merchants trade goods over great distances. When the Auran Empire was its height, it was said that a solitary merchant could trek from Alakyrum to Arganos without ever risking an encounter with bandits or brigands. In this benighted era, merchants must organize into caravans for safety, and hire many guards outside of the most civilized territory.

###### Combat

Merchants prefer diplomacy to battle. If forced to fight, merchants will be equipped with crossbow, short sword, dagger, and chainmail armor.

While not particularly effective or dangerous combatants, merchants are highly practiced at **treachery**. They can force creatures they encounter to make surprise rolls at a -3 penalty by treacherously attacking during parley.

###### Ecology

For protection in their long overland journeys, merchants organize into large caravans consisting of 10-40 large wagons. Each wagon will be drawn by four heavy draft horses and driven by one merchant. Every merchant caravan will be led by a mercantilist (5th level venturer) who owns the caravan and employs the other merchants. The mercantilist will be equipped with crossbow, short sword, dagger, and chainmail armor.

Merchant caravans encountered outside of civilized territory will be protected by caravan guards. Every 10 wagons will be defended by a band of 15 0th level guards and 5 1st level fighters, led by one 3rd level and three 2nd level fighters. 50% of caravan guards will be equipped with crossbows, swords, shields, and chainmail armor, and seated on the wagons. lances, swords, shields, lamellar armor, and leather-barded medium warhorses or war camels. Use the characteristics for patrollers (p. XX).

If merchants are encountered on a river, substitute a convoy of 1-4 large barges for a caravan of 10-40 large wagons. Each barge will have 10 merchants with Seafaring crewing it and (outside of civilized territory) will have a compliment of marines (15 0th level, 5 1st, 3 2nd, 1 3rd) guarding it.

###### Spoils

A slain merchant can be harvested with Healing 1 for the following component useful in magic research:

* heart (1/6 st, 6gp, *beguile humanoid*)

Merchants do not have magic items by treasure type. Instead, merchant leaders should be assigned magic items using the ***ACKS II JJ***rules (p. XX), whether they are in lair or not.

In lieu of rolling for treasure type, the Judge can assign cargo to the caravan. There will be 3,200 st of cargo per 10 wagons (or large barge). Cargo will generally be a mix of common and precious merchandise with an average value of 1gp per stone. For each wagon, roll for one type of cargo on the Random Merchandise table from ***ACKS II RR***p. XX. (For your convenience we’ve re-printed it on the adjoining page.)

###### Notes

This monster listing is just an example. It assumes merchants are 1st level venturers. It should not be construed to mean that merchants can never be 0th level or noncombatant characters, that leveled characters of other classes cannot be merchants, or that mercenary guards can’t carry other equipment.
