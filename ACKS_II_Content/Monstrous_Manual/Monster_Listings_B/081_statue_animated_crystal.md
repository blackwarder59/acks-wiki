### Statue, Animated Crystal

Statues of various materials can be made into constructs by powerful spellcasters. Those sculpted from crystal appear as smoothly-carved humas or demi-humans, standing about 6’ tall and weighing about 500 lbs.

###### Combat

Unless they engage in some form of movement, animated crystal statues appear to be normal statues even upon close inspection. Characters encountering stationary animated statues suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls.

In combat, animated crystal statues strike with their fists for 1d6 {B} damage.

Animated crystal statues are **immune** to enchantment effects, necrotic damage, and poisonous damage. As constructs, they count as enchanted creatures for purposes of spells such as *dispel evil*and *holy circle*.

###### Ecology

As constructs, animated crystal statues have no natural habitat. They can be found guarding ancient treasures, dwarven vaults, or places of power or serving powerful spellcasters.

###### Spoils

A destroyed crystal statue can be harvested with Magical Engineering for the following component useful in magic research:

* crystal skull (1 stone, 65gp, *divine armor, holy circle*)

###### Encounter

A narrow cave mouth perforates the side of a nearby hill. Adventurers who squeeze through the narrow rift find themselves, not in a limestone cavern, but in a spectacular egg-shaped geode cavity where great shards of scintillating crystal jut from the walls the teeth of some monstrous maw. Those able to sense power will instantly recognize that they have entered an **enduring edifice of elemental earth**.

However, the edifice has been damaged. The far wall of the cavity, opposite the entrance, shows signs of having been excavated, with jagged gouges and bare patches of rock. The fruit of that excavations stands in the center of the geodesic: a crystal statue chiseled to resemble a stately elven lord. Scattered around the feet of the statue are ancient bones and rusty sculptor’s tools.

The bones are all that remains of the mage who excavated and sculpted the crystal. He had hoped to make it into an **animated crystal statue**, but he died of old age before completing the project. The unfathomable power of elemental earth finished the job for him. The statue will attack any beings who touch the crystals in the cave.
