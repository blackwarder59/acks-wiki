### Varmint, Giant Rat

Giant rats are omnivorous rodents that thrive on human trash on the fringes of dwellings. The smallest are 3' long and 33 lbs., but rodents of unusually large size are not unknown. They are adept swimmers who are at home in sewers, water-filled caverns, and marshes.

###### Combat

Giant rats have **acute hearing** and gain a +1 bonus to avoid surprise in its natural habitat. They are **skilled climbers**, able to ascend sheer surfaces as if they were thieves (5+).

Giant rats **fear fire** and must make morale rolls each round any of the pack or horde is burned with torches or oil.

There is a 25% chance a pack or horde of giant rats is carrying a **deadly disease** which can infect creatures they bite. If so, the Judge will choose or roll for a disease on the Disease Type table (p. XX) and apply its effects to any creature damaged by the rats’ bites.

###### Ecology

When giant rats are encountered in a wilderness nest, the rats will be rearing 1d100 juvenile rats and 1d100 baby rats, collectively represented as a **rat swarm** with 1HD per 50 offspring (minimum 2 HD).

###### Spoils

A sl can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following component useful in magic research:

* tail (1/6 st., 5gp, *cause disease, cure disease, delay disease, plague*)

A giant rat's pelt fetches 1gp and weighs 1/6 st.

Giant rats are rarely trained, although from time to time a clever thief has found a use for them.

###### Encounter

A dark alley [canal if in river terrain], filled with trash [detritus if in river terrain], has become the den for a plague of **25 giant rats**. These rats have created a complex, maze-like nest from the heaps of filth and rotted crates and barrels strewn through the alley.

**Giant rats (25):** Spd 120’/60’ swim, AC 2, HD ½, hp 3 each, #AT 1 (bite 10+), Dmg 1d3 {P} + disease, Save F1, ML 0, AL N, XP 5; Special: disease carrier, fear fire

Among the filth can be found a set of thieves’ tools wrapped in oilskin (25gp), a pouch holding 2 lbs of comfrey (20gp, 2/6 st), a silver dagger (30gp), a scrimshaw drinking horn (40gp), and a cracked vase of Tirenean blown-glass (70gp, 1/6 st).
