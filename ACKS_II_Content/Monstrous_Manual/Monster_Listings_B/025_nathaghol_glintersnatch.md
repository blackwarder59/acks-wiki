### Nathaghol (Glintersnatch)

In the tombs of the great sorcerers of ancient Zahar, as well as in the silent vaults of their paramours and valued servants, great gleaming treasure hoards were buried by the sides of the butchered slaves who bore them deep into the gloom and darkness. There these treasures were to remain, sealed within until the bleak re-birth of the dead foretold by the Zaharan Deathspeakers and Eunuch-Priests. But, as in every land and every time, the lure and lay of this buried wealth proved too great for the greedy, the foolhardy, the heedless, the desperate, and the foolish to resist. A frightful fate awaited those caught trespassing in the tombs of the Zaharans – transformation into a nathaghol. The grisly punishment, laid down by the followers of Kaleth and Ravanor, only bolstered the grim reputation of Zahar as a wellspring of malice, cruelty, and sadistic cunning.

The nathaghol, sometimes called glintersnatches in the common tongue of the Auran Empire, linger to this day in crumbling vaults and lost, forsaken places. Sentenced to deathlessness for their crimes of avarice against Zahar, these warped aberrations now use the greed of ages to lure others into death.

At one time a nathaghol was humanoid, but now it is nothing near. A lidless, eyeless face sniffs vainly in the darkness, with flensed flesh peeled back from its gaping mouth and nose. A now-distended jaw allows for the unnatural feeding of coins and jewels into the creature’s blackened, snaggle-toothed maw. Flayed and oozing skin hugs tightly to cracked and oddly angled bones that creak and whine even as the abomination shuffles along in a hunched, awkward, unnatural gait. A wheezing, unholy breath resembling the sound of shifting coins in an overfull sack sounds balefully when the monster becomes excited or exerts itself.

###### Combat

Nathaghol possess a dreadful strength and an awful cunning, and these creatures can **climb, hide**, and **sneak** as 7th level thieves. They can cast **locate object** at will, but only to locate coins, gems, jewelry, or magical items.

Nathaghol **hunger for coins, gems, jewelry, and magical items.** Oftentimes they suckle, chew, and swallow such items they happen upon, which then work their way euphorically yet painfully through the nathaghol’s body in 1d4 turns, dropping beneath them as it passes through. If they ingest a gem, piece of jewelry, or small magical item, they **regenerate** 3 hit points per round for as long as the item works through its body.

A nathaghol lacks the standard senses of living or even undead creatures. It can only “see” or “smell” beings carrying wealth – coins, gems, jewelry, or magical items.

Even silver thread or a gold button will be sniffed out by the nathaghol and rouse its unnatural hunger. However, a creature carrying no treasure at all is invisible to a nathaghol and typically irrelevant to it.

Once per day the nathaghol can use a full-round action to physically **tear open its own belly** to retrieve a previously swallowed bit of treasure. It can then place the recovered coin, gem, or jewel in a desired location or hurl it at a target or spot. The time spent in the nathaghol’s belly gives the treasure a dark and powerful **curse**.

Any living creature within 60’ who gazes upon the cursed treasure must make a Spells saving throw. If the save succeeds, the creature is not affected by the treasure’s curse. If the save fails, the creature is overcome with a selfish, cruel, and ravenous desire to possess the cursed treasure. An affected creature with rivals for the treasure will scheme, fight, or even kill their erstwhile friends to gain the precious treasure. An affected creature with no remaining rivals will take a full-round action to swallow the treasure. When ingested, the cursed wealth turns to acid in the creature’s belly, deals 6d6 extraordinary acidic damage and destroying the treasure.

The first time each day a nathaghol takes slashing damage, 1d6 **cursed pieces of treasure fall from its body** in a jingling clatter. When this occurs, each living creature within 60’must make a number of saving throws equal to the number of coins falling from the wound, with effects as above.

A nathaghol’s treasure remains **cursed** and dangerous from the time it leaves their body until the rising of the next dawn. A *remove curse* cast on the treasure or affected creature cleanses it, as does completely submerging the treasure in holy water for one round.

As undead, nathaghol are **immune** to enchantment effects, necrotic damage, and poisonous damage. They are inherently evil for purposes of *discern evil*and *holy circle*spells. They are rebuked as vampires.
