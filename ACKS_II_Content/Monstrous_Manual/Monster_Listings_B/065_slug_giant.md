### Slug, Giant

Giant slugs are enormous gastropods. A typical giant slug measures 20’ long and weighs 7,200 lbs, but some grow to twice that length and eight times the mass. They are pale gray in color with a dull white underbelly, and possess a single pair of long, thin tentacles which can detect light, heat, and scent. Their ribbon-like mouths reveal rows of small, sharp teeth. They are found in moist or wet environments such as swamps, marshes, rain forests, and dungeons.

A giant slug moves by contracting and expanding its muscular “foot” over a large slime trail that reduces friction. It can squeeze its squishy, flexible body into corridors as narrow as 5’ wide, though this may prevent it turning around. They are both scavengers and predators, feeding on both plants and animals.

###### Combat

Giant slugs have **acute olfaction** and gain a +1 bonus to avoid surprise in their native habitat. In combat, they can bite for 1d12 {P!} damage or **spit acid** to a range of 60’ for 5d8 {A!{ damage.

A slug leaves a **trail of wet** **slime** on the ground behind it wherever it moves. The trail dries after 1 round. While wet it is highly slippery (as a *slickness* spell). The dried trail can be tracked automatically by characters with Tracking proficiency, and on 4+ by those without.

Due to their squishy bodies, giant slugs are **immune** to mundane bludgeoning damage. They are **susceptible** to seismic damage, which tends to splatter them into thousands of slimy gibbets. They save against seismic damage at a -2 penalty and suffer double damage dice.

Salt has a deadly desiccating effect on slugs. A 1lb bag of salt (thrown like a vial of oil) deals 1d8 {N} damage to a slug for 2 rounds on a direct hit or 1d3 {N} damage on a splash.

Giant slug are **attracted by beer**. When at least 5 st. of beer is within 240’, a giant slug will move towards the beer and begin to consume it. If attacked, it will retaliate, but otherwise will take no action until the beer is consumed (which takes 1 turn). Conversely, they are **repelled by copper**. 1,500cp will suffice to form a 5’ x 6” wide barrier that a slug will not cross.

###### Ecology

Giant slugs are hermaphroditic egg-layers that do not establish nests or exhibit any parental care for their offspring. After mating, the slug simply deposits its eggs in a moist, hidden place such as a tree hollow or leaf pile. Giant slug eggs have 1 hp and weight 1/6 st.

###### Spoils

A slain giant slug can be harvested with Animal Husbandry 2 for the following components useful in magic research:

* acid glands (10 st, 600gp, *rain of vitriol, vitriolic infusion*)
* mucous glands (10 st., 600gp, *slickness*, *summon ooze*)
