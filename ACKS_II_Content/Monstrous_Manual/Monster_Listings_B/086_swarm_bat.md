### Swarm, Bat

A bat swarm is a large mass of flying, flapping, biting bats. A bat swarm might be roused if its nest or feeding ground is invaded, if it is presented with strange smells or bright lights, or if summoned by magic.

###### Combat

Bat swarms are **prone to flight** and the swarm must make a morale roll at the end of every round of any combat.

Bat swarms do not so much attack as simply engulf everything in their path. Any creature that starts its initiative in the swarm’s area, or enters the swarm on its initiative, is **engulfed.**

A creature engulfed by a bat swarm must make a Paralysis saving throw at the end of its initiative. If the save fails, the creature suffers 1d6 {P} damage and is **mad** (as the spell *incite madness*) on its next initiative. If, on its initiative, the engulfed creature uses its movement action to flee from the swarm at least 20’, or uses its combat action to ward off the swarm with a torch or weapon, it gains a +4 bonus on its saving throw. Warding off a bat swarm with a torch or weapon deals 1d4 damage to the swarm.

The engulfed condition ends when the creature starts its initiative outside the area of the swarm.

Bat swarms are **immune** to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, except when dealt by creatures warding off the bats (e.g. the bat swarm cannot be directly attacked as a target).

###### Ecology

Bat swarms are commonly found in abandoned belfries and towers, caverns, forests, jungles and other environments favored by bats.

###### Spoils

Bat swarms do not yield any spoils except meat. One day their guano will be valuable, but that day is not today.

###### Encounter

A funnel-shaped pit entrance on the lower slopes of a mountain, 40’ in diameter, descends downward 154’ feet before opening up into a cavernous vault, 1,000’ long, 200’ wide, and 80’ high. The ceiling of this vast cave is adorned with beautiful tubular stalactites, which hang like icicles between larger floor-to-ceiling columns. A roost of **three huge bat swarms** makes its lair in this cavern. The bats emerge at sunset and return at sunrise. If characters are ascending or descending the 154’ shaft during this time, they will be caught within the swarm, and will fall if they fail their saving throw.

**Huge bat swarms (3):** Spd 15’ / 120’ fly, AC 2, HD 4\*, hp 24, 21, 17, #AT 1 (engulf), Dmg 1d6 {P} + mad, Save F0, ML -2, AL N, XP 135; Special: prone to flight, swarm immunities
