### Spider, Giant Black Widow

Nasga, goddess of beauty and pain, bred the first giant spiders to help weave her web of suffering across the world. They are found in desolate ruins, dungeons, and forsaken wilderness throughout Aurëpos, Danae, and Ulruk.

The giant black widow is perhaps the most feared of its kind. Like its ordinary sibling, the giant black widow has a glossy black chitinous carapace marked with a red design resembling an hourglass on its ventral abdomen – but it measures 6' long and weighs 240 lbs.

###### Combat

Giant black widows are highly territorial and **very aggressive**. Characters encountering them suffer a -2 penalty on reaction rolls.

Giant black widows often spin webs in strategic locations around their lairs. They use these webs to entangle victims in their webs in order to capture them and keep them fresh for later consumption. They can also spin a web around a target as a melee attack. If a creature moves into a black widow’s web, it automatically becomes **webbed.** The black widows’ **webbed mechanoreception** enables them to “see” any creatures touching their webs.

Their bites carry a lethal **venom.** A creature damaged by a black widow’s bite must make a Death saving throw. If the save fails, the creature dies of poison after 1 turn.

###### Ecology

When a wilderness den of giant black widows is encountered, there is a 5% chance per spider that it will have constructed an egg sac containing 2d6+1 eggs. The eggs have 1 hp and weigh 1/12 st. Spiderlings disperse after birth and are not found in the den.

###### Spoils

A giant black widow corpse can be harvested with Animal Husbandry 2 for the following components useful in magic research:

* mandibles (2/6 st, 20gp, *poison*)
* leg tarsus (2/6 st, 25gp, *spider climb*)
* spinneret (2/6 st, 20gp, *webbing*)

If not used for magic research, a giant black widow’s mandibles fetch 12gp and weigh 1/6 st. Its venom (onset time 1d4 turns, +2 saving throw modifier, 4d4 {Po} damage on failed Death saving throw) fetches 250gp and weighs 1/6 st.

Like all arachnids, giant black widows are cunning enough to learn but so hostile as to be almost untrainable.
