### Man, Pirate

At the height of the Auran Empire’s power, piracy had almost been eliminated from the Ammasaurëan Sea, but with the empire’s decline pirates have become an ever-present menace that threatens coastal towns and merchant ships alike. Both coasts of Ulrukan are also plagued by pirates, some of whom sail through the Pillars of Dawn or the Straits of Kem to raid Aurëpos. Pirates commonly dock in the increasingly-lawless ports of the Syrnasos Islands, Corcano, and Jutland.

Most (70%) of pirates are Chaotic-aligned buccaneers who will prey on any and every ship they encounter but a minority (30%) are Neutral-aligned privateers, who will only attack ships sailing under the flags of their nation’s enemies.

###### Combat

All pirates are **elite marines** and can flexibly function as sailors, rowers, or marines, as needed. As **swashbuckling men of action**, they gain a +1 bonus to AC in light armor. They are **skilled warriors** who gain a +1 damage bonus.

Pirates serving as rowers or sailors will be equipped with short swords, daggers, and leather armor. Pirates serving as marines will also be equipped with shortbows, grappling hooks, and 50’ ropes. They will have one boarding ramp per 8 marines (rounded up).

Pirates usually attempt to capture, not sink, their targets, because their galleys do not have the cargo capacity to carry the plunder. Buccaneers (chaotic pirates) will usually attempt to capture any sailing ships they encounter. The reaction roll will determine whether they immediately attack with murderous intent or offer a chance to surrender first. Buccaneers will not usually attack galleys (they’re too well-armed and dangerous). Privateers will attack both galleys and sailing ships of enemy realms.

When they find a suitable target, pirates will approach under sail and oar at full speed, with on-deck marines volleying missile fire at any exposed crew.

When they pull adjacent to the target, the on-deck marines will attempt to board by grapple line or ramp, with successive waves from below deck marines, rowers, and sailors (in that order).

###### Ecology

Because pirates use fast, shallow-drafted galleys to pursue their targets, they can be found on any navigable body of water, whether lake, sea, or river.

When a group of pirates are encountered, use the Lair roll to determine whether they are organized into a flotilla of 1 to 3 vessels or a fleet of 2 to 8 vessels. Then roll 1d10: On a 1-5, the pirates are out raiding; 6-9, the pirates are returning home with captured booty; 10, the pirates are docked at a (possibly uncharted) cove, island, islet, reef, or river bank.

Roll 1d6 on the table below to determine the type of galleys the pirates field – either 1.5- or 2.5-rowers. The number of pirates encountered is then determined by the type of vessels, the number of vessels, and the crew requirements for the vessels.

The pirates will be assigned to the various rolls of marines, rowers, and sailors as shown. Note that some marines will be on deck and others below deck, noted as [on deck]/[below deck].

|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Roll | Galley | # Vessels | Sailors | Rowers | Marines |
| 1-4 | 1.5-Rower | 1d3 / 1d8 | 5 | 50 | 5 / 15 |
| 5-6 | 2.5-Rower | 1d2 / 1d6 | 5 | 50 | 10 / 25 |

Each vessel will be led by a 5th level pirate master, accompanied by two 4th level pirate mates. Pirate flotillas, and pirate fleets of less than 350 pirates, will be led by a 6th level pirate captain, who will replace one of the vessel’s masters. Pirate fleets of 350 or more will be led by a pirate king of 7th level. A pirate king will always have a chief mate of 6th level and will have a 75% chance of employing a mage of level 4+1d3.

Mates, masters, captains, and kings are usually fighters but they can also be barbarians, explorers, ruinguards, or even venturers. Pirate masters and captains will have two ranks of Seafaring, while pirate kings will be master mariners with three ranks of Seafaring. Pirate mates will have either two ranks of Seafaring, one rank of Seafaring and Navigation, or three ranks of Craft (shipwright).

###### Spoils

A slain pirate can be harvested for the following component useful in magic research:

* heart (1/6 st, 10gp, *beguile humanoid*)

When pirates are encountered out raiding (not in their lair), they typically do not have any treasure -- that’s why they are out raiding! When pirates are encountered returning home, each vessel has a 25% chance to have recently captured a merchant mariner vessel. If so, part of the pirate crew will be sailing the captured vessel (along with its captured crew and cargo), back home. Use the Man, Merchant Mariner entry to roll up the captured ship. Pirates returning home with captured ships will attempt to evade combat.

When pirates are encountered docked, each vessel will have treasure type J. In addition, the fleet will have 1d4 hostages for every 50 pirates. Hostages can be rolled up as random NPCs using the tables in the ***ACKS II JJ***(p. XX). Hostages can be ransomed or returned to their homes.

However, pirates never have magic items by treasure type. Instead, pirate leaders should be assigned magic items using the ***ACKS II JJ***rules (p. XX), whether they are in lair or not.

###### Notes

This monster listing is just an example. It should not be construed to mean that all pirates are 0th level mercenaries who fight with dual weapons and have Swashbuckling proficiency. The Judge can and should stock his seas with other pirates that are trained and equipped in sensible ways for his campaign!
