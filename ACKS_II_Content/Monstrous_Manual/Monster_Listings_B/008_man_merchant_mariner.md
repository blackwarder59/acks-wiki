### Man, Merchant Mariner

Despite the dangerous surge in piracy, the waters of the Ammas Aurë remain the most important medium of commerce and trade. Merchant mariners sail regularly between the great commercial hubs such as Aura, Uttar, and Zidium as well as countless smaller ports-of-call.

###### Combat

Merchant mariners prefer to avoid combat. If pressed into battle, they will be equipped with either clubs or hand axes. 10% of sailors will have nets.

###### Ecology

When merchant mariners are encountered, use the Lair roll to determine whether the mariners are crewing a solitary vessel or a fleet of vessels. In either case, merchant mariners encountered on lakes or rivers will be in barges while merchant mariners encountered on high seas will be in sailing ships. Roll 1d10 to determine the size of the barge or ships. The number of sailors, passengers, and merchants encountered, as well as the captain’s level, volume of cargo carried, is determined by the type of vessel, the number of vessels, and the crew requirements for the vessels.

|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Roll | Waters | Vessel | Fleet Size | Sailors |
| 1-6 | River/lake | Small barge | 4d6 | 5 |
| 7-9 | River/lake | Large barge | 2d6 | 10 |
| 10 | River/lake | Huge barge | 1d2 | 50 |
| 1-5 | Sea | Small ship | 1d12 | 10 |
| 6-8 | Sea | Large ship | 1d6 | 20 |
| 9-10 | Sea | Huge ship | 1d3 | 40 |

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Vessel | Passengers | Cargo | Merchant Lvl |
| Small barge | 2d6-1 | 4d6 x 100 st | 1st |
| Large barge | 6d6 | 3d4 x 700 st | 2nd |
| Huge barge | 2d6x60 | 3d6 x 10,000 st | 5th |
| Small ship | 6d10 | 3d4 x 1000 st | 1st |
| Large ship | 2d8x10 | 6d6 x 1000 st | 4th |
| Huge ship | 4d6x10 | 7d10 x 1000 st | 5th |

As parts of its crew, each vessel will have a sailing master (0th level specialist with two ranks of Seafaring) and a navigator (0th level specialist with one rank of Seafaring and one rank of Navigation).

Each vessel will carry one merchant captain of between 1st and 5th level depending on type. Merchant mariner fleets will be led by a merchant commodore two levels higher than the merchant captains. Merchant captains and commodores are usually venturers, but can also be explorers, fighters, thieves, bards, or even barbarians. Captains will have two ranks of Seafaring, while commodores will be master mariners with three ranks of Seafaring.

Roll 1d10 to determine the type of passengers being transported: 1-6 commoners, 7-9 pilgrims, 10 marines. Commoners will be 50% noncombatants. Marines can be heavy infantry, light infantry, or composite bowmen.

###### Spoils

A slain merchant mariner with Healing 1 can be harvested for the following component useful in magic research:

* heart (1/6 st, 6gp, *beguile humanoid*)

Merchant mariner captains and commodores should be assigned magic items using the ***ACKS II JJ***rules (p. XX).

The spoils of a merchant marine fleet are found in its passengers (who can be held for ransom or sold into slavery) and cargo. Cargo will generally be a mix of common and precious merchandise with an average value of 1gp per stone. For each die rolled for cargo volume, roll for one type of cargo:

###### Notes

This monster listing is just an example. It assumes merchant mariners are 0th level sailors led by a small number of experienced venturers. It should not be construed to mean that merchant mariners can never be 1st level characters, or that leveled characters of other classes cannot be present.
