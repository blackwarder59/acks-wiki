### Shark, Great White

These immense sharks are silvery-grey with white bellies. They can reach lengths exceeding 20' and can weigh over 4,000 lbs. Vicious and predatory, great white sharks will attack virtually anything, including small boats.

###### Combat

Great white sharks have a lateral line system that affords them **aquatic mechanoreception**. They can “see” in water up to 180’ by sensing changes in water current and water pressure. They also have **acute olfaction** granting them a +1 bonus to avoid surprise in their native habitat. They can sense blood in the water to a range of 300’. They also

Once they sense blood, they become **furious feeders** and will fight to the death without making morale rolls.

Due to their massive jaws, great white sharks can deliver **vicious bites**. A creature bitten with an attack throw of unmodified 20 must make a Death saving throw. If the save succeeds, the bite inflicts double damage dice (4d10 {P!}). If the save fails, the bite inflicts triple damage dice (6d10 {P!}) and the creature loses a limb. Roll 1d6 to determine which limb is lost: 1-2 weapon hand, 3 weapon arm, 4-5 near leg, 6 far leg. A character who loses a limb cannot be healed above 1 hp until he receives 2 weeks of bed rest.

###### Ecology

Great white sharks are solitary apex predators. However, they are often found in groups in abundant feeding grounds. Like other sharks, great whites give birth to live young. The pups are immediately independent and receive no parental care.

###### Spoils

A slain great white shark with exceptional attributes can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following components useful in magic research:

* tail (8 2/6 st, 500gp, *righteous wrath, swimming*)
* skull (10 st, 600gp, *sharpness,* weapon +3)

A great white shark's armored hide fetches 175gp and weighs 11 st. A great white shark’s fangs fetch 20gp and weigh 2/6 st.

###### Lore

*When Tychado, the king of Tritons, won victory over the Selacharim host, he claimed for himself their princess Dimeritia and made of her his wife; for Tychado unwisely thought that their child could unify their warring peoples. But the blood of Lammala ran in the veins of the royal line of the Selacharim, and it fouled the womb. The child that Dimeritia birthed was neither Triton nor Selacharim, but rather a monster of fin and fang, an eater of men that lusted for blood. Horrified by what Dimeritia had birthed, Tychado struck her down, then seized the child, and hurled it into the black waters of the Tehonaurë. But as she lay dying Dimeritia blessed her child, prophesying it would sire many children that who would bring fear to the Tritons for as long as they dwelled in the depths.*
