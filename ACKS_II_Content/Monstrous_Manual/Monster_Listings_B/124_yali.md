### Yali

Primarily found in Somirea, these awe-inspiring creatures resemble huge majestic lions, 6’ at the shoulder, with short elephant-like tusks enhancing an already terrible bite.

Unlike lions, yali are semi-sapient, with an intelligence similar to that of a gorilla or parrot. They often serve as sentinels and guard-beasts capable of defending temples of Lawful gods from wicked interlopers. They are famed for their devoted loyalty to their masters and steadfast resolve to confront evil, and can only be trained and handled by Lawful creatures.

###### Combat

Yali have the natural ability to **discern evil** (as the spell) at all times. They are instinctively aggressive towards beings sensed as evil, and attack them immediately unless instructed to do otherwise.

Yali also have **acute hearing** and **olfaction** granting them a +2 bonus to avoid surprise in their natural habitat. They can track the scent of creatures for up to 6 miles with the equivalent of three ranks of Tracking proficiency. They are **quite agile** (Acrobatics 12+) and **good climbers**, able to ascend sheer surfaces as if they were thieves (6+). Their **lightning reflexes** grant a +1 bonus to initiative.

In lieu of biting, yali can lash an opponent with their long, serpentine tails. If a yali’s tail attack succeeds, the target is **restrained**.

###### Ecology

When yali are encountered in a wilderness den, the adults will be raising yali cubs. Roll 1d10 for age and number: 1-6, 1d3-1 juvenile yali, 7-10 1d3 baby yali. Juvenile yali have AC 3, Spd 120’, HD 4+2, and attack with 2 claws (1d4 {S!}) and a bite (1d10 {P!}). Baby yali have AC 2, Spd 120’, HD 3, and attack with 2 claws (1d2 {S}) and a bite (1d4 {P}).

###### Spoils

A slain yali can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the following components useful in magic research:

* heart (6 4/6 st, 400gp, *discern evil, invuln. to evil*)
* tail (6 4/6 st, 400gp, *halt humanoid, halt monster*)
* tusks (8 2/6 st, 500gp, *striking,* weapon +2)

If not used for magic research, a yali’s two tusks each fetch 1d4 x 25gp and weigh 1 stone for every 450gp value. Its pelt fetches 135gp and weighs 2 2/6 st.

Because of the intense devotion they develop for their masters, yali can only be trained by monster whispering.
