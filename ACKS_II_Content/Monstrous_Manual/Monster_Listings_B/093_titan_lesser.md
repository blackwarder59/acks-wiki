### Titan, Lesser

The sage of the Auran Empire believe that the titans are the primordial offspring of the gods – some say the illicit offspring of Türas and Telith, others fastened by the will of Ammonar, only to be cast down to earth when they threatened his power. The titans themselves claim that they sprang from blood shed by the gods during the battle for the Tablet of Destiny. Whatever their origin, the titans are an awe-inspiring and powerful race taller and nobler than giants.

Lesser titans stand 20’ tall and weigh 5,000lbs with bronze or silver hair and skin in tones of blue ranging from nearly white to cold light blue. They dress in flowing clothing and fancy jewelry. In battle, they favor tall spears or gleaming maces.

Lesser titans always speak Common, Classical Auran, and 1d4 other tongues, often ancient or dead languages.

###### Combat

Titans can smash with their fists or with weapons for extraordinary damage. When smashing with piercing or slashing weapons, titans deliver **vicious blows** that deal an additional 6 points per smash. When smashing with bludgeoning weapons, titans can **topple and fling** large or smaller creatures with every attack (p. XX). The creature struck must make a successful size-adjusted Paralysis saving throw or be knocked prone and forced back a number of feet equal to the damage dealt. The titan can cleave if the creature fails its save against his smash.

Instead of smashing, titans can hurl boulders to a distance of 1200’, dealing 4d6 {B!} damage in a 5’ radius to the impact point. When hurling a boulder, a titan functions like a heavy ballista using the rules for Missile Attacks with Artillery (***ACKS II RR****,* p. XX). However, the titan does not need to reload, so it can throw a boulder each round if it has sufficient ammo.

There is a 20% chance each lesser titan will have Mage abilities at level 2d6.

###### Ecology

Though sometimes found in dungeons, lesser titans usually dwell in mountain citadels on high peaks or in sky-castles atop clouds. They protect their lairs with trained creatures of various types: in a mountain citadel, there will be 4d6 giant dire wolves; in a sky castle, there will be 4d6 giant raptors.

###### Spoils

A slain lesser titan can be harvested with Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the following component useful in magic research:

* pituitary gland (20 st, 1200gp, *battering ram, flying fortress, magic carpet, sling stone, sudden stair, wall of smoke,* armor +1, weapon +3)

Lesser titan mages have more valuable pituitary glands (35 st, 2100gp).
