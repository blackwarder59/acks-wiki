### Octopus, Giant

The giant octopus is an aggressive and territorial ambush predator that lives in the warm southern waters of the Ammas Aurë as well as along the coast of western and eastern Ulruk. A giant octopus can measure up to 6’ long with 12’ tentacles and weigh up to 600 lbs. Giant octopodes are quite clever, indeed semi-sapient, but disinterested in training. They are rarely tamed and trained, though occasionally undersea races such as tritons might do so.

###### Combat

Giant octopodes have **acute olfaction** granting them a +1 bonus to avoid surprise in their native habitat. Their fluid-filled statocysts grant them **aquatic mechanoreception** that enables them to “see” underwater to a range of 270’ (p. XX).

A giant octopus can change the color of its skin to blend with rocks, coral, or seaweed; flatten itself against surfaces or contort itself to resemble plants or rocks; and even adjust the texture of its skin. Such traits make it a **superb hider** (equivalent to a 14th level thief).

It can attack creatures within 5’ with its beak and within 10’ with its tentacles. A successful hit with a tentacle deals 1d3 bludgeoning damage and **restrains** the creature (p. XX). While a creature is restrained by a tentacle, the octopus can automatically deal 1d2 {B!} damage on its initiative each round to the restrained creature without having to make an attack throw. Doing so counts as the octopus’s attack with that tentacle. A restrained creature can escape by breaking free, slipping free, or cutting off the tentacle. To cut off a tentacle, an attack must deal 6 {S} damage or more to it in one blow. Any damage dealt beyond the required amount is not dealt to the octopus (the tentacle was severed).

Once per day, a giant octopus can use its combat action to create a 30' radius **cloud of black ink** around itself. The ink has the effect of a *tenebrosity* spell but it disperses into the water after 1 turn. On its first initiative after creating ink, an octopus can use a **jet of water** to propel itself at triple its swimming speed.

###### Ecology

Giant octopi reproduce only once in their lifetime and intensively care for their offspring. The female deposits a gelatinous egg mass on to a hard surface, and then stays with the mass until the eggs hatch. Anytime a nest of giant octopi is encountered, the octopi will be guarding one egg mass. Giant octopi egg masses have 1 hp and weigh 1 st.

###### Spoils

A slain giant octopus can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping providing for the following components useful in magic research:

* radial muscles (4 2/6 st, 260gp, *swift sword*)
* ink sac (5 st, 300gp, *shrouding fog, tenebrosity*)
* tentacles (4 2/6 st, 260gp, *choking grip, sunder structure*)

If not used for magic research, a giant octopus’s ink sac fetches 60gp and weighs 4/6 st.
