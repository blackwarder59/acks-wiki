### Varmint, Giant Ferret

These nasty-tempered creatures are much like their smaller kin but grow to a length of 4’ and weight of 135lbs.

###### Combat

Giant ferrets have **acute hearing** and **acute olfaction.** They gain a +2 bonus to avoid surprise in their natural habitat. They can track the scent of creatures for up to 2 miles with the equivalent of one rank of Tracking proficiency. They are **skilled climbers**, able to ascend sheer surfaces as if they were thieves (5+).

###### Ecology

When giant ferrets are encountered in their den, the ferrets will be rearing 4d4 juvenile ferrets and 2d4 baby ferrets. Juveniles have AC 2, Spd 120’, HD ½, and 1 bite (1d3 {P}). Babies have AC 1, Spd 120’, 1 hp, ML -4, and do not fight.

###### Spoils

A giant ferret corpse can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following component useful in magic research:

* snout (1/6 st, 15gp, *locate animal or plant*)

A giant ferret's pelt fetches 7gp and weighs 2/6 st.

Giant ferrets are sometimes used to hunt other giant vermin, but their temperamental personalities make them difficult to train.

###### Encounter

A field here is pocketed with holes 3' in diameter. Scattered near the holes are the bones and gristle of dogs and other small animals. Below the field lies a burrow, consisting of four 12’ square dens crisscrossed by horizontal tunnels, each 2’ to 5’ in diameter. The burrow is occupied by **11 giant ferrets**. The ferrets are rearing **9 juvenile ferrets** and **4 baby ferrets**.
