### Owlbeast

Owlbeasts are chaotic crossbreeds with the heads and shoulders of giant horned owls and the torsos and limbs of brown bears. Their coats range in color from brown-black to yellowish brown, with feathers in dun or light grey, while their beaks are a dull ivory color. Their red-rimmed eyes betray a bestial madness born of their unnatural biology. A full-grown owlbeast can stand as tall as 8' and weigh up to 1,500lb.

###### Combat

Mean-spirited and man-eating, owlbeasts are highly aggressive. Characters encountering owlbeasts suffer a -2 penalty to reaction rolls.

Owlbeasts have the **acute vision** of a bird of prey and gain a +1 bonus to avoid surprise in their native habitat. Like grizzly bears, owlbeasts are **skilled climbers**, able to ascend sheer surfaces as if they were thieves (6+).

If an owlbeast successfully attacks the same target with both claws in the same attack routine, it immediately **hugs** the target for an additional 2d8 {B!} damage. If the hug kills the target, the owlbeast can cleave with its claw.

###### Ecology

Owlbeasts dwell in wooded areas, and often make their dens in caves or dungeons. When owlbeasts are encountered in a wilderness den, there is a 66% chance the adults will be rearing owlbeast cubs. Roll 1d4 for age and number: 1-2 it’s 1d3 babies, 3-4 it’s 1d3-1 juveniles. Juvenile owlbeasts have AC 2, Spd 90’, HD 2+2, and attack with two claws (1d3 {S}) and bite (1d3 {P}). Baby owlbeasts have AC 1, Spd 90’, HD 1+2, and attack with 2 scratches (1 {S}) and 1 nibble (1 {P}).

###### Spoils

A slain owlbeast can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the following components useful in magic research:

* claws (3 st, 175gp, *iron maiden,* weapon +1)
* stomach (3 st, 175gp, *slumber,* armor +1)

Though it cannot fly, an owlbeast has 3d10 flight feathers. Each feather fetches 1d6gp and weighs 1 st per 25 feathers. An owlbeast’s hide fetches 100gp and weighs 2 st.

A live owlbeast is also valuable. Despite their aggressive nature, owlbeasts captured young can be readily trained as guard animals by trainers with an appropriately cruel and stern disposition.

###### Encounter

A 100’ tall cedar tree, with great spreading branches, looms taller than the other trees in this grove. A hollow in the base of the great tree is the den of a mated **pair of owlbeasts**.

**Owlbeasts (2):** Spd 120’, AC 4, HD 5, hp 34, 21, #AT 3 (2 claws/bite 6+), Dmg 1d8 {S!} /1d8 {S!} / 1d8 {P!}, Save F3, ML +1, AL C, XP 200; Special: hug (2d8 {B!} if both claws strike in one round)

A bloodstained but otherwise unmarred round Imperial cavalryman’s *shield +1* lies atop some bones in the hollow.
