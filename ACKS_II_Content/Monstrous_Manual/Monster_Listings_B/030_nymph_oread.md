### Nymph, Oread

The nymphs of the mountains, oreads roam the forests of their rocky homes, hunting such wild beasts as take their fancy, exulting in the chase. When not hunting, oreads dwell in cavernous lairs in the high peaks, often accessible only by magic.

Like all nymphs, they resemble stunning, elf-like women, though their skin is like finely polished stone and their eyes the colors of brilliant gemstones.

Oreads are found in the Achaean, Drakonir, and Meniri Mountains of southern Aurëpos. They are very rarely found in the Jutting Mountains, as faeries rather than nymphs dominate that region.

Like other nymphs, most oreads speak Classical Nicean as well as the local dialect of their region. They do not have their own language.

###### Combat

Oreads are **keen hunters** with two ranks of Survival and Tracking proficiency. They gain a +1 damage bonus when using weapons. They wear leather armor and carry spears and shortbows, with which they are **precise shots**. They deal extraordinary damage with these weapons.

In order to access their cavern lairs, oreads can cast **passageway**as a spell-like ability at will. However, they can only pass through unworked earth, rock, or stone.

Oreads can use **bewitch humanoid**at will as a spell-like ability. The effect is identical to that of the spell except that it has a duration of 12 months. Oreads are not as inclined to use this ability as other nymphs. However, should an oread encounter an elven or human character who is a skilled hunter (Judge’s discretion), she will attempt to bewitch him into being her mate. Like naiads, oreads generally release their victims after mating.

###### Ecology

Unlike other nymphs, oreads are not bound to a specific locale. Thus they can be encountered as wandering monsters far from their lair. Those lucky enough to find their lairs find they often contain metals, minerals, and fine furs kept as hunting trophies.

Oreads enjoy ageless longevity, and typically give birth to just one child in their life, always in union with a betwitched mate. There is a 7% chance for each oread encountered in a lair to be rearing a young naiad. Roll 1d4 to determine her age: 1, she’s a baby oread; 2-4, she’s a juvenile oread. Juvenile oreads have AC 0, Spd 90’, 1 HD, and attack with a dagger or other tiny weapon (1d4 {W}). Baby oreads have AC 0, Spd 90’, 1 hp, ML -4, and do not fight. Neither juveniles nor babies have spell-like abilities.

###### Spoils

An oread corpse can be harvested with Healing 1 for the following components useful in magic research:
