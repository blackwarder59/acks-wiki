### Spider, Giant Tarantula

Nasga, goddess of beauty and pain, bred the first giant spiders to help weave her web of suffering across the world. They are found in desolate ruins, dungeons, and forsaken wilderness throughout Aurëpos, Danae, and Ulruk.

The tarantula is the largest of the giant arachnids, measuring 8' long and weighing 500 lbs. It has oily barbed hair all over its carapace that gives it a disturbingly fuzzy appearance. Like their ordinary cousins, giant tarantulas live in trees or silk-lined tunnels and excel at ambush.

###### Combat

Giant tarantulas are **naturally** stealthy in their natural habitat, and creatures encountering them suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls.

A giant tarantula can attack targets up to 30’ away by flinging the barbed hairs on its abdomen for 1d4 {P} damage. A creature damaged by a tarantula’s barb becomes **irritated** by a burning itch for 1 day or until healed by *cure light injury*. While irritated, the creature suffers a -2 penalty on attack and proficiency throws.

The bite of the giant tarantula is **highly toxic**. A creature damaged by a tarantula’s bite must make a Death saving throw. If the save fails, the creature dies of poison after 1 turn.

###### Ecology

When a wilderness den of giant tarantulas is encountered, there is a 5% chance per tarantula that it will have constructed an egg sac containing 1d2 eggs. The eggs have 1 hp and weigh 5/6 st. Spiderlings disperse after birth and are not found in the den.

###### Spoils

A giant tarantula corpse can be harvested with Animal Husbandry 2 for the following components useful in magic research:

* barded bristles (2 stone, 120gp, *mage missile, poison*)
* leg tarsus (4/6 st, 40gp, *spider climb*)
* spinneret (3/6 st, 30gp, *webbing*)

If not used for magic research, a giant tarantula’s mandibles fetch 8gp and weigh 1/6 st. Its venom (onset time 1d4 turns, +2 saving throw modifier, 3d10 {Po} damage on failed Death saving throw) fetches 375gp and weighs 1/6 st.

Like all arachnids, giant tarantula are cunning enough to learn but so hostile as to be almost untrainable – albeit somewhat easier than black widows and crab spiders.
