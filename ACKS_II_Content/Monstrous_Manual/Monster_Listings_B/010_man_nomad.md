### Man, Nomad

Nomads are pastoralists who make seasonal migrations in search of pasture. They are found primarily are regions west of the Auran Empire, including Opelenea, Kemesh, Shebatea, and Skysostan. Nomads dwell in temporary camps of tents or other portable structures and travel with large herds of livestock. Nomads often trade with humans and demi-humans they encounter, but will almost always clash with beastmen.

###### Combat

33% of nomad warriors will be veterans with 1 HD equipped with composite bow, lance, scimitar, chain mail, and steppe warhorses or war camels. 66% of nomad warriors will be regulars with 1-1 HD, equipped with composite bows, swords, leather armor, and steppe riding horses or riding camels.

The veterans have **animal reflexes** that grant a +1 bonus to initiative and **precise shooting skills** (as the proficiency). They are **skilled warriors** who gain a +1 damage bonus.

###### Ecology

Each caravan of nomads will be led by a 5th level barbarian accompanied by five 2nd level barbarians. A nomad camp will be ruled by a 7th level barbarian chief. As long as the nomad chief is alive, the nomad will gain a +2 bonus to morale rolls.

Nomad camps will have adult noncombatants (adolescent, disabled, elderly, nursing, or pregnant) and juveniles equal to 100% and 300% of the number of warriors respectively. These have Spd 90’, AC 0, 1 hp, ML -4, and do not fight.

When nomads are encountered in a camp, certain additional creatures will be present. There will be steppe horses or camels, cows, and sheep equal to 100%, 400%, and 2000% of the number of nomad warriors The camp will be protected by 4d6 trained hunting dogs. In addition, there will be a 6th level barbarian serving as sub-chief and a 6th level shaman advising the chief.

The nomad leaders will be equipped with composite bow, lance, sword, shield, lamellar armor, and steppe warhorses or war camels.

###### Spoils

A slain nomad can be harvested for the following component useful in magic research:

* heart (1/6 st, 5gp or 10gp, *beguile humanoid*)

Nomads do not have magic items by treasure type. Instead, nomad leaders should be assigned magic items using the ***ACKS II JJ***rules (p. XX), whether they are in lair or not.

###### Notes

This nomad camp in this monster listing is equivalent to 175 nomad families. The number of veterans and leaders is based on the demographic and economic assumptions of nomad families explained in ***Axioms Issue 22: What is Best in Life?***and summarized in ***ACKS II JJ***(p. XX).
