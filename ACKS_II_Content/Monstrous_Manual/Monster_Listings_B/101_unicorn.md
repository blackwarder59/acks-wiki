### Unicorn

Unicorns were created by the Empyrean gods as icons of honor, nobility, and purity. A unicorn resembles a wild horse of medium size, with a long straight ivory horn projecting from its brow. Most unicorns have snow white coats, but some are palomino, blood bay, or even black. Their manes and tails can be white, gold, red, or black. Their bright, intelligent eyes are deep sea-blue, violet, brown, or fiery gold. Unicorn stallions often sport a short beard the same color as their mane.

They are sapient and can speak their own language as well as the beast-tongue of horses. There is a 25% chance a unicorn speaks Common and 50% chance it speaks Elvish.

###### Combat

A unicorn’s horn is magical and deals extraordinary damage. In addition, a unicorn can cast **cure light injury** thrice per day as a spell-like ability by touching a creature with its horn.

A unicorn can cast **arcane shift** once per day as a spell-like ability, thereby transporting itself and its rider (if any) up to 360' in any direction.

###### Ecology

Though unicorns once galloped across all the lands of Aurëpos, they have been hunted to the brink of extinction by poachers greedy for their magical horns. They are now found only in primordial forests of Northern and Southern Argollë and in the forest peaks of the great mountain ranges.

When a unicorn herd is encountered, there is a 50% chance they will be a matriarchal herd with 1d4-1 juvenile unicorns and 1d3-1 baby unicorns. (Otherwise, it’s a bachelor herd.) Juvenile unicorns have AC 5, Spd 180’, HD 2, and attack with 2 hooves (1d3 {B{). Baby unicorns have AC -1, Spd 180’, HD 1, and attack with 1 hoof (1 {B}). Neither have horns or the special abilities that the horns afford their parents.

###### Spoils

A slain unicorn can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the following components useful in magic research:

* horn (16 4/6 st, 1,000gp, *discern evil, cure injury, healing circle, purify food and water, spirit of healing*)
* hooves (5 5/6 st, 350gp, *arcane shift, safe travels*)

If not used for magic research, a unicorn's horn fetches 4d4x100gp. It weighs 1 stone for every 1,000gp value.

Unicorns can be trained only be monster whispering. They will only consent to be trained or ridden by Lawful elven women or human women with CHA 16+ or Elven Bloodline.
