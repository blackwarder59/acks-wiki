### Man, Naval Mariner

The struggle between the great realms of Aurëpos is fought as often at sea as on land. Naval mariners can be encountered engaging in coastal patrols, exploratory journeys, fleet maneuvers, raids, scouting expeditions, or transport missions.

###### Combat

Adventurers in 1.5 or 2.5-rower galleys or longships suffer a -2 penalty to reaction rolls with naval mariners, who assume them to be pirates or raiders. Adventurers in war galleys flagged as belonging to one the mariners’ enemy realms suffer a -4 penalty.

Hostile reactions with naval mariners triggers an immediate attack while unfriendly reactions triggers an attempt to board to inspect for criminals, contraband, or untaxed goods.

###### Ecology

When naval mariners are encountered, use the Lair roll to determine whether the mariners are crewing a solitary galley or a fleet of galleys. If a single vessel is encountered, roll 1d20 to determine the type of galley. If a fleet of vessels is encountered, roll 1d6! for the its size, and then roll 1d20 to determine the type of each galley in the fleet.

The number of sailors, rowers, and marines, as well as the captain’s level, is determined by the type of vessel, the number of vessels, and the crew requirements for the vessels.

| Roll | Galley | Sailors | Rowers | Marines | Level |
| 1 | 1-rower | 3 | 30 | - | 3rd |
| 2-3 | 2-rower | 5 | 90 | 10 | 4th |
| 4-6 | 2.5-rower | 10 | 120 | 10 | 5th |
| 7-10 | 3-rower | 15 | 170 | 15 | 6th |
| 11-14 | 4-rower | 15 | 180 | 75 | 6th |
| 15-17 | 5-rower | 20 | 300 | 75 | 6th |
| 18-19 | 6-rower | 20 | 336 | 100 | 6th |
| 20 | 8-rower | 50 | 440 | 150 | 7th |

50% of **marines** will be archers equipped with short sword, short bow, and leather armor and 50% will be heavy infantry equipped with short sword, shield, and laminated linen armor. All marines will be equipped with grappling hooks and 50’ ropes. They will have one boarding ramp per 8 marines (rounded up). Marines are **skilled warriors** who gain a +1 damage bonus. Rowers and sailors will be equipped with short swords, daggers, and leather armor.

As parts of its crew, each vessel will have a sailing master (0th level specialist with two ranks of Seafaring) and a navigator (0th level specialist with one rank of Seafaring and one rank of Navigation).

Each vessel will carry one naval captain of between 3rd and 7th level depending on type. Naval fleets will be led by a merchant commodore commanding the fleet from its largest vessel. The commodore will be one level higher than the vessel’s captain. Naval captains and commodores are usually fighters. Captains will have two ranks of Seafaring, while commodores will be master mariners with three ranks of Seafaring.
