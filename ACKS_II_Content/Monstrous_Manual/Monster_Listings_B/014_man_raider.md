### Man, Raider

Unlike berserkers, who devote their full time to fighting, raiders are seasonal warriors. In between reaping and sowing crops, the young men of Jutland and other barbaric regions are wont to raid foreign shores in search of booty. Because of their heroic culture of battle, these part-time farmers are often as or even more skilled than the soldiers they confront in raids.

###### Combat

33% of raiders will be veterans equipped with spear, sword, shield, and chainmail armor. 33% of raiders will be regulars equipped with spear, battle axe, shield and leather armor. The final 33% will be regulars equipped with short bow, hand axe, and leather armor.

Veterans have **animal reflexes** and gain a +1 bonus to initiative. As raiders and looters, they are **naturally stealthy**, so characters encountering them suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls. As **skilled warriors** they gain a +1 damage bonus.

###### Ecology

Each raider gang will be led by a 2nd level barbarian. Each raider warband will be led by a 3rd level barbarian. A raider camp will be run by a 6th level barbarian.

If raiders are encountered on water, they will be the crew and passengers of longships. There will be one longship per 60 raiders, rounded down to a minimum of 1 longship.

###### Spoils

A slain raider can be harvested with Healing 1 for the following component useful in magic research:

* heart (1/6 st, 5gp or 10gp, *beguile humanoid*)

Raiders will not have magic items by treasure type. Instead, raider leaders should be assigned magic items using the ***ACKS II JJ***rules (p. XX), whether they are in lair or not.

When raiders are encountered in camp, they will always have treasure. When raiders are encountered at sea, roll 1d10. On 1-5, the raiders are heading out to raid and have no treasure. On 6-10, the raiders are returning home with treasure. Raiders returning home with treasure will attempt to evade encounters if possible.

###### Notes

This monster listing is just an example. It should not be construed to mean raiders cannot have other proficiencies or troop types. The Judge can and should stock his wilderness with raiders that are trained and equipped in sensible ways for his campaign! The number of veterans and leaders is based on the demographics of heroism for barbarians, summarized in ***ACKS II JJ***(p. XX).

In ***Domains at War*** terms, raiders are classified as elite veteran heavy infantry C, regular light infantry B, or regular bowmen.
