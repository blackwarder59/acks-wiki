### Mass, Gelatinous

A gelatinous mass resembles a block of transparent aspic jelly with inorganic material remains trapped and visible inside it. A typical gelatinous mass is 125 cubic feet and weighs 2,150lb; it can adjust its size to squeeze through crevasses or expand to fill corridors. The masses are utterly mindless and perpetually hungry, existing only to consume.

###### Combat

Gelatinous masses have **translucent bodies** that make them hard to spot. Creatures encountering them suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls. Their jelly-like forms are highly sensitive to vibrations, enabling the gelatinous masses to “see” by **terrestrial mechanoreception** over long distances equivalent to line of sight in full daylight. However, creatures that are flying, levitating, or otherwise not touching the ground are invisible to the sense.

When a gelatinous mass attacks, it attempts to engulf a creature in front of it (“front” being whichever direction it moved or desired to move). The gelatinous mass can ignore the target’s AC from armor, but not AC from DEX, magic items, natural armor, or spells. (Any creatures foolish or unlucky enough to move into the mass are automatically hit.)

If the gelatinous mass’s attack succeeds, the creature struck must make a Paralysis saving throw. If the save fails, the creature takes 2d4 {A!} damage and is **ingurgitated** into the mass. If the saving throw succeeds, the creature takes 2d4 {A!} damage but is not ingurgitated. The gelatinous mass can cleave after a successful attack that ingurgitates a creature, possibly ingurgitating another creature! However, the gelatinous mass cannot ingurgitate more than 10 small, 5 man-sized, or 2 large creatures at the same time. If new creatures are ingurgitated, one or more of the currently ingurgitated creatures are ejected from the mass to its “rear”.

While ingurgitated, a creature is **paralyzed** by the thick gelatin. It suffers 2d4 {A!} damage at the start of its initiative each round until either the gelatinous mass is destroyed or the creature dies. Should the ingurgitated creature die and remain in the mass for 6 turns, it is irrecoverably dissolved, along with any fabric or leather items it was carrying or wearing. (The mass’s acid cannot dissolve metal.)

Gelatinous masses are immune to enchantment effects and to acidic, cold, electrical, luminous, necrotic, and poisonous damage.

###### Ecology

Gelatinous masses ceaselessly creep along dungeon corridors and cave floors, absorbing carrion, creatures, and trash. They reproduce by budding, creating a gelatinous mess (baby) after consuming 2,150 lbs of organic matter.

Any encounter with a gelatinous cube can yield treasure, even though the creature has no lair. The treasure (if any) is always floating in its body, along with bits of bone, stone, and metal.
