### Zombie

Zombies are undead corpses reanimated through dark and sinister magic such as *animate undead* or *undead legion* or through the supernatural workings of **sinkholes of evil**.

Most zombies are created from the corpses of humans, but other corpses can be used. A zombie created from a non-human corpse has a number of HD equal to what the creature possessed in life (excluding class levels) plus one additional HD.

Despite their semblance of life, zombies are effectively walking corpses with only the modicum of sapience. Because of their stupidity, any instructions given to a zombie by its creator or controller must be very simple. In the absence of orders or opponents, zombies simply stumble around aimlessly.

Some zombies are clad in nothing more than the rotting remnants of the clothing they wore in life, but others are armored and armed by their evil masters. A zombie wearing armor adds the AC bonus to its own natural AC of 1.

###### Combat

Unless under another’s control, zombies are automatically Hostile to any living creature they encounter. However, they are **clumsy** and suffer a -2 penalty to initiative rolls.

Zombies can attack with melee weapons (if available) or with natural attacks. Zombies that had natural attacks when living retain their natural attacks as undead. Zombies that had no natural attacks gain a bite attack dealing 1d8 {P} damage (or an average of 2 piercing damage per HD). Zombies with more than 4+1 HD deal extraordinary damage.

Zombies are **immune** to enchantment effects and poisonous damage. They are inherently evil for purposes of *discern evil*and *holy circle*spells. Regardless of their HD, all zombies can be rebuked easily (e.g. as zombies) by casters capable of doing so.

###### Ecology

Zombies that spawn in sinkholes of evil will usually be found lingering in the vicinity of their “birthplace,” though from time to time the pursuit of living creatures that come upon them may draw the zombie away from the sinkhole. Zombies that were created by chaotic spellcasters are frequently used to guard locations or valuable treasure in dungeons.

###### Spoils

A destroyed zombie can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the following components useful in magic research:

* brain (2/6 st, 20gp, *deathless minion, rouse the fallen, undead legion*)
* heart (1/6 st, 10gp, *wall of corpses*)
