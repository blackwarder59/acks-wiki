### Wraith

Wraiths are undead creatures created by necromantically binding a disembodied soul to a set of apparel or armor, thereby granting it a physicality it would otherwise lack. From a distance, wraiths can be mistaken for pilgrims or other travelers clad in heavy cloaks, mantles, boots, and gloves. But close up, the horrifying truth becomes clear: There is nothing – no body, no bones, no flesh – within the clothing, just a shadowy void punctuated at eye level by pinpricks of flame.

###### Combat

Because of the magic that binds them to their garb, wraiths are semi-corporeal creatures that can speak, use equipment, ride mounts, and otherwise act in the world. If clad in mundane apparel or armor (of any type), a wraith has an AC of 6, but if clad in magical apparel or armor, it has an AC of 6 plus the magic bonus. It can further buttress its AC by using a shield.

If unarmed, a wraith attacks with an **enervating touch** that deals 1d8 {N!} damage. If armed, it deals damage by weapon +2, and the weapon cause {N!} damage in addition to its normal damage type. When a wraith damages a living creature, it permanently reduces the target’s maximum hp by an amount equal to the damage dealt. If the creature’s hp are reduced to 0, the creature is slain. If not slain, the creature becomes **enervated**.

An enervated creature must make a Death saving throw each day when it wakes from resting. If the save fails, the creature permanently reduces its maximum hp by another point. If the save succeeds, the creature does not reduce its maximum hp further that day. If a creature’s hp are reduced to 0 by the enervating touch, the creature is slain. if the save succeeds three times in a row, the condition ends. If a creature is slain by the enervating touch or enervated condition, it cannot be restored to life save by ritual magic*.* One day after the creature dies, it manifests as a **haunt** somewhere within 300’ of where it died (see p. XX).

If a wraith is reduced to 0 hp, the magic that grants it semi-corporeality is undone. All of its apparel and equipment drop to the ground, and the wraith’s spirit departs forever.

Wraiths are **immune** to enchantment effects, necrotic damage, poisonous damage, and all mundane damage except fire. However, silver weapons deal extraordinary damage against wraiths. Wraiths are inherently evil for purposes of *discern evil*and *holy circle*spells and are, of course, rebuked as wraiths.

###### Ecology

Wraiths are usually created as servants of some dark lord or necromancer-king and are thus often encountered on quests for their foul master. They can also be found in chaotic temples, places of death, and other sinkholes of evil.

A wraith sustains itself on the life-energy released when a living creature becomes a haunt. If it does not create at least one haunt per month, it loses 1 HD. It can replenish lost HD by creating additional haunts. If ever reduced to 1 HD, the wraith permanently becomes a haunt itself. A wraith that resides in a sinkhole of evil can sustain itself from the ambient energies of the sinkhole and does not have to feed.
