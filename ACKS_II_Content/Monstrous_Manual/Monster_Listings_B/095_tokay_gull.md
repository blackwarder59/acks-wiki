### Tokay Gull

The famous transmogrifier Niv of Nicea (14 – 98 IY) created the first tokay gulls by crossbreeding tokay geckos with seagulls. The resultant creature resembles a 2’ long tokay gecko with a pair of seagull wings that span 5’. A full grown tokay gull weighs around 9 lbs. Despite its small size, the tokay gull is aggressive, territorial, noisy, and covetous of both food and shiny objects.

Niv’s aim was to fashion the ideal familiar, messenger, and guard animal, and to his credit, his tokay gulls served him in just that capacity throughout his long life. Unfortunately, after the mage’s passing, his stock of tokay gulls broke out of his menagerie into the wild and began reproducing rapidly. Today, tokay gulls are found throughout Aurëpos, where they are widely considered nuisances and pests.

Kobolds, however, have come to love tokay gulls, and actively breed them as guard animals trained to bark when intruders are nearby. The loud shriek of the gulls can be heard from a great distance, especially in quiet caves and dungeons prone to echoes, and the bites of a gaggle of tokay gulls can be enough to kill a man.

Tokay gulls count as animals for purposes of serving as familiars.

###### Combat

Tokay gulls, like their lacertine progenitors, are **natural climbers**. They can climb utterly unimpeded across vertical surfaces or move upside down across ceilings at their combat movement rate. They can attack with their bites and defend themselves normally, but cannot charge or run while climbing. (Note that this is not just Climbing proficiency.)

Immediately upon detecting unfamiliar creatures, tokay gulls begin to **bark**. Once a tokay gull starts barking, it continues to do so each round that it detects unfamiliar creatures and for another 1d3 rounds thereafter, or until it is killed.

A single tokay gull’s bark can be heard to a range of 320’ in ordinary environments (double the range in quiet environments, halve it in loud environments); for each additional tokay gull, the range of earshot is increased by 30’. If there are any stocked monsters within earshot, they will respond to the alarm at the Judge’s discretion.

In addition, if there are wandering monsters in the dungeon, the Judge will make an encounter throw every round that the tokay gulls scream. If the throw results in an encounter, the wandering monsters attracted by the gulls will arrive in 2d6 rounds.

###### Ecology

When a wilderness colony of tokay gulls is encountered, there is a 25% chance per gull that it will have hidden a clutch of 1d2 eggs under rocks, in crevices, or in tree hollows nearby. The eggs have 1 hp and weight 1/6 st. Tokay gull hatchlings are rarely found in nests, because the creatures immediately disperse into the wild after they emerge from their eggs.
