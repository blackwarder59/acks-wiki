### Shadow

At first glimpse, shadows appear as just the ordinary silhouettes cast by a human body occluding a light source. A closer look reveals that there is no body to cast a shadow – and that the silhouette moves with its own malevolent purpose.

Often mistaken for undead, shadows are actually incorporeal entities from the Outer Darkness. Some sages believe they are bodiless cacodemons; others argue they are dead spirits that have been damned to the black void and returned. All agree that shadows hunger for the life-energy of living creatures.

###### Combat

Shadows **move with utter silence** and cannot be detected by echolocation or listening. They are **difficult to spot** except in bright daylight, and characters encountering them suffer a -3 penalty to surprise rolls.

When a shadow successfully attacks a living creature, its **enervating touch** deals 1d4 {N!} damage to the creature, then permanently reduces the target’s maximum hp by an amount equal to the damage dealt. If the creature’s hp are reduced to 0, the creature is slain.

If not slain, the creature becomes **enervated**.An enervated creature must make a Death saving throw each day when it wakes from resting. If the save fails, the creature permanently reduces its maximum hp by another point. If the save succeeds, the creature does not reduce its maximum hp further that day. If a creature’s hp are reduced to 0 by the enervating touch, the creature is slain. If the save succeeds three times in a row, the condition ends. Otherwise, a creature can only end the condition and restore its maximum hp via ritual magic.

If a creature is slain by the enervating touch or enervated condition, it cannot be restored to life save by ritual magic*.* Its soul lingers by its corpse for a day before being exiled to the Outer Darkness, where it might eventually turn into a shadow itself– a horrible and irrevocable fate!

Shadows are **immune** to enchantment effects, poisonous damage, and all mundane damage. As **incorporeal** beings, natural and non-magical weapons always deal mundane damage against them, even if the creature would otherwise deal extraordinary damage. However, silver weapons deal extraordinary damage against them. They can be detected with *discern evil*, held at bay by *holy circle*, destroyed with *dispel evil* and, if summoned, *dispelled.* In addition, they cannot enter an area lit by direct daylight or magical *illumination*.

###### Ecology

Shadows are unholy creatures with no natural habitat. They enter our world when summoned or by passing through sinkholes of evil found in temples of chaos and places of death.

###### Spoils

Destroyed shadows can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the following component useful in magic research:
