### Wasp, Giant Parasitic

Sages theorize that giant parasitic wasps first arose when ordinary parasitic wasps accidentally injected demon-blooded attercop spiderlings with their eggs. Like their smaller cousins, the wasps lay eggs in the living bodies of hosts. The host’s bodies then incubate the eggs until they hatch into a larvae, which devour the hosts from within. Ordinary parasitic wasps use aphids, beetles, spiders, and other insects as hosts, but the monstrous giant breeds need creatures much larger… like men.

###### Combat

Giant parasitic wasps have **acute olfaction** and gain a +1 bonus to avoid surprise in their native habitat. Their aerial mechanoreception enables them to “see” to a range of 60’.

A giant parasitic wasp’s stinger deals 2d4 {P!} damage and injects a **paralytic venom**. Any living creature damaged by the stinger must make a successful Death saving throw or immediately become **paralyzed** indefinitely. Every 24 hours, the victim may attempt the Death save again to end the effect; otherwise, only the application of a healing potion or magical healing will put an end to the paralysis.

A wasp that has paralyzed or slain a creature does not cleave; instead it automatically **grabs** the creature. On its next initiative, the wasp can carry off the grabbed creature with its movement action and then inject it with an egg as its combat action. If the creature is alive but paralyzed, it can make a Death save to avoid being implanted with the egg. If the save succeeds, the egg doesn’t take. If the save fails, or the creature is dead, the egg is inserted deep into the host’s body. 2d4 days after eggs are injected, the egg will hatch into a larva. The larva will start chewing its way through the host’s vital organs, dealing 1d6 extraordinary necrotic damage per round. A *cure disease* spell can destroy the egg and/or the larva but otherwise, death is certain. When the host finally dies, the larva will emerge and form a cocoon. Most of the time, the larvae withers and dies in the cocoon, but about 1 in 300 will hatch into an adult giant parasitic wasp after 2d6+14 days.

Unless encountered in its nest, a wasp will not carry off paralyzed or dead victims until all opponents are defeated or it fails a morale roll and withdraws. Otherwise, it will release the victim after injecting him and then attempt to paralyze and parasitize more hosts.

###### Ecology

Giant parasitic wasps dwell in small nests made of chewed wood pulp and saliva. They lack the complex social structure of the eusocial giant ants and giant bees.

###### Spoils

A slain giant parasitic wasp can be harvested with Animal Husbandry 2 for the following components useful in magic research:

* stinger(5 st, 300gp, *halt humanoid, halt monster*)
* ovipositor (6 st, 360gp, *disfigure body and soul, fillet and serve*
