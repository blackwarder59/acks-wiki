### Snake, Spitting Cobra

Spitting cobras are 3’ to 4’ long venomous serpents that are widely feared for their ability to spit venom at range. They are native to Shebatea, Kemesh, Opelenea, and Somirea. Like the viper, the cobra is revered as a symbol of the Chthonic gods in the Sunset Kingdoms and despised for the same reason in the east.

###### Combat

Spitting cobras have **acute olfaction** that grants them a +1 bonus to avoid surprise in their native habitat. They lack the heat-sensing organs of other snakes, however.

A spitting cobra can attack by biting its target or spitting at it. The cobra’s bite is **highly venomous**. Any creature damaged by the bite must make a successful Death saving throw or die at the end of the cobra’s initiative.

The cobra’s spit can be projected to a range of 10’. The spit deals no damage, but the creature struck must make a Death saving throw. If the save fails, the creature is permanently **blinded**. A *cure blindness* spell can reverse the effect.

###### Ecology

Spitting cobras sometimes congregate in dens during brumation or breeding season. When a den of spitting cobras is encountered, there is a 10% chance per cobra that it will be incubating a clutch of 2d20 eggs. The eggs have 1 hp and weight 1/1000 st (1 coin). Cobra snakelets are rarely found in nests, because the snakelets immediately disperse into the wild after they emerge from their eggs.

###### Spoils

A spitting cobra corpse can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following components useful in magic research:

* fangs (2/6 st, 7gp, *cause blindness, poison*)
* tongue (1/6 st, 6gp, *snakes to staffs, staffs to snakes*)

If not used for magic research, a spitting cobra’s fangs fetch 3gp and weigh 1/6 st. Its venom (onset time 1 turn, no saving throw modifier, 1d6 {Po} damage on failed Death saving throw) fetches 100gp if properly extracted.

###### Lair

A small cave mouth, obscured by tangled vines and thick underbrush, opens into a limestone cavern littered with shed snake skins, small bones, and scattered leaves. This is the den of **four spitting cobras.** The smallest cobra is a female that is incubating a clutch of **17 cobra eggs**.

**Spitting cobras (4):** Spd 90’, AC 2, HD 1\*, hp 8, 6, 4, 3, #AT 1 (bite or spit 10+), Dmg 1d3 {P} + poison or blindness, Save F1, ML -1, XP 13; Special: poison bite, poison spit
