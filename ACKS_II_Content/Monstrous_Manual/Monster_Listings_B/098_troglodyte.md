### Troglodyte

These subterranean monsters are scaly reptilian humanoids, about 6’6” tall and 150 lbs weight, with bony spines along the center of the top of their heads, backs, and backs of their arms. Mages who have dissected them claim they are magical crossbreeds of lizardmen and chameleons, perhaps created by the Thrassians. Whatever the case, troglodytes are malicious and warlike, and will attempt to slay virtually any creatures that cross their paths.

Troglodytes speak their own foul tongue, a debased form of Elvish. Leaders have a 10% chance per HD of knowing the language of another subterranean species.

###### Combat

Troglodytes have small glands distributed across their bodies that produce **stinking slimy coatings** on their scaly hides. Demi-humans and humans that start their initiative or move within 5’ of a troglodyte must make a Death saving throw with a -2 penalty. If the save fails, the victim becomes **queasy** from the horrid stenchuntil it leaves the vicinity of the troglodyte.

The troglodytes’ chameleon-like scales make them **naturally stealthy**, and creatures encountering troglodytes have a -2 penalty to surprise rolls. This penalty does not apply to creatures that have Acute Olfaction.

They are **formidable warriors** and receive a +1 damage bonus with weapons. When out hunting, troglodyte warriors all carry 3 barbed bone darts (treat as javelins). They gain a +3 bonus to attack when hurling these darts. They usually do not wear armor or carry melee weapons, preferring to bite and claw.

###### Ecology

Each troglodyte gang will be led by a champion with 5 AC, 3 HD, 16 hp, and a +2 damage bonus (+1 with its natural attacks). Each troglodyte warband will be led by a sub-chieftain with 6 AC, 4 HD, 20 hp, and a +2 damage bonus (+1 with its natural attacks). A troglodyte lair or warren will be led by a chieftain with 7 AC, 6 HD, 28 hp, and a +3 damage bonus (+2 with its natural attacks). As long as the chieftain is alive, the troglodytes will gain a +2 bonus to morale rolls. Leaders often carry stone battle axes or clubs as a sign of rank.

Troglodyte lairs and warrens will have females and eggs equal to 100% the number of males in the lair each. Female troglodytes fight as hobgoblins, but only to defend the eggs.

When troglodytes are encountered in their warren, certain additional creatures will be present. The chieftain will be accompanied by one additional sub-chieftain for every warband, and 2d4 additional champions. In addition, a warren has a 33% chance of a shaman being present, and a 25% chance of a witch doctor. A shaman is equivalent to a sub-chieftain statistically, but has Shaman abilities at level 1d4. A witch doctor is equivalent to a champion statistically, but has Mage abilities at level 1d2.
