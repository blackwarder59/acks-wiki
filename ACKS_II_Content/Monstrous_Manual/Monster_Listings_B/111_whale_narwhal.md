### Whale, Narwhal

These large whales typically reach a length of 15’ and weight of 3,500 lbs. The great horn of a narwhal resembles that of a unicorn, and is highly sought by whalers for its reputed magical properties. They tend to be found only in the less-hunted waters of the north or extreme south and are only rarely seen in the Ammas Aurë. They are highly intelligent and social creatures capable of complex communication.

###### Combat

Narwhals use **aquatic mechanoreception** to “see” in water up to 600’. Spells or effects that would ordinarily cause blindness do not affect the whale while it is using aquatic mechanoreception. However, creatures that are not in the water are invisible to them. Aquatic mechanoreception does not penetrate structures or terrain features.

While not able to breathe water, narwhals can **hold their breath** for 3 turns (30 minutes). They are not as agile as other whales and infrequently breach the water.

###### Ecology

When a pod of narwhals is encountered, there is a 33% chance the adults will be accompanied by 1d3 juveniles and 1d2 babies. Juvenile narwhals have AC 0, Spd 150’, HD 3, and attack with 1 bite (1d6 {P}). Baby narwhals have AC -1, Spd 150’, HD 2, and attack with 1 bite (1d2 {P}). They do not have horns.

###### Spoils

A slain narwhal can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following component useful in magic research:

* horn (53 2/6 st., 3,200gp, *discern curse, discern evil, discern poison, swimming*)

If not used for magic research, a narwhal's horn fetches 1d6x1,000gp and weighs 1 stone for every 1,000gp value.

###### Lore

*Upon seeing the beauty of the land, the sky, and the sea, the Seven set a challenge on themselves, whereby each vowed to create a majestic beast worthy of dwelling in the beauty of the world. Each went to their demesne and worked, and when they were done they came again together in Elysium. There Ammonar revealed the proud eagles, Istreus the wise owls, and Türas the great bulls; and Ianna revealed the fierce lions, Calefa the cunning ravens, Mityara the resplendent unicorns.*

*When it was the turn of Naurivus to show what he had made, he revealed the great whales, and waxed proud at their size and strength. But Mityara laughed when she saw his whales, and called them awkward and absurd.*

*Naurivus was wroth to be so shamed by his sister, but he did naught but wait until she grew drunk on nectar and ambrosia. Then he passed unseen to her demesne and stole the horns of all the unicorns he could find. Afterwards, he carried them to the sea and affixed them to the brows of his whales, crying “Witness the majesty of the unicorn of the sea!”*

*And so were made the great narwhals; while the unicorns who had lost their horns were humbled, and so became horses. And today the narwhal and the horse are both sacred to Naurivus, their maker; while the unicorn of Mityara is but rarely found.*

* Thalosides, *Mythos*
