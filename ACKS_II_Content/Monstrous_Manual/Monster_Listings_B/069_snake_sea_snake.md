### Snake, Sea Snake

These 6' long aquatic snakes are as aggressive as they are venomous. They have flattened tails utilized for swimming and beak-like snouts with which they catch fish. They can dive to a depth of more than 50 fathoms and remain underwater for up to 5 hours.

They are native to the waters of the Narrow Sea Ammas Aurë, and more than a few unlucky adventurers, fishermen, and pearl-divers have been slain by a mere prick from their fangs.

###### Combat

Sea snakes are **extremely aggressive** and any characters encountering them suffer a -2 penalty on reaction rolls.

Like other snakes, they possess **acute olfaction** that grants them a +1 bonus to avoid surprise in their natural habitat. They lack the heat-sensing organs of their land-bound cousins but possess **aquatic mechanoreception** that enables them to “see” in the water to a range of 60’. Spells or effects that would ordinarily cause blindness do not affect a sea snake using mechanoreception. However, creatures that are not in the water are invisible to the mechanoreception. Aquatic mechanoreception does not penetrate structures or terrain features.

Their bites do just 1 {P} damage, but any creature damaged by its bite must make a Death saving throw. If the save fails, the creature dies of poison 1d4+2 turns later.

###### Ecology

Sea snakes do not establish nests or exhibit any parental care for their offspring. Their young are born fully formed in the water, and are immediately capable of swimming and hunting on their own.

###### Spoils

A slain sea snake with exceptional attributes can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following components useful in magic research:

* fangs (3/6 st., 35gp, *poison*)
* tongue (3/6 st., 30gp, *snakes to staffs, staffs to snakes*)

If not used for magic research, a sea snake’s fangs fetch 1gp and weigh 1/6 st. Its venom (onset time 1d10 turns, +2 saving modifier, 4d4 {Po} damage on failed Death saving throw) fetches 200gp if properly extracted.

###### Lore

*When he saw that Hanno had been swept overboard, Kalbo dove into the water after him. From the bulwark, I watched as Kalbo grabbed his friend and swam back to us through the chopping waves with Hanno in tow. When the pair reached the ship, the crew hoisted them back onto the deck, where they lay down exhausted and weary. Hanno’s weariness soon left him, and he rose; but Kalbo did not rise again. By the time the ship’s chirugeon came, Kalbo’s breath had fled. All the healer could do was show us the wound – the tiny wound, naught but a nibble – that had envenomed and slain the hero.*

* Toraster the Elder, *Bestiary of Aurëpos*
