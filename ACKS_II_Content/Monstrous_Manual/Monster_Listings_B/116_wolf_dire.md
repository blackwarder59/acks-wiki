### Wolf, Dire

Dire wolves are large wolves bred from wargs and trained as war mounts by beastmen. They are 8’ long and 4’9” tall at the shoulder and weigh about 585 lbs.

###### Combat

Dire wolves have **acute hearing** and **acute olfaction.** They gain a +2 bonus to avoid surprise in their natural habitat. They can track the scent of creatures for up to 4 miles with the equivalent of two ranks of Tracking proficiency.

As pack hunters, dire wolves are more confident when they have greater numbers. If encountered in or reduced to a pack of 4 or fewer, their morale score is reduced by 1.

###### Ecology

Each pack or route of dire wolves will be led by a chief, who fights as a warg. (The chief does not have the sapience of a warg, however.)

When dire wolves are encountered in their den, the adults will be rearing 1d3 puppies. Roll 1d6 for age; 1-4, they’re juveniles, 5-6 they’re babies. Juveniles have AC 1, Spd 150’, HD 2, and attack with 1 bite (1d4 {P}). Babies have AC 0, Spd 150’, HD 1+2, and attack with 1 nibble (1 {P}).

###### Spoils

A slain dire wolf can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following component useful in magic research:

* teeth (2 2/6 st, 140gp, *call of the wolf, call of the wolf pack, skinchange*)

A dire wolf’s pelt fetches 50gp and weighs 1 4/6 st.

Because of their size and ferocity, dire wolves are rather more difficult to train than common wolves.

###### Encounter

An 8’ wide, 8’ high cleft between two great limestone boulders serves as the den of this pack of **five dire wolves** and **three baby dire wolf cubs**. One of the dire wolves is nursing the cubs, while the other four are relaxing nearby after a recent meal.

**Dire wolves (5):** Spd 180’, AC 3, HD 4+1, hp 22, 21, 20, 18, 16, #AT 1 (bite 6+), Dmg 2d4 {P}, Save F3, ML 0, AL N, XP 140

**Baby dire wolf cubs (3):** Spd 150’, AC 0, HD 1+2, hp 6, 4, 3, #AT 1 (nibble 9+), Dmg 1 {P}, Save F1, ML 0, AL N, XP 15
