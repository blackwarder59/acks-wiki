### Sphinx

Majestic creatures crossbred or created in some bygone age, sphinxes have human heads, leonine bodies, and aquiline wings. They are found throughout Aurëpos, but are most common in Kemesh, Opelenea, and Nicea. Highly territorial, they often demand tribute or food from those that enter “their” realm. Those who can’t offer tribute are killed and eaten – but not right away. Sphinxes enjoy toying with victims, tricking them, engaging them in riddling contests, and so on.

Most sphinxes are Chaotic (60%) or Neutral (30%), but a small number (10%) are Lawful. Lawful sphinxes restrict their depredations to unintelligent or Chaotic prey. For a price, Lawful sphinxes have been known to offer their services as caravan guards along wilderness trails.

Because of their long lives, sphinxes accumulate vast stores of knowledge and lore. All sphinxes speak Common as well as 1d4 ancient or archaic languages such as Ancient Zaharan.

###### Combat

In combat, sphinxes attack with their terrible claws, which deal 2d10 {S!} damage each. Once every 3 rounds, in lieu of attacking with its claws, a sphinx can deliver a **terrifying roar** with the loudness of a *fireball*. Each creature in earshot (90’ in normal environments) must make a Paralysis saving throw. If the save fails, the creature becomes **frightened.** Even if the save succeeds, the creature **falters** if it has less than 5 HD. The condition lasts for 3 rounds, unless dispelled sooner.

Sphinxes enjoy **magic resistance** to spells and spell-like effects. When a sphinx is affected by a spell or spell-like effect, it can (but does not have to) make a magic resistance throw with a +5 bonus. If the result of the throw equals or exceeds the caster level of the spell or spell-like effect, the sphinx ignores it.

Each sphinx has a 20% chance to possess the spellcasting abilities of 12th level mage. Such noble sphinxes have an XP value 4,800 and a Treasure Type of Nx2

###### Ecology

Sphinxes often make their lairs in majestic ruins with desolate grandeur. They rate but once per century, always producing twin heiracubs – one male and one female. The heiracubs remain with their parents until adolescence.

When sphinxes are encountered in a wilderness lair, there is a 10% chance the adults will be rearing 2 heiracubs. Roll 1d4 to determine age: 1, they’re babies; 2-4, they’re juveniles. Juvenile sphinxes are large size, have AC 6, Spd 120’, HD 6, and attack with two claws (1d10 {S}). Baby sphinxes have AC 5, Spd 120’, HD 4, and attack with 2 claws (1d4 {S}). They cannot fly.
