### Man, Brigand

When the drums of war beat, the lords of Aurëpos are eager to hire mercenaries and sellswords to supplement their legions. Many young and desperate men respond to these calls, leaving behind farms and families to take up arms. Some are crippled or slain by battle or disease. Most see little action and simply return to their farms when the war ends. But others find that the blood and plunder of war suits them. When the wars end, these men become brigands, outlaws, and renegades, banded together under the shared interest of stealing and pillaging.

###### Combat

As veterans of many battles, brigands have **combat reflexes** that grant a +1 bonus to initiative. They are **skilled warriors** who gain a +1 damage bonus.

66% of brigand gangs encountered will be bowmen equipped with short bow, short sword, dagger, and leather armor. 33% will be medium cavalry equipped with lance, sword, shield, lamellar armor, and scale-barded medium warhorse. (A typical bandit camp of 7 bands of 5 gangs will consist of 1 company of 120 bowmen and 1 company of 60 medium cavalry.)

###### Ecology

Each gang of brigands will be led by a 2nd level fighter. Each band of brigands will be led by a 3rd level fighter. A brigand outpost or camp will be captained by a 6th level fighter. As long as the captain is alive, the brigands will gain a +2 bonus to morale rolls.

When brigands are encountered in a camp, certain additional creatures will be present. The captain will employ 2 4th level explorers or thieves as scouts. There is a 50% chance that the brigands will be ministered to by 1d3 3rd level crusaders led by a crusader of level 1d3+2. There is a 50% chance that the brigands will be accompanied by 1d2 theurgists (2nd level mages) led by a mage of level 1d3+2.

Gang leaders will be equipped in the same manner as their gangs, while the captain and each band leader will be equipped with lance, sword, shield, plate armor, and medium warhorse with chain barding. Other leveled characters will have equipment appropriate to their class and level.

###### Spoils

A slain brigand can be harvested with Healing 1 for the following component useful in magic research:

* heart (1/6 st, 10gp, *beguile humanoid*)

Brigands do not have magic items by treasure type. Instead, brigand leaders should be assigned magic items using the ***ACKS II JJ***rules (p. XX), whether they are in lair or not.

###### Notes

This monster listing is just an example. It assumes brigands are veteran (1st level) bowmen and medium cavalry. It should not be construed to mean that brigands can never be 0th level regular troops or cannot be light infantry, heavy infantry, or other types.
