### Raptor, Small

Raptors are birds of prey renowned throughout Aurëpos for their keen vision, swift dives, and sharp talons. Eagles, falcons, hawks, owls, and vultures are all types of raptor. Small raptors include the common buzzards, goshawks, gyrfalcons, great horned owls, kestrels, marsh harriers, peregrine falcons, pharaoh vultures, saker falcons, serpent eagles, snowy owls, sparrowhawks, and similar birds. They weigh 2 to 4 lbs and measure around 9” to 1’ in length with 3’ to 5’ wingspans.

###### Combat

Raptors have **acute vision** and **alertness**, granting them a +2 bonus to avoid surprise in their natural habitat.

Their preferred attack is a **dive attack** with their talons. A dive attack inflicts double the normal damage (2/2). If the raptor hits a small creature that weighs less than itself with both its talons while making a dive attack, the creature must make a size-adjusted Paralysis saving throw. If the save fails, the creature is **grabbed**.

Certain types of small raptors have additional abilities.

* **Great Horned Owl:** These birds only have a speed of 100’/300’ instead of 160’/480’. However, they have **acute hearing** and **night vision**. They can fly silently on a Sneaking throw of 6+.

###### Ecology

When small raptors are encountered in their aerie, there is a 35% chance each small raptor is guarding eggs or juveniles. Roll 1d10 for age and number: 1 they’re 1d8 eggs, 2-10 they’re 1d juvenile small raptors. Juvenile small raptors have AC 1, Spd 30’, 1 hp, ML -4, and do not fight. Small raptor eggs have 1 hp and weigh 1/500 st.

###### Spoils

A small raptor cannot be harvested for special components or flight feathers. However, small raptors are often tamed and trained as hunting birds.

###### Lore

*The noblest of all birds is the imperial eagle, and the swiftest the peregrine falcon; but the wisest of all birds is the great horned owl, which is sacred to Istreus, the god of magic and mysteries.*

* Süreus the Younger, *Theological Symbology*
