### Snake, Python

Pythons are among the largest species of snakes. Measuring up to 20’ long and weighing up to 180 lbs, they are non-venomous predators that hunt by constriction. They are native to the jungles and swamps of Ulruk, and sometimes bred by the great chiefs of that continent as totems of power. Foolish traders and collectors have more than once allowed the creatures to escape into the wilds of Aurëpos, where they pose a threat to the natural order.

###### Combat

Pythons have **acute olfaction** that grants them a +1 bonus to avoid surprise in their natural habitat. Unlike most animals, they can “see” the heat of living creatures, granting them **lightless vision** to a range of 60’.

A python attacks with its bite, which deals 1d4 {P} damage. When the python successfully bites a creature, it automatically constricts the creature for 2d8 {B} damage and **restrains** it. If the python misses its bite, it can separately attack by constriction. Once it has restrained a creature, the python can automatically deal 2d8 {B} damage on its initiative each round to the restrained creature without having to make an attack throw. Doing so counts as the python’s constriction attack.

###### Ecology

Pythons are solitary creatures, but during breeding season it is not uncommon to find several pythons congregated in close proximity. When a den of pythons is encountered, there is a 10% chance per python that it will be incubating a clutch of 2d6+1 eggs. The eggs have 1 hp and weight 1/20 st. Python snakelets are rarely found in nests, because the snakelets immediately disperse into the wild after they emerge from their eggs.

###### Spoils

A slain python with exceptional attributes can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following components useful in magic research:

* spine (5 st., 300gp, *choking grip, iron maiden*)
* tongue (5/6 st., 50gp, *staffs to snakes, snakes to staffs*)

Pythons can be trained with significant difficulty, though they are somewhat easier to handle than the venomous snakes.

###### Encounter

A **python** of unusually large size dwells in the branches of a great fir tree, its scales an exquisite pattern of black and green.

**Python:** Str 18, Con 18; MV 90’, AC 3, HD 5\*, hp 40, #AT 2 (bite/constrict 3+), Dmg 1d4+3 {P} /2d8+6 {B}, Save F3, ML -1, XP 350; Special: restrain
