### Raptor, Medium

Raptors are birds of prey renowned throughout Aurëpos for their keen vision, swift dives, and sharp talons. Eagles, falcons, hawks, owls, and vultures are all types of raptor. Large raptors include the crowned eagles, desert vultures, eagle owls, fish eagles, fish owls, golden eagles, lammergeiers, rough-legged buzzards, sea eagles, white-back vultures, white-tailed eagles, and similar birds. They weigh about 9 to 15 lbs and measure around 2’ in length with 5’ to 7’ wingspans.

###### Combat

Raptors have **acute vision** and **alertness**, granting them a +2 bonus to avoid surprise in their natural habitat.

Their preferred attack is a **dive attack** with their talons. A dive attack inflicts double the normal damage (2d2/2d2). If the raptor hits a creature smaller than itself with both its talons while making a dive attack, the creature must make a size-adjusted Paralysis saving throw. If the save fails, the creature is **grabbed**.

Certain types of small raptors have additional abilities.

* **Desert Vulture:** These birds only have a speed of 100’/300’ instead of 160’/480’. However, they have **acute olfaction** to smell carrion. As scavengers, they are **immune** to mundane disease and mundane poisonous damage.
* **Eagle Owl:** These birds only have a speed of 100’/300’ instead of 160’/480’. However, they have **acute hearing** and **night vision**. They can **fly silently** on a Sneaking throw of 6+.

###### Ecology

When medium raptors are encountered in their aerie, there is a 35% chance each raptor is guarding eggs or juveniles. Roll 1d10 for age and number: 1 they’re 1d6 eggs, 2-10 they’re 1d2 juvenile raptors. Juvenile raptors of ordinary size have AC 1, Spd 30’, 1 hp, ML -4, and do not fight. Medium raptor eggs have 1 hp and weigh 1/100 st.

###### Spoils

A slain large raptor with exceptional attributes can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following components useful in magic research:

* tail feathers (1/6 st, 3gp, *flight, lay of the land*)
* talons (1/6 st, 3gp, *sharpness, striking*)

A medium raptor’s 6d10 flight feathers each fetch 1d2sp and weigh 1/225 st.

###### Encounter

A grove of dawn redwoods rises high above the other trees here. The redwoods serve as an aerie of **two medium raptors.** The raptors have recently had their eggs stolen, which has left them distempered. Adventurers encountering them suffer a -2 penalty to reaction rolls.
