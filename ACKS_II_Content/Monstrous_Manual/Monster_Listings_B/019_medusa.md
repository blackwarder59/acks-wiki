### Medusa

Sometimes the malice and hate that normally characterizes gorgons gives way to lust for a handsome or virile man. Sometimes the unfortunate recipient of the gorgon’s infatuation is captured and forced to satisfy her carnal desires; other times, a depraved or wicked man might voluntarily unite with a gorgon. Some crazed fools have even go so far as to blind themselves to be able to stay with their monstrous brides.

The offspring of such accursed unions are called medusas. Medusas are indistinguishable from human women, except that they have vicious snakes on their heads rather than hair. Medusas often disguise their true nature by wearing a hooded robe and veil, only to suddenly reveal their horrific aspect at an opportune moment.

Medusas have adopted Draconic as their language. They also speak the local dialects of the region where they grew up.

###### Combat

Medusas rely on the **venomous snakes** that adorn their heads to attack enemies in melee. A creature damaged by a snake bite must make a successful Death saving throw or die of poison 1d4+2 turns later.

In lieu of attacking with its venomous snakes, a medusa can direct its **petrifying gaze** in a cone 60' long and 30' wide in front of itself. Each creature within the cone that is beholding the medusa must make a Paralysis saving throw. If the save succeeds, the creature is not affected. If the save fails, the creature is instantly **petrified**.

###### Ecology

Although some try to blend into human settlements, most medusas dwell on the outskirts of civilization, often in abandoned villas or crumbling ruins. They enjoy the company of others of their kind, forming small coteries or covens.

Medusas can have offspring with both human and elven men. Children of the union (half-medusas) will appear to be ordinary members of their father’s race, albeit sometimes with a birthmark or strange feature. Medusas almost never raise their own children, usually abandoning them to a village or temple.

A medusa that survives until the end of its lifespan (95 years) does not die of old age. Instead, she undergoes a second metamorphosis lasting 1d6 days, during which she transforms into a gorgon (p. XX).

###### Spoils

A slain medusa can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the following components useful in magic research:

* eyes (1 4/6 st, 100gp, *cone of paralysis, hypnotic sigil, petrification*)
* hair-lock of snakes (5/6 st, 50gp, *poison, neutralize poison*)
* skin (5/6 st, 50gp, *depetrification*)
* tongue (5/6 st, 50gp, *disfigure body & soul, holy blessing*)
