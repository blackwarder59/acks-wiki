### Statue, Animated Stone

Statues of various materials can be made into constructs by powerful spellcasters. Those sculpted of stone usually appear as statues of kings, priests, mages, and nobles. They stand around 6’ tall and weigh around 440 lbs.

###### Combat

Unless they engage in some form of movement, animated stone statues appear to be normal statues even upon close inspection. Characters encountering stationary animated statues suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls.

Though animated stone statues appear to be made simply of some kind of stone (alabaster, granite, limestone, porphyry or sandstone are most common), inside the statue there is a large pocket of melted rock and molten lava. In combat, the animated stone statue project this **burning lava** from its fingertips for 2d6 {F!} damage.

Animated stone statues are **immune** to enchantment effects, fire damage, necrotic damage, and poisonous damage. As constructs, they count as enchanted creatures for purposes of spells such as *dispel evil*and *holy circle*.

###### Ecology

As constructs, animated stone statues have no natural habitat. They can be found guarding ancient treasures, dwarven vaults, or places of power or serving powerful spellcasters.

###### Spoils

A destroyed stone statue can be harvested with Magical Engineering for the following component useful in magic research:

* lava slag (5 5/6 st, 350gp, *fan of flame, fireball*)

###### Encounter

Al that remains of the Empyrean temple that once occupied this site is a circular naos of polished white marble surrounded on its perimeter by a ring of tall limestone columns. The roof the columns once supported has collapsed, shattering three of the seven alabaster statues. The four remaining statues – an emperor in a muscle cuirass, a bladedancer in a breastwrap and cloak, a matron in a flowing robe, and a young man in a traveler’s cloak – are recognizable to those with Theology proficiency as statues of Ammonar, Ianna, Mityara, and Naurivus. All fourare **animated stone statues**, and they will attack any creature that fails to present a Lawful holy symbol.

**Animated stone statues (4)**: Spd 60’, AC 5, HD 5\*, hp 25 each, #AT 2 (lava blast 6+), Dmg 2d6 {F!} /2d6 {F!}, Save F5, ML N/A, XP 350; Special: construct immunities, statuary appearance

If the rubble of the collapsed roof is removed (a 1gp construction project), the remains of the temple sanctuary are uncovered. A portion of the temple’s treasury still remains within, including 2000sp, 3000gp, and a whitewood scroll case with a *scroll of cure serious injury, restore life and limb,* and *prophetic dream* written in Classical Auran.
