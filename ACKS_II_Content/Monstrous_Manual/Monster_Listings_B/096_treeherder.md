### Treeherder

A treeherder is an intelligent plant that stands about 18’ tall and weighs almost two tons. It somewhat resembles a human being with barky skin but in lieu of hair it has the crown of a small tree, with leaves that are deep green in the spring and summer and yellow, orange, or red in the fall and winter. When it closes its legs, they fit together so closely as to resemble the trunk of a tree.

A motionless treeherder cannot be distinguished from a tree at a distance of 90’ or more. The type of tree can vary widely -- treeherders seem to have different “ethnicities” that resemble different species of trees that grow around Aurëpos.

Treeherders have the lifespans of great trees and consequently act with caution and prudence at all times. Shorter-lived races such as humans find them tediously slow even to speak with. Treeherders speak their own language and can also **speak with plants** (as the spell). Treeherders that live near humans or elves will usually speak Common or Elven.

Treeherders are sometimes sought out for advice, because they are among the most learned naturalists in the world. They have forgotten more about flora and fauna than human sages have yet learned.

###### Combat

Because of their **tree-like appearance**, creatures encountering treeherders in a forest or other wooded area suffer a -2 penalty to avoid surprise.

As a full-round action, a treeherders can **awaken** up to 2 ordinary trees within a range of 60’. These awakened trees have the physical characteristics of **galdrtrés**, except that they cannot produce enchanting whistles, soporific mists, or bee swarms. The trees remain awake until the treeherder is slain, the tree is destroyed, or the treeherder uses an action in lieu of moving to put them back to sleep. The treeherder can awaken new trees in future rounds, but can never have more than 2 trees awakened at once.

Treeherders have tough bark that makes them **immune** to mundane piercing damage and **resistant** to extraordinary piercing damage. However, they are **susceptible** to fire damage.They save against fire at a-2 penalty and suffer double damage dice.

###### Ecology

Treeherders are found in primordial old-growth forests, which they cultivate much as a human farmer cultivates his crops. They reproduce by dropping seeds from their leaves once each year. A tiny percentage of the seeds develop in the right conditions of soil, water, and magic to become treeherders. Most simply become saplings of whatever type of tree the treeherder resembles.

A slain treant can be harvested with Alchemy for the following components useful in magic research:
