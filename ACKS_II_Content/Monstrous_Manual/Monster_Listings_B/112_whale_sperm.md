### Whale, Sperm

These gigantic whales typically reach a length of 60' and a weight of 120,000 lbs. Their huge, box-like heads can take up one-third of their length while their huge tail flukes can measure up to 15’ long. Like other whales, they are highly intelligent and social creatures capable of speaking a song-like language.

###### Combat

Sperm whales use **aquatic mechanoreception** to “see” in water up to 600’. Spells or effects that would ordinarily cause blindness do not affect the whale while it is using aquatic mechanoreception. However, creatures that are not in the water are invisible to them. Aquatic mechanoreception does not penetrate structures or terrain features.

While not able to breathe water, sperm whales can **hold their breath** for 9 turns (90 minutes). Despite their size, they are **prodigious leapers**; a sperm whale that charges on its initiative can jump up to 15’ vertically and horizontally out of the water at any point in its movement. When it lands in the water, it creates a huge splash. Creatures within 60’ of the splash suffer a -2 penalty to Swimming and Seafaring throws until the end of their next initiative.

If a sperm whale succeeds on a bite attack against a creature of huge size or less with an unmodified throw of 18 - 20, it can **swallow** the creature. The swallowed creature suffers 3d20 {A!} damage at the starts of its initiative each round and drowns after 10 rounds. If the swallowed creature has a tiny, small, or natural piercing or slashing weapon, it can attack the whale from inside its belly with an attack penalty of -4. Should a swallowed creature die and remain in the whale’s belly for 6 turns, it is irrecoverably digested. The whale can cleave after swallowing a creature.

When a sperm whale encounters a sea vessel, it usually leaves it undisturbed, but sometimes it will ram the vessel, dealing 6d6 {B!} structural damage.

###### Ecology

When a pod of sperm whales is encountered, there is a 25% chance the adults will be accompanied by 1d3 juveniles and 1d3 babies. Juvenile sperm whales are gigantic size, have AC 1, Spd 150’, HD 18, and attack with 1 bite (3d10 {P!}). Baby sperm whales are huge size, have AC 0, Spd 150’, HD 12, and attack with 1 bite (3d4 {P!}). Both can swallow targets whole.

###### Spoils

Because of their propensity to swallow creatures whole, an encounter with wandering sperm whales might yield treasure. The treasure (if any) is always found inside the whale’s belly.

A slain sperm whale can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following components useful in magic research:

* air sacs (110 st, 6,500gp, *battering ram, capsizing wave, circle of agony, swimming,* armor +1).
* spermaceti (100 st, 6,000gp, *illumination, kindle flame, slickness, water walking*)

A sperm whale’s dentition fetches 60gp and weigh 1 st.

###### Lore

*The head-wax of the great whale possesses an incendiary virtue that catalyzes alchemic concoctions of light and fire. This same virtue would certainly make the head-wax a valuable fuel for the industrial automatons of the dwarven machinists. Be glad they do not take to sea! The harpoons of the dwarves would likely empty the waters of whales, just as the axes of the dwarves have emptied the mountains of our trees.*

* Caoláin, *The Illuminated Primer of Alchemy*
