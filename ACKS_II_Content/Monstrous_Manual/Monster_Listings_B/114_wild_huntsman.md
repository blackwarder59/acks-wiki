### Wild Huntsman

At the height of the Argollëan Empire, elven hunter-cultists devoted to the chthonic god Nargund formed hunting parties that sought mighty game throughout the Meniri Mountains. The terrified humans who witnessed these festivals of slaughter dubbed them “Wild Hunts,” a name which passed into legend and folklore.

The predations of the Wild Hunt were vast, but not capricious. Every beast the Wild Hunt slew was actually sacrifice to their dark god intended to immortalize their souls. In that, they succeeded: Two thousand years later, the Wild Hunt continues to ride, its members having transcended death to become incorporeal undead known as wild hunters.

Wild huntsmen appear as incorporeal cataphracts mounted on steeds of tenebrous mist that soar through the heavens in pursuit of prey. They manifest in our sphere only when the eight-starred constellation of the Wolf is visible, and always number exactly eight. They will not attack those taking sanctuary on holy ground, nor will they assail the havens of their former race, but all others they encounter are considered fair game.

###### Combat

Any creature struck by a wild huntsman’s arrow or lance must make a Paralysis saving throw. If the save succeeds, the creature suffers damage from the attack but no other ill effect. If the save fails the creature suffers damage and is **faltering** until the end of its next initiative. However:

* If already faltering, the creature instead suffers an additional die of damage and is **frightened** until the end of its next initiative.
* If already frightened, the creature instead suffers two additional dice of damage.

If a creature is reduced to 0 hp by the attack of a wild huntsman it is slain and cannot be restored to life save by ritual magic*.* One day after the creature dies, it manifests as a **haunt** somewhere within 300’ of where it died (see p. XX).

A wild huntsman usually prefers to fight from the air, launching spectral arrows from its composite bow out to a range of 360’ with no range penalties. The wild huntsmen are **precise shots** (as the proficiency) and delight in showing off their archery prowess.

Confronted with a formidable foe, however, a wild huntsman might charge with its spectral lance. Being incorporeal, the lance does not cause impact damage. However, it is **terrifying**.When the wild huntsman completes its charge, any creatures within 10’ must make a Paralysis saving throw. If the save fails, the creature becomes **frightened**. If the save succeeds, the effect depends on the creature’s Hit Dice. If the creature has less than 1 HD, it still becomes frightened. If it has 1 HD or more, but less than 3 HD, the creature starts faltering. If it has 3 HD or more, the creature is unaffected by terror. The condition lasts until the end of the creature’s next initiative.

The steeds of the Wild Hunt have no independent existence and cannot be targeted or affected by spells. Any attacks aimed against the steeds count as attacks against the wild huntsman mounted on it.

Wild huntsmen are **immune** to enchantment effects, necrotic damage, poisonous damage, and all mundane damage. As **incorporeal** beings, natural and non-magical weapons always deal mundane damage against them, even if the creature would otherwise deal extraordinary damage. They are inherently evil for purposes of *discern evil*and *holy circle*spells and are rebuked as specters.

When a wild huntsman is reduced to 0 hp, it dissipates, but it is not permanently destroyed. A dissipated wild huntsman recovers on the next night of the wild hunt at full hit points. The members of the Wild Hunt can only be permanently destroyed if all eight are slain in the same night before consummating their hunt.

###### Ecology

Any time it manifests, the Wild Hunt will always contains 7 wild huntsmen led by a lord with 9 Hit Dice. The lord of the Wild Hunt can cast *summon weather*once per day. If the Wild Hunt is called to ride by day, the lord will use this ability to guarantee that a dark mist or fog falls over the land.

The Wild Hunt has no lair; anytime it is encountered, it will be on the move. It feeds on the life-energy released when the hunters turn living creatures into haunts. The wild huntsmen collectively share this energy, which is both their strength and weakness. If the Wild Hunt as a whole fails to create at least 50 HD worth of haunts each time it manifests, the entire Wild Hunt is destroyed.

Wild hunters are repelled by the light of Ammonar. They suffer a -2 penalty to attack throws, proficiency throws, and morale rolls in clear daylight. In addition, none of the members of the Wild Hunt can enter pinnacles of good or move within 3 miles of an elven fastness.

###### Spoils

A destroyed wild hunter can be harvested with Alchemy 2 for the following component useful in magic research:

* ectoplasm (17 5/6 st – 41 4/6 st, 1,070gp – 2,500gp, *deflect ordinary weapons, locate haunting, phantasmal horror, spectral legion, spiritwalk*)
