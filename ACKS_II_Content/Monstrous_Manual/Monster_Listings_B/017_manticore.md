### Manticore

Manticores are man-eating monsters with the faces of bearded men, the bodies of lions, the wings of giant bats, and the tails of giant scorpions. The tails terminate in a cluster of 24 barbed stingers arranged in rows like a morning star’s spikes. A typical manticore has a length of 10’, a wing span of 30’, and a weight of 1,000 lbs.

Zaharan myth professes that the first manticores were born of the union of Nasga, Chthonic goddess of beauty and pain, with Bel, Chthonic god of war. If so, then the creatures can rightly be said to have inherited the bloodthirstiness of their father and the sadism of their mother. They delight in feasting on living human flesh, favoring it above all other meat.

Manticores usually live in the mountains, but have been known to venture into dungeons, either in service to some powerful chaotic master or to be closer to prey.

Though sapient, manticores do not have their own language. They use the common languages spoken by the humans and beastmen in the regions they inhabit.

###### Combat

Manticores have **acute olfaction** that grants them a +1 bonus to avoid surprise in their natural habitat. They can track the scent of creatures for up to 4 miles with the equivalent of two ranks of Tracking proficiency.

The monsters are **masterful mimics** and can imitate the vocalizations of any animal, demi-human, or human on a successful proficiency throw of 3+. They use this ability to bait and lure prey to their doom.

A manticore usually prefers to attack from range (often while flying), hurling spikes from its tail at targets up to 270’ away. Once its prey is wounded and weakened, the manticore will move into melee to finish it off with claws and bite. Hurled spikes regrow at a rate of 2 per day.

###### Ecology

Manticores breed but rarely, and even after the eggs hatch, the juveniles require considerable care, for they can neither fly nor hurl tail spikes. When manticores are encountered in their lair, there is a 20% chance each manticore is guarding offspring. Roll 1d4 for their number and age: 1-2, it’s 1d4 eggs, 3-4, it’s 1d3 juveniles. Juvenile manticores have AC 3, Spd 90’, HD 3, and attack with 2 talons (1 {P}) and 1 nibble (1 {P}). Manticore eggs have 1 hp and weigh 1/6 st.

Manticores defending their young do not have to make morale rolls; they always fight to the death.
