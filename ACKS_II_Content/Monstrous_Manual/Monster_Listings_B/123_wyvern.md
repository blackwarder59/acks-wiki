### Wyvern

The first wyverns were created by the Thrassians, who bred wyvern-form dragons with giant scorpions to create a bestial flying monster with a pair of a talons and a poisonous stinger in its tail. An average wyvern’s body measures 15' long and weighs about 1,500 lbs, while its wing span stretches 45’. Their scales range from dark brown to gray, though jet black and ivory wyverns are occasionally seen.

Wyverns are most common in the cliffs of the Dark Wall and the Waste were they were created, though over time they have proliferated through the entire Meniri and Jutting Mountain ranges.

Due to the verminous blood introduced in their breeding, wyverns lack the sapiency of dragons, though they are so clever as to count as semi-sapient. They are nevertheless difficult to train due to their foul disposition and vicious temper.

###### Combat

When fighting on land, a wyvern can attack with its bite and **poisoned stinger**. A creature damaged by the stinger must make a successful Death saving throw or die at the end of the wyvern’s initiative.

When fighting from air, a wyvern can attack with bite and tail, or it can make a **dive attack** with its talons. A dive attack inflicts double the normal damage (4d8 {S!} / 4d8 {S!}). If the wyvern hits a creature smaller than itself with both its talons, the creature must make a size-adjusted Paralysis saving throw. If the save fails, the creature is **grabbed**.

###### Ecology

When wyverns are encountered in their aerie, there is a 25% chance each wyvern will be guarding offspring. Roll 1d4 for number and age: 1-2, it’s 1d6 eggs, 3-4 it’s 1d3 juveniles. Juvenile wyverns have AC 4, Spd 60’, HD 3+2, and attack with bite (1d8 {P}) and stinger (1d8 {P}). Juvenile wyverns cannot fly nor do their stingers carry venom. Wyverns will fight to the death to defend their offspring without checking morale.

###### Spoils

A slain wyvern can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the following components useful in magic research:

* eyes (2 st, 120gp, *locate distant object*)
* stinger (6 st, 360gp, *neutralize poison, poison*)
* talons (6 st, 360gp, *sharpness, striking,* weapon +2)
* wingtips (5 st, 300gp, *flight, winged flight*)

If not used for magic research, a wyvern’s stinger fetches 16gp and weighs 2/6 st and its two talons each fetch 16gp and weigh 2/6 st. A wyvern’s two horns each fetch 1d4x8gp and weigh 1 st per 80gp.

Its venom (onset time 1 round, +1 saving modifier, 7d6 {Po} damage on failed Death saving throw) fetches 600gp and weighs 1/6 st.
