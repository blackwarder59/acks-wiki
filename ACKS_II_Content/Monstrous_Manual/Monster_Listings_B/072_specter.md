### Specter

Specters are powerful incorporeal undead that maintain their unholy existence by draining the life-force of the living. Some Chthonic cultists voluntary chose to become specters to await the Awakening. Others were cursed, punished, or otherwise damned to the state of undeath.

A specter looks much as it did just before its death, though it is weightless and slightly transparent. It can be easily recognized by those who knew the specter in life, or have seen its face in paintings or statues. If the specter’s mortal life ended violently, the terrible wounds that claimed its life will be visible on its ghostly body.

###### Combat

Specters are dreaded for their **enervating touch**. When a specter successfully attacks a living creature, it deals 1d8 {N!} damage to the creature, then permanently reduces the target’s maximum hp by an amount equal to the damage dealt. If the creature’s hp are reduced to 0, the creature is slain.

If not slain, the creature becomes **enervated**.An enervated creature must make a Death saving throw each day when it wakes from resting. If the save fails, the creature permanently reduces its maximum hp by another point. If the save succeeds, the creature does not reduce its maximum hp further that day. If a creature’s hp are reduced to 0 by the enervating touch, the creature is slain. if the save succeeds three times in a row, the condition ends. Otherwise, a creature can only end the condition and restore its maximum hp via ritual magic.

If a creature is slain by the enervating touch or enervated condition, it cannot be restored to life save by ritual magic*.* One day after the creature dies, it manifests as a **haunt** somewhere within 300’ of where it died (see p. XX).

Specters are **immune** to enchantment effects, necrotic damage, poisonous damage, and all mundane damage. As **incorporeal** beings, natural and non-magical weapons always deal mundane damage against them, even if the creature would otherwise deal extraordinary damage. They are inherently evil for purposes of *discern evil*and *holy circle*spells and are rebuked as specters.

###### Ecology

Specters are most commonly encountered in chaotic temples, places of death, and other sinkholes of evil. However, some haunt the homes of their own past lives, or wander the countryside in dismal pilgrimages.

A specter feeds on the life-energy released when a living creature becomes a haunt. If it does not create at least one haunt per month, it loses 1 HD. It can replenish lost HD by creating additional haunts. However, if ever reduced to 1 HD, the specter permanently becomes a haunt itself. A specter that resides in a sinkhole of evil can sustain itself from the ambient energies of the sinkhole and does not have to feed.
