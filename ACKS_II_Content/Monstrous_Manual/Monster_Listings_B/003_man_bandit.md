### Man, Bandit

As the great civilizations of Aurëpos have slowly crumbled into a dark age of disorder and violence, more and more commoners have rebuked to outlawry – some from desperation, others from opportunism. Banditry is now an ever-present danger on even the safest highways of Aurëpos.

Most (85%) of bandits are Chaotic, not because they consciously serve the chthonic cause but because they actively work to undermine the law and order of civilization. A small number (15%), who limit themselves to preying on the corrupt and dishonest, count as Neutral. The latter sometimes become folk heroes to the common people, and adventurers who capture or slay them might earn the ire, rather than praise, of the locals.

###### Combat

Bandits have all the **thief skills** of 1st level thieves. In addition, they are experts at **waylaying enemies** in ambushes (Skulking proficiency) and **surviving in the wild** (Survival proficiency).

In combat, they prefer to attack by surprise or from the rear. They can **backstab** with melee weapons or missile weapons at short range, gaining a +4 bonus to attack and dealing an additional damage die if they hit.

Bandits will usually be equipped with short bows, short swords, 2 daggers, and leather armor. Bandit leaders will carry thieves’ tools but the bandit gang members will usually not.

###### Ecology

Each bandit gang will be led by a 2nd level thief. Each bandit band will be led by a 3rd level thief. Each bandit camp will be run by a 5th level thief boss.

When bandits are encountered in a camp, certain additional creatures will be present. There is a 75% chance the camp will be guarded by 1d4 war dogs with spiked leather barding. The boss will always by guarded by a thuggish 4th level fighter. In addition, there is a 50% chance for a 4th level assassin and a 50% chance for a 4th level mage to be employed by the boss.

###### Spoils

A slain bandit can be harvested with Healing 1 for the following component useful in magic research:

* heart (1/6 st, 6gp, *beguile humanoid*)

Bandits do not have magic items by treasure type. Instead, bandit leaders should be assigned magic items using the ***ACKS II JJ***rules (p. XX), whether they are in lair or not.

###### Notes

This monster listing is just an example. It assumes that bandits are 1st level thieves. The GM should feel free to devise other bandits for other regions with different proficiencies and equipment.
