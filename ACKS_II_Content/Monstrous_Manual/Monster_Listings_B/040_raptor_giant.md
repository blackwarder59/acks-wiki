### Raptor, Giant

Raptors are birds of prey renowned throughout Aurëpos for their keen vision, swift dives, and sharp talons. Eagles, falcons, hawks, owls, and vultures are all types of raptor. Giant raptors include the giant teratorns, great elfhawks, and similar birds of impressive size. They weigh about 150 to 175 lbs and measure around 8’ to 11’ in length with 25’ to 30’ wingspans.

###### Combat

Raptors have **acute vision** and **alertness**, granting them a +2 bonus to avoid surprise in their natural habitat.

Their preferred attack is a **dive attack** with their talons. A dive attack inflicts double the normal damage (2d4 {S} / 2d4 {S}). If the raptor hits a creature smaller than itself with both its talons while making a dive attack, the creature must make a size-adjusted Paralysis saving throw. If the save fails, the creature is **grabbed**.

###### Ecology

When giant raptors are encountered in their aerie, there is a 33% chance each raptor is guarding eggs or juveniles. Roll 1d10 for age and number: 1 it’s 1d4 eggs, 2-10 it’s 1d2 juvenile raptors. Juvenile raptors of giant size have AC 1, Spd 30’, HD 1, and 2 talons (1d2 {S}). Giant raptor eggs have 1 hp and weigh 1/6 st.

###### Spoils

A slain giant raptor can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following components useful in magic research:

* tail feathers (1t s, 60gp, *flight, lay of the land*)
* talons (4/6 st, 40gp, *sharpness, striking*)

A giant raptor’s 6d10 flight feathers each fetch 1d6gp and weigh 1/25 st.

Trained giant raptors are commonly used as guards in elven fastnesses.

###### Encounter

Visible on a nearby summit is a colossal humanoid skeleton, over 110’ tall, the remains of some dead titan of antiquity. The petrified skeleton is now the aerie of **three giant raptors**, who have made nests in its bones. The two larger raptors are a mated pair tending a clutch of **four eggs**.

**Giant raptors (3):** Spd 60’ / 450’ fly, AC 2, HD 3+3, hp 20, 18, 11, #AT 2 (talons 7+), Dmg 1d6 {S} / 1d6 {S}, Save F2, ML 0, AL N, XP 65; Special: dive attack
