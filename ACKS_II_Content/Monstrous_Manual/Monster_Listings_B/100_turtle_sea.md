### Turtle, Sea

These aquatic turtles can be up to 9’ long and weigh as much as to 2000 lbs. Their leathery shells are softer than those of hard-shelled land turtles, which allows for more flexibility in movement. They have beaked mouths with sharp, toothless jaws and long, powerful flippers that make them graceful swimmers and awkward crawlers. Unlike most turtles, they are unable to withdraw their head and limbs into their shells, and must instead rely on their fierce bites for defense.

###### Combat

Sea turtles have **acute olfaction.** They gain a +1 bonus to avoid surprise in their natural habitat.

Though sea turtles are agile in water, they are **ponderously slow** on land. If caught out of the water, their AC is reduced by 2 (from 4 to 2) and they suffer a -2 penalty to initiative rolls.

Sea turtles are **immune** to the stings of jellyfish, which are among their primary prey.

###### Ecology

Sea turtles are solitary creatures and rarely congregate. The males never venture onto land, while the females venture onto land only to lay eggs. After depositing their eggs in on the beach, the turtles return to the sea, leaving the hatchlings to fend for themselves once they emerge. Hatchlings make their way to the sea alone and begin their solitary lives in the ocean.

###### Spoils

A slain sea turtle with extraordinary characteristics can be harvested with Magical Engineering for the following component useful in magic research:

* beak (1 stone, 65gp, *arcane armor, divine armor, swimming*)

A sea turtle’s leathery shell fetches 110gp and weighs 40 st.

###### Lore

*During our voyages across the Ammas Aurë we saw a number of sea turtles of substantial size – but these weighed perhaps one ton. Legends of giant dragon-sized turtles large enough to carry a village on their shell must, I believe, be considered entirely unfounded.*

* Toraster the Elder, *Bestiary of Aurëpos*
