### Man, Berserker

From time to time, young men from Jutland and other barbaric regions come together to form cultic warrior brotherhoods dedicated to battle. Such men are known as berserkers for the battle lust that overtakes them in battle. They rove far and wide throughout Aurëpos, sometimes earning their keep as mercenaries or housecarls and other times simply taking what they want with fire and sword.

Most (75%) Jutlandic berserkers venerate Tür, god of strength, but a minority (25%) are Chaotic cultists of Baleyg, god of bloodlust and battle. The former tend to fight for glory or plunder, but the latter will give battle simply for the joy of bloodshed. (The Aurans refer to these gods as Türas and Bel, respectively.)

###### Combat

Berserkers have **animal reflexes** and gain a +1 bonus to initiative. As raiders and looters, they are **naturally stealthy** before they go berserk, so characters encountering them suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls. As **skilled warriors** they gain a +1 damage bonus.

A berserker can enter a **berserker rage** anytime he makes an attack. While enraged, he gains a +2 bonus to attack throws and becomes immune to fear. However, the berserker has a -2 penalty to AC and becomes limited in his tactics. He cannot conduct defensive movement to retreat or withdraw from an enemy within 5’ and cannot move in such a way that the range between himself and the nearest visible threat would increase. He must advance 5’ after cleaving if necessary to do so to engage an enemy and he has sufficient movement. Once it has begun, a berserker rage cannot be ended until combat ends.

50% of berserker gangs will be equipped with will be equipped with spears, hand axes, shields, and chain mail and 50% will be equipped with great axes and chainmail armor.

###### Ecology

Each berserker gang will be led by a 2nd level barbarian. Each berserker warband will be led by a 3rd level barbarian. Each berserker camp will be captained by a 4th level barbarian.

###### Spoils

A slain berserker can be harvested with Healing 1 for the following component useful in magic research:

* heart (1/6 st, 10gp, *beguile humanoid*)

Berserkers do not have magic items by treasure type. Instead, berserker leaders should be assigned magic items using the ***ACKS II JJ***rules (p. XX), whether they are in lair or not.

###### Notes

This monster listing is just an example. It assumes that berserkers are 1st level Jutland barbarians. The GM should feel free to devise other berserkers for other regions with different proficiencies and equipment.

This monster entry can be used to represent professional housecarls by replacing Berserkergang proficiency with Fighting Style (weapon & shield) proficiency.
