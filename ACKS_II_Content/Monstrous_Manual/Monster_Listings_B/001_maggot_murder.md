### Maggot, Murder

These carnivorous horrors are disgusting to behold. Their inch-long segmented cylindrical bodies, adorned all over with tiny bristling setae, are the color of white bone and yellow pus. Their fleshy heads terminate in hook-like mandibles that remorselessly scythe everything in their path. Unfortunately for adventurers, that’s almost exactly what ordinary maggots look like, too. Only a successful Naturalism proficiency throw at -4 can identify murder maggots as anything other than the common sort of disgusting grubs that just eat rotting meat and grow into flies.

###### Combat

Broods of murder maggots often lurk in corpses, piles of animal waste, rotten vegetation, and similar objects or areas. They are always **hidden**. A creature using a 10’ pole that makes a successful Searching throw can safely reveal the maggots’ presence in an object or area, but any creature that touches or searches an infested object or area without such precautions automatically triggers an attack by the brood.

The maggots immediately fling themselves at any living creatures within 5’ of the infested object or area. Divide the maggots evenly across the available targets. Each creature targeted must make a Blast saving throw with a penalty equal to the number of maggots targeting it. If the save succeeds, the target creature stomps, swats, or otherwise kills all the maggots before they can burrow into its body. If the save fails, then the target creature fails to kill some of the maggots – for each 3 points by which it failed the save, one maggot burrows into a bodily orifice (round up). The victim immediately takes 1 necrotic damage per maggot.

Once murder maggots have begun burrowing into the body, the victim has just a few minutes (2d4 rounds) before they are too deep for easy excision. Each round, the victim and/or one ally can cauterize or excise one maggot as a full-round action. Cauterizing deals 1d4 {F} damage to the victim. Excising deals 1d6 {S} damage, but the damage is reduced by 1 hp per rank of Healing proficiency the victim or ally possesses (e.g. skilled healers are better at safely excising maggots.) Once the maggots are deep in the victim’s body, only *cure disease* (by spell or proficiency) can remove them.

If not removed or killed, the maggots burrow ceaselessly through the victim’s body, inflicting 1 necrotic damage per turn per maggot. If the victim is reduced to 0 hp, he dies.

###### Ecology

Although they resemble the larval form of flies, murder maggots are a distinct species. They emerge from their eggs full grown and do not metamorphize or pupate into other forms. Each murder maggot can lay eggs once per year.

###### Spoils

A slain murder maggot can be harvested with Animal Husbandry 2 for the following component useful in magic research:

* dried grub (1/6 st., 5gp, *cause injury, extinguish life, incite madness*)
