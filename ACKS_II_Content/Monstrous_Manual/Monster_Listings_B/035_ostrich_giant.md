### Ostrich, Giant

The giant ostrich is a flightless bird of great size, a typical specimen standing 10’ tall and weighing 450 lbs. Its plumage is drab gray, except for its colorful throat and head. Its beak is long and vicious and has earned it the moniker “terror bird.”

An atavistic remnant of an era when the reptilian ancestors of birds ruled the world, giant ostriches are rarely seen in Aurëpos. However, adventurers who have explored the vastness of Ulruk claim they are not uncommon there. Some even assert that the tribesmen of Ulruk have domesticated the giant ostrich, and ride the creatures into battle the way civilized men ride horses.

###### Combat

Not only can a giant ostrich tear the flesh of its prey with its axe-like beak, but its clawed feet can deliver a murderous kick. The ostrich’s attacks are vicious that it often **eviscerates** its prey and tears apart its limbs. Any creature reduced to 0 or fewer hp by a terror bird suffers a -4 penalty on its subsequent Mortal Wounds roll.

###### Ecology

When a giant ostrich nest is encountered, there is a 25% chance each ostrich is rearing offspring. If so, roll 1d4 for age and number: 1, it’s 2d10 eggs; 2-4 it’s 1d8 juveniles. Juvenile terror birds have AC 3, Spd 240’, 3 HD, and attack with 2 kicks (1d2 {B}) and bite (1d2 {P}). Eggs have 1 hp and weigh 3/6 st.

###### Spoils

A slain ostrich can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) for the following components useful in magic research:

* beak (5 st, 300gp, *beast growth, dismember,* +1 weapon)
* talons (4 3/6 st., 270gp, *avian messenger, swift sword*)

If not used for magic research, a giant ostrich’s two talons each fetch 4gp and weigh 1/6 st. Its 6d10 flight feathers each fetch 1d6gp and weigh 1/25 st.

Giant ostriches can be tamed and trained, albeit not so easily as dogs or horses. Because of their speed and prowess, they sometimes find use as war mounts in the Sunset Kingdoms.

###### Lore

*To celebrate his triumph at the Battle of Trikala, Ulkyreus sponsored the most spectacular games ever held in Aura. Throughout the summer of 226 IY, the citizens of the Great City thrilled to chariot races, gladiatorial duels, mock battles, epic plays, and public executions. The most famous of these events was a ball game in which teams of riders mounted on so-called “terror birds” scored points by kicking a bronze helmet (representing the head of the defeated Somirean king) through gateways on either end of the Great Arena. The game ended in glorious havoc when one of the giant ostriches leaped into the mezzanine and tore apart a pair of senators before itself being slain. An inquest by the Emperor’s Talons after the event revealed that the senators had been conspiring to assassinate the Tarkaun, and their death was ruled a rightful execution.*
