### Necropede

A necropede is a terrible abomination, the necromantic fusion of multiple humanoid torsos, stitched in-line, the creation's many arms serving as legs, propelling the foul thing swiftly across all manner of terrain, and even up walls and cliffs.

Most necropedes are constructed using six torsos, but can be made with as few as two or as many as a dozen. They have 1 HD per torso and one attack per two torsos.

###### Combat

In combat, the necropede slams into its target with its many arms, seeking to grasp it firmly and crush the life out of it. If the necropede hits a creature smaller than itself with at least two slams in the same attack routine, the creature must make a size-adjusted Paralysis saving throw. If the save fails, the creature is **grabbed**.

Thereafter, while the creature remains grabbed, the necropede can automatically deal 1d8 {B!} damage per attack in its attack routine on its initiative each round to the grabbed creature without having to make an attack throw. Doing so counts as the necropede’s full attack routine.

As undead, necropedes are immune to enchantment effects and poisonous damage. They are inherently evil for purposes of *discern evil*and *holy circle*spells. They are rebuked as specters.

###### Ecology

As undead constructs, necropedes have no natural habitat. They are usually found serving powerful necromancers or lingering in the abandoned ruins of ancient and evil civilizations.

###### Spoils

A destroyed necropede can be harvested with Healing 2 for the following components useful in magic research:

* head (5 5/6 st., 290gp*, deathless minion, unliving puppet, wall of corpses*)
* upper arms (4 st., 240gp, *choking grip, iron maiden*)
* lower arms (4 st., 240gp, *spider climb, swift strike*)

###### Encounter

The Auran Empire constructs hospitals in the countryside where the sick can be cared for without risk of contagion to settled areas. One such hospital is nestled in a dell here. The hospital is 75’ square, with an inner and outer ring of rooms connected to each other by an arcade. The rooms along the arcade were once wards, dormitories, and closets. All contain grisly evidence of terrible experiments. The beds have been fitted with leather straps, and show great tears and rents; most are black with blood. Blood-stained surgical tools, including bone chisels, surgical saws, scalpels, sharp hooks, and rolls of flax thread, are piled in a gory heap in a corner closet.

The arcade surrounds a 25’ square interior courtyard open to the sky. At its center a white marble statue of Mityara has fallen and shattered. Around the statue, a garden has grown wild with weeds and shrubs. Here lurk the hideous experiments, a **pair of necropedes.**

Beneath the blood-stained tools in the closet is a locked coffer that once belonged to the hospital’s priestess. It holds 2,000ep and **two** **potions of cure moderate injury.** The key to the coffer is inside the belly of the larger necropede.
