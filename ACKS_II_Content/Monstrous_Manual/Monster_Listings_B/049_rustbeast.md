### Rustbeast

According to popular legend, the first rustbeasts were created by a peace-loving elven wizard who hoped to put an end to wars by destroying the metal that enabled warriors to fight them. Ironically, the wizard was ultimately killed by a crossbow bolt shot by a dwarf angry over the loss of his magic axe to one of the beasts – or so the story goes. Apocryphal as the tale may be, all agree that rusts beasts do in fact have the power to destroy metal they contact.

Adventurers who have encountered rustbeasts describe them as rust-colored crocodile with long scaly tails and strange antennae-like feelers erupting from their snouts. A typical rustbeast measures 5’ long, stands 3’ tall, and weighs 200 lbs.

###### Combat

A rustbeast has **acute olfaction** that is attuned to the scent of metal. It gains a +1 bonus to avoid surprise when encountering creatures equipped with 1 stone or more of metal arms, armor, or coin.

In combat, a rustbeast will engage whichever creatures are carrying the most stones of metal arms, armor, equipment, and coins. When attacking, it can ignore the target’s AC from armor, but not AC from DEX, magic items, natural armor, or spells. If it hits, it destroys a fraction of the metal on the target:

* First, a metal shield carried by the target, if any; then
* A metal weapon carried by the target, if any; then
* Any metal armor worn by the target; then
* Any metal coin or gear on the target (1 st. worth)

Non-magical metal is destroyed automatically. Magical metal is destroyed unless it succeeds on a Death save (use the wearer’s target value, adding any magic bonus if applicable).

If a rustbeast hits a target that is not carrying any metal whatsoever, its attack deals 1d4 {A!} damage. However, it will only attack such targets in retaliation for being attacked. If left unprovoked, it will prefer to feed on the ashes left by its corrosive powers.

If a creature strikes a rustbeast with a metal weapon, the weapon is destroyed, automatically if mundane and on a failed Death save is magical. If the weapon is destroyed, it crumbles to dust before dealing damage to the rust beast.

###### Ecology

When a wilderness den of rustbeasts is encountered, there is a 10% chance per rustbeast that it will be incubating a clutch of 1d4 eggs. The eggs have 1 hp and weight 1/60 st. Rustbeast hatchlings are rarely found in nests, because the hatchlings immediately disperse after they emerge from their eggs.

###### Spoils

A slain rust beast can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the following component useful in magic research:

* antennae (6 st, 350gp, *crafting, disintegration, shatter blade, turn to dust, wall of annihilation*)

Because of their ability to “smell” metal, trained rustbeasts are sometimes used by dwarven excavators to assist them in prospecting for veins of ore, much as pigs are used to find truffles.
