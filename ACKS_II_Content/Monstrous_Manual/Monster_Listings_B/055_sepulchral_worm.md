### Sepulchral Worm

When a dead body is mummified, it is customary to remove the intestines, along with other organs, for preservation in canopic jars. If, instead, the intestines are left inside the corpse, and the corpse is then necromantically transformed into an undead mummy, then the intestines will transform too, becoming sepulchral worms: Writhing, biting, snake-like maggots that erupt from the mummy’s abdomen. Sepulchral worms are considered a blessing by the mad priests of Dirgion, who honor their martyrs and bishops by cultivating infestations in their undead bodies.

###### Combat

A mummy can be infested by up to 15 sepulchral worms. Sepulchral worms make any mummy they infest more fearsome. Characters encountering an infested mummy suffer a -1 penalty per 3 worms (rounded down) to their Paralysis saving throw against its horror. For instance, if a mummy has 11 sepulchral worms erupting from its abdomen, characters encountering the mummy suffer a -3 save penalty.

On an infested mummy’s initiative, each of the sepulchral worms in its body can spurt out like tentacles from its abdomen to bite living creatures within 15’. Each successful bite deals 1d4 {N!} {P!} damage. Any creature damaged by a bite begins **rotting**, just as if struck by a mummy.

Sepulchral worms are **immune** to enchantment effects, to necrotic and poisonous damage, and to mundane acidic, bludgeoning, cold, electric, piercing, seismic, and slashing damage. They are **resistant** to mundane fire damage and to extraordinary acidic, bludgeoning, cold, electric, piercing, seismic, and slashing damage. However, even a splash from holy water kills sepulchral worms instantly. They are rebuked as skeletons, separately from the mummy they infest.

Should sepulchral worms be rebuked while the mummy they infest is not, the worms **cower** and writhe in their mummy’s belly. Should the mummy they infest be destroyed, the sepulchral worms in its belly survive for one turn as independent undead. During this time they can move with a combat speed of 30’ per round.

###### Ecology

Sepulchral worms have no independent existence. They are only found in the undead mummies they infest.

###### Spoils

A destroyed sepulchral worm can be harvested with Healing 2 for the following components useful in magic research:

* desiccated worm (2/6 st., 16gp, *cause disease, inspire horror, summon insect plague*)

###### Lore

*Blessed are the green worms of putrefaction which crawl upon the sacred scions. Blessed are the brave souls whose indomitable will animates the rotting cadavers. Let the worm spread and the blessed gift of undeath spread.*

* Ishme-Dagon, *The Corporium,* Vol. 4 “On the Animation of Sepulchral Worms”
