### Lycanthrope, Wererat

Wererats are lycanthropes who can transform into giant rats and ratmen. In their human form, they often have beady eyes, receding chins, whiskery mustaches, and pointed ears. In all their forms they remain around the same weight and size.

The Chthonic god Galmorm, the Horned Rat, god of lies, treachery, and sabotage, created the first wererats in order to further his divine agenda.

Unlike other lycanthropes, which have only two forms (human and beast), wererats can assume an **intermediate form** resembling a humanoid ratman. A wererat in this form can wield human weapons and speak human languages, but retains all of the special abilities of beast form.

Most wererats were born lycanthropes and see themselves as part of a distinct species, superior to ordinary humanity. Since wererats tend to fight with weapons in intermediate form, they rarely transmit lycanthropy by bite. From time to time, however, the cunning creatures will strategically transmit their disease to “worthy” recruits who would be useful for their contacts or wealth.

###### Combat

In beast and intermediate form, wererats have **acute hearing** and gain a +1 bonus to avoid surprise in its natural habitat. They are **skilled climbers**, able to ascend sheer surfaces as if they were thieves (5+).

In all three forms, wererats are **naturally stealthy**. Characters encountering them suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls.

Wererats hate fair fights and prefer assassination and ambush. They often equip themselves like thieves with weapons such as crossbows, daggers, saps, and short swords. Where available, wererats will use poisoned weapons.

###### Ecology

Wererats prefer to live in or near human settlements, favoring large towns and cities with extensive sewer systems. They dwell in packs, with a core of closely-related family along with various recent recruits.

When wererats are encountered in their lair, they have a 75% chance to be accompanied by a nest of 3d10 giant rats.

###### Spoils

A slain wererat can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the following components useful in magic research:

* blood (3/6 st, 35gp, *deflect ordinary weapons, skinchange*)
* scalp (3/6 st, 30gp, *silent step, transform beast*)

Because they revert to human form when slain, wererats cannot be harvested for claws, fangs, or fur.
