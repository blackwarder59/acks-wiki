### Cacodemon

Cacodemons are living horrors from the Outer Darkness brought to our world by black magic, evil prayer, or terrible suffering and calamity. Utterly alien and unspeakably vile, they have been known to mankind by many names: gremlin, incubus, demon, devil, fiend. Civilized adults, living in the safe realms of Law, may dismiss cacodemons as mere myths and legends, but the learned must endure the terror of knowing they are real.

Cacodemons range in power from chaotic spawn, no more fearsome than a gnoll, to archfiends capable of destroying dragons. Demonologists have codified this range into ten different **ranks**. Many of a cacodemon’s characteristics primarily depend on its rank. See the Cacodemon Characteristics by Rank tables, below.

The appearance of cacodemons varies as much as their power. Some occultists argue that cacodemons have no true body form, and that it is the summoner’s will which imposes shape upon their formless souls. Others argue that as creatures of Chaos, cacodemons come in every body form imaginable. Whatever the case, a cacodemon’s speed and attack routine are determined by its **body form**, while its damage is determined by the intersection of its rank and body form. See the Cacodemon Characteristics by Body Form table, below.

Cacodemons are **resistant** to acidic, cold, electrical, fire, poisonous, and seismic damage. They have **lightless vision** (90’) and possess **telepathy** (as the spell) allowing them to communicate with any creatures they encounter. In addition, all cacodemons have at least two other special abilities, one of them often derived from their body form. High-ranking cacodemons may have as many as five special abilities. Refer to the Cacodemon Characteristics by Rank table for the number of special abilities the cacodemon receives. Winged cacodemons lose one special ability to compensate for flight.

Some cacodemons are capable of speech. The higher the rank of the cacodemon, the greater the probability that it has the capability of speech. Refer to the Cacodemon Characteristics by Rank table for the probability of speech. All cacodemons that can speak know Common and two other languages.

Cacodemons that speak can also cast arcane spells at a caster level of ½ their HD. The arcane spells per day available is determined by the cacodemon’s rank. Cacodemons always know the same number of arcane spells that they can cast per day. Their repertoire is innate and they have no need for spell formula or studying.

Different cacodemons favor different types of spells, but enchantments such as *dark whispers, incite madness, infuriate beast, inspire horror,* and *enslave*are common.

Cacodemons that can speak and cast spells should be counted as having two additional special abilities (\*\*) for purposes of XP. (This is already factored into the HD entry and XP awards for Fiends and Archfiends, which always can speak and cast spells). If all cacodemons are unintelligent creatures incapable of speech in the Judge’s campaign setting, then cacodemons who would be capable of speech should gain an additional two special abilities instead. Cacodemons will not cast spells when conjured or summoned unless they are Fiends or Archfiends.

Whatever their special abilities, cacodemons are unholy beings that can be detected with *discern evil*, held at bay by *holy circle,* dispelled with *counterspell* or *dispel magic,* destroyed with *dispel evil,* and rebuked as infernals.

Cacodemons most often appear in one of five basic body forms, each of which has winged and wingless variants, for a total of ten common body form configurations. These are:

**Arachnine:**Arachnine cacodemons resemble giant spiders, with chitinous segmented eight-legged bodies, fanged chelicerae, web-making spinnerets, and up to eight insect-like eyes. Winged arachnine cacodemons add a pair of dragonfly-like wings. A wingless arachnine has an encounter speed of 60’. A winged arachnine has an encounter speed of 60’ and a flying encounter speed of 120’. In either case, arachnines can climb at their land encounter speed. An arachnine cacodemon’s attack routine consists of a bite attack. Arachnine cacodemons may select the **poison** special ability if desired.

**Humanoid:** Humanoid cacodemons are bipedal, two-armed, two-legged creatures. Some are beautiful and majestic, resembling elves, men, or gods. Others are hideous to behold, resembling minotaurs, ogres, owlbears, or worse. If wings are present, they sprout from the shoulder blades; they are typically bat-like, but feathered avian wings and membranous insect wings are also possible. A wingless humanoid has an encounter speed of 120’. A winged humanoid has a land encounter speed of 90’ and a flying encounter speed of 240’. A humanoid’s attack routine consists of a pair of claw attacks and a bite attacks. Some humanoids may instead have a weapon attack, which deals damage as an arachnine bite attack.

**Monadine:** Monadine cacodemons appear as amorphous blobs of cytoplasmic ichor, capable of changing their shape, forming stalks, and extruding pseudopods. Some monadine cacodemons may have blinking eyes, agonized human faces, or pulsating organs visible on or within their cytoplasm. Wingless monadine have a land encounter speed of 30’. Winged monadine, capable of propelling themselves into the air and forming their bodies into a wing-like surface, gain a flying encounter speed of 60’. In either case, monadine cacodemons can climb and swim at their land encounter speed. A monadine’s attack routine consists of an envelopment by an extruded pseudopod. Monadine cacodemons may select the **swallow attack** special ability if desired.

**Scolopendrine:**Scolopendrine cacodemons resemble enormous carcass scavengers, with long segmented bodies with a pair of legs on every segment, terminating in a head festered with elongated mandibles and eight tentacle-like antenna. Wingless scolopendrine have an encounter speed of 120’. Winged scolopendrine gain a pair of membranous wings on every segment, granting a flying encounter speed of 180’. A scolopendrine’s attack routine consists of eight tentacle attacks and a bite attack. Scolopendrine cacodemons may select the **paralysis** special ability if desired.

**Wyverine:** Wyverine cacodemons have bipedal body forms with two vestigial arms (like a tyrannosaur). If wings are present, they replace the arms (like a bat or bird). A wingless wyverine cacodemon has an encounter speed of 120’, while a winged wyvernine cacodemon has a land encounter speed of 90’ and a flying encounter speed of 240’. A wyvern’s attack routine consists of either a bite and a tail attack or two talon attacks. Winged wyvernine cacodemons may select the **dive attack** special ability while wingless ones may select the **berserk** special ability.

To randomly determine a cacodemon’s body form, roll 1d10. 1-2, Arachnine; 3-4, Humanoid; 5-6, Monadine; 7-8 Scolopendrine; 9-10, Wyverine. If the roll is odd, it is a winged version of that body form. If the roll is even, it is the wingless form.

###### Cacodemon Size, Mass, and Carrying Capacity

A cacodemon’s mass (in pounds) is determined by its HD and its body mass exponent, according to the formula *mass = (HD x 10)BME*. The cacodemon’s weight then determines its carrying capacity and size category. Its carrying capacity is calculated according to the formula *carrying capacity = mass x CCF*. Size category is shown on the table below.

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Mass | 35 lbs or less | 36 to 400 lbs | 401 to 2,000 lbs | 2,001 to 8,000 lbs | 8,001 to 32,000 lbs | More than 32,000 lbs |
| Size Category | Small | Man-Sized | Large | Huge | Gigantic | Colossal |
| Length/Height | Less than 2’ long/tall | Less than 8’ long/tall | 8’ to 12’ long/tall | 12’ to 20’ long/tall | 20’ to 32’ long/tall | 32’ or more long/tall |

A cacodemons’s size category determines its height and length. Wingspans of winged cacodemons will typically be three times length. Being magical creatures, cacodemons do not suffer an AC penalty for size category. Some cacodemons may be lighter and smaller than their HD and BME would indicate (Judge’s choice), but they may not be larger.

###### Cacodemon Special Abilities

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Usage | Usage Factor | Usage | Usage Factor |
| At will | 1 | 1/day | 0.4 |
| 1/turn | 0.8 | 1/week | 0.3 |
| 1/3 turns | 0.7 | 1/month | 0.2 |
| 1/hour | 0.6 | 1/season | 0.1 |
| 3/day | 0.5 | 1/year | 0.05 |

The Judge may roll or select powers for the cacodemon from the list below, or make up his own. An \* indicates the power is worth one special ability, while a # indicates it is worth 1/8 special ability. The Judge should continue to roll or choose powers until the appropriate total number is chosen.

Spell-like special abilities count as fractions of a special ability each. Multiply ¼ x the level of the spell-like ability by the usage factor shown on the adjoining table.

EXAMPLE: A particular cacodemon can cast *illusion* at will (4th level, usage 1), *command word* at will (1st level, usage 1), *mirror image* once per day (2nd level, usage 0.4), and *bewitch humanoid* once per day (1st level, usage 0.4). Its spell-like abilities count as [ (1/4 x 4 x 1) + (1/4 x 1 x 1) + (1/4 x 2 x 0.4) + (1/4 x 1 x 0.4) ] 1.55 abilities, rounded to 2.

If the creature is already cowering or faltering, it is frightened instead. Creatures with class level or HD equal to or greater than ½ the cacodemon’s HD are immune to the dread. |
| 17-18 | Enervation (\*\*): A character damaged by the cacodemon’s primary attack reduces his maximum hp by the amount of damage dealt and becomes enervated. |
| 19-20 | Enslave (\*): The cacodemon can enslave victims to its will 3/day or by gaze. The target must succeed on a Spells save or be enslaved to the cacodemon. If the cacodemon has 3 HD or less, the save is at +2. If the cacodemon has 9 HD or more, the save is at -2. |
| 21-23 | Flying (####): The cacodemon is capable of flying at the speed noted for its body form. If it already flies, it becomes capable of making dive attacks that deal double damage.

However, if an incorporeal cacodemon has 4 HD or less, it considers damage dealt by silver weapons to be extraordinary damage. It can select enervation and flying as special abilities. |
| 39 | Infectious (##): The cacodemon is able to transform its victims into others of its kind or a lesser kind. Creatures slain by the cacodemon might rise as cacodemons of its type unless appropriate measures are taken; or victims suffering loss of half or more of their hit points to the cacodemon’s natural attacks might become a cacodemon of its type after 2d6 days. |
| 40-41 | Invisibility (\*): The cacodemon is naturally invisible. It may act freely, including attacking, without becoming visible. |
| 42-43 | Lightning Reflexes (##): The cacodemon is extremely fast, and gains a +2 bonus to initiative. |

Roll 1d20 to determine onset time: 1-12, instant (at the end of the cacodemon’s initiative); 13-14, 1 turn; 15, 1d4 turns; 16-19 1d4+2 turns; 20, 1 d10 turns. Roll 1d20 to determine effect 1-16, death; 17-19: paralysis 2d4 turns + 1d6 damage per HD; 20: incapacitation. If the cacodemon has 3 HD or less, the save is at +2. If the cacodemon has 9 HD or more, the save is at -2. |
| 62-63 | Regeneration (\*): The cacodemon regenerates hit points each round, with the ability to re-attach lost limbs, unless the damage is of two particular types (usually fire and acid). The amount regenerated will be HD/2 per round. |

Aquatic mechanoreception is equal to its swimming encounter speed. |
| 70-71 | Spellcasting (\*\*): The cacodemon may cast spells as if it were a mage of the class level shown on the Cacodemon Primary Characteristics by Rank table. Re-roll if the cacodemon is already able to cast spells. |
| 72-75 | Spell-like Abilities (varies): The cacodemon gains 1d4 spell-like abilities. Generate the abilities as if rolling for spell scrolls or select appropriate abilities based on the cacodemon’s other powers (Judge’s choice). Each spell-like ability counts as a fraction of a special ability. Multiply 2 x spell level x the usage factor (see above). |
| 76-80 | Stealth (#): The cacodemon is difficult to notice. Characters encountering the cacodemon at any time suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls. |
| 81-83 | Swallow Attack (\*): The cacodemon can swallow whole victims two size categories smaller than itself on an unmodified attack throw of 20. A victim that is swallowed whole takes damage equal to the cacodemon’s HD each round until the cacodemon is killed or the victim dies. If the cacodemon is of gigantic size, it can swallow on 19-20; if of colossal size, on 18-20. If the cacodemon is not at least huge size, re-roll. |
| 84-86 | Swift (##): The cacodemon moves rapidly. Its speed is increased by 30’ for every 120’ of base encounter movement |
| 87-88 | Terrifying (\*): The cacodemon can cause panic and terror by taking a combat action. The area of effect is 100 square feet per HD. Each affected creature must succeed on a Paralysis save or become frightened. Creatures with class level or HD of ½ the cacodemon’s HD or less falter even if the save succeeds. |
| 89-91 | Topple and Fling (####): When the cacodemon hits with its primary attack, it can topple and fling creatures that are at least two size classes smaller than itself. The creature struck must make a size-adjusted Paralysis saving throw. If the save fails, the creature is knocked prone and forced back a number of feet equal to the damage dealt. If this would push the creature into a wall or other obstacle, the creature takes 1d6 {B} damage per 10’ he has traveled. If the cacodemon is not at least huge sized, re-roll. |
| 92-94 | Tough (varies): The cacodemon is unusually tough or hardy. Its AC is increased by 1d4 points. If this increases its AC to more than its HD x 1.5, this counts as a 1 special ability. Otherwise it counts as ¼ special ability. |
| 95-97 | Trample (##): The cacodemon gains a trample attack which it may use in lieu of its normal attack sequence. The trample attack should inflict an average of 2 hp of {B} damage per HD the cacodemon possesses. The cacodemon gains a +4 bonus to attack targets smaller than itself and can force back such creatures. If the cacodemon is not at least large sized, re-roll. |
| 98-99 | Vicious Attack (####): The cacodemon has a vicious attack. On an unmodified attack throw of 20, the creature struck by the attack must make a Death save. If the save succeeds, the creature suffers double damage. If the save fails, the creature suffers triple damage and has a limb broken. If the cacodemon is of gigantic size, it can dismember on 19-20; if of colossal size, on 18-20. If the cacodemon is not at least large sized, re-roll. |
| 100 | Unusual (\* or more): The cacodemon has a rare, unique, or special power determined by the Judge. If the Judge doesn’t have time to be creative, re-roll. |
