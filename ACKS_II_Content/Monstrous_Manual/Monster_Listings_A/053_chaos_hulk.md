### Chaos Hulk

Raw chaos given physical form, a chaos hulk is a roiling, shifting, twisting mass of tissues, constantly growing and reabsorbing limbs, mouths, eyes, and other organs of all varieties, natural and alien. Feathers, scales, skin, slime, carapace, bone, all these elements and more may appear on a hulk at any single moment, only to mutate again moment later.

###### Combat

Insane and unpredictable, a chaos hulk is by turns idiot and genius. Roll 1d20 on the following table at the start of the hulk’s initiative to determine its actions:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Experiences a round of lucidity, and can briefly converse with others. |
| 2 | Cackles and sways to unheard music. |
| 3 | Stands utterly motionless and unchanging. |
| 4 | Rants gibberish in tongues known and unknown. |
| 5 | Mews piteously, twitching and drooling. |
| 6 | Savagely attacks itself for the round. |
| 7 | Attempts to devour the nearest thing, living or dead, animate or inanimate. |
| 8 | Assaults the nearest shadow or inanimate object. |
| 9 | Screams terrible howls and roars and thrashes wildly. |
| 10 | Flees in a random direction at running speed. |
| 11+ | Moves to and attacks the nearest living things madly. |

A chaos hulk can make 1d6 attacks per combat action. Each successful attack deals 1d12 {N!}damage. Each creature damaged must make a Spells saving throw and a Death saving throw for **chaos infection** at the end of the hulk’s initiative.

If the Spells save fails, the creature is **mentally infected**. At the start of its initiative, it must roll on the hulk’s action table above to determine how it acts. At the end of its initiative, it makes another Spell save; succeeds ends the condition.

If the Death save fails, the creature is **physically infected** and becomes an undulating mass of flesh, muscle, and organs, gurgling and screaming in torment. The creature becomes **helpless** unless mentally infected. At the end of its initiative, it makes another Death save; success ends the condition.

Due to their ever-changing nature, chaos hulks regenerate 1d12 hit points at the start of their initiative each round. This same shifting renders them **immune** to enchantment and transmogrification effects. As Chaotic incarnations, they are inherently evil for the purposes of spells.

###### Ecology

Chaos spawn are manifestations of raw chaos without any natural habitat. They are found only when summoned or spawned in sinkholes of evil or by wild and chaotic magic.
