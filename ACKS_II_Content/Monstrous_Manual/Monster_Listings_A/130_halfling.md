### Halfling

Halflings are a race of diminutive and insular humanoids noted for their love of food, wealth, and comfort and their dislike of big people, strangers, and travel. Descending from human and dwarven stock, they stand about 3' tall and weigh about 40 - 50 lbs with ruddy skin, dark hair, and brown or black eyes. Among the most hirsute of the humanoid races, halflings cultivate their body hair the way dwarves cultivate their beards. Well-groomed foot hair is the mark of a halfling of fine breeding.

Halflings live in small, close-knit communities of hill burrows with big, round windows. These “halfling holes” are a compromise between a dwarven heritage that craves the security of thick earth overhead and a human bloodline clamoring for sun and space.

###### Combat

Halflings encountered outside a delving or shire will be bounders (1st level NPCs) traveling on official business. The bounders will be equipped with leather armor, shields, short swords, and slings.

The bounders will be **skilled warriors** with a +1 damage bonus. Due to **nervous watchfulness** they gain a +1 bonus to initiative and to avoid surprise. They are **naturally stealthy** and creatures encountering them suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls.

###### Ecology

Each halfling band will be led by a reeve with 2-2 HD and 7 hp. Each halfling meet will be led by a constable with 3-3 HD and 10 hp.

When halflings are encountered in a shire, they will be led by a steward with 5-5 HD, 15 hp, and a +2 damage bonus. As long as the steward is alive, the halflings will gain a +2 bonus to morale rolls. The shire will also be protected by a militia (0th level troops) equal to 200% of the number of halfling bounders. Halfling militia have Spd 60’, AC 2, 1d4 hp, and ML -1. They are usually equipped with leather armor, shield, short sword, and sling.

A shire will also be home to various halfling workers, noncombatants (adolescent, disabled, elderly, nursing, or pregnant) and juveniles, to a maximum 850%, 850%, and 1200% of the number of bounders respectively. Workers have Spd 90’, AC 0, 1d4 hp, ML -2, and are equipped with short swords. Noncombatants and juveniles have Spd 90’, AC 0, 1 hp, ML -4, and do not fight. The bounders and militia will fight to the death to defend the noncombatants and juveniles.

Halfling leaders should be assigned magic items using the ***ACKS II JJ***rules (p. XX).

###### Spoils

A slain or even captured halfling is worthless for monster components and all other purposes. They can still, however, be killed for sport.
