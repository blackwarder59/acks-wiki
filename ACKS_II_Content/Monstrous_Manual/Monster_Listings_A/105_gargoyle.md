### Gargoyle

Gargoyles are demonic magical constructs standing about 9’ tall and weighing about 1,500 lbs. A typical gargoyle has 15’ wide bat-like wings, two large horns, huge fangs, fearsome claws, and skin the color of gray stone. Like golems, gargoyles can only be created using mighty magic by exceptionally powerful spellcasters.

Although not as physically powerful as golems, gargoyles are more intelligent. During their manufacture, a bestial cacodemon spirit is grafted into the construct that provides them with the sly cunning of a lethal predator.

That same demonic spirit instills in the gargoyle a predator’s lust for blood and flesh, a lust that the gargoyle – being a construct of stone – can never satiate.

###### Combat

A stationary gargoyle perched on a stone building is **hard to differentiate** from a grotesque statue of the ordinary sort. Creatures encountering them in such environments suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls.

In combat, gargoyles can bite with their fangs (1d6 {P!}, gore with their horns (1d4 {P!}), and rake with each of their claws (1d3 {S!}).

Gargoyles are **immune** to enchantment effects, to poisonous damage, and to all mundane damage. As constructs, they count as enchanted creatures for purposes of spells such as *dispel evil*and *holy circle*.

###### Ecology

As constructs, gargoyles have no natural habitat. They can often be found guarding ancient treasures or serving powerful spellcasters. Other times they are driven by their demonic souls to roam dungeons or wildernesses in search of prey to satisfy their insatiable hunger.

###### Spoils

A destroyed gargoyle can be harvested with Magical Engineering for the following component:

* leering head (3 1/6 st, 190gp, *deflect ordinary weapons, winged flight*)

###### Lair

A limestone wall, overgrown with ivy and moss, is all that remains of a fort that once stood here. The wall rises some 15’ high and spans about 30’ in length before it crumbles into rubble. In lieu of battlements, the ancient builders constructed a series of grotesque statues that still leer down at passersby, remarkably intact. The statues are actually **five gargoyles**.

**Gargoyles (5):** Spd 90’ / 150’ fly, AC 4, HD 4\*\*, hp 22, 20, 19, 18, 14, #AT 4 (2 claws, bite, horn 7+), Dmg 1d3 {S!} /1d3 {S!} / 1d6 {P} / 1d4 {P}, Save F8, ML +3, XP 190

Amidst the rubble at the eastern edge of the wall are a number of skeletons, slain long ago in the siege that destroyed this place. One of the skeletons wears a carved jade ring (1,000gp).
