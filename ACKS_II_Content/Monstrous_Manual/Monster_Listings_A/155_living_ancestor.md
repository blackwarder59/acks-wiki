### Living Ancestor

When a dignified and prosperous dwarf passes, it is customary for his descendants to erect a larger-than-life statue in his memory. Such statutes are common sights in the grand galleries of the vaults of dwarves. Most of these statues are inert memorials to ancestors whose souls have passed on. But in some… the ancestor lives.

A living ancestor resembles a 6’ tall funerary statue, but it is actually a magical construct that carries within it the soul of the dwarf it memorializes. To become a living ancestor is an act of willing self-sacrifice, for the dwarf who allows the craftpriests to bind his lifeforce into the stone forgoes any hope of reincarnation or afterlife. Only the most powerful dwarves can survive the agonizing transformation, and only the most committed, desperate, or vengeful would dare it.

###### Combat

Every living ancestor was once a dwarf of at least 10th level. The living ancestor retains all of the class powers and proficiencies it had in life. It can also continue to advance after its transformation, gaining additional class powers and spells where applicable, using the rules for monstrous advancement (p. XX). For instance, a craftpriest who becomes a living ancestor and advances to 11 HD would gain 6th level spells and access to ritual magic.

Living ancestors can attack with a stone fist or with any weapon with which they are proficient. When striking with melee weapons, the living ancestor deals double damage dice and can add his class damage bonus (if any). When striking with his fist, the living ancestor deals 3d8 {B!} damage, but does not get his class damage bonus.

Living ancestors are **immune** to enchantment effects, necrotic damage, poisonous damage, and all mundane damage. They are **resistant** to extraordinary cold, electric, fire, piercing, and slashing damage. They also benefit from **magic resistance** to spells and spell-like effects. When a living ancestor is affected by a spell or spell-like effect, it can (but does not have to) make a magic resistance throw with a +3 bonus. If the result of the throw equals or exceeds the caster level of the spell or spell-like effect, the living ancestor ignores it. As constructs, living ancestors count as enchanted creatures for purposes of spells such as *dispel evil*and *holy circle*.

###### Ecology

A mere soul is not enough to move a quarter-ton of rock. In order to remain animate, a living ancestor must receive 1,200 divine power from the congregation of a craftpriest each week. If, for whatever reason, the living ancestor does not receive the needed divine power, it begins to slow down. Each week that passes without sufficient divine power, the living ancestor reduces its exploration speed by 10’. When its exploration speed is reduced to 0’, the living ancestor becomes inert and **paralyzed**. An inert living ancestor enters a hibernation and no longer needs divine power. A slowed or inert living ancestor can be restored to mobility by paying additional divine power. For instance, a living ancestor that had no divine power for 10 weeks would need 1,200 divine power to gain 10’ speed and 7,2000 to gain its full mobility in addition to the ordinary 1,200 per week.
