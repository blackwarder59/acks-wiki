### Centaur

The origin of the race of centaurs is unknown. Though evidently a form of beastman, they appear in the earliest elven annals still known to sages. Whatever their origin, they are noble creatures with the torsos, arms, and heads of humans and the bodies and legs of horses. Most centaurs in Aurëpos have light olive skin and brown hair and hide, but like the horses and humans they were bred from they can vary wildly in build and coloration. They weigh around 2,100 lbs.

Centaurs combine the skittishness of horses and with the tribalism of humans. As a result, they are quite reclusive, preferring to live far from other races in densely woodlands.

Centaurs speak their own language, which seems to be closely related to Argollëan (Elven). Chieftains and shamans also speak Argollëan, Faerie, and 1d4 other languages.

###### Combat

Centaurs avoid conflict where possible, but the stallions will fight to guard their communities while the mares and foals escape. Centaurs attack by kicking with their two forelegs and striking with a weapon. Their **thick hides** grant a +2 AC bonus.

When armed for battle, they typically wear leather armor (for a final AC of 4) and carry oaken clubs and composite bows.

###### Ecology

Each centaur troop will be led by a chieftain in plate armor with 6 AC, 5 HD, 29 hp, and a +2 damage bonus. A chieftain has a 50% chance of possessing Shaman abilities at level 1d6. As long as the chieftain is alive, the centaurs will gain a +2 bonus to morale rolls.

Centaur lairs will have mares and foals equal to 100% and 200% of the number of stallions. Centaurs mares have AC 2, Spd 180’, HD 3, and attack with 2 hooves (1d4 {B}). Centaur foals have AC 1, HD 2, and attack with 2 hooves (1d2 {B}). Neither mares nor foals use weapons.

###### Spoils

A slain centaur stallion can be harvested with Healing for the following components useful in magic research:

* hooves (1 2/6 st., 80gp, *call of the galloping herd, safe travels, swift sword, vigor*)

A slain centaur mare can be harvested for components worth and weighing 40% less (5/6 st, 50gp).

###### Lore

*The Battle of Garupesh could have been won had the Somireans been better versed in military history. The tactics that the Argollëans used to conquer the centaur horse archers of the Istrith would have ably served against the Skysos.*

* Harbitus Kyr, *The Great Skysos War*
