### Leyak

Born from a Somirean cult of wicked sorceresses whose attempt to gain immortality went awry, leyak appear as nothing more than normal human women during the hours of daylight—but when night falls, they can detach their heads from their bodies and take to the air, glistening entrails trailing from the neck and eyes glowing green. While the hollow body lies prostrate, the leyak prowls the night in search of nourishment. They prefer the flesh and blood of infants and children, but will settle for older prey or even corpses if fresher provender is unavailable or too dangerous to obtain.

Clever and patient, they will bide their time and avoid fair confrontations, and strive to avoid discovery. They are keenly aware that if their headless and helpless body is slain or if they fail to re-join by daybreak, they will die.

When a woman becomes a leyak, she loses the ability to birth children. To increase their numbers, the leyak actively seek out promising evil sorceresses to join their ranks, offering them endless youth and terrible power. Those who agree are transformed into leyak in a foul ritual involving the ingestion of leyak flesh and blood.

Leyak speak whatever languages they knew in life.

###### Combat

Every leyak retains the **spellcasting** abilities she possessed as a mortal sorceress. Most leyak are 6th level mages but some ancient leyak are even some are older and more powerful.

As flying heads, leyak have a **horrific** **visage**. When a creature first beholds one or more leyaks, and at the start of each round thereafter that it continues to do so, the creature must make a Paralysis saving throw. The save suffers a -1 penalty per additional leyak after the first. If the save fails, the creature is **cowering** until the start of the next round. If the save succeeds, the creature gains immunity to the effects of every leyak’s horrific visage for 1 turn.

A leyak attacks by lashing out with a long proboscis-like tongue. If a leyak damages a target with its bite, the leyak latches onto it and begins **draining blood**. Thereafter the leyak can use its combat action to automatically deal another 1d4 necrotic damage to the creature each round.

Creatures that are having their blood drained by a leyak can still move, but count as carrying 2 extra stone of encumbrance. The leyak moves with the creature from which it is drinking blood. A creature can only escape or be freed from the leyak by killing the leyak or severing the tongue.

To cut the tongue, a creature must deal 8 or more slashing damage to it in one blow. (Any damage dealt beyond 8 points is not dealt to the leyak.) If the tongue is severed, the leyak can no longer make tongue attacks that night, but it will regenerate the tongue by the following eve.

Despite being ageless blood-drinking fiends, leyak are monstrosities, not undead. However, they are considered enchanted and can be kept at bay by *holy circle*and destroyed or driven off by *dispel evil.*

###### Ecology

Leyak can be found everywhere there are infants and children for them to feed upon. Often they will pretend to be itinerant entertainers or priestesses. They tend not to settle in one place for long, as their depredations eventually draw suspicion from the local residents. Leyak are usually encountered alone while hunting for prey, but they make their lairs with others of their kind.

###### Spoils

A slain leyak can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the following components useful in magic research:

* blood (5 5/6 st, 350gp, *trollblood, youthfulness*)
* entrails (4 st, 240gp, any death or necromancy effect)
* eyes (4 st, 240gp, *cone of fear, frighten crowd, inspire horror, panic*)
* tongue (4 st, 240gp, *life transfer, telekinesis, tongues*)

###### Encounter

Nestled in a clearing is a shrine to Dahag, the Somirean god of death (Dirgion to the Aurans). Constructed of dark grey andesite rock, the 15’ x 15’ shrine stands on a 3.5’ high base. Its north, west, and east sides are adorned with high-relief sculptures of rakshasa and yali doing battle. On its south side, a stairway ascends upward through a 5’ x 5’ corbelled chamber to access a door into the interior of the shrine. Above, a five-stepped roof soars to 20’, its pinnacle a star of black iron. Inside, a stone-lined pit, 5’ square and 20’ deep, occupies the center of the shrine’s interior.

At the bottom of the pit lies a pile of earth, charcoal, and burned bones. The west and east walls of the interior are adorned with funerary prayers and rites of preparation for death. The north wall is carved with a high-relief sculpture of Dahag. The whole shrine is a shadowed sinkhole of evil (see p. XX).

The shrine receives offerings daily, brought by parents hoping Dahag will spare their progeny from a deadly sickness that plagues this region. These offerings are collected by the shrine’s caretakers, three middle-aged women, who offer prayers for protection from death on behalf of the donors.

Such prayers are quite efficacious, but not because the caretakers have any clerical power. They are actually a coven of **three** **leyak**, and the deadly illness is caused by their nocturnal feeding. The leyak never feed on their donors, however, sustaining the illusion that “donations to Dahag” are rewarded.

**Leyak (3):** Spd 120’/120’ fly, AC 2/5, HD 6\*\*\*, hp 44, 29, 25, #AT 1 (tongue 5+), Dmg 1d4 {P!} + blood drain, Save M6, AL C; Special: blood drain (1d4 ongoing, deal 8hp in one blow to cut off), horrific (Paralysis save or cowed); Spells: 2 1st, 2 2nd, 2 3rd; Repertoire: 1st – *choking grip, summon manes*, 2nd – *invisibility, necromantic potence,* 3rd – *dismember, earth’s teeth*

The strongest of the leyaks (44hp) carries an ornamental katar (*dagger +1*) and carries a pair of gourds with coffee-colored broth (*potions of human control*). The rest of the trio’s treasure is kept in an ironbound casket hidden amidst the burned bones at the base of the pit.

Within are 2,000gp, 800 electrum plates (5gp each, 1 st per 100 plates), 120 lammasu feathers (8gp each, 1 st per 12 feathers), 10 pieces of ivory (40gp each, 1 st per 100gp), 8 seashells carved with religious iconography (120gp each), 12 tiny jade turtles (200gp each), and 4 alabaster figurines of Dahaga (300gp each). In addition, each creatures’ blood (350gp, 5 5/6 st), entrails (240gp, 4 st), eyes (240gp, 4 st), and tongue (240gp, 4 st) can be harvested as special components.
