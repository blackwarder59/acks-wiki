### Hydra

Hydras are vicious semi-sapient monstrosities with up to 12 heads. They have skin shaded gray-brown to dark brown, with a light yellow or tan underbelly, eyes of amber, and yellow-white teeth. An average hydra is 20' long and weighs about 3,400 to 4,800 lbs, depending on its heads.

###### Combat

When a hydra is encountered, it will have 1d8+4 heads. A hydra with less than 12 heads will have cauterized stumps visible where the missing heads used to be.

Hydras have a number of Hit Die equal to their current number of heads, with maximum hit points on each Hit Die. A hydra saves as a fighter equal in level to the hydra’s Hit Dice. Each head can bite an opponent each round, so the number of attacks a hydra has each round is equal to the number of heads it has.

When a hydra suffers 8 damage, one head is destroyed. For each additional 8 damage, another head is destroyed. When all heads have been destroyed, the hydra dies. Destroying one of a hydra’s heads does not trigger a cleave.

However, a hydra’s destroyed heads can quickly **regenerate**. At the end of its next initiative, a hydra that has lost one or more heads in the preceding round will grow 2 new heads for each lost head, subject to a maximum possible 12 heads. Heads destroyed by fire damage do not regenerate. Heads destroyed by other damage can be prevented from regenerating by **cauterizing** the stumps with fire or acid before they re-grow. Cauterizing a stump is a combat action that requires a successful attack throw against the hydra at a -4 penalty to work. A character cannot cleave after cauterizing. Each cauterized stump reduces the hydra’s maximum heads.

###### Ecology

Hydra are found in bogs, marshes, swamps, and other wetlands. They are solitary creatures, always dwelling alone. They reproduce by budding: every two decades, a tubular outgrowth or “bud” begins to develop on the hydra’s body. The bud develops into a tiny version of the adult hydra with multiple tiny heads and limbs. When encountered, a hydra has a 5% chance to have a bud visibly growing on it.

After about a year, the bud detaches, becoming a hydralet (baby hydra). Hydralets quickly leave the lair to avoid being cannibalized by their parent.

###### Spoils

A slain hydra can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the following components useful in magic research:

* blood (11 4/6 st, 700gp, *cure injury, longevity, trollblood, water breathing*)
* scales (11 4/6 st, 700gp, *repair disability & disfigurement, restore life & limb*)
* set of skulls (11 4/6 st,700gp, *swift strike*)
