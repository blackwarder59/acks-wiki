### Jellyfish, Giant

The giant jellyfish has a bell-shaped body some 7’ in diameter with a maw-like mouth on the underside surrounded by thousands of hair-like tentacles festering with venomous stingers. The tentacles trail behind the jellyfish to a colossal length of up to 120’. Despite its length, the jellyfish weighs only about 800 lbs.

###### Combat

Giant jellyfish have **translucent bodies** that make them hard to spot. Creatures encountering them suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls. The creatures “see” by means of light-sensitive eye spots spread across their bodies, equivalent to **lightless vision**.

On its initiative, a jellyfish will use a full-round action to drift above the nearest visible prey. As it moves, its tentacles trail behind it to form a watery column 7’ in diameter and 120’ long. Any creature that starts its initiative in the tentacle column, or enters the tentacle column on its initiative, is **engulfed.**

When it becomes engulfed, and at the start of its initiative thereafter while it remains engulfed, the engulfed creature must make a Paralysis saving throw. If the saving throw succeeds, the creature suffers 1 {A} damage but is otherwise not harmed. If the saving throw fails, the creature suffers 1 {A} damage and becomes **paralyzed** by the venom until the start of its next initiative. If the creature is unable to breath water, it also begins **drowning**.

If a jellyfish has engulfed and paralyzed one or more tiny creatures, it can consume the creatures as a full-round action. Consumed creatures are instantly slain.

Giant jellyfish are **immune** to enchantment effects and poisonous damage. An attack targeting a jellyfish’s column of tentacles, rather than its body, can never deal more than 1 damage to the jellyfish unless the attack has an area of effect. An attack targeting its body deals normal damage.

###### Ecology

Giant jellyfish ceaselessly drift through the ocean depths, consuming whatever hapless sea creatures are stunned by its venom. They do not establish nests or exhibit any parental care for their offspring. They rely on pelagic spawning, in which the female releases her eggs into the water column and the male externally fertilizes them. The eggs then hatch into larva (babies), which attach themselves to substrates and become polyps (juveniles), which bud to create more of their own kind. The polyps resemble sessile anemones and corals and do not become recognizable as jellyfish until they reach sexual maturity.

Since jellyfish drifty without ever nesting, the lair roll actually determines whether the jellyfish swims alone or in a bloom of other jellyfish. If a vessel encounters a bloom of giant jellyfish, all fishing attempts automatically fail until the next day, as the edible fish have been devoured or driven off by the jellyfish.
