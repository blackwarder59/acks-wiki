### Death Charger

Death chargers are undead cavalry created by necromantically bonding and stitching the upper body of a zombie-like humanoid to the back of a re-animated warhorse. In effect, this creates a fearless, unquestioning cavalryman who cannot be forcibly dismounted and acts in silent unison with his mount. Even though slowed by zombification, death chargers can manage as much speed as a heavier warhorse and never need food or rest.

Like skeletons and zombies, death chargers have only the dimmest flicker of sapience. Any instructions given to a death charger by its creator or controller must be very simple. In the absence of orders or opponents, death chargers stand still as death.

###### Combat

Unless under another’s control, death chargers are automatically Hostile to any living creature they encounter. They will always charge if possible.

Death chargers can attack twice with their hooves and once with their melee weapon. They are generally equipped with shield, sword, and lance (with which they deal double damage on a charge). Some death chargers might be further protected by armor. A death charger wearing armor adds the AC bonus to its base AC of 4.

Like all undead, death chargers are immune to enchantment effects, necrotic damage, and poisonous damage. They are inherently evil for purposes of *discern evil*and *holy circle*spells. Death chargers are rebuked as wraiths.

###### Ecology

As undead constructs, death chargers have no natural habitat. They are usually found serving powerful necromancers or lingering in the abandoned ruins of ancient and evil civilizations.

###### Spoils

A destroyed death charger can be harvested with Healing 2 for the following components useful in magic research:

* human skull (4/6 st, 45gp, *deathless minion, unliving puppet*)
* human humerus (4/6 st, 40gp, *striking*)
* hooves (4/6 st, 40gp, *vigor*)

###### Encounter

The burned-out remains of an Auran fort lay like a black scar atop a nearby hill. The wooden stockade that once encircled the fort is charred and broken along half its length, and reduced to ash along the remainder. Past the stockade are a number of blackened husks, scorched frames and burned foundations, all neatly arranged in the customary pattern of an Imperial fort. Only one structure remains intact: a cavalry stable-barracks, 200’ long and 50’ wide, made of whitewashed limestone, with a 15’ high red-tiled roof. At one time the stable-barracks garrisoned sixty men and horses, but now it is occupied by **eight death chargers**. The death chargers were created from the burned corpses of soldiers and mounts that died in the fire, and are truly hideous to behold.
