### Dwarf

Dwarves are short, stout demi-humans that average 4' tall but weigh as much as adult humans. Their skin can be very dark, but it is always some shade of tan or brown. Hair color can be black, gray, or brown. Dwarves favor earth tones in their clothing and prefer simple and functional garb.

They dwell in forbidding mountain ranges such as the Meniri and Jutting Mountains, where they carve great vaults from the living rock. Tunnels connect the vault to the mines, mushroom farms, and terraces wherein the dwarves toil.

###### Combat

Dwarves encountered outside a vault will be squads or companies of sentries (1st level vaultguards) on a mission or warrior pilgrimage. 50% of the sentries will be equipped with spears, hand axes, shields, and banded plate, while 50% will be crossbowmen equipped with arbalest, hand axe, and chain. All of the sentries will be **skilled warriors** who gain a +1 damage bonus.

Dwarven sentries will generally be intent on accomplishing whatever mission has brought them out of their vault. However, they revile goblins with such hatred that they will automatically have Hostile reactions to any encountered.

###### Ecology

Each squad will be led by a 2nd level vaultguard. Each company will be led by a 4th level vaultguard assisted by 2 3rd level vaultguards.

When dwarves are encountered in a vault, it will be led a dwarven vaultguard of level 5+1d4. As long as the chief is alive, the dwarves will gain a +2 bonus to morale rolls. There is a 50% chance the vault will be ministered to by a dwarven craftpriest of level 5+1d4 and a 60% chance the vault will be protected by trained animals, either 5d4 war dogs or 2d4 brown bears.

A newly-established vault will typically have few or no other residents, but in a long-established vault, additional dwarves will be present. In addition to the vaultguard companies, the vault will be protected by a militia (0th level troops) of up to 200% of the number of dwarven vaultguards. Dwarven militia have Sped 90’, AC 5, 1-1 HD, and ML 0. They are usually equipped with chain mail, shield, and war hammer or battle axe.

A long-established vault will also be home to various dwarven workers, noncombatants (adolescent, disabled, elderly, nursing, or pregnant), and juveniles up to a maximum of 850%, 850% and 1200% of the number of vaultguards respectively. Workers have Spd 120’, AC 0, 1d4 hp, ML -2, and are equipped with hand axes. Noncombatants and juveniles have Spd 90’, AC 0, 1 hp, ML -4, and do not fight. The vaultguards and militia will fight to the death to defend the noncombatants and juveniles.

Dwarven leaders should be assigned magic items using the ***ACKS II JJ***rules (p. XX).
