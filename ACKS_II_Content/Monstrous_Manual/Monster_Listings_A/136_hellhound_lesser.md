### Hellhound, Lesser

Lesser hellhounds are cunning and vicious canines standing 3’ at the shoulder and weighing about 300 – 350 lbs. Their coats are red or red-brown while their eyes are blood red and smolder like coals. Iskara, mother of monsters, bred the first of their kind by infusing efreet ichor into the bodies of wolves.

Although not as intelligent as humans or greater hell hounds, lesser hellhounds are still sapient creatures. They can speak the barking, baying language of hellhounds as well as the language(s) of any local beastmen and fire giants.

###### Combat

Like the wolves they were bred from, lesser hellhounds have **acute hearing** and **acute olfaction.** They gain a +2 bonus to avoid surprise in their natural habitat. They can track the scent of creatures for up to 4 miles with the equivalent of two ranks of Tracking proficiency. Their keen senses enable them to **discern invisible** creatures and features within 60’.

In combat, lesser hellhounds can either bite or breathe fire. The bite of a lesser hellhound deals 1d6 {F!} {P!} damage. The **fiery breath** of a lesser hellhound can affect one target within 15’. The affected creature must make a Blast saving throw. If the save fails, the creature suffers 3d6 {F!} fire damage. If the save succeeds, the creature suffers half that damage.

Lesser hellhounds are **immune** to mundane fire damage and **resistant** to extraordinary fire damage.

###### Ecology

Because of the efreeti ichor that courses through their veins, hellhounds delight in hot volcanic environments, especially places of power affiliated with the Elemental Sphere of Fire.

When greater hell hounds are encountered in a wilderness den, the hellhounds will be rearing 2d3 juveniles and 1d3 babies. Juvenile hellhounds have AC 3, Spd 90’, HD 1+2, and attack with a bite (1d3 {P}). Baby hellhounds have AC 2, Spd 90’, HD 1, and attack with 1 bite (1 {P}). Hellhounds do not breathe fire until they reach sexual maturity.

###### Spoils

A slain lesser hellhound can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the following components useful in magic research:

* teeth (3/6 st., 35gp, *fan of flames, energy protection (fire)*)
* tongue (3/6 st, 30gp, *discern invisible, summon hell hounds*)
