### Death Knight

For centuries, the Zaharans interred their mummified lords in peaceful *torpor* to await the Awakening. In the closing days of the Empyrean War, it became clear that this stately tradition was under terrible threat. When great Suhgurim, prince of ruinguards, was felled at the fields of Morgot by his half-brother Valerian, even the sorcerer-king Sebek was forced to admit that defeat was at hand. Violating a millennium of tradition, Sebek ordered that Suhgurim and his other fallen ruinguards be raised as fearsome undead of a type never created before or since: death knights. To be made a death knight was to be doomed to an eternity of suffering. Bound forever into irremovable plate armor, denied all the pleasures of life, the death knights were also forbidden the peace of *torpor*. Instead, they were sent straight back onto the battlefields, undead juggernauts whose hatred for their own horrific existence was matched only by their enmity for the Empyrean crusaders who had destroyed their birthright.

The *Fourth Book of the Empyrean War,* part of the *Seven Radiant Scrolls,* claims that all of the death knights were destroyed when Zahar was sacked. But the realm of Zahar was vast and its necromancy mighty …

###### Combat

All death knights have a **horrific** **visage**. When a creature first beholds one or more undead with this power, and at the start of each round thereafter that it continues to do so, the creature must make a Paralysis saving throw. The save suffers a -1 penalty per additional horrifying undead after the first. If the save fails, the creature is **cowering** until the start of the next round. If the save succeeds, the creature gains immunity to the effects of every undead’s horrific visage for 1 turn.

Every death knight was once a 12th level Zaharan Ruinguard. It possess all the class powers and proficiencies it had in life. However, these powers are magnified by its undead status. Anytime a death knight uses its **arcane striking** power, all of the damage dealt by the arcane strike becomes **enervating**, such that it permanently reduces the target’s maximum hp by the amount of damage dealt.

If the creature’s hp are reduced to 0, the creature is slain. If not slain, the creature becomes **enervated**.If a creature is slain by the enervating touch or enervated condition, it cannot be restored to life save by ritual magic*.* One day after the creature dies, it manifests as a **haunt** somewhere within 300’ of where it died (see p. XX).

The death knight’s irremovable armor grants it a 15 AC and makes it **immune** to enchantment effects, to necrotic and poisonous damage, and to all mundane damage. It is **resistant** to extraordinary bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. As undead, death knights are inherently evil for purposes of *discern evil*and *holy circle*spells. They are rebuked as vampires, but can make a Spells saving throw to resist the effects.

###### Ecology

Death knight are typically served by lesser undead, including 1d12 skeletal slayers and either 4d6 zombies or 3d10 skeletons.
