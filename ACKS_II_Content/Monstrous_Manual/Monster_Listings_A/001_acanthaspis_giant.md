### Acanthaspis, Giant

The giant acanthaspis, also known as the giant assassin bug, is a horrific predator with a taste for fresh meat. When full grown, it measures about 10' long and weighs about 800 lbs, with six legs and a short segmented beak. The beak injects acidic enzymes into the bug’s victims, digesting them from the inside so their liquified innards can be sucked out like milk.

###### Combat

After killing a victim, the acanthaspis secures the corpse on its glossy black carapace with sticky secretions, wearing its victims as **corpse** **armor.** When first encountered, an acanthaspis will have secured 2d10 corpses to itself. Each corpse can absorb 1hp of damage before being destroyed. It takes 1 turn for an acanthaspis to secure a new corpse to itself.

When an acanthaspis successfully bites a creature, the creature struck must make a Paralysis saving throw. If the save succeeds, the attack deals 3d6 {P!} damage but has no other effect. If the save fails, the attack deals 3d6 {P!} damage and the creature is **grabbed**. The acanthaspis immediately injects the grabbed creature with digestive enzymes that deal 1d4 {A!} damage. While the creature remains grabbed, the acanthaspis can use its combat action to automatically deal another 1d4 {A!} damage to the creature each round. Once the acidic damage reduces the grabbed creature to 0 or fewer hp, the acanthaspis immediately sucks out its melted innards, killing it instantly.

If desperate or frustrated, an acanthaspis can spew a 30’ x 5’ line of **acidic spit**. Any creature in the area of effect must make a Blast saving throw. If the save fails, the creature takes 4d8 {A!} damage. If the save succeeds, it takes half that damage. One such attack depletes the acanthaspis’s acid supply for 6 hours, so it will only spit acid when reduced to fewer than half its hit points or when it has failed to grab an opponent.

###### Ecology

When acanthaspis are encountered in a wilderness nest, there is a 25% chance per creature that it will have 1d4 eggs buried nearby. Acanthaspis eggs have 1 hp and weigh 4/6 st. Acanthaspis nymphs are rarely found in nests, because the nymphs immediately disperse into the wild after they emerge from their eggs.

###### Spoils

A slain acanthaspis can be harvested with Animal Husbandry 2 for the following components useful in magic research:

* acid gland (4 2/6 st, 260gp, *rain of vitriol, vitriolic infusion*)
* antennae (2 st, 120gp, *locate animal/plant, locate object*)
* mandible (2 st, 120gp, *choking grip, halt humanoid*)

If not used for magic research, an acanthaspis’s mandibles fetch 18gp and weigh 2/6 st. Its armored hide fetches 80gp and weighs 2 1/6 st.
