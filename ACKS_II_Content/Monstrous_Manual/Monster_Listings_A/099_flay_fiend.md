### Flay Fiend

A flay fiend is a horrific undead creature created by painstakingly removing the intact skin from a humanoid creature and then animating it with necromantic energies. Most necromancers use skin from a fresh corpse to create their flay fiends, but in Ancient Zahar the skin was harvested from still-living victims. The priestesses of Nasga considered it a sublime art to flay a comely captive in such a way as to maximize the victim’s agony while preserving the skin’s beauty.

Flay fiends have only the barest flicker of sapience so any instructions given to a skeleton by its creator or controller must be very simple. In the absence of orders or opponents, flay fiends remain stationary, as if they were curtains or carpets.

###### Combat

A flay fiend moves like a slug with an undulating crawl. It attacks by engulfing its target, slowly crushing and suffocating it. The victim's struggles clearly visible within the thin skin.

Because it envelopes its target in its voluminous skin, a flay fiend can ignore the target’s AC from armor (but not AC from DEX, magic items, natural armor, or spells) when it attacks. If its attack succeeds, the target suffers 1d4 {B!}damage and becomes **grabbed** (p. XX). Thereafter the flay fiend can use its combat action to automatically constrict the grabbed target for another 1d4 {B!}damage. If the flay fiend constricts a creature that requires respiration for 5 consecutive rounds, the creature dies of suffocation. Once it begins constricting a target, a flay fiend will continue to constrict it until the target dies or the flay fiend is destroyed or ordered by its controller to stop. Any damage dealt to a flay fiend that has grabbed a creature is divided evenly between it and the grabbed creature.

Like all undead, flay fiends are **immune** to enchantment effects, necrotic damage, and poisonous damage. Because of their malleable, yielding form, flay fiends are also **resistant** to arcane, bludgeoning, and seismic damage. They are inherently evil for purposes of *discern evil*and *holy circle*spells and can be rebuked as zombies.

###### Ecology

Flay fiends are generally found only in the lairs or former lairs of powerful necromancers or in ancient ruins dating to Thrassian or Zaharan times.

###### Spoils

A destroyed flay fiend can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the following components useful in magic research:

* skin sack (2/6 st., 19gp, *choking grip, circle of agony, physical protection (bludgeoning)*)
