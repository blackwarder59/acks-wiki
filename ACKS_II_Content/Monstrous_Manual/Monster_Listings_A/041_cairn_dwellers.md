### Cairn Dwellers

Pot-bellied, pasty-faced humanoids with six-fingered hands and dull, flat nails, cairn dwellers are the remnants of a ruined legion that invaded Cybele long before the Day Without Night.

They hail from a foreign Sphere of Existence ruled by a cacodemon archfiend named Y’chal, The Echoing Lord, which sees itself as a great god-conqueror. To guarantee the victory of its invading legion, Y’chal blessed the cairn dwellers with immortal invulnerability. Whether it be burned to the bone, chopped into pieces or torn limb from limb, a cairn dweller simply cannot die.

Defeated and broken in long-forgotten battles, the cairn dwellers have come to fear the agony of their unceasing lives more than anything else. Now they try to trick the gods of Cybele into letting them them die so their souls can be reformed into new life. To this end, they take up residence in tumuli and barrows, leaving only to feed and to find material for the crude copies they make of the grave goods they discover within their sepulchral homes - false offerings they hope will please their unhearing saviors.

When not arranging and rearranging their worthless cult-objects - losing track of the real treasures amid their false ones - they often lay in the sarcophagus of the honored dead, draping themselves in burial shrouds or wearing the waxen death masks of the those whose resting places they defile.

Nearly every cairn dweller is both cowardly and insane.

###### Combat

All cairn dwellers are protected by permanent *necromantic invulnerability* (as the spell). In addition, cairn dwellers are immune to necrotic and poison damage and cannot be coup de graced. Thus, the only means to actually destroy one is a *disintegration* spell or ritual magic.

Cairn dwellers tend to wear strange cobbled-together armor that shields their faces, necks, and limbs, while leaving their torso and abdomens exposed. They equip themselves with whatever hand weapons they find as grave goods.

###### Ecology

Each cell will be led by a champion with 3 AC, 3 HD, 16 hp, and a +2 damage bonus. Each cohort will be led by a sub-commander with 4 AC, 4 HD, 20 hp, and a +2 damage bonus. A crypt or cairn will be led by a commander with 5 AC, 6 HD, 28 hp, and a +3 damage bonus.

Cairn dweller leaders usually suffer from gruesome disabilities. Roll 1d20+5 and 1d6 on the Mortal Wounds (Savage) table for each leader and apply those effects to it.

Cairn dwellers sometimes are armed with potent treasures found in their blasphemous dwellings. Leaders should also be assigned magic items by HD using the ***ACKS II JJ***rules (p. XX). The most dangerous few still possess the weapon they brought with them millennia ago — the thunder-lance. This whisker-thin rod of devastating power functions as a *wand of thunderbolts,* but possess only 1d4 charges remaining and no means of recharging. 10% of sub-commanders and 25% of commanders are armed with a thunder-lance.
