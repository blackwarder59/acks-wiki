### Devil Ray, Giant

The giant devil ray is an enormous sea ray with wings that span around 15’ and a body that weighs up to 3,500 lbs. Their name derives from their cephalic fins, which resemble two horn-like structures in their heads, which lend the creature a sinister aspect. The ray’s long spiny tail, which ends in a venomous stinger, furthers the impression of devilishness. However, despite their appearance, giant devil rays are peaceful, curious creatures that are considerably smarter than most fish.

###### Combat

Humans and demi-humans swimming in water gain a +1 reaction roll bonus whenever they encounter these inquisitive creatures.

Rays are peaceful and deter predation by their size and speed. If forced to fight they attack with their **venomous sting**. Any creature damaged by a devil ray’s sting must make a Death save. If the save fails, the creature suffers 1d6 {Po}damage and becomes **queasy** from pain and nausea for 8 hours or until the poison is neutralized.

Giant devil rays have **natural camouflage** that make them hard to spot. Creatures encountering them suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls.

They are **prodigious leapers**; a devil ray that charges on its initiative can jump up to 15’ vertically and horizontally out of the water at any point in its movement.

###### Ecology

Since rays do not make nests, the lair roll actually determines whether the ray swims alone or in a fever of other rays.

Lifespan 26 years

###### Spoils

A slain giant devil ray can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following component useful in magic research:

* cephalic fins (2 st., 120gp, *leaping, swimming*)
* spiny tail (3 1/6 st., 200gp, *cause injury, neutralize poison, poison*)

Giant rays are smart and friendly enough to be tamed and trained. Such a practice is not common among the humans and demi-humans of the Ammas Aurë, but adventurers who have delved its deep waters claim that some tritons use rays as aquatic mounts.
