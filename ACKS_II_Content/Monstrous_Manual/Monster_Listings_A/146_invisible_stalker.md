### Invisible Stalker

Invisible stalkers are incarnations from the Elemental Sphere of Air. They rarely appear on Aurëpos, save when summoned by powerful mages to serve them.

Compelled by magic, a summoned invisible stalker will undertake whatever task its summoner commands, even if it sends it hundreds or thousands of miles away. Like most incarnations, of course, invisible stalkers resent protracted missions or complex tasks and will seek to pervert their instructions to ease the burden of service.

###### Combat

Invisible stalkers are naturally **invisible.** They can act freely, including attacking, without becoming visible. However, the spell *discern invisibility* will reveal its presence.

They are **proficient searchers**, capable of finding hidden features as 8th level thieves (9+) and can **track** with great skill (3 ranks).

Thrice per day, they can use *passageway* as a **spell-like ability** to pass through walls and other structures. No mere physical obstacle can stop an invisible stalker from pursuing its mission!

However, as incarnations, invisible stalkers can be held at bay by *holy circle* anddispelled with *counterspell* or *dispel magic.*

###### Ecology

Invisible stalkers appear on Aurëpos when called forth by a spell or aerie of elemental air. Nothing is known of their habitat on the Elemental Sphere of Air.

###### Spoils

A destroyed invisible stalker can be harvested with Alchemy 2 for the following component:

* clear ichor (18 2/6 st, 1,100gp, *invisibility, locate object, passageway, undetectability*)

###### Lore

*Behind three walls, the sheik sits uneasy; behind four walls, the sheik reigns secure.*

* Besheradi proverb

*By the grace of Imran, King Nassim survived the attack on his life by the cultists of Dirgion; but thereafter he lived in fear that the assassins would come again. So terrified of threats to his life grew Nassim that he commanded the construction of a grand citadel to secure his person. When it was finished, Nassim’s citadel boasted three imposing walls, each stronger and higher than the last, and each secured by a mighty gate. Atop the walls and gatehouses were stationed guards day and night, and neither man nor beast was permitted to pass into the inner circuit of the citadel without being thrice inspected. Yet King Nassim’s works were to no avail. A year and a day after his citadel was completed, the king was found dead in his bedchamber, slain by a single blow to the head. The assassin was never found.*
