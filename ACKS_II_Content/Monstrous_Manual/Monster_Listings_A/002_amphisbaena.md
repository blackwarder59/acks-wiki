### Amphisbaena

Among the most perilous of desert denizens, amphisbaena are the offspring of an escaped sorcerous creation of times gone by, great snakes 30’ long with heads at each end of their sinuous bodies. An amphisbaena winds its intricately-patterned sand-colored body sideways across the sand, each head leading by turn, leaving great twisting tracks in its wake as it seeks prey to sate its appetite. Desert nomads claim the flesh of an amphisbaena is a potent aphrodisiac, and the monsters are frequently hunted for their components.

###### Combat

An amphisbaena attacks with two **venomous** bites, one from each, dealing 1d4 {!P} damage each. Any creature damaged by an amphisbaena’s bite must make a Death saving throw. If the save fails, the creature dies of poison 1d4+2 turns later.

An amphisbaena’s heads are rivalrous and actively struggle to keep prey away from the other head. Should both heads latch on to the same target, this can have disastrous consequences. If an amphisbaena successfully attacks the same target with both bites in the same attack routine, the struggle between the two heads **rends** the target for an additional 2d10 {Se!} damage. If this damage reduces the target to 0 hp or less, the target is torn limb from limb and instantly slain. The amphisbaena can cleave after rending a target with whichever bite dealt more damage.

In addition to biting prey, an amphisbaena can attack by constriction. A successful constriction attack deals 2d8 {B!} damage to the creature and **restrains** it. Thereafter, while the creature remains restrained, the amphisbaena can automatically deal 2d8 {B!} damage on its initiative each round to the restrained creature without having to make an attack throw. Doing so counts as the amphisbaena’s constriction attack.

###### Ecology

When amphisbaena are encountered in their dens, there is a 7% chance per amphisbaena that it is incubating 2d4 eggs. Amphisbaena eggs have 1 hp and weigh 1/6 st.

###### Spoils

A slain amphisbaena can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the following components useful in magic research:

* 2 fangs (4 st, 240gp, *poison, neutralize poison*)
* 2 spines (4 st, 240gp, *choking grip, iron maiden*)
* hunk of flesh (5 4/6 st, 340gp, *allure, enslave humanoid*)

If not used for magic research, an amphisbaena’s fangs fetch 4gp and weigh 1/6 st. Its venom (onset time 1d10 turns, +2 saving modifier, target suffers 4d4 {Po} damage on a failed Death saving throw) fetches 200gp and weighs 1/6 st.
