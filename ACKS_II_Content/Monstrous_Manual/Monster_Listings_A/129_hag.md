### Hag

Hunched, twisted humanoids of female form, hags are hideously ugly, with distorted features, long spindly arms, lank hair, and filthy talon-like nails. Although superficially human, they are inhumanly strong supernatural beings with iron-hard skin, a natural aptitude for the arcane arts, a malicious intelligence, and a hunger for man-flesh.

However, they are cunning enough to forgo such food if the opportunity to sow greater woe presents itself. While the desperate sometimes seek out their alchemical or sorcerous wisdom, the support of a hag always comes at a terrible cost that may not be apparent until much later.

Hags usually speak Ancient Thrassian, Ancient Zaharan, Classical Auran, Common, and the languages of any local beastmen or humans.

###### Combat

All hags have the abilities of **9th-level witches**, including using appropriate magical items, researching spells, brewing potions, and creating magical items. They can be of any tradition, and usually focus on enchantment and transmogrification magic in order to better ensnare victims.

Hags can also *adjust self* and *bestow curse* once per day as spell-like abilities. They prefer to appear as a beautiful maidens, the better to lure their prey into dropping its guard.

They are **immune** to all mundane damage. As enchanted creatures they can be kept at bay by *holy circle* and destroyed or driven off by *dispel evil*.

###### Ecology

Hags inhabit the forlorn and forsaken places of the world, the dismal swamps, tumble-down ruins, yawning caves, and blasted heaths. Although sometimes encountered ranging the wilds gathering ingredients or on errands of evil, they are most frequently found in their lairs in groups of three, cackling as they study or work villainy.

Hags can reproduce only by impregnation from Lawful human men, and always birth girls. Many myths describe hags demanding the seed of heroes in exchange for their assistance. The children of such unions (who are sometimes raised by the hags but more often raised by unwitting villagers or clergy) only discover their true nature at puberty, when they begin to rapidly develop magic powers and age into hideous crones.
