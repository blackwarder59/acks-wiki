### Frog, Giant

The giant frog, sometimes called the terror of the marshlands, is a massive amphibian measuring about 4’ long and 2’6” high and weighing up to 200lbs.

###### Combat

Giant frogs have **acute olfaction** and gain a +1 bonus to avoid surprise in its natural habitat. When in dark, damp environments such as bogs and swamps, giant frogs are **naturally stealthy**. Creatures encountering them in such habitats suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls.

The giant frog is slightly smaller than closely-related giant toad (p. XX), and lacks its ability to swallow its victims whole. However, a giant frog can make **titanic leaps**. As a movement action, it can jump up to 30’ in any direction (90’ if outdoors). If it **jumps on a creature**, the creature must make a Paralysis saving throw. If the save fails, the creature is knocked **prone** and the frog can immediately bite it with a +2 bonus to its attack throw and damage roll. If the save succeeds, the creature retains its footing. The frog can still bite it, but does not gain any bonus.

###### Ecology

Giant frogs do not care for their young and in fact may feed on them when other food sources aren’t available. When giant frogs are encountered in their lair, there will be a spawning pool somewhere nearby with a total of 1d6 x 100 giant 5”-long tadpoles. Giant tadpoles have AC 0, Spd 60’, 1 hp, ML -4, and do not fight.

Giant tadpoles eventually metamorphize into juvenile giant frogs and exit the spawning pool. Juvenile giant frogs are essentially indistinguishable from common frogs and are not usually noticed by adventurers. From time to time, however, a young boy or girl will capture a frog as a pet only to discover its true nature when it doesn’t stop growing…

###### Spoils

A slain giant frog can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following component:

* forelegs (3/6 st, 29gp, *chameleon, leaping*)

Being both stupid and surly, giant frogs are rarely tamed and trained. Even a trained specimen is not considered worth the cost of its handlers.

###### Lair

From the marshy waters rises a low hummock forested with black alders and willows. The hummock is the lair of a **pair of giant frogs**, while the waters around the hummock squirm with **200 giant tadpoles**. The frogs have lately fed only on their own spawn and will delight in the opportunity for a fresh meal. The frogs have no treasure.
