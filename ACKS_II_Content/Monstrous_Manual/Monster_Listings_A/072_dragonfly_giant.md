### Dragonfly, Giant

Giant dragonflies resemble ordinary dragonflies but have a wingspan of 6’ and a weight of 3 lbs. Their iridescent chitin is highly prized for its durability and glittering coloration.

They are mostly found in or near ponds, lakes, marshes, and rivers, but sometimes can be found in settled fields and gardens near water sources. Though beautiful, they are ferocious predators that hunt warm-blooded creatures and can be a menace to livestock. They sometimes even get a taste for human flesh.

###### Combat

Giant dragonflies have **acute hearing**, **olfaction**, and **vision.** They gain a +3 bonus to avoid surprise in their natural habitat.

Their **aerial mechanoreception** enables them to “see” up to 1350’ by sensing changes in air pressure. Spells or effects that would ordinarily cause blindness do not affect the dragonfly while it is using aerial mechanoreception. However, constructs, plants, oozes, and undead that remain motionless are invisible to the sense. Aerial mechanoreception does not penetrate structures or terrain features.

###### Ecology

Giant dragonflies do not establish nests or exhibit any parental care for their offspring. They lay their eggs either directly in water, on the leaves of aquatic plants, or in wet mud. Dragonfly eggs have 1 hp and weigh 1/300 st.

21 months later, the eggs hatch into aquatic larvae that begin feeding immediately. Dragonfly larvae have Swimming Spd 20’/60’, AC 3, HD 1, and attack with one bite (1d4 {P}).

###### Spoils

A slain giant dragonfly can be harvested with Animal Husbandry 2 for the following components useful in magic research:

* wings (3/6 st, 29gp, *flight, levitation, winged flight*)

A giant dragonfly’s iridescent carapace fetches 20gp and weighs 1/6 st.

###### Lore

*There are two formulae commonly used to impart the power of flight by means of alchemy. The first is a thaumaturgic formula that empowers a potion’s imbiber with the ability to fly without apparent means of locomotion.*

*The second is a transmogrification formula which causes the imbiber to sprout wings capable of flight.*

*Both formulae use the same reagents, the most important of which are the desiccated wings of giant dragonflies. These are traditionally sourced from the black lily marsh southeast of the capital [editor’s note: present-day Viamir Marshes].*
