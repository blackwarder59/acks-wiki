### Crocodile, Large

Crocodiles are carnivorous reptiles that lurk in lake, rivers, swamps, and other shallow waters. While they breathe air, they spend most of their time submerged waiting for prey to come within reach. Large crocodiles are about 20’ long and weigh 2,200 lbs. They are native to the Garupesh River in Somirea and the Kem River in Kemesh.

###### Combat

Large crocodiles have **acute olfaction** and gain a +1 bonus to avoid surprise in its natural habitat. They are **naturally stealthy** when submerged, and creatures encountering them suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls.

###### Ecology

When large crocodiles are encountered in the wilderness, there is a 12% chance per crocodile that it will have 5d10 eggs buried nearby. Large crocodile eggs have 1 hp and weigh 2/6 st.

###### Spoils

A slain large crocodile with exceptional attributes can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following component:

* skull (5 2/6 st, 320gp, *swimming,* armor +2, weapon +2)

A large crocodile's armored hide fetches 150gp and weighs 8 4/6 st.

Large crocodiles are almost as dull-witted and ill-tempered as giant crocodiles, and few are ever tamed and trained.

###### Lore

*Our expedition first encountered one of these beasts during a cruise by pleasure barge from Zhapur to Istakahr. One of our hired guards, Khanu, having drunk too much wine, became overbold, and announced that he would demonstrate his athletic prowess by swimming from the west bank of the Kem to the east. Before our hosts could stop him, the reckless fool had stripped off his tunic and dived into the water.*

*I ran to the bulwark just in time to see Khanu surface, laughing as he paddled towards a log floating nearby. A moment later, his laughter turned to screams, and the waters darkened with crimson. For what a moment before had seemed a log was in truth a submerged crocodile. How well it hid! How swiftly it struck!*

*Were I not certain it was a natural animal, I would find it easy to believe that the Kem crocodile was actually a crossbred monstrosity created by Zaharan alchemy.*

* Toraster the Elder, *Bestiary of Aurëpos*
