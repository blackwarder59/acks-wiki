### Lizard, Giant Horned Chameleon

The giant horned chameleon measures about 7’ long and weighs around 200 lbs. The sages of the Tower of Knowledge believe that giant horned chameleons, along with the other species of giant lizard, were bred from ordinary lizards as fighting beasts and pets by the ancient Thrassians.

Whatever their origin, giant horned chameleons are now widespread throughout the known world. They prefer to live in forests, forested hills, and forested mountains, but can also be found in scrubland, swamps, and underground.

###### Combat

Gant horned chameleons have the uncanny ability to **camouflage** themselves by taking on the color, appearance, and texture of their local surroundings. They can hide as 14th level thieves (2+). They have **acute vision** and gain a +1 bonus to avoid surprise in their natural habitat. They are also **skilled climbers** able to ascend sheer surfaces as if they were thieves (6+).

The giant horned chameleon has two special attacks which it can use in lieu of its regular attacks. Instead of biting a target, it can lash out with its long, sticky tongue to attack creatures up to 15’ away. If the chameleon succeeds on a tongue attack against a small or man-sized creature, it can immediately **yank** the creature adjacent to itself and make a bite attack against it. However, the chameleon cannot cleave with its bite on any round when it makes a tongue attack.

Instead of goring a target, the chameleon can make a tail lash. If this attack succeeds, the target struck must make a successful Paralysis save or be knocked **prone**. If the chameleon knocks its target prone, it can cleave with the tail.

###### Ecology

When a wilderness lair of giant horned chameleons is encountered, there is an 8% chance per lizard that it will have buried a clutch of 1d4+1 eggs nearby. The eggs have 1 hp and weight 1/6 st. Chameleon hatchlings are rarely found in nests, because the creatures immediately disperse into the wild after they emerge from their eggs.

###### Spoils

A slain giant horned chameleon can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following components useful in magic research:

* dorsal scales (3 2/6 st, 200gp, *chameleon, invisibility,* armor +1)
* tongue (2 2/6 st, 150gp, *earth’s excrescence, earth’s wave, telekinesis*)

A giant horned chameleon's single horn fetches 1d3gp and weights 1 st per 10gp value.

Giant horned chameleons are sometimes captured and trained as hunting animals. Though they are as stupid and surly as their cousins, they are the most economically valuable of the giant lizards.
