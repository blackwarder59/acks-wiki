### Equine, Light Horse

Light horses are built for speed and long-distance travel. Domesticated light horses are found throughout Aurëpos, where they are used for riding or war. Wild light horses can be found in Opelenea, Shebatea, and Somirea.

###### Combat

Most light horses are easily frightened (-2 Morale). Some light horses, however, can overcome their skittishness through **training for war**. War-trained light horses gain +2 to morale and (if a horse) one extra hoof attack. The rider of a war-trained light horse can attack with a charge, dealing double damage with a lance, and a war-trained light horse can attack with its hooves during the charge as well.

###### Ecology

When a light horse herd is encountered, there is a 50% chance they will be a matriarchal herd with 1d6 juvenile horses and 1d2 baby horses. (Otherwise, it’s a bachelor herd.) Juveniles have AC 0, Spd 180’, HD 1/2, and attack with 1 hoof (1d2 {B}). Babies have AC -1, Spd 180’, 1 hit point, ML -4, and do not fight.

Light horses are bred for strength, speed, and stamina, and finely-bred specimens often have exceptional attributes (see “Attributes for Monsters,” on p. XXX). Light horses with DEX 13+ have their encounter movement rate adjusted by 20’ x DEX bonus. Their combat speed is adjusted by one-third the encounter speed adjustment. Their ability to travel long distances quickly is limited by their stamina as well as speed, so light horses have their expedition speed adjusted by the lower of DEX or CON bonus x 4 miles. Equines with STR 13+ have their maximum load adjusted by their STR bonus x 2.

###### Spoils

A slain horse with exceptional attributes can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following component:

* hooves (2/6 st., 20gp, *call of the galloping herd, safe travels, swift sword*)

###### Lore

*Of the light or hot-blooded horse breeds, the Opelenean is the most renowned. Prized for its grace and speed, the Opelenean is characterized by a metallic sheen to its coat. The coat itself can be buckskin, black, chestnut, cremello, dun, grey, palomino, or perlino. Palomino Opeleneans, with their shiny golden coats and white manes and tails, are common in the heroic artwork of antiquity, and often associated with crusaders of Ammonar.*

*The Shebatean is a less known, but not less worthy, breed of light horse. While it lacks the agility of the Opelenean, it has better endurance than any other hot-blood. The most common coat colors of this breed are blood bay, black, dun, grey, red roan, and white.*

*Of the Somirean breeds, however, the less said the better…*
