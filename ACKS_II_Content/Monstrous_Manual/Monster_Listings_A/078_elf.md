### Elf

Elves are beautiful demi-humans that average 5 ½' tall, with lithe builds and graceful features. Elves are ageless, always appearing in the prime of life, and can live for upwards of two centuries if not slain in battle. Their skin is always fair, while their hair color ranges from blue-black to platinum and their eyes are amber, blue, golden, hazel, or violet. Elves prefer colorful clothes, usually with a green-and-gray cloak that blends well with the colors of the forest.

###### Combat

Elves encountered outside a haven or fastness will be fellowships or companies of warriors (1st level NPCs) on a patrol or journey. The warriors will be equipped with chain mail, short swords, and long bows.

All of the warriors will be **skilled combatants** who gain a +1 damage bonus. Because of their **attunement to nature**, the warriors alsogain a +1 bonus to surprise rolls when in the wilderness. They are **immune** to diseases caused by undead.

###### Ecology

Each fellowship of elves will be led by a 2nd level elven spellsword. Each company will be led by a 4th level elven spellsword assisted by 1 3rd level elven spellsword and 1 3rd level elven nightblade.

When elves are encountered in a fastness, they will led by an elven spellsword of level 5+1d4. As long as the leader is alive, the elves will gain a +2 bonus to morale rolls. There is a 70% chance the fastness will be protected by 2d6 trained giant raptors and a 70% chance the fastness will have a kennel with 4d6 hunting dogs. There is a 50% chance an elven nightblade of level 5+1d3 will be in the service of the leader.

A newly-established fastness will typically have few or no other residents, but in a long-established fastness, additional elves will be present. In addition to the companies, the fastness will be protected by a militia (0th level troops) of up to 200% of the number of elven warriors. Elven militia have Spd 120’, AC 3, 1 HD, and ML -1. They are usually equipped with leather armor, shield, spear, and short sword.

A long-established fastness will also be home to various elven workers, noncombatants (adolescent, disabled, elderly, nursing, or pregnant) and juveniles, up to a maximum of 850%, 850%, and 1200% of the number of warriors respectively. Workers have Spd 120’, AC 0, 1d6 hp, ML -2, and are equipped with short swords. Noncombatants and juveniles have Spd 90’, AC 0, 1 hp, ML -4, and do not fight. The warriors and militia will fight to the death to defend the noncombatants and juveniles.

Elven leaders should be assigned magic items using the ***ACKS II JJ***rules (p. XX).
