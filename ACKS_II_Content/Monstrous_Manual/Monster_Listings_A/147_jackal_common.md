### Jackal, Common

Jackals are opportunistic wolf-like canines renowned for their adaptability and cunning throughout southern Aurëpos and northern Ulruk. They both hunt for small game and scavenge the carcasses of larger kills. Common jackals are 4’ long and 2’ tall at the shoulder and weigh about 30 lbs.

Jackals are trainable, though not so much as dogs or wolves. Because of their small size, they are not as useful as either. Trained jackals are somewhat popular among the nobility of Kemesh and Opelenea, who delight in seeing the creatures chase and slay vulnerable prey or devour the carcasses of slain foes.

###### Combat

Common jackals have **acute hearing** and **acute olfaction.** They gain a +2 bonus to avoid surprise in their natural habitat. They can track the scent of creatures for up to 4 miles with the equivalent of two ranks of Tracking proficiency.

###### Ecology

Each pack of ordinary jackals will be led by chief (who fights as a hunting dog). When ordinary jackals are encountered in their den, the adults will be rearing 1d6 puppies. Roll 1d6 for age and number: 1-4, it’s 1d2+1 juveniles, 5-6 it’s 1d4+2 babies. Juveniles have AC 0, Spd 150’, HD 1d4 hp, and attack with 1 bite (1d2 {P}). Baby jackals have AC -1, Spd 150’, 1 hp, ML -4, and do not fight.

###### Spoils

A slain jackal with exceptional attributes can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following components:

* fangs (1/6 st, 5gp, *swift strike*)

A jackal’s pelt fetches 1gp and weighs 1/6 st.

Jackals are as intelligent as dogs, but harder to train. Few animal trainers see much advantage in spending time on them.

###### Lair

A dense grove of acacia trees is home to a pack of **four jackals** – the pack leader, his mate, and his two adult offspring. The cunning canines have excavated a shallow den beneath the thorniest acacia, using the dense foliage as a canopy to shield a litter of **six baby jackal pups** from hungry predators and harsh sunlight. The entrance to the den is concealed by scattered brush and the den itself is lined with a soft bedding of dried grasses, leaves, and the occasional feather, providing a warm and comfortable nest for the puppies.
