### Equine, Medium Horse

Medium horses have been bred to be fast, strong and sturdy, but are meant for shorter distance travel. Domesticated medium horses are found throughout Aurëpos. They are neither the best riding nor draft horses, but are ideal for war, and may be trained for any of those roles. Wild medium horses can be found in Celdorea, Jutland, Krysea, Nicea, Rorn, and Tirenea.

###### Combat

Most medium horses are easily frightened. Some medium horses, however, can overcome their skittishness through **training for war**. War-trained medium horses gain +2 to morale and (if a horse) one extra hoof attack. The rider of a war-trained horse can attack with a charge, dealing double damage with a lance, and a war-trained medium horse can attack with its hooves during the charge as well.

###### Ecology

When a herd is encountered, there is a 50% chance they will be a matriarchal herd with 1d6 juvenile horses and 1d2 baby horses. (Otherwise, it’s a bachelor herd.) Juveniles have AC 0, Spd 150’, HD 1+2, and attack with 1 hoof (1d2 {B}). Babies have AC -1, Spd 150’, HD 1, and attack with 1 hoof (1 {B}).

Medium horses are bred for strength, speed, and stamina, and finely-bred horses often have exceptional attributes (see “Attributes for Monsters,” on p. XXX). Medium horses with DEX 13+ have their encounter speed adjusted by 15’ x DEX bonus. Their combat speed is adjusted by one-third the encounter speed adjustment. Their ability to travel long distances quickly is limited by their stamina as well as speed, so medium horses have their expedition speed adjusted by the lower of DEX or CON bonus x 3. Medium horses with STR 13+ have their maximum load adjusted by their STR bonus x 3 st.

###### Spoils

A slain horse with exceptional attributes can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following component:

* hooves (5/6 st., 50gp, *call of the galloping herd, safe travels, swift sword*)

###### Lore

*When Audarius Valerian Tarkaun won the Battle of Zidium, he did not just defeat the Celdorean thalassocracy; he won control of Ivorea, also known as Rorn. And that victory secured for the Empire its access to the finest breed of warm-blooded horses found anywhere in Aurëpos.*

*The Rornish horse is a proud and majestic equine with a glossy coat, a long smooth mane, and a flowing tail. Purebloods of the breed invariably have coats of either black, dapple grey, sorrel, or white, but mixed breeds of similar conformation can be found in many other colors.*
