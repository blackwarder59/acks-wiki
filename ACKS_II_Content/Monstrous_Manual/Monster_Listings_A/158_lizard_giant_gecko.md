### Lizard, Giant Gecko

The giant gecko is a 5’ long nocturnal predator that weighs about 110 lbs. The sages of the Tower of Knowledge believe that the giant gecko, along with the other species of giant lizard, was bred from ordinary lizards as fighting beasts and pets by the ancient Thrassians.

Whatever their origin, giant geckos are now widespread throughout the known world. They are extremely diverse in their range, and can be found in barrens, deserts, forests, jungles, and even urban settlements. Some also take up residence in warm, humid caves and dungeons.

###### Combat

Giant geckos, like their smaller cousins, are **natural climbers**. They can climb utterly unimpeded across vertical surfaces or move upside down across ceilings at their combat movement rate. They can attack with their bites and defend themselves normally, but cannot charge or run while climbing. (Note that this is not just Climbing proficiency.)

###### Ecology

When a wilderness lair of giant geckos is encountered, there is a 25% chance per lizard that it will have hidden a clutch of 1d2 eggs under rocks, in crevices, or in tree hollows nearby. The eggs have 1 hp and weight 1/6 st. Gecko hatchlings are rarely found in nests, because the creatures immediately disperse into the wild after they emerge from their eggs.

###### Spoils

A slain giant gecko can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following component:

* feet (1 stone, 65gp, s*pider climb,* armor +1)

Adventurers sometimes attempt to capture and rear giant geckos, but the creatures are quite stupid and surly and most such efforts fail.

###### Encounter

Rising from the arid terrain is a formation of nineteen sandstone rocks shaped like stunted trees. The “trees” are each between 18’ and 25’ tall, and were formed by years of erosion from strong winds carrying rough sand. Perched on the “tree” tops are **six giant gecko lizards**. One of the geckos has recently laid a clutch of **two gecko eggs**,concealed by sandstone pebbles in the mist of the rock formation. If the eggs are threatened, the giant gecko lizards will attack.
