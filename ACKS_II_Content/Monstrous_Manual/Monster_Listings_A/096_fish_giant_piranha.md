### Fish, Giant Piranha

These giant carnivorous fish can reach a length of 5' and weight of up to 750 lbs. Giant piranha were natively found only in the warm rivers and lakes of Ulruk, but in the 9th century B.E. the Zaharans bred a sub-species adapted to the cooler waters of Aurëpos that has proliferated widely.

###### Combat

Giant piranha have **acute vision** that grants a +1 bonus to avoid surprise in their natural habitat. They also have a lateral line system that affords them **aquatic mechanoreception**. Piranha can “see” in water up to 180’ by sensing changes in water current and water pressure. Spells or effects that would ordinarily cause blindness do not affect the piranha while it is using aquatic mechanoreception. However, creatures that are not in the water are invisible to them. Aquatic mechanoreception does not penetrate structures or terrain features.

The creatures attack nearly anything that moves, and are always hostile when encountered. As many as 8 giant piranhas can attack a single victim at a time!

Worse, if any creature in the water is injured with piercing or slashing damage, the blood will trigger a **feeding frenzy** in all piranha within 60’. When frenzied, piranha fight to the death and never check morale.

###### Ecology

Unlike most fish, a giant piranha extends parental care towards its offspring. The female deposit the eggs in a nest dug by the male, and the male then guards the nest and aerates the eggs until they hatch. Therefore, when a nest of giant piranha is encountered, the fish will be guarding 3d6 x 10 eggs. Giant catfish eggs have 1 hp and weigh 1/50 st.

###### Spoils

A slain giant piranha can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following component:
