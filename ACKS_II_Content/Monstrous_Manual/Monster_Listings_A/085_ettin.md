### Ettin

Ettins are two-headed giants that stand about 17’ tall and weigh about 3,600 lbs. They seem to be related to orcs, for their faces have pig-like snouts and tusks, and some sages believe they were a poorly-bred cross of hydras with orcs, perhaps precursors to trolls.

Each of an ettin’s two heads has an independent consciousness and personality. Each head controls one arm and one leg, forcing the two to cooperate to survive. One head is usually dominant over the other, and typically gets first bite of any food and has better musculature on its “side” of the body. Despite this lopsidedness, the heads can still be quite quarrelsome about where they should go and what they should do. Many adventurers have reported seeing ettin heads arguing loudly with each other and, occasionally, pummeling each other over some difference of opinion.

Because of their orcish blood, ettins are dim-witted, dirty, and malicious. They generally wear little more than tattered skins and wield simple clubs, tree branches, or stones. Ettins can speak the bombastic language of giants as well as simple words and phrases in Common.

###### Combat

With two heads to keep watch, ettins are **twice as alert** as other creatures. They gain a +1 bonus to avoid surprise. Because ettins have **two minds in one body**, creatures encountering them make two reaction rolls, one for each head. If one head ends up Friendly and the other Hostile, the ettin might attack adventurers with one arm and attack itself with the other!

In combat, ettins can swing with their fists or weapons, dealing 3d6 {W!} damage with their dominant arm and 2d8 {W!} with their subordinate arm. When armed with piercing or slashing weapons, ettins can deliver **vicious blows** that deal an additional 2 points per swing. When armed with bludgeoning weapons, ettins can **topple** small or man-sized creatures with every swing. A small or man-sized creature struck by an ettin’s swing must make a Paralysis saving throw. If the save fails, the creature takes damage and is knocked prone. If the save succeeds, the creatures take damage but stays on its feet. The ettin can cleave if the creature fails its save against its swing.

###### Ecology

Ettins are loners, and live together in small numbers only on occasion. When 2 or more ettins are encountered in a lair, they have a 25% chance to be a family. (If not, they are just a bachelor gang.) An ettin family will be accompanied by 1d2 juveniles and 1d2 baby ettins. Juvenile ettins have AC 4, Spd 90’, HD 5, and attack with 2 swings (1d8 {B} / 1d8 {S}). Baby ettins have AC 3, Spd 90’, HD 3+1, and attack with 2 swings (1d3 {B} / 1d4 {B} damage.
