### Fly, Giant Carnivorous

The origin of giant carnivorous flies is unknown, but some Auran sages believe they were created by the ancient elves in order to cleanse their forests of giant killer bees and spiders.

Giant carnivorous flies resemble ordinary flies, save that they measure 3' long and weigh 4lbs. They carry golden-yellow markings on their ebony carapaces that make them resemble giant bees.

###### Combat

Giant flies have **acute olfaction** and gain a +1 bonus to avoid surprise in its natural habitat. They can “see” by means of **aerial mechanoreception** (60’). They are **naturally stealthy** when in their native habitat, and creatures encountering them suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls.

By preference they prey on giant killer bees, spiders, and other venomous vermin. They are **immune** to the poisonous damage dealt by arane, attercops, giant killer bees, giant wasps, and giant spiders.

In combat, a giant carnivorous fly attacks with its long proboscis, which ejects a corrosive agent that deals 1d8 acidic damage. If the acidic damage reduces their target to 0 or fewer hp, the fly immediately sucks up its dissolved flesh, killing it instantly.

###### Ecology

When a nest of giant carnivorous flies is encountered, there is a 5% chance per fly that it will have recently laid 2d6 eggs nearby. The eggs have 1 hp and weigh 1/1000 st (1 coin). Carnivorous maggots are rarely found in nests, because the larvae immediately disperse into the wild after they emerge from their eggs. The maggots will pupate into giant carnivorous flies after 6 months of feeding.

###### Spoils

A slain giant carnivorous fly can be harvested with Animal Husbandry 2 for the following component:

* tarsal segments (3/6 st, 29gp, *leaping silent step*)

###### Encounter

The fallen hollow log of a gnarled old teak tree is the lair of **ten giant carnivorous flies**. The flies will leap out to attack any prey that approaches within 30’.

Giant carnivorous flies (10): Spd 30’/180’ fly, AC 3, HD 2, hp 10 each, #AT 1 (bite 9+), Dmg 1d8 {P}, Save F1, ML 0, AL N, XP 20; Special: stealth (imposes -2 penalty on surprise rolls)

Inside the hollow are the remains of the flies’ recent victims – a black bear, a deer, and an elderly goblin. A pair of claws (3gp each) can be harvested from the bear, while the goblin’s corpse has a broken dagger with a scrimshaw hilt (30gp), a carved bone figurine of Iskara, Mother of Monsters (25gp), and a small pouch holding 1 lb of woundwort (10gp). The goblin’s eye sockets are empty and surrounded by old scar tissue.
