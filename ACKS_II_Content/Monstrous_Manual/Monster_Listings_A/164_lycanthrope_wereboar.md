### Lycanthrope, Wereboar

Wereboars are lycanthropes who can transform into giant boars. In their boar form, they measure about 7’4” long and weigh 650 – 700 lbs. In their human form, they often have snub noses with large nostrils and long, sharp lower canines.

The Chthonic god Bel, the Slaughterprince, fastened the first wereboars from the members of his blood-sacrificing berserker cult. Every wereboar combines the ill-temper of a wild boar with the bloodthirsty savagery of a berserker, making for a most unpleasant and brutal creature.

Wereboars attempt to pass their infection to strong and powerful warriors. However, they are so savage in their berserk bloodlust that they often kill the prey they intend to infect.

###### Combat

In beast form, wereboars have **acute hearing** and **acute olfaction.** They gain a +2 bonus to avoid surprise in their natural habitat. They can track the scent of creatures for up to 4 miles with the equivalent of two ranks of Tracking proficiency.

In both beast and human form, wereboars can go **berserk** anytime they make melee attacks. While berserk, a wereboar gains a +2 bonus to attack throws and becomes immune to fear. However, the wereboar has a -2 penalty to AC and becomes limited in its tactics. It cannot conduct defensive movement to retreat or withdraw from an enemy within 5’ and cannot move in such a way that the range between itself and the nearest visible threat would increase. It must advance 5’ after cleaving if necessary to do so to engage an enemy and it has sufficient movement. Once it has begun, the berserker age cannot be ended until combat ends. A wereboar that goes berserk in human form has a cumulative 10% chance of transforming into beast form each round.

When in human form, wereboars favor battle axes, hand axes, morning stars, spears, swords, and shields. They tend to eschew missile fire.

###### Ecology

Wereboars make their dens in huts or shacks, preferably in wooded regions with wildlife to hunt and the occasional traveler to rob.

###### Spoils

A slain wereboar can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the following components useful in magic research:

* blood (2 st, 115gp, *deflect ordinary weapons, skinchange*)
* scalp (1 4/6 st, 100gp, *righteous wrath, transform beast*)

Because they revert to human form when slain, wereboars cannot be harvested for claws, fangs, or fur.
