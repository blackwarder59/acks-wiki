### Cat, Catamount

Catamounts are tawny-haired ambush predators found in the high meadows and lower slopes of the Jutting and Meniri Mountains as well as the forests of Northern and Southern Argollë.

Most catamounts avoid humans and demi-humans, attacking only if starving, provoked, or protecting young.

###### Combat

Catamounts have **acute hearing** and **acute olfaction.** They gain a +2 bonus to avoid surprise in their natural habitat. They can track the scent of creatures for up to 4 miles with the equivalent of two ranks of Tracking proficiency. They are **incredibly agile** (as Acrobatics proficiency at 7+) and **skilled climbers**, able to ascend sheer surfaces as if they were thieves (5+).

Their **lightning reflexes** grant a +1 bonus to initiative. They are **naturally stealthy** when in their native habitat, and creatures encountering them suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls.

If a catamount charges a creature or leaps over it (using Acrobatics), and successfully hits it with both claws, it immediately **pounces** onthe creature. The catamount’s subsequent bite attack automatically hits and the creature that has been pounced on must make a successful size-adjusted Paralysis saving throw or be knocked **prone**.

###### Ecology

When catamounts are encountered in a wilderness den, there is a 50% chance the catamounts will be rearing catamount cubs. Roll 1d6 for age and number: 1-3 it’s 1d2 juvenile catamounts, 4-6 it’s 1d4 baby catamounts. Juvenile catamounts have AC 2, Spd 180’, HD 1+3, and attack with 2 claws (1 {S}) and a bite (1d3 {P}). Baby catamounts have AC 1, Spd 180’, HD 1, and attack with a fierce nibble (1 {P}).

###### Spoils

A slain catamount with exceptional attributes can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following component:

* tongue (1 4/6 st, 100gp, *call of the great cats, silent step*)

A catamount's pelt fetches 25gp and weighs 4/6 st.

Catamounts are relatively easy to tame and train compared to their larger cousins, but are not as popular as the speedy cheetahs or majestic lions.

###### Encounter

48’ up a steep slope, a small rock outcropping protected by a long rocky overhang is serving as a sheltered den for a **catamount** along with her **three baby cubs**.

###### Note

Catamount is an old European term for ‘mountain cat.” The catamount in the Auran Empire setting is analogous to the now-extinct *Panthera pardoides*, also known as the European jaguar and Ostend panther. It can also be used to represent the North American cougar.
