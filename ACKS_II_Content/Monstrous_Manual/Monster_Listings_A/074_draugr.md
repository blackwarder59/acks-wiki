### Draugr

While wights of various sorts can be found in barrows throughout Jutland and Rorn, the most terrible of undead there are the draugr. Resembling huge men with swollen blue flesh emitting the reek of decay, draugr retain their human intellect – albeit an intellect riven with cruelty and a relentless desire for raw flesh and blood.

###### Combat

Draugr have the ability to use each of the following **spell-like abilities** thrice per day: *bestow curse*, *cause disease*, *cause fear*, *illumination*, *passageway,* and *tenebrosity*. They can also *skinchange* into a bull, cat, horse, or seal thrice per day. Draugr with 9 HD (or more) can use the following spell-like abilities once per week: *divination* and *summon weather*. All draugr have the ability to take *gaseous form* at will.

Sometimes draugr will equip themselves with weapons and shields selected from the grave goods in their barrows. Increase the draugr’s AC by the value of any armor or shield equipped. Draugr armed with weapons have one attack per round, dealing double damage dice by weapon. A draugr's weapons and armor are left behind if it assumes *gaseous form*. A draugr always deals extraordinary damage.

Draugr are **immune** to enchantment effects, necrotic damage, poisonous damage, and mundane bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. They are **resistant** to cold and electrical damage.

Reducing a draugr to 0 hp does not destroy the creature; it merely forces the draugr into its *gaseous form*at the start of its next initiative. Any additional damage dealt to a draugr forced into *gaseous form* has no effect. The draugr will reform with full hit points after resting in its barrow for 8 hours. If a draugr is reduced to 0 hp while in its barrow and its head cut off before its next initiative, it will be unable to enter *gaseous form*for 8 hours. During this time, if its body is then burnt and its ashes scattered in a lake, river, or ocean, the draugr is fully destroyed.

They are rendered inactive by sunlight, and prefer to slumber in their barrows during the day until nightfall or an intruder awakens them. A draugr exposed to sunlight must make a Paralysis saving throw each round at the start of its initiative. If the saving throw fails, the draugr is **helpless** until the start of its next initiative.

Anyone slain by a draugr within its barrow will rise after 24 hours as a **haugbui in thrall** to the draugr. Draugr are rebuked as vampires, but can make a Spells saving throw to ignore the effects of being rebuked while in their barrow.

###### Ecology

Draugr are restless undead. Driven by their hunger for living flesh, they often range far and wide from their barrows, even taking to the waves to plague those aboard ship. Not even the most secure tomb can contain them.

When a draugr is encountered in its barrow, it has a 10% chance per HD to be guarded by 1d6 haugbui in thrall to it.

###### Spoils

A destroyed draugr can be harvested with Healing 2 for the following component:

* cremated ashes (30 4/6 - 51 4/6 st, 1840 – 3100 gp, *bestow curse, cause disease, deflect ordinary weapons, frighten humanoid, gaseous form, giant strength, passageway, skinchange, tenebrosity; divination, summon weather* [9 HD+])

###### Encounter

Rising from the plain here is a tumulus mound of earth, some 200’ in diameter and 32’ high, now overgrown with grass. The mound is so old that it would resemble a natural hill, save for its encircling revetment of 4’ high stones. This is the barrow of an ancient warrior of grim repute, Magnhild the Dragonslayer.

Entrance to the mound was originally by means of a vaulted archway set between a pair of 10’ tall portal stones, but one of these now leans sideways and blocks the entrance. If the portal stone is moved (requiring a successful Dungeonbashing throw with -4 penalty), it reveals a long passage leading 65’ inward to a 15’ square central chamber with a corbelled roof, where a cairn of rune-carved skulls stands as a trophy of the buried hero. From the central chamber, a network of burial chambers extends in a cross-like pattern, left, right, and straight ahead. All the passage and chamber walls are made with large stones, fitted together, and have stone slab roofs 8’ above.

The three burial chambers collectively hold **6 haugbui**, who rest on sepulchers in grey burial shrouds. **Magnhild**, now a **draugr**, slumbers inside a hidden vault accessible only by means of a secret door in the central chamber. The switch to open the secret door is hidden below the cairn of skulls. (Characters who do not state they are moving the skulls will only find the switch with a successful Searching throw, but characters who actively move the skulls will automatically find the switch.)

In the draugr’s chambers are its many grave goods. 1,000ep and 4,000gp are stored in a sturdy oak chest, as well as a pair of flawless diamonds (4,000gp each) and a wrought gold goblet (900gp). A carved ivory war-horn (800gp) hangs on the wall above the chest, alongside *Drakdräpare*,a pattern-welded *two-handed sword +1, +3 v. dragons* with a hilt in the shape of a dragon,sheathed in a fine wood scabbard inlaid with ivory (500gp).

On the opposite wall is a kite-shaped shield that once belonged to the draugr’s sworn foe; it bears a death-curse (*cursed shield -1*) laid down with its wearer’s dying words. A wall-niche holds two gourds holding *oil of sharpness* and a bone case with a *scroll of ward against magic* written in Old Jutlandic.

The haugbui will awaken if anyone enters their chambers, or disturbs the cairn of skulls in the central chamber. 6 rounds after the haugbui are awakened, the draugr will enter via *passageway*(so as not to reveal the secret passage), seeking to slay those who have disturbed his rest. When it awakens, the draugr will equip itself with the *two-handed sword +1, +3 v. dragons* from its crypt*.* It always wears a rusty chainmail byrnie and an iron *ring of command human* set with bloodstones.

**Magnhild the Dragonslayer (draugr):** Spd 120’ AC 11, HD 9\*\*\*\*, hp 50, #AT 2 (claws 2+) or 1 (*two-handed sword +1* 1+), Dmg 1d10 {S!} /1d10 {S!} or 2d10+1 {S!}, Save F9, ML +3, AL C, XP 3,100; Special: hard to kill (*gaseous form* at 0hp), immunity (enchantment effects, poisonous damage, mundane bludgeoning / slashing / piercing damage), resistance (cold and electrical damage), spell-like abilities (*gaseous form* at will, *bestow curse*, *cause disease*, *cause fear*, *darkness*, *faerie fire*, *passwall, skinchange* 3/day, *divination, summon weather* 1/week,) vulnerability to sunlight (Paralysis save or helpless)
