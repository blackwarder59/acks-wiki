### Faerie, Knocker

2’ tall old men with exaggerated features and large eyes, knockers are mine faeries dwelling deep within the earth. They invariably carry picks, hammers, and shovels with which they excavate and dig for metals and minerals. They bear no ill will towards dwarves and human miners as they encounter, though they are loathe to reveal themselves directly.

Indeed, given gifts of surface food and praises, knockers will warn the delvers of other folk of impending danger by loudly knocking on the rocks and tunnel walls nearby. Like most faeries, however, they are not above minor practical jokes.

Knockers are found primarily in Jutting Mountains. Because knockers possess powerful magic to delve the depths of the earth, many of the Jutting jarls have sought to enlist the aid of knockers for their great works; all such attempts have ended in disaster for the dwarves. Knockers are very rare in the Meniri Mountains, where nymphs predominate, and the Meniri dwarves insist knockers are just a wild superstition of their uncivilized brethren.

Knockers speak the lilting language of faeries and the languages spoken by the local dwarves, gnomes, and kobolds.

###### Combat

While not invisible, knockers are **naturally stealthy** when underground. Creatures encountering them suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls.

Knockers can use *earthen mire* once per hour as a spell-like ability, which they use to aid in delving for ore.

###### Ecology

Knockers dwell in vaults like dwarves – but their vaults are always curiously “off,” as if they were delved in imitation of the dwarven vaults but without an understanding of their function.

Like brownies, knockers do not count women or children of any sort as part of their number. They reproduce by transforming abandoned, orphaned, and/or unloved dwarven, goblin, gnomish, or kobold children into their own kind in magic rituals performed in places of power on holy days. The children remember their old life dimly as if a dream., which fades with time.

Knockers never steal children from loving dwarven or gnomish parents, but consider all beastmen whelps to be unloved. When the deep tunnels begin to reverberate with knocks, beastmen breeders know to keep their whelps in hand.

###### Spoils

A knocker vault will always be located near an ore deposit. See *By This Axe* p. XX for rules on ore deposits.

A slain knocker can be harvested with Healing 1 for the following component:

* eyes (1/6 st, 13gp, *lightless vision, locate treasure, shrinking*)
