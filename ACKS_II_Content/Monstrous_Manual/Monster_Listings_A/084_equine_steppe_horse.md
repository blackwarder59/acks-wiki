### Equine, Steppe Horse

Steppe horses are small but sturdy breeds with exceptional strength and endurance. Steppe horses can be used for draft, riding, or war. Wild steppe horses are found only in the great grasslands of western Somirea and Skysostan. Skysos nomads usually travel with at least two steppe horses each, alternating each day so they can maintain pace.

Brave, clever, and easily trained, they are **efficient grazers** and can graze for their full day’s rations with their ancillary activities, enabling them to dedicate their day to travel. They can be used in an army without a supply cost. Due to their **sturdy conformation**,steppe horses can carry a normal load of 25 st (instead of 20 st), though their maximum load is only 40 st. They have **rugged endurance** (as Endurance proficiency) and can force march for one day without penalty, plus one additional day for each point of CON bonus.

###### Combat

Most steppe horses are easily frightened (Morale -1). Some steppe horses, however, can overcome their skittishness through **training for war**. War-trained steppe horses gain +2 to morale and (if a horse) one extra hoof attack. The rider of a war-trained steppe horse can attack with a charge, dealing double damage with a lance, and a war-trained equine may attack with its hooves during the charge as well.

Steppe horses are bred for strength, speed, and stamina, and finely-bred horses often have exceptional attributes (see “Attributes for Monsters,” on p. XXX). Steppe horses with DEX 13+ have their encounter speed adjusted by 17.5’ x DEX bonus. Their combat speed is adjusted by one-third the encounter speed adjustment. Their ability to travel long distances quickly is limited by their stamina as well as speed, so steppe horses have their expeditions peed rate adjusted by the lower of DEX or CON bonus x 3.5 miles. Steppe horses with STR 13+ have their maximum load adjusted by their STR bonus x 2.5 st.

###### Ecology

When a steppe horse herd is encountered, there is a 50% chance they will be a matriarchal herd with 1d6 juvenile horses and 1d2 baby horses (Otherwise, it’s a bachelor herd.) Juveniles have AC 0, Spd 180’, HD 1, and attack with 1 hoof (1d2 {B}). Babies have AC -1, Spd 180’, HD ½, and attack with 1 hoof (1 {B}).

###### Spoils

A slain horse with exceptional attributes can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following component:

* hooves (2/6 st., 20gp, *call of the galloping herd, safe travels, vigor*)

###### Lore

*These Skysos are small men on small ponies and they shall break before our onslaught. Ready the charge.*

* Last known words of Legate Destrius Dextenor, just prior to the defeat of the 11th Imperial Cavalry by the Great Kaǧan Khabul of the Skysos.
