### Fungus, Shrieking

A shrieking fungus, sometimes called a shrieker, is a sessile fungus that grows in dark, subterranean places. Resembling a 3’ tall mushroom, shriekers are pale lavender to dull gray in color, dotted with purple spots. Shrieking fungi closely resemble violet fungi, with which they often grow in symbiotic patches. They are named for their notorious propensity for making a loud noise when disturbed. Found in dank caves, damp dungeons, and other dark, wet locations underground, they are virtually never seen on the surface. Some sporecasters have claimed that shrieking fungi can grow in the dank flesh of birds or mammals. However, this has not been confirmed by the sages of the Tower of Knowledge, who found the whole investigation rather appalling.

###### Combat

Shrieking fungi lack the senses of ordinary animals. However, the spots on their caps are **photosensitive** and can detect light to a range of 60’. They also **echolocate**,emitting a constant subsonic hum with which they can “see” to a range of 30’.

Immediately upon detecting light or movement, shriekers begin to emit the wailing scream that gives them their name. Once a shrieker starts shrieking, it continues to do so each round that it detects light or movement and for 1d3 rounds thereafter, or until it is killed.

A single shrieker’s screams can be heard to a range of 320’ in ordinary environments (double the range in quiet environments, halve it in loud environments); for each additional shrieker, the range of earshot is increased by 30’. If there are any stocked monsters within earshot, they will respond to the alarm at the Judge’s discretion.

In addition, if there are wandering monsters in the dungeon, the Judge will make an encounter throw every round that the shriekers scream. If the throw results in an encounter, the wandering monsters attracted by the shrieker(s) will arrive in 2d6 rounds.

Shrieking fungi are **immune** to enchantment effects and to poisonous damage (except from poisons specifically designed to work on fungi).

###### Ecology

Shrieking fungi reproduce biannually by dispersing tiny spores that are invisible to the naked eye. These spores are then carried by underground air currents throughout the subterranean environment. Attempts to breed shrieking fungi in captivity have failed,

Due to their symbiotic relationship with violet fungi, anytime a patch of shrieking fungi is encountered, there is a 20% chance they will be intermingled with a patch of 1d4 violet fungi.

###### Spoils

A destroyed shrieking fungus can be harvested with Alchemy for the following component:
