### Faerie, Spriggan

Standing just over 4’ tall, spriggans resemble gnarled, nasty old men with overlarge heads clad in rough clothing and leather. They are as malicious as they are ugly.

Like other faeries, spriggans are found primarily in northern Aurëpos, particularly in Northern Argollë, Jutland, and Rorn. Though some dwell in Southern Argollë, they are otherwise rare in the south, where nymphs rather than faeries are found.

Spriggans speak the lilting language of faeries and the languages spoken by goblins, gnomes, and humans of their region.

###### Combat

Spriggans can **summon weather** as a spell-like ability once per day. They use this power to draw ominous and unpleasant weather to their lairs, discouraging outsiders from approaching, or to punish local settlements with drought, frost, or storm.

Far more formidable, however, is their ability to grow in stature. A spriggan can **enlarge** as a spell-like ability at will. While enlarged, the spriggan stands 8’ tall and weighs 480 lbs. Its strength increases proportionately, such that it gains +2 to melee attack throws and deals an additional die of damage with every physical attack. The damage dealt is extraordinary. The spriggan also gains a +8 bonus to Dungeonbashing proficiency throws and doubles its normal carrying capacity.

###### Ecology

Bandits and thieves by nature, spriggans lair in ruins and cairns, jealously guarding their ill-gotten gains, leaving only to raid and steal from others or to hire out their services as mercenaries and guards. As with all faeries, they are found primarily in the northern reaches of Aurëpos.

Like redcaps, spriggans do not have women or children of any sort. They reproduce by stealing the young children of goblins, gnomes, dwarves, halflings, or humans, turning them into their own kind in magic rituals performed in places of power on unholy days. The newborn spriggan remember its old life dimly as if a dream, which fades with time.
