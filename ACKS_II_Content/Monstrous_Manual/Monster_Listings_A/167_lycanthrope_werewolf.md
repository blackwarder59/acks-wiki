### Lycanthrope, Werewolf

Werewolves are lycanthropes who can transform into wolves. In their wolf form, they stand about 2.5” to 3’ tall at the shoulder and weigh about 180 lbs. In their human form, they often have large noses, strong jaws, and wolfish grins with large canines.

The Chthonic god Nargund, the Beast Lord, created the first werewolves, which were also the very first lycanthropes. As the progenitors of lycanthropy, werewolves are dominated by their animal nature more than other lycanthropes.

###### Combat

In beast form, werewolves have **acute hearing** and **acute olfaction.** They gain a +2 bonus to avoid surprise in their natural habitat. They can track the scent of creatures for up to 4 miles with the equivalent of two ranks of Tracking.

Due to their powerful jaws, werewolves have **bone-breaking bites**. If the werewolf succeeds on an attack throw with an unmodified 20 , the creature bitten must make a Death saving throw. If the save succeeds, the creature suffers double the ordinary damage dice (4d4 {P!}). If the save fails, the creature suffers triple the ordinary damage (6d4 {P!}) and has a limb broken. Roll 1d6 to determine which limb is broken: 1-2 weapon hand, 3 weapon arm, 4-5 near leg, 6 far leg. A broken limb has the same game effect as a missing limb (***ACKS II RR***Permanent wounds tables, p. XX – XX) until it heals. A broken wound heals after 180 days, or 90 days under treatment of a healer.

###### Ecology

Werewolves organize themselves into packs led by the strongest and fiercest. As they age, werewolves tend to spend more and more of their time in beast form. They may go weeks, months, or even years without reverting to human form. Many werewolves eventually come to live in burrowed holes, talus caves, and other natural dens.

###### Spoils

A slain werewolf can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the following components useful in magic research:

* blood (1 1/6 st, 70gp, *deflect ordinary weapons, skinchange*)
* scalp (1 st, 65gp, *call of the wolf, transform beast*)

Because they revert to human form when slain, werewolves cannot be harvested for claws, fangs, or fur.
