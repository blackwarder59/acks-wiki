### Beastman, Goblin

Goblins are repellent beastmen bred from dwarves and gnolls by the ancient Zaharans to fight in the narrow tunnels of the dwarven vaults. Goblins stand 3’ to 3 ½’ tall and weigh 45 lbs, with strong, wiry builds. Their eyes are usually dull and glazed, varying in color from red to yellow, and sometimes flicker red in the dark. Goblins’ skin color ranges from yellow through any shade of orange to a deep red; usually all members of a single tribe are about the same color. Goblins are archenemies of dwarves, who they hate above all other humanoids, followed closely by their distaste for gnomes. Goblins typically wear drab earth tones, the better to skulk and hide with.

###### Combat

Unless special troops are present (p. XX), 50% of gangs or warbands encountered will be archers (round up), 50% will be warriors (round down). Goblin warriors are equipped with leather armor, spear, short sword, and shield. Goblin archers are equipped with scale armor, short bows, 20 arrows, and short sword. Some goblin tribes might field slingers instead of archers, equipped with leather armor, sling, short sword, and shield.

###### Ecology

Each goblin gang will be led by a champion with 3 AC, 1 HD, and 7 hp. Each goblin warband will be led by a sub-chieftain with 4 AC, 1+1 HD, 9 hp, and a +1 damage bonus. A goblin lair or village will be led by a chieftain with 5 AC, 3 HD, 16 hp, and a +2 damage bonus. As long as the chieftain is alive, the goblins will gain a +2 bonus to morale rolls.

Goblin lairs and villages will have drudges and whelps equal to 100% and 100% of the number of warriors respectively. Goblin drudges and whelps have Spd 60’, AC 0, 1 hp, ML -4, and do not fight.

When goblins are encountered in a village, certain additional creatures may be present. There is a 60% chance a goblin village will be guarded by 5d6 dire wolves. There is a 50% chance for 1d10 enslaved captives per warband. In addition, a village has a 75% chance of a shaman being present, and a 50% chance of a witch doctor. A shaman is equivalent to a sub-chieftain statistically, but has Shaman abilities at level 2d4. A witch doctor is equivalent to a champion statistically, but has Mage abilities at level 1d6.
