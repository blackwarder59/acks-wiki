### Galdrtré

Sometimes a tree sinks its roots deep into a place of power. Over the years, it drinks up the magic, which seeps into its very trunk and branches, giving it a strange sort of life. The Jutlanders call such a tree a galdrtré, and consider them sacred.

Galdrtré are sapient and communicative, but their voices are indistinguishable from leaves rustling or branches waving except to other plants or those able to *speak with plants.* They are wise in wood-lore and sometimes consulted by shamans.

###### Combat

At will, galdrtré can use a full-round action to wave its fronds and branches to cause an **enchanting whistle audible** at up to 180’ away. Any creature hearing the whistle must succeed on a Spells saving throw or become **enthralled** by the galdrtré until the end of the galdrtré’s next initiative.

Once per day, a galdrtré can use a full-round action to **summon a soporific mist** that surrounds itself in a 30’ radius. Any creature that begins its initiative in, or moves into, the area of effect must make a Paralysis save. If the save fails, the creature starts **slumbering**.If the save succeeds, the creature is not affected that round. The mist disperses after 1 turn unless dispersed by e.g. magic wind.

A galdrtré can attack targets up to 20’ away from its trunk using its twining roots and gnarled branches. If the galdrtré succeeds on an attack against a man-sized or smaller creature with an unmodified throw 20, it can pull the creature into **a gaping hollow** its trunk. A creature pulled into the hollow is immediately **stuck.** The stuck creature suffers 2d6 {B!} damage at the start of its initiative each round until it escapes or the galdrtré is destroyed.

If necessary, a galdrtré can tear itself from the ground and walk on its roots at the (slow) combat speed of 5’. However, the trees are loathe to leave and quick to return to the vicinity of the magic which animates them. A galdrtré loses 1 HD each hour it is absent from its source.

Galdrtré cultivate **bee-hives** within their branches. If the tree is disturbed, the bees will buzz out of the hive at the end of the tree’s next initiative to protect it. The bees form a 4 HD insect swarm. They will pursue enemies up to 150’ from the tree.

Galdrtré have tough bark that makes them **immune** to mundane piercing damage and **resistant** to extraordinary piercing damage. However, they are **susceptible** to fire damage.They save against fire at a-2 penalty and suffer double damage dice.

###### Ecology

If a galdrtré grove is encountered, there is a 5% for a galdrtré sapling to be present. Roll 1d20 for age: 1, baby, 2-20, juvenile. The grove will always be situated at an elemental place of power, sinkhole of evil, or pinnacle of good.
