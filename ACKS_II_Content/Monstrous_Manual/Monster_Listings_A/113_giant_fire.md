### Giant, Fire

Giants are mighty creatures that compare in stature to humans as humans compare to halflings. Unlike beastmen, ogres, and trolls, which were bred by the evil alchemy of the Zaharans, giants have existed since time immemorial, and not all giants are wicked. Some giants are more or less decent, and have even assisted adventurers from time to time in his various purposes. Most, however, are as cruel as they are stupid, and delight to eat the flesh of men.

Fire giants stand 18’ tall and weigh about 4,300lb. They have soot-colored skin with red eyes and hair. They commonly wear polished arena armor of brass, bronze, copper, or dragon-skin and carry great two-handed swords or spiked morning stars.

Giants of all types share a bombastic language. Fire giants also speak Common and Meniri Dwarven.

###### Combat

In combat, fire giants can smash with their fists or with weapons. When smashing with piercing or slashing weapons, giants deliver **vicious blows** that deal an additional 4 points per smash. When smashing with bludgeoning weapons, giants can **topple and fling** large or smaller creatures with every attack (p. XX). The creature struck must make a successful size-adjusted Paralysis saving throw or be knocked prone and forced back a number of feet equal to the damage dealt. The giant can cleave if the creature fails its save against his smash.

Instead of smashing, fire giants can **hurl boulders** to a distance of 1200’, dealing 3d6 {B!} damage in a 5’ radius to the impact point. When hurling a boulder, a giant functions like a heavy ballista using the rules for Missile Attacks with Artillery (***ACKS II RR****,* p. XX). However, the giant does not need to reload, so it can throw a boulder each round if it has sufficient ammo.

All fire giants are **immune** to fire damage.

###### Ecology

Fire giants live in large structures made of volcanic rock or dense fire-hardened earth in the Meniri Mountains. When fire giants are encountered in a dungeon lair or wilderness warband, they have a 25% chance to be accompanied by trained animals. When encountered in a wilderness lair, they are always accompanied by trained creatures. If trained creatures are present in a fire giant lair, roll 1d10 to determine type and number: 1-8, 2d4 greater hellhounds; 9-10, 1d3 12-headed hydras.

Adventurers usually encounter small bands of fire giants who have made their way into civilized realms to raid and plunder. Ancient Zaharan cuneiforms speak of a fire giant castle in a volcanic caldera deep in the Meniri Mountains ruled by a mighty king. This castle, if it exists, has never been found.
