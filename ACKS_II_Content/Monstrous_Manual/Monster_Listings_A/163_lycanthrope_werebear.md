### Lycanthrope, Werebear

Werebears are lycanthropes who can transform into cave bears. In their bear form they stand about 15’ tall and weigh over 1,000 lbs. In their human form they are typically quite hirsute with bulky torsos and long arms.

The Empyrean god Naurivus, Patron of Explorers, fastened the first werebears from a clan of warriors and woodsmen who volunteered to serve him. To ensure that the wilds would not be dominated by werewolves and their ilk, the god made the werebears the strongest of all lycanthropes.

Since werebears were created by an Empyrean god rather than a Chthonic one, they are untainted with supernatural evil. Like the humans they were made from, they can be of any alignment, though (again like humans) most are Neutral.

Werebears try to avoid infecting humans and demi-humans with their lycanthropy, so most werebears were born into their kind. From time to time, however, a werebear may transmit its disease by injury, either on purpose to a willing creature or by accident if forced to fight.

###### Combat

In beast form, werebears have **acute olfaction** and gain a +1 bonus to avoid surprise in its natural habitat. They can track the scent of creatures for up to 6 miles with the equivalent of three ranks of Tracking proficiency. They are also **skilled climbers**, able to ascend sheer surfaces as if they were thieves (6+).

If a werebear in beast form successfully attacks the same target with both claws in the same attack routine, it immediately **hugs** the target for an additional 2d8 {P!}damage. If the hug kills the target, the werebear can cleave with its claw.

###### Ecology

Werebears tend to be quite solitary, often dwelling alone or in small family groups. They tend to make their dens in caves or crude huts. When werebears are encountered in a wilderness lair, each werebear has a 25% chance to be accompanied by a sloth of 1d2 brown bears.

###### Spoils

A slain werebear can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the following components useful in magic research:

* blood (4 5/6 st, 285gp, *deflect ordinary weapons, skinchange*)
* scalp (4 5/6 st, 285gp, *slumber, transform beast*)

Because they revert to human form when slain, werebears cannot be harvested for claws, fangs, or fur.
