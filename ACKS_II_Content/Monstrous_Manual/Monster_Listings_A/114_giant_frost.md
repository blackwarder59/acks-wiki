### Giant, Frost

Giants are mighty creatures that compare in stature to humans as humans compare to halflings. Unlike beastmen, ogres, and trolls, which were bred by the evil alchemy of the Zaharans, giants have existed since time immemorial, and not all giants are wicked. Some giants are more or less decent, and have even assisted adventurers from time to time in his various purposes. Most, however, are as cruel as they are stupid, and delight to eat the flesh of men.

Frost giants are 17’ tall and weigh about 3,600lb. They have pale yellow or blue eyes, with white hair that can likewise be tinged with yellow or blue. They dress in thick furs of animals they have slain, and tend to fight with battle axes and spears.

Giants of all types share a bombastic language. Frost giants also speak Common and Jutting Dwarven.

###### Combat

In combat, frost giants can smash with their fists or with weapons. When smashing with piercing or slashing weapons, giants deliver **vicious blows** that deal an additional 4 points per smash. When smashing with bludgeoning weapons, giants can **topple and fling** large or smaller creatures with every attack (p. XX). The creature struck must make a successful size-adjusted Paralysis saving throw or be knocked prone and forced back a number of feet equal to the damage dealt. The giant can cleave if the creature fails its save against his smash.

Instead of smashing, frost giants can **hurl icy snowballs** to a distance of 1200’, dealing 3d6 {B!} {C!} damage in a 5’ radius to the impact point. When hurling a snowball, a giant functions like a heavy ballista using the rules for Missile Attacks with Artillery (***ACKS II RR****,* p. XX). However, the giant does not need to reload, so it can throw a boulder each round if it has sufficient ammo.

The icy conditions in which they dwell bother them not at all, for all frost giants are **immune** to cold damage.

###### Ecology

Frost giants live in frosty caverns and glacial rifts in the Jutting Mountains. When frost giants are encountered in a dungeon lair or wilderness warband, they have a 25% chance to be accompanied by trained animals. When encountered in a wilderness lair, they are always accompanied by trained creatures. If trained creatures are present in a frost giant lair, roll 1d10 to determine type and number: 1-8, 5d6 dire wolves; 9-10, 3d6 polar bears.

Adventurers usually encounter small bands of frost giants who have made their way into civilized realms to raid and plunder. Jutlandic skalds, however, sing songs of a great glacial rift ruled by a frost giant jarl or king who commands hundreds of giants and a wing of white dragons. Many great heroes have sought this fabled frost giant fortress, but none have returned.
