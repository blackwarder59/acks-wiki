### Hellhound, Greater

Greater hellhounds are cunning and intelligent canines that stand about 5’ tall at the shoulder and weigh about 1,350 to 1,400 lbs. Their coats are coal black while their eyes are blood red and smolder like coals. Iskara, mother of monsters, bred the greater hellhounds by infusing the ichor of efreeti pashas into the bodies of dire wolves.

Greater hellhounds are sapient creatures that are as intelligent as humans and demi-humans. They can speak the barking, baying language of hellhounds as well as the language(s) of any local beastmen and fire giants.

###### Combat

Like the wolves they were bred from, greater hellhounds have **acute hearing** and **acute olfaction.** They gain a +2 bonus to avoid surprise in their natural habitat. They can track the scent of creatures for up to 4 miles with the equivalent of two ranks of Tracking proficiency. Their keen senses enable them to **discern invisible** creatures and features within 60’.

In combat, greater hellhounds can either bite or breathe fire. The bite of a greater hellhound deals 2d6 {F!} {P!} damage. The **fiery breath** of a greater hellhound can affect one target within 15’. The affected creature must make a Blast saving throw. If the save fails, the creature suffers 7d6 {F!}damage. If the save succeeds, the creature suffers half that damage.

Greater hellhounds are **immune** to fire damage.

###### Ecology

Because of the efreeti ichor that courses through their veins, hellhounds delight in hot volcanic environments, especially places of power affiliated with the Elemental Sphere of Fire.

When greater hellhounds are encountered in a wilderness den, the hellhounds will be rearing 2d3 juveniles and 1d3 babies. Juvenile hellhounds have AC 3, Spd 90’, HD 3+2, and attack with a bite (1d3 {P}). Baby hellhounds have AC 2, Spd 90’, HD 2+1, and attack with 1 bite (1{P}). Hell hounds do not breathe fire until they reach sexual maturity.

###### Spoils

A slain greater hellhound can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the following components useful in magic research:

* teeth (8 2/6 st., 500gp, *fan of flames, fireball, fiery pillar, energy protection (fire), selective fire*
