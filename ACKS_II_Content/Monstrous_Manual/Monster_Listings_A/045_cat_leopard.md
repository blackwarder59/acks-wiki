### Cat, Leopard

Leopards are sleek ambush predators that can be found in the woodlands of Aurëpos and Danae and the savannahs of Ulruk. Leopards in warm regions have black and gold spotted coats, while those found in the snowy north have white and black spotted coats. Some leopards have pitch black fur; these are commonly called black panthers and are highly prized by the elves.

###### Combat

Leopards have **acute hearing** and **acute olfaction.** They gain a +2 bonus to avoid surprise in their natural habitat. They can track the scent of creatures for up to 4 miles with the equivalent of two ranks of Tracking proficiency.

They are **very agile** (as Acrobatics proficiency at 10+) and **superb climbers**, able to ascend sheer surfaces as if they were thieves (2+). They are also **adept at swimming** (as Swimming proficiency). Their **lightning reflexes** grant a +1 bonus to initiative. They are **naturally stealthy** when in their native habitat, and creatures encountering them suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls.

If a leopard charges a creature or leaps over it (using Acrobatics), and successfully hits it with both claws, it immediately **pounces** onthe creature. The leopard’s subsequent bite attack automatically hits and the creature that has been pounced on must make a successful size-adjusted Paralysis saving throw or be knocked **prone**.

###### Ecology

When leopards are encountered in a wilderness den, there is a 66% chance the leopards will be rearing leopards cubs. Roll 1d6 for age and number: 1-2 it’s 1d2 juvenile leopards, 3-6 it’s 1d4 baby panthers. Juvenile leopards have AC 2, Spd 150’, HD 2, and attack with 2 claws (1d2 {S}) and a bite (1d3 {P}). Baby leopards have AC 1, Spd 150’, HD 1+1, and attack with 2 scratches (1 {S}) and a fierce nibble (1 {P}).

###### Spoils

A slain leopard with exceptional attributes can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following components useful in magic research:

* heart (1 1/6 st, 70gp, *silent step, swift sword*)
* tongue (1 st, 65gp, *call of the great cats*)

A leopard's pelt fetches 35gp and weighs 5/6 st.

Leopards can be tamed and trained, but it is an uncommon practice in the Auran Empire. The elves, however, delight in training leopards, particularly black-furred specimens.

###### Encounter

Looming above the other nearby vegetation is a large, wide-trunked cypress tree, its leafy branches providing shade to the area around it. Lounging in its branches are a **leopard** and **four baby cubs**.
