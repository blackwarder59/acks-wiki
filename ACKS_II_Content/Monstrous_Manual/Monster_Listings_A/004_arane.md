### Arane

Arane resemble 8’ long jumping spiders. They weigh about 570 lbs, with have hairless, glossy, purple-black carapaces and an overlarge central pair of eyes surrounded by others. Although they may be mistaken for any giant spider, arane are anything but unthinking.

Sly, patient, and intelligent, the arane weave plots as deftly as they weave a web, and often work with others of their kind, surrounding themselves with frightened minions or others of a similarly wicked nature. The relationship between arane and attercops is not known to the sages of Aura. Some legends claim that the arane were once cultists of a demonic attercop who transformed themselves using foul alchemy to become more like their “god.”

Arane speak a dialect of Ancient Zaharan modified to accommodate their arachnid articulators.

###### Combat

Arane craftily place webs in strategic locations around their lairs. Any creature without a webcrawling speed that moves into the webs becomes **webbed**. The arane can detect vibrations caused by webbed creatures through their **webbed mechanoreception**.

Arane can also spray webbing up to 30’ to capture victims and keep them restrained for later consumption. These swift bursts of webbing can be released up to 3 times per day. The webbings cover a 10’-diameter area. Any creatures in the area must make Blast saving throws. If the save succeeds, the creature avoids the webbing, but must move out of the area on its next initiative or become affected. If the save fails, the creature becomes **webbed.**

The bite of an arane is **venomous**, and any creature bitten must make a Death saving throw. If the save succeeds, the creature is not affected by the venom. If the save fails, the creature dies in 1d4 turns.

20% of arane cast spells as mages of a level equal to their HD.

###### Ecology

When arane are encountered in their den, there will either be (90% chance) 1d2 juvenile arane or (10% chance) 1d2 arane eggs. Juvenile arane have AC 1, 3 HD, and 1 bite dealing 1d4 {P!} damage. The juvenile’s bites are not venomous. Arane eggs have 1 hp and weigh 1 st.

###### Spoils

A slain arane can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the following components useful in magic research:

* central eye pair (5 5/6 st, 350gp, *counterspell, discern magic, dispel magic*)
* mandibles (4 st, 240gp, *poison*)
* leg tarsus (4 st, 240gp, *levitation*)
