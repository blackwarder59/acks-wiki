### Bat, Giant Vampire

Giant vampire bats are huge demon-blooded bats descended from dakhanavar. They have 25’ wingspans and weigh 200 lbs. Giant vampire bats lurk in the same dark and high places that other bats favor.

Giant vampire bats are as intelligent as they are evil. They can speak their own language (which combines rhythmic chirps and trills with ultrasonic tones) as well as the dialect of any local beastmen.

###### Combat

If a vampire bat damages a creature with its bite, the vampire bat latches onto the creature and begins **draining blood**.Once latched on, the giant vampire bat can use its combat action to automatically deal another 2d4 {N}damage to the creature each round.

Creatures that are having their blood drained by a giant vampire bat can still move, but count as carrying 20 extra stone of encumbrance. The bat moves with the creature from which it is drinking blood.

Like other bats, giant vampire bats navigate and hunt with **echolocation** (540’ range). No spells or effects that would ordinarily blind a creature will affect a bat, but *inaudible* creatures are hidden from their echolocation, while *noiselessness* blinds it. Unlike other bats, however, giant vampire bats have **lightless vision** (60’) they can use when echolocation fails.

###### Ecology

Whenever giant vampire bats are encountered, each giant vampire bat has a 15% chance of carrying a bat pup. Roll 1d4 for age; 1-2 it’s a baby bat, 3-4 it’s a juvenile bat. Juvenile giant vampiric bats have AC 1, Spd 30’, HD 2, and 1 bite (1d3). Baby giant vampire bats have AC 0, HD 1+1, and 1 bite (1 piercing damage). Neither can drain blood.

###### Spoils

A slain giant vampire bat can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the following components useful in magic research:

* ears (1 st, 60gp, *inaudibility, noiselessness*)
* fangs (1 1/6 st, 75gp, *bloody flux*)
