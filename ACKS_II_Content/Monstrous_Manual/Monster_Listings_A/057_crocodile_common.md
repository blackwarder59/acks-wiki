### Crocodile, Common

Crocodiles are carnivorous reptiles that lurk in lake, rivers, swamps, and other shallow waters. While they breathe air, they spend most of their time submerged waiting for prey to come within reach. Crocodiles of the ordinary variety are found throughout southern Aurëpos and Ulruk. They are about 12’ long and weigh about 500 lbs.

###### Combat

Common crocodiles have **acute olfaction** and gain a +1 bonus to avoid surprise in its natural habitat. They are **naturally stealthy** when submerged, and creatures encountering them suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls.

###### Ecology

When common crocodiles are encountered in the wilderness, there is a 12% chance per crocodile that it will have 5d10 eggs buried nearby. Crocodile eggs have 1 hp and weigh 1/30 st.

###### Spoils

A slain crocodile with exceptional attributes can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following component:

* skull (2/6 st, 20gp, *swimming,* armor +1)

Crocodiles are both dull-witted and ill-tempered, making them difficult to train, though the smaller specimens are somewhat easier to work with.

###### Lore

*During our stay in Istakahr, the Hierophylax, Ashenmut , gave us a tour of the Royal Antiquarium, within which are kept some of the most ancient artifacts and antiquities in the world.*

*The south wing of the first floor of the Antiquarium ends in a colonnaded gallery known as the Zoaracade, and contains the petrified bones and preserved remains of animals and monstrosities collected from across Ithea, Ulruk, and Aurëpos.*

*Among this collection were the perfectly petrified bones of a crocodile, which Ashenmut said were tens of thousands of years older than any existing civilization in the world. When I asked the Hierophylax what evidence he had for such an outlandish claim, he guided me a number of broken clay tablets with indecipherable writing and strange pictographs of fantastical lizards.*

*These tablets, he explained, had been captured by the Zaharans when they overthrew the Thrassians, and they proved that that long before the Day Without Night, the world was dominated by reptile titans that strode across the continents like colossi. What we call the crocodile was the smallest and weakest of these prehistoric monstrosities.*
