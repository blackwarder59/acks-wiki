## Monster Parts (Special)

When a monster dies, a residue of its soul will linger in some its body parts, such as organs and bodily fluids. These body parts are known as **special components** and can be tapped by spellcasters to power the creation of magic items or the casting of ritual spells. Powerful mages and clerics often send parties of adventurers on quests to slay certain monsters and return with the monsters’ special components.

#### Identifying Special Components

Each species of monster has one or more body parts that typically house its spiritual residue after its death. Adventurers with Alchemy, Collegiate Wizardry, Magical Engineering, or Naturalism proficiency can identify which part(s) of a monster are typically special components. A proficiency throw of 14+ is required; the target value is reduced by 4 for each additional proficiency rank the character possesses in any of the appropriate proficiencies, to a minimum of 2+. If the throw fails, the adventurer is ignorant of the typical special component for that species. Adventurers with Loremastery can use it in addition to or in lieu of these proficiencies at the character’s unmodified target value.

EXAMPLE: The great sage Phimon has the following proficiencies: Alchemy 2, Collegiate Wizardry, and Magical Engineering. He therefore has three additional ranks in the proficiencies used to identify special components. He can identify which parts of a monster are usually special component on a proficiency throw of 2+.

Sometimes a monster’s spiritual residue might reside in an unusual organ or fluid due to the manner of the creature’s death, the alignment of the spheres, or other arcane factors. Roll 1d20; on a natural 20, the creature has an unusual special component or components of your choice.

Spellcasters with the ability to discern magic (through a proficiency, class power, or spell) can determine the exact special component(s) of a particularslain monster. Such spellcasters can also inspect monster parts presented to them to assess whether they are, indeed, special components. The presence of spiritual residue is subtle, so the determination takes one turn and requires a magic research throw. If the throw fails, the spellcaster has not been able to glean any information. The spellcaster can try again every turn, if desired, for as long as he can discern magic.

EXAMPLE: One of Moruvai’s minions presents him with the stomach of a polar bear, claiming it is rich with residual energies. Moruvai casts discern magic and inspects the hide for one turn (10 minutes). His magic research throw succeeds, and the ruinguard learns that the stomach has no value as a special component whatsoever. Was his minion negligent in storing the stomach, or was this attempted deceit? Moruvai has ways of making him talk…

#### Harvesting Special Components

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Special Component Type** | **Ruinous Effects** |
| Appendage (claw, tentacle, teeth, etc.) | *disintegration;* any area of effect damage |
| Bones (femur, jawbone, etc.) | *disintegration*; any blunt weapon damage |
| Covering (feather, fur, hair, etc.) | *disintegration;* any area of effect damage |
| Exterior organ (eyes, scrotum, etc.) | *disintegration;* any area of effect damage |
| Internal organ (heart, kidney, etc.) | *disintegration*; poison |
| Remnant (ectoplasm, slag, residue, etc.) | *disintegration* |

Special components can only be harvested if they are captured intact. Components will be intact provided the monster was not damaged by an effect that ruins that type of component, as shown on the accompanying table.

###### Permanent Wounds and Harvesting (Optional Rule)

Roll on the Mortal Wounds table when a monster is slain to assess whether the monster’s special components are intact. Select the Timing modifier based on when the adventurers harvest the monster’s component (typically after the fight). Apply the treatment modifier if the adventurer harvesting the component has the prerequisite proficiency to harvest it (see below). If the special component is damaged or destroyed by a permanent wound, it cannot be harvested. An “instant kill” result (0 or less on the d20) means that all the monster’s special components were destroyed.

EXAMPLE: The Claws of the Lioness are hunting giant hawks in order to harvest their eyes*.* They have just reduced a giant hawk to -8 hp from its maximum of 12 hp. As soon as the fight ends, a hireling with Animal Husbandry approaches the fallen hawk to harvest its eyes. The Judge rolls on the appropriate Mortal Wounds table for the giant hawk. He rolls a 10 on 1d20 and a 2 on 1d6. The d20 modifier is -5 (negative hp value of ½ max or more), +2 (Animal Husbandry), -3 (immediately after the fight), for -6 total, reducing the d20 roll to 4.

Cross-referencing 4 and 2 on the Mortal Wounds table, the Judge sees that the giant hawk has been blinded, so its eyes cannot be harvested. Its other special component (flight feathers) are intact and can still be harvested, however. If the modified d20 roll had been 0 or less, none of the hawk’s components would be intact.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Monster Type** | **Prerequisite Proficiencies** |
| Animal | Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery), or Trapping |
| Beastmen | Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 2 (combined ranks) |
| Construct | Magical Engineering |
| Giant | Healing |
| Humanoid | Healing |
| Incarnation | Alchemy 2 |
| Monstrosity | Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) |
| Oozes | Alchemy |
| Undead | Alchemy 2 (incorporeal) or Healing 2 (corporeal) |
| Vermin | Animal Husbandry 2 |

###### Harvesting with Proficiencies

Appendages, external organs, and remnants can be harvested by any adventurer. It requires one turn and no special proficiency to do so.

Bones, coverings, internal organs, and more exotic special components can only be harvested by characters with the prerequisite proficiencies shown on the adjoining table. Characters must have the appropriate craftsman’s tools for the proficiency used and spend one turn per 100gp value of the component (minimum one turn).

EXAMPLE: Yrsa has slain a harpy and wishes to harvest its vocal cords (65gp value). Vocal cords are an internal organ, so there is a proficiency prerequisite. Harpies are monstrosities, so Yrsa must have a combination of three ranks in Animal Husbandry or Healing proficiency to perform the delicate extraction. Yrsa has three ranks of Healing proficiency, so she qualifies. It takes her one turn to harvest the vocal cords.

#### Storing Special Components

Special components are fragile, as the residual energies are prone to dissolving once disturbed. If a corpse is moved before its special components are extracted, its special components have a cumulative 10% chance per 100’ the corpse is moved of losing their value. Once a special component has been extracted, it will lose its value in one turn unless placed inside a special alchemical jar known as a **metamphora**. Special components inside metamphora can be moved and stored safely. Note that special components generally weigh very little; the encumbrance from special components is from the metamphora needed to preserve them.

**Metamphora:** Designed to store special components, metamphora are ceramic jars inscribed with alchemical sigils and stoppered with copper seals. Metamphora come in an array of different sizes and shapes, as more valuable special components require sturdier, stronger metamphora to prevent leakage. Metamphora cost 5gp and weigh 1 stone for every 60gp of value they store.

#### Value and Encumbrance of Special Components

The Monster Special Components tables on the following pages catalog the special components of frequently-hunted monsters, along with each entry’s associated encumbrance and value, and the suggested spell effects the special components might correlate with. Unlisted monsters are left to your discretion.

With rare exceptions, a monster’s special components have an aggregate gp value equal to the monster’s XP value. The encumbrance of special components is assumed to be equal to that of the metamphora required to transport them, 1 stone per 60gp value.

Some entries represent groups of monsters of varying Hit Dice or abilities. The spell effects associated with such entries might be subjected to restrictions that limit them to particular sub-sets of the entry. Any such restrictions are called out with brackets.

EXAMPLE: The entry “animals, ordinary” covers all ordinary animals – bears, dogs, horses, etc. The associated spell effects for “animals, ordinary” are “*bewitch beast* [2HD+], *summon animal* [4 HD+]*,* and *predict weather.”* The restriction “[2 HD+]” means that an ordinary animal’s special component is only associated with *bewitch beast* if the animal has at least 2 HD or more.

###### Default Effects

Each monster type (animal, beastman, etc.) has one or more default spell effects associated with it. Each and every special component harvested from a monster can be used for magical research relating to the default spell effects for its type.

###### Great-Souled Creatures

Lawful monsters with innate divine magic (such as herald angels, lammasu, or unicorns) are exceptionally valuable sources of power. Their special components are worth 10 times their XP value. Killing such a great-souled creature is, of course, a horribly Chaotic act.

###### Ordinary Animals

Most animals are so embedded in the cycle of life that their spiritual residue disperses almost immediately. They cannot be harvested for special components. Only animals of unusual size, stature, or other characteristics can be harvested. In game terms, this includes dire animals, giant animals, and prehistoric animals, as well as any animals with total ability modifiers of +3 or more. The latter are often found as pack leaders, herd “alphas,” and so on.

EXAMPLE**:** While visiting the fortress of Türos Tem, Yrsa notices that the legate’s medium war horse, Unconquered Sun, is quite exceptional, with the equine equivalent of DEX 15 and CON 16. While an ordinary war horse could not be harvested for special components, Unconquered Sun could be.

###### Summoned Creatures

Creatures summoned temporarily with spells or scrolls can never be harvested for special components. Creatures which have voluntarily entered this sphere of existence, become permanently bound to this sphere of existence, or been slain in their own sphere of existence can always be fully harvested. Casters who have studied this phenomenon believe there may be some balancing force built into the Logos that maintains spiritual flows across the spheres.

###### Mundane Market Value

In some cases, a monster part has value both as a non-magical trade good and as a special component. If the special component value is only a fraction of the mundane value, then only that fraction of the monster part is needed for the special component. The remainder of the part may be sold for a sum equal to its mundane value less its special component value. However, if the special component value is equal or greater than the mundane value, then all of the part is needed as a component.

###### Young and Weak Monsters

The spiritual residue of young and/or weak monsters quickly dissipates. Baby, juvenile, and adolescent monsters cannot be harvested for special components except in special circumstances (Judge’s discretion). Monsters that do not fight (such as goblin dredges) also cannot be harvested for special components, nor can monsters with less than ½ HD.

#### Expanding and Modifying Special Component Lists

The Monster Special Component lists are intended to be suggestive, not restrictive. Not every spell or effect in *ACKS* is included, nor is every monster. You should freely expand and modify the list to accommodate your own campaign setting. The following guidelines are intended to assist, not straightjacket, you in this regard.

###### Number of Special Components

Monsters with a broad array of special abilities tend to have their spiritual residue spread across a number of different special components. Each creature should be assigned a minimum of one special component. If the monster is capable of carrying a man-sized rider in flight, it should be assigned an additional special component. If the monster has at least 4 HD and three or more attacks per round, it should be assigned an additional special component. Finally, for each asterisk (special ability), the monster should assigned an additional special component. However, creatures whose substance is purely artificial, elemental, incorporeal, or ooze should always be assigned just one special component (usually some variation of blood or residue).

###### Selection of Associated Effects

In selecting the particular associations between monsters and spells, we were inspired by the historical laws of magic. The “law of correspondence” suggested that creatures should be associated with their own special abilities. Thus, invisible stalkers are associated with *invisibility,* while basilisks are associated with *petrification.*

The “law of similarity” suggested that creatures be associated with spells that imitate or resemble their own behaviors or abilities. Purple worms are associated with *earth’s movement* and *passwall* because they burrow through the earth. Basilisks are associated with *hypnotic sigil* because in both cases gazing results in helplessness for the victim.

The similarities are sometimes tied to folklore about the creature. Thus animals are associated with *predict weather* because folklore claims animals can do just that. (In-world, of course, the causality might run the other way: Folklore might claim animals can predict the weather becausemages use them as components to do that.)

The “law of polarity” suggested that creatures could be associated with spells that oppose their own behaviors or abilities. Bats, which rely on echolocation, are thus associated with *noiselessness.*

The “law of contagion” suggested that creatures be associated with spells that control, contact, or summon their type. Thus all undead are associated with *control undead*.

More powerful spell effects include lesser effects of the same name (e.g. *bewitch monster* includes *bewitch humanoid*).

###### Limitation on Common Effects

Because certain special abilities are exceptionally common, such as flight, infravision, and water breathing, use the following rules-of-thumb to further limit the number of associations. In most cases, creatures should be associated with *winged flight* only if their wings are unnatural additions to their body form, and with *flight* only if they are capable of carrying a man-sized rider. Creatures should be associated with *lightless vision* only if they have exceptional range of sight (90’+). Creatures should be associated with *water breathing* only if it is unnatural to the body form.

###### Number of Associated Effects

The total number of associated spell effects per monster should be capped at the greater of Hit Dice or number of special components. If necessary, the number of special components determined above can be adjusted one or two in either direction if that helps accommodate your desired assortment of associated effects. +1 weapon and armor bonuses count as one effect, +2 weapon and armor bonuses count as three effects, and +3 weapon and armor bonuses count as six effects.

**Note:** The rules for special components elaborated here were developed around the assumptions of its implied setting. The summary below should provide sufficient context for Judges to make sense of the mechanics and expand them for their own use.

In the Auran Empire, every living creature hosts within itself a shard of divine power called a soul. The ability of physical matter to host a soul is dependent on its configuration and properties - its *form* in classical parlance. Death results when the physical form becomes so damaged or decrepit that it can no longer contain a complete soul. When this occurs, the soul transmigrates to a new form which can contain it. This process is called reincarnation or *metempsychosis*.Complete reincarnation does not occur immediately, however. When a living creature dies, a residue of its soul may remain coagulate within the body for a time, only gradually dissipating from its corpse.

It is this residue of the soul that a spellcaster speaks with when using *speak with dead*. And it is this residue of the soul that makes the organs and blood of creatures valuable as special components. How much of a residual soul remains depends on many factors. How intact is the body? The more intact the body, the more residue of the soul will remain. How powerful was the deceased? More powerful souls tend to linger longer. What is the alignment of the spheres of existence? The more distant the outer spheres, the longer a soul will linger. How long has the creature been dead? The more time has elapsed, the less divine power will remain.

In game terms, the total amount of divine power possessed by a creature is equal to ten times its XP value. When a creature dies, about 90% of this value typically transmigrates very rapidly; the other 10% remains as a residue within the creature’s blood or organs, which can be harvested as special components for magical research. When a creature is sacrificed, 80% of its divine power passes to the entity worshipped, 10% is retained by the sacrificier for his own ends, and 10% remains residual within its blood and organs. This is why XP value = special component value = sacrifice value.

A living creature bleeds off divine power each day equal to 6% of its XP value. Casters use some of this to fuel their spells, but the rest is dissipated or bequeathed to a god through worship. A cleric that leads a congregant in worship collects about 10% while the god collects the rest – which is why 50 0-level congregants (worth 5xp each) generate (5 x 50 x 6% x 10% x 7) 10gp worth of divine power for their cleric.

Sages theorize that living creatures recover the power they bleed off biologically, by means of ingesting food, and that the reason undead “feed” is similar. In any case, a truly dead creature’s divine power simply bleeds off without means of recovery. To prevent this, monster parts containing divine power must be stored in special containers.
