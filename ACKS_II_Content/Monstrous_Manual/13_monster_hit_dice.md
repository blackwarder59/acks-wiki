## Monster Hit Dice

Hit Dice are an abstract measure of a monster’s fighting ability and toughness. The weakest monsters have less than 1 HD, while the most powerful have 36 HD or more. Hit Dice affect a monster’s hit points, size category, armor class, attack throws, saving throws, damage, experience point value, treasure type.

**Bonus Hit Points:** Some monsters may have a bonus of one or more hit points applied to their Hit Dice. These monsters have a Hit Die listing such as “1+1” or “4+2”. Each bonus point counts as 0.25 Hit Dice for purposes such as calculating monster weight, armor class, carrying capacity, and damage.
