# Chapter 2: Monster Listings

### Acanthaspis, Giant

The giant acanthaspis, also known as the giant assassin bug, is a horrific predator with a taste for fresh meat. When full grown, it measures about 10' long and weighs about 800 lbs, with six legs and a short segmented beak. The beak injects acidic enzymes into the bug’s victims, digesting them from the inside so their liquified innards can be sucked out like milk.

###### Combat

After killing a victim, the acanthaspis secures the corpse on its glossy black carapace with sticky secretions, wearing its victims as **corpse** **armor.** When first encountered, an acanthaspis will have secured 2d10 corpses to itself. Each corpse can absorb 1hp of damage before being destroyed. It takes 1 turn for an acanthaspis to secure a new corpse to itself.

When an acanthaspis successfully bites a creature, the creature struck must make a Paralysis saving throw. If the save succeeds, the attack deals 3d6 {P!} damage but has no other effect. If the save fails, the attack deals 3d6 {P!} damage and the creature is **grabbed**. The acanthaspis immediately injects the grabbed creature with digestive enzymes that deal 1d4 {A!} damage. While the creature remains grabbed, the acanthaspis can use its combat action to automatically deal another 1d4 {A!} damage to the creature each round. Once the acidic damage reduces the grabbed creature to 0 or fewer hp, the acanthaspis immediately sucks out its melted innards, killing it instantly.

If desperate or frustrated, an acanthaspis can spew a 30’ x 5’ line of **acidic spit**. Any creature in the area of effect must make a Blast saving throw. If the save fails, the creature takes 4d8 {A!} damage. If the save succeeds, it takes half that damage. One such attack depletes the acanthaspis’s acid supply for 6 hours, so it will only spit acid when reduced to fewer than half its hit points or when it has failed to grab an opponent.

###### Ecology

When acanthaspis are encountered in a wilderness nest, there is a 25% chance per creature that it will have 1d4 eggs buried nearby. Acanthaspis eggs have 1 hp and weigh 4/6 st. Acanthaspis nymphs are rarely found in nests, because the nymphs immediately disperse into the wild after they emerge from their eggs.

###### Spoils

A slain acanthaspis can be harvested with Animal Husbandry 2 for the following components useful in magic research:

* acid gland (4 2/6 st, 260gp, *rain of vitriol, vitriolic infusion*)
* antennae (2 st, 120gp, *locate animal/plant, locate object*)
* mandible (2 st, 120gp, *choking grip, halt humanoid*)

If not used for magic research, an acanthaspis’s mandibles fetch 18gp and weigh 2/6 st. Its armored hide fetches 80gp and weighs 2 1/6 st.

### Amphisbaena

Among the most perilous of desert denizens, amphisbaena are the offspring of an escaped sorcerous creation of times gone by, great snakes 30’ long with heads at each end of their sinuous bodies. An amphisbaena winds its intricately-patterned sand-colored body sideways across the sand, each head leading by turn, leaving great twisting tracks in its wake as it seeks prey to sate its appetite. Desert nomads claim the flesh of an amphisbaena is a potent aphrodisiac, and the monsters are frequently hunted for their components.

###### Combat

An amphisbaena attacks with two **venomous** bites, one from each, dealing 1d4 {!P} damage each. Any creature damaged by an amphisbaena’s bite must make a Death saving throw. If the save fails, the creature dies of poison 1d4+2 turns later.

An amphisbaena’s heads are rivalrous and actively struggle to keep prey away from the other head. Should both heads latch on to the same target, this can have disastrous consequences. If an amphisbaena successfully attacks the same target with both bites in the same attack routine, the struggle between the two heads **rends** the target for an additional 2d10 {Se!} damage. If this damage reduces the target to 0 hp or less, the target is torn limb from limb and instantly slain. The amphisbaena can cleave after rending a target with whichever bite dealt more damage.

In addition to biting prey, an amphisbaena can attack by constriction. A successful constriction attack deals 2d8 {B!} damage to the creature and **restrains** it. Thereafter, while the creature remains restrained, the amphisbaena can automatically deal 2d8 {B!} damage on its initiative each round to the restrained creature without having to make an attack throw. Doing so counts as the amphisbaena’s constriction attack.

###### Ecology

When amphisbaena are encountered in their dens, there is a 7% chance per amphisbaena that it is incubating 2d4 eggs. Amphisbaena eggs have 1 hp and weigh 1/6 st.

###### Spoils

A slain amphisbaena can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the following components useful in magic research:

* 2 fangs (4 st, 240gp, *poison, neutralize poison*)
* 2 spines (4 st, 240gp, *choking grip, iron maiden*)
* hunk of flesh (5 4/6 st, 340gp, *allure, enslave humanoid*)

If not used for magic research, an amphisbaena’s fangs fetch 4gp and weigh 1/6 st. Its venom (onset time 1d10 turns, +2 saving modifier, target suffers 4d4 {Po} damage on a failed Death saving throw) fetches 200gp and weighs 1/6 st.

### Ant, Giant

Which foul demon or mad sorcerer first bred ants of gigantic size is unknown to even the wisest sages of Aura, but all agree that it was a terrible mistake. Adaptable, implacable, and omnivorous, giant ants are a scourge that can reduce a fertile field or woodland to a wasteland in a day.

Like their diminutive cousins, ants are divided into castes of workers, soldiers, and queens. Workers are about 5' long and weigh about 150 lbs. Soldiers are about 6’ to 7’ long and weigh approximately 250 lbs. Queens are immense, measuring 7’ to 9’ long and weighing about 400 lbs.

###### Combat

Giant ants are not aggressive unless their nests are invaded. In that case, the ants are automatically Hostile and gain a +4 bonus to morale rolls provided their queen is still alive.

They use **terrestrial mechanoreception** to sense vibration in the ground over long distances equivalent to line of sight in full daylight. Spells or effects that would ordinarily cause blindness do not affect the ant when its using terrestrial mechanoreception. However, creatures that are flying, levitating, or otherwise not touching the ground are invisible to the sense. Terrestrial mechanoreception can penetrate structures and terrain features.

###### Ecology

Most giant ants are workers, but for every 5 workers there will be one soldier. When giant ants are encountered in their nest, there will always be one queen guarded by 2d4 additional soldiers. There will also be 3d10 larvae and 2d6 eggs. Larva have AC 4, Spd 150’, HD 2, and attack with 1 bite (1d6 {P}). Eggs have 1 hp and weigh 2/6 st. Roll 1d20 per egg: 1 – queen egg, 2-6 soldier egg, 7+, worker ant egg.

###### Spoils

Giants ants tend to have incidental treasure around their nests, left over from past opponents, but in some rare instances giant ants will inexplicably mine precious metals. Mining will be evident in 5% of nests, where there will be as much as 1d10x1000 gold pieces worth of raw gold nuggets. At the Judge’s discretion, a giant ant nest can be treated as a gold vein (see ***By This Axe*** for details).

A slain worker ant can be harvested with Animal Husbandry 2 for the following components useful in magic research:

* antennae (4/6 st., 40gp, *locate treasure*)
* chitinous plates (4/6 st., 40gp, armor +1, weapon +1)

A slain soldier can be harvested for components worth and weighing 250% more (1 4/6 st, 100gp). A slain queen can be harvested for components worth and weighing 400% more (4 st., 160gp).

### Arane

Arane resemble 8’ long jumping spiders. They weigh about 570 lbs, with have hairless, glossy, purple-black carapaces and an overlarge central pair of eyes surrounded by others. Although they may be mistaken for any giant spider, arane are anything but unthinking.

Sly, patient, and intelligent, the arane weave plots as deftly as they weave a web, and often work with others of their kind, surrounding themselves with frightened minions or others of a similarly wicked nature. The relationship between arane and attercops is not known to the sages of Aura. Some legends claim that the arane were once cultists of a demonic attercop who transformed themselves using foul alchemy to become more like their “god.”

Arane speak a dialect of Ancient Zaharan modified to accommodate their arachnid articulators.

###### Combat

Arane craftily place webs in strategic locations around their lairs. Any creature without a webcrawling speed that moves into the webs becomes **webbed**. The arane can detect vibrations caused by webbed creatures through their **webbed mechanoreception**.

Arane can also spray webbing up to 30’ to capture victims and keep them restrained for later consumption. These swift bursts of webbing can be released up to 3 times per day. The webbings cover a 10’-diameter area. Any creatures in the area must make Blast saving throws. If the save succeeds, the creature avoids the webbing, but must move out of the area on its next initiative or become affected. If the save fails, the creature becomes **webbed.**

The bite of an arane is **venomous**, and any creature bitten must make a Death saving throw. If the save succeeds, the creature is not affected by the venom. If the save fails, the creature dies in 1d4 turns.

20% of arane cast spells as mages of a level equal to their HD.

###### Ecology

When arane are encountered in their den, there will either be (90% chance) 1d2 juvenile arane or (10% chance) 1d2 arane eggs. Juvenile arane have AC 1, 3 HD, and 1 bite dealing 1d4 {P!} damage. The juvenile’s bites are not venomous. Arane eggs have 1 hp and weigh 1 st.

###### Spoils

A slain arane can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the following components useful in magic research:

* central eye pair (5 5/6 st, 350gp, *counterspell, discern magic, dispel magic*)
* mandibles (4 st, 240gp, *poison*)
* leg tarsus (4 st, 240gp, *levitation*)
* spinneret (4 st, 240gp, *webbing*)

Arane mages can also be harvested for a luminous gland (500gp, *all enchantment spells*).

### Attercop, Demonic

The mother of monsters, called Iskara by the Aurans, created the demonic attercops by infusing cacodemon ichor into the bodies of giant spiders. These hell-spawned arachnids measure 12’ long with legs tipped with iron-hard claws that stretch to 9’ and bodies weighing a titanic 2,300 lbs. They dwell in the fetid swamps, dark forests, and high mountains of the wild.

Demonic attercops are nowadays very rare, but they have spawned many children: All of the various lesser attercops are descended, by way of repeated mating with giant spiders, from the demonic attercop.

Attercops are sapient and speak their own horrific language. Scholars who have studied Ancient Zaharan, Khepri, and Thrassian find certain similarities in the attercop tongue.

###### Combat

Demonic attercops are ambush predators, and creatures encountering attercops suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls due to the spiders’ **natural stealth**.

A demonic attercop **is dreadful** to confront.A creature which starts its initiative, or moves within, 60’ of a demonic attercop must make a Paralysis saving throw. If the save succeeds, the creature gains immunity to the effects of every attercop’s dreadfulness for 1 turn. If the save fails, the creature starts **faltering.** If the creature was already faltering, it becomes **frightened** instead. The faltering or frightened condition ends if removed magically or if the demonic attercop is destroyed or no longer within 60’.

To aid in ambush, demonic attercops spin webs in strategic locations around their lairs. They use these webs to entangle victims in their webs in order to capture them and keep them fresh for later consumption. They can also spin a web around a target as a melee attack. If a creature moves into an attercop’s web, or if an attercop succeeds on a webspinning attack throw against a creature, that creature becomes **webbed.**

A demonic attercop’s **webbed mechanoreception** enables it to “see” any creatures touching their webs.

A demonic attercop can attack by spinning a web (above), biting, or goring with its great horns. If it bites its target, it deals 4d10 {P!} damage and injects a **deadly** **venom**. A creature damaged by an attercop’s bite must make a Death saving throw at -4. If the save succeeds, the creature is not affected by the venom. If the save fails, then creature suffers 10d6 {Po!} damage and becomes **paralyzed** for 2d4 turns at the end of the attercop’s initiative. The paralysis can be cured by *neutralize poison* but not *cure light injury.* When the paralysis wears off, the poisoned creature is **fatigued**. The fatigue ends if the poison is neutralized or after the creature enjoys 8 hours of restful sleep.

If it gores its target, it deals 2d10 {P!} damage per horn. If at least one horn hits, the target must make a successful size-adjusted Paralysis save or be knocked prone.

If both horns hit, the target is automatically knocked **prone**. If the target is knocked prone, the demonic attercop can then either make a bite attack or make 4 attacks with its clawed legs, each dealing 2d10 {S!} damage on a successful hit.

Demonic attercops have many-layered hides that make them **immune** to mundane physical damage. When damaged, demonic attercops **brood in darkness**,regenerating 3 hp per round provided that they remain stationary and are not exposed to any light. They can even regenerate lost limbs or eyes, given sufficient time.

###### Ecology

Demonic attercops can reproduce with other attercops as well as with the various species of giant spider. When encountered in a wilderness lair, there is a 5% chance the demonic attercop is watching over a clutch of eggs. The nature and number of these eggs will depend on the species with which the she copulated. Roll 1d10 to find out: 1, another attercop; 2-4, a giant tarantula; 5-7, a giant black widow; 8-10, a giant crab spider.

If the mother bred with any other attercop, she’ll have lain 1 demonic attercop egg. If the mother bred with a giant tarantula, she’ll have lain 1d4 monstrous attercop eggs; if with a giant black widow, 4d6 hideous attercop eggs; and if with a giant crab spider, 6d6 foul attercop eggs. Demonic attercop eggs have 1 hp and weigh 4 st each. (See the other attercop entries for the smaller eggs.)

Normally the spiderlings disperse upon hatching, but the demonic influence of the attercop sometimes causes them to lair nearby, creating a fell region infested with arachnids.

###### spoils

A slain demonic attercop can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the following components useful in magic research:

* carapace (15 st, 900gp, *physical invulnerability (all), tenebrosity*)
* horns (15st, 900gp, *cone of fear, inspire horror, panic*)
* mandibles (11 st, 650gp, *poison*)
* leg tarsus (10 st, 600gp, *spider climb*)
* spinneret (10 st, 600gp, *chameleon, webbing*)

If not used for magic research, a demonic attercop’s mandibles fetch 40gp and weigh 4/6 st. Its venom (onset time 1 round, no saving modifier, paralysis for 1d4 turns and 5d6 {Po} damage on failed Death saving throw) fetches 1,000gp and weighs 1/6 st.

###### Encounter

A Zaharan temple portico has been carved into the face of a rocky cliff at an elevation of some 100’. An entryway, visible as a black silhouette from ground level, suggests there is a rock-cut interior within. A narrow rubble-strewn trail (which requires a balancing traverse to ascend) slowly winds a 200’ course upward to the portico.

Adventurers who ascend to investigate discover that the temple portico once carried bas-relief engravings, now difficult to decipher because of age and erosion – all that remains visible is a cluster of stone spheres, two large and six small, arranged in pairs.

The rock-cut temple inside has a left-right width of 60’ and a length longer than torchlight can reveal (75’), such that rear of the temple shrouded in darkness.

In the darkness lurks Uttu, one of the last of the demonic attercops created by Iskara before the Day Without Night. Uttu rests upon a pyramid of bones built from her victims over the years, the whole bound together with webbing to form a bed for her great bulk. Uttu’s dreadful aura extends out 60’, so any adventurer who moves more than 15’ into the temple must immediately begin to make Paralysis saves.

**Demonic Attercop:** Spd 60’ / 120’ web, AC 10, HD 10\*\*\*\*, hp 55, #AT 1 (bite or web 1+) or 2 (horns 1+), Dmg 4d20 {P!} + poison, web, or 2d10 {P!}, Save F10, ML +1, AL C, XP 3,650; Special: dreadful, knockdown, regeneration, immunity

Uttu’s treasure is hidden within the sticky webbed bone pyramid of her fallen victims. Removing the treasure from the webbing by hand is a pain-staking process that will require 8 man-hours. Adventurers who burn off the webs can retrieve the treasure in 1 man-hour, but burning the webs destroys the scrolls in the hoard.

The treasure consists of 4,000ep; 4,000gp; a wrought silver signet ring (500gp); a pair of wrought bronze bulls (100gp each); a pair of chryselephantine statuettes of Iskara (700gp each); a crown of wrought orichalcum with thousands of tiny diamonds (4,000gp); a **wand of thunderbolts**(appears as a short stick with wavering grooves down its length, 12 charges); a **potion of adjust self**(slowly changes hue each turn); a **potion of vigor** (silver tint, euphoric sensation when tasted); a bronzewood scroll box containing a **scroll of magic warding**,scroll of demon warding, **scroll of discern magic**, and scroll of **banner of invincibility and passageway**; a pouch with **dust of revelation** (14 pinches, no apparent value); a stitched leather quiver with **17 arrows +3** (fletched of dawn redwood with eagle feathers), a **battle axe +1** (double-bladed dwarven bearing the sigil of Azen Khador); and, lastly, a set of two backwards-curved elven short swords with pommels carved in the shape of a great dawn redwood.

The first sword in the set is a **short sword +1, +3 vs. undead**. Its blade is carved with runes of law and luminous power. The second sword is a **short sword +1, +3 vs. beastmen**; its blade is carved with runes of smiting and vengeance. A successful Loremastery proficiency throw identifies these weapons as *Dorn na Marbh* (“doom to the dead”) and *Dorn na Beithíoch* (“doom to the beastly”), famously wielded by the elven hero Caoimhin ua Orthanach, who disappeared in an expedition in 184 IY.

### Attercop, Foul

Foul attercops are remote relatives of the demonic attercops, the demonic ichor having greatly weakened through hundreds of generations of breeding with giant spiders of the mortal sort. These creatures are 5’ long and weigh about 125 lbs. Like their progenitors, these arachnid horrors dwell in the fetid swamps, dark forests, and high mountains of the wild.

Attercops are sapient and speak their own horrific language. Scholars who have studied Ancient Zaharan, Khepri, and Thrassian find certain similarities in the attercop tongue.

###### Combat

Foul attercops are ambush predators, and creatures encountering attercops suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls due to the spiders’ **natural stealth**.

Their bites carry a dangerous **paralytic venom.** A creature damaged by a foul attercop’s bite must make a Death saving throw with a +2 bonus. If the save succeeds, the creature is not affected by the venom. If the save fails, then creature suffers 2d6 {P} damage and becomes **paralyzed** for 2d4 turns at the end of the attercop’s initiative. The paralysis can be cured by *neutralize poison* but not *cure light injury.* When the paralysis wears off, the poisoned creature is **fatigued**. The fatigue ends if the poison is neutralized or after the creature enjoys 8 hours of restful sleep.

To aid in ambush, attercops spin webs in strategic locations around their lairs. They use these webs to entangle victims in their webs in order to capture them and keep them fresh for later consumption. They can also spin a web around a target as a melee attack. If a creature moves into an attercop’s web, or if an attercop succeeds on a webspinning attack throw against a creature, that creature becomes **webbed.**

The foul attercops’ **webbed mechanoreception** enables them to “see” any creatures touching their webs.

###### Ecology

Foul attercops can reproduce with any other attercops; the mother determines the resultant offspring. When encountered in a den, there is a 10% chance per foul attercop that it will be guarding a clutch of 2d4 eggs. Foul attercop eggs have 1 hp and weigh 1/6 st.

###### Spoils

A slain foul attercop can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the following components useful in magic research:

* mandibles (1/6 st, 12gp, *poison*)
* leg tarsus (1/6 st, 12gp, *spider climb*)
* spinneret (2/6 st, 16gp, *chameleon, webbing*)

If not used for magic research, a foul attercop’s mandibles fetch 8gp and weigh 1/6 st. Its venom (onset time of 1 turn, +6 saving modifier, paralysis for 1d4 turns and 1d6 {Po} damage on failed Death saving throw) fetches 125gp and weighs 1/6 st.

### Attercop, Hideous

Hideous attercops are the distant descendants of the demonic attercops, the demonic ichor having somewhat thinned over the course of multiple generations of breeding with giant spiders of the mortal sort. A hideous attercop is about 6’ long and corpulent with chitin and venom, weighing 240 lbs. Like their progenitors, these arachnid horrors dwell in the fetid swamps, dark forests, and high mountains of the wild.

Attercops are sapient and speak their own horrific language. Scholars who have studied Ancient Zaharan, Khepri, and Thrassian find certain similarities in the attercop tongue.

###### Combat

Hideous attercops are ambush predators, and creatures encountering attercops suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls due to the spiders’ **natural stealth**.

Their bites carry a dangerous **paralytic venom.** A creature damaged by a hideous attercop’s bite must make a Death saving throw. If the save succeeds, the creature is not affected by the venom. If the save fails, then creature suffers 3d6 {Po} and becomes **paralyzed** for 2d4 turns at the end of the attercop’s initiative. The paralysis can be cured by *neutralize poison* but not *cure light injury.* When the paralysis wears off, the poisoned creature is **fatigued**. The fatigue ends if the poison is neutralized or after the creature enjoys 8 hours of restful sleep.

To aid in ambush, hideous attercops spin webs in strategic locations around their lairs. They use these webs to entangle victims in their webs in order to capture them and keep them fresh for later consumption. They can also spin a web around a target as a melee attack. If a creature moves into an attercop’s web, or if an attercop succeeds on a webspinning attack throw against a creature, that creature becomes **webbed.**

The attercop’s **webbed mechanoreception** enables them to “see” any creatures touching their webs.

### Attercop, Monstrous

Monstrous attercops are the first-generation offspring of a demonic attercop and a giant spider of the mortal sort. A monstrous attercop specimen has a length of around 8’ and a weight of around 500 lbs. Like their progenitors, these arachnid horrors dwell in the fetid swamps, dark forests, and high mountains of the wild.

Attercops are sapient and speak their own horrific language. Scholars who have studied Ancient Zaharan, Khepri, and Thrassian find certain similarities in the attercop tongue.

###### Combat

Monstrous attercops are ambush predators, and creatures encountering attercops suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls due to the spiders’ **natural stealth**.

Their bites carry a highly toxic **paralytic venom.** A creature damaged by a monstrous attercop’s bite must make a Death saving throw at -2. If the save succeeds, the creature is not affected by the venom. If the save fails, then creature suffers 4d6 {P} damage and becomes **paralyzed** for 2d4 turns at the end of the attercop’s initiative. The paralysis can be cured by *neutralize poison* but not *cure light injury.* When the paralysis wears off, the poisoned creature is **fatigued**. The fatigue ends if the poison is neutralized or after the creature enjoys 8 hours of restful sleep.

To aid in ambush, monstrous attercops spin webs in strategic locations around their lairs. They use these webs to entangle victims in their webs in order to capture them and keep them fresh for later consumption. They can also spin a web around a target as a melee attack. If a creature moves into an attercop’s web, or if an attercop succeeds on a webspinning attack throw against a creature, that creature becomes **webbed.**

The attercop’s **webbed mechanoreception** enables them to “see” any creatures touching their webs.

###### Ecology

Monstrous attercops can reproduce with any other attercops; the mother determines the resultant offspring. When encountered in a den, there is a 10% chance per monstrous attercop that it will be guarding a clutch of 2d4 eggs. Monstrous attercop eggs have 1 hp and weigh 1 2/6 st.

###### Spoils

A slain monstrous attercop can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the following components useful in magic research:

* mandibles (4/6 st, 45gp, *poison*)
* leg tarsus (4/6 st, 45gp, *spider climb*)
* spinneret (1 4/6 st, 100gp, *chameleon, webbing*)

If not used for magic research, a monstrous attercop’s mandibles fetch 12gp and weigh 1/6 st.

### Baboon, Rock

These black-haired black-eyed baboons are found throughout Ulruk and as far north as the Dark Wall in Southern Argollë. They stand 4’6” tall and weigh 230lbs, though the largest strongest males can reach 6’ in height.

Rock baboons are highly intelligent animals capable of forming plans and using tools. While they do not have a true language, rock baboons can plead, threaten, and warn other creatures with cries, screams, and gestures. They are omnivores that often hunt for meat.

###### Combat

Unlike most apes, rock baboons are highly aggressive, and are easily stimulated to fight (-1 penalty to reaction rolls). In combat, they both bite and use sticks as clubs.

Baboons are very agile and strong, capable of easily scaling trees or rocks and leaping across ledges or branches. They can climb as if they were 5th level thieves and jump as if they had 18 DEX.

###### Ecology

When rock baboons are encountered in their den, the adults will be raising 3d6-3 juvenile baboons and 2d6-2 baby baboons. Juvenile rock baboons have Speed 90’, AC 1, 1 HD, and attack with a bite (1 piercing damage). Infant baboons have Spd 90’, AC 0, 1 hp, ML -4, and do not fight.

###### Spoils

A slain rock baboon with exceptional attributes can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following components useful in magic research:

* skull (2/6 st, 20gp, *frighten beast, speak with beasts*)

A rock baboon's pelt fetches 25gp and weighs 4/6 st.

###### Encounter

High atop the trees of a rugged, broken landscape, **15 rock baboons** keep watch day and night for any intruders to their den. They patrol between the treetops and the large cliffs, calling out to one another with high-pitched howls and screeches. If anyone encroaches, the seven largest baboons will attack, leaping down on them from the upper branches of the trees. The remaining baboons will hang back to protect the young, consisting of **5 juveniles** and **7 babies**. The baboons have no treasure, but tall, colorful spikes of finger-like flowers grow thickly along the rocky slopes where they live. A Naturalism proficiency throw recognizes this as foxglove, a poisonous plant. There are enough plants to extract six doses of toxin (see *ACKS*,p.250).

Rock baboons (15): Spd 120’, AC 3, HD 2, hp 9 each, #AT 2 (bite/club 9+), Dmg 1d3 {P} /1d6 {B}, Save F2, ML 0, AL N, XP 20

### Báleygr

Báleygr (Old Jutlandic for “flaming-eyed”) are dreadful demons of smoke and flame, resembling 12’ tall iron-skinned minotaurs with fiery eyes and stunted black wings. Báleygr rejoice in war and bloodshed, and typically carry giant-sized weapons of black metal in each hand, favoring a sword, axe, or mace in one hand and a whip in the other.

Some sages believe that the báleygr were once guardians of the Elemental Sphere of Fire, and that they were turned to darkness by Bel, called the Slaughterprince, the Chthonic god of battle. Others claim they are born of the hates and fears of men, and grow stronger as the world descends into chaos. Whatever their origins, báleygr are fearsome foes who bring ruin to any that stand against them.

Báleygr are as intelligent as they are evil. All báleygr can speak Common and two other languages, often Ancient Zaharan and the local beastman dialect.

###### Combat

At will, a báleygr can surround itself with an **aura of elemental fire** and/or **shrouding smoke**. When the báleygr’s aura of elemental fire is active, creatures within 15’ of the báleygr take 1d8 {F!} damage if they begin their initiative in its aura, or move into it on their initiative. When its aura of shrouding smoke is active, the báleygr is hidden by the smoke and any creatures (other than the báleygr) within 25’ of it are **blinded** unless able to discern invisible. The báleygr can have both auras active, if desired.

A báleygr is **dreadful** to confront.A creature which starts its initiative, or moves within, 60’ of a báleygr must make a Paralysis saving throw. If the save succeeds, the creature gains immunity to the effects of every báleygr’s dreadfulness for 1 turn. If the save fails, the creature starts **faltering.** If the creature was already faltering, it becomes **frightened** instead. The faltering or frightened condition ends if removed magically or if the báleygr is destroyed or no longer within 60’. As a báleygr’s dreadful presence is preternatural, it functions even through the obscurement of its aura of shrouding smoke.

In melee, a báleygr will strike with one of its giant-sized weapons. Targets within 10’ can be attacked with its sword, axe, or mace for 4d6 {W!} damage. More distant targets, up to 30’, can be attacked with its whip for 2d6 {S!} damage. Targets struck by the báleygr’s whip must make successful size-adjusted Paralysis throws or be dragged adjacent to the báleygr.

Occasionally báleygr arm themselves with huge bows, with which they shoot flaming arrows. Báleygr’s bows have twice the range of longbows and deal 4d6 {P!} {F!} damage on a successful attack. A báleygr can cleave with its bow without restriction from the weapon. All of a báleygr’s weapons melt into slag if the creature is slain.

A báleygr has the spellcasting abilities of a 9th level mage with the following spells in its repertoire: 1st - *blinding flash, counterspell, kindle flame, weave smoke, tenebrosity*; 2nd – *battering ram, burning sparks, circling winds, discern invisible, shrouding fog*; 3rd – *boil blood, fireball, thunderbolt, weave fire*; 4th – *inferno, scouring zephyr, wall of flame*; 5th – *carnage, fire storm*.

A báleygr is **immune** to death effects and to fire, necrotic, and poisonous damage. It is **resistant** to acidic, bludgeoning, cold, electricity, piercing, seismic, and slashing damage. It possesses **lightless vision** (90’) and **telepathy**, which allows it to communicate with any creatures it encounters. It can be held at bay by *holy circle*and rebuked by a divine caster as an infernal creature. If rebuked, however, it can make a Spells saving throw; if the save succeeds, the báleygr can ignore the effect and cannot be rebuked by that divine caster again.

Báleygr are unholy beings that can be detected with *discern evil*, held at bay by *holy circle* and destroyed with *dispel evil.* If summoned, they can be returned to their home spheres by *counterspell* or *dispel magic*.

###### Ecology

Báleygr dwell in the bowels of the earth, in furnaces of elemental fire or sinkholes of evil. From time to time, dwarven engineers who delve too deep come upon these terrible creatures of smoke and flame.

If encountered in a wilderness lair, a legion of báleygr will be led by a **báleygr lord**. The lord has a 25% chance to be mounted on a winged drake-form red dragon of mature adult age.

###### Spoils

A destroyed báleygr can be harvested with Alchemy 2 for the following components useful in magic research:

* black ashy remains (95 st, 5700gp, *cone of fear, inspire horror, panic, shrouding fog,* all fire elemental effects)

The black ashy remains of báleygr lords are even more valuable (141 4/6 st, 8500gp).

###### Lore

*When the war-drum was struck the twelfth time, the báleygr came forth. Smoke shrouded it, hot as forge-fire. Dreadful was its presence, and many men, once accounted among brave, faltered and fled at its approach.*

*But Valerian Bellësareus was not afraid. The Lord of the Empyrean Host stepped into the smoky furnace, calling out to his warriors. “Be not afraid of the terror of darkness, for Ammonar shall illumine the way!” And his sword of fire held aloft was like a beacon-fire that guides ships to port in dark fog.*

* Azendor, *Seven Radiant Scrolls,* Fourth Book of the Empyrean War

### Barghest, Greater

Iskara, mother of monsters, bred the first barghests by infusing cacodemon ichor into the bodies of great wolves. The greater barghests were created as lords and chieftains of their kind, bred by Iskara with the ichor of her most powerful cacodemons. Every greater barghest is enormous, measuring around 13’6” long and 8’ tall at the shoulder and weighing 2,900 lbs. Barghests are as intelligent as mortal men. They can speak Ancient Zaharan, Classical Auran, Common, Elvish, and the dialect of any local beastmen.

###### Combat

Greater barghests have **acute hearing** and **acute olfaction.** They gain a +2 bonus to avoid surprise in their natural habitat. They can track the scent of creatures for up to 6 miles with the equivalent of three ranks of Tracking.

A greater barghest is **dreadful** to confront.A creature which starts its initiative, or moves within, 60’ of a greater barghest must make a Paralysis saving throw. If the save succeeds, the creature gains immunity to the effects of every barghest’s dreadfulness for 1 turn. If the save fails, the creature starts **faltering.** If the creature was already faltering, it becomes **frightened** instead. The faltering or frightened condition ends if removed magically or if the greater barghest is destroyed or no longer within 60’.

The bite of a greater barghest is both **venomous** and **maiming**. Any creature damaged by the bite must make a successful Death saving throw or die in one turn. A creature bitten with an attack throw of unmodified 20 must make an additional Death saving throw. If the save succeeds, the bite inflicts double damage dice (8d6). If the save fails, the bite inflicts triple damage dice (12d6) and the creature loses a limb. Roll 1d6 to determine which limb is lost: 1-2, weapon hand; 3, weapon arm; 4-5, near leg; 6, far leg. A character who loses a limb is **incapacitated** until he gets 2 weeks of bed rest.

###### Ecology

Greater barghest studs mate rather indiscriminately, coupling with lesser barghests, wargs, dire wolves, and wolves in order to produce various lupin sub-species. Greater barghest bitches reproduce rarely and only with their own kind.

When a greater barghest is encountered in its den, there is a 50% chance it will be a bitch rearing puppies. Roll 1d6 for age and number; 1-4, it’s 1d2 juveniles; 5-6 it’s 1d2+2 babies. Juveniles have AC 4, Spd 150’, HD 5, and attack with 1 bite (2d6 {P}). Babies have AC 3, Spd 150’, HD 3+3, and 1 bite (1d6 {P}). The bites of the puppies are not maiming.

###### Spoils

A slain greater barghest can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the following components useful in magic research:

* fangs (22 1/6 st, 1450gp, *carnage, dismember, giant strength, slicing blow*)
* heart (21 2/6 st, 1400gp, *call of the wolf pack, cone of fear, dominate beast, frighten beast, inspire horror, panic*)

If not used for magic research, a greater barghest’s fangs fetch 24gp and weigh 2/6 st. Its venom (onset time 1 round, -1 saving modifier, 10d6 {Po} damage on failed Death saving throw) fetches 800gp and weighs 1/6 st. Its pelt fetches 390gp and weighs 7 4/6 st.

### Barghest, Lesser

Iskara, mother of monsters, bred the first barghests by infusing cacodemon ichor into the bodies of great wolves. The lesser barghests were bred with hellions (8 HD cacodemons). Though called “lesser”, these barghests are larger and stronger than even wargs, with a length of 12’, a height of 7’3” at the shoulder, and a weight of 2,100 lbs. Barghests are as intelligent as mortal men. They can speak Ancient Zaharan, Classical Auran, Common, Elvish, and the dialect of any local beastmen.

###### Combat

Lesser barghests have **acute hearing** and **acute olfaction.** They gain a +2 bonus to avoid surprise in their natural habitat. They can track the scent of creatures for up to 6 miles with the equivalent of three ranks of Tracking proficiency.

Due to their powerful jaws, lesser barghests have **bone-breaking bites**. If the barghest succeeds on an attack throw with an unmodified 20, the creature bitten must make a Death saving throw. If the save succeeds, the creature suffers double the ordinary damage dice (6d6). If the save fails, the creature suffers triple the ordinary damage (9d6) and has a limb broken. Roll 1d6 to determine which limb is broken: 1-2 weapon hand, 3 weapon arm, 4-5 near leg, 6 far leg.

A broken limb has the same game effect as a missing limb (***ACKS II RR***Permanent Wounds tables, p. XX – XX) until it heals. A broken wound heals after 180 days, or 90 days under treatment of a healer.

###### Ecology

Lesser barghest studs mate rather indiscriminately, freely coupling with lesser barghests, wargs, dire wolves, and wolves in order to produce various lupin sub-species. Lesser barghest bitches reproduce only with greater or lesser barghests.

When lesser barghests are encountered in their den, the adults will be rearing puppies. Roll 1d6 for age and number: 1-4, it’s 1d2 juveniles, 5-6 it’s 1d2+2 babies. Juveniles have AC 3, Spd 150’, HD 4+1, and attack with 1 bite (1d10). Babies have AC 2, Spd 150’, HD 2+3, and 1 bite (1d4). The bites of the puppies are not venomous or maiming.

There is a 10% chance the den will be ruled by a **greater barghest**. If so, then any offspring will be greater barghest juveniles and babies.

###### Spoils

A slain barghest can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the following components useful in magic research:

* fangs (9 2/6 st, 550gp, *carnage, dismember, ogre strength, slicing blow*)
* heart (9 2/6 st, 550gp, *call of the wolf pack, dominate beast, frighten beast*)

### Basilisk, Noxious

The noxious basilisk, sometimes called the primordial basilisk, was created from spite and venom by Iskara, Mother of Monsters, during her terrible war with the gods. It resembles a reptilian monster with a dun-colored body and mustard-hued underbelly and a short, curved horn atop the nose. An adult basilisk’s body grows to about 10’ long and weighs 300 lbs.

###### Combat

Noxious basilisks have tough hides that are **resistant** to mundane bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.

The bite of a noxious basilisk carries a **paralytic venom**. Any creature damaged by a primordial basilisk’s bite must make a Death saving throw. If the save succeeds, the creature is not affected by the venom. If the save fails, then creature suffers 6d6 {Po!} damage and becomes **paralyzed** for 2d4 turns at the end of the basilisk’s initiative. The paralysis can be cured by *neutralize poison* but not *cure light injury.* When the paralysis wears off, the poisoned creature is **fatigued**. The fatigue ends if the poison is neutralized or after the creature enjoys 8 hours of restful sleep.

In lieu of biting, a noxious basilisk can breathe a noxious cloud 20’ in diameter. Any creature within the cloud’s area of effect must make a Death saving throw. The effects of the noxious cloud are identical to the paralytic bite. A noxious basilisk’s breath weapon can be used once every 1d3 rounds.

###### Ecology

Noxious basilisks often live in dense woods or dungeons. When noxious basilisks are encountered in a wilderness nest, there is a 10% chance per basilisk that it will be incubating 1d3 eggs. Basilisk eggs have 1 hp and weigh 2/6 st. Basilisk hatchlings are rarely found in nests, because the hatchlings immediately disperse into the wild after they emerge from their eggs.

###### Spoils

A slain noxious basilisk can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the following components useful in magic research:

* eyes (8 2/6 st., 500gp, *cloud of poison, cone of paralysis, halt monster, hypnotic sigil*)
* gizzard (8 2/6 st., 500gp, *cure injury, neutralize poison*)

A noxious basilisk’s horn fetches 2d10gp and weighs 1 stone for every 80gp.

Basilisks are difficult to train, but their powerful abilities allow them to command a premium.

###### Lore

*Horned basilisks appear as antagonists to the gods and heroes in the earliest recorded myths of the Argollëans, dating back to 3,500 BE. Smoothskull basilisks, however, are not attested in mythology until 2000 BE. From this, the sages of the Tower of Knowledge have surmised that the horned basilisk is the older of the two species, and probably was created before the Day Without Night.*

### Basilisk, Petrifying

The petrifying basilisk was created by crossbreeding a primordial basilisk with a gorgon. Like its progenitor, it resembles a reptilian monster with a dun-colored body and mustard-hued underbelly with a length of 10’ and weight of 300 lbs. However, petrifying basilisks lack the horn characteristic of their primordial kin.

###### Combat

Petrifying basilisks have tough hides that are **resistant** to mundane bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.

The bite of a petrifying basilisk can turn a creature to stone. Any creature that is bitten must make a Paralysis saving throw. If the save succeeds, the creature is unaffected. If the save fails, the creature is instantaneously **petrified**.

In lieu of biting, a petrifying basilisk can direct its **petrifying gaze** in in a cone 60' long and 30' wide in front of itself. Each creature within the cone that is beholding the basilisk must make a Paralysis saving throw. If the save succeeds, the creature is not affected. If the save fails, the creature is instantly **petrified**.

###### Ecology

Petrifying basilisks often live in dense woods or dungeons. When petrifying basilisks are encountered in their nest there is a 10% chance per basilisk that it will be incubating 1d3 eggs. Basilisk eggs have 1 hp and weigh 2/6 st. Basilisk hatchlings are rarely found in nests, because the hatchlings immediately disperse into the wild after they emerge from their eggs.

###### Spoils

Any treasure in a petrifying basilisk’s nest will be on petrified victims, and will only be accessible if the victims are restored to flesh.

A slain petrifying basilisk can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the following components useful in magic research:

* eyes (8 2/6 st., 500gp, *blinding flash, cone of paralysis, hypnotic sigil, petrification*)
* gizzard (8 2/6 st., 500gp, *depetrification, earth’s mire*)
* Basilisks are difficult to train, but their powerful abilities allow them to command a premium.

###### Lore

*There are two species of basilisk in Aurëpos: the horned basilisk and the smoothskull basilisk. Of the dangers of the horned basilisk, whose noxious miasma slays any who inhale it, I have already written. But the dangers posed by the smoothskull basilisk are actually far greater, for the very sight of the creature can turn a man to stone. An encounter with such a basilisk cost us seven members of our expedition, among them my beloved Optëlitas. Had I but looked at the basilisk’s skull, I could have warned them, and she would still be flesh… but then I would have been stone.*

### Bat, Common

Common bats are small nocturnal flying mammals with leathery wings. By day bats nestle in dark forests, lightless caverns, and abandoned towers and attics. By night, they emerge from their roosts in great swarms, patrolling the skies for prey using their echolocation.

###### Combat

Since eyesight is of little use in the dark, bats navigate and hunt with **echolocation** (360’ range). No spells or effects that would ordinarily blind a creature will affect a bat, but *inaudible* creatures are hidden from them, and *noiselessness* blinds them.

Common bats are small insectivores who do not attack for significant damage individually. They are **not disposed to fight**, and as such they must make a morale roll at the end of every round. (The morale roll does not apply to bats that are under another’s control or are familiars.)

###### Ecology

Although individual bats can be encountered flapping around dungeons, normally they will be encountered in such great number as to constitute a swarm. See the Swarm monster entry (p. XX) for further information on bat swarms.

###### Spoils

A slain common bat cannot be harvested for special components.

###### Lore

*The bat is a creature upon which countless civilizations have projected their myths and legends.*

*In the Auran Empire, the bat is believed ill-omened, cursed by Ammonar to shun his glorious light to dwell forever in the tenebrous night.*

*In dusky Kemesh, the bat is held sacred, especially by the priestesses of Nasga. Great swarms of blood-drinking bats are said to be bred in the high lofts of the ziggurats and sent forth by night to shed blood for their dark mistresses…*

*In truth, the bat deserves neither the condemnation nor the acclaim. It is merely an animal, perhaps related to the fox or the rat, and certainly not an incarnation of chaos. Even its penchant for drinking blood is much exaggerated; indeed, the bats I have come upon in the caves and forests of Aurëpos have preferred to nibble on fruit.*

*That there exist dangerous species of bats cannot be denied; but that the common bat itself is a harbinger of vampiric undeath must be dismissed as mere folklore.*

* Toraster the Elder, *Bestiary of Aurëpos*

### Bat, Giant

Giant bats were bred from vampiric stock to be large fierce flying carnivores. A full-grown adult has a 17’ wingspan and weighs around 75 lbs.

Giant bats prefer to nest in the same environments as their ordinary cousins, such as dark forests, lightless caverns, and abandoned towers and attics. Because of their much greater size, they do not form swarms, although they occasionally can gather in groups as large as 30.

###### Combat

Like ordinary bats, giant bats navigate and hunt with **echolocation** (540’ range). No spells or effects that would ordinarily blind a creature will affect a bat, but *inaudible* creatures are hidden from them, and *noiselessness* blinds them.

###### Ecology

Whenever giant bats are encountered, each giant bat has a 15% chance of carrying a bat pup. Roll 1d4 for age: 1 it’s a baby bats, 2-4 it’s a juvenile bat. Juvenile giant bats have AC 1, Spd 30’, HD 1, and 1 bite (1d4). Baby giant bats have AC 0, Spd 15’, HD 1/2, ML -4, and do not fight.

###### Spoils

A slain giant bat can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following component:

* ears (3/6 st, 29gp*, inaudibility, noiselessness*)

###### Encounter

Ancient stone steps lead down into a small depression in the earth here, some 240’ diameter. At the foot of the steps, a granite stone slab covers an entrance that leads into the side of the depression. The stone slab is heavily weathered and very old, and sits partly open. (Fully opening or closing the heavy stone door requires a proficiency throw to open doors at -4.) Beyond the stone slab door is a catacomb gallery, 7’ high, 8’ wide, and 30’ long, with thirty wall graves piercing the walls.

The graves were long ago robbed and hold only worthless trinkets, while the skeletons crumble to dust if touched. Now the catacomb is the lair of **eight giant bats**. The bats leave at dusk each night to hunt, returning at dawn, so adventurers who reach the lair during evening hours may think it is unoccupied. The bats have no treasure. Once the bats are dealt with, the catacombs can be used as a safe base to explore the surrounding area.

Giant bats (8): Spd 30’/180’ fly, AC 3, HD 2\*, hp 14, 11, 10, 10, 9, 9, 8, 7, #AT 1 (bite 9+), Dmg 1d4 {P}, Save F1, ML 0, AL N, XP 20; Special: echolocation

### Bat, Giant Vampire

Giant vampire bats are huge demon-blooded bats descended from dakhanavar. They have 25’ wingspans and weigh 200 lbs. Giant vampire bats lurk in the same dark and high places that other bats favor.

Giant vampire bats are as intelligent as they are evil. They can speak their own language (which combines rhythmic chirps and trills with ultrasonic tones) as well as the dialect of any local beastmen.

###### Combat

If a vampire bat damages a creature with its bite, the vampire bat latches onto the creature and begins **draining blood**.Once latched on, the giant vampire bat can use its combat action to automatically deal another 2d4 {N}damage to the creature each round.

Creatures that are having their blood drained by a giant vampire bat can still move, but count as carrying 20 extra stone of encumbrance. The bat moves with the creature from which it is drinking blood.

Like other bats, giant vampire bats navigate and hunt with **echolocation** (540’ range). No spells or effects that would ordinarily blind a creature will affect a bat, but *inaudible* creatures are hidden from their echolocation, while *noiselessness* blinds it. Unlike other bats, however, giant vampire bats have **lightless vision** (60’) they can use when echolocation fails.

###### Ecology

Whenever giant vampire bats are encountered, each giant vampire bat has a 15% chance of carrying a bat pup. Roll 1d4 for age; 1-2 it’s a baby bat, 3-4 it’s a juvenile bat. Juvenile giant vampiric bats have AC 1, Spd 30’, HD 2, and 1 bite (1d3). Baby giant vampire bats have AC 0, HD 1+1, and 1 bite (1 piercing damage). Neither can drain blood.

###### Spoils

A slain giant vampire bat can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the following components useful in magic research:

* ears (1 st, 60gp, *inaudibility, noiselessness*)
* fangs (1 1/6 st, 75gp, *bloody flux*)

### Bear, Black

Black bears are omnivorous apex predators that live in many different climates throughout Cybele. They average 6' tall and weigh about 550 lbs. They dine on a variety of fruits and other foliage more frequently than meat. Black bears do not usually engage in combat unless they are forced to do so in defense of their cubs. However, black bears defending their cubs gain a +4 bonus to morale rolls.

###### Combat

Black bears have **acute olfaction** and gain a +1 bonus to avoid surprise in their natural habitat. They can track the scent of creatures for up to 6 miles with the equivalent of three ranks of Tracking proficiency. They are **skilled climbers** (the best of any of the bears), able to ascend sheer surfaces as if they were thieves (4+).

If a black bear successfully attacks the same target with both claws in the same attack routine, it immediately **hugs** the target for an additional 2d8 {B} damage. If the hug kills the target, the bear can cleave with its claw.

###### Ecology

When black bears are encountered in a wilderness den, there isa 66% chance the adults will be rearing bear cubs. Roll 1d4 for their age and number: 1 it’s 1d2+1 babies, 2-4 it’s 1d3-1 juveniles. Juvenile black bears have AC 1, Spd 90’, HD 2, and attack with two claws (1 {S}) and bite (1d2 {P}). Baby black bears have AC 0, Spd 90’, HD 1+1, and attack with one nibble (1 {P}).

###### Spoils

A slain black bear with exceptional attributes can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following components useful in magic research:

* claws (3/6 st, 30gp, *iron maiden, swift sword*)
* stomach (5/6 st, 50gp, *call of the wild bear, slumber*)

A black bears's pelt fetches 45gp and weighs 1 3/6 st.

While not domesticated, black bears can be trained and tamed relatively easily if captured while young.

###### Encounter

From the rich soil here sprouts a centuries-old oak tree, its great trunk over 10’ in diameter. A hollow has formed in the tree’s base, which serves as the den of a **mated pair of black bears** and their **two cubs**. The black bears will not engage in combat unless they have to, but will give their lives to defend their cubs.

### Bear, Brown

Brown bears are omnivorous apex predators that dwell in the forests of Aurëpos and Danea. They average 9’ tall and weigh about 800 lbs. They have brown or red fur, which in older individuals might be silver-tipped. Brown bears are much more aggressive and carnivorous than black bears.

They are revered through the north as spirit animals of great significance, especially by the berserkers of Jutland. In the Auran Empire itself, they are often used as fighting animals in the great arenas.

###### Combat

Brown bears have **acute olfaction** and gain a +1 bonus to avoid surprise in their natural habitat. They can track the scent of creatures for up to 6 miles with the equivalent of three ranks of Tracking proficiency. They are also **skilled climbers**, able to ascend sheer surfaces as if they were thieves (6+).

If a brown bear successfully attacks the same target with both claws in the same attack routine, it immediately **hugs** the target for an additional 2d8 {B}damage. If the hug kills the target, the bear can cleave with its claw.

###### Ecology

When brown bears are encountered in a wilderness den, there is a 66% chance the adults will be rearing bear cubs. Roll 1d4 for their age: 1-2 it’s 1d2+1 babies, 3-4 it’s 1d3-1 juveniles. Juveniles have AC 1, Spd 90’, HD 2+2, and attack with two claws (1d2 {S}) and bite (1d3 {P}). Baby brown bears have AC 0, Spd 90’, HD 1+2, and attack with two scritches (1 {S}) and one nibble (1 {P}).

###### Spoils

A slain brown bear with exceptional attributes can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following components useful in magic research:

* claws (1 4/6 st, 100gp, *iron maiden, swift sword*)
* stomach (1 4/6 st, 100gp, *call of the wild bear, slumber*)

A brown bear's pelt fetches 75gp and weighs 2 1/6 st.

Dwarven animal trainers delight in training brown bears, which they raise from infancy to be mighty war mounts.

###### Encounter

A small knoll, about 15’ high, is lushly overgrown with wild shrubs and grasses. Its nearest face is pierced by a 4’ diameter tunnel that burrows into the knoll. This is the lair of a **brown bear** of formidable strength and size. The beast has been a man-eater for years, and will charge any adventurers who turn their backs on its den. Because of the grizzly bear’s extraordinary size, its pelt is especially valuable (225gp, 2 1/6 st), and its claws and stomach are useful as special components (100gp, 1 4/6 st each).

Brown bear: Str 16, Con 16; Spd 120’, AC 3, HD 5+10, hp 32, #AT 3 (2 claws/bite 4+), Dmg 1d4+2 {S} /1d4+2 {S} /1d8+2 {P}, Save F2, ML 0, AL N, XP 200; Special: hug (2d8+4 {B} if both claws strike in one round)

### Bear, Cave

These immense bears stand up to 10' tall and weigh 1,100 lbs or more. They live in caves and caverns throughout the slopes of the Jutting and Meniri Mountains.

###### Combat

Cave bears particularly savor the taste of human and demi-human flesh. Humans and demi-humans suffer a -2 reaction roll penalty when encountering them.

The fierce beasts have **acute olfaction** and gain a +1 bonus to avoid surprise in their natural habitat. They can track the scent of creatures for up to 6 miles with the equivalent of three ranks of Tracking proficiency. As **cave dwellers**, they rarely get lost navigate lightless caverns (Caving proficiency). Like other bears, they are **skilled climbers**, able to ascend sheer surfaces as if they were thieves (6+).

If a cave bear successfully attacks the same target with both claws in the same attack routine, it immediately **hugs** the target for an additional 2d8 {B}damage. If the hug kills the target, the bear can cleave with its claw.

###### Ecology

When cave bears are encountered in a wilderness den, there is a 66% chance the adults will be rearing bear cubs. Roll 1d4 for their age; 1-2, it’s 1d2+1 babies, 3-4 it’s 1d3-1 juveniles. Juvenile cave bears have AC 1, Spd 90’, HD 3, and attack with two claws (1d2 {S}) and bite (1d4 {P}). Baby cave bears have AC 0, Spd 90’, HD 2, and attack with two scritches (1 {S}) and one nibble (1d2 {P}).

###### Spoils

A slain cave bear with exceptional attributes can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following components useful in magic research:

* claws (2 4/6 st, 160gp, *iron maiden, swift sword*)
* stomach (2 4/6 st, 160gp, *call of the wild bear, locate animal or plant, slumber*)

A cave bears's pelt fetches 160gp and weighs 3 st.

Cave bears are rather more difficult to train than their smaller cousins.

###### Encounter

A talus cave, some 8’ high and 9’ wide and deep, has formed between boulders piled up on the slope of a rocky, 60’ high, 900’ wide knoll. The cave is the home of a mated **pair of cave bears**, along with their **three baby cubs**. These beasts are perpetually hungry for meat. They will attack any intruders who approach the cave, and follow the scent of blood of wounded party members.

### Bear, Polar

These bears live in the freezing climates of Danae north of the Jutting Mountains. During very cold winters, polar bears have been known to cross the snowy passes and range across Jutland and Rorn. Polar bears average about 11' tall and can weigh as much as 1,400 lbs.

###### Combat

Polar bears are almost purely carnivorous and highly aggressive. All creatures suffer a -4 reaction roll penalty when encountering them.

Like other bears, they have **acute olfaction** and gain a +1 bonus to avoid surprise in their natural habitat. They can track the scent of creatures for up to 6 miles with the equivalent of three ranks of Tracking proficiency. They are **adept at swimming** (as Swimming proficiency) and **surefooted on snow**, allowing them to ignore the movement penalties from Snowy conditions.

If a polar bear successfully attacks the same target with both claws in the same attack routine, it immediately **hugs** the target for an additional 2d8 {B} damage. If the hug kills the target, the bear can cleave with its claw.

###### Ecology

When polar bears are encountered in a wilderness den, there is a 66% chance the adults will be rearing bear cubs. Roll 1d4 for their age; 1-2, it’s 1d2+1 babies, 3-4 it’s 1d3-1 juveniles. Juvenile polar bears have AC 2, Spd 90’, HD 3+2, and attack with two claws (1d3 {S}) and bite (1d6 {S}). Baby cave bears have AC 1, Spd 90’, HD 2+1, and attack with two scritches (1 {S}) and one nibble (1d2 {P}).

###### Spoils

A slain polar bear with exceptional attributes can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) for the following components useful in magic research:

* claws (4 stone, 240gp, *ice floe, ice sheet, iron maiden, swift sword*)
* stomach (3 2/6 st, 200gp, *call of the wild bear, protection from temperature, slumber*)

A polar bear's pelt fetches 200gp and weighs 3 4/6 st.

Polar bears are rather more difficult to train than their smaller cousins.

###### Encounter

The snow-blanketed landscape is pierced by a burrowed hole, about 4’ in diameter. Close inspection of the hole reveals icicles of blood and white hairs frozen along its edge. Lingering too long, or entering the hole itself, earns the ire of the **polar bear** within, which will aggressively charge the adventurers. Characters clambering into the hole will discover a 10’ long tunnel that terminates in a large burrow filled with bones.

Polar bear: Spd 120’, AC 4, HD 7, hp 37, #AT 3 (2 claws/bite 4+), Dmg 1d8 {S} /1d8 {S} /2d6 {S} , Save F3, ML +1, AL N, XP 440; Special: hug (2d8 {B} if both claws strike in one round)

### Beastman

Beastmen are the crossbred creations of ancient Zahar, created by ancient magic and enslaved in service to their dark masters. The Zaharans created many breeds of beastmen, sometimes crossing different strains repeatedly in their quest for the perfect living weapon. Six major breeds of beastmen have been identified by the sages of Aura: kobolds, goblins, orcs, hobgoblins, gnolls, and bugbears. The Zaharans also bred ogres and trolls, though the sages of Aura consider them separate species (q.v.).

Apart from kobolds, who were bred as pets, the other breeds of beastmen were created to be soldiers for the Zaharan army – ruthless and blood-thirsty, but susceptible to control by a powerful leader. In the absence of an external authority (such as a Zaharan sorcerer-king), beastmen organize themselves into bands of loosely-related gangs ruled by a chieftain. Endemic warfare between nearby bands is constant, until eventually one of the chieftains succeeds in unifying the bands into a clan under his rule. Born of evil magic, there is nothing redeemable about beastmen, and every Auran missionary who has ever attempted to find good in them has ended up dying painfully and being eaten.

Isolated bands usually have no permanent home, living a nomadic existence that follows seasonably available wild plants and game. Nomadic beastmen dwell in tents made from animal hides sewn together or woven hair wrapped around wooden poles. These tents are usually small, but can be as large as thirty feet in diameter. Less fortunate nomads may just take shelter where they can find it. Nomadic beastmen survive by hunting wildlife, gathering wild forage, and raiding civilized settlements. Roving bands are often composed of only males, their females having been lost to stronger rivals.

Established beastman clans tend to permanently or semi-permanently dwell in ruins, caves, captured strongholds, or villages. Beastmen in villages generally live in roundhouses constructed of whatever materials are at hand. In wet, wooded climates, roundhouses with timber or wattle-and-daub walls and thatched roofs will dominate. In other terrain, the walls are constructed of mudbrick or stone, mortared with sand, soil, and dung, while the roof covering is of woven hair or animal-hide, sewn to short spars. Stone-lined pits are dug for iron forges, kilns, food storage, and waste.

Sometimes the buildings are gathered to form a ring fort or hill-fort, surrounded by ditches, moats, earthen ramparts or piled stone walls. The skulls of dead foes frequently adorn these defenses.

When settled, beastmen clans practice horticulture, cultivating small plots of mixed crops using hand tools. Beastmen care nothing for crop rotation or soil sustainability, and will simply burn or cut away a clearing, then farm it until the soil is exhausted. It is not uncommon to find large tracts of exhausted scrub around beastmen settlements. In arid terrain, they may herd goats, sheep, cows, pigs, and other livestock that can graze on the scant vegetation. Beastmen tribes that have captured many prisoners in raids may have slave laborers working farms, but these are usually short-lived; beastmen do not breed or care for their slaves, and simply eat those that die.

Family relations are brutal; beastmen males are considerably larger than the females, whom they dominate. Both sexes lack any capacity whatsoever for compassion, empathy, kindness, or love. High-status males maintain large harems, within which the females compete for provision and protection. Low-status males have no chance to mate at all, except by gaining status through violence or subterfuge. As a result, beastmen males typically spend much of their time fighting, hunting, and raiding. More than half die from wounds sustained in such activities before middle age.

Beastmen care little for their prepubescent children, feeding them scraps and often exiling them to the edges of the camp fires. Many whelps die of exposure or under-nourishment, leaving just the toughest and most cunning to survive to adulthood, usually by murdering their siblings.

Beastmen who lack the size and temperament to serve as warriors are known as drudges, and are forced to handle all of the chores the warriors refuse to do, such as farming, foraging, cooking, and camping. Most of these drudges are females, but some are males who through disability, injury, or other reasons are unable to serve as warriors.

The drudges also craft blankets, clothing, furniture, tools, and shelter from the woven hair of sheep and goats, or the leather, bone, sinew, and hide of animals. Indeed, of the crafts, only metal-working is the province of warriors, and it is typically limited to working wrought iron in pit-furnaces. Knowledge of weapon- and armor-smithing is rare, with only a handful of smiths in a tribe. Knowledge is handed down orally within families, and blood feuds lasting generations can simmer between rival families.

Beastmen speak a number of distinct languages, each of which is a barely-recognizable dialect of Ancient Zaharan. A beastman warrior has a 10% chance of speaking Common. A beastman champion, chief, shaman, sub-chieftain, or witch doctor has a 10% chance per HD of speaking Common.

### Beastman, Bugbear

These large, hairy beastmen were magically bred from hobgoblins and bears by the ancient Zaharans to serve as guerilla warriors. Bugbears stand about 7’6” tall and weigh about 400 lbs.

###### Combat

Bugbears are **formidable warriors** and receive a +1 damage bonus. Despite their bulk, they are **naturally stealthy**, so characters encountering bugbears suffer a -1 penalty to surprise rolls. They rely on their **shaggy hides** for armor, which grant a +3 bonus to armor class.

Unless special troops are present (p. XX), 50% of gangs or warbands encountered will be archers (round up), 50% will be warriors (round down). Bugbear warriors are equipped with spear, battle axe, and shield. Some bugbear tribes field warriors equipped with hide armor and morning star. All bugbear archers are equipped with hide armor, short bow, 20 arrows, and battle axe.

###### Ecology

Each bugbear gang will be led by a champion with 5 AC, 4+1 HD, 25 hp, and a +3 damage bonus. Each bugbear warband will be led by a sub-chieftain with 6 AC, 5+1 HD, 29 hp, and a +3 damage bonus. A bugbear lair or village will be led by a chieftain with 7 AC, 7+2 HD, 37 hp, and a +4 damage bonus. As long as the chieftain is alive, the bugbears will gain a +2 bonus to morale rolls.

Bugbear lairs and villages will have drudges and whelps equal to 100% and 200% of the number of warriors each. Bugbear drudges fight as hobgoblins, while bugbear whelps fight as kobolds.

When bugbears are encountered in a village, certain additional creatures may be present. There is a 60% chance a bugbear village will be guarded by 2d6 trained cave bears. There is a 50% chance for 1d10 enslaved captives per warband. In addition, a bugbear village has a 75% chance of a shaman being present, and a 50% chance of a witch doctor. A shaman is equivalent to a sub-chieftain statistically, but has Shaman abilities at level 1d6. A witch doctor is equivalent to a champion statistically, but has Mage abilities at level 1d4.

### Beastman, Gnoll

Gnolls are chaotic beastmen allegedly bred by the ancient Zaharans during the Empyrean War to battle elven forces. Some sages believe gnolls descend from hybrids of men and hyenas, while others insist they were bred from gnomes and trolls. Whatever the case, an adult gnoll is a fearsome creature standing about 7’6” tall and 300 lbs with dirty yellow or reddish-brown fur. Gnolls prefer to be carnivorous, favoring intelligent creatures for food because they scream more, though gnolls themselves are not particularly intelligent.

###### Combat

Gnolls are **formidable warriors** and receive a +1 damage bonus. They benefit from **shaggy hides** which, though not as thick as bugbear hides, still grant a +1 bonus to armor class.

Unless special troops are present (p. XX), 50% of gangs or warbands encountered will be archers (round up), 50% will be warriors (round down). Most gnoll warriors are equipped with leather armor, spear, battle axe, and shield. Some gnoll tribes field warriors equipped with scale armor and morning star, pole arm, or two-handed sword. All gnoll archers are equipped with scale, long bow, 20 arrows, and battle axe.

###### Ecology

Each gnoll gang will be led by a champion with 5 AC, 3 HD, 16 hp, and a +2 damage bonus. Each gnoll warband will be led by a sub-chieftain with 6 AC, 4 HD, 20 hp, and a +2 damage bonus. A gnoll lair or village will be led by a chieftain with 7 AC, 6 HD, 28 hp, and a +3 damage bonus. As long as the chieftain is alive, the gnolls will gain a +2 bonus to morale rolls.

Gnoll lairs and villages will have drudges and whelps equal to 100% and 200% of the number of warriors, respectively. Gnoll drudges fight as orcs. Gnoll whelps have Spd 60’, AC 0, 1 hp, ML -4, and do not fight.

When gnolls are encountered in a village, certain additional creatures will be present. There is a 33% chance a gnoll village will be guarded by 1d3 trolls and another 66% chance for 4d4 trained hyenas. There is a 50% chance for 1d10 enslaved captives per warband. In addition, a village has a 60% chance of a shaman being present, and a 50% chance of a witch doctor. A shaman is equivalent to sub-chieftain statistically, but has Shaman abilities at level 1d4+1. A witch doctor is equivalent to a champion statistically, but has Mage abilities at level 1d4.

###### Spoils

### Beastman, Goblin

Goblins are repellent beastmen bred from dwarves and gnolls by the ancient Zaharans to fight in the narrow tunnels of the dwarven vaults. Goblins stand 3’ to 3 ½’ tall and weigh 45 lbs, with strong, wiry builds. Their eyes are usually dull and glazed, varying in color from red to yellow, and sometimes flicker red in the dark. Goblins’ skin color ranges from yellow through any shade of orange to a deep red; usually all members of a single tribe are about the same color. Goblins are archenemies of dwarves, who they hate above all other humanoids, followed closely by their distaste for gnomes. Goblins typically wear drab earth tones, the better to skulk and hide with.

###### Combat

Unless special troops are present (p. XX), 50% of gangs or warbands encountered will be archers (round up), 50% will be warriors (round down). Goblin warriors are equipped with leather armor, spear, short sword, and shield. Goblin archers are equipped with scale armor, short bows, 20 arrows, and short sword. Some goblin tribes might field slingers instead of archers, equipped with leather armor, sling, short sword, and shield.

###### Ecology

Each goblin gang will be led by a champion with 3 AC, 1 HD, and 7 hp. Each goblin warband will be led by a sub-chieftain with 4 AC, 1+1 HD, 9 hp, and a +1 damage bonus. A goblin lair or village will be led by a chieftain with 5 AC, 3 HD, 16 hp, and a +2 damage bonus. As long as the chieftain is alive, the goblins will gain a +2 bonus to morale rolls.

Goblin lairs and villages will have drudges and whelps equal to 100% and 100% of the number of warriors respectively. Goblin drudges and whelps have Spd 60’, AC 0, 1 hp, ML -4, and do not fight.

When goblins are encountered in a village, certain additional creatures may be present. There is a 60% chance a goblin village will be guarded by 5d6 dire wolves. There is a 50% chance for 1d10 enslaved captives per warband. In addition, a village has a 75% chance of a shaman being present, and a 50% chance of a witch doctor. A shaman is equivalent to a sub-chieftain statistically, but has Shaman abilities at level 2d4. A witch doctor is equivalent to a champion statistically, but has Mage abilities at level 1d6.

### Beastman, Hobgoblin

Hobgoblins were cross-bred from goblins and men by the ancient Zaharans as elite shock troops during the Empyrean War. Standing well over 6’ tall and weighing around 215 lbs, they are much larger, stronger, and smarter than their diminutive cousins. Hobgoblins have dark orange or red-orange skin, with hair ranging from dark reddish-brown to dark gray. Hobgoblins’ eyes are yellowish or dark brown, while their teeth are yellow. Their garments tend to be brightly colored, often blood red with black-dyed leather.

###### Combat

Hobgoblins are **formidable warriors** and receive a +1 damage bonus. They always keep their arms and armor in good repair and close at hand and are capable of fighting in well-ordered close formations such as maniples and phalanxes.

Unless special troops are present (p. XX), 50% of gangs or warbands encountered will be archers (round up), 50% will be warriors (round down). Hobgoblin warriors are equipped with leather armor, spear, sword, and shield. Some hobgoblin tribes field warriors equipped with scale armor and pole arm. Hobgoblin archers are equipped with scale armor, composite bow, 20 arrows, and sword.

###### Ecology

Each hobgoblin gang will be led by a champion with 5 AC, 2 HD, 9 hp, and a +1 damage bonus. Each hobgoblin warband will be led by a sub-chieftain with 6 AC, 3 HD, 13 hp, and a +2 damage bonus. A hobgoblin lair or village will be led by a chieftain with 7 AC, 5 HD, 21 hp, and a +3 damage bonus. As long as the chieftain is alive, the hobgoblins will gain a +2 bonus to morale rolls.

Hobgoblin lairs and villages will have drudges and whelps equal to 100% and 200% of the number of warriors, respectively. Hobgoblin drudges fight as goblins. Hobgoblin whelps have Spd 60’, AC 0, 1 hp, ML -4, and do not fight.

When hobgoblins are encountered in a village, certain additional creatures may be present. There is a 60% chance a hobgoblin village will be guarded by 2d6 trained cave gorillas. There is a 50% chance for 1d10 enslaved captives per warband. In addition, a hobgoblin village has a 90% chance to have a shaman present and a 75% chance of a witch doctor. A shaman is equivalent to a sub-chieftain statistically, but has Shaman abilities at level 1d8. A witch doctor is equivalent to a champion statistically, but has Mage abilities at level 1d6.

### Beastman, Kobold

Kobolds are short, cowardly, and sadistic beastmen bred as pets from lizardmen and dogs by the ancient Zaharans to mock their former masters, the Thrassians. Standing 2’ to 2 ½’ tall and weighing about 40 lbs, kobold have scaly lizard-like skin ranging from dark rusty brown to a rusty black color, but an overall conformation that is vaguely dog-like. All have glowing red eyes with reptilian pupils. They dwell exclusively underground. They wear little more than ragged hides and scraps of leather armor, favoring red and orange colors.

###### Combat

Kobolds are **weak warriors** and suffer a -1 damage penalty. Note that kobold champions, sub-chieftains, and chieftains do not suffer this penalty, and chieftains have a damage bonus (see below).

Unless special troops are present (p. XX), 50% of gangs or warbands encountered will be archers (round up), 50% will be warriors (round down). Most kobolds warriors are equipped with hide armor, shield, 3 javelins, and either a spiked club or hand axe. Kobold archers are equipped with leather armor, short bows, 20 arrows, and either a spiked club or hand axe.

###### Ecology

Each kobold gang will be led by one champion with 3 AC, 1-1 HD, and 4 hp. Each kobold warband will be led by a sub-chieftain with 4 AC, 1 HD, and 8 hp. A kobold lair or village will be led by a chieftain with 5 AC, 2 HD, 12 hp, and a +1 damage bonus. As long as the chieftain is alive, the kobolds will gain a +2 bonus to morale rolls.

Kobold lairs and villages will have drudges and whelps equal to 100% and 100% of the number of warriors, respectively. Kobold drudges and whelps have Spd 45’, AC 0, 1 hp, ML -4, and do not fight.

When kobolds are encountered in a village, certain additional creatures will be present. The chieftain will be defended by 5d4 guards (equivalent to champions statistically). There is a 60% chance a kobold village will be guarded 4d6 tokay gulls or 1d4 giant weasels. There is a 50% chance for 1d10 enslaved captives per warband. In addition, a kobold village has a 75% chance of a shaman being present, and a 50% chance of a witch doctor. A shaman is equivalent to a sub-chieftain statistically, but has Shaman abilities at level 1d6. A witch doctor is equivalent to a champion statistically, but has Mage abilities at level 1d4.

### Beastman, Orc

Orcs are grotesque beastmen bred as warriors from men and wild boars by the ancient Zaharans. They stand just over 6’ tall and weigh around 200 lbs, with pig-like faces, reddish eyes, black hair, and ochre to olive skin. Orcs prefer wearing vivid colors that many humans would consider unpleasant, such as blood red, mustard yellow, yellow-green, and deep purple. Orcs are exceedingly cruel, even by beastman standards, and delight in the torment and murder of others. They are also exceptionally greedy, which makes them particularly attractive to the chaotic rulers who hire orcs as mercenary soldiers.

###### Combat

Unless special troops are present (p. XX), 50% of gangs or warbands encountered will be archers (round up), 50% will be warriors (round down). Most orc warriors are equipped with leather armor, spear, short sword, and shield. Some orc tribes field warriors equipped with scale armor and pole arm. Most orc archers are equipped with scale armor, short bows, 20 arrows, and short sword. Some orc tribes field crossbowmen in lieu of archers, equipped with scale armor, crossbow, 20 bolts, and short sword.

###### Ecology

Each orc gang will be led by a champion with 4 AC, 1+1 HD, 8 hp, and a +1 damage bonus. Each orc warband will be led by a sub-chieftain with 5 AC, 2 HD, 12 hp, and a +1 damage bonus. An orc lair or village will be led by a chieftain with 6 AC, 4 HD, 20 hp, and a +2 damage bonus. As long as the chieftain is alive, the orcs will gain a +2 bonus to morale rolls.

Orc lairs and villages will have drudges and whelps equal to 100% and 200% of the number of warriors respectively. Orc drudges fight as kobolds. Orc whelps have Spd 90’, AC 0, 1 hp, ML -4, and do not fight.

When orcs are encountered in a village, certain additional creatures will be present. There is a 50% chance an orc village will be guarded by 1d4+1 ogres and a 60% chance it will be guarded by 2d4 giant boars. There is a 50% chance for 1d10 enslaved captives per warband. In addition, an orc village has a 75% chance of a shaman being present, and a 50% chance of a witch doctor. A shaman is equivalent to a sub-chieftain statistically, but has Shaman abilities at level 1d6. A witch doctor is equivalent to a champion statistically, but has Mage abilities at level 1d4.

### Beastman, Special Rules

The following rules summarize the organizational structure of beastmen as a whole and offer the Judge a number of options to customize their beastmen tribes and warbands. Since beastmen are a common foe for *ACKS* adventurers, it helps keep gameplay interesting to have different tribes be mechanically different.

###### Beastman Champions and Chieftains

Each beastman gang will be led by one a champion. Each warband will be led by a sub-chieftain. A beastman lair or village will be led by a chieftain. As long as the chieftain is alive, the beastmen will gain a +2 bonus to morale rolls. Champions, sub-chieftains, and chieftains have better AC, more HD and hit points, and damage bonuses. The leader characteristics for each breed are listed on the table below.

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Leader Type** | **Kobold** | **Goblin** | **Orc** |
| Champion | AC 3 (leather & shield)   * 1. HD, 4 hp   1d6 or by weapon | AC 3 (leather & shield)  1 HD, 7 hp  1d6 or by weapon | AC 4 (scale & shield)  1+1 HD, 8 hp  1d8 or by weapon +1 |
| Sub-Chieftain | AC 3 (leather & shield)  1 HD, 8 hp  1d6 or by weapon | AC 4 (scale & shield)  1+1 HD, 9 hp  1d8 or by weapon +1 | AC 5 (chain & shield)  2 HD, 12 hp  1d8 or by weapon +1 |
| Chieftain | AC 5 (chain & shield)  2 HD, 12 hp  1d8 or by weapon +1 | AC 6 (lamellar & shield)  3 HD, 16 hp  1d10 or by weapon +2 | AC 6 (lamellar & shield)  4 HD, 20 hp  1d10 or by weapon +2 |

###### Beastman Villages

When beastmen are encountered in a village, certain additional creatures might be present. These might include additional beastmen, trained beasts, and prisoners. Sometimes a shaman and/or witch-doctor might reside in the village. Shamans have the characteristics of sub-chieftains but can cast spells as shaman of a random level. Witch-doctors have the characteristics of champions but can cast spells as mages of a random level. Villages will always have female and juvenile beastmen equal to a percentage of the males. Smaller breeds of beastmen tend to have fewer juveniles because they grow to maturity more quickly. Female and juvenile beastmen either do not fight or fight as a smaller type of beastman. The table shows the make-up of each type of beastman village.

###### Beastman Special Troops (Optional)

Among the hosts of the beastmen can be found archers, warriors, and special troops – fearsome creatures bred and trained by their evil masters with special abilities and roles. If these optional rules are used, 40% of gangs or warbands encountered will be archers (round down), 40% will be warriors (round down), and the remaining 20% (rounded up) will be special troops. Roll 1d100 on the Beastman Special Troop table to determine their role. Champions will be the same role as their gang. Sub-chieftains will be the same role as their warband. A village’s chieftain will be of one of the roles of its warbands.

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Role** | **Kobold** | **Goblin** | **Orc** | **Hobgoblin** | **Gnoll** | **Bugbear** |

| Hunter | 1-30 | 1-25 | 21-30 | 11-20 | 21-40 | 21-45 |
| Sapper | 31-40 | 26-35 | 31-40 | 21-30 | 41-45 | 46-50 |
| Scout | 41-70 | 36-60 | 41-50 | 36-45 | 46-65 | 51-60 |
| Shocktrooper | - | - | 51-70 | 46-70 | 66-70 | 61-85 |
| Tracker | 71-90 | 61-70 | 71-80 | 71-80 | 71-90 | 86-95 |
| Beast Rider | 91-100 | 71-100 | 81-100 | 81-100 | 91-100 | 96-100 |

**Beast Riders:** Beast riders are warriors mounted on savage beasts. If any gangs within a warband are mounted, the sub-chieftain will be mounted, and if any warbands within a lair or village are mounted, the chieftain will be mounted. The exact creature ridden depends on the breed: kobolds ride giant weasels; goblins ride dire wolves; orcs ride giant boars; hobgoblins ride medium warhorses; gnolls ride giant hyenas; and bugbears ride cave bears.

**Berserkers:** Berserkers are **immune** to fear, and never retreat, surrender, or take prisoners unless ordered to do so by a powerful master. They add +2 to their attack throws due to their ferocity, but reduce their AC by 2. Berserkers are equipped as warriors but wear heavier armor (+1 AC) and carry two-handed weapons. 25% may be equipped with hooked weapons and/or barbed armor. Berserkers count as having one special ability (\*) for XP purposes.

**Hunters:** Hunters are **naturally stealthy** and opponents suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls. When attacking **vulnerable** enemies, they gain a +4 to attack throws and deal double the ordinary damage dice with melee weapons or missile weapons at short range. Hunters are equipped as archers of their breed.

**Sappers:** Sappers can build and use siege engineering equipment (as the proficiency). Sappers are equipped as archers of their breed, but 10% may carry blasting-fire bombs (see below).

**Scouts:** Scouts gain a +1 bonus to initiative and +1 bonus to avoid surprise. Scouts may withdraw or retreat from melee combat without declaring the intention to do so at the start of the melee round and do not suffer a penalty to AC when charging or running. Scouts are equipped as archers of their breed.

**Shocktroopers:** When a shocktrooper attempts to overrun an opponent, the normal penalty for attempting the maneuver is reduced by 2 (e.g. from -4 to -2), and his opponent suffers a -2 penalty to his saving throw to resist the special maneuver. Shocktroopers are equipped as warriors but wear heavier armor (+1 AC). 25% may wear barbed armor (see below).

**Trackers:** Trackers gain a +1 bonus to initiative and +1 bonus to avoid surprise. They can track (as the proficiency). Trackers are equipped as archers of their breed.

Beastman special troops are effectively elite troops (from *Axioms 4: War*). Elite troops are more effective in battle, and command a higher wage as a result. If beastman special troops are hired or fielded for use in large-scale battles or sieges, the following rules apply:

* Elite troops cost an additional 1gp per month for every 6gp of regular wage, with a minimum additional monthly wage of 3gp.
* Elite troops gain a +1 bonus to their attack throws during their battle turn (p. XX).

###### Beastmen Equipment (Optional)

If these optional rules are used, some beastmen might – depending on their breed, role, and rank – carry additional equipment ranging from blasting-fire bombs to whips.

**Barbed Armor:** Berserkers or shock troopers, and their champions, sub-chieftains, or chieftains, have a 25% chance to wear barbed armor. A beastman equipped with barbed armor deals an additional 1d4 {P} damage to any creature it overruns or wrestles. Barbed armor is painful to wear, and a human or demi-human wearing it fights as an unproficient 0th level characters.

**Blasting-Fire Bomb:** Goblin, kobold, orc, hobgoblin, gnoll, and bugbear sappers may carry blasting-fire bombs of 1lb, 1lb, 6lb, 6lb, 18lb, and 40lb size respectively. 10% of sappers carry blasting-fire bombs instead of bows. Blasting-fire bombs are crude petards used to breach stronghold walls. Petards have a slow fuse that must be lit with a match, a risky proposition. Lighting the fuse requires a movement action. The sapper must make a Siege Engineering proficiency throw of 6+.

A successful throw indicates the petard will detonate at the end of the sapper’s initiative in 1d4 rounds. A failed throw indicates the fuse has not been lit. A fumble occurs if the proficiency throw is an unmodified 1. A fumble results in the immediate detonation of the blasting-fire bomb.

When detonated, a 1lb bomb deals 1d6 {F!} {Se!}to all creatures with 5’. A 6lb bomb deals 2d6 {F!} {Se!} damage to all creatures within 10’. An 18lb bomb deals 3d6 {F!} {Se!} damage to all creatures within 15’. A 40lb bomb deals 4d6 {F!} {Se!} damage to all creatures within 20’. Affected creatures can make a Blast saving throw to reduce the damage by half. Blasting-fire bombs also deal full damage to the structural hit points of ships and buildings in the area of effect.

**Cruel Whip:** Sub-chieftains, chieftains, shamans, or witch-doctors have a 5% chance per Hit Die of carrying a cruel whip. Cracking a cruel whip is an action in lieu of attacking that **encourages** all subordinate orcs within 15’. Encouraged orcs gain +1 damage on their next attack.

**Dread Banner:** Sub-chieftains, chieftains, shamans, or witch-doctors may carry dread banners. Raising a dread banner is an action in lieu of attacking.

A creature which starts its initiative, or moves within, 60’ of a raised dread banner must make a Paralysis saving throw. If the save succeeds, the creature gains immunity to the effects of every dread banner on the battlefield for 1 turn. If the save fails, the creature becomes **shaken** until the start of its next initiative. A shaken creature suffers a -1 penalty to attack throws, armor class, morale rolls, and saving throws against fear. The condition is immediately ended if the banner is lowered or the orc carrying it is slain. Each orc village has a 20% chance of having a dread banner.

**Flask of Grog.** Sub-chieftains, chieftains, shamans, and witch doctors have a 5% chance per Hit Die of carrying a flask of grog. Grog is a foul-tasting but invigorating brew. Taking a swig of grog heals a beastman of 1d3 hp. Taking a swig of grog causes a human or demi-human to make a Death save. If the save fails, the creature begins **vomiting** until the end of its next initiative. If the save succeeds, the creature heals 1d3 hp. A beastman’s flask of grog is broken when the orc is slain. If somehow recovered, a flask will contain 1d4 swigs.

**Flesh-Runes:** Sub-chieftains, chieftains, shamans, and witch doctors have a 5% chance per Hit Die of being scarred or tattooed with flesh-runes. Flesh-runes grant a +1 bonus to AC and reduce mundane damage taken by 1 point per die.

**Hooked Weapons.** Berserkers and their champions, sub-chieftains, or chieftains have a 25% chance to carry hooked weapons. When an orc equipped with a hooked weapon attempts to disarm an opponent, the normal penalty for attempting the maneuver is reduced by 2 (e.g. from -4 to -2), and his opponent suffers a -2 penalty to his saving throw to resist the special maneuver.

**Poisoned Arrows:** Any orc archer may carry poisoned arrows. A creature struck by a poisoned arrow must make a saving throw versus Poison at +2 or suffer 1d6 {Po} damage after 1 turn. Each gang of archers encountered has a 5% per Hit Die of being equipped with poison arrows. Each warband encountered has a 5% chance per Hit Die to have its archers equipped with poison arrows. If a gang is equipped with poison arrows, its champion will be. If any gangs in a warband are equipped with poisoned arrows, the sub-chieftain will be, and if any warbands within a lair or village are equipped with poisoned arrows the chief will be, too.

**War-Drums:** Sub-chieftains, chieftains, shamans, or witch-doctors may carry war-drums. Playing a war-drum is an action in lieu of attacking. Orcs gain a +1 bonus to armor class, attack throws, morale rolls, and saving throws against magical fear while they can hear at least one war-drum from their warband or village within 60’. Each orc warband has a 20% chance of having a war-drum.

###### Beastman Tribal Traits (Optional)

Over the thousands of years since they were created, beastmen have devolved into hundreds of clans and tribes with their own traditions and traits. If these optional rules are used, the Judge should choose or roll 1d10 on the Trait table below for each separate beastman warband or village.

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Trait** | **Kobold** | **Goblin** | **Orc** | **Hobgoblin** | **Gnoll** | **Bugbear** |
| Bestial | 1-2 | 1-2 | 1 | - | 1 | 1 |
| Bullying | 3 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 2 |
| Cannibalistic | 4 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 3-4 | 3 |
| Fierce | - | - | 4 | 3-4 | 5 | 4-5 |
| Martial | - | - | 5 | 5-6 | - | - |
| Marauding | - | 5 | 6 | 7 | 6-7 | 6 |
| Mewling | 5-8 | 6-7 | 7 | - | - | - |
| Proud | - | - | 8 | 8-9 | 8 | 7-8 |
| Skilled | - | 8 | 9 | 10 | 9 | 9 |
| Unclean | 9-10 | 9-10 | 10 | - | 10 | 10 |

**Bestial:** The beastmen of this warband have particularly beast-like features, with clawed nails, fangs that have grown into prominent tusks and bestial gaits. Bestial beastmen can attack with two claws and bite. Kobolds and goblins deal 1d2-1/1d2-1/1d3-1 slashing damage with their claws and bite; orcs deal 1/1/1d2 slashing damage; gnolls deal 1d2/1d2/1d3 slashing damage; bugbears deal 1d2/1d2/1d4. Hobgoblins are never bestial.

**Bullying:** The beastmen of this warband are vicious when they have the upper hand, and dastardly when they don’t. A bullying beastman gains a +1 to all attack throws and damage rolls if its allies outnumber their opponents by 2:1 or more. However, a bullying beastman suffers a -1 penalty to morale rolls anytime its opponents outnumber its allies.

**Cannibalistic:** The beastmen of this warband are eager to eat the dead. Anytime a cannibalistic beastman incapacitates an opponent, it stops to feed in lieu of cleaving. If the beastman is no longer engaged by any other opponent, it automatically hits and instantly kills the incapacitated opponent. Otherwise it attacks the incapacitated target with a +2 bonus to its attack throw.

**Fierce:** The beastmen of this warband attack with loud battle cries and impetuous bravery. Fierce beastmen gain a +2 bonus to attack throws on the first round of combat. Kobolds and goblins are never fierce.

**Martial:** The beastmen of this warband have a long military tradition that dates back to the Zaharan wars of conquest. Ancient battle techniques are still handed down by word of mouth in the tribe. Martial beastmen gain a +1 bonus to damage. Chieftains of martial beastmen gain a +2 bonus to their strategic ability (or, if using monstrous proficiencies, gain two ranks of Military Strategy).

**Marauding:** The beastmen of this warband are skilled raiders and pillagers. Marauding beastmen increase the amount of special treasure rolled by 10% per warband. (Special treasure includes any treasure other than coin, gems, and jewelry.) They are served by an additional 4d6 HD of beasts appropriate to their breed per warband. Kobolds are never marauding.

**Mewling:** The beastmen of this warband are simpering cowards. Mewling beastmen suffer a -2 penalty to morale but can withdraw or retreat from melee combat without declaring the intention to do so at the start of the melee round. They do not suffer a penalty to AC when running. Hobgoblins, gnolls, and bugbears are never mewling.

**Proud:** The beastmen of this warband have a long martial tradition. Proud beastmen gain a +2 bonus to morale. Kobolds and goblins are never proud.

**Skilled:** The beastmen of this warband are highly proficient in the smithing of arms and armor. All warriors, champions, sub-chieftains, and chieftains are equipped with heavier armor than standard for their breed, granting +1 AC. Kobolds are never skilled.

**Unclean:** The beastmen of this warband are especially loathsome and foul. A demi-human or human that begins its initiative engaged by an unclear beastman, or that becomes engaged to one during its initiative, must make a Death saving throw. If the save succeeds, the creature is not affected and does not have to save again for one turn. If the save fails, the creature becomes **queasy** for one turn (10 minutes). Hobgoblins are never unclean.

### Bee, Giant Killer

Giant killer bees were first created millennia ago by feeding a queen bee with honey made from cacodemon ichor. They are highly aggressive social insects that dwell in huge underground hives. The worker bees are the most commonly encountered, as they will travel as far as 3 miles from their hives in search of forage. A typical worker bee has a length of 12” and weight of 3 lbs.

###### Combat

Giant killer bees are prone to attack anything they deem a threat, so characters encountering them out foraging suffer a -4 penalty on their reaction rolls. Characters encountering them near their hive (within 150’) automatically suffer Hostile reactions and will be pursued for up to 10 rounds. Giant killer bees never check morale so long as any characters are near the hive.

Giant killer bees have **acute olfaction** and gain a +1 bonus to avoid surprise in its natural habitat. They can “see” by means of **aerial mechanoreception** (60’).

If a worker bee damages a character with its sting attack, it delivers a dose of **deadly poison** and then pulls away, leaving its stinger lodged in the character. The stung character must make a Death saving throw. If the save fails, the character dies at the end of the bee’s initiative. Even if the save succeeds, the stinger deals an additional 1 {P} damage each round at the start of the character’s initiative until removed. Removing the stinger is a full-round action. The worker bee itself dies at the end of the round in which it successfully stings.

###### Ecology

Each giant killer bee hive is led by a queen bee (18” long, 8 lbs). The queen’s stinger does not stay lodged in her targets, so she can sting repeatedly without dying. The queen is always protected by 10 drones (15” long and 5 lbs). Neither the queen nor the drones will pursue characters outside of the nest.

Each hive always contains 1d8+1 larvae and 1d4 eggs. Larva have AC 0, Spd 15’, 1 hp, ML -4, and do not fight. Eggs have 1 hp and weigh 1/100 st.

###### Spoils

Giant killer bee hives contain a special type of honey with healing properties. Eating a pint of this healing honey (1 item) will cure 1d4 damage. Each hive yields 1d4 pints of healing honey. It takes one turn to harvest each pint.

A slain giant killer bee can be harvested with Animal Husbandry 2 for the following components useful in magic research:

* stinger (1/6 st., 6gp, *cure injury* (all)*, neutralize poison, poison*)

If not used for magic research, a giant killer bee’s stinger fetches 3gp. Its venom (onset time 1 turn, +2 saving modifier, 1d4 {Po} damage on failed Death saving throw) fetches 75gp and weighs 1/6 st. A bee that has stung has neither!

### Beetle, Giant Bombardier

The giant bombardier beetle is a gargantuan version of the ordinary bombardier beetle found throughout Aurëpos. These subterranean nocturnal insects are about 3’ long, with immense horn-like mandibles and a bulky 130 lbs build.

###### Combat

Giant bombardier beetles have **terrestrial mechanoreception** enabling them to sense vibration in the ground over long distances equivalent to line of sight in full daylight. Spells or effects that would ordinarily cause blindness do not affect the beetle when its using terrestrial mechanoreception. However, creatures that are flying, levitating, or otherwise not touching the ground are invisible to the sense. Terrestrial mechanoreception can penetrate structures and terrain features.

The bite of a bombardier beetles is not as strong as those of other giant beetles, though it can still grievously wound or kill an ordinary man.

However, in lieu of attacking withs bite, a bombardier beetle can spray toxic fluid at an opponent within 5'. If the toxic fluid hits, the opponent becomes **queasy** until the fluid is washed off or a *cure injury* spell ends the condition. Washing off the fluid requires one turn and consumes a waterskin of water.

###### Ecology

When a nest of bombardier beetles is encountered, there is a 7% chance per beetle that it will be incubating a clutch of 2d6 eggs. The eggs have 1 hp and weight 1/20 st. Beetle larvae are rarely found in nests, because the larvae immediately disperse into the wild after they emerge from their eggs.

###### Spoils

A slain bombardier beetle can be harvested with Animal Husbandry 2 for the following component:

* toxin vestibule (2/6 st, 20gp, *rain of vitriol, vitriolic infusion*)

###### Encounter

Erupting from the ground here is a giant anthill, 45’ in diameter and 30’ tall. The side of the anthill has been burned open, as if by acid. The 7’ wide gash gives access to a twisting warren of passages each 2-8’ in diameter, occasionally (20%) punctuated by 5-20’ square rooms. The giant ants that built the hill have since migrated elsewhere, and the anthill is now the nest of **seven giant bombardier beetles**.

**Giant bombardier beetles (7):** Spd 120’, AC 5, HD 2, hp 13, 13, 12, 10, 10, 9, 7, #AT 1 (bite or spray 9+), Dmg 1d6 {P} or toxic spray, Save F1, ML 0, AL N, XP 20; Special: toxic spray

Buried inside the anthill is a small wrought gold ring (200gp) that the ants had carried into the lair before their migration.

### Beetle, Giant Luminous

The giant luminous beetle is one of the most commonly encountered of the gargantuan beetles that plague Aurëpos. These subterranean nocturnal insects are about 2 ½' in length and 75 lbs in weight and are named for the luminescent organs that adorn it, two on the head and one on the abdomen. The luminescent organs produce illumination within a 10' radius each.

###### Combat

Giant luminous beetles have **terrestrial mechanoreception** enabling them to sense vibration in the ground over long distances equivalent to line of sight in full daylight. Spells or effects that would ordinarily cause blindness do not affect the beetle when its using terrestrial mechanoreception. However, creatures that are flying, levitating, or otherwise not touching the ground are invisible to the sense. Terrestrial mechanoreception can penetrate structures and terrain features.

Though not particularly aggressive, giant luminous beetles are immensely strong for their body weight. A single bite of their razor-sharp mandibles can slay an ordinary man.

###### Ecology

When a nest of luminous beetles is encountered, there is a 10% chance per beetle that it will be incubating a clutch of 2d6 eggs. The eggs have 1 hp and weigh 1/30 st. Beetle larvae are rarely found in nests, because the larvae immediately disperse into the wild after they emerge from their eggs.

###### Spoils

A slain luminous beetle can be harvested with Animal Husbandry 2 for the following components useful in magic research:

* tumescent organs (1/6 st, 15gp, *illumination, kindle flame, perpetual illumination*)

If not used for magic research, the luminous beetles fetch 5gp and weigh 1/6 st. In either case, the luminescent organs will continue to shed light for 1d6 days after being harvested.

###### Encounter

A mighty cedar tree, its trunk about 120’ in length and 7’ in diameter at its base, lies in the grass here, felled by a lightning bolt. Troops of mushrooms sprout from the rotting wood along its length. A hollow has been bored into the base of the trunk, from which a fiery glow flickers eerily. The source of the glow is the **eight giant luminous beetles** which have made a nest in the tree trunk.

**Giant luminous beetles (8)**: Spd 120’, AC 5, HD 1+2, hp 10, 10, 9, 7, 7, 5, 5, 4, #AT 1 (bite 9+), Dmg 2d4 {P}, Save F1, ML -1, AL N, XP 15

Scattered around the shattered tree are seven pieces of fulgurite (10gp each), a glassy gemstone created by the lightning strike.

### Beetle, Giant Tiger

These carnivorous monstrosities can measure up to 5' long and can weigh as much as 600 lbs. Their black carapaces are decorated with yellow stripes, the pattern somewhat resembling the hide of a tiger. Though they typically prey on other giant insects, giant tiger beetles can and do hunt and devour large mammals, including humanoids.

###### Combat

Giant tiger beetles have **terrestrial mechanoreception** enabling them to sense vibration in the ground over long distances equivalent to line of sight in full daylight. Spells or effects that would ordinarily cause blindness do not affect the beetle when its using terrestrial mechanoreception. However, creatures that are flying, levitating, or otherwise not touching the ground are invisible to the sense. Terrestrial mechanoreception can penetrate structures and terrain features.

Giant tiger beetles are immensely strong even for beetles. In combat, they attack using their razor-sharp mandibles for deadly effect.

###### Ecology

When a nest of giant tiger beetles is encountered, there is a 7% chance per beetle that it will be incubating a clutch of 2d6 eggs. The eggs have 1 hp and weigh 2/6 st. Beetle larvae are rarely found in nests, because the larvae immediately disperse into the wild after they emerge from their eggs.

###### Spoils

A slain giant tiger beetle can be harvested with Animal Husbandry 2 for the following component:

* chitinous spurs (1 stone, 65gp, armor +2, weapon +1)

A giant tiger beetle's two largest mandibles fetch 6sp each. Its armored hide fetches 25gp and weighs 1 4/6 st.

###### Encounter

A large mound of earth ahead is pocketed with six tunnel mouths, each 2’-5’ in diameter. The tunnels look to have been burrowed by a pony-sized animal, perhaps a giant weasel. The tunnels are each 10-30’ long, all terminating in a central 30’ square room occupied by **four giant tiger beetles**. These carnivorous insects devoured the prior denizens, and now nest within.

**Giant tiger beetles (4):** Spd 150’, AC 6, HD 3+1, hp 21, 20, 19, 15, #AT 1 (bite 7+), Dmg 2d6 {P}, Save F1, ML +1, AL N, XP 65

The interior of the tunnels is littered with the remains of prey. All of the remains are just bones, except for the gruesomely masticated cadaver of an explorer. The explorer’s backpack holds two bundles of weasel fur pelts (15gp, 3 st each). The explorer’s hand is missing; wrapped around the wrist of the stump are six scrimshaw bracelets (20gp each).

### Blob, Black

The dreaded black blob is a giant amoeba resembling a gooey mound of congealed pudding around 4’ tall, 20’ in diameter and 50,000 lbs in weight. Mindless and all-devouring, a black blob oozes through its environment to consume everything in its path. It can move along floors, walls, and ceilings with equal ease, undulate through water, and can ooze through tiny fissures in stone or narrow gaps in doorways.

###### Combat

Black blobs have **terrestrial mechanoreception** enabling them to sense vibration in the ground over long distances equivalent to line of sight in full daylight. However, creatures that are flying, levitating, or otherwise not touching the ground are invisible to the sense.

A black blob is immune to enchantment effects and to acidic, arcane, bludgeoning, cold, electrical, luminous, necrotic, piercing, poisonous, seismic, and slashing damage. Only fire can truly harm a black blob, but certain other damage types can affect it temporarily:

* If hit with cold damage, the black blob will be **paralyzed** for one round per die of damage the attack would normally deal.
* If hit by electrical or seismic damage, the black blob will be blown apart and seemingly destroyed, only to reform unharmed at the start of its next initiative.
* If hit with slashing damage, the black blob will be split into two smaller blobs. The Judge can divide the original black blob’s Hit Dice and current hp between the two however he sees fit, with the limitation that no black blob can have fewer than 2 Hit Dice. A blob with 2 – 4 HD only deals 1d8 damage, while a blob with 5 – 7 HD deals 2d8. A black blob of 2 HD treats slashing damage as seismic damage. The black blobs can congeal back into one blob as a full-round action. Blobs that congeal add their current hp together.

A black blob deals {A!} damage that can digest both metal and wood, but not stone. Any creature reduced to 0 hp or fewer by a black blob is immediately slain and its body dissolved.

###### Ecology

Black blobs can be found anywhere there is organic matter for them to feed on, but are most common in stone dungeons, whose confines become their feeding grounds.

A black blob reproduces by budding, detaching a newborn black blip (baby) each time it consumes 50,000 lbs of organic matter.

###### Spoils

A slain black blob can be harvested with the Alchemy proficiency for the following component:

* Burnt remnants (37 3/6 st, 2250gp, *disintegration, energy invulnerability* *(all except fire), physical* invulnerability (all))

### Blood Hound

A blood hound is a necromantic attack beast created from a lithe human corpse. With its skin stripped to ease movement and entrails removed to reduce weight, the corpse’s arm and leg joints are twisted and re-set, permitting the blood hound to crawl swift and low to the ground. The tongue is set with a hollow tip of sharp bone, and reattached with its base inside the mouth rather than down the throat; this, gives the blood hound a piercing tongue attack that it can use in close quarters. The tongue is also used to drain a victim's blood, replenishing it's necrotic flesh and permitting it to retain its flexibility.

###### Combat

Blood hounds have **acute olfaction** and gain a +1 bonus to avoid surprise in its natural habitat. They can track the scent of creatures for up to 6 miles with the equivalent of three ranks of Tracking proficiency.

When they reach their prey, blood hounds claw with ragged, filthy, bone-like talons and lash with their spiky tongues. A blood hound can use its tongue attack to deal damage or to make a **Knockdown** special maneuver using Combat Trickery (Knockdown). If the blood hound damages a living creature with its tongue attack, the tongue attaches to the creature struck and begins to **drain its blood**.

Thereafter the blood hound can automatically deal 1d4 {N} damage to the creature each round without having to make an attack throw. Doing so counts as the blood hound’s attack with the tongue. Creatures that are having their blood drained by a blood hound can still move, but count as carrying 12 extra stone of encumbrance. The blood hound moves with the creature it is drinking blood from.

A creature can only escape or be freed from the tongue by killing the blood hound or severing the tongue. To cut the tongue, a creature must deal 4 or more slashing damage to it in one blow. (Any damage dealt beyond 4 points is not dealt to the blood hound.) If the tongue is severed, the blood hound can no longer make tongue attacks.

Like all undead, blood hounds are immune to enchantment effects, necrotic damage, and poisonous damage. They are rebuked as ghouls.

###### Ecology

Creations of the blackest necromancy, blood hounds can be found guarding sanctums, temples, and tombs, or roaming the wild in an endless macabre hunt.

###### Spoils

A destroyed blood hound can be harvested with Healing 2 for the following components useful in magic research:

* skull (2/6 st, 19gp, *deathless minion, unliving puppet*)
* tongue bone (2/6 st, 19gp, *life transfer, earth’s excrescence, earth’s wave*)

### Boar, Common

Adaptable, cunning, and hardy, wild boars are found throughout the woodlands of Aurëpos. An ordinary wild boar is about 5’ long and weighs about 375 lbs.

###### Combat

Common boars have **acute hearing** and **acute olfaction.** They gain a +2 bonus to avoid surprise in their natural habitat. They can track the scent of creatures for up to 4 miles with the equivalent of two ranks of Tracking proficiency.

Though cantankerous, common boars do not generally attack man-sized creatures, unless defending their young. If they do attack, they use their great tusks to rend and gore their targets.

###### Ecology

When common boars are encountered in their den, the boars will be rearing 3d6-3 juvenile boars and 2d6-2 baby boars. Juvenile boars have AC 0, Spd 120’, HD 1+2, and attack with stubby tusks (1d3 {P}). Baby boars have AC -1, Spd 120’, HD 1, and attack with head butts (1{P}).

###### Spoils

A slain boar with exceptional attributes can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following component:

* tusks (50gp, 5/6 st, *curse of the swine,* armor +1)

If not used for magic research, a wild boar’s two tusks fetch 1gp and weigh 1/6 st each.

###### Lore

*The traditional manner of cooking wild boar is as follows. First, the boar is flensed of hair and skin, then sponged clean. Next, it is sprinkled with coarse salt and roasted cumin. It is then left to stand overnight to enable the seasoning to flavor the meat.*

*The following day, the boar is wrapped in sliced bacon or pork caul. Then it is placed within a brick oven, preferably fired with apple wood, which adds a sweet and fruity flavor to the game. The boar is then roasted for one hour per stone of weight.*

*While the boar roasts, the sweet sauce is prepared. To begin, a pint of unmixed dry wine is boiled until only half remains. To this reduced wine are added 2 tablespoons of honey and a half-pint of sweet wine made from dried grapes. The admixture is then seasoned with pepper.*

*When the boar is finished roasting, it is removed from the oven and glazed with the sweet sauce until the boar flesh has a caramel finish. Finally, the boar meat is carve into thin slices and served alongside any remaining sauce.*

* Apicius*, On the Preparation of Feasts*

### Boar, Giant

These giant cousins of ordinary boars are 7’ to 10’ long and weigh about 930 lbs. They are much more aggressive, cunning, and predatory than the ordinary breeds. Orcs (which were bred from boars) have a special affinity for them, and often use giant boards as mounts in battle.

Giant boars are much smarter than ordinary boars. However, they are much slower to grow and eat much more food than ordinary boars, so giant piglets are actually worth less than common as piglets.

Whether in the wild or with orcs, giant boars crave the meat of humanoids, and will attack them with little to no provocation. Humanoids other than orcs that encounter giant boars suffer a -2 penalty to their reaction rolls.

###### Combat

Like ordinary boars, giant boars have **acute hearing** and **acute olfaction.** They gain a +2 bonus to avoid surprise in their natural habitat. They can track the scent of creatures for up to 4 miles with the equivalent of two ranks of Tracking proficiency.

In combat, giant boars gore their targets with their mighty tusks for 3d4 {P} damage.

###### Ecology

When giant boars are encountered in their den, the giant boars will be rearing 2d4 juvenile boars and 1d4 baby boars. Juvenile giant boars have AC 1, Spd 90’, HD 2+2, and attack with stubby tusks (1d6 {P}). Baby giant boars have AC 0, Spd 90’, HD 1+1, and attack with head butts (1d2 {B}).

###### Spoils

A slain giant boar can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following component:

* tusks (3 2/6 st, 200gp, *curse of swine, righteous wrath,* armor +1)

If not used for magic research, a giant boar’s two tusks fetch 2gp and weigh 1/6 st each. Its pelt fetches 80gp and weighs 2 3/6 st.

###### Encounter

A shrub thicket has become the shelter of a family of **two giant boar**, **four juvenile boars**, and **two baby boars**. The boars have dragged broken branches and grasses to form a ground cover, and dug down to cover themselves with soil and pine needles. The tough old boar who leads the family has a leather collar around his neck, moldy and rotten. The boar and the oldest sow have both been branded with an orcish sigil, “Urtyarg.”

### Bronze Bull

A bronze bull is a powerful construct resembling a giant horned bull with a brazen hide and iron horns. Within its interior burns a furnace of elemental fire. Whisps of smoke continuously trail from its brazen nostrils, and from its mouth belches blazing and terrible fire. Standing over 7' tall at the shoulder and measuring 9' from snout to tail, the bronze bull weighs about 10,000lb.

###### Combat

In combat, a bronze bull can gore targets with its horns for 5d6 {P!} damage or use its **fire breath**. The fire breath forms a cone 60' long and 30' wide at its terminal end. Each creature within the cone must make a Blast saving throw. If the save fails, the creature suffers 10d6 {F!} damage. If the save succeeds, the creature suffers half that damage. After breathing fire, the bronze bull’s furnace is temporarily dimmed. It takes 1d6 rounds before the furnace re-heats sufficiently to allow it to breath fire again.

A bronze bull is **immune** to enchantment effects and to fire, necrotic, and poisonous damage. If the bronze bull suffers piercing or slashing damage in melee, the creature that dealt the damage must make a Blast saving throw. If the save succeeds, there is no effect. If the save fails, the creature suffers 1d6 {F!} damage as some of the **elemental fire** within the bull gushes over it.

As constructs, bronze bulls count as enchanted creatures for purposes of spells such as *dispel evil*and *holy circle*.

###### Ecology

As magical constructs, bronze bulls have no natural habitat. They are usually constructed as beasts of burden or war-mounts for powerful spellcasters.

###### Spoils

A destroyed bronze bull can be harvested with Magical Engineering for the following component:

* bronze hooves (37 3/6 st., 2,250gp, any elemental fire effect, armor +2)

A bronze bull’s two horns each fetch 1d10x50gp and weigh 1 st per 60gp value.

###### Lore

*Now Aenon, having saddled the winged pegasus and calmed the raging chimera, became acclaimed as the finest tamer of animals in all Nicea. Queen Jocia, seeing the rising fame of Aenon, knew him as a threat to her rule; and so she demanded that he prove his prowess by yoking her untamable bronze-hooved bulls. These were no ordinary bulls, but rather immense brazen beasts which belched all-consuming fire.*

*Had Aenon approached the bulls unprepared, he surely would have been sent to a fiery grave; but just before the moment of his approach, he rubbed an oil on his shield, spear, and body, which the magi Nicodos had promised would make him invulnerable to the bull’s fire…*

* Thalosides, *Mythos*

### Cacodemon

Cacodemons are living horrors from the Outer Darkness brought to our world by black magic, evil prayer, or terrible suffering and calamity. Utterly alien and unspeakably vile, they have been known to mankind by many names: gremlin, incubus, demon, devil, fiend. Civilized adults, living in the safe realms of Law, may dismiss cacodemons as mere myths and legends, but the learned must endure the terror of knowing they are real.

Cacodemons range in power from chaotic spawn, no more fearsome than a gnoll, to archfiends capable of destroying dragons. Demonologists have codified this range into ten different **ranks**. Many of a cacodemon’s characteristics primarily depend on its rank. See the Cacodemon Characteristics by Rank tables, below.

The appearance of cacodemons varies as much as their power. Some occultists argue that cacodemons have no true body form, and that it is the summoner’s will which imposes shape upon their formless souls. Others argue that as creatures of Chaos, cacodemons come in every body form imaginable. Whatever the case, a cacodemon’s speed and attack routine are determined by its **body form**, while its damage is determined by the intersection of its rank and body form. See the Cacodemon Characteristics by Body Form table, below.

Cacodemons are **resistant** to acidic, cold, electrical, fire, poisonous, and seismic damage. They have **lightless vision** (90’) and possess **telepathy** (as the spell) allowing them to communicate with any creatures they encounter. In addition, all cacodemons have at least two other special abilities, one of them often derived from their body form. High-ranking cacodemons may have as many as five special abilities. Refer to the Cacodemon Characteristics by Rank table for the number of special abilities the cacodemon receives. Winged cacodemons lose one special ability to compensate for flight.

Some cacodemons are capable of speech. The higher the rank of the cacodemon, the greater the probability that it has the capability of speech. Refer to the Cacodemon Characteristics by Rank table for the probability of speech. All cacodemons that can speak know Common and two other languages.

Cacodemons that speak can also cast arcane spells at a caster level of ½ their HD. The arcane spells per day available is determined by the cacodemon’s rank. Cacodemons always know the same number of arcane spells that they can cast per day. Their repertoire is innate and they have no need for spell formula or studying.

Different cacodemons favor different types of spells, but enchantments such as *dark whispers, incite madness, infuriate beast, inspire horror,* and *enslave*are common.

Cacodemons that can speak and cast spells should be counted as having two additional special abilities (\*\*) for purposes of XP. (This is already factored into the HD entry and XP awards for Fiends and Archfiends, which always can speak and cast spells). If all cacodemons are unintelligent creatures incapable of speech in the Judge’s campaign setting, then cacodemons who would be capable of speech should gain an additional two special abilities instead. Cacodemons will not cast spells when conjured or summoned unless they are Fiends or Archfiends.

Whatever their special abilities, cacodemons are unholy beings that can be detected with *discern evil*, held at bay by *holy circle,* dispelled with *counterspell* or *dispel magic,* destroyed with *dispel evil,* and rebuked as infernals.

Cacodemons most often appear in one of five basic body forms, each of which has winged and wingless variants, for a total of ten common body form configurations. These are:

**Arachnine:**Arachnine cacodemons resemble giant spiders, with chitinous segmented eight-legged bodies, fanged chelicerae, web-making spinnerets, and up to eight insect-like eyes. Winged arachnine cacodemons add a pair of dragonfly-like wings. A wingless arachnine has an encounter speed of 60’. A winged arachnine has an encounter speed of 60’ and a flying encounter speed of 120’. In either case, arachnines can climb at their land encounter speed. An arachnine cacodemon’s attack routine consists of a bite attack. Arachnine cacodemons may select the **poison** special ability if desired.

**Humanoid:** Humanoid cacodemons are bipedal, two-armed, two-legged creatures. Some are beautiful and majestic, resembling elves, men, or gods. Others are hideous to behold, resembling minotaurs, ogres, owlbears, or worse. If wings are present, they sprout from the shoulder blades; they are typically bat-like, but feathered avian wings and membranous insect wings are also possible. A wingless humanoid has an encounter speed of 120’. A winged humanoid has a land encounter speed of 90’ and a flying encounter speed of 240’. A humanoid’s attack routine consists of a pair of claw attacks and a bite attacks. Some humanoids may instead have a weapon attack, which deals damage as an arachnine bite attack.

**Monadine:** Monadine cacodemons appear as amorphous blobs of cytoplasmic ichor, capable of changing their shape, forming stalks, and extruding pseudopods. Some monadine cacodemons may have blinking eyes, agonized human faces, or pulsating organs visible on or within their cytoplasm. Wingless monadine have a land encounter speed of 30’. Winged monadine, capable of propelling themselves into the air and forming their bodies into a wing-like surface, gain a flying encounter speed of 60’. In either case, monadine cacodemons can climb and swim at their land encounter speed. A monadine’s attack routine consists of an envelopment by an extruded pseudopod. Monadine cacodemons may select the **swallow attack** special ability if desired.

**Scolopendrine:**Scolopendrine cacodemons resemble enormous carcass scavengers, with long segmented bodies with a pair of legs on every segment, terminating in a head festered with elongated mandibles and eight tentacle-like antenna. Wingless scolopendrine have an encounter speed of 120’. Winged scolopendrine gain a pair of membranous wings on every segment, granting a flying encounter speed of 180’. A scolopendrine’s attack routine consists of eight tentacle attacks and a bite attack. Scolopendrine cacodemons may select the **paralysis** special ability if desired.

**Wyverine:** Wyverine cacodemons have bipedal body forms with two vestigial arms (like a tyrannosaur). If wings are present, they replace the arms (like a bat or bird). A wingless wyverine cacodemon has an encounter speed of 120’, while a winged wyvernine cacodemon has a land encounter speed of 90’ and a flying encounter speed of 240’. A wyvern’s attack routine consists of either a bite and a tail attack or two talon attacks. Winged wyvernine cacodemons may select the **dive attack** special ability while wingless ones may select the **berserk** special ability.

To randomly determine a cacodemon’s body form, roll 1d10. 1-2, Arachnine; 3-4, Humanoid; 5-6, Monadine; 7-8 Scolopendrine; 9-10, Wyverine. If the roll is odd, it is a winged version of that body form. If the roll is even, it is the wingless form.

###### Cacodemon Size, Mass, and Carrying Capacity

A cacodemon’s mass (in pounds) is determined by its HD and its body mass exponent, according to the formula *mass = (HD x 10)BME*. The cacodemon’s weight then determines its carrying capacity and size category. Its carrying capacity is calculated according to the formula *carrying capacity = mass x CCF*. Size category is shown on the table below.

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Mass | 35 lbs or less | 36 to 400 lbs | 401 to 2,000 lbs | 2,001 to 8,000 lbs | 8,001 to 32,000 lbs | More than 32,000 lbs |
| Size Category | Small | Man-Sized | Large | Huge | Gigantic | Colossal |
| Length/Height | Less than 2’ long/tall | Less than 8’ long/tall | 8’ to 12’ long/tall | 12’ to 20’ long/tall | 20’ to 32’ long/tall | 32’ or more long/tall |

A cacodemons’s size category determines its height and length. Wingspans of winged cacodemons will typically be three times length. Being magical creatures, cacodemons do not suffer an AC penalty for size category. Some cacodemons may be lighter and smaller than their HD and BME would indicate (Judge’s choice), but they may not be larger.

###### Cacodemon Special Abilities

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Usage | Usage Factor | Usage | Usage Factor |
| At will | 1 | 1/day | 0.4 |
| 1/turn | 0.8 | 1/week | 0.3 |
| 1/3 turns | 0.7 | 1/month | 0.2 |
| 1/hour | 0.6 | 1/season | 0.1 |
| 3/day | 0.5 | 1/year | 0.05 |

The Judge may roll or select powers for the cacodemon from the list below, or make up his own. An \* indicates the power is worth one special ability, while a # indicates it is worth 1/8 special ability. The Judge should continue to roll or choose powers until the appropriate total number is chosen.

Spell-like special abilities count as fractions of a special ability each. Multiply ¼ x the level of the spell-like ability by the usage factor shown on the adjoining table.

EXAMPLE: A particular cacodemon can cast *illusion* at will (4th level, usage 1), *command word* at will (1st level, usage 1), *mirror image* once per day (2nd level, usage 0.4), and *bewitch humanoid* once per day (1st level, usage 0.4). Its spell-like abilities count as [ (1/4 x 4 x 1) + (1/4 x 1 x 1) + (1/4 x 2 x 0.4) + (1/4 x 1 x 0.4) ] 1.55 abilities, rounded to 2.

If the creature is already cowering or faltering, it is frightened instead. Creatures with class level or HD equal to or greater than ½ the cacodemon’s HD are immune to the dread. |
| 17-18 | Enervation (\*\*): A character damaged by the cacodemon’s primary attack reduces his maximum hp by the amount of damage dealt and becomes enervated. |
| 19-20 | Enslave (\*): The cacodemon can enslave victims to its will 3/day or by gaze. The target must succeed on a Spells save or be enslaved to the cacodemon. If the cacodemon has 3 HD or less, the save is at +2. If the cacodemon has 9 HD or more, the save is at -2. |
| 21-23 | Flying (####): The cacodemon is capable of flying at the speed noted for its body form. If it already flies, it becomes capable of making dive attacks that deal double damage.

However, if an incorporeal cacodemon has 4 HD or less, it considers damage dealt by silver weapons to be extraordinary damage. It can select enervation and flying as special abilities. |
| 39 | Infectious (##): The cacodemon is able to transform its victims into others of its kind or a lesser kind. Creatures slain by the cacodemon might rise as cacodemons of its type unless appropriate measures are taken; or victims suffering loss of half or more of their hit points to the cacodemon’s natural attacks might become a cacodemon of its type after 2d6 days. |
| 40-41 | Invisibility (\*): The cacodemon is naturally invisible. It may act freely, including attacking, without becoming visible. |
| 42-43 | Lightning Reflexes (##): The cacodemon is extremely fast, and gains a +2 bonus to initiative. |

| 54-61 | Poison (\*): Creatures damaged by the cacodemon’s primary attack(s) must make successful Death save or be poisoned. Roll 1d20 to determine onset time: 1-12, instant (at the end of the cacodemon’s initiative); 13-14, 1 turn; 15, 1d4 turns; 16-19 1d4+2 turns; 20, 1 d10 turns. Roll 1d20 to determine effect 1-16, death; 17-19: paralysis 2d4 turns + 1d6 damage per HD; 20: incapacitation. If the cacodemon has 3 HD or less, the save is at +2. If the cacodemon has 9 HD or more, the save is at -2. |
| 62-63 | Regeneration (\*): The cacodemon regenerates hit points each round, with the ability to re-attach lost limbs, unless the damage is of two particular types (usually fire and acid). The amount regenerated will be HD/2 per round. |

Aquatic mechanoreception is equal to its swimming encounter speed. |
| 70-71 | Spellcasting (\*\*): The cacodemon may cast spells as if it were a mage of the class level shown on the Cacodemon Primary Characteristics by Rank table. Re-roll if the cacodemon is already able to cast spells. |
| 72-75 | Spell-like Abilities (varies): The cacodemon gains 1d4 spell-like abilities. Generate the abilities as if rolling for spell scrolls or select appropriate abilities based on the cacodemon’s other powers (Judge’s choice). Each spell-like ability counts as a fraction of a special ability. Multiply 2 x spell level x the usage factor (see above). |
| 76-80 | Stealth (#): The cacodemon is difficult to notice. Characters encountering the cacodemon at any time suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls. |
| 81-83 | Swallow Attack (\*): The cacodemon can swallow whole victims two size categories smaller than itself on an unmodified attack throw of 20. A victim that is swallowed whole takes damage equal to the cacodemon’s HD each round until the cacodemon is killed or the victim dies. If the cacodemon is of gigantic size, it can swallow on 19-20; if of colossal size, on 18-20. If the cacodemon is not at least huge size, re-roll. |
| 84-86 | Swift (##): The cacodemon moves rapidly. Its speed is increased by 30’ for every 120’ of base encounter movement |
| 87-88 | Terrifying (\*): The cacodemon can cause panic and terror by taking a combat action. The area of effect is 100 square feet per HD. Each affected creature must succeed on a Paralysis save or become frightened. Creatures with class level or HD of ½ the cacodemon’s HD or less falter even if the save succeeds. |
| 89-91 | Topple and Fling (####): When the cacodemon hits with its primary attack, it can topple and fling creatures that are at least two size classes smaller than itself. The creature struck must make a size-adjusted Paralysis saving throw. If the save fails, the creature is knocked prone and forced back a number of feet equal to the damage dealt. If this would push the creature into a wall or other obstacle, the creature takes 1d6 {B} damage per 10’ he has traveled. If the cacodemon is not at least huge sized, re-roll. |
| 92-94 | Tough (varies): The cacodemon is unusually tough or hardy. Its AC is increased by 1d4 points. If this increases its AC to more than its HD x 1.5, this counts as a 1 special ability. Otherwise it counts as ¼ special ability. |
| 95-97 | Trample (##): The cacodemon gains a trample attack which it may use in lieu of its normal attack sequence. The trample attack should inflict an average of 2 hp of {B} damage per HD the cacodemon possesses. The cacodemon gains a +4 bonus to attack targets smaller than itself and can force back such creatures. If the cacodemon is not at least large sized, re-roll. |
| 98-99 | Vicious Attack (####): The cacodemon has a vicious attack. On an unmodified attack throw of 20, the creature struck by the attack must make a Death save. If the save succeeds, the creature suffers double damage. If the save fails, the creature suffers triple damage and has a limb broken. If the cacodemon is of gigantic size, it can dismember on 19-20; if of colossal size, on 18-20. If the cacodemon is not at least large sized, re-roll. |
| 100 | Unusual (\* or more): The cacodemon has a rare, unique, or special power determined by the Judge. If the Judge doesn’t have time to be creative, re-roll. |

### Camel

Camels are one- and two-humped mammals found throughout Opelenea, Kemesh, Shebatea, and the Waste. They are bred for use as war mounts or pack animals in arid environments.

###### Combat

Camels are **adapted to sand and heat**. Fully-nourished camels never become dehydrated provided they can drink their fill at least every six months. They ignore movement multipliers from barren or desert terrain. They can graze their full ration in barren or desert terrain as a dedicated activity, or as their ancillary activities if they move at half speed.

They also have **rugged endurance** (as Endurance proficiency) and can force march for one day without penalty, plus one additional day for each point of CON bonus.

A camel can attack with a toothy bite and a kick from its hoof. The bite is more annoying than dangerous but camel handlers soon learn that a camel’s kicks can be punishing.

Unlike war horses, war camels do not attack with their natural weapons when their rider charges.

###### Ecology

When a caravan of wild camels is encountered, there is a 66% chance the caravan will be accompanied by 1d2 camel calves. Roll 1d4 for their age: on a 1 they’re baby camels, on 2-4 they’re juvenile camels. Juvenile camels have AC 0, Spd 120’, 1 HD, and attack with a hoof (1d2 {B!}). Baby camels have AC 0, Spd 120’, 1 hp, ML -4, and do not fight.

###### Spoils

A slain camel with exceptional attributes can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for:

* kidneys (2/6 st, 20gp, *create water, desiccate*)

Slower and surlier than horses, camels are difficult to train and unpleasant to ride. Nevertheless, they are invaluable mounts in in arid regions.

###### Lore

*For a journey of eight leagues, a man must carry a canteen. For a journey of eighty leagues, a camel must carry a man.*

* Besheradi proverb

*The cataphracts were little pleased with their new steeds, for the camel is the most accursed of all beasts -- misshapen and malevolent, spitting and spiteful, vicious and vile! Better to wrestle a feral ogre than ride a camel.*

* Legate Celic Ionicus, *Annals of the Opelenean War*

### Cairn Dwellers

Pot-bellied, pasty-faced humanoids with six-fingered hands and dull, flat nails, cairn dwellers are the remnants of a ruined legion that invaded Cybele long before the Day Without Night.

They hail from a foreign Sphere of Existence ruled by a cacodemon archfiend named Y’chal, The Echoing Lord, which sees itself as a great god-conqueror. To guarantee the victory of its invading legion, Y’chal blessed the cairn dwellers with immortal invulnerability. Whether it be burned to the bone, chopped into pieces or torn limb from limb, a cairn dweller simply cannot die.

Defeated and broken in long-forgotten battles, the cairn dwellers have come to fear the agony of their unceasing lives more than anything else. Now they try to trick the gods of Cybele into letting them them die so their souls can be reformed into new life. To this end, they take up residence in tumuli and barrows, leaving only to feed and to find material for the crude copies they make of the grave goods they discover within their sepulchral homes - false offerings they hope will please their unhearing saviors.

When not arranging and rearranging their worthless cult-objects - losing track of the real treasures amid their false ones - they often lay in the sarcophagus of the honored dead, draping themselves in burial shrouds or wearing the waxen death masks of the those whose resting places they defile.

Nearly every cairn dweller is both cowardly and insane.

###### Combat

All cairn dwellers are protected by permanent *necromantic invulnerability* (as the spell). In addition, cairn dwellers are immune to necrotic and poison damage and cannot be coup de graced. Thus, the only means to actually destroy one is a *disintegration* spell or ritual magic.

Cairn dwellers tend to wear strange cobbled-together armor that shields their faces, necks, and limbs, while leaving their torso and abdomens exposed. They equip themselves with whatever hand weapons they find as grave goods.

###### Ecology

Each cell will be led by a champion with 3 AC, 3 HD, 16 hp, and a +2 damage bonus. Each cohort will be led by a sub-commander with 4 AC, 4 HD, 20 hp, and a +2 damage bonus. A crypt or cairn will be led by a commander with 5 AC, 6 HD, 28 hp, and a +3 damage bonus.

Cairn dweller leaders usually suffer from gruesome disabilities. Roll 1d20+5 and 1d6 on the Mortal Wounds (Savage) table for each leader and apply those effects to it.

Cairn dwellers sometimes are armed with potent treasures found in their blasphemous dwellings. Leaders should also be assigned magic items by HD using the ***ACKS II JJ***rules (p. XX). The most dangerous few still possess the weapon they brought with them millennia ago — the thunder-lance. This whisker-thin rod of devastating power functions as a *wand of thunderbolts,* but possess only 1d4 charges remaining and no means of recharging. 10% of sub-commanders and 25% of commanders are armed with a thunder-lance.

### Carrion Horror

The carrion horror is a 4' tall and 9' long giant scolopendrine that resembles a huge centipede with multifaceted eyes, dozens of tiny legs, and an oversized head bearing eight 2' feelers tipped with venomous stingers. The origin of these creatures is unknown, for even the cultists of Iskara deny that the Mother of Monsters would make such an abomination.

###### Combat

Carrion horrors have **terrestrial mechanoreception** enabling them to sense vibration in the ground over long distances equivalent to line of sight in full daylight. Spells or effects that would ordinarily cause blindness do not affect the creature when using terrestrial mechanoreception. However, creatures that are flying, levitating, or otherwise not touching the ground are invisible to the sense. Terrestrial mechanoreception can penetrate structures and terrain features.

If a carrion horror damages a creature with a stinger, the creature must make a Paralysis save against its venom. If the save succeeds, the creature is unaffected by the poison. If the save fails, the creature is **paralyzed** at the end of the carrion horror’s initiative. A carrion horror’s paralysis can be cured with *cure injury* or *neutralize poison.* Otherwise, it lasts for 2d4 turns.

The carrion horror can instinctively identify when its venom has paralyzed a creature, enabling it to continue to attack an opponent that resists its venom or turn its attention to other threats if it succumbs.

If not engaged by another opponent, a carcass scavenger can devour a paralyzed creature of man-size or less as its combat action. Devoured creatures are instantly slain.

###### Ecology

When a nest of carrion horrors is encountered, there is a 7% chance per horror that it will be incubating a clutch of 1d10 eggs. The eggs have 1 hp and weigh 1/6 st. Carrion horror hatchlings are rarely found in nests, because the hatchlings immediately disperse into the wild after they emerge from their eggs.

###### Spoils

A slain carrion horror can be harvested with Animal Husbandry 2 for the following components useful in magic research:

* feelers (1 1/6 st, 70gp, *swift sword*)
* stinger tips (1 4/6 st, 100gp, *halt humanoid, halt monster*

If not used for magic research, a carrion horror’s eight stingers fetch 1gp and weigh 1/6 st each. Its venom (onset time 1 turn, +2 saving throw modifier, inflicts paralysis for 2d4 turns) fetches 300gp and weighs 1/6 st.

### Cat, Catamount

Catamounts are tawny-haired ambush predators found in the high meadows and lower slopes of the Jutting and Meniri Mountains as well as the forests of Northern and Southern Argollë.

Most catamounts avoid humans and demi-humans, attacking only if starving, provoked, or protecting young.

###### Combat

Catamounts have **acute hearing** and **acute olfaction.** They gain a +2 bonus to avoid surprise in their natural habitat. They can track the scent of creatures for up to 4 miles with the equivalent of two ranks of Tracking proficiency. They are **incredibly agile** (as Acrobatics proficiency at 7+) and **skilled climbers**, able to ascend sheer surfaces as if they were thieves (5+).

Their **lightning reflexes** grant a +1 bonus to initiative. They are **naturally stealthy** when in their native habitat, and creatures encountering them suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls.

If a catamount charges a creature or leaps over it (using Acrobatics), and successfully hits it with both claws, it immediately **pounces** onthe creature. The catamount’s subsequent bite attack automatically hits and the creature that has been pounced on must make a successful size-adjusted Paralysis saving throw or be knocked **prone**.

###### Ecology

When catamounts are encountered in a wilderness den, there is a 50% chance the catamounts will be rearing catamount cubs. Roll 1d6 for age and number: 1-3 it’s 1d2 juvenile catamounts, 4-6 it’s 1d4 baby catamounts. Juvenile catamounts have AC 2, Spd 180’, HD 1+3, and attack with 2 claws (1 {S}) and a bite (1d3 {P}). Baby catamounts have AC 1, Spd 180’, HD 1, and attack with a fierce nibble (1 {P}).

###### Spoils

A slain catamount with exceptional attributes can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following component:

* tongue (1 4/6 st, 100gp, *call of the great cats, silent step*)

A catamount's pelt fetches 25gp and weighs 4/6 st.

Catamounts are relatively easy to tame and train compared to their larger cousins, but are not as popular as the speedy cheetahs or majestic lions.

###### Encounter

48’ up a steep slope, a small rock outcropping protected by a long rocky overhang is serving as a sheltered den for a **catamount** along with her **three baby cubs**.

Catamount: Spd 210’, AC 3, HD 3+2, hp 19, #AT 3 (2 claws/bite 7+), Dmg 1d3 {S} /1d3 {S} / 1d6 {P} , Save F2, ML 0, AL N, XP 100

###### Note

Catamount is an old European term for ‘mountain cat.” The catamount in the Auran Empire setting is analogous to the now-extinct *Panthera pardoides*, also known as the European jaguar and Ostend panther. It can also be used to represent the North American cougar.

### Cat, Cheetah

Cheetahs are spotted chase predators found in the grasslands of Somirea, Kemesh, Opelenea, and Ulruk. A typical specimen measures about 4’ in length and 100 lbs in weight.

Cheetahs avoid humans and demi-humans when possible.

###### Combat

Cheetahs have **acute vision**, **hearing** and **olfaction.** They gain a +3 bonus to avoid surprise in their natural habitat. They can track the scent of creatures for up to 6 miles with the equivalent of three ranks of Tracking proficiency.

Their **lightning reflexes** grant a +1 bonus to initiative. They are **naturally stealthy** when in their native habitat, and creatures encountering them suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls.

If a cheetah charges a creature and successfully hits it with both claws, it immediately **pounces** onthe creature. The cat’s subsequent bite attack automatically hits and the creature that has been pounced on must make a successful size-adjusted Paralysis saving throw or be knocked **prone**.

Cheetahs are entirely configured for sprinting speed and cannot sustain a fast pace of long distance travel. Because of their **poor endurance**, their expedition speed is halved relative to their combat speed.

###### Ecology

When cheetahs are encountered in a wilderness den, there is a 50% chance the cheetahs will be rearing cheetah cubs. Roll 1d6 for age and number: 1-2 it’s 1d2 juvenile cheetahs, 3-6 it’s 1d4 baby cheetahs. Juvenile cheetahs have AC 3, Spd 300’, HD 2, and attack with 2 claws (1d2 {S}) and a bite (1d3 {P}). Baby cheetahs have AC 2, Spd 270’, HD 1+1, and attack with 2 scratches (1 {S}) and a fierce nibble (1 {P}).

###### Spoils

A slain cheetah with exceptional attributes can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following components useful in magic research:

* heart (3/6 st, 27gp, *swift sword, teleportation*)
* tongue (2/6 st, 20gp, *call of the great cats*)

A cheetah's spotted pelt fetches 50gp and weighs 2/6 st.

Cheetahs are popular pets among the nobility, where they are used for sport hunting and companionship. They sometimes are used as arena beasts in the Auran Empire, but generally the larger cats are preferred for such shows.

###### Encounter

A secluded spot marked by a ring of tall, resilient grass and sporadic acacia trees serves as the sanctuary for a feline family consisting of a **cheetah** and her **four baby cheetah cubs**. The ground within the ring is dotted with soft patches of dry grass, where the mother has excavated shallow depressions for the cubs to rest and play.

### Cat, Leopard

Leopards are sleek ambush predators that can be found in the woodlands of Aurëpos and Danae and the savannahs of Ulruk. Leopards in warm regions have black and gold spotted coats, while those found in the snowy north have white and black spotted coats. Some leopards have pitch black fur; these are commonly called black panthers and are highly prized by the elves.

###### Combat

Leopards have **acute hearing** and **acute olfaction.** They gain a +2 bonus to avoid surprise in their natural habitat. They can track the scent of creatures for up to 4 miles with the equivalent of two ranks of Tracking proficiency.

They are **very agile** (as Acrobatics proficiency at 10+) and **superb climbers**, able to ascend sheer surfaces as if they were thieves (2+). They are also **adept at swimming** (as Swimming proficiency). Their **lightning reflexes** grant a +1 bonus to initiative. They are **naturally stealthy** when in their native habitat, and creatures encountering them suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls.

If a leopard charges a creature or leaps over it (using Acrobatics), and successfully hits it with both claws, it immediately **pounces** onthe creature. The leopard’s subsequent bite attack automatically hits and the creature that has been pounced on must make a successful size-adjusted Paralysis saving throw or be knocked **prone**.

###### Ecology

When leopards are encountered in a wilderness den, there is a 66% chance the leopards will be rearing leopards cubs. Roll 1d6 for age and number: 1-2 it’s 1d2 juvenile leopards, 3-6 it’s 1d4 baby panthers. Juvenile leopards have AC 2, Spd 150’, HD 2, and attack with 2 claws (1d2 {S}) and a bite (1d3 {P}). Baby leopards have AC 1, Spd 150’, HD 1+1, and attack with 2 scratches (1 {S}) and a fierce nibble (1 {P}).

###### Spoils

A slain leopard with exceptional attributes can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following components useful in magic research:

* heart (1 1/6 st, 70gp, *silent step, swift sword*)
* tongue (1 st, 65gp, *call of the great cats*)

A leopard's pelt fetches 35gp and weighs 5/6 st.

Leopards can be tamed and trained, but it is an uncommon practice in the Auran Empire. The elves, however, delight in training leopards, particularly black-furred specimens.

###### Encounter

Looming above the other nearby vegetation is a large, wide-trunked cypress tree, its leafy branches providing shade to the area around it. Lounging in its branches are a **leopard** and **four baby cubs**.

Lions are powerful ambush predators that dwell in prides. They are found primarily in Kemesh, Opelenea, Shebatea, and southern Krysea and Somirea, as well as Ulruk south of the Great Waste. Lions are popular attractions at the arena and many are imported throughout the Auran Empire. Some later escape or are bought as guards or hunt animals, so lions often appear well outside their native habitats.

###### Combat

Lions have **acute hearing** and **acute olfaction.** They gain a +2 bonus to avoid surprise in their natural habitat. They can track the scent of creatures for up to 4 miles with the equivalent of two ranks of Tracking proficiency.

They are **quite agile** (as Acrobatics proficiency at 12+) and **good climbers**, able to ascend sheer surfaces as if they were thieves (6+). Their **lightning reflexes** grant a +1 bonus to initiative. They are **naturally stealthy** when in their native habitat, and creatures encountering them suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls.

If a lion charges a creature or leaps over it (using Acrobatics), and successfully hits it with both claws, it immediately **pounces** onthe creature. The lion’s subsequent bite attack automatically hits and the creature that has been pounced on must make a successful size-adjusted Paralysis saving throw or be knocked **prone**.

###### Ecology

When lions are encountered in a wilderness den, the lions will be rearing 1d4 juvenile lions and 2d4 baby lions. Juvenile lions have AC 1, Spd 150’, HD 2+2, and attack with 2 claws (1d2 {S}) and a bite (1d4 {P}). Baby lions have AC 0, Spd 120’, HD 1+2, and attack with 2 scratches (1 {S}) and a bite (1d2 {P}).

###### Spoils

A slain lion with exceptional attributes can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following components useful in magic research:

* heart (3 st, 175gp, *dominate beast, remove fear, silent step, swift sword*)
* tongue (3 st, 175gp, *call of the great cats*)

A lion’s pelt fetches 50gp and weighs 1 stone.

###### Encounter

Rising from the scrubland is a thousand-year old baobab tree, 72’ tall and 33’ in diameter. Large grooves are cut into the tree’s wood, signs of territorial marking and claw sharpening. A hollow in its great trunk serves as the den of a pride of great cats, including **seven lions**, **two cubs** and **four** **baby cubs**. The cubs in the hollow are supervised by three adults; the other four lions are hunting in the vicinity, each arriving 1d6 rounds after the pride’s den is attacked.

Lions (7): Spd 150’, AC 3, HD 5, hp 35, 28, 27, 23, 23, 18, 17, #AT 3 (2 claws/bite 6+), Dmg 1d4+1 {S} /1d4+1 {S} /1d10 {P}, Save F3, ML +1, AL N, XP 350

### Cat, Lynx

Lynxes are found everywhere in Aurëpos, Danae, Ithea, and Ulruk. Those found in arid climates are often called caracals or desert lynxes, while those encountered in savanna are often called bush cats. Whatever their name, they are brown or gray spotted cats with large, tufted ears and beard-like ruffs under their chins. They measure about 4’ long and weigh about 50 – 60 lbs.

Elusive and cautious, lynxes are only rarely seen by humans or demi-humans.

###### Combat

Lynxes have **acute hearing** and **acute olfaction.** They gain a +2 bonus to avoid surprise in their natural habitat. They can track the scent of creatures for up to 4 miles with the equivalent of two ranks of Tracking proficiency.

They are **very agile** (as Acrobatics proficiency at 10+) and **good climbers**, able to ascend sheer surfaces as if they were thieves (5+). They are also **adept at swimming** (as Swimming proficiency). Because of their large padded feet, they are **surefooted on snow** and retain their full speed in Snowy conditions. Their **lightning reflexes** grant a +1 bonus to initiative. They are **naturally stealthy** when in their native habitat, and creatures encountering them suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls.

If a lynx charges a creature or leaps over it (using Acrobatics), and successfully hits it with both claws, it immediately **pounces** onthe creature. The lynx’s subsequent bite attack automatically hits and the creature that has been pounced on must make a successful size-adjusted Paralysis saving throw or be knocked **prone**.

###### Ecology

When lynxes are encountered in a wilderness den, there is a 50% chance the lynxes will be rearing lynx kittens. Roll 1d6 for age and number: 1-3 it’s 1d2 juvenile cougars, 4-6 it’s 1d4 baby cougars. Juvenile lynxes have AC 2, Spd 180’, HD 1/2, and attack with a fierce nibble (1 {P}). Baby lynxes have AC 1, Spd 180’, HD ¼, 1 hp, ML -4, and do not fight.

###### Spoils

A slain lynx with exceptional attributes can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following component:

* tongue (2/6 st, 21gp, *call of the great cats, silent step*)

A lynx's pelt fetches 16.5gp and weighs 1/6 st.

Because of their small size, lynxes can be trained by domestic animal trainers instead of wild animal trainers, provided they are caught as babies or juveniles and reared in captivity.

###### Encounter

A collapse of boulders from the higher slopes has created a talus cave on the mountain. Tracks in the snow leading to and from the cave suggest a number of pawed creatures live within. The talus cave is the den of a **lynx** and her **3 baby lynx kittens**.

### Cat, Saber-Tooth Tiger

Saber-tooth tigers are an ancient species that the most learned sages agree to be long extinct in Aurëpos. However, adventurers have reported encountering these prehistoric predators in the high mountains of Aurëpos, the untamed jungles of Ulruk and certain uncharted and remote tropical islands.

###### Combat

Saber-toothed tigers have **acute hearing** and **acute olfaction.** They gain a +2 bonus to avoid surprise in their natural habitat. They can track the scent of creatures for up to 4 miles with the equivalent of two ranks of Tracking proficiency.

They are **quite agile** (as Acrobatics proficiency at 12+) and **good climbers**, able to ascend sheer surfaces as if they were thieves (6+). They are also **adept at swimming** (as Swimming proficiency). Their **lightning reflexes** grant a +1 bonus to initiative. They are **naturally stealthy** when in their native habitat, and creatures encountering them suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls.

If a tiger charges a creature or leaps over it (using Acrobatics), and successfully hits it with both claws, it immediately **pounces** onthe creature. The tiger’s subsequent bite attack automatically hits and the creature that has been pounced on must make a successful size-adjusted Paralysis saving throw or be knocked **prone**.

###### Ecology

When saber-tooth tigers are encountered in a wilderness den, the saber-tooths will be rearing 1d2 juvenile saber-tooths and 1d4 baby saber-tooths. Juvenile saber-tooths have AC 1, Spd 120’, HD 4, and attack with 2 claws (1d3 {S}) and a bite (1d8 {P}). Baby saber-tooths have AC 0, Spd 120’, HD 2+2, and attack with 2 scratches (1 {S}) and a bite (1d3 {P}).

###### Spoils

A slain saber-tooth tiger can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following components useful in magic research:

* heart (9 1/6 st, 550gp, *silent step, swift sword,* weapon +1)
* tongue (9 1/6 st, 550gp, *call of the great cats*)

A saber-tooth tiger's pelt fetches 115gp weighs 2 1/6 st.

###### Encounter

A freshwater stream trickling through a narrow gulch flows into a talus cavern, 8’ high, 7’ wide, and some 40’ long, created by a rock fall some years ago. Creatures attempting to water at the stream, or enter the cave, are attacked by a troop of **three sabre-tooth tigers** who are rearing a **pair of juvenile sabre-tooth cubs**. The **troop leader**, ferocious even by the standards of prehistoric great cats, is ranging on the highlands above the gulch and will arrive 1d6 rounds after the den is attacked.

Sabre-tooth troop leader: Str 14, Dex 18; AC 6, Spd 180', HD 8, hp 43, #AT 3 (2 claws 2+/bite 1+), Dmg 1d8+1 {S} / 1d8+1 {S} / 2d8+2 {P}, Save F4, ML +2, XP 1100; Special: lightning reflexes, naturally stealthy, pounce

### Cat, Tiger

Tigers are the most powerful of all large cats. They roam the woodlands of Somirea, the jungles of Ulruk, and the cold northern forests of the Jutting Mountains. Most tigers avoid humans, but from time to time a beast will taste the blood of men and become a man-killer, thereafter hunting humans in preference to all other prey.

###### Combat

Tigers have **acute hearing** and **acute olfaction.** They gain a +2 bonus to avoid surprise in their natural habitat. They can track the scent of creatures for up to 4 miles with the equivalent of two ranks of Tracking proficiency.

They are **quite agile** (as Acrobatics proficiency at 12+) and **good climbers**, able to ascend sheer surfaces as if they were thieves (5+). They are also **adept at swimming** (as Swimming proficiency). Their **lightning reflexes** grant a +1 bonus to initiative. They are **naturally stealthy** when in their native habitat, and creatures encountering them suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls.

If a tiger charges a creature or leaps over it (using Acrobatics), and successfully hits it with both claws, it immediately **pounces** onthe creature. The tiger’s subsequent bite attack automatically hits and the creature that has been pounced on must make a successful size-adjusted Paralysis saving throw or be knocked **prone**.

###### Ecology

When tigers are encountered in a wilderness den, there is a 50% chance the tigers will be rearing tiger cubs. Roll 1d4 for age and number; 1-2 it’s 1d2 juvenile tigers, 3-4 it’s 1d4 baby tigers. Juvenile tigers have AC 1, Spd 120’, HD 3, and attack with 2 claws (1d2 {S}) and a bite (1d6 {P}). Baby tigers have AC 0, Spd 120’, HD 2, and attack with 2 scratches (1 {S}) and a bite (1d2 {P}).

###### Spoils

### Catoblepas

The catoblepas is a monstrosity standing about 7’ tall, measuring 9’ from snout to tail, and weighing about 4,000 lbs. The body resembles that of a musk ox with a brownish-black coat and shaggy horse-like mane. Its neck is long and thin, while its head is so large and heavy that it rarely raises it. When it does raise its head, it reveals narrow bloodshot eyes set over a large mouth filled with sharp teeth. It feeds exclusively upon poisonous shrubs and roots, a diet which makes its exhalations deadly to any creatures nearby.

###### Combat

Catoblepas have **acute olfaction** that grants them a +1 bonus to avoid surprise in their natural habitat. They use this to find the poisonous vegetation upon which they feed.

The **foul miasma** which the catoblepas exhales is extremely dangerous. Any creature that starts its initiative or moves within 5’ of a catoblepas must make a Death saving throw. If the save fails, the victim becomes **paralyzed** with painful convulsions and dies after 1 turn.

In combat, a catoblepas will bite creatures with its razor-sharp teeth for 2d6 {P!}damage. In lieu of biting, the catoblepas can direct its **murderous gaze** in a cone 60' long and 30' wide in front of itself. Each creature within the cone that is beholding the catoblepas must make a Death saving throw. If the save succeeds, the creature is not affected. If the save fails, the creature is instantly slain.

Catoblepas have tough hides that are **resistant** to mundane bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. They are **immune** to poisonous damage.

###### Ecology

The catoblepas inhabits bogs, marshes, swamps, and other fetid places where poisonous plants flourish and foul air blows. When catoblepas are encountered in a wilderness den, there is an 85% chance the adults will be rearing bleppies. Roll 1d4 for age and number; 1-2, it’s 1d3 babies, 3-4 it’s 1d2 juveniles. Juvenile catoblepas have AC 5, Spd 90’, HD 4, and attack with one bite (1d6 {P}). Baby catoblepas have AC 4, Spd 90’, HD 2+2, and attack with one nibble (1d2 {P}). Neither have murderous gazes.

###### Spoils

If a catoblepas is encountered in the wilderness, there is a 70% chance it will be grazing on a patch of poisonous herbs. Roll 1d6 to determine the patch: 1 – 3d10 doses of yew, 2 – 4d6 does of hellebore, 3 – 4d6 doses of hemlock, 4 – 3d6 does of foxglove, 5 – 2d6+1 doses of belladonna, 6 – 2d6+1 doses of henbane. Treat this as a dangerous terrain encounter (see ***ACKS II JJ*** p. XX).

A slain catoblepas can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the following components useful in magic research:

* eyes (12 st., 720gp, *extinguish life, flesh to ash*)
* liver (12 st., 720gp, *neutralize poison, purify food & water*)
* stomach (11 st., 660gp, *cause disease, poison*)

### Centaur

The origin of the race of centaurs is unknown. Though evidently a form of beastman, they appear in the earliest elven annals still known to sages. Whatever their origin, they are noble creatures with the torsos, arms, and heads of humans and the bodies and legs of horses. Most centaurs in Aurëpos have light olive skin and brown hair and hide, but like the horses and humans they were bred from they can vary wildly in build and coloration. They weigh around 2,100 lbs.

Centaurs combine the skittishness of horses and with the tribalism of humans. As a result, they are quite reclusive, preferring to live far from other races in densely woodlands.

Centaurs speak their own language, which seems to be closely related to Argollëan (Elven). Chieftains and shamans also speak Argollëan, Faerie, and 1d4 other languages.

###### Combat

Centaurs avoid conflict where possible, but the stallions will fight to guard their communities while the mares and foals escape. Centaurs attack by kicking with their two forelegs and striking with a weapon. Their **thick hides** grant a +2 AC bonus.

When armed for battle, they typically wear leather armor (for a final AC of 4) and carry oaken clubs and composite bows.

###### Ecology

Each centaur troop will be led by a chieftain in plate armor with 6 AC, 5 HD, 29 hp, and a +2 damage bonus. A chieftain has a 50% chance of possessing Shaman abilities at level 1d6. As long as the chieftain is alive, the centaurs will gain a +2 bonus to morale rolls.

Centaur lairs will have mares and foals equal to 100% and 200% of the number of stallions. Centaurs mares have AC 2, Spd 180’, HD 3, and attack with 2 hooves (1d4 {B}). Centaur foals have AC 1, HD 2, and attack with 2 hooves (1d2 {B}). Neither mares nor foals use weapons.

###### Spoils

A slain centaur stallion can be harvested with Healing for the following components useful in magic research:

* hooves (1 2/6 st., 80gp, *call of the galloping herd, safe travels, swift sword, vigor*)

A slain centaur mare can be harvested for components worth and weighing 40% less (5/6 st, 50gp).

###### Lore

*The Battle of Garupesh could have been won had the Somireans been better versed in military history. The tactics that the Argollëans used to conquer the centaur horse archers of the Istrith would have ably served against the Skysos.*

* Harbitus Kyr, *The Great Skysos War*

### Centipede, Giant

Aura’s natural historians disagree as to whether giant centipedes are magical crossbreeds or atavistic throwbacks to an era when arthropods ruled the world. Whatever their origin that these foot-long quarter-pound poisonous centipedes prefer dark, wet locations.

###### Combat

Giant centipedes have **terrestrial mechanoreception** enabling them to sense vibration in the ground over long distances equivalent to line of sight in full daylight. Spells or effects that would ordinarily cause blindness do not affect the beetle when it is using terrestrial mechanoreception. However, creatures that are flying, levitating, or otherwise not touching the ground are invisible to the sense. Terrestrial mechanoreception can penetrate structures and terrain features.

When they detect prey, giant centipedes attack with a poisonous bite that deals 1 {P} damage. Any creature damaged by the bite must make a Poison saving throw. If the save succeeds, there is no effect. If the save fails, the creature becomes **incapacitated** at the end of the centipede’s initiative. The conditions lasts for 10 days or until the poison is neutralized.

###### Ecology

When a nest of giant centipedes is encountered, there is a 12% chance per centipede that it will be incubating a clutch of 1d6 eggs. The eggs have 1 hp and weigh 1/1000 st (e.g. 1 coin). Centipede hatchlings are rarely found in nests, because the larvae immediately disperse into the wild after they emerge from their eggs.

###### Spoils

A slain giant centipede can be harvested with Animal Husbandry 2 for the following components useful in magic research:

* bundle of legs (1/6 st., 3gp, *bloody flux*)
* mandibles (1/6 st., 3gp, *slumber*)

If not used for magic research, a giant centipede’s mandibles fetch 1gp and weigh 1/6 st. Its venom (onset time of 1 turn, +2 saving modifier, target incapacitated for 1d10 turns) fetches 50gp and weighs 1/6 st.

###### Encounter

A centuries-old building, some 75’ square, perhaps the villa of some lord from antiquity, has fallen into rubble. The collapse of the walls and ceiling has shattered the flagstones in the floor, creating large pockets of debris encircled by foundation stones. Between the debris piles are pools of murky, polluted water. **15 giant centipedes** have formed a nest here. One of the centipedes is incubating **6 centipede eggs**.

Giant centipedes (15): Spd 60', AC 0, HD 1/2\*, hp 2 each, #AT 1 (bite 10+), Dmg 1 {P} + poison, Save NM, ML -1, AL N, XP 6; Special: poison bite (save v. Poison or incapacitated 1d10 days)

### Chaos Hulk

Raw chaos given physical form, a chaos hulk is a roiling, shifting, twisting mass of tissues, constantly growing and reabsorbing limbs, mouths, eyes, and other organs of all varieties, natural and alien. Feathers, scales, skin, slime, carapace, bone, all these elements and more may appear on a hulk at any single moment, only to mutate again moment later.

###### Combat

Insane and unpredictable, a chaos hulk is by turns idiot and genius. Roll 1d20 on the following table at the start of the hulk’s initiative to determine its actions:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Experiences a round of lucidity, and can briefly converse with others. |
| 2 | Cackles and sways to unheard music. |
| 3 | Stands utterly motionless and unchanging. |
| 4 | Rants gibberish in tongues known and unknown. |
| 5 | Mews piteously, twitching and drooling. |
| 6 | Savagely attacks itself for the round. |
| 7 | Attempts to devour the nearest thing, living or dead, animate or inanimate. |
| 8 | Assaults the nearest shadow or inanimate object. |
| 9 | Screams terrible howls and roars and thrashes wildly. |
| 10 | Flees in a random direction at running speed. |
| 11+ | Moves to and attacks the nearest living things madly. |

A chaos hulk can make 1d6 attacks per combat action. Each successful attack deals 1d12 {N!}damage. Each creature damaged must make a Spells saving throw and a Death saving throw for **chaos infection** at the end of the hulk’s initiative.

If the Spells save fails, the creature is **mentally infected**. At the start of its initiative, it must roll on the hulk’s action table above to determine how it acts. At the end of its initiative, it makes another Spell save; succeeds ends the condition.

If the Death save fails, the creature is **physically infected** and becomes an undulating mass of flesh, muscle, and organs, gurgling and screaming in torment. The creature becomes **helpless** unless mentally infected. At the end of its initiative, it makes another Death save; success ends the condition.

Due to their ever-changing nature, chaos hulks regenerate 1d12 hit points at the start of their initiative each round. This same shifting renders them **immune** to enchantment and transmogrification effects. As Chaotic incarnations, they are inherently evil for the purposes of spells.

###### Ecology

Chaos spawn are manifestations of raw chaos without any natural habitat. They are found only when summoned or spawned in sinkholes of evil or by wild and chaotic magic.

###### Spoils

A destroyed chaos hulk can be harvested with Alchemy 2 for the following components useful in magic research:

* iridescent ichor (60 5/6 st, 3650gp, *incite madness, inspire horror, madness of crowds*, all transmogrification effects)

### Child of Nasga

Beautiful yet alien, sensuous and wicked, the Children of Nasga are 20’ long snakes with silken black scales and androgynous human-like faces. They possess a cunning intellect and can speak both Ancient Zaharan and Ancient Thrassian. Devoted to Nasga, the Serpent, they are known to have served the most powerful cultists of that chthonic faith in ages past, or in some cases to have led Nasgan cults of their own.

###### Combat

The Children of Nasga have **bewitching beauty.** Each creature that is beholding the Child at the start of its initiative must make a Spells saving throw. If the save fails, the creature is **bewitched** for 1 turn. If the save succeeds, the creature is not betwitched and cannot be effected again by any Child’s bewitching beauty for 1 turn.

The Children of Nasga have **venomous bites** that deal 1d4 {P!}damage. Any creature damaged by a Child’s bite must make a Death saving throw. If the save fails, the creature dies of poison 1d4+2 turns later. In addition, when a Child successfully bites a creature, it also constricts the creature for 2d8 {B!}damage and **restrains** it. If the Child misses its bite, it can separately attack by constriction. Once it has restrained a creature, the Child can automatically deal 2d8 [B!] damage on its initiative each round to the restrained creature without having to make an attack throw. Doing so counts as the Child’s constriction attack.

As a full-round action, a Child of Nasga can perform a sinuous and seductive **hypnotic dance.** Once begun, the dance continues until the start of the Child’s next initiative or until it is slain.Each creature that beholds the dance must make a Spells saving throw at the start of its initiative. Creatures bewitched by the Child save at a -4 penalty. If the save fails, the creature becomes **mesmerized** for 2d6 rounds. If the save succeeds, there is no effect. The Child cannot perform a hypnotic dance while restraining a creature.

Like other Chaotic incarnations, Children of Nasga can be detected with *discern evil*, held at bay by *holy circle,* destroyed with *dispel evil*,and rebuked as infernals.

###### Ecology

With the fall of the Zaharan Empire, most of the Children of Nasga were bound into great etched copper bowls sealed with magical runes and wax, there to await in slumber until the Awakening, when the Chthonic gods will call them forth to fulfill their dark purposes again. As such, they are only rarely encountered outside ancient temples and tombs.

###### Spoils

A slain child of Nasga can be harvested with Alchemy 2 for the following components useful in magic research:

* golden eyes (11 4/6 st., 700gp, *bewitch monster, hypnotic sigil*)

If not used for magic research, a child of Nasga’s fangs fetch 4gp and weigh 1/6 st. Its venom (onset time 1d10 turns, +2 saving modifier, target suffers 4d4 {Po} damage on a failed Death saving throw) fetches 200gp and weighs 1/6 st.

### Chimera

The chimera is a magical hybrid of lion, goat, and red dragon. It has a head of each of these creature types, including the wings of a dragon, the front portion of the body from a lion, and the rear portion from a goat. A typical chimera measures 15’ long and weighs 4,000 lbs, with wings that span about 30’ A chimera’s dragon head is sapient and can speak Draconic.

###### Combat

Chimera have **acute olfaction** and gain a +1 bonus to avoid surprise in its natural habitat.

In combat, the chimera can rake foes with its front claws and attack with all three of its heads: the lion head attacks with a bite, the goat head gores with its horns, and the dragon head can either bite or use its **fire breath**.

The fire breath forms a cone 60' long and 30' wide at its terminal end. Each creature within the cone must make a Blast saving throw. If the save fails, the creature suffers 3d6 {F!}damage. If the save succeeds, the creature suffers half that damage.

The chimera’s dragon head can only breathe fire 3 times per day; it will use either a bite or the breath weapon 50% of the time, until the breath weapon runs out and it can only bite.

###### Ecology

Chimera usually dwell in the wilderness, favoring hilly terrain far from human settlements. From time to time, however, some chimera are drawn by an atavistic draconic instinct to take up residence in volcanic caves or dungeons.

When chimera are encountered in a wilderness den, the adults have a 25% chance to be incubating 1d4 eggs. The eggs have 1 hp and weigh 4 st. Chimera spawn are rarely found in dens, because the spawn immediately disperse into the wild after they emerge from their eggs.

###### Spoils

A slain chimera can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the following components useful in magic research:

* dragon wingtips (6 4/6 st, 400gp, *fan of flames, fireball, flight, winged flight*)
* lion claws (5 st, 300gp, *swift strike*)
* lion mane (5 st, 300gp, *dominate humanoid, dominate monster, remove fear, strength of mind*)
* goat horns (5 st, 300gp, *transform other*)

A chimera's two horns each fetch 1d12x10gp and weigh 1 st per 80gp. A chimera's pelt fetches 350gp and weighs 3 1/6 st.

### Crab, Giant

These giant cousins to ordinary crabs are about 12’ in diameter and weigh up to 500 lbs. They can be found in any watery environment, but because they do not have to remain fully submerged they can also be found prowling along fresh or saltwater shores, marshes, and watery subterranean caves. Giant crabs are unintelligent, and exist merely to eat and reproduce.

###### Combat

Because they often dwell in lightless caverns or dark depths, giant crabs rely on **aquatic** **mechanoreception** (60’ range). Spells or effects that would ordinarily cause blindness do not affect crab using mechanoreception. However, creatures that are not in the water are invisible to their mechanoreception. Aquatic mechanoreception does not penetrate structures or terrain features.

When they detect prey, giant crabs attack with their powerful pincers, which deal 2d6 {P}damage each. If a giant crab successfully attacks the same target with both pincers in the same attack routine, it immediately **rends** the creature for another 2d6 {Se}damage.

Giant crabs possess the equivalent of Combat Trickery (wrestling). When attacking fast-moving prey, giant crabs will often use one pincer topin a target with a Wrestling special maneuver, then use the other pincer to tear them apart.

###### Ecology

When a colony of giant crabs is encountered, there is a 20% chance per crab that it will be incubating a clutch of 2d6 eggs. The eggs have 1 hp and weigh 3/6 st. Crab hatchlings are rarely found in colonies, because the hatchlings immediately disperse into the waters after they emerge from their eggs.

###### Spoils

A slain giant crab can be harvested with Animal Husbandry 2 for the following component:

* carapace fragment (5/6 st, 50gp, armor +2)

If not used for magic research, a giant crab's armored carapace fetches 50gp and weighs 1 2/6 st.

###### Encounter

A limestone cave mouth gapes some 11’ wide and 3’ high in the cliffs near the water’s edge. The cave’s mouth open into a grotto 21’ in diameter. About half the grotto is submerged by a murky pool; the rest is cluttered by large, algae-covered boulders. A steady drip from stalactites that loom above echoes through the cave. Hiding behind several rocks and partially submerged in the pools are **five giant crabs**. One of the crabs is incubating a clutch of **8 crab eggs**.

### Crocodile, Common

Crocodiles are carnivorous reptiles that lurk in lake, rivers, swamps, and other shallow waters. While they breathe air, they spend most of their time submerged waiting for prey to come within reach. Crocodiles of the ordinary variety are found throughout southern Aurëpos and Ulruk. They are about 12’ long and weigh about 500 lbs.

###### Combat

Common crocodiles have **acute olfaction** and gain a +1 bonus to avoid surprise in its natural habitat. They are **naturally stealthy** when submerged, and creatures encountering them suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls.

###### Ecology

When common crocodiles are encountered in the wilderness, there is a 12% chance per crocodile that it will have 5d10 eggs buried nearby. Crocodile eggs have 1 hp and weigh 1/30 st.

###### Spoils

A slain crocodile with exceptional attributes can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following component:

* skull (2/6 st, 20gp, *swimming,* armor +1)

Crocodiles are both dull-witted and ill-tempered, making them difficult to train, though the smaller specimens are somewhat easier to work with.

###### Lore

*During our stay in Istakahr, the Hierophylax, Ashenmut , gave us a tour of the Royal Antiquarium, within which are kept some of the most ancient artifacts and antiquities in the world.*

*The south wing of the first floor of the Antiquarium ends in a colonnaded gallery known as the Zoaracade, and contains the petrified bones and preserved remains of animals and monstrosities collected from across Ithea, Ulruk, and Aurëpos.*

*Among this collection were the perfectly petrified bones of a crocodile, which Ashenmut said were tens of thousands of years older than any existing civilization in the world. When I asked the Hierophylax what evidence he had for such an outlandish claim, he guided me a number of broken clay tablets with indecipherable writing and strange pictographs of fantastical lizards.*

*These tablets, he explained, had been captured by the Zaharans when they overthrew the Thrassians, and they proved that that long before the Day Without Night, the world was dominated by reptile titans that strode across the continents like colossi. What we call the crocodile was the smallest and weakest of these prehistoric monstrosities.*

### Crocodile, Giant

The giant crocodile is a prehistoric monstrosities about 40’ long and weigh about 9 tons. They haunt the swamps and rivers of the Ivory Kingdoms, where they spend most of their time submerged waiting for prey to come within reach.

###### Combat

Large crocodiles have **acute olfaction** and gain a +1 bonus to avoid surprise in its natural habitat. They are **naturally stealthy** when submerged, and creatures encountering them suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls.

###### Ecology

When giant crocodiles are encountered in the wilderness, there is a 12% chance per crocodile that it will have 5d10 eggs buried nearby. Giant crocodile eggs have 1 hp and weigh 3/6 st.

###### Spoils

A slain giant crocodile can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following component:

* skull (30 st, 1,800gp, *dismember, swimming,* armor +3, weapon +3)

A giant crocodile's armored hide fetches 800gp and weighs 47 stone.

Like their smaller siblings, giant crocodiles are both dull-witted and ill-tempered, making them difficult to train.

###### Lore

*5th Juselen 381. The* Triton’s Wake *has docked at Modishu, trading port on the east coast of Ulruk. The quartermaster and I disembarked to assess arbitrage opportunities.*

*6th Juselen 381. The quartermaster has persuaded me that the trade in exotic animals represents the best opportunity for profit. We have meetings with the Guild of Beastmongers tomorrow morning.*

*7th Juselen 381. At a cost of 2,440gp we have secured a remarkable specimen of crocodile from the Beastmongers’ Guild. The monstrosity measures 39’ from nose to tail and weighs almost 1,800 stone. The sailors have named it “Skara”.*

### Crocodile, Large

Crocodiles are carnivorous reptiles that lurk in lake, rivers, swamps, and other shallow waters. While they breathe air, they spend most of their time submerged waiting for prey to come within reach. Large crocodiles are about 20’ long and weigh 2,200 lbs. They are native to the Garupesh River in Somirea and the Kem River in Kemesh.

###### Combat

Large crocodiles have **acute olfaction** and gain a +1 bonus to avoid surprise in its natural habitat. They are **naturally stealthy** when submerged, and creatures encountering them suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls.

###### Ecology

When large crocodiles are encountered in the wilderness, there is a 12% chance per crocodile that it will have 5d10 eggs buried nearby. Large crocodile eggs have 1 hp and weigh 2/6 st.

###### Spoils

A slain large crocodile with exceptional attributes can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following component:

* skull (5 2/6 st, 320gp, *swimming,* armor +2, weapon +2)

A large crocodile's armored hide fetches 150gp and weighs 8 4/6 st.

Large crocodiles are almost as dull-witted and ill-tempered as giant crocodiles, and few are ever tamed and trained.

###### Lore

*Our expedition first encountered one of these beasts during a cruise by pleasure barge from Zhapur to Istakahr. One of our hired guards, Khanu, having drunk too much wine, became overbold, and announced that he would demonstrate his athletic prowess by swimming from the west bank of the Kem to the east. Before our hosts could stop him, the reckless fool had stripped off his tunic and dived into the water.*

*I ran to the bulwark just in time to see Khanu surface, laughing as he paddled towards a log floating nearby. A moment later, his laughter turned to screams, and the waters darkened with crimson. For what a moment before had seemed a log was in truth a submerged crocodile. How well it hid! How swiftly it struck!*

*Were I not certain it was a natural animal, I would find it easy to believe that the Kem crocodile was actually a crossbred monstrosity created by Zaharan alchemy.*

* Toraster the Elder, *Bestiary of Aurëpos*

### Cyclops

Cyclopes stand 20’ tall and weigh 5,800 lbs. Each bears just one large eye centered above its nose. Close relatives to the true giants, their origins are unknown to even the wisest sages. According to adventurers who have encountered them, cyclopes are somewhat childlike, having both the cruelty and credulous of pubescent boys. They often keep flocks of sheep and sometimes cultivate grapes, dwelling in nearby caves that overlook their flocks and vineyards.

Cyclops speak the bombastic, booming language of giants. They can also speak simple words and phrases in Common.

###### Combat

In combat, cyclopes can smash with their fists or with weapons. When smashing with piercing or slashing weapons, cyclopes deliver **vicious blows** that deal an additional 4 points per smash. When smashing with bludgeoning weapons, cyclopes can **topple and fling** man-sized or smaller creatures with every attack. A small or man-sized creature struck by a cyclops’s smash must make a size-adjusted Paralysis saving throw or be knocked prone and forced back a number of feet equal to the damage dealt. If this would push the creature into a wall or obstacle, the creature takes 1d6 points of damage per 10’ he has traveled. If the creature is pushed into another character or monster, he is halted. If the character or monster he is pushed into is smaller, the character/monster is instead knocked down, and the opponent continues to be forced back. A cyclops can cleave after a successful smash that forces back its target.

Instead of smashing, cyclops can **hurl boulders** to a distance of 900’, dealing 3d6 bludgeoning damage in a 5’ radius to the impact point. When hurling a boulder, a giant functions like a heavy ballista using the rules for Missile Attacks with Artillery (***ACKS II RR****,* p. XX). However, because they have reduced depth perception, they suffer a -2 penalty to the attack throw. The cyclops has no minimum range and does not need to reload, so it can throw a boulder each round it has sufficient ammunition.

A cyclops has a 10% chance to have the ability to *bestow curse* as a spell-like ability once per week.

###### Ecology

Cyclops are loners, and live together in small numbers only on occasion. When 2 or more cyclops are encountered in a lair, they have a 25% chance to be a family. (If not, they are just a bachelor gang.) A cyclopes family consists of 2 adults and up to one juvenile and one baby cyclops. Juvenile cyclops have AC 2, Spd 60’, HD 6+2, and attack with 1 smash (1d10 {B}). Baby cyclops have AC 1, Spd 60’, HD 4+1, and attack with 1 smash (1d4 {B}).

###### Spoils

A slain cyclops can be harvested with Healing for the following component:

* eye (23 2/6 st, 1,400gp, *bestow curse, clairvoyance, scry,* armor +1, weapon +3*)*

If a cyclops family is encountered, up to 50% of the value can be in livestock or wine. Bachelor gangs have ordinary treasure.

### Dakhanavar, Greater

Dakhanavars are often confused with vampires, but the creatures are distinct. The mother of monsters, Iskara, bred the dakhanavar by infusing cacodemon ichor into the bodies of giant blood-drinking bats. Greater dakhanavars were formed with the ichor of more powerful cacodemons. They resemble bats of extraordinary size with wingspans of 50’ and weights of 500 lbs. They have huge fanged mouths and great fingered wings barbed at each joint’s end with iron claws.

Dakhanavars are as intelligent as mortal men. They can speak Ancient Zaharan, Classical Auran, Common, Elvish, and the dialect of any local beastmen. They dwell in forbidding ruins, dark forests, and bleak cliffs.

###### Combat

A greater dakhanavar **is dreadful** to confront.A creature which starts its initiative, or moves within, 60’ of a greater dakhanavar must make a Paralysis saving throw. If the save succeeds, the creature gains immunity to the effects of every dakhanavar’s dreadfulness for 1 turn. If the save fails, the creature starts **faltering.** If the creature was already faltering, it becomes **frightened** instead. The faltering or frightened condition ends if removed magically or if the greater dakhanavar is destroyed or no longer within 60’.

A greater dakhanavar can **shapechange** as a movement action into or from the form of a beautiful elf. In elf form it can fight with weapons, making one attack per round and dealing double the ordinary damage dice with each blow due to its preternatural strength. It retains its spellcasting abilities and immunities, but is not dreadful to confront unless it wishes it.

If a greater dakhanavar damages a target with its bite, the dakhanavar latches onto it and begins **draining blood**.Once latched on, the dakhanavar can use its combat action to automatically deal 2d6 {N!} damage to the creature each round. Creatures that are having their blood drained by a dakhanavar can still move, but count as carrying extra encumbrance equal to its weight. The dakhanavar moves with the creature from which it is drinking blood. However, if the creature is light enough, the dakhanavar can fly off with it on its movement action.

Due to their spiritual nature, greater dakhanavars also possess the **spellcasting abilities** of 6th level mages. They are **immune** to mundane bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.

###### Ecology

When a greater dakhanavar is encountered in its roost, it has a 35% chance of ruling over a nest of lesser dakhanavar and their accompanying bats and bat swarms. See the entry for lesser dakhanavar for more information on their habitat, including breeding habits.

###### Spoils

A slain greater dakhanavar can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the following components useful in magic research:

### Dakhanavar, Lesser

Dakhanavars are often confused with vampires, but the creatures are distinct. The mother of monsters, Iskara, bred the dakhanavar by infusing cacodemon ichor into the bodies of giant blood-drinking bats. Lesser dakhanavars were formed with the ichor of less powerful cacodemons than their greater kin. They resemble bats of great size with wingspans of 40’ and weights of 350 lbs. They have huge fanged mouths and great fingered wings barbed at each joint’s end with iron claws.

Dakhanavars are as intelligent as mortal men. They can speak Ancient Zaharan, Classical Auran, Common, Elvish, and the dialect of any local beastmen. They dwell in forbidding ruins, dark forests, and bleak cliffs.

###### Combat

If a lesser dakhanavar damages a target with its bite, the dakhanavar latches onto it and begins **draining blood**.Once latched on, the dakhanavar can use its combat action to automatically deal 2d6 {N!} damage to the creature each round. Creatures that are having their blood drained by a dakhanavar can still move, but count as carrying an extra 50 st. of encumbrance equal to its weight. The dakhanavar moves with the creature from which it is drinking blood.

###### Ecology

When lesser dakhanavar are encountered in their roost, there is a 35% chance the dakhanavar will be accompanied by 2d10 giant vampire bats and 4d10 bat swarms.

Dakhanavar are interfertile with other dakhanavar as well as with giant vampire bats. If both parents are greater dakhanavar, the offspring will be too. If one parent is greater and one parent is lesser, the offspring will be a lesser dakhanavar. In all other cases, the offspring will be a giant vampire bat. Dakhanavar of the male sex tend to copulate freely with any available partner, but those of the female sex will only mate with another dakhanavar of equal or greater status, never with bats. Offspring are carried by the mother until they reach juvenile age and become capable of flying.

Whenever dakhanavar are encountered, each dakhanavar has a 15% chance of carrying a recently-born pup. Lesser dakhanavar pups have 3 AC, 15’ Spd, and 2 HD, while greater dakhanavar pups have 4 AC, 15’ Spd, and 2+3 HD. Neither can fly and both can attack with two scritches (1 slashing damage) and a nibble (1 piercing damage).

###### Spoils

A slain lesser dakhanavar can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the following components useful in magic research:

* ears (3 st, 180gp, *inaudibility, noiselessness*)
* fangs (3 st, 180gp, *bloody flux, life transfer*)

### Death Charger

Death chargers are undead cavalry created by necromantically bonding and stitching the upper body of a zombie-like humanoid to the back of a re-animated warhorse. In effect, this creates a fearless, unquestioning cavalryman who cannot be forcibly dismounted and acts in silent unison with his mount. Even though slowed by zombification, death chargers can manage as much speed as a heavier warhorse and never need food or rest.

Like skeletons and zombies, death chargers have only the dimmest flicker of sapience. Any instructions given to a death charger by its creator or controller must be very simple. In the absence of orders or opponents, death chargers stand still as death.

###### Combat

Unless under another’s control, death chargers are automatically Hostile to any living creature they encounter. They will always charge if possible.

Death chargers can attack twice with their hooves and once with their melee weapon. They are generally equipped with shield, sword, and lance (with which they deal double damage on a charge). Some death chargers might be further protected by armor. A death charger wearing armor adds the AC bonus to its base AC of 4.

Like all undead, death chargers are immune to enchantment effects, necrotic damage, and poisonous damage. They are inherently evil for purposes of *discern evil*and *holy circle*spells. Death chargers are rebuked as wraiths.

###### Ecology

As undead constructs, death chargers have no natural habitat. They are usually found serving powerful necromancers or lingering in the abandoned ruins of ancient and evil civilizations.

###### Spoils

A destroyed death charger can be harvested with Healing 2 for the following components useful in magic research:

* human skull (4/6 st, 45gp, *deathless minion, unliving puppet*)
* human humerus (4/6 st, 40gp, *striking*)
* hooves (4/6 st, 40gp, *vigor*)

###### Encounter

The burned-out remains of an Auran fort lay like a black scar atop a nearby hill. The wooden stockade that once encircled the fort is charred and broken along half its length, and reduced to ash along the remainder. Past the stockade are a number of blackened husks, scorched frames and burned foundations, all neatly arranged in the customary pattern of an Imperial fort. Only one structure remains intact: a cavalry stable-barracks, 200’ long and 50’ wide, made of whitewashed limestone, with a 15’ high red-tiled roof. At one time the stable-barracks garrisoned sixty men and horses, but now it is occupied by **eight death chargers**. The death chargers were created from the burned corpses of soldiers and mounts that died in the fire, and are truly hideous to behold.

### Death Knight

For centuries, the Zaharans interred their mummified lords in peaceful *torpor* to await the Awakening. In the closing days of the Empyrean War, it became clear that this stately tradition was under terrible threat. When great Suhgurim, prince of ruinguards, was felled at the fields of Morgot by his half-brother Valerian, even the sorcerer-king Sebek was forced to admit that defeat was at hand. Violating a millennium of tradition, Sebek ordered that Suhgurim and his other fallen ruinguards be raised as fearsome undead of a type never created before or since: death knights. To be made a death knight was to be doomed to an eternity of suffering. Bound forever into irremovable plate armor, denied all the pleasures of life, the death knights were also forbidden the peace of *torpor*. Instead, they were sent straight back onto the battlefields, undead juggernauts whose hatred for their own horrific existence was matched only by their enmity for the Empyrean crusaders who had destroyed their birthright.

The *Fourth Book of the Empyrean War,* part of the *Seven Radiant Scrolls,* claims that all of the death knights were destroyed when Zahar was sacked. But the realm of Zahar was vast and its necromancy mighty …

###### Combat

All death knights have a **horrific** **visage**. When a creature first beholds one or more undead with this power, and at the start of each round thereafter that it continues to do so, the creature must make a Paralysis saving throw. The save suffers a -1 penalty per additional horrifying undead after the first. If the save fails, the creature is **cowering** until the start of the next round. If the save succeeds, the creature gains immunity to the effects of every undead’s horrific visage for 1 turn.

Every death knight was once a 12th level Zaharan Ruinguard. It possess all the class powers and proficiencies it had in life. However, these powers are magnified by its undead status. Anytime a death knight uses its **arcane striking** power, all of the damage dealt by the arcane strike becomes **enervating**, such that it permanently reduces the target’s maximum hp by the amount of damage dealt.

If the creature’s hp are reduced to 0, the creature is slain. If not slain, the creature becomes **enervated**.If a creature is slain by the enervating touch or enervated condition, it cannot be restored to life save by ritual magic*.* One day after the creature dies, it manifests as a **haunt** somewhere within 300’ of where it died (see p. XX).

The death knight’s irremovable armor grants it a 15 AC and makes it **immune** to enchantment effects, to necrotic and poisonous damage, and to all mundane damage. It is **resistant** to extraordinary bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. As undead, death knights are inherently evil for purposes of *discern evil*and *holy circle*spells. They are rebuked as vampires, but can make a Spells saving throw to resist the effects.

###### Ecology

Death knight are typically served by lesser undead, including 1d12 skeletal slayers and either 4d6 zombies or 3d10 skeletons.

###### Spoils

A destroyed death knight can be harvested with Healing 2 for the following components useful in magic research:

* runic cuirass (47 3/6 st, 2,850gp, *arcane armor*, *divine armor*, *divine protection*, *physical invulnerability* (all), *energy invulnerability* (all), armor +4)
* skull (47 3/6 st, 2,850gp, *cone of fear*, *frighten humanoid, inspire horror, panic*)

### Devil Boar

The devil boar is a shapeshifting monster capable of transforming between the form of a grotesquely fat human and an immense boar. Though sometimes mistaken for lycanthropic wereboars, devil boars are far more malicious. They delight in the taste of human flesh, and always take residence in or near areas occupied by man so they can easily have people for dinner. They speak the language of the local population, and do not have their own tongue.

###### Combat

In their human form, devil boars possess a **hypnotic gaze.** A devil boar can use its combat action to hypnotize a humanoid creature within 60’ which is beholding the devil boar. When targeted, the creature must make a Spells saving throw at -2. If the save succeeds, the creature is not affected. If the save fails, the creature is **enslaved** until either the devil boar releases the creature from its control, the devil boar is destroyed, or the effect is dispelled. The devil boar can release an enslaved creature from its control at any time without expending an action. A devil boar can maintain control over no more than one enslaved creatures per HD.

In their boar form, devil boars have the **acute hearing** and **acute olfaction** of giant boars. They gain a +2 bonus to avoid surprise and can track the scent of creatures for up to 6 miles with the equivalent of three ranks of Tracking.

Devil boars in either form are immune to all mundane damage. However, damage dealt to devil boars by silver weapons is considered to be extraordinary damage.

###### Ecology

When devil boars are encountered in their lair, each devil boar has a 75% chance of having 1d3 **enslaved** thralls. Thralls should be rolled up as NPCs using the rules in the ***ACKS II JJ*** (p. XX).

While a devil boar can reproduce naturally, producing piglets that mature over many years, most do not typically do so. More often, a devil boar creates more of its kind by feeding a human or demi-human the flesh of his or her spouse, parents, and/or children. Some depraved cultists voluntarily undergo this ritual, but more often the devil boars transform unwitting or unwilling victims. The victim can make a Death saving throw to resist the transformation. If the save fails, the newborn devil boar becomes an obligate cannibal, growing increasingly corpulent with every meal (1 st per day) until he reaches 90 st and becomes a devil boar. The transformation can be halted before completion but only by a *remove curse* cast by a 9th level or higher caster. Once the transformation has occurred, only ritual magic can reverse it.

###### Spoils

A slain devil boar can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the following components useful in magic research:

* blood (11 4/6 st, 700gp, *curse of swine, skinchange*)
* skin (10 st, 600gp, *deflect ordinary weapons, physical resistance*)
* tongue (11 4/6 st, 700gp, *bewitch humanoid, dominate humanoid, enslave humanoid*)

### Devil Ray, Giant

The giant devil ray is an enormous sea ray with wings that span around 15’ and a body that weighs up to 3,500 lbs. Their name derives from their cephalic fins, which resemble two horn-like structures in their heads, which lend the creature a sinister aspect. The ray’s long spiny tail, which ends in a venomous stinger, furthers the impression of devilishness. However, despite their appearance, giant devil rays are peaceful, curious creatures that are considerably smarter than most fish.

###### Combat

Humans and demi-humans swimming in water gain a +1 reaction roll bonus whenever they encounter these inquisitive creatures.

Rays are peaceful and deter predation by their size and speed. If forced to fight they attack with their **venomous sting**. Any creature damaged by a devil ray’s sting must make a Death save. If the save fails, the creature suffers 1d6 {Po}damage and becomes **queasy** from pain and nausea for 8 hours or until the poison is neutralized.

Giant devil rays have **natural camouflage** that make them hard to spot. Creatures encountering them suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls.

They are **prodigious leapers**; a devil ray that charges on its initiative can jump up to 15’ vertically and horizontally out of the water at any point in its movement.

###### Ecology

Since rays do not make nests, the lair roll actually determines whether the ray swims alone or in a fever of other rays.

Lifespan 26 years

###### Spoils

A slain giant devil ray can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following component useful in magic research:

* cephalic fins (2 st., 120gp, *leaping, swimming*)
* spiny tail (3 1/6 st., 200gp, *cause injury, neutralize poison, poison*)

Giant rays are smart and friendly enough to be tamed and trained. Such a practice is not common among the humans and demi-humans of the Ammas Aurë, but adventurers who have delved its deep waters claim that some tritons use rays as aquatic mounts.

### Dog, Hunting

Hunting dogs are fast, lean hounds trained to track and bring down prey by working in packs. The breeds are differentiated by whether they hunt by scent or sight. Both breeds are kept by humans and demi-humans throughout Aurëpos, and many feral or wild dogs of similar build are found throughout the countryside.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Region of Aurëpos | Hunting Dog Breed |
| Auran Empire | Red Bloodhound (scent) |
| Dwarves | Underterrier (scent) |
| Elves | Argollëan Windhound (sight) |
| Jutland | Jutting Mountain Cur (scent) |
| Rorn | Rornish Staghound (sight) |
| Sunset Kingdoms | Pharoah Hound (sight) |

###### Combat

Hunting dogs have **acute hearing** and **acute olfaction.** They gain a +2 bonus to avoid surprise in their natural habitat.

Scent hounds can track the scent of creatures for up to 6 miles with the equivalent of three ranks of Tracking proficiency. Sight hounds cannot track, but they are faster than scent hounds, with a speed of 80’/240’.

###### Ecology

When hunting dogs are encountered in their den, the adults will be rearing 1d6 juvenile dogs and 1d3-1 baby dogs. Juvenile dogs have AC 0, Spd 150’, HD 1/2, and attack with a bite (1d2 {P!}). Baby dogs have AC -1, Spd 150’, 1 hp, ML -4, and fight only with adorable nibbles that melt the heart but deal no damage.

###### Spoils

A slain hunting dog with extraordinary attributes can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following component:

* heart (2/6 st, 15gp, *faithful companion, locate animal or pant, locate object*)

Affable, intelligent, and pack-oriented, hunting dogs are exceptionally easy to train.

###### Encounter

A small farmhouse stands in a clearing just ahead, a compact field to one side. The field is overgrown with weeds and littered with dog manure. The house itself appears neglected, and a hound-sized hole has been chewed into the bottom of the back door. A pack of **11 hunting dogs** have made the house their den, the family who owned the house having long since fled. The dogs are starving and feral, but a character with the Animal Training (dogs) or Beast Friendship proficiency can gain their trust with a Friendly reaction roll. In one of the bedrooms, a litter of **five pups** plays with their mother.

Hunting dogs (11): Spd 180’, AC 2, HD 1+1, hp 6 each, #AT 1 (bite 9+), Dmg 1d4 {P}, Save F1, ML 0, AL N, XP 15

Pups (5): Spd 150’, AC 0, HD ½, hp 2 each, #AT 1 (bite), Dmg 1d2 {P}, Save F0, ML 0, AL N, XP 5

### Dog, War

War dogs are heavy, fierce mastiffs trained to kill on command. While dangerous, they are capable of great loyalty to their masters when properly trained. When used in battle, war dogs are usually equipped with spiked scale barding, which increases AC to 5 and damage to 1d6+1. Feral or wild war dogs are as dangerous as wolves and a large pack can threaten humans.

###### Combat

War dogs have **acute hearing** and **acute olfaction.** They gain a +2 bonus to avoid surprise in their natural habitat. They can track the scent of creatures for up to 2 miles with the equivalent of one rank of Tracking proficiency.

###### Ecology

When war dogs are encountered in their den, the adults will be rearing 1d6 juvenile dogs and 1d3 baby dogs. Juvenile dogs have AC 1, Spd 120’, HD 1+1, and attack with a bite (1d2 {P}). Baby dogs have AC 0, Spd 120’, HD 1-1, and attack with a fierce nibble (1 {P}).

###### Spoils

A slain war dog with extraordinary attributes can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following component:

* heart (3/6 st, 35gp, *discern evil, faithful companion*)

War dogs can be readily tamed and trained as guards, and they are widely used throughout Aurëpos.

###### Encounter

A wrecked wagon rests here, its frame haphazardly tilted to one side, where its wooden wheels have sheared off. A set of three tent-sized iron cages have tumbled out of the wagon and bounced open on the ground adjacent. The cages are splattered with blood from a nearby man’s body, now gnawed to the point of unrecognizability. The **three war dogs** that were being transported in the cage now make their den in the cool shade below the wagon body. All of the dogs have scars on the haunches, evidencing brutal treatment, and they will growl loudly at any approaching characters. The war dogs were tamed and trained as guard animals, and a character with Animal Training (dogs) might be able to safely handle them on a successful reaction roll (see p. XX). Due to their brutal treatment, however, a -4 penalty applies to their reactions.

**War dogs (3):** Spd 150’,AC 3, HD 2+2, hp 19, 12, 10, #AT 1 (bite 8+), dmg 1d6 {P}, Save F1, ML +2, AL N, XP 35

### Doppelgänger

Created by the long-dead and virtually forgotten Khepri before the Day Without Night, doppelgängers are shapeshifting assassins and spies bred to secretly observe and report on the Khepri’s subjugated human and demi-human slaves. Millennia have passed since those dark times, but doppelgängers still live out the purpose bred into their kind, stealing the identities of people best positioned to observe the activities and conversations of influential humans and demi-humans. They act without pity or remorse, murdering the people whose identities they steal to minimize the chances that their ruses will be discovered and even slaying anyone who becomes suspicious of the stolen identity and begins asking too many questions. Unless discovered, the shifty creatures will continue to steal more and more identities, creating a never-ending chain of death and deception.

In their rarely-seen natural form, doppelgängers resemble 5’6” tall sickly humanoids with pale hairless flesh, large bulging yellow eyes with slitted pupils, and horrifying disproportionate mouths filled with far too many teeth.

Consummate impersonators, each can speak 2d6 languages with native fluency. One language is always Khepri.

###### Combat

Doppelgängers can **adjust self**at will as a spell-like ability. The effect is identical to that of the spell, except they can remain in their adjusted forms indefinitely. Their transformations are so horrific to behold that creatures witnessing one must make Paralysis saving throws. If the save fails, the creature is **surprised** until the start of his next initiative. If the save succeeds, the creature can act normally.

A transformed doppelgänger does not radiate under *discern magic, though* its true form will be apparent to creatures with *true seeing*. They will automatically revert to their natural forms when slain. Regardless of their current form, doppelgangers are **immune** to enchantment effects and poisonous damage.

###### Ecology

Doppelgängers are androgynous, and reproduce by breeding with any other humanoid species. When doppelgängers are encountered in their lair, there is a 10% chance they will be caring for 1d3 children of the local human or demi-human kind. Only a thorough examination by a character with 3 ranks of Healing will reveal the children to be anything but normal specimens of their race. However, when they enter puberty, the children will awaken to their true nature, acquiring the form, abilities, and instincts of doppelgängers.

###### Spoils

A slain doppelgänger can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the following components useful in magic research:

### Dolphin, Common

Common dolphins are small cetaceans that often reach a length of 8’ and weight of 350 lbs. They are found throughout the warmer seas and oceans of Cybele, include the Ammas Aurë, the Narrow Sea, and the Tehonaurë coast of Ulruk.

Among the most intelligent animals in the known world, dolphins are playful, curious creatures that have been known to aid drowning divers and cooperate with fishermen to drive fish into nets. They communicate through whistles with a complexity approaching true language.

###### Combat

Humans and demi-humans swimming in water gain a +2 reaction roll bonus when encountering dolphins. Mariners universally consider the sight of dolphins to be a **good omen** on a voyage, and with good reason. If a vessel encounters a pod of dolphins, all mariners and marines on board gain a +1 bonus to saving throws and swimming throws until the next day. (If the dolphins are called by magic, however, they do not grant the bonus – you can’t fake a good omen!)

Dolphins have **acute hearing** and gain +2 bonus to avoid surprise in their natural habitat. They also use **aquatic mechanoreception** to “see” in water up to 600’. Spells or effects that would ordinarily cause blindness do not affect the dolphin while it is using aquatic mechanoreception. However, creatures that are not in the water are invisible to them. Aquatic mechanoreception does not penetrate structures or terrain features.

When forced to fight, dolphins prefer to start combat by **charging** into the enemy, dealing double damage dice (2d8) from their ram attack if successful. Subsequently the dolphin might bite its foe or use its Acrobatics proficiency to move past the opponent to line up another ram.

They are **exceptionally agile** (as Acrobatics 7+) in the water, and often outmaneuver predators such as sharks. They are also **prodigious leapers**; a dolphin that charges on its initiative can jump up to 20’ vertically and horizontally out of the water at any point in its movement. While often done just for play, dolphins in combat can leap over small vessels or even ram creatures on board.

Dolphins depend on their pod members for security against sharks and other threats, and can become nervous If encountered in or reduced to a pod of 5 or fewer, their morale score is reduced by 1.

###### Ecology

When a pod of dolphins is encountered, there is a 50% chance the adults will be accompanied by 2d6 juveniles and 2d6 babies. Juvenile dolphins have AC 3, Spd 210’, HD 1, and attack with 1 bite (1d3 {P}). Baby dolphins have AC 2, Spd 180’, HD 1/2, and attack with 1 bite (1 {P}).

###### Spoils

A slain dolphin with extraordinary characteristics can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following component useful in magic research:

### Dragon

Dragons are an ancient and dangerous reptilian species, capable of surviving for thousands of years, growing in size and power with each passing century. Throughout Aurëpos, they are held in awe and terror as living embodiments of avarice, gluttony, and wrath.

Dragons come in an astounding variety of body forms, colors, and powers. The Tower of Knowledge claims that dragons are elemental creatures whose very bodies adapt to whatever **habitat** they choose to lair in. Whatever the case, a dragon’s color and its breath weapon (if any) usually reflect the terrain and climate of their habitats, and dragons are often grouped into general categories on this basis. For instance, dragons that dwell in frigid tundra will often have white hides and freezing breath weapons, earning the name white dragons. See the Dragon Characteristics by Habitat table.

Dragons grow in power with **age**. A spawn will be no more powerful than a wolf, but a venerable dragon that has lived many centuries will possess titanic power. Many of a dragon’s characteristics primarily depend on its age, shown on the Dragon Characteristics by Age tables, below. To determine the age of a dragon randomly, roll 1d20! and multiply the result by 5. Determine the number of dragons encountered after determining the age. If two dragons are encountered, they will be a mated pair (if adult or older) or siblings (if juvenile or younger). If three or more dragons are encountered, they will be a mated pair (adults or older) along with their offspring. Determine the age of the offspring in years by rolling 1d10 x 5. Roll separately for treasure for each dragon by age.

A dragon’s speed and attack routine are determined by its **body form**, while its damage per attack is determined by the intersection of its age and body form. A dragon’s natural weapons deal extraordinary damage regardless of its age. Dragons come in four basic body forms, each of which has winged and wingless variants, for a total of eight possibly body form configurations. To determine a dragon’s body form randomly, roll 1d12. 1 - wingless guivre; 2 – winged guivre; 3 – wingless lindworm; 4 – winged lindworm. 5 – wingless wyvern; 6 – winged wyvern; 7 – 9 – wingless drake; 10 – 12 – winged drake. See the Dragon Characteristics by Body Form table, below.

All dragons have one special ability derived from their body form and at least one other special ability. As they age, dragons become increasingly powerful and gain additional special abilities. Winged dragons gain **clutching claws** along with flight, but pick one less special ability to compensate. Refer to the Secondary Dragon Attributes table for the number of special abilities the dragon should receive.

Some dragons are capable of speech. The older the dragon, the greater the probability that it has the capability of speech. Refer to the Dragon Characteristics by Rank table for the probability of speech. All dragons that can speak know Common, Draconic, and one other language per age category.

Dragons that can speak can also cast arcane spells at a caster level of ½ their HD. The arcane spells per day available is determined by the dragon’s age. Dragons always know the same number of arcane spells that they can cast per day. Their repertoire is innate and they have no need for spell formula or studying.

Dragons that can speak and cast spells should be counted as having one additional special ability (\*) for purposes of XP. (This is already factored into the HD entry and XP awards for Ancient and Venerable dragons, which always can speak and cast spells). If dragons are always unintelligent creatures incapable of speech in the Judge’s campaign setting, then Ancient and Venerable dragons should be assigned an additional special ability instead.

**Drake:** A drake has a quadrupedal body form resembling a large lizard. If wings are present, they are an addition to the body (giving it a total of six limbs). A drake has a speed of 90’ and, if winged, a flying speed of 240’. A drake’s attack routine consists of a pair of claw attacks and a bite attack. All drakes gain one **bonus** special ability from their body form. This body form is sometimes called “draconic” or “true dragon” form.

**Guivre:** A guivre has a limbless body form resembling a serpent. If wings are present, they are an addition to the body. A guivre has a speed of 90’ and, if winged, a flying speed of 240’. A guivre’s attack routine consists of a bite and a tail attack. All guivres possess the **constriction** special ability.

**Lindworm:**A lindworm has a legless body form with two front claws resembling a worm lizard. If wings are present, they are an addition to the body. (That is, a winged lindworm has two front claws and two wings on a legless body, for a total of four limbs. A serpentine body form with two wings and no other limbs is a winged guivre.) A lindworm has a speed of 60’ and a burrowing speed of 30’; if winged, it also has a flying speed of 180’. A lindworm’s attack routine consists of a single very powerful bite attack. All lindworms possess the **decapitating bite** special ability.

**Wyverns:** A wyvern has a bipedal body form with two vestigial arms (like a tyrannosaur). If wings are present, they replace the arms (like a bat or bird). A wingless wyvern has a speed of 120’, while a winged wyvern has a speed of 90’ and a flying speed of 240’. A wyvern’s attack routine consists of either a bite and a tail attack and, if winged, two talon attacks. All wyverns possess the **poisonous bite/tail** special ability (Judge’s choice of whether the bite or tail is poisonous).

###### Dragon Special Abilities

Select powers appropriate to the dragon’s habitat and alignment from the list below, or make up your own. Some abilities are noted as counting as only fractions of one of the dragon’s special abilities.

**Breath Weapons:**The dragon gains a breath weapon appropriate to its habitat. See **Dragon Breath Weapons**, below.

**Clutching Claws (1/2):**The dragon can make a **dive attack** with its claws (or talons). A dive attack inflicts double the normal damage dice. If the dragon hits a creature smaller than itself with both its claws or talons while making a dive attack, the creature must make a size-adjusted Paralysis saving throw. If the save fails, the creature is **grabbed**. Only winged dragons with claw/talon attacks can select this ability.

**Constriction:**On a successful tail attack, the dragon **restrains** the creature struck if it is smaller than the dragon. The restrained creature cannot move, but can still attack, cast spells, take actions in lieu of attacking, or attempt to escape. It is **vulnerable** while restrained. On the dragon’s initiative each round thereafter, it can either release or squeeze the victim. If the dragon releases the victim, it can attack another creature with its tail instead. If the dragon squeezes the victim, the victim suffers additional damage as if struck by the dragon’s tail. A constricted victim can attempt to break out of the hold on its initiative as a combat action. Breaking out of the dragon’s hold requires a successful size-adjusted Paralysis throw. A dragon can squeezed a restrained creature even if casting a spell or taking another full-round action. Only dragons with tails can select this special ability.

**Decapitating Bite:**Anytime the dragon’s bite attack succeeds on an unmodified roll of 20, the bite might decapitate its target. The creature bitten must make a Death saving throw. If the throw fails, the creature dies as its head is torn off and swallowed by the dragon. If the throw succeeds, the creature suffers quadruple dice of damage from the bite. If the dragon is gigantic, it can decapitate on 19-20; if colossal, on 18-20.

**Draconic Persuasion***:* Some dragons have a dangerous charisma about them – their voices are inviting, cloying, seductive, their bearing commanding, their eyes penetrating. Any creature that speaks with such a dragon must make a Spells saving throw. If the save fails, the creature is **bewitched** (as per the spell *bewitch humanoid* if humanoid or *bewitch monster* otherwise). If the save succeeds, the creature is thereafter immune to that particular dragon’s draconic persuasion for 1 turn. Only dragons capable of speech may select this special ability.

**Elemental Aura***:* The dragon is surrounded by an aura of elemental energy appropriate to its habitat (a red dragon might be wreathed in flame, for instance). The dragon can activate or deactivate the aura as an action in lieu of moving. While active, the aura has a radius of 1’ per HD, rounded up to the nearest 5’. Characters who begin their initiative within the aura, or enter it during their initiative, immediately suffer damage as if hit by a claw attack by a drake-form dragon of the radiating dragon’s age category. Only dragons with breath weapons can select this special ability.

**Gem-Encrusted Hide:**Thedragon’s hide is coated with gemstones and coins from centuries of lying on its treasure pile. Because of this protection, it gains a +4 bonus to AC, but its land speed is reduced by 30’. The AC bonus increases to +5 when the dragon becomes Very Old, and +6 when the dragon becomes Venerable.

**Horrific Stench:**The dragon gives off a disgusting stench. Characters who begin their initiative, or move on their initiative to, within 20’ of the dragon must make a Poison saving throw. The saving throw is at a -1 penalty if the dragon is Very Old, or -2 if Venerable. If the save fails, the creature becomes **queasy**.Queasy creatures suffer -3 to attack throws, proficiency throws, and damage rolls while in, and for 1d4+4 rounds after, leaving the dragon’s vicinity. If the save succeeds, the creature is thereafter immune to that particular dragon’s horrific stench for 1 turn.

**Lightning Reflexes (1/4):** The dragon gains a +2 bonus to initiative rolls.

**Massive Size:**The dragon is of enormous size for its age. Its Hit Dice are increased by 2, with a commensurate increase in damage from its claw and bite attacks and breath weapon. A dragon may take this special ability multiple times, representing a truly colossal specimen. Venerable dragons attack for 3d6/3d6/6d8 if this special ability is taken once and for 3d8/3d8/6d10 if the special ability is taken twice. See Legendary Dragons, below, for rules to create even larger dragons.

**Invulnerable:**The dragon is immune to mundane damage.

**Paralyzing Blows***:* Up to three of the dragon’s attacks can channel necrotic energy. Successful hits by these attacks cause the target to suffer **paralysis** for 3d4 turns unless it makes a successful Paralysis saving throw. If the dragon has only one attack in its attack routine, the saving throw is at a -2 penalty; if the dragon has two attacks in its attack routine, the saving throw is at -1. Only chaotic dragons can select this special ability.

**Poisonous Blood:**Corrosive venom flows through the dragon’s veins. Any opponent that damages the dragon in melee must make a Death save to avoid being splashed with highly venomous blood. The saving throw is at a -1 penalty if the dragon is Very Old, or -2 if Venerable. If the save fails, the opponent dies. If the save succeeds, the creature is not affected.

**Proficiency (1/8):** The dragon has a class proficiency appropriate to its powers and characteristics (Judge’s choice).

**Resistant (1/2):** The dragon is resistant to mundane damage.

**Stealthy (1/8)**: The dragon is difficult to notice. Characters encountering the dragon its natural habitat suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls.

**Swallow Attack:**On an attack throw of an unmodified 20 against a target that is at least two size categories smaller than the dragon, the dragon can swallow it whole. Swallowed creatures suffer damage equal to a talon attack by a wyvern-form dragon of the dragon’s age category every round until they die, or until the monster is killed. If a dragon ever uses a breath weapon while one or more characters are within its belly, the swallowed character(s) take(s) full damage with no saving throw permitted. If the swallowed creature has a tiny, small, or natural piercing or slashing weapon, it can attack the dragon from inside its belly with an attack penalty of -4. Should a swallowed creature die and remain in a dragon’s belly for 6 turns, he has been irrecoverably digested. If the dragon is of gigantic size, it can swallow on 19-20; if of colossal size, on 18-20.

**Swift (1/4):** The dragon moves rapidly. If wingless, its land encounter speed is increased by 30’ for every 120’ of encounter movement. If winged, its flight encounter speed is increased by 30’ for every 120’ of encounter speed. Its combat speed is adjusted by one-third the encounter speed adjustment.

**Tail Lash:**The dragon can make one additional melee attack each round, lashing out with its tail at targets to its rear. When attacking with its tail lash, the dragon inflicts the tail damage of a guivre-form dragon of its own age category. Only lindworm- and drake-form dragons can select this special ability. (Guivre- and wyvern-form dragons already have tail attacks).

**Terrifying Charge:**When the dragon completes a charge or dive attack, any creatures within 60’ must make a Paralysis saving throw. If the save fails, the creature becomes f**rightened**. If the save succeeds, the effect depends on the creature’s Hit Dice. If the creature has fewer than 2 HD, it still becomes frightened. If it has 2 HD or more, but ½ the dragon’s HD or less, the creature starts **faltering**. If it has HD equal to or greater than ½ the dragon’s HD, the creature is unaffected by terror. The terror continues until the dragon is slain or passes out of sight.

**Trample (1/4)***:* The dragon can stomp on or slither over its an opponent, dealing damage through to its immense bulk. A trample attack occurs in lieu of a dragon’s normal attack routine. The trample attack inflicts the bite damage of a guivre-form dragon of its age category. When attacking with trample, the dragon gains a +4 bonus to its attack throw if the target is at least two sizes categories small than the dragon itself.. If the trample attack succeeds against such a creature, the creature must make a Paralysis saving throw at -6. If the save fails, the creature takes damage, then is forced aside 10’ (to a point left or right of the dragon), landing **prone**. If the saving throw succeeds, the creature takes damage but is not forced aside. A dragon can cleave after a successful trample attack that forces aside a creature.

**Transformation:** The dragon can transform into another humanoid creature (as the spell *guise self*) or animal (as the spell *skinchange*) at will as an action in lieu of movement. In either case, it can ignore the ordinary constraints on size in those spells. The dragon does not gain any special abilities of the form, merely its physical characteristics, and cannot use its own special abilities while transformed except spellcasting. Only dragons capable of casting spells may select this special ability.

**Venomous Bite or Tail:**The dragon’s bite or tails carries lethal poison. Any creature damaged by the dragon’s bite or tail must make a Death saving throw. The saving throw is at a -1 penalty if the dragon is Very Old, or -2 if Venerable. If the save fails, the creature instantly dies. If the save succeeds, the creature is not affected.

**Wing / Arm Claws:**The dragon can make two additional melee attacks each round with the claws on its arms or wings. When attacking with its arms or wings, the dragon inflicts the claw damage of a drake-form dragon of its own age category. Winged guivre-, wingless lindworm-, wingless or winged wyvern-, and winged drake-form dragons can select this ability once. Winged lindworm-form dragons can select this ability twice (once for their arms and once for their wings). Wingless guivre- and wingless drake-form dragons cannot select this ability at all; the former have no claws, and the latter already attack with their foreclaws.

EXAMPLE: Critothorax is a very old winged drake-form dragon. As a very old dragon, Critothorax has 3 special abilities. Because he has the drake body form, he gains one additional special ability. Because he is winged, he gains a flight speed and the **clutching claws** special ability, but loses one special ability. Therefore he has (3 + 1 – 1) = 3 special abilities. The Judge decides that Critothorax has the following special abilities: gem-encrusted hide, resistant, swift, and terrifying charge. Since resistant and swift each count as only half of a special ability, the tally adds up correctly.

###### Dragon Breath Weapons

Dragons who select the **breath weapon** special ability are able to produce a powerful attack with a breath weapon. Though the classic breath weapon is the fire from a “fire-breathing dragon,” different dragons may breathe different kinds of effects based on their habitat.

All dragons' breath weapons deal 1d6 damage per Hit Die of the dragon. The damage type is determined by the type of breath, but is always extraordinary. Dragons with a breath weapon are immune to their own breath and to mundane damage of their breath type. They are resistant to extraordinary damage of their breath type.

A dragon’s breath weapon can have one of three potential shapes: cloud shaped, cone shaped, and line shaped. All cloud-shaped breath effects occupy an area that is 20’ high, 40’ long, and 40’ wide. Cone-shaped effects begin with a width of 2’, and spread out into a cone shape 90’ long and 30’ wide. Line shaped breath weapons have the same 5’ width for their entire 120’ lengths. Each creature within the area of effect must make a Blast saving throws. If the save fails, the creature takes full damage from the breath and possibly suffers special effects (below). If the save succeeds, the creature takes only half damage and avoids any special effects.

Breath weapons can either be limited-use or recharging. Limited-use breath weapons can be used 3 times per day. Recharging breath weapons can be used once every 1d6 rounds. If generating the dragon randomly, roll 1d6: 1-4 limited-use; 5-6 recharging.

In addition to damage, certain breath weapons have special effects, noted below:

**Acid:**The acid stream can burn through wood and metal barriers to continue beyond them to its full length. The acid deals full structural damage to metal, wood, and cloth it touches, but cannot harm stone.

**Fetid Gas:**Creatures that fail their Blast saving throws are afflicted by a noxious rotting disease which causes their body to deteriorate. They lose 1d4 points of STR, DEX, and CON each day until cured by a *cure disease*spell from a 9th level or higher cleric. If any of the character’s ability scores is reduced to 0, the character dies. Lost ability score points are recovered at a rate of 1 per day after the disease is cured.

**Blistering Steam**, **Concussive Blast**, **Freezing Vapor**, **or Poison Vapor***:* For one round after the dragon breathes, the area of effect is partly obscured by the billowing vapors, steam, or dust. Attacks into or through the area suffer a -2 penalty. Characters who have Blind Fighting ignore this penalty.

**Lightning Bolt:**The bolt damages objects in the area, dealing full damage to wood and one-tenth damage to stone. If the damage caused to an interposing barrier shatters or breaks through it, the bolt can continue beyond the barrier.

**Fire:**Thefire ignites combustibles and damages objects in the area, dealing full damage to wood and one-tenth damage to stone. If the damage caused to an interposing barrier shatters or breaks through it, the breath can continue beyond the barrier in order to attain its full volume.

###### Sleeping Dragons

When a dragon is encountered in its lair, or otherwise in a location on the ground, there is a chance that the dragon will be asleep when stumbled across. Dragons are an ancient, long-lived race, and as such they operate on a different schedule than humanoids. Dragons may sleep in a safe location for days, weeks, or sometimes years if left undisturbed. However, despite sleeping more often, older, wiser dragons generally take precautions against being caught unawares. The percentage chance that a dragon will be caught asleep when found is provided on the Secondary Dragon Attributes table. If the dragon is found asleep, it is **surprised** in the first round of the encounter. The dragon will be roused after one round regardless of whether any attacks actually make contact, and combat will progress on the second round as normal.

![](data:image/png;base64...)

###### Dragon Interaction

Because of their long history, dragons seldom take notice of the lesser insignificant intelligent races, and view them as primitive upstarts. Nonetheless, dragons are extremely intelligent and value their own lives. To this end, dragons will bargain and even surrender to characters to save their lives or otherwise richly benefit. Dragons have immense egos, and even the most evil dragon may stop to listen to the pleas or praise of a soon to be lunch.

Dragons of differing alignment will interact with other intelligent creatures in different ways. Neutral dragons might or might not converse with characters, depending on the circumstances. Lawful dragons are more likely to aid a good party or a party on a noble mission. Chaotic dragons will likely attempt to destroy a party on sight unless there is something to be gained by exercising restraint.

###### Dragon Eggs

If a mated pair of dragons without offspring is encountered in the dragons’ lair, the dragons will be incubating a clutch of 1d4 eggs. Dragon eggs fetch 600gp, weigh 8 st, and have 2 hp each. If properly incubated, dragon eggs will hatch into spawn after 1d4 x 12 months. The eggs must either be cared for by a dragon of adult age or older, or kept in a greater or supreme place of power. When born, each spawns’ body form will be identical to that of its same sex parent. All the spawn’s colors will be set by the environment in which they incubated.

###### Dragon Components

A slain dragon can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks). The components that can be harvested depend on the dragon’s age, color, and special abilities.

###### Sea Dragons

Sea dragons have the ability to breathe underwater and swim at a rate of 240’ (80’). Sea dragons are almost always guivre-form.

If wingless they stay almost exclusively in the water. If winged, sea dragons may glide over the surface of water for up to 6 rounds (1 minute) before having to land. Sea dragons live in underwater caverns where they hoard treasure from sunken vessels. They will never be found asleep above water.

A sea dragon with the **constriction** special ability can wrap its serpentine body around ships to deal structural damage each round. The shp dealt will be equal to the tail damage of a guivre-form dragon of one age category younger than itself.

###### Legendary Dragons

Some dragons are older than 700 years – much, much older – and they continue to grow with every passing year. For every full 700 years of additional age, the dragon gains two additional Hit Dice and +1 to AC. For every two additional HD, the dragon’s attack routine deals an additional 4 damage across its attacks. Legendary dragons sleep for decades or centuries at a time unless roused. They generally take precautions against being caught unawares by adventurers, though.

EXAMPLE: Born before the Day Without Night, the dragon Chrios is 4,200 years old. (4,200 – 700) / 700 = 5. Chrios has +5 AC and +10 HD and deals an additional 20 points of damage with his attack routine. Chrios, a wyvern-form dragon, has AC 17, HD 30\*\*\*\*\*\* and deals 8d6 per talon. His breath weapon deals 30d6 damage.

### Dragonfly, Giant

Giant dragonflies resemble ordinary dragonflies but have a wingspan of 6’ and a weight of 3 lbs. Their iridescent chitin is highly prized for its durability and glittering coloration.

They are mostly found in or near ponds, lakes, marshes, and rivers, but sometimes can be found in settled fields and gardens near water sources. Though beautiful, they are ferocious predators that hunt warm-blooded creatures and can be a menace to livestock. They sometimes even get a taste for human flesh.

###### Combat

Giant dragonflies have **acute hearing**, **olfaction**, and **vision.** They gain a +3 bonus to avoid surprise in their natural habitat.

Their **aerial mechanoreception** enables them to “see” up to 1350’ by sensing changes in air pressure. Spells or effects that would ordinarily cause blindness do not affect the dragonfly while it is using aerial mechanoreception. However, constructs, plants, oozes, and undead that remain motionless are invisible to the sense. Aerial mechanoreception does not penetrate structures or terrain features.

###### Ecology

Giant dragonflies do not establish nests or exhibit any parental care for their offspring. They lay their eggs either directly in water, on the leaves of aquatic plants, or in wet mud. Dragonfly eggs have 1 hp and weigh 1/300 st.

21 months later, the eggs hatch into aquatic larvae that begin feeding immediately. Dragonfly larvae have Swimming Spd 20’/60’, AC 3, HD 1, and attack with one bite (1d4 {P}).

###### Spoils

A slain giant dragonfly can be harvested with Animal Husbandry 2 for the following components useful in magic research:

* wings (3/6 st, 29gp, *flight, levitation, winged flight*)

A giant dragonfly’s iridescent carapace fetches 20gp and weighs 1/6 st.

###### Lore

*There are two formulae commonly used to impart the power of flight by means of alchemy. The first is a thaumaturgic formula that empowers a potion’s imbiber with the ability to fly without apparent means of locomotion.*

*The second is a transmogrification formula which causes the imbiber to sprout wings capable of flight.*

*Both formulae use the same reagents, the most important of which are the desiccated wings of giant dragonflies. These are traditionally sourced from the black lily marsh southeast of the capital [editor’s note: present-day Viamir Marshes].*

* Caoláin, *The Illuminated Primer of Alchemy*

### Dragon Turtle

This massive beast has the arms, legs, head, and tail of a dragon with the torso and shell of a turtle. The dragon turtle’s rough, deep green shell is much the same color as the deep water the monster favors, and the silver highlights that line the shell resemble light dancing on open water. The turtle’s legs, tail, and head are a lighter green, flecked with golden highlights. A full-grown dragon turtle measures about 130’ in shell diameter and weighs about 115,000 lbs. They can speak Draconic, though true dragons consider their accent crass.

###### Combat

Dragon turtles have **acute olfaction** that grants them a +1 bonus to avoid surprise in their natural habitat. Their **aquatic mechanoreception** enables them to “see” in water up to 270’ by sensing changes in water current and water pressure. Spells or effects that would ordinarily cause blindness do not affect the dragon turtle while it is using aquatic mechanoreception. However, creatures that are not in the water are invisible to the sense. Aquatic mechanoreception does not penetrate structures or terrain features.

Dragon turtles are **highly aggressive** (-3 penalty to reaction rolls) and frequently sink ships sailing across their territory. They can attack with their powerful claw and bite or with their **breath weapon**, a hot blistering cloud of steam 90’ long and 30’ wide that deals 36d6 {F!}damage to all creatures in its area of effect, or half that on a successful Blast save.

###### Ecology

Dragon turtles make their lairs in submerged caverns deep under the water, where they hoard wealth from ships that have sunk to the bottom of the sea.

Dragon turtles mate only a few times per century, but a dragon turtle egg can take almost a decade to hatch. When a dragon turtle is encountered in its lair, there is a 30% chance it will be a female incubating 1d2 eggs. Dragon turtle eggs have 40 hp and weigh a titanic 200 st. When a dragon turtle egg hatches, the emerging spawn is driven off by its parent immediately to avoid competition for food. Fortunately, the spawn (at AC 9 and 18 HD) is already incredibly powerful and more than capable of fending for itself.

###### Spoils

A slain dragon turtle can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the following components useful in magic research:

* beak (53 2/6 st, 3,200gp, *dismember, sharpness, swift strike,* weapon +4)
* lungs (53 2/6 st, 3,200gp*, cone of frost, swimming, water breathing*)
* shell-plates (51 4/6 st, 3,100gp, *capsizing wave, cataclysm, level water,* armor +4)

Each of a dragon turtle's two horns fetch 2d6 x 250gp and weigh 1 st per 80gp value. A dragon turtle’s armored hide fetches 17,000gp and weighs 305 st.

### Draugr

While wights of various sorts can be found in barrows throughout Jutland and Rorn, the most terrible of undead there are the draugr. Resembling huge men with swollen blue flesh emitting the reek of decay, draugr retain their human intellect – albeit an intellect riven with cruelty and a relentless desire for raw flesh and blood.

###### Combat

Draugr have the ability to use each of the following **spell-like abilities** thrice per day: *bestow curse*, *cause disease*, *cause fear*, *illumination*, *passageway,* and *tenebrosity*. They can also *skinchange* into a bull, cat, horse, or seal thrice per day. Draugr with 9 HD (or more) can use the following spell-like abilities once per week: *divination* and *summon weather*. All draugr have the ability to take *gaseous form* at will.

Sometimes draugr will equip themselves with weapons and shields selected from the grave goods in their barrows. Increase the draugr’s AC by the value of any armor or shield equipped. Draugr armed with weapons have one attack per round, dealing double damage dice by weapon. A draugr's weapons and armor are left behind if it assumes *gaseous form*. A draugr always deals extraordinary damage.

Draugr are **immune** to enchantment effects, necrotic damage, poisonous damage, and mundane bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. They are **resistant** to cold and electrical damage.

Reducing a draugr to 0 hp does not destroy the creature; it merely forces the draugr into its *gaseous form*at the start of its next initiative. Any additional damage dealt to a draugr forced into *gaseous form* has no effect. The draugr will reform with full hit points after resting in its barrow for 8 hours. If a draugr is reduced to 0 hp while in its barrow and its head cut off before its next initiative, it will be unable to enter *gaseous form*for 8 hours. During this time, if its body is then burnt and its ashes scattered in a lake, river, or ocean, the draugr is fully destroyed.

They are rendered inactive by sunlight, and prefer to slumber in their barrows during the day until nightfall or an intruder awakens them. A draugr exposed to sunlight must make a Paralysis saving throw each round at the start of its initiative. If the saving throw fails, the draugr is **helpless** until the start of its next initiative.

Anyone slain by a draugr within its barrow will rise after 24 hours as a **haugbui in thrall** to the draugr. Draugr are rebuked as vampires, but can make a Spells saving throw to ignore the effects of being rebuked while in their barrow.

###### Ecology

Draugr are restless undead. Driven by their hunger for living flesh, they often range far and wide from their barrows, even taking to the waves to plague those aboard ship. Not even the most secure tomb can contain them.

When a draugr is encountered in its barrow, it has a 10% chance per HD to be guarded by 1d6 haugbui in thrall to it.

###### Spoils

A destroyed draugr can be harvested with Healing 2 for the following component:

* cremated ashes (30 4/6 - 51 4/6 st, 1840 – 3100 gp, *bestow curse, cause disease, deflect ordinary weapons, frighten humanoid, gaseous form, giant strength, passageway, skinchange, tenebrosity; divination, summon weather* [9 HD+])

###### Encounter

Rising from the plain here is a tumulus mound of earth, some 200’ in diameter and 32’ high, now overgrown with grass. The mound is so old that it would resemble a natural hill, save for its encircling revetment of 4’ high stones. This is the barrow of an ancient warrior of grim repute, Magnhild the Dragonslayer.

Entrance to the mound was originally by means of a vaulted archway set between a pair of 10’ tall portal stones, but one of these now leans sideways and blocks the entrance. If the portal stone is moved (requiring a successful Dungeonbashing throw with -4 penalty), it reveals a long passage leading 65’ inward to a 15’ square central chamber with a corbelled roof, where a cairn of rune-carved skulls stands as a trophy of the buried hero. From the central chamber, a network of burial chambers extends in a cross-like pattern, left, right, and straight ahead. All the passage and chamber walls are made with large stones, fitted together, and have stone slab roofs 8’ above.

The three burial chambers collectively hold **6 haugbui**, who rest on sepulchers in grey burial shrouds. **Magnhild**, now a **draugr**, slumbers inside a hidden vault accessible only by means of a secret door in the central chamber. The switch to open the secret door is hidden below the cairn of skulls. (Characters who do not state they are moving the skulls will only find the switch with a successful Searching throw, but characters who actively move the skulls will automatically find the switch.)

In the draugr’s chambers are its many grave goods. 1,000ep and 4,000gp are stored in a sturdy oak chest, as well as a pair of flawless diamonds (4,000gp each) and a wrought gold goblet (900gp). A carved ivory war-horn (800gp) hangs on the wall above the chest, alongside *Drakdräpare*,a pattern-welded *two-handed sword +1, +3 v. dragons* with a hilt in the shape of a dragon,sheathed in a fine wood scabbard inlaid with ivory (500gp).

On the opposite wall is a kite-shaped shield that once belonged to the draugr’s sworn foe; it bears a death-curse (*cursed shield -1*) laid down with its wearer’s dying words. A wall-niche holds two gourds holding *oil of sharpness* and a bone case with a *scroll of ward against magic* written in Old Jutlandic.

The haugbui will awaken if anyone enters their chambers, or disturbs the cairn of skulls in the central chamber. 6 rounds after the haugbui are awakened, the draugr will enter via *passageway*(so as not to reveal the secret passage), seeking to slay those who have disturbed his rest. When it awakens, the draugr will equip itself with the *two-handed sword +1, +3 v. dragons* from its crypt*.* It always wears a rusty chainmail byrnie and an iron *ring of command human* set with bloodstones.

**Magnhild the Dragonslayer (draugr):** Spd 120’ AC 11, HD 9\*\*\*\*, hp 50, #AT 2 (claws 2+) or 1 (*two-handed sword +1* 1+), Dmg 1d10 {S!} /1d10 {S!} or 2d10+1 {S!}, Save F9, ML +3, AL C, XP 3,100; Special: hard to kill (*gaseous form* at 0hp), immunity (enchantment effects, poisonous damage, mundane bludgeoning / slashing / piercing damage), resistance (cold and electrical damage), spell-like abilities (*gaseous form* at will, *bestow curse*, *cause disease*, *cause fear*, *darkness*, *faerie fire*, *passwall, skinchange* 3/day, *divination, summon weather* 1/week,) vulnerability to sunlight (Paralysis save or helpless)

**Haugbui:** Spd 90’, AC 4, HD 3\*, hp 18, 15, 14, 13, 11, 10, #AT 2 (claws 8+), Dmg 1d8 {S!}, Save F3, ML N/A, AL C, XP 65

### Dwarf

Dwarves are short, stout demi-humans that average 4' tall but weigh as much as adult humans. Their skin can be very dark, but it is always some shade of tan or brown. Hair color can be black, gray, or brown. Dwarves favor earth tones in their clothing and prefer simple and functional garb.

They dwell in forbidding mountain ranges such as the Meniri and Jutting Mountains, where they carve great vaults from the living rock. Tunnels connect the vault to the mines, mushroom farms, and terraces wherein the dwarves toil.

###### Combat

Dwarves encountered outside a vault will be squads or companies of sentries (1st level vaultguards) on a mission or warrior pilgrimage. 50% of the sentries will be equipped with spears, hand axes, shields, and banded plate, while 50% will be crossbowmen equipped with arbalest, hand axe, and chain. All of the sentries will be **skilled warriors** who gain a +1 damage bonus.

Dwarven sentries will generally be intent on accomplishing whatever mission has brought them out of their vault. However, they revile goblins with such hatred that they will automatically have Hostile reactions to any encountered.

###### Ecology

Each squad will be led by a 2nd level vaultguard. Each company will be led by a 4th level vaultguard assisted by 2 3rd level vaultguards.

When dwarves are encountered in a vault, it will be led a dwarven vaultguard of level 5+1d4. As long as the chief is alive, the dwarves will gain a +2 bonus to morale rolls. There is a 50% chance the vault will be ministered to by a dwarven craftpriest of level 5+1d4 and a 60% chance the vault will be protected by trained animals, either 5d4 war dogs or 2d4 brown bears.

A newly-established vault will typically have few or no other residents, but in a long-established vault, additional dwarves will be present. In addition to the vaultguard companies, the vault will be protected by a militia (0th level troops) of up to 200% of the number of dwarven vaultguards. Dwarven militia have Sped 90’, AC 5, 1-1 HD, and ML 0. They are usually equipped with chain mail, shield, and war hammer or battle axe.

A long-established vault will also be home to various dwarven workers, noncombatants (adolescent, disabled, elderly, nursing, or pregnant), and juveniles up to a maximum of 850%, 850% and 1200% of the number of vaultguards respectively. Workers have Spd 120’, AC 0, 1d4 hp, ML -2, and are equipped with hand axes. Noncombatants and juveniles have Spd 90’, AC 0, 1 hp, ML -4, and do not fight. The vaultguards and militia will fight to the death to defend the noncombatants and juveniles.

Dwarven leaders should be assigned magic items using the ***ACKS II JJ***rules (p. XX).

### Elemental

There are four Elemental Sphere in orbit around the Celestial Sphere: the Spheres of Air, Earth, Fire, and Water. The elements on these spheres are alive, permeated with the divine spark of the Cosmarch; but it is a collective, subsumed into the ubiquity of the element, all dwelling in union with all. Conjuration and summoning spells, however, can tear a fragment of the living element away from its collective, instantiating it as an individual creature, an **elemental**, on the Celestial Sphere.

Whatever their element, all elementals are **immune** to enchantment effects, necrotic damage, poisonous damage, and mundane bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. They all have **lightless vision** (ranges varies by element), with other senses afforded by their element. If they possess aerial or aquatic mechanoreception, it is effective to a range equal to their movement. As incarnations, elementals can be held at bay by *holy circle* anddispelled with *counterspell* or *dispel magic*.

Because they are instantiated by the spells that conjure them, elementals understand the languages of their summoner.

###### Elemental Characteristics by Tier

Elementals come in four **tiers** of power: petty, minor, major, and supreme. Many of an elemental’s characteristics depend primarily on its tier.

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Elemental Characteristics by Tier | | | | | | |
| Rank | Size | AC | HD | Damage | Save | XP |
| Petty | Large | 5 | 4\* | 1d4 | F4 | 135 |
| Minor | Huge | 7 | 8\* | 1d8 | F8 | 1,100 |
| Major | Gigantic | 9 | 12\* | 2d8 | F12 | 2,100 |
| Supreme | Colossal | 11 | 16\* | 3d8 | F16 | 3,300 |

###### Elemental Characteristics by Element

The other characteristics of an elemental are determined by its **element**. The Elemental Characteristics by Element tables, on the adjoining page, detail these characteristics. Other notes about the different elements are below.

**Air Elementals:** Air elementals appear as twirling masses of air crackling with lightning. For every HD possessed by an air elemental, it has a diameter of 6” and a height of 2'. For instance, a supreme air elemental with 16 HD would have a diameter of 8’ and a height of 32'.

Air elementals always deal {E!}damage. They inflict double damage dice when they hit targets flying in the air. When an air elemental damages a creature smaller than itself, the creature must make a size-adjusted Paralysis save. If the save fails, the creature is spun off in a random direction to a distance equal to the height of the elemental, landing **prone**. The air elemental can cleave after spinning off a creature.

###### Elemental Characteristics by Element

**Earth Elementals:** Earth elementals appear as giant humanoids made of earth. For every HD possessed by an earth elemental, it will stand 1' tall and 6” wide. For instance, a major earth elemental with 12 HD would be 12’ high and 6’ wide. Earth elementals are unable to move through bodies of water that are wider than the elemental is tall. For example, a 12’ earth elemental can cross a 9’ stream but not a 20’ river.

Earth elementals always deal {Se!} mic damage. They deal double damage dice when they hit targets standing on the ground. When an earth elemental damages a creature smaller than itself, the creature must make a Paralysis save with a -2 penalty per difference in size. If the save fails, the creature is knocked **prone** and flung away from the elemental a distance 1’ per point of damage dealt. The earth elemental can cleave after toppling and flinging a creature.

**Fire Elementals:** Fire elementals appear as giant pillars of flame. For every HD possessed by a fire elemental, it will have a diameter of 1' and a height of 1'. For instance, a minor fire elemental with 8 HD would be have a diameter of 8’ and height of 8’. Fire elementals are unable to move through bodies of water that are wider than the elemental’s diameter.

Fire elementals always deal {F!} damage. They deal double damage dice when they hit targets that are **burning** or are carrying candles, lanterns, torches, or other open flames. When a fire elemental damages a creature, the creature must make a Blast saving throw. If the save fails, the creature starts **burning**.Itsuffering 1d8 fire damage at the start of its next initiative. The condition ends if the fire elemental is dispelled or destroyed, the burning creature dies, the flames are extinguished by immersion in water, or after 2 rounds elapse.

**Water Elementals:** Water elementals appear as a large mass of watery waves. For every HD possessed by a water elemental, it will have a diameter of 2' and a height of 6”. For instance, a petty water elemental with 4 HD would be 2' high and have an 8' diameter. Water elementals can move across land at their swimming speed but can never move further than 60' from a water source.

Water elementals always deal {C!} damage. They deal double damage dice when they hit opponents standing or submerged in water. When a water elemental damages a creature smaller than itself, the creature must make a Paralysis save with a -2 penalty per difference in size. If the save fails, the creature begins drowning.

###### Elemental Components

A destroyed elemental can be harvested with Alchemy 2. The components that can be harvested depend on the elemental’s element.

* Air - gaseous residue (*all air effects*)
* Earth - solid residue (*all earth effects*)
* Fire - burning residue (*all fire effects*)
* Water - wet residue (*all water effects*.

The value and weight of the components that can be harvested depend on the elemental’s tier:

* Petty – 135gp, 2 1/6 st.
* Minor – 1,100gp, 18 2/6 st.
* Major – 2,200gp, 36 4/6 st
* Supreme – 3,300gp, 55 st

### Elephant

Elephants are huge herbivorous mammals that stand 10’ at the shoulder and weigh around 9,000 lbs. They are native to Celdorea, Somirea, and the Ivory Kingdoms, where they are frequently used as work beasts and war mounts. The Somirean army is famous for fielding hundreds of armored war-elephants, each carrying a howdah filled with as many as a dozen troops.

They are among the most intelligent of all animals. They are capable of using tools to solve simple problems, can make complex vocalizations to coordinate activity within their herds, and have been known to bury and mourn their dead.

###### Combat

Elephants have **acute hearing** and **acute olfaction.** They gain a +2 bonus to avoid surprise in their natural habitat. Despite their size, they are gentle creatures and will usually only attack if provoked (+2 reaction rolls). If provoked, elephants prefer to start combat by **charging** with their tusks. Elephant tusks deal double damage dice (4d4 {B!}each) when used in a charge.

If closely pressed, elephants will attempt to **trample** their opponents. An elephant gains a +4 bonus to attack throws when attempting to trample a creature of large size or smaller. If a trample attack succeeds against such a creature, the creature must make a Paralysis saving throw. A small creature saves at -8, a man-sized creature at -6, and a large creature at -4. If the save fails, the creature takes damage, then is forced aside 10’ (to a point left or right of the elephant), landing **prone**. If the saving throw succeeds, the creature takes damage but is not forced aside. An elephant can cleave after a successful trample attack that forces aside a creature.

###### Ecology

When elephants are encountered, there is a 50% chance they will be a matriarchal herd. (Otherwise, it’s a bachelor herd.) In a matriarchal herd, the adults will be accompanied by 1d6-1 juvenile elephants and 1d4 baby elephants. Juvenile elephants are huge size, have AC 2, Spd 90’, HD 4+2, and attack by trampling (4d4 {B!}). Juvenile elephants can only take a +4 bonus versus and force aside small and man-sized creatures, which save at -6 and -4 respectively. Baby elephants are large size, have AC 1, Spd 90’, HD 3, and attack by stomping (1d8 {B}).

###### Spoils

A slain elephant with exceptional attributes can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following component:

* tusks (11 4/6 st, 700gp, *call of the ancient tusk, force of impetus, striking,* armor +1, weapon +3)

If not used for magic research, an elephant’s two tusks each fetch 1d6x100gp and weigh 1 st per 100gp value. An elephant’s hide fetches 165gp and weighs 24 st.

Elephants are easy to tame and train and every realm that has access to a population of the great beasts has found use for them.

### Elf

Elves are beautiful demi-humans that average 5 ½' tall, with lithe builds and graceful features. Elves are ageless, always appearing in the prime of life, and can live for upwards of two centuries if not slain in battle. Their skin is always fair, while their hair color ranges from blue-black to platinum and their eyes are amber, blue, golden, hazel, or violet. Elves prefer colorful clothes, usually with a green-and-gray cloak that blends well with the colors of the forest.

###### Combat

Elves encountered outside a haven or fastness will be fellowships or companies of warriors (1st level NPCs) on a patrol or journey. The warriors will be equipped with chain mail, short swords, and long bows.

All of the warriors will be **skilled combatants** who gain a +1 damage bonus. Because of their **attunement to nature**, the warriors alsogain a +1 bonus to surprise rolls when in the wilderness. They are **immune** to diseases caused by undead.

###### Ecology

Each fellowship of elves will be led by a 2nd level elven spellsword. Each company will be led by a 4th level elven spellsword assisted by 1 3rd level elven spellsword and 1 3rd level elven nightblade.

When elves are encountered in a fastness, they will led by an elven spellsword of level 5+1d4. As long as the leader is alive, the elves will gain a +2 bonus to morale rolls. There is a 70% chance the fastness will be protected by 2d6 trained giant raptors and a 70% chance the fastness will have a kennel with 4d6 hunting dogs. There is a 50% chance an elven nightblade of level 5+1d3 will be in the service of the leader.

A newly-established fastness will typically have few or no other residents, but in a long-established fastness, additional elves will be present. In addition to the companies, the fastness will be protected by a militia (0th level troops) of up to 200% of the number of elven warriors. Elven militia have Spd 120’, AC 3, 1 HD, and ML -1. They are usually equipped with leather armor, shield, spear, and short sword.

A long-established fastness will also be home to various elven workers, noncombatants (adolescent, disabled, elderly, nursing, or pregnant) and juveniles, up to a maximum of 850%, 850%, and 1200% of the number of warriors respectively. Workers have Spd 120’, AC 0, 1d6 hp, ML -2, and are equipped with short swords. Noncombatants and juveniles have Spd 90’, AC 0, 1 hp, ML -4, and do not fight. The warriors and militia will fight to the death to defend the noncombatants and juveniles.

Elven leaders should be assigned magic items using the ***ACKS II JJ***rules (p. XX).

###### Spoils

A slain elf can be harvested with Healing 1 for the following component:

###### Note

The 1+1 HD elven warriors in this entry are not spellswords or nightblades. Instead, they belong to an elven warrior class introduced in the upcoming sourcebook ***Before All Others***. This class grants them a fighter damage bonus and their various combat proficiencies.

### Equine, Donkey

Donkeys are sure-footed, strong, and stoic equines widely used to carry packs or pull vehicles. They are smarter and tougher than horses and, relative to their weight, considerably stronger. Donkeys are usually trained as draft animals. They can be trained for riding, but not for war.

Because of their **sure-footedness**, donkeys can be taken into the depths of a dungeon to aid in transporting equipment or treasure, and their movement multiplier in mountain hexes is x2/3 instead of x1/2. Donkeys are also **efficient grazers** and can graze for their full day’s rations with their ancillary activities, enabling them to dedicate their day to travel. They can be used in an army without a supply cost.

###### Combat

Donkeys are not as skittish as horses (Morale 0) and react differently to fear. Instead of becoming **frightened** by failed saving throws or morale rolls, a donkey becomes **frozen with fear**. It remains paralyzed, unwilling to move, until attacked or until the source of fright leaves its sight.

###### Ecology

When a donkey herd is encountered, there is a 50% chance they will be a matriarchal herd with 1d3 juveniles and 1d2 babies. (Otherwise, it’s a bachelor herd.) Juveniles have AC 0, Spd 90’, HD ½, and 1 hoof (1d2 {B}). Babies have AC -1, Spd 90’, 1 hp, ML -4, and do not fight.

Donkeys are bred for strength, speed, and stamina, and finely-bred donkeys often have exceptional attributes (see “Attributes for Monsters,” on p. XXX). Donkeys with DEX 13+ have their encounter speed adjusted by 10’ x DEX bonus. Their combat speed adjusted by one-third the encounter speed adjustment. Their ability to travel long distances quickly is limited by their stamina as well as speed, so donkeys have their expeditions peed adjusted by the lower of DEX or CON bonus x 2 miles. Donkeys with STR 13+ have their maximum load adjusted by their STR bonus x 1.5 st.

###### Spoils

A slain donkey with exceptional attributes can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following component:

* hooves (1/6 st., 10gp, *safe travels, vigor*)

###### Lore

*The bearded donkey stands about 12 hands tall and weighs about 600 lb, with gray dun, brown, red roan, and sorrel coloration. These donkeys have large heads, robust joints, and big floppy ears. Their long shaggy coats are often styled around the muzzle in a manner similar to a dwarf’s beard, hence the name.*

### Equine, Heavy Horse

Heavy horses are the largest of all equines, bred to be big, strong laborers. Most breeds of heavy horses are too placid to be trained for war, so heavy warhorses are very expensive. If trained for war, they function as noted above. Heavy horses are not usually found in the wild except through happenstance.

###### Combat

Most heavy horses are easily frightened (-2 Morale). Some heavy horses, however, can overcome their skittishness through **training for war**. War-trained heavy horses gain +2 to morale and (if a horse) one extra hoof attack. The rider of a war-trained heavy horse can attack with a charge, dealing double damage with a lance, and a war-trained equine can attack with its hooves during the charge as well.

###### Ecology

When a heavy horse herd is encountered, there is a 50% chance they will be a matriarchal herd with 1d6 juvenile horses and 1d2 baby horses. (Otherwise, it’s a bachelor herd.) Juveniles have AC 0, Spd 120’, HD 1+3, and attack with 1 hoof (1d3 {B}). Babies have AC -1, Spd 120’, HD 1+1, and attack with 1 hoof (1 {B}).

Heavy horses are bred for strength, speed, and stamina, and finely-bred specimens often have exceptional attributes (see “Attributes for Monsters,” on p. XXX). Heavy horses with DEX 13+ have their encounter speed adjusted by 12.5’ x DEX bonus. Their combat speed is adjusted by one-third the encounter speed adjustment. Their ability to travel long distances quickly is limited by their stamina as well as speed, so heavy horses have their expedition speed adjusted by the lower of DEX or CON bonus x 2.5 miles. Equines with STR 13+ have their maximum load adjusted by their STR bonus x 4 st.

###### Spoils

A slain horse with exceptional attributes can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following component:

* hooves (1 st., 65gp, *call of the galloping herd, safe travels, vigor*)

###### Lore

*While the light sandy soils of the Southern Ammasaurëan are easily worked with a scratch plough pulled by a donkey, the thick clay-rich soils of Dappakosea and Ivorea require a much heavier plough pulled by a much stronger workbeast.*

*To meet this need, the northern peoples bred a fine equine commonly called the Dappakosean draft horse, Juttish horse, and Northern workhorse. Famed for its size, strength, and sweet temperament, the breed is larger than any other found in Aurëpos. Powerful as a bear but as gentle as a fawn, its shaggy coat can be bay, black, blood bay, blue roan, chestnut, gray, or red roan.*

### Equine, Light Horse

Light horses are built for speed and long-distance travel. Domesticated light horses are found throughout Aurëpos, where they are used for riding or war. Wild light horses can be found in Opelenea, Shebatea, and Somirea.

###### Combat

Most light horses are easily frightened (-2 Morale). Some light horses, however, can overcome their skittishness through **training for war**. War-trained light horses gain +2 to morale and (if a horse) one extra hoof attack. The rider of a war-trained light horse can attack with a charge, dealing double damage with a lance, and a war-trained light horse can attack with its hooves during the charge as well.

###### Ecology

When a light horse herd is encountered, there is a 50% chance they will be a matriarchal herd with 1d6 juvenile horses and 1d2 baby horses. (Otherwise, it’s a bachelor herd.) Juveniles have AC 0, Spd 180’, HD 1/2, and attack with 1 hoof (1d2 {B}). Babies have AC -1, Spd 180’, 1 hit point, ML -4, and do not fight.

Light horses are bred for strength, speed, and stamina, and finely-bred specimens often have exceptional attributes (see “Attributes for Monsters,” on p. XXX). Light horses with DEX 13+ have their encounter movement rate adjusted by 20’ x DEX bonus. Their combat speed is adjusted by one-third the encounter speed adjustment. Their ability to travel long distances quickly is limited by their stamina as well as speed, so light horses have their expedition speed adjusted by the lower of DEX or CON bonus x 4 miles. Equines with STR 13+ have their maximum load adjusted by their STR bonus x 2.

###### Spoils

A slain horse with exceptional attributes can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following component:

* hooves (2/6 st., 20gp, *call of the galloping herd, safe travels, swift sword*)

###### Lore

*Of the light or hot-blooded horse breeds, the Opelenean is the most renowned. Prized for its grace and speed, the Opelenean is characterized by a metallic sheen to its coat. The coat itself can be buckskin, black, chestnut, cremello, dun, grey, palomino, or perlino. Palomino Opeleneans, with their shiny golden coats and white manes and tails, are common in the heroic artwork of antiquity, and often associated with crusaders of Ammonar.*

*The Shebatean is a less known, but not less worthy, breed of light horse. While it lacks the agility of the Opelenean, it has better endurance than any other hot-blood. The most common coat colors of this breed are blood bay, black, dun, grey, red roan, and white.*

*Of the Somirean breeds, however, the less said the better…*

### Equine, Medium Horse

Medium horses have been bred to be fast, strong and sturdy, but are meant for shorter distance travel. Domesticated medium horses are found throughout Aurëpos. They are neither the best riding nor draft horses, but are ideal for war, and may be trained for any of those roles. Wild medium horses can be found in Celdorea, Jutland, Krysea, Nicea, Rorn, and Tirenea.

###### Combat

Most medium horses are easily frightened. Some medium horses, however, can overcome their skittishness through **training for war**. War-trained medium horses gain +2 to morale and (if a horse) one extra hoof attack. The rider of a war-trained horse can attack with a charge, dealing double damage with a lance, and a war-trained medium horse can attack with its hooves during the charge as well.

###### Ecology

When a herd is encountered, there is a 50% chance they will be a matriarchal herd with 1d6 juvenile horses and 1d2 baby horses. (Otherwise, it’s a bachelor herd.) Juveniles have AC 0, Spd 150’, HD 1+2, and attack with 1 hoof (1d2 {B}). Babies have AC -1, Spd 150’, HD 1, and attack with 1 hoof (1 {B}).

Medium horses are bred for strength, speed, and stamina, and finely-bred horses often have exceptional attributes (see “Attributes for Monsters,” on p. XXX). Medium horses with DEX 13+ have their encounter speed adjusted by 15’ x DEX bonus. Their combat speed is adjusted by one-third the encounter speed adjustment. Their ability to travel long distances quickly is limited by their stamina as well as speed, so medium horses have their expedition speed adjusted by the lower of DEX or CON bonus x 3. Medium horses with STR 13+ have their maximum load adjusted by their STR bonus x 3 st.

###### Spoils

A slain horse with exceptional attributes can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following component:

* hooves (5/6 st., 50gp, *call of the galloping herd, safe travels, swift sword*)

###### Lore

*When Audarius Valerian Tarkaun won the Battle of Zidium, he did not just defeat the Celdorean thalassocracy; he won control of Ivorea, also known as Rorn. And that victory secured for the Empire its access to the finest breed of warm-blooded horses found anywhere in Aurëpos.*

*The Rornish horse is a proud and majestic equine with a glossy coat, a long smooth mane, and a flowing tail. Purebloods of the breed invariably have coats of either black, dapple grey, sorrel, or white, but mixed breeds of similar conformation can be found in many other colors.*

### Equine, Mule

Mules are a hybrid of a donkey and a medium horse. Mules are primarily used for draft, but can be used for riding or war. Mules are never found in the wild and never have young. Because of their **sure-footedness**, mules can be taken into the depths of a dungeon to aid in transporting equipment or treasure and their movement multiplier in mountain hexes is x2/3 instead of x1/2.

###### Combat

Mules are notoriously ornery, and may attack if particularly provoked. Like horses, mules can benefit from **training for war**. War-trained mules gain +2 to morale but does not gain an extra hoof attack. The rider of a war-trained mule can attack with a charge, dealing double damage with a lance, and a war-trained mule can attack with its hoof during the charge as well.

###### Ecology

When a mule herd is encountered, there is a 10% chance it will be accompanied by 1 medium horse, 1 donkey, 1d4 juvenile mules and 1d2 baby mules. Juveniles have AC 0, Spd 120’, HD 1, and attack with 1 hoof (1d2 {B}). Babies have AC -1, Spd 120’, HD ½, and attack with 1 hoof (1 {B}).

Mules are bred for strength, speed, and stamina, and finely-bred mules often have exceptional attributes (see “Attributes for Monsters,” on p. XXX). Mules with DEX 13+ have their encounter speed adjusted by 12.5’ x DEX bonus. Their combat speed is adjusted by one-third the encounter speed adjustment. Their ability to travel long distances quickly is limited by their stamina as well as speed, so mules have their expeditions peed adjusted by the lower of DEX or CON bonus x 2.5 miles. Mules with STR 13+ have their maximum load adjusted by their STR bonus x 2.5 st.

###### Spoils

A slain mule with exceptional attributes can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following component:

* hooves (2/6 st., 20gp, *safe travels, vigor*)

###### Lore

*From the bearded donkey and the highland pony, the dwarves produce strong and sure-footed mules with the best traits of both parents. These hardy mules are the preferred driving, pack, and riding animal among the dwarves.*

### Equine, Steppe Horse

Steppe horses are small but sturdy breeds with exceptional strength and endurance. Steppe horses can be used for draft, riding, or war. Wild steppe horses are found only in the great grasslands of western Somirea and Skysostan. Skysos nomads usually travel with at least two steppe horses each, alternating each day so they can maintain pace.

Brave, clever, and easily trained, they are **efficient grazers** and can graze for their full day’s rations with their ancillary activities, enabling them to dedicate their day to travel. They can be used in an army without a supply cost. Due to their **sturdy conformation**,steppe horses can carry a normal load of 25 st (instead of 20 st), though their maximum load is only 40 st. They have **rugged endurance** (as Endurance proficiency) and can force march for one day without penalty, plus one additional day for each point of CON bonus.

###### Combat

Most steppe horses are easily frightened (Morale -1). Some steppe horses, however, can overcome their skittishness through **training for war**. War-trained steppe horses gain +2 to morale and (if a horse) one extra hoof attack. The rider of a war-trained steppe horse can attack with a charge, dealing double damage with a lance, and a war-trained equine may attack with its hooves during the charge as well.

Steppe horses are bred for strength, speed, and stamina, and finely-bred horses often have exceptional attributes (see “Attributes for Monsters,” on p. XXX). Steppe horses with DEX 13+ have their encounter speed adjusted by 17.5’ x DEX bonus. Their combat speed is adjusted by one-third the encounter speed adjustment. Their ability to travel long distances quickly is limited by their stamina as well as speed, so steppe horses have their expeditions peed rate adjusted by the lower of DEX or CON bonus x 3.5 miles. Steppe horses with STR 13+ have their maximum load adjusted by their STR bonus x 2.5 st.

###### Ecology

When a steppe horse herd is encountered, there is a 50% chance they will be a matriarchal herd with 1d6 juvenile horses and 1d2 baby horses (Otherwise, it’s a bachelor herd.) Juveniles have AC 0, Spd 180’, HD 1, and attack with 1 hoof (1d2 {B}). Babies have AC -1, Spd 180’, HD ½, and attack with 1 hoof (1 {B}).

###### Spoils

A slain horse with exceptional attributes can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following component:

* hooves (2/6 st., 20gp, *call of the galloping herd, safe travels, vigor*)

###### Lore

*These Skysos are small men on small ponies and they shall break before our onslaught. Ready the charge.*

* Last known words of Legate Destrius Dextenor, just prior to the defeat of the 11th Imperial Cavalry by the Great Kaǧan Khabul of the Skysos.

### Ettin

Ettins are two-headed giants that stand about 17’ tall and weigh about 3,600 lbs. They seem to be related to orcs, for their faces have pig-like snouts and tusks, and some sages believe they were a poorly-bred cross of hydras with orcs, perhaps precursors to trolls.

Each of an ettin’s two heads has an independent consciousness and personality. Each head controls one arm and one leg, forcing the two to cooperate to survive. One head is usually dominant over the other, and typically gets first bite of any food and has better musculature on its “side” of the body. Despite this lopsidedness, the heads can still be quite quarrelsome about where they should go and what they should do. Many adventurers have reported seeing ettin heads arguing loudly with each other and, occasionally, pummeling each other over some difference of opinion.

Because of their orcish blood, ettins are dim-witted, dirty, and malicious. They generally wear little more than tattered skins and wield simple clubs, tree branches, or stones. Ettins can speak the bombastic language of giants as well as simple words and phrases in Common.

###### Combat

With two heads to keep watch, ettins are **twice as alert** as other creatures. They gain a +1 bonus to avoid surprise. Because ettins have **two minds in one body**, creatures encountering them make two reaction rolls, one for each head. If one head ends up Friendly and the other Hostile, the ettin might attack adventurers with one arm and attack itself with the other!

In combat, ettins can swing with their fists or weapons, dealing 3d6 {W!} damage with their dominant arm and 2d8 {W!} with their subordinate arm. When armed with piercing or slashing weapons, ettins can deliver **vicious blows** that deal an additional 2 points per swing. When armed with bludgeoning weapons, ettins can **topple** small or man-sized creatures with every swing. A small or man-sized creature struck by an ettin’s swing must make a Paralysis saving throw. If the save fails, the creature takes damage and is knocked prone. If the save succeeds, the creatures take damage but stays on its feet. The ettin can cleave if the creature fails its save against its swing.

###### Ecology

Ettins are loners, and live together in small numbers only on occasion. When 2 or more ettins are encountered in a lair, they have a 25% chance to be a family. (If not, they are just a bachelor gang.) An ettin family will be accompanied by 1d2 juveniles and 1d2 baby ettins. Juvenile ettins have AC 4, Spd 90’, HD 5, and attack with 2 swings (1d8 {B} / 1d8 {S}). Baby ettins have AC 3, Spd 90’, HD 3+1, and attack with 2 swings (1d3 {B} / 1d4 {B} damage.

### Faerie, Brownie (Boggart)

Resembling nothing so much as 2’ tall wizened, bearded old men wearing colored, pointed wool caps and brown, rough spun tunics, brownies are faeries of household and farm.

Brownies dwell hidden in the households of humans. A brownie labors nightly when the householders are asleep, invisibly performing menial chores such as cleaning away spider webs, sweeping the floor, and stacking hay bales. They avoid contact with the folks they aid, and dwell within unused areas of the house or farm. In exchange for their help, brownies expect small gifts of food, delighting in milk, cream, butter, honey, and porridge.

Failure in this tribute, idleness on the part of the people they support, taking their assistance for granted, lavish gifting, or worse – insisting that the tribute given is payment or wage – enrages these faeries.

An enraged brownie becomes Chaotic in alignment, and is called a boggart. A boggart will use its invisibility and great strength to punish the family. It will break items, set loose or attack livestock, torment children and pets, steal and hide needed tools and implements, and in some cases assault and injure those responsible, until finally fleeing to another habitation where it feels its help is more welcome.

Brownies are found in the northern shores of Aurëpos, particularly in Northern Argollë, Jutland, and Rorn. Though some dwell in Southern Argollë, they are otherwise very rare in the south, where nymphs rather than faeries reign.

They speak the lilting language of faeries and the languages spoken by dwarves, elves, and humans of their region.

###### Combat

Despite their tiny stature, brownies are **immensely strong** and gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls in melee.

Brownies are naturally **invisible**, but can choose to become visible at will. Brownie invisibility is unlike the spell of the same name in that a brownie can act freely, including attacking, without becoming visible. However, the spell *discern invisibility* will reveal its presence.

###### Ecology

Brownies have no dwelling places of their own, always lairing in the homestead of humans and demi-humans. They do not have women or children of any sort. They reproduce by transforming abandoned, orphaned, and/or unloved dwarven, elven, or human children into their own kind in magic rituals performed in places of power on holy days. The children remember their old life dimly as if a dream, which fades with time.

No brownie would ever steal a child from loving parents, but some boggarts have been known to do so – which has contributed much to the fear with which they are held.

### Faerie, Knocker

2’ tall old men with exaggerated features and large eyes, knockers are mine faeries dwelling deep within the earth. They invariably carry picks, hammers, and shovels with which they excavate and dig for metals and minerals. They bear no ill will towards dwarves and human miners as they encounter, though they are loathe to reveal themselves directly.

Indeed, given gifts of surface food and praises, knockers will warn the delvers of other folk of impending danger by loudly knocking on the rocks and tunnel walls nearby. Like most faeries, however, they are not above minor practical jokes.

Knockers are found primarily in Jutting Mountains. Because knockers possess powerful magic to delve the depths of the earth, many of the Jutting jarls have sought to enlist the aid of knockers for their great works; all such attempts have ended in disaster for the dwarves. Knockers are very rare in the Meniri Mountains, where nymphs predominate, and the Meniri dwarves insist knockers are just a wild superstition of their uncivilized brethren.

Knockers speak the lilting language of faeries and the languages spoken by the local dwarves, gnomes, and kobolds.

###### Combat

While not invisible, knockers are **naturally stealthy** when underground. Creatures encountering them suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls.

Knockers can use *earthen mire* once per hour as a spell-like ability, which they use to aid in delving for ore.

###### Ecology

Knockers dwell in vaults like dwarves – but their vaults are always curiously “off,” as if they were delved in imitation of the dwarven vaults but without an understanding of their function.

Like brownies, knockers do not count women or children of any sort as part of their number. They reproduce by transforming abandoned, orphaned, and/or unloved dwarven, goblin, gnomish, or kobold children into their own kind in magic rituals performed in places of power on holy days. The children remember their old life dimly as if a dream., which fades with time.

Knockers never steal children from loving dwarven or gnomish parents, but consider all beastmen whelps to be unloved. When the deep tunnels begin to reverberate with knocks, beastmen breeders know to keep their whelps in hand.

###### Spoils

A knocker vault will always be located near an ore deposit. See *By This Axe* p. XX for rules on ore deposits.

A slain knocker can be harvested with Healing 1 for the following component:

* eyes (1/6 st, 13gp, *lightless vision, locate treasure, shrinking*)

### Faerie, Nixie

These water faeries stand 4’ tall and look like beautiful elfin-featured men or women, the former called a nix, the latter a nixie. Their flawless skin is pale with just the slightest silvery sheen, and their expressive eyes are ever-shifting shades of blue. As mercurial as the waters they inhabit, they can be by turns helpful or vicious as the whim takes them.

Nixies are found in the northern shores of Aurëpos, particularly in Northern Argollë, Jutland, and Rorn. Though some dwell in Southern Argollë, they are otherwise very rare in the south, where nymphs rather than faeries reign.

They speak the lilting language of faeries and the languages spoken by dwarves, elves, and humans of their region.

###### Combat

The music of the nixies is entrancing and magical. As a full-round action, a nixie can sing an **enthralling song**.Once begun, the song continues until the start of the nixie’s next initiative or until it is slain. While a nixie is singing, each enemy creature within earshot (45’ in normal environments) must make a Spells saving throw at the start of its initiative. If more than one nixie sings, the creature suffers a -2 penalty for each additional nixie in earshot.

If the saving throw succeeds, the creature gains immunity to the effects of every nixie’s enthralling song until the start of its next initiative. If the saving throw fails, the creature becomes **enthralled**. On its initiative, an enthralled creature will move at combat speed towards the nearest nixie that enthralled it; if within 5’ of the nixie, the creature will remain stationary. The creature cannot take full-round actions, combat actions, or even speak, and is **vulnerable** to the nixies’ attacks. If the creature’s movement brings it into water, it starts **drowning**.

A creature remains enthralled until the effect is dispelled, the nixie is slain, or 6 turns elapse. Nixies enjoy dallying with their enthralled victims during this duration. After a nixie has played with her new “toys” for 1d6 turns she will either release them or draw them into water to drown.

Because their magic can entrance most threats, nixies rarely fight. If forced to do so, they equip themselves with daggers and other tiny weapons. Nixies can also **skinchange** into the form of a light horse once per day. In this shape they explore the land around their lair, playing tricks on any outsiders they come upon.

###### Ecology

Waterfalls, pools, gently flowing rivers: these are the places nixies call home. There they while away the hours singing and playing music.

Nixies reproduce by breathing life into elven children who have died of drowning. Grieving elven parents will often take the remains of drowned children to a beautiful lagoon or waterfall where nixies are thought to dwell. The transformations require complex magic rituals performed in places of power on holy days. The newborn nixie remembers his or her old life dimly as if a dream, which fades with time.

### Faerie, Piskie

These attractive faeries resemble 2’ tall boys and girls with elfin features and green eyes, clad in green or red clothes and caps.

Largely benign, they spend their days dancing, wrestling, and exploring. That they enjoy nothing more than riding horses or ponies, whether these belong to them or not, does not endear them to travelers. Piskies show little malice to others, though they are mischievous by nature and delight in confusing and misleading outsiders. Only the pixies and sprites are regarded with real enmity, and it is not uncommon for conflict to break about between bands of piskies and those other faeries.

Piskies have a love of finery, and the easiest way to win their cooperation is in gifting them with shiny trinkets, fine ribbons, and well-made clothing in green and red as suits their stature. (Double the bonus from Bribery when offering finery.)

Like other faeries, piskies are found primarily in northern Aurëpos, particularly in Northern Argollë, Jutland, and Rorn. Though some dwell in Southern Argollë, they are otherwise very rare in the south, where nymphs rather than faeries reign.

They speak the lilting language of faeries and the languages spoken by elves and humans of their region.

###### Combat

Piskies are notorious for their ability to confound and confuse those that encounter them. Every piskie can use *incite madness* at will as a spell-like ability. If forced to fight, piskies arm themselves with tiny bows (the size of slingshots), lances (the size of javelins) and swords (the size of daggers). They sometimes ride foals or ponies into battle.

###### Ecology

Piskies live within barrows or beneath stone circles, dolmens, and menhir. They will not dwell in places of death that have become sinkholes of evil, however.

They reproduce by breathing life into elven infants who have died of accident or injury. When an elven child dies from a horseback fall or other mishap, the parents will often pray the piskies will come for the body so that their child might live on as a piskie. The transformations require complex magic rituals performed in places of power on holy days. The newborn piskie remembers his or her old life dimly as if a dream, which fades with time.

When piskies are encountered in a wilderness lair, there is a 70% chance that there will be a herd of wild horses grazing in the vicinity.

###### Spoils

### Faerie, Pixie

Pixies resemble elves, save for their diminutive size (2’ tall) and insect- like wings. Like elves and unlike many other faeries, pixies come in two sexes, male and female, though both sexes have gracile forms and high piping voices.

Like other faeries, pixies are found primarily in northern Aurëpos, particularly in Northern Argollë, Jutland, and Rorn. Though some dwell in Southern Argollë, they are otherwise very rare in the south, where nymphs predominate.

Pixies speak the lilting language of faeries and the languages spoken by the elves and humans of their region.

###### Combat

While pixies can fly, they have **weak wings.** A pixie can only fly for 3 turns before needing to land and rest its wings for 1 turn.

Pixies are naturally **invisible**, but can choose to become visible at will. Pixie invisibility is unlike the spell of the same name in that a pixie can act freely, including attacking, without becoming visible. However, the spell *discern invisibility* will reveal its presence.

They arm themselves with tiny bows that fire dart-sized arrows and with tiny swords the size of daggers. They prefer to attack by aerial ambush with their bows. They are **precise shots** capable of firing even into the chaos of melee.

###### Ecology

Pixies dwell in treetop fastnesses similar to wood elves – but their fastnesses are always curiously “off,” as if they were built in imitation of elven architecture but without an understanding of their function. They often feature miniature staircases, for instance, even though pixies can fly.

They reproduce by breathing life into elven infants who have died of illness or infection. When an elven child dies it is a tragedy, but if the child’s body vanishes soon thereafter, the parents can stop grieving, knowing their child will live on as a pixie. The children remember their old life dimly as if a dream, which fades with time. The transformations require complex magic rituals performed in places of power on holy days.

### Faerie, Redcap

The most vile and vicious of the fae, redcaps are sinewy old men with sharp, elongated teeth, filthy clawed fingers, and staring red eyes. They wear tarnished mail on their bodies, rusty iron boots on their feet, and woolen caps on their heads, stained red with the blood of those they kill, and carry jagged iron spears.

Redcaps live a solitary life, actively hunting such lone or weak-looking wanderers or beasts as venture too close. When a victim is slain, the redcap dips its cap in the blood before settling down to feast.

Like other faeries, redcaps are found primarily in northern Aurëpos, particularly in Northern Argollë, Jutland, and Rorn. Though some dwell in Southern Argollë, they are otherwise very rare in the south, where nymphs rather than faeries are found.

Redcaps speak the lilting language of faeries and the languages spoken by the local gnoll, hobgoblin, and orc tribes.

###### Combat

Redcaps are **preternaturally fast**. They gain a +2 bonus to initiative rolls and have a combat speed of 120’ per round. As proficient **skirmishers**, they do not suffer an AC penalty when charging or running and can withdraw or retreat from melee combat without declaring the intention to do so at the start of the melee round.

Redcaps prefer to hunt their targets with spears, with which they gain a +1 damage bonus. They can resort to tooth and claw if the spear is broken or if they are feeling particularly bloodthirsty.

Many a would-be hero has found to their ultimate cost that redcaps are quite hard to kill. Redcaps are **immune** to all mundane damage. However, if the blood staining a redcap’s hat every fully dries (which takes 24 hours), the redcap is irrevocably slain.

###### Ecology

Redcaps dwell in abandoned hill forts and other ruins that littler Jutland and Ron. Like brownies and knockers, redcaps do not have women or children of any sort. They reproduce by transforming particularly vicious or ugly gnoll, hobgoblin, or orc whelps into their own kind in magic rituals performed in places of power on unholy days. The newborn redcaps remember their old life dimly as if a dream, which fades with time.

Redcaps do not have to work hard to find victims, because beastmen shamans will regularly offer up whelps from the tribe to them in exchange for alliance and aid.

###### Spoils

A slain redcap can be harvested with Healing 1 for the following component:

* bloody scalp (2 2/6 st., 135gp, *physical protection (all), safe travels, swift sword*)

### Faerie, Spriggan

Standing just over 4’ tall, spriggans resemble gnarled, nasty old men with overlarge heads clad in rough clothing and leather. They are as malicious as they are ugly.

Like other faeries, spriggans are found primarily in northern Aurëpos, particularly in Northern Argollë, Jutland, and Rorn. Though some dwell in Southern Argollë, they are otherwise rare in the south, where nymphs rather than faeries are found.

Spriggans speak the lilting language of faeries and the languages spoken by goblins, gnomes, and humans of their region.

###### Combat

Spriggans can **summon weather** as a spell-like ability once per day. They use this power to draw ominous and unpleasant weather to their lairs, discouraging outsiders from approaching, or to punish local settlements with drought, frost, or storm.

Far more formidable, however, is their ability to grow in stature. A spriggan can **enlarge** as a spell-like ability at will. While enlarged, the spriggan stands 8’ tall and weighs 480 lbs. Its strength increases proportionately, such that it gains +2 to melee attack throws and deals an additional die of damage with every physical attack. The damage dealt is extraordinary. The spriggan also gains a +8 bonus to Dungeonbashing proficiency throws and doubles its normal carrying capacity.

###### Ecology

Bandits and thieves by nature, spriggans lair in ruins and cairns, jealously guarding their ill-gotten gains, leaving only to raid and steal from others or to hire out their services as mercenaries and guards. As with all faeries, they are found primarily in the northern reaches of Aurëpos.

Like redcaps, spriggans do not have women or children of any sort. They reproduce by stealing the young children of goblins, gnomes, dwarves, halflings, or humans, turning them into their own kind in magic rituals performed in places of power on unholy days. The newborn spriggan remember its old life dimly as if a dream, which fades with time.

###### Spoils

A slain spriggan can be harvested with Healing 1 for the following component:

### Faerie, Sprite

Sprites are reclusive fey creatures that appear as 1' tall winged elves. They delight in dancing and frolicking and giggle as often as they speak. Sprites are not malicious, but are mischievous, and enjoy playing tricks on other creatures.

Like other faeries, sprites are found primarily in northern Aurëpos, particularly in Northern Argollë, Jutland, and Rorn. Though some dwell in Southern Argollë, they are otherwise very rare in the south, where nymphs rather than faeries are found.

Sprites speak the lilting language of faeries and the languages spoken by gnomes, halflings, and humans of their region.

###### Combat

Every sprite can use *bestow curse* as a spell-like ability once per day. The curse will never cause physical harm or illness, but will instead be embarrassing or humorous. The Judge can roll 1d10 on the Sprite Curse table or devise their own.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Roll (1d10) | Curse |
| 1 | Skin becomes dotted or striped |
| 2 | Ears grow into donkey ears |
| 3 | Voice transform into that of a little girl |
| 4 | Suffers hair loss in an embarrassing pattern |
| 5 | Must always tell the truth no matter what |
| 6 | Speaks all his words and sentences backward |
| 7 | Develops a speech impediment (lisp, etc) |
| 8 | Randomly punctuates speech with profanity |
| 9 | Becomes obsessed with counting things |
| 10 | Thinks he is a vampire, fears daylight, garlic |

The curse lasts indefinitely until cured with *remove curse*, the sprite stops sustaining the curse, or the sprite sustaining it is slain.

Sprites do not carry weapons or fight. If attacked, they will scatter in flight to hide.

###### Ecology

Sprites dwell in tiny smials (civilized burrows) that resemble those of halflings. However, the structure of the smials never quite makes sense, as if it were built in imitation of the appearance without an understanding of the function. They have doors that do not open, staircases that lead nowhere, etc.

They reproduce by transforming abandoned, orphaned, and/or unloved gnomish or halfling children into their own kind in magic rituals performed in places of power on holy days. The children remember their old life dimly as if a dream, which fades with time.

They never steal children from loving parents. Nevertheless, gnomish and halfling mothers frequently warn naughty toddlers that they’ll be carried off by the sprites if they misbehave.

### Faravahar

Faravahar are ancient creatures whom sages believe led the Empyrean faction in the cosmic war that ended on the Day Without Night. Some texts imply they have operated as messengers or prophets of the Empyrean gods in elder ages, and it is believed that those who are truly dedicated to Law will find them staunch allies and wise counsels.

Depicted in ancient artwork as winged wise men, Faravahar are actually avian humanoids with owlish heads with colored feathers about the head and neck that give the impression of beards. An adult faravahar stand about 8’6” tall and weigh about 410 lbs. Faravahar coloring tends to bronze and gunmetal; rarely intruding into copper and silver, sometimes dyed into jewel tones. Their hind legs end in six talons, strong enough to clutch to sheer surfaces but nimble enough to wield tools and weapons. Their forearms and hands are dexterous but slender, used for delicate work.

Faravahar speak their own ancient tongue, which resembles Proto-Danean, as well as Argollëan, Classical Auran, and Common.

###### Combat

Faravahar have **acute vision** and gain a +1 bonus to avoid surprise in their natural habitat. They can **cast arcane and divine spells** as Nobiran Wonderworkers of their HD. Blessed with **divine health**, they are immune to diseases, including magic diseases.

Because their forearms cannot wield weapons, faravahar prefer to fight from the air, attacking with their talons in melee, using their talons to fire crossbows at range, or blasting their foes with spells. Faravahar can remain stationary (hover) while flying in order to cast spells.

###### Ecology

Faravahar are today found only in isolated highlands where they can build against sheer cliff sides or inaccessible mountaintops. They favor open, airy architecture that blends in with the surrounding area but often set up labyrinthine vertical tunnels for storage or as a defensive measure.

Each faravahar wing will be led by a spara with 9 HD and 54 hp. Each faravahar settlement will be led by a satrap with 11 HD and 66 hp. Faravahar reproduce rarely, so settlements will have only a small number of offspring. Roll 1d4: 1, 2d3 faravahar eggs; 2-4, 2d3 juvenile faravahar. Juvenile faravahar have AC 3, Spd 45’ / 150’, HD 4, and attack with 2 talons (1d8). Eggs have 1 hp and weigh 1/6 st.

###### Spoils

A slain faravahar can be harvested with Animal Husbandry or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the following components useful in magic research:

* brain (10 st, 600gp, any detection effect)
* hands (8 2/6 st., 500gp, *cure disease, cure injury, earth’s movement, level water*)
* head and neck feathers (8 2/6 st., 500gp, *flight, vigor*)
* heart (8 2/6 st., 500gp, *atonement, communion*)

### Fish, Giant Catfish

These scaleless ash-colored fish are both predators and scavengers. The giant catfish reaches a length of about 15' and weight of around 2,700 lbs. Various sub-species can be found throughout the rivers, lakes, ponds, estuaries, coasts, and swamps of Aurëpos. They tend to stay near the bottom of the water where logs, vegetation, mud, and sand can provide shelter.

###### Combat

Giant catfish have highly developed olfactory rosettes which afford them **acute olfaction**. They gain a +1 bonus to avoid surprise in their natural habitat. They can track the scent of blood in the water for up to 2 miles with the equivalent of one rank of Tracking proficiency.

They can use their whiskers for **aquatic mechanoreception**,enabling them to “see” in water up to 480’ by sensing changes in water current and water pressure. Spells or effects that would ordinarily cause blindness do not affect the catfish while it is using aquatic mechanoreception. However, creatures that are not in the water are invisible to them. Aquatic mechanoreception does not penetrate structures or terrain features.

In combat, giant catfish can attack with their four whisker-like feelers and their vicious bite.

###### Ecology

Unlike most fish, a giant catfish extends parental care towards its offspring. The female deposit the eggs in a nest dug by the male, and the male then guards the nest and aerates the eggs until they hatch. Therefore, when a nest of giant catfish is encountered, the fish will be guarding 4d6 x 10 eggs. Giant catfish eggs have 1 hp and weigh 1/20 st.

###### Spoils

A slain giant catfish can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following component:

* feelers (10 st, 600gp, *swift strike, telekinesis*)

###### Encounter

The swampy waters have grown murky with mud stirred up the **giant catfish** that lurks here. The giant catfish, a male of exceptional size and strength, is guarding a nest of **180 eggs** that were recently lain by his now-deceased mate. The male is both angry and anxious, and will attack any creatures that approach unless they achieve Friendly reactions.

**Giant catfish:** Str 18; Spd 90’ swim, AC 5, HD 8, hp 41, #AT 5 (bite, 4 feelers 0+), Dmg 2d8+6 {P} /1d4+3 {B}, Save F4, ML 0, XP 600

### Fish, Giant Piranha

These giant carnivorous fish can reach a length of 5' and weight of up to 750 lbs. Giant piranha were natively found only in the warm rivers and lakes of Ulruk, but in the 9th century B.E. the Zaharans bred a sub-species adapted to the cooler waters of Aurëpos that has proliferated widely.

###### Combat

Giant piranha have **acute vision** that grants a +1 bonus to avoid surprise in their natural habitat. They also have a lateral line system that affords them **aquatic mechanoreception**. Piranha can “see” in water up to 180’ by sensing changes in water current and water pressure. Spells or effects that would ordinarily cause blindness do not affect the piranha while it is using aquatic mechanoreception. However, creatures that are not in the water are invisible to them. Aquatic mechanoreception does not penetrate structures or terrain features.

The creatures attack nearly anything that moves, and are always hostile when encountered. As many as 8 giant piranhas can attack a single victim at a time!

Worse, if any creature in the water is injured with piercing or slashing damage, the blood will trigger a **feeding frenzy** in all piranha within 60’. When frenzied, piranha fight to the death and never check morale.

###### Ecology

Unlike most fish, a giant piranha extends parental care towards its offspring. The female deposit the eggs in a nest dug by the male, and the male then guards the nest and aerates the eggs until they hatch. Therefore, when a nest of giant piranha is encountered, the fish will be guarding 3d6 x 10 eggs. Giant catfish eggs have 1 hp and weigh 1/50 st.

###### Spoils

A slain giant piranha can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following component:

### Fish, Giant Rockfish

These giant fish grow to a length of about 20’ and weight of 6,800 lbs. They can be found anywhere from shallow coastal waters to abyssal depths, but they especially favor rocky outcrops, reefs, and kelp forests in cold water.

###### Combat

Giant rockfish’s scaley bodies closely resemble the rocky sea surface that they call home, and characters encountering the rockfish suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls due to this **natural stealth.**

Giant rockfish rely on a lateral line system that affords them **aquatic mechanoreception**. They can “see” in water up to 300’ by sensing changes in water current and water pressure. Spells or effects that would ordinarily cause blindness do not affect the rockfish while it is using aquatic mechanoreception. However, creatures that are not in the water are invisible to them. Aquatic mechanoreception does not penetrate structures or terrain features.

The giant rockfish’s spines carry a **deadly venom**. Any creature damaged by a spine must make a Death saving throw. If the save succeeds, the creature is not affected by the venom. If the save fails, the creature dies at the end of the rockfish’s initiative.

If a creature accidentally steps on or stumbles into a hidden rockfish, the creature is automatically struck by all four spines, each dealing 1d4 x 4 piercing damage and requiring a Death saving throw.

###### Ecology

Giant rockfish do not establish nests or exhibit any parental care for their offspring. They rely on pelagic spawning, in which the female releases her eggs into the water column and the male externally fertilizes them. The eggs are buoyant and simply float until they hatch.

###### Spoils

A slain giant rockfish can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following components useful in magic research:

* gills (1 st, 60gp, *water breathing, swimming*)
* poisoned spines (3 2/6 st, 200gp, *neutralize poison, poison*)
* rocky scales (3 2/6 st, 200gp, *chameleon*)

A giant rockfish’s venom (onset time 1 round, +1 saving modifier, target suffers 5d6 {Po} damage on failed Death saving throw) fetches 450gp and weighs 1/6 st.

### Fish, Giant Sturgeon

These immense gray scaly fish can reach a length of 30' and weight of 20,500 lbs. They can be found in the rivers, lakes, and coastal waters of Aurëpos and Danea. They typically are born in freshwater, migrate to the ocean to grow, and return to freshwater to spawn.

###### Combat

Giant sturgeons possess long whisker-like sensory organs called barbels that give them the best **aquatic mechanoreception** of any giant fish. They can “see” in water up to 600’ by sensing changes in water current and water pressure. Spells or effects that would ordinarily cause blindness do not affect the sturgeon while it is using aquatic mechanoreception. However, creatures that are not in the water are invisible to them. Aquatic mechanoreception does not penetrate structures or terrain features.

If a giant sturgeon succeeds on a bite attack against a creature of large size or less with an unmodified throw of 19 - 20, it can **swallow** the creature. The swallowed creature suffers 2d6 acidic damage at the start of its initiative each round and drowns after 10 rounds. Each time it suffers acidic damage, the swallowed creature must make a Paralysis saving throw. If the save fails, the creature is **paralyzed** for 2d4 turns. If the swallowed creature has a tiny, small, or natural piercing or slashing weapon, it can attack the sturgeon from inside its belly with a -4 penalty. Should a swallowed creature die and remain in the sturgeon’s belly for 6 turns, it is irrecoverably digested. The sturgeon can cleave after swallowing a creature.

###### Ecology

Giant sturgeon do not establish nests or exhibit any parental care for their offspring. They rely on broadcast spawning, in which the female deposits her eggs widely onto the various rocks, gravel, and vegetation found on the riverbed, and the male externally fertilizes them.

###### Spoils

Because of their propensity to swallow creatures whole, any encounter with giant sturgeons can yield treasure, whether wandering or in lair. The treasure (if any) is always found inside the creature’s belly.

A slain giant sturgeon can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following components useful in magic research:

* skull (13 2/6 st, 800gp, armor +2, weapon +2)
* stomach (12 3/6 st, 750gp, *circle of agony, create chasm, find treasure, swimming*)

A giant sturgeon's armored hide fetches 2,000gp and weighs 54 stone. Its teeth fetch 20gp and weigh 2/6 st.

### Flay Fiend

A flay fiend is a horrific undead creature created by painstakingly removing the intact skin from a humanoid creature and then animating it with necromantic energies. Most necromancers use skin from a fresh corpse to create their flay fiends, but in Ancient Zahar the skin was harvested from still-living victims. The priestesses of Nasga considered it a sublime art to flay a comely captive in such a way as to maximize the victim’s agony while preserving the skin’s beauty.

Flay fiends have only the barest flicker of sapience so any instructions given to a skeleton by its creator or controller must be very simple. In the absence of orders or opponents, flay fiends remain stationary, as if they were curtains or carpets.

###### Combat

A flay fiend moves like a slug with an undulating crawl. It attacks by engulfing its target, slowly crushing and suffocating it. The victim's struggles clearly visible within the thin skin.

Because it envelopes its target in its voluminous skin, a flay fiend can ignore the target’s AC from armor (but not AC from DEX, magic items, natural armor, or spells) when it attacks. If its attack succeeds, the target suffers 1d4 {B!}damage and becomes **grabbed** (p. XX). Thereafter the flay fiend can use its combat action to automatically constrict the grabbed target for another 1d4 {B!}damage. If the flay fiend constricts a creature that requires respiration for 5 consecutive rounds, the creature dies of suffocation. Once it begins constricting a target, a flay fiend will continue to constrict it until the target dies or the flay fiend is destroyed or ordered by its controller to stop. Any damage dealt to a flay fiend that has grabbed a creature is divided evenly between it and the grabbed creature.

Like all undead, flay fiends are **immune** to enchantment effects, necrotic damage, and poisonous damage. Because of their malleable, yielding form, flay fiends are also **resistant** to arcane, bludgeoning, and seismic damage. They are inherently evil for purposes of *discern evil*and *holy circle*spells and can be rebuked as zombies.

###### Ecology

Flay fiends are generally found only in the lairs or former lairs of powerful necromancers or in ancient ruins dating to Thrassian or Zaharan times.

###### Spoils

A destroyed flay fiend can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the following components useful in magic research:

* skin sack (2/6 st., 19gp, *choking grip, circle of agony, physical protection (bludgeoning)*)

### Fly, Giant Carnivorous

The origin of giant carnivorous flies is unknown, but some Auran sages believe they were created by the ancient elves in order to cleanse their forests of giant killer bees and spiders.

Giant carnivorous flies resemble ordinary flies, save that they measure 3' long and weigh 4lbs. They carry golden-yellow markings on their ebony carapaces that make them resemble giant bees.

###### Combat

Giant flies have **acute olfaction** and gain a +1 bonus to avoid surprise in its natural habitat. They can “see” by means of **aerial mechanoreception** (60’). They are **naturally stealthy** when in their native habitat, and creatures encountering them suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls.

By preference they prey on giant killer bees, spiders, and other venomous vermin. They are **immune** to the poisonous damage dealt by arane, attercops, giant killer bees, giant wasps, and giant spiders.

In combat, a giant carnivorous fly attacks with its long proboscis, which ejects a corrosive agent that deals 1d8 acidic damage. If the acidic damage reduces their target to 0 or fewer hp, the fly immediately sucks up its dissolved flesh, killing it instantly.

###### Ecology

When a nest of giant carnivorous flies is encountered, there is a 5% chance per fly that it will have recently laid 2d6 eggs nearby. The eggs have 1 hp and weigh 1/1000 st (1 coin). Carnivorous maggots are rarely found in nests, because the larvae immediately disperse into the wild after they emerge from their eggs. The maggots will pupate into giant carnivorous flies after 6 months of feeding.

###### Spoils

A slain giant carnivorous fly can be harvested with Animal Husbandry 2 for the following component:

* tarsal segments (3/6 st, 29gp, *leaping silent step*)

###### Encounter

The fallen hollow log of a gnarled old teak tree is the lair of **ten giant carnivorous flies**. The flies will leap out to attack any prey that approaches within 30’.

Inside the hollow are the remains of the flies’ recent victims – a black bear, a deer, and an elderly goblin. A pair of claws (3gp each) can be harvested from the bear, while the goblin’s corpse has a broken dagger with a scrimshaw hilt (30gp), a carved bone figurine of Iskara, Mother of Monsters (25gp), and a small pouch holding 1 lb of woundwort (10gp). The goblin’s eye sockets are empty and surrounded by old scar tissue.

### Frog, Giant

The giant frog, sometimes called the terror of the marshlands, is a massive amphibian measuring about 4’ long and 2’6” high and weighing up to 200lbs.

###### Combat

Giant frogs have **acute olfaction** and gain a +1 bonus to avoid surprise in its natural habitat. When in dark, damp environments such as bogs and swamps, giant frogs are **naturally stealthy**. Creatures encountering them in such habitats suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls.

The giant frog is slightly smaller than closely-related giant toad (p. XX), and lacks its ability to swallow its victims whole. However, a giant frog can make **titanic leaps**. As a movement action, it can jump up to 30’ in any direction (90’ if outdoors). If it **jumps on a creature**, the creature must make a Paralysis saving throw. If the save fails, the creature is knocked **prone** and the frog can immediately bite it with a +2 bonus to its attack throw and damage roll. If the save succeeds, the creature retains its footing. The frog can still bite it, but does not gain any bonus.

###### Ecology

Giant frogs do not care for their young and in fact may feed on them when other food sources aren’t available. When giant frogs are encountered in their lair, there will be a spawning pool somewhere nearby with a total of 1d6 x 100 giant 5”-long tadpoles. Giant tadpoles have AC 0, Spd 60’, 1 hp, ML -4, and do not fight.

Giant tadpoles eventually metamorphize into juvenile giant frogs and exit the spawning pool. Juvenile giant frogs are essentially indistinguishable from common frogs and are not usually noticed by adventurers. From time to time, however, a young boy or girl will capture a frog as a pet only to discover its true nature when it doesn’t stop growing…

###### Spoils

A slain giant frog can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following component:

* forelegs (3/6 st, 29gp, *chameleon, leaping*)

Being both stupid and surly, giant frogs are rarely tamed and trained. Even a trained specimen is not considered worth the cost of its handlers.

###### Lair

From the marshy waters rises a low hummock forested with black alders and willows. The hummock is the lair of a **pair of giant frogs**, while the waters around the hummock squirm with **200 giant tadpoles**. The frogs have lately fed only on their own spawn and will delight in the opportunity for a fresh meal. The frogs have no treasure.

**Giant frogs (2):** Spd 120’ / 120’ swim, AC 3, HD 2\*, hp 11, 8, #AT 1 (bite 9+), Dmg 1d4 {P}, Save F1, ML -2, XP 29; Special: naturally stealthy, titanic leap

### Fungus, Shrieking

A shrieking fungus, sometimes called a shrieker, is a sessile fungus that grows in dark, subterranean places. Resembling a 3’ tall mushroom, shriekers are pale lavender to dull gray in color, dotted with purple spots. Shrieking fungi closely resemble violet fungi, with which they often grow in symbiotic patches. They are named for their notorious propensity for making a loud noise when disturbed. Found in dank caves, damp dungeons, and other dark, wet locations underground, they are virtually never seen on the surface. Some sporecasters have claimed that shrieking fungi can grow in the dank flesh of birds or mammals. However, this has not been confirmed by the sages of the Tower of Knowledge, who found the whole investigation rather appalling.

###### Combat

Shrieking fungi lack the senses of ordinary animals. However, the spots on their caps are **photosensitive** and can detect light to a range of 60’. They also **echolocate**,emitting a constant subsonic hum with which they can “see” to a range of 30’.

Immediately upon detecting light or movement, shriekers begin to emit the wailing scream that gives them their name. Once a shrieker starts shrieking, it continues to do so each round that it detects light or movement and for 1d3 rounds thereafter, or until it is killed.

A single shrieker’s screams can be heard to a range of 320’ in ordinary environments (double the range in quiet environments, halve it in loud environments); for each additional shrieker, the range of earshot is increased by 30’. If there are any stocked monsters within earshot, they will respond to the alarm at the Judge’s discretion.

In addition, if there are wandering monsters in the dungeon, the Judge will make an encounter throw every round that the shriekers scream. If the throw results in an encounter, the wandering monsters attracted by the shrieker(s) will arrive in 2d6 rounds.

Shrieking fungi are **immune** to enchantment effects and to poisonous damage (except from poisons specifically designed to work on fungi).

###### Ecology

Shrieking fungi reproduce biannually by dispersing tiny spores that are invisible to the naked eye. These spores are then carried by underground air currents throughout the subterranean environment. Attempts to breed shrieking fungi in captivity have failed,

Due to their symbiotic relationship with violet fungi, anytime a patch of shrieking fungi is encountered, there is a 20% chance they will be intermingled with a patch of 1d4 violet fungi.

###### Spoils

A destroyed shrieking fungus can be harvested with Alchemy for the following component:

Shrieking fungi are inedible to humans and demi-humans, who become **queasy** for 1d8 hours approximately 1 turn after ingesting them.

### Fungus, Violet

Violet fungi are large animate mushrooms that can vary in color from an overall purple hue to a dull gray or violet covered with purple spots. They closely resemble shriekers, with which they often grow in symbiotic patches: When the shriekers’ hellish racket attracts a curious creature, the violet fungus tries to kill it. Both fungi enjoy the fruits of a successful hunt, as the decomposing matter of the slain creature feed growth.

Unlike the sessile shriekers, however, violet fungi are mobile. A violet fungus can slowly move across the ground by expanding and contracting its stipe, undulating somewhat like an upright caterpillar. Violet fungi are found in dank caves, damp dungeons, and other dark, wet locations underground. They are virtually never seen on the surface.

###### Combat

Violet fungi “see” by means of **terrestrial mechanoreception**,enabling the fungus to sense vibration in the ground over long distances equivalent to line of sight in full daylight. Spells or effects that would ordinarily cause blindness do not affect the fungus. However, creatures that are flying, levitating, or otherwise not touching the ground are invisible to it. Terrestrial mechanoreception can penetrate structures and terrain features.

A violet fungus has four tentacles that secrete a lethal toxin carried in black oily spores. Any creature damaged by a tentacle must make a Death saving throw. If the save succeeds, there is no effect. If the save fails, the creature becomes **queasy** immediately and will die in 2d6 turns.

Violet fungi are **immune** to enchantment effects and to poisonous damage (except from poisons specifically designed to work on fungi).

###### Ecology

Violent fungi reproduce biannually by dispersing tiny spores that are invisible to the naked eye. These spores are then carried by underground air currents throughout the subterranean environment.

The fungi themselves also tend to meander through the underdark, at least until they find a patch of shrieking fungi to nestle within. Anytime a patch of violet fungi is encountered, the violet fungi will always be accompanied by a patch of 1d8 shriekers.

###### Spoils

A destroyed violet fungus can be harvested with Alchemy for the following components useful in magic research:

* oil spore (1 1/6 st., 70gp, *neutralize poison*, *poison*)
* tentacle (1 st., 665p, *forest enchantment, plant growth*)

Violet fungi poison can be extracted (250gp, onset time 3d6 turns, +2 saving modifier, target suffers 3d6 {Po} damage on failed Death saving throw).

### Galdrtré

Sometimes a tree sinks its roots deep into a place of power. Over the years, it drinks up the magic, which seeps into its very trunk and branches, giving it a strange sort of life. The Jutlanders call such a tree a galdrtré, and consider them sacred.

Galdrtré are sapient and communicative, but their voices are indistinguishable from leaves rustling or branches waving except to other plants or those able to *speak with plants.* They are wise in wood-lore and sometimes consulted by shamans.

###### Combat

At will, galdrtré can use a full-round action to wave its fronds and branches to cause an **enchanting whistle audible** at up to 180’ away. Any creature hearing the whistle must succeed on a Spells saving throw or become **enthralled** by the galdrtré until the end of the galdrtré’s next initiative.

Once per day, a galdrtré can use a full-round action to **summon a soporific mist** that surrounds itself in a 30’ radius. Any creature that begins its initiative in, or moves into, the area of effect must make a Paralysis save. If the save fails, the creature starts **slumbering**.If the save succeeds, the creature is not affected that round. The mist disperses after 1 turn unless dispersed by e.g. magic wind.

A galdrtré can attack targets up to 20’ away from its trunk using its twining roots and gnarled branches. If the galdrtré succeeds on an attack against a man-sized or smaller creature with an unmodified throw 20, it can pull the creature into **a gaping hollow** its trunk. A creature pulled into the hollow is immediately **stuck.** The stuck creature suffers 2d6 {B!} damage at the start of its initiative each round until it escapes or the galdrtré is destroyed.

If necessary, a galdrtré can tear itself from the ground and walk on its roots at the (slow) combat speed of 5’. However, the trees are loathe to leave and quick to return to the vicinity of the magic which animates them. A galdrtré loses 1 HD each hour it is absent from its source.

Galdrtré cultivate **bee-hives** within their branches. If the tree is disturbed, the bees will buzz out of the hive at the end of the tree’s next initiative to protect it. The bees form a 4 HD insect swarm. They will pursue enemies up to 150’ from the tree.

Galdrtré have tough bark that makes them **immune** to mundane piercing damage and **resistant** to extraordinary piercing damage. However, they are **susceptible** to fire damage.They save against fire at a-2 penalty and suffer double damage dice.

###### Ecology

If a galdrtré grove is encountered, there is a 5% for a galdrtré sapling to be present. Roll 1d20 for age: 1, baby, 2-20, juvenile. The grove will always be situated at an elemental place of power, sinkhole of evil, or pinnacle of good.

### Gargoyle

Gargoyles are demonic magical constructs standing about 9’ tall and weighing about 1,500 lbs. A typical gargoyle has 15’ wide bat-like wings, two large horns, huge fangs, fearsome claws, and skin the color of gray stone. Like golems, gargoyles can only be created using mighty magic by exceptionally powerful spellcasters.

Although not as physically powerful as golems, gargoyles are more intelligent. During their manufacture, a bestial cacodemon spirit is grafted into the construct that provides them with the sly cunning of a lethal predator.

That same demonic spirit instills in the gargoyle a predator’s lust for blood and flesh, a lust that the gargoyle – being a construct of stone – can never satiate.

###### Combat

A stationary gargoyle perched on a stone building is **hard to differentiate** from a grotesque statue of the ordinary sort. Creatures encountering them in such environments suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls.

In combat, gargoyles can bite with their fangs (1d6 {P!}, gore with their horns (1d4 {P!}), and rake with each of their claws (1d3 {S!}).

Gargoyles are **immune** to enchantment effects, to poisonous damage, and to all mundane damage. As constructs, they count as enchanted creatures for purposes of spells such as *dispel evil*and *holy circle*.

###### Ecology

As constructs, gargoyles have no natural habitat. They can often be found guarding ancient treasures or serving powerful spellcasters. Other times they are driven by their demonic souls to roam dungeons or wildernesses in search of prey to satisfy their insatiable hunger.

###### Spoils

A destroyed gargoyle can be harvested with Magical Engineering for the following component:

* leering head (3 1/6 st, 190gp, *deflect ordinary weapons, winged flight*)

###### Lair

A limestone wall, overgrown with ivy and moss, is all that remains of a fort that once stood here. The wall rises some 15’ high and spans about 30’ in length before it crumbles into rubble. In lieu of battlements, the ancient builders constructed a series of grotesque statues that still leer down at passersby, remarkably intact. The statues are actually **five gargoyles**.

**Gargoyles (5):** Spd 90’ / 150’ fly, AC 4, HD 4\*\*, hp 22, 20, 19, 18, 14, #AT 4 (2 claws, bite, horn 7+), Dmg 1d3 {S!} /1d3 {S!} / 1d6 {P} / 1d4 {P}, Save F8, ML +3, XP 190

Amidst the rubble at the eastern edge of the wall are a number of skeletons, slain long ago in the siege that destroyed this place. One of the skeletons wears a carved jade ring (1,000gp).

### Genie, Efreet

Genies are sapient humanoids native to the Elemental Spheres with powerful magical abilities. They are often summoned by mages to render services and sometimes bound in bottles, rings, and other items.

Genies from the Elemental Sphere of Air are called efreeti. They stand 12’ tall and have fire- or soot-colored skin, flaming eyes, and horns. Their devilish aspect and malevolent nature leads to them sometimes being confused with báleygr, but efreeti are elemental, not demonic, creatures.

Efreet speak their own language, as well as Ancient Zaharan, Classical Auran, Common, Opelenean, and Shebatean.

###### Combat

Efreeti have several **spell-like abilities**, each of which can be used thrice per day: *boil blood, burning sparks, create food, create water, create objects, invisibility, perpetual figment, wall of flame, weave fire*. All function at caster level 13.

Each use of *create objects* can create up to 10 st of objects worth up to 100gp / st. The craftsmanship in created objects is equivalent to 3 ranks of Crafting proficiency. An efreet summoned by ritual magic can create permanent objects, but one summoned by spells can only create temporary objects. These vanish when *dispelled* or the summoning ends.

As a full-round action, when near a brazier or fire, an efreet can become a 30’ tall **fiery pillar** with a 10’ diameter. When in pillar form, the djinni can move at a combat speed of 30’ over land. If the fiery pillar moves onto or through a creature, or a creature moves into or through the pillar, the creature must make a Blast saving throw. If the save fails, the creature takes 2d6 {F!} damage. If the save succeeds, the creature takes half that damage. If the fiery pillar moves onto a structure, the structure takes 2d6 {F!} structural damage. The pillar can move through creatures without penalty, but it must ends its movement if it moves onto a structure. The pillar cannot move across bodies of water. The genie can revert to its true form at the end of its initiative if desired.

All efreeti are **immune** to mundane damage and fire damage.

An efreet summoned with ritual magic can be compelled to grant up to 3 *wishes* in lieu of other services. (No effect short of ritual magic can compel or influence an efreet’s response to a *wish* in any way.) Efreeti resent being summoned, and though they must serve when properly compelled, they will attempt to twist the meaning of their orders and obey them only to the letter.

###### Ecology

In the Elemental Sphere of Fire, the efreeti dwell in great citadels of blazing bronze that orbit endlessly around spheres of fire. They appear on Aurëpos when called forth by a spell or furnace of elemental fire.

### Genie, Hafar

Genies are sapient humanoids native to the Elemental Spheres with powerful magical abilities. They are often summoned by mages to render services and sometimes bound in bottles, rings, and other items.

Genies from the Elemental Sphere of Earth are called hafari. They resemble comely 10’ tall men with stone-colored skin, iron grey eyes, bald heads, and narrow obsidian-hued beards.

Hafar speak their own language, as well as Ancient Zaharan, Classical Auran, Common, Opelenean, and Shebatean.

###### Combat

Hafari have several **spell-like abilities**, each of which can be used thrice per day: *create food, create water, create objects, earth’s movement, earth’s mire (*or *reversed earth’s hardening), earth’s tremor, invisibility, perpetual figment,* and *wall of stone*. All these abilities function at caster level 12.

Each use of *create objects* can create up to 10 st of objects worth up to 100gp / st. The craftsmanship in created objects is equivalent to 3 ranks of Crafting proficiency. An efreet summoned by ritual magic can create permanent objects, but one summoned by spells can only create temporary objects. These vanish when *dispelled* or the summoning ends.

As a full-round action, while touching the earth, a hafar can transform into a **rolling boulder** up to 24’ in diameter. When in boulder form, the hafar can move at a combat speed of 40’ over land or 20’ burrowing through earth and rock. If the boulder moves into or through one or more creatures during the move, each such creature must make a size-adjusted Paralysis saving throw. If the save fails, the creature suffers 2d6 {Se!}damage and is knocked **prone**. If the save succeeds, it suffers half that damage but is not knocked prone. If the boulder moves into contact with a structure, it deals 2d6 {Se!}structural damage. The boulder must end its movement when it contacts a structure or a creature that succeeds on its save. It can revert to its true form at the end of its initiative if desired.

All hafari are **immune** to mundane damage and seismic damage.

A hafar summoned with ritual magic can be compelled to grant up to 3 *wishes* in lieu of other services. (No effect short of ritual magic can compel or influence a hafar’s response to a *wish* in any way.) Hafar despise those who summon them and will attempt to twist the meaning of their orders and obey them only to the letter.

###### Ecology

In the Elemental Sphere of Earth, the hafari dwell in enormous cities of alabaster and porphyry that beggar the largest of dwarven vaults. They appear on Aurëpos when called forth by a spell or edifice of elemental earth.

### Genie, Jann

Genies are sapient humanoids native to the Elemental Spheres with powerful magical abilities. They are often summoned by mages to render services and sometimes bound in bottles, rings, and other items.

Genies from the Elemental Sphere of Air are called janni. They resemble 10’6” tall humans of majestic beauty dressed in resplendent finery. Jann speak their own language, as well as Ancient Zaharan, Classical Auran, Common, Opelenean, and Shebatean.

###### Combat

Janni have several **spell-like abilities**, each of which can be used thrice per day: *control wind, create food, create water, create objects, gaseous form, invisibility, perpetual figment, wall of thunder, and weave smoke*. All these abilities function at caster level 11.

Each use of *create objects* can create up to 10 st of objects worth up to 100gp / st. The craftsmanship in created objects is equivalent to 3 ranks of Crafting proficiency. An efreet summoned by ritual magic can create permanent objects, but one summoned by spells can only create temporary objects. These vanish when *dispelled* or the summoning ends.

As a full-round action, while under open skies, a jann can transform into a **thunderous whirlwind** standing 70’ tall with a 10’ diameter at its base and 20’ diameter at its apex. When in whirlwind form, the djinni can move at a combat speed of 40’ over land or water. If the whirlwind moves into contact with a creature, or a creature moves into contact with the whirlwind, the creature must make a size-adjusted Paralysis saving throw. If the save fails, the creature takes 2d6 {E!}damage and is **forced back** 10’ and knocked **prone**. If the save succeeds, the creature takes half that damage but is not forced back. If the whirlwind moves into contact with a structure, it deals 2d6 {E!} structural damage. The whirlwind can move through creatures without penalty, but ends its movement if it moves onto a structure. The genie can revert to its true form at the end of its initiative if desired.

All janni are **immune** to mundane damage and electric damage.

A jann summoned with ritual magic can be compelled to grant up to 3 *wishes* in lieu of other services*.* (No effect short of ritual magic can compel or influence a jann’s response to a *wish* in any way.) Janni are more accommodating than other genies and tend not to be malignant while fulfilling *wishes*.

###### Ecology

In the Elemental Sphere of Air, the janni dwell in aerial palaces that float in the endless sky. They appear on Aurëpos only when called forth by a spell or aerie of elemental air.

### Genie, Marid

Genies are sapient humanoids native to the Elemental Spheres with powerful magical abilities. They are often summoned by mages to render services and sometimes bound in bottles, rings, and other items.

Genies from the Elemental Sphere of Water are called marids. They stand 15’9” tall and have aquamarine complexions, grey-green eyes, and blue-tinted black hair. They dress in flowing clothing adorned with fine jewelry. Marid speak their own language, as well as Ancient Zaharan, Classical Auran, Common, Opelenean, and Shebatean.

###### Combat

Marids have several **spell-like abilities**, each of which can be used thrice per day: *capsizing wave, create food, create water, create objects, invisibility, level water, perpetual figment, water breathing, and weave water*. All these abilities function at caster level 14.

Each use of *create objects* can create up to 10 st of objects worth up to 100gp / st. The craftsmanship in created objects is equivalent to 3 ranks of Crafting proficiency. An efreet summoned by ritual magic can create permanent objects, but one summoned by spells can only create temporary objects. These vanish when *dispelled* or the summoning ends.

As a full-round action, a marid can become a **frigid wave** 24’ wide and 12’ high. When in wave form, the marid can move at a combat speed of 30’ over land and 60’ over water. If the wave moves onto or through one or more creatures during the move, each such creature must make a Blast saving throw. If the throw fails, the wave deals 3d6 {C!} damage and forces the creature contacted to make a swimming throw or begin drowning. If the wave moves onto or through one or more vessels during its move, each vessel takes 3d6 {C!} structural damage. If the vessel is a galley or longship, its captain must also make a successful Seafaring throw of 16+ (12+ if master mariner) or the vessel capsizes and begins sinking. The wave can move through creatures and vessels without penalty, but it cannot move through or damage structures. The genie can revert to its true form at the end of its initiative if desired. If the marid’s movement in wave form carried it onto land, the marid must revert to its true form at the end of its initiative.

All marids are **immune** to mundane damage and cold damage.

A marid summoned with ritual magic can be compelled to grant up to 3 *wishes* in lieu of other services. (No effect short of ritual magic can compel or influence a marid’s response to a ***wish*** in any way.) Marid are difficult to break to a spellcaster’s will, so magical items calling upon marid are rare.

###### Ecology

In the Elemental Sphere of Water, the marids dwell in underwater cities that bob and drift in the depths of an infinite ocean. They appear on Aurëpos when called forth by a spell or well of elemental water.

### Ghoul, Desert

These cannibalistic monstrosities are common to the deserts of Aurëpos. In their natural form, they appear as bestial, crouched humanoids with hyena-like features. More often, however, they appear in the form of those they have devoured.

Desert ghouls delight in feasting on the innocent, and enjoy masquerading as children and old women right up until the moment they attack. If unable to feed, desert ghouls begin to rot like the corpses they are.

###### Combat

By expending a movement action, a desert ghoul can take on the form of the last humanoid creature it has eaten. When transformed, the desert ghoul gains the exact physical qualities (including height, weight, gender, hair color, hair texture, skin color, voice, and facial features) of the new form, but not any mental characteristics, special abilities, or equipment. The desert ghoul can transform back into its natural form instantly at the start of its initiative without expending an action.

Desert ghouls’ transformations are **horrific** to witness. When a desert ghoul transforms, each creature that beholds it must make a Paralysis saving throw. If the save fails, the creature is **cowering** until the end of its next initiative and thereafter gains immunity to the effects of every ghoul’s horrific transformation for 1 turn. If the save succeeds, the creature is not affected and immediately gains immunity to the effects of every ghoul’s horrific transformation for 1 turn.

Like other ghouls, desert ghouls attack with claws and bite. Any humanoid creature that suffers the loss of 50% or more of its total hp fighting desert ghouls is infected with **ghoul fever** and will become a desert ghoul in 2d6 days. This transformation can be prevented with the divine spell *cure disease* if cast before the disease has taken full hold.

As undead, desert ghouls are immune to enchantment effects, necrotic damage, and poisonous damage. They are inherently evil for purposes of *discern evil*and *holy circle*spells. They are rebuked as ghouls.

###### Ecology

Because they can pose as ordinary men and women, desert ghouls can thrive in populated villages, towns, and cities.

###### Spoils

A destroyed desert ghoul can be harvested Healing 2 for the following components useful in magic research:

* claws (4/6 st., 40gp, *cause disease*)
* skin (4/6 st., 40gp, *adjust self, inspire horror*)

###### Lore

*Mahmoud’s fifth wife, Aliya, was as beautiful as a goddess, yet as cruel as a demoness. Though the warlock quickly grew weary of Aliya’s mockery, his marital vows could not be broken without bringing war with her father Majid. When, by kismet, Aliya was devoured by a ghūl, Mahmoud had the thing brought to his palace and by black lore enslaved it to her form forever. Thereafter, Aliya was deemed by all to be Mahmoud’s most docile, obedient, and well-fed wife*.

### Ghoul, Grave

Grave ghouls are cannibalistic undead creatures found throughout Aurëpos. Flesh-eating mockeries of their former existence, they are driven by an insatiable hunger. If unable to feed, grave ghouls begin to rot like the corpses they are.

###### Combat

Grave ghouls attack by clawing and biting their targets. Even the tiniest bite or scratch from a grave ghoul is dangerous, for they carry a horrifically virulent form of **ghoul fever**. After a ghoul completes its attack routine (including any cleaves), each humanoid it damaged that initiative must make a Paralysis saving throw to see if it has become infected. If the save succeeds, the creature is not infected. If the save fails, the creature begins to violently spasm at the end of the grave ghoul’s initiative. While spasming, the creature is considered **paralyzed**.The paralysis can be cured with *cure light injury* or *cure disease;* otherwise it subsides after 2d4 rounds. The creature remains infected and doomed to become a ghoul if not cured (see below).

Even if it avoids becoming paralyzed by the ghoul, a humanoid creature that loses 50% or more of its total hp fighting grave ghouls is automatically infected with ghoul fever.

A creature infected by a grave ghoul’s ghoul fever will become a grave ghoul in 2d6 days. This transformation can be prevented with the divine spell *cure disease* if cast before the disease has taken full hold.

As undead, grave ghouls are immune to enchantment effects, necrotic damage, and poisonous damage. They are inherently evil for purposes of *discern evil*and *holy circle*spells. They are rebuked as ghouls.

###### Ecology

Grave ghouls often haunt cemeteries, tombs, and other places of death.

###### Spoils

A destroyed grave ghoul can be harvested with Healing 2 for the following components useful in magic research:

* claws (2/6 st., 19gp, *halt humanoid, halt monster*)
* liver (2/6 st., 19gp, *cause disease*)

###### Lore

*Ghouls feast on the flesh of living creatures, and in so doing, pass on the blessing of unlife. Those who die from their sacred bite need not fear reincarnation, for their soul shall stay with their body, to rise again, and pass onward the blessing.*

* Ishme-Dagan, *The Corporium,* Vol. 2, “On the Creation of Ghouls”

### Ghoul, Marsh

These murderous undead resemble men, save that their backs are horribly hunched, their teeth jagged, and their skin clammy greenish-brown pallid hue. Marsh ghouls are as greedy in undeath as they were in life, and enjoy collecting treasures from the dead. When not hunting or eating, they can spend hours counting their gold, silver, and gems.

###### Combat

Marsh ghouls are **naturally stealthy**, and characters encountering them have a -2 penalty to avoid surprise.

They have long-fingered hands with sharp talons at the end of their fingertips, which they use to rake their targets for 1d6 slashing damage. If both claws successfully strike in one round, the marsh ghoul **strangles** its target.

The strangled creature immediately suffers an additional 2d6 bludgeoning damage. In addition, if the creature is an animal, monstrosity, or humanoid, it also begins **choking**. Thereafter, the marsh ghoul can use its combat action to automatically deal 2d6 bludgeoning damage to the choking creature each round. The choking creature cannot take any actions or speak. A creature that has been choking for 10 consecutive rounds starts **slumbering** at the end of the round.

The unfortunate creatures incapacitated by marsh ghouls are carried back to their lairs to be consumed. The creatures that survive their predations are perhaps even more unfortunate. Any humanoid creature that suffers the loss of 50% or more of its total hp to a marsh ghoul is infected with **ghoul fever** and will become a marsh ghoul in 2d6 days. This transformation can be prevented with the divine spell *cure disease* if cast before the disease has taken full hold.

As undead, marsh ghouls are immune to enchantment effects, necrotic damage, and poisonous damage. They are inherently evil for purposes of *discern evil*and *holy circle*spells. They are rebuked as ghouls.

###### Ecology

Marsh ghouls dwell in sunless cellars, graveyards, or ruins in dark bogs, fetid marshes, or forbidding swamps, emerging only to hunt for victims.

They tend to keep their victims’ bones in sacks so that they can consume the bone-marrow at their leisure. When marsh ghouls are encountered in a cellar, there will be 1d4 sacks of bones per creature.

###### Spoils

A destroyed marsh ghoul can be harvested with Healing 2 for the following components useful in magic research:

* claws (2/6 st., 20gp, *choking grip, swimming*)

### Giant, Fire

Giants are mighty creatures that compare in stature to humans as humans compare to halflings. Unlike beastmen, ogres, and trolls, which were bred by the evil alchemy of the Zaharans, giants have existed since time immemorial, and not all giants are wicked. Some giants are more or less decent, and have even assisted adventurers from time to time in his various purposes. Most, however, are as cruel as they are stupid, and delight to eat the flesh of men.

Fire giants stand 18’ tall and weigh about 4,300lb. They have soot-colored skin with red eyes and hair. They commonly wear polished arena armor of brass, bronze, copper, or dragon-skin and carry great two-handed swords or spiked morning stars.

Giants of all types share a bombastic language. Fire giants also speak Common and Meniri Dwarven.

###### Combat

In combat, fire giants can smash with their fists or with weapons. When smashing with piercing or slashing weapons, giants deliver **vicious blows** that deal an additional 4 points per smash. When smashing with bludgeoning weapons, giants can **topple and fling** large or smaller creatures with every attack (p. XX). The creature struck must make a successful size-adjusted Paralysis saving throw or be knocked prone and forced back a number of feet equal to the damage dealt. The giant can cleave if the creature fails its save against his smash.

Instead of smashing, fire giants can **hurl boulders** to a distance of 1200’, dealing 3d6 {B!} damage in a 5’ radius to the impact point. When hurling a boulder, a giant functions like a heavy ballista using the rules for Missile Attacks with Artillery (***ACKS II RR****,* p. XX). However, the giant does not need to reload, so it can throw a boulder each round if it has sufficient ammo.

All fire giants are **immune** to fire damage.

###### Ecology

Fire giants live in large structures made of volcanic rock or dense fire-hardened earth in the Meniri Mountains. When fire giants are encountered in a dungeon lair or wilderness warband, they have a 25% chance to be accompanied by trained animals. When encountered in a wilderness lair, they are always accompanied by trained creatures. If trained creatures are present in a fire giant lair, roll 1d10 to determine type and number: 1-8, 2d4 greater hellhounds; 9-10, 1d3 12-headed hydras.

Adventurers usually encounter small bands of fire giants who have made their way into civilized realms to raid and plunder. Ancient Zaharan cuneiforms speak of a fire giant castle in a volcanic caldera deep in the Meniri Mountains ruled by a mighty king. This castle, if it exists, has never been found.

### Giant, Frost

Giants are mighty creatures that compare in stature to humans as humans compare to halflings. Unlike beastmen, ogres, and trolls, which were bred by the evil alchemy of the Zaharans, giants have existed since time immemorial, and not all giants are wicked. Some giants are more or less decent, and have even assisted adventurers from time to time in his various purposes. Most, however, are as cruel as they are stupid, and delight to eat the flesh of men.

Frost giants are 17’ tall and weigh about 3,600lb. They have pale yellow or blue eyes, with white hair that can likewise be tinged with yellow or blue. They dress in thick furs of animals they have slain, and tend to fight with battle axes and spears.

Giants of all types share a bombastic language. Frost giants also speak Common and Jutting Dwarven.

###### Combat

In combat, frost giants can smash with their fists or with weapons. When smashing with piercing or slashing weapons, giants deliver **vicious blows** that deal an additional 4 points per smash. When smashing with bludgeoning weapons, giants can **topple and fling** large or smaller creatures with every attack (p. XX). The creature struck must make a successful size-adjusted Paralysis saving throw or be knocked prone and forced back a number of feet equal to the damage dealt. The giant can cleave if the creature fails its save against his smash.

Instead of smashing, frost giants can **hurl icy snowballs** to a distance of 1200’, dealing 3d6 {B!} {C!} damage in a 5’ radius to the impact point. When hurling a snowball, a giant functions like a heavy ballista using the rules for Missile Attacks with Artillery (***ACKS II RR****,* p. XX). However, the giant does not need to reload, so it can throw a boulder each round if it has sufficient ammo.

The icy conditions in which they dwell bother them not at all, for all frost giants are **immune** to cold damage.

###### Ecology

Frost giants live in frosty caverns and glacial rifts in the Jutting Mountains. When frost giants are encountered in a dungeon lair or wilderness warband, they have a 25% chance to be accompanied by trained animals. When encountered in a wilderness lair, they are always accompanied by trained creatures. If trained creatures are present in a frost giant lair, roll 1d10 to determine type and number: 1-8, 5d6 dire wolves; 9-10, 3d6 polar bears.

Adventurers usually encounter small bands of frost giants who have made their way into civilized realms to raid and plunder. Jutlandic skalds, however, sing songs of a great glacial rift ruled by a frost giant jarl or king who commands hundreds of giants and a wing of white dragons. Many great heroes have sought this fabled frost giant fortress, but none have returned.

### Giant, Hill

Giants are mighty creatures that compare in stature to humans as humans compare to halflings. Unlike beastmen, ogres, and trolls, which were bred by the evil alchemy of the Zaharans, giants have existed since time immemorial, and not all giants are wicked. Some giants are more or less decent, and have even assisted adventurers from time to time in his various purposes. Most, however, are as cruel as they are stupid, and delight to eat the flesh of men.

Hill giants stand 15’ tall and weigh about 2,450 lbs. They have skin of rust brown or tan with ruddy or black hair. They dress in animal skins and typically wield crudely-hewn clubs and spears in battle.

Giants of all types share a bombastic language. Hill giants also can speak simple words and phrases in Common.

###### Combat

In combat, hill giants can smash with their fists or with weapons. When smashing with piercing or slashing weapons, giants deliver **vicious blows** that deal an additional 4 points per smash. When smashing with bludgeoning weapons, giants can **topple and fling** large or smaller creatures with every attack (p. XX). The creature struck must make a successful size-adjusted Paralysis saving throw or be knocked prone and forced back a number of feet equal to the damage dealt. The giant can cleave if the creature fails its save against his smash.

Instead of smashing, hill giants can **hurl boulders** to a distance of 1200’, dealing 3d6 {B!} damage in a 5’ radius to the impact point. When hurling a boulder, a giant functions like a heavy ballista using the rules for Missile Attacks with Artillery (***ACKS II RR****,* p. XX). However, the giant does not need to reload, so it can throw a boulder each round if it has sufficient ammo.

###### Ecology

Hill giants live in the moors and highlands below the Jutting and Meniri Mountains. Sometimes they lair in natural caverns, others in huts or steadings of mud, wattle, or wood.

When hill giants are encountered in a dungeon lair or wilderness warband, they have a 25% chance to be accompanied by trained animals. When encountered in a wilderness lair, they are always accompanied by trained creatures. If trained creatures are present, roll 1d10 to determine type and number: 1-5, 4d6 dire wolves; 6-10, 3d6 cave bears.

Adventurers usually encounter small bands of giants who have made their way into civilized realms to raid and plunder. Rumors and tall-tales speak of colossal steadings high in the mountains filled with dozens or even hundreds of hill giants with entire clans led by great chiefs. If such a steading were to exist, it would surely be a challenge for even great heroes.

### Giant, Stone

Giants are mighty creatures that compare in stature to humans as humans compare to halflings. Unlike beastmen, ogres, and trolls, which were bred by the evil alchemy of the Zaharans, giants have existed since time immemorial, and not all giants are wicked. Some giants are more or less decent, and have even assisted adventurers from time to time in his various purposes. Most, however, are as cruel as they are stupid, and delight to eat the flesh of men.

Stone giants are 14’ tall and weigh about 3,000lb. They have stone-like complexions and iron grey eyes, with hair the color of dark stone. They dress in animal skins and favor carved clubs of granite and stalactite-like spears.

Giants of all types share a bombastic language. Stone giants also speak Common, Meniri Dwarven. If they dwell near grimlocks, morlocks, or troglodytes they will speak those tongues as well.

###### Combat

In combat, stone giants can smash with their fists or with weapons. When smashing with piercing or slashing weapons, giants deliver **vicious blows** that deal an additional 4 points per smash. When smashing with bludgeoning weapons, giants can **topple and fling** large or smaller creatures with every attack (p. XX). The creature struck must make a successful size-adjusted Paralysis saving throw or be knocked prone and forced back a number of feet equal to the damage dealt. The giant can cleave if the creature fails its save against his smash.

Instead of smashing, stone giants can **hurl boulders** to a distance of 1200’, dealing 3d6 {B!} damage in a 5’ radius to the impact point. When hurling a boulder, a stone giant functions like a heavy ballista using the rules for Missile Attacks with Artillery (***ACKS II RR****,* p. XX). However, the giant does not need to reload, so it can throw a boulder each round if it has sufficient ammo. Stone giants are the **superior rock-throwers**, so they gain a +2 attack bonus when hurling rocks.

###### Ecology

Stone giants dwell in the lower reaches of the Meniri Mountains. When stone giants are encountered in a dungeon lair or wilderness warband, they have a 25% chance to be accompanied by trained animals. When encountered in a wilderness lair, they are always accompanied by trained creatures. If trained creatures are present in a stone giant lair, roll 1d10 to determine type and number: 1-8, 5d6 cave gorillas; 9-10, 3d6 cave bears.

Adventurers usually encounter small bands of stone giants who have made their way into civilized realms to raid and plunder. From time to time, stone giants have spoken of a “king below the stone” who rules vast tribes of stone giants deep below the Meniri Mountains, but no evidence of this wild assertion has ever surfaced.

### Gnome

Gnomes are a rare breed of demi-humans believed to be the outcome of dwarven and elven crossbreeding in the distant past. Standing 3' to 3’6” tall, they are of slighter build than dwarves, though noticeably bulkier than elves. Their skin color ranges from light tan to woody brown, while their hair is fair, eyes blue, noses large, and ears pointed. They make their homes in isolated hideaways and enclaves cultivated in forested hillsides or the woody feet of mountains.

Neither as industrious as dwarves or artistic as elves, gnomes are nevertheless famous for their alchemical skill. The source of this skill, however, is hotly contested. The elves argue it is clearly due to their sylvan magical heritage, while the dwarves insist it is an outgrowth of traditional dwarven brew-craft. Gnomes are equally famous for their love of pranks, especially alchemical pranks. Many children’s fables warn of hapless victims temporarily besotted by donkeys or turned into mice after accepting “tasty cocktails” from gnomes.

Gnomes have a fierce hatred for kobolds and bitter dislike for goblins. Dwarves they treat as welcome relatives, an affection they awkwardly reciprocate. Elves see gnomes as something of a historical embarrassment, but gnomes continuously attempt to impress their aristocratic cousins.

###### Combat

Gnomes encountered outside a gnomish hideaway or enclave will be groups or gatherings of grenadiers (1st level NPCs). The grenadiers will be equipped with chain mail, shields, short swords, arbalests, and 6 vials of military oil. All of the grenadiers will be **skilled warriors** with a +1 damage bonus.

###### Ecology

Each gnome group will be led by a maester with 6 AC, 2 HD, and 11 hp. Each gnome gathering will be led by an elder maester with 7 AC, 3 HD, and 20 hp.

When gnomes are encountered in an enclave, they will be led by a grand maester with 7 AC, 5 HD, 22 hp, and a +2 damage bonus. As long as the grand maester is alive, the gnomes will gain a +2 bonus to morale rolls. The enclave will be protected by a militia (0th level troops) equal to 200% of the number of gnomish grenadiers. Gnomish militia have Spd 90’, AC 3, 1-1 HD, and ML 0. They are usually equipped with leather armor, shield, crossbow, short sword, and one flask of military oil. There is a 70% chance the enclave will be further protected by 2d4 trained giant shrews.

An enclave might also be home to various gnomish workers, noncombatants (disabled, elderly, or pregnant) and juveniles, to a maximum 850%, 850%, and 1200% of the number of warriors respectively. Workers have Spd 90’, AC 0, 1d4 hp, ML -2, and are equipped with short swords. Noncombatants and juveniles have Spd 60’, AC 0, 1 hp, ML -4, and do not fight. The grenadiers and militia will fight to the death to defend the noncombatants and juveniles.

Gnomish leaders should be assigned magic items using the ***ACKS II JJ***rules (p. XX). In addition, each will carry one random potion per HD.

### Golem, Amber

Amber golems are magical constructs made of petrified tree sap. Creating one involves the employment of mighty magic by exceptionally powerful spellcasters. During the golem’s construction, the golden stone is commonly formed into the shape of dire wolves, lions, tigers, or even yali. They are typically about the same size as the animal they resemble.

Like most constructs, amber golems have no true intelligence. The magic that animates them imbues them with just enough sapience to follow simple or standing orders from their creators.

###### Combat

When encountered, an amber golem’s reactions are always determined by its creator’s orders (even if given long, long ago).

An amber golem can automatically **discern invisible** creatures and objects within 60’ (as the spell). It can **track** as if it had three ranks of Tracking proficiency.

In combat, amber golems attack with a pair of claws and a fierce bite. If an amber golem charges a creature and successfully hits it with both claws, it immediately **pounces** onthe creature. The amber golem’s subsequent bite attack automatically hits and the creature that has been pounced on must make a successful size-adjusted Paralysis saving throw or be knocked **prone**.

Amber golems are **immune** to enchantment effects, necrotic damage, poisonous damage, and all mundane damage. As constructs, they count as enchanted creatures for purposes of spells such as *dispel evil*and *holy circle*.

###### Ecology

As constructs, amber golems have no natural habitat. They can be found guarding ancient treasures, dwarven vaults, or places of power or serving powerful spellcasters.

###### Spoils

A destroyed amber golem can be harvested with Magical Engineering for the following component:

* amber heart (37 3/6 st, 2,250gp, *discern evil, discern invisible, locate animal or plant, physical protection (all)*)

###### Lore

*To reach the entrance to the Great Temple of Aryaman in Uttar, one must climb the Stairway of the Thousand Steps. Atop this stairway, one finds the Golden Doors of the Great Temple, eternally guarded by a pair of amber lions sejant. Though they might be mistaken for mere statues, the lions are animate, and their stony gaze allows no passerby to go unnoticed, no matter how well disguised by magic. Only the Anointed of the Dawn are permitted egress to the Great Temple; I was forbidden to enter. But for the Tarkaun, the Golden doors opened, and he made sacrifice to Aryaman, whom we call Ammonar.*

### Golem, Bone

These man-sized four-armed skeletal warriors are frequently mistaken for undead, but they are actually magical constructs. Creating one involves the employment of mighty magic by exceptionally powerful spellcasters.

Like most constructs, bone golems have no true intelligence. The magic that animates them imbues them with just enough sapience to follow simple or standing orders from their creators.

###### Combat

When encountered, a bone golem’s reactions are always determined by its creator’s orders (even if given long, long ago).

Bone golems are always constructed with four arms, and each can attack with a weapon every round. Bone golems are **immune** to enchantment effects; cold, electrical, fire, necrotic, and poisonous damage; and to all mundane damage.

###### Ecology

As constructs, bone golems have no natural habitat. They can be found guarding ancient treasures, dwarven vaults, or places of power or serving powerful spellcasters.

###### Spoils

A destroyed bone golem can be harvested with Magical Engineering for the following component:

* skull (26 4/6 st, 1,600gp, *barrier of blades, energy protection (cold, electrical, fire), energy invulnerability (cold, electrical, fire),* *physical protection (all), swift sword,* armor +2)

###### Encounter

A cave mouth yawns open on a nearby hillside. The mouth’s rim is adorned with the skulls of thick-browed humanoids, yellowed and pitted with great age. Inside, the walls are carved with a sequence of ancient cave paintings involving burial of the dead, the exhumation of their bones, and a witch-doctor or shaman undertaking a religious or magical ritual over the bones. The **bone golem** created by this ritual still dwells within the cave, though it has not stirred in millennia.

**Bone golem:** Spd 120’, AC 7, HD 8\*\*, hp 42, #AT 4 (flint swords 3+), Dmg 1d6 {S!}, Save F4, ML N/A, XP 1,600

The bone golem dangles with 12 ornamental bone and scrimshaw amulets, fetishes, and charms (30gp each). On its bony brow it wears a carved jade circlet (1,000gp).

### Golem, Bronze

Bronze golems are magical constructs made of bronze with molten copper inside them. Most bronze golems are fastened to resemble giant bronze-armored warriors from archaic eras. A typical bronze golem stands 10’ tall and (being solid bronze) weighs almost 5 tons. Creating one involves the employment of mighty magic by exceptionally powerful spellcasters.

Like most constructs, bronze golems have no true intelligence. The magic that animates them imbues them with just enough sapience to follow simple or standing orders from their creators.

###### Combat

When encountered, a bronze golem’s reactions are always determined by its creator’s orders (even if given long, long ago).

In combat, bronze golems smash foes with a powerful punch or huge weapon. If armed with a huge piercing or slashing weapon, a bronze golem delivers a **vicious blow** that deal an additional 4 points per smash. If armed with a huge bludgeoning weapon, a bronze golem can **topple and fling** man-sized or smaller creatures with every attack (p. XX). The creature struck must make a successful size-adjusted Paralysis saving throw or be knocked **prone** and forced back a number of feet equal to the damage dealt. The bronze golem can cleave after a successful smash that forces back its target.

Bronze golems are **immune** to enchantment effects; fire, necrotic, and poisonous damage; and all types of mundane damage. As constructs, they count as enchanted creatures for purposes of spells such as *dispel evil*and *holy circle*.

If a bronze golem suffers piercing or slashing damage in melee, the creature that dealt the damage must make a Blast saving throw. If the save succeeds, there is no effect. If the save fails, the creature suffers 2d6 {F!} damage as some of the **molten copper** within the golem gushes over it.

###### Ecology

As constructs, bronze golems have no natural habitat. They can be found guarding ancient treasures, dwarven vaults, or places of power or serving powerful spellcasters.

###### Spoils

### Golem, Iron

Iron golems are magical constructs wrought of meteoric iron into man-like forms approximately 12’ tall and weighing almost 5 tons. Most iron golems are fastened to resemble warriors in plate armor with heavy helmets. Creating one involves the employment of mighty magic by exceptionally powerful clerics and mages.

Like most constructs, iron golems have no true intelligence. The magic that animates them imbues them with just enough sapience to follow simple or standing orders from their creators.

###### Combat

When encountered, an iron golem’s reactions are always determined by its creator’s orders (even if given long, long ago).

In combat, iron golems smash foes with a powerful punch or huge weapon. If armed with a huge piercing or slashing weapon, an iron golem delivers a **vicious blow** that deal an additional 4 points per smash.

If armed with a huge bludgeoning weapon, an iron golem can **topple and fling** man-sized or smaller creatures with every attack. The creature struck must make a successful size-adjusted Paralysis saving throw or be knocked prone and forced back a number of feet equal to the damage dealt. The iron golem can cleave after a successful smash that forces back its target.

In addition, on the first round of combat and every 7 rounds thereafter, an iron golem can breathe out a 10’ x 10’ x 10’ **cloud of poisonous gas.** Each creature within the area of effect must make a Poison saving throw or immediately die.

Iron golems are very hard to hurt. An iron golem is **immune** to enchantment effects; cold, electrical, fire, necrotic, and poisonous damage; and all mundane damage. If hit by extraordinary electrical damage, an iron golem will be **queasy** for 3 rounds but not otherwise harmed. If hit by fire damage, an iron golem will heal a number of hit points equal to the damage dealt.

As constructs, they count as enchanted creatures for purposes of spells such as *dispel evil*and *holy circle*.

###### Ecology

As constructs, iron golems have no natural habitat. They can be found guarding ancient treasures, dwarven vaults, or places of power or serving powerful spellcasters.

### Golem, Stone

Stone golems are 10’ tall magical constructs made of granite, marble, or other statuary stone, weighing around 1 ton. Most stone golems are fastened to resemble kings or lords. Creating one involves the employment of mighty magic by exceptionally powerful clerics and mages.

Like most constructs, stone golems have no true intelligence. The magic that animates them imbues them with just enough sapience to follow simple or standing orders from their creators.

###### Combat

When encountered, a stone golem’s reactions are always determined by its creator’s orders (even if given long, long ago).

In combat, stone golems smash foes with a powerful punch or large weapon. When armed with a large piercing or slashing weapon, stone golems deal **vicious blows** that inflict an additional 2 points of damage per hit. When armed with a large bludgeoning weapon, stone golems can **topple** man-sized or smaller creatures with every attack. A small or man-sized creature struck by a stone golem’s smash must make a size-adjusted Paralysis saving throw. If the save fails, the creature takes damage and is knocked **prone**. If the save succeeds, the creatures take damage but stays on its feet. The stone golem can cleave after a successful attack that topples its target.

In addition, on the first round of combat and every 5 rounds thereafter, a stone golem can breathe out a 10’ x 10’ x 10’ **cloud of heavy clogging dust.** Each creature within the area of effect must make a Poison saving throw or immediately become **queasy** for 2d6 rounds.

Stone golems are very hard to hurt. A stone golem is **immune** to enchantment effects, all mundane damage; and virtually all extraordinary damage except extraordinary seismic damage. *Disintegration, depetrification, earth’s mire,* and *earth’s hardening* have special effects:

* *Disintegration* can destroy a stone golem.
* *Depetrification* spell cannot harm a stone golem, but it automatically removes its immunity to damage until the start of the same initiative count on the following round.
* *Earth’s mire* automatically causes a stone golem to become **queasy** for 2d6 rounds.
* *Earth’s hardening* automatically restores all of a stone golem’s lost hit points.

As constructs, they count as enchanted creatures for purposes of spells such as *dispel evil*and *holy circle*.

###### Ecology

As constructs, stone golems have no natural habitat. They can be found guarding ancient treasures, dwarven vaults, or places of power or serving powerful spellcasters.

### Golem, Wood

Wood golems are 3’ to 5’ tall magical constructs made of blackwood, ironwood, hickory, oak or other hardwoods, weighing about 100 lbs. Most wood golems are shaped to resemble dwarves, gnomes, or beastmen. Creating one involves the employment of mighty magic by exceptionally powerful clerics and mages.

Like most constructs, wood golems have no true intelligence. The magic that animates them imbues them with just enough sapience to follow simple or standing orders from their creators.

###### Combat

When encountered, a wood golem’s reactions are always determined by its creator’s orders (even if given long, long ago).

In combat, wood golems smash foes with a powerful punch or a weapon. However, they are **clumsy** and suffer a -1 penalty to initiative rolls.

They are **immune** to enchantment effects; necrotic and poisonous damage; and all mundane damage except fire damage. They are **susceptible** to fire damage. They make saving throws against fire with a penalty of -2 and suffer double damage.

As constructs, they count as enchanted creatures for purposes of spells such as *dispel evil*and *holy circle*.

###### Ecology

As constructs, wood golems have no natural habitat. They can be found guarding ancient treasures, dwarven vaults, or places of power or serving powerful spellcasters.

### Goo, Grey

The horrific grey goo can grow to a diameter of up to 10’ with a thickness of about 6”. Mindless and implacable, grey goo slowly oozes through its environment to consume everything in its path. It can move along floors, walls, and ceilings with equal ease, undulate through water, and can ooze through tiny fissures in stone or narrow gaps in doorways.

###### Combat

Grey goo resembles damp stone so closely that it can be mistaken for that easily, giving it **natural stealth** when in dungeons. Creatures encountering grey goo suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls. It possesses **terrestrial mechanoreception** enabling it to sense vibration in the ground over long distances equivalent to line of sight in full daylight.

In combat, grey goo strikes like a snake, slamming opponents with its body. The effects of a successful slam depend on whether the target is armored:

* A successful slam on an unarmored being deals 2d8 {A!} damage to the creature. Any non-magical clothing is destroyed immediately as the acid eats through it viciously. Magical clothing is destroyed unless it succeeds on a Death save (use the wearer’s target value, adding any magic bonus if applicable).
* A successful slam on an armored being immediately destroys any non-magical armor. Magical armor is destroyed unless it succeeds on a Death save (as above).

If grey goo hits a creature with its slam, the goo **clings** to the creature in order to dissolve it. The goo can use its combat action to automatically deal another 2d8 {A!} damage to the creature each round. The creature to which the goo is clinging can still move, but count as carrying an extra 300 st. of encumbrance. (Most creatures won’t be able to move!) The goo moves with the creature it is latched onto. A grey goo will continue clinging to a creature until the creature dies or the goo is destroyed. Any creature reduced to 0 hp or fewer is immediately slain and its body consumed.

Grey goo is **immune** to enchantment effects and to acidic, arcane, cold, fire, luminous, necrotic, poisonous, and seismic damage. It has no resistance to electrical damage or to bludgeoning, slashing, or piercing damage. However, a non-magical weapon that strikes grey goo dissolves immediately after dealing its damage. A magical weapon dissolves unless it succeeds on a Death save (as above).

###### Ecology

Grey goo is found in dank caves and dungeons where it serves as a decomposer that eliminates organic material. It feeds on plants, animals, and metals, including weapons and armor, but does not digest stone.

A grey goo reproduces by budding, detaching a newborn grey gunk (baby) each time it consumes 3,100lbs of bone, flesh, or metal.

A destroyed gray ooze can be harvested with Alchemy for the following component:

* electrocuted remnants (1 3/6 st, 95gp, *energy invulnerability (cold, fire), rain of vitriol, slickness, vitriolic infusion, warp wood*)

### Gorgon

According to Auran myth, the first gorgon was once Ianna’s most beloved bladedancer, Madosara (“golden sword”), renowned for her blonde locks and brazen blades. Though favored in all things by her goddess, Madosara sadly succumbed to Nasga’s blandishments and pursued forbidden ecstasies. When Ianna discovered the deceit, she transformed her wayward priestess into a form befitting her monstrous deeds – that of a statuesque golden-winged woman with writhing snakes for hair, brazen nails, and tusk-like fangs on a hideous face. Gorgons have adopted Draconic as their language. They typically also speak archaic versions of the local dialects.

###### Combat

A gorgon can attack with its brazen claws for 2d6 {S!} damage and its huge fangs for 4d6 {P!} damage. If a gorgon successfully bites a creature, the creature is immediately attacked by 1d6 **writhing vipers**. Each viper attacks at 9+ for 1d4 {P!} damage. A creature damaged by one or more of the viper’s bite must make a Death saving throw, with a -1 penalty per viper after the first. If the save fails, the creature dies of poison 1d4+2 turns later.

In lieu of attacking with its claws and bite, a gorgon can direct its **petrifying gaze** in in a cone 60' long and 30' wide in front of itself. Each creature within the cone that is beholding the gorgon must make a Paralysis saving throw. If the save succeeds, the creature is not affected. If the save fails, the creature is instantly **petrified**.

Gorgons are **immune** to poisonous damage and to mundane bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.

###### Ecology

Gorgons prefer to dwell alone or in the company of others of their kind. They seem to favor ancient buildings of ruined grandeur that remind them of their lost beauty. They can have offspring with both human and elven men. All children of the union will resemble ordinary girls, but when they reach adolescence will transform into medusa over the course of 1d6 horrific days. Gorgons never raise their own children, abandoning them at orphanages or villages. New gorgons are born when a medusa lives to ancient age and metamorphizes (see p. XX).

###### Spoils

A slain gorgon can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the following components useful in magic research:

* eyes (6 4/6 st., 400gp, *petrification*)
* fangs (6 4/6 st, 400gp, *swift strike,* weapon +2)

A gorgon’s head retains its ability to petrify creatures for 10 rounds after it is severed. Storing the head in a powerful metamphora (at least 1,600gp value) can delay this deterioration for up to 3 days.

A gorgon’s 4d12 flight feathers each fetch 2d6gp and weigh 1/12 st. In addition, 1d6 doses of viper venom (125gp, 1/6 st each) can be extracted from a gorgon’s snaky hair.

### Gorilla, Cave

These omnivorous primates are sometimes called white apes because of their pale skin, pink eyes, and thick white hair covering their 6’-tall 360lbs frames. Cave gorillas have adapted to living in the underdark below Aurëpos, only venturing to the surface to forage for food at night.

Cave gorillas live in bands led by the biggest, strongest male. While they do not have a true language, they can plead, threaten, and warn other creatures with cries, screams, and gestures.

Adventurers who have explored the jungles of Ulruk claim that there are many other types of gorillas, similar to the cave gorillas of Aurëpos in characteristics, but with colors ranging from brownish-grey to silver and black.

###### Combat

Cave gorillas will roar and thump their chests at creatures they encounter, but do not typically attack unless the creature approaches their lair. Characters encountering cave gorillas away from their den gain a +1 bonus to reaction rolls. If forced to fight, they attack with their vicious claws or throw rocks.

###### Ecology

When cave gorillas are encountered in their den, the adults will be rearing 1d4-1 juvenile cave gorillas and 1d4-1 baby gorillas. Juvenile cave gorillas have AC 1, Spd 90’, 2 HD, and attack with two claws (1d2 {S}). Baby gorillas have AC 0, Spd 90’, HD 1, and attack with two scritches (1 {S}).

###### Spoils

A slain cave gorilla with exceptional attributes can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following component:

* skull (1 2/6 st, 80gp, *speak with beasts, sling stone*)

A cave gorilla's pelt fetches 50gp and weighs 1 st.

Cave gorillas themselves are easily trained if captured while young, and many races of humanoids use them as guards and servants.

###### Lore

*The cave gorilla is nowhere more prevalent than in Southern Argollë. Upon consideration, this is a most remarkable fact. Krysea, for instance, has more caves and caverns in just 500 square miles of rocky hillside than all of the Argollëan woodland. Why, then, is the cave gorilla present in such robust numbers in Southern Argollë?*

*My supposition is that the Thrassians who once dominated this region bred the cave gorillas as pets or workbeasts, and that their white hide is not a byproduct of long years in lightless caverns but rather a foul mockery of the pale-skinned elves that the Thrassians overthrew.*

* Toraster the Elder, *Bestiary of Aurëpos*

### Griffon

Griffons are powerful, majestic creatures crossbred from eagles and lions. Their forebody, front legs, head, and wings are those of a giant eagle while their hindquarters, hind legs, and tail are those of a lion. A typical griffon weighs around 825 lbs and measures 8’ long with a wingspan of 25’. Griffons are fierce carnivores with a particular taste for horse flesh.

###### Combat

Like eagles, griffons have **acute vision** and **alertness**, granting them a +2 bonus to avoid surprise in their natural habitat.

They prefer horseflesh to all other meat, and if a party encountering griffons has one or more horses, the griffons are automatically Hostile. The griffons will always attack the horses first, though they can switch targets later to defend themselves.

A flying griffon can make a **dive attack** with its talons. A dive attack inflicts double the normal damage (2d4/2d4). If the griffon hits a creature smaller than itself with both its talons while making a dive attack, the creature must make a size-adjusted Paralysis saving throw. If the save fails, the creature is **grabbed**.

###### Ecology

When griffons are encountered in their aerie, there is a 25% chance each griffon is guarding offspring. Roll 1d6f or number and age: 1-2, it’s 1d3 eggs, 3-6, it’s 1 juvenile. Juvenile griffons have AC 1, Spd 90’, HD 3+2, and attack with 2 talons (1d2 {S}) and 1 bite (1d8 {P}). They cannot fly. Griffon eggs have 1 hp and weigh 3/6 st.

The valuable offspring are not easy to claim, because griffons are intensely protective of their young. Griffons defending young do not have to make morale rolls; they always fight to the death.

###### Spoils

A slain griffon can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the following components useful in magic research:

* beak (2 3/6 st, 150gp, *sharpness, striking, sharpness, swift sword*)
* eyes (2 3/6 st, 150gp, *banner of invincibility, dominate humanoid, remove fear*
* wingtips (2 3/6 st, 150gp, *flight, winged flight*)

A griffon’s two talons each fetch 4gp and weigh 1/6 st and its 4d12 flight feathers each fetch 3d6gp and weigh 1/8 st.

Because of their fierce and predatory nature, griffons of any age can only be trained by monster whispering.

### Grimlock

Grimlocks are hideous eyeless humanoids that dwell in the lightless subterranean depths. They are virtually never seen on the surface, and few sages are even aware of their existence; of those that are, most believe that “grimlocks are to morlocks what morlocks are to men: twisted and degenerate dwellers of the underdark below.”

Only those who have plumbed the darkest of the ancient annals know the truth: The grimlocks were created as a servitor race by the khepri (see p. XX), who crossbred morlocks with various subterranean creatures. They were made eyeless so that the khepri could freely expose their true faces without driving their minions to madness. Since the destruction of the khepri kingdoms, the grimlocks have eked out a savage existence.

The Grimlock tongue is a debased dialect of Khepri. Leaders have a 10% chance per HD of knowing the language of another subterranean species, such as dwarves, morlocks, or troglodytes.

###### Combat

Grimlocks have **dull gray skin** that resembles stone. Characters encountering grimlocks in mountains or underground have a -2 penalty to surprise rolls.

Though grimlocks are **blind**, they possess **echolocation** (120’)that enable them to easily navigate the world around them.No spells or effects that would ordinarily blind a creature will affect a grimlock, but *inaudible* creatures are hidden from them, and *noiselessness* blinds them.

###### Ecology

Each grimlock gang will be led by a champion with 3 AC, 3 HD, 16 hp, and a +2 damage bonus. Each grimlock warband will be led by a sub-chieftain with 4 AC, 4 HD, 20 hp, and a +2 damage bonus. A grimlock lair or vault will be led by a chieftain with 5 AC, 6 HD, 28 hp, and a +3 damage bonus. As long as the chieftain is alive, the grimlocks will gain a +2 bonus to morale rolls. Grimlock lairs and vaults will have drudges and whelps equal to 100% and 200% of the number of warriors, respectively. Grimlock drudges fight as morlocks, while grimlock whelps have AC 0, Spd 90’, 1 hp, ML -4, and do not fight.

When grimlocks are encountered in a vault, certain additional creatures will be present. There is a 50% chance for 1d10 enslaved captives per warband. In addition, a vault has a 50% chance of a shaman being present, and a 25% chance of a witch doctor. A shaman is equivalent to sub-chieftain statistically, but has Shaman abilities at level 1d6. A witch doctor is equivalent to a champion statistically, but has Mage abilities at level 1d4. Finally, there is a 5% chance that a khepri will be present, ruling over the grimlocks.

###### Spoils

A slain grimlock can be harvested with Healing for the following component:

* ears (2/6 st, 20gp, *cause blindness, inaudibility, noiselessness*)

### Hag

Hunched, twisted humanoids of female form, hags are hideously ugly, with distorted features, long spindly arms, lank hair, and filthy talon-like nails. Although superficially human, they are inhumanly strong supernatural beings with iron-hard skin, a natural aptitude for the arcane arts, a malicious intelligence, and a hunger for man-flesh.

However, they are cunning enough to forgo such food if the opportunity to sow greater woe presents itself. While the desperate sometimes seek out their alchemical or sorcerous wisdom, the support of a hag always comes at a terrible cost that may not be apparent until much later.

Hags usually speak Ancient Thrassian, Ancient Zaharan, Classical Auran, Common, and the languages of any local beastmen or humans.

###### Combat

All hags have the abilities of **9th-level witches**, including using appropriate magical items, researching spells, brewing potions, and creating magical items. They can be of any tradition, and usually focus on enchantment and transmogrification magic in order to better ensnare victims.

Hags can also *adjust self* and *bestow curse* once per day as spell-like abilities. They prefer to appear as a beautiful maidens, the better to lure their prey into dropping its guard.

They are **immune** to all mundane damage. As enchanted creatures they can be kept at bay by *holy circle* and destroyed or driven off by *dispel evil*.

###### Ecology

Hags inhabit the forlorn and forsaken places of the world, the dismal swamps, tumble-down ruins, yawning caves, and blasted heaths. Although sometimes encountered ranging the wilds gathering ingredients or on errands of evil, they are most frequently found in their lairs in groups of three, cackling as they study or work villainy.

Hags can reproduce only by impregnation from Lawful human men, and always birth girls. Many myths describe hags demanding the seed of heroes in exchange for their assistance. The children of such unions (who are sometimes raised by the hags but more often raised by unwitting villagers or clergy) only discover their true nature at puberty, when they begin to rapidly develop magic powers and age into hideous crones.

###### Spoils

A slain hag can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the following components useful in magic research:

* eyes (10 3/6 st., 625gp, any detection effect)
* hair (10 3/6 st., 625gp, *adjust self, bewitch humanoid*)

### Halfling

Halflings are a race of diminutive and insular humanoids noted for their love of food, wealth, and comfort and their dislike of big people, strangers, and travel. Descending from human and dwarven stock, they stand about 3' tall and weigh about 40 - 50 lbs with ruddy skin, dark hair, and brown or black eyes. Among the most hirsute of the humanoid races, halflings cultivate their body hair the way dwarves cultivate their beards. Well-groomed foot hair is the mark of a halfling of fine breeding.

Halflings live in small, close-knit communities of hill burrows with big, round windows. These “halfling holes” are a compromise between a dwarven heritage that craves the security of thick earth overhead and a human bloodline clamoring for sun and space.

###### Combat

Halflings encountered outside a delving or shire will be bounders (1st level NPCs) traveling on official business. The bounders will be equipped with leather armor, shields, short swords, and slings.

The bounders will be **skilled warriors** with a +1 damage bonus. Due to **nervous watchfulness** they gain a +1 bonus to initiative and to avoid surprise. They are **naturally stealthy** and creatures encountering them suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls.

###### Ecology

Each halfling band will be led by a reeve with 2-2 HD and 7 hp. Each halfling meet will be led by a constable with 3-3 HD and 10 hp.

When halflings are encountered in a shire, they will be led by a steward with 5-5 HD, 15 hp, and a +2 damage bonus. As long as the steward is alive, the halflings will gain a +2 bonus to morale rolls. The shire will also be protected by a militia (0th level troops) equal to 200% of the number of halfling bounders. Halfling militia have Spd 60’, AC 2, 1d4 hp, and ML -1. They are usually equipped with leather armor, shield, short sword, and sling.

A shire will also be home to various halfling workers, noncombatants (adolescent, disabled, elderly, nursing, or pregnant) and juveniles, to a maximum 850%, 850%, and 1200% of the number of bounders respectively. Workers have Spd 90’, AC 0, 1d4 hp, ML -2, and are equipped with short swords. Noncombatants and juveniles have Spd 90’, AC 0, 1 hp, ML -4, and do not fight. The bounders and militia will fight to the death to defend the noncombatants and juveniles.

Halfling leaders should be assigned magic items using the ***ACKS II JJ***rules (p. XX).

###### Spoils

A slain or even captured halfling is worthless for monster components and all other purposes. They can still, however, be killed for sport.

### Harpy

According to Zaharan legend, the first harpies were born of the union of Nasga, Chthonic goddess of beauty and pain, by Ornaron, Chthonic god of the thundering skies. Harpies have the faces, breasts, arms, and abdomens of hideous women, but the wings, talons, and tail feathers of giant eagles. They stand about 6’ tall, with wings spanning 15’, and weigh 150 lbs.

Harpies typically speak Ancient Zaharan, Common, and the local beastman dialects.

###### Combat

As a full-round action, a harpy can sing an **enthralling song**.Once begun, the song continues until the start of the harpy’s next initiative or until it is slain. While a harpy is singing, each creature within earshot of it (45’ in normal environments), other than another harpy, must make a Spells saving throw at the start of its initiative. If more than one harpy is singing, the creature saves once with a -2 penalty for each additional harpy in earshot.

If the saving throw succeeds, the creature gains immunity to the effects of every harpy’s enthralling songs for 1 turn. If the saving throw fails, the creature becomes **enthralled**. On its initiative, an enthralled creature will move at combat speed towards the nearest harpy that enthralled it; if within 5’ of the harpy, or directly beneath it (if flying), the creature will remain stationary. The creature cannot take full-round actions, combat actions, or even speak, and is **vulnerable** to the harpies’ attacks.

A creature remains enthralled until the effect is dispelled, the harpy is slain, or 6 turns elapse. Harpies delight in inflicting torment on their victims, and rarely kill them outright. Only when a harpy has played with her new “toys” for 1d6 turns will she release them from suffering by killing and consuming them.

If forced to fight, harpies take to the air, attacking with their eagle talons and/or with weapons (usually shortbows or javelins) carried in their arms. Harpies instinctually know how to take advantage of vulnerable targets (as Ambushing proficiency).

###### Ecology

Harpies inhabit bleak moors, dead forests, rocky cliffs, and other desolate and barren landscapes. Harpies reproduce by parthenogenesis without need for fertilization by males. When harpies are encountered in their nest, there is a 10% chance per harpy that it will be rearing offspring. Roll 1d4 for age and number: 1, 1d4 eggs, 2-4 1d2 juveniles. Eggs have 1 hp and weigh 1/6 st.

###### Spoils

A slain harpy can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the following components useful in magic research:

* vocal cords (4/6 st, 40gp, *angelic choir, bewitch humanoid, dominate humanoid, enslave humanoid*)

### Haugbui

Risen from those slain by a draugr in its barrow, haugbui are silent, decaying corpses that somewhat resemble zombies and might be mistaken for them at first glance – with potentially disastrous results. The speed with which they move, and their gnarled, claw-like hands, give them away for what they truly are. Like their draugr masters, haugbui crave fresh flesh, and devour it greedily when opportunity permits.

###### Combat

Haugbui normally attack twice per round with their vicious claws, dealing 1d8 [S!] damage each.

Sometimes their draugr masters will equip them with weapons and shields buried in their barrow. When so equipped, they have AC 5 and one attack per round, dealing damage by weapon +2.

As undead, haugbui are immune to enchantment effects, necrotic damage, and poisonous damage. They are inherently evil for purposes of spells such as *discern evil*and *holy circle*. They are rebuked as wights.

###### Ecology

Fortunately for all living creatures, haugbui are unable to leave the barrows they arose in, and while the death of their draugr master frees them from its command, they then become little more than thoughtless predators, ready to savagely attack and feast upon any trespassers into their barrow home.

###### Spoils

A destroyed haugbui can be harvested with Healing 2 for the following components useful in magic research:

* claw-like hands (5/6 st., 50gp, *swift sword, undead legion*)
* skin (1/6 st., 15gp, *deathless minion*)

###### Encounter

Dozens of small, heavily weathered rune-stones mark an ancient burial field, 25’ feet wide and 70’ long. The stones are scribed with the names of fallen warriors from the Empyrean War. **Four haugbui** wearing the last tatters of ancient armor, prowl the burial field seeking the battlefield victory that eluded them in life.

### Haunt

Haunts are incorporeal undead condemned to linger at the place of their death. Sometimes haunts arise when sapient creatures are violently slain in sinkholes of evil, which can trap souls and prevent their transmigration to other spheres. Other times haunts are created by greater undead such as wights or specters, whose enervating touch can leave a soul too weak to pass on to the afterlife.

However it is made, a haunt looks much as it did just before its death, though it is weightless and slightly transparent. It can be easily recognized by those who knew the haunt in life, or have seen its face in paintings or statues. Whatever wounds claimed its life will always be visible on its ghostly body.

Haunts remember their prior lives dimly, as if it were a dream. Though sapient, they do not form lasting memories based on their undead existence, living in an ephemeral eternal now.

###### Combat

Every haunt is condemned to remain within 300’ of the place where it died until it is destroyed. For instance, a specter might enervate all of the residents of a hamlet, and its victims would thereafter linger as haunts in and around their hamlet.

Left undisturbed, haunts tend to re-play moments from their mortal lives, often the moment of their death. If disturbed, they will attack with their **haunting embrace**. Any creature embraced by the haunt must make a Paralysis saving throw. If the save succeeds, the creature suffers 1 {N!}damage. If the save fails the creature suffers 1 {N!} damage and is **faltering** until the end of its next initiative. However:

* If already faltering, the creature suffers 1d3 {N!} damage and is **frightened** until the end of its next initiative.
* If already frightened, the creature suffers 1d6 {N!} damage.

Haunts are **immune** to enchantment effects, necrotic damage, poisonous damage, and all mundane damage. As **incorporeal** beings, natural and non-magical weapons always deal mundane damage against them, even if the creature would otherwise deal extraordinary damage. However, silver weapons deal extraordinary damage against them.

Haunts created by violent death in a sinkhole of evil are automatically destroyed if their remains are found and cremated outside the sinkhole. Haunts created by enervation are automatically destroyed if their remains are found and cremated and the undead which created them is destroyed.

They are inherently evil for purposes of *discern evil*and *holy circle*spells and are rebuked as zombies. Rebuked haunts instantly vanish, returning only when the duration expires.

###### Ecology

Haunts can be encountered any place the chill of undeath has touched. It is not uncommon to find them haunting lonely mansions, remote lighthouses, and other places where isolated men and women might fall victim to undeath.

### Hellhawk

The monstrous hellhawk measures 25’ long from head to tail and weighs 1,500 lbs. Its wings, bat-like, with tough and leathery skin stretched between their bones, have a span of 45’. They were crossbred from cacodemons and wyverns by the ancient Zaharans as mounts for their elite ruinguards. Zahar is now a distant memory, but the soul of every hellhawk remains bound by the ancient pacts of their former masters.

Hellhawks are semi-sapient. Although incapable of true speech, they can communicate with body posture and vocalizations.

###### Combat

A hellhawk carries the **stench of rotting carrion**, its body so foul that its very life-blood pollutes and destroys the soil. Living creatures that begin their initiative, or move on their initiative to, within 20’ of a hell-hawk must make a Death saving throw become **queasy** from its overwhelming stench. The condition lasts for 1d4+4 rounds after the character leaves the hell-hawk’s vicinity. Zaharans are immune to the stench.

Once per hour, a hellhawk can utter a **despairing cry** that inflicts dread and horror on all lawful creatures within earshot (60’ in normal environments). Each creature must make a Paralysis saving throw. The effects depend on the intelligence and power of the creature and the result of their saving throw.

If the save succeeds, creatures with less than 2 HD start **faltering**, while creatures with 2 or more HD are unaffected. A creature that has already faltered becomes **paralyzed** with dread if further affected. The faltered condition ends if removed magically or if the hell hawk is destroyed or goes out of sight.

If the save fails, creatures with less than 2 HD drop their weapons and become **paralyzed** with dread, while creatures with 2 HD or more are **paralyzed** with dread until the hell hawk attacks. The paralyzed condition ends if removed magically or if the hellhawk is destroyed or goes out of sight. If a creature’s condition ends because the hell hawk goes out of sight, it must make a new saving throw against the effect when the hell hawk returns to sight. (Once a creature succeeded on its saving throw, it does not need to save again when facing that hell hawk.)

###### Ecology

When an aerie of hellhawks is encountered, there is a 25% probability that each hawk is guarding offspring. Roll 1d4 for number and age: 1-2, 1d6 eggs, 3-4 1d3 juveniles. Juvenile hellhawks have AC 4, Spd 210’, 3+3 HD, and attack with 2 talons (1d2 {S}) and 1 bite (1d8 {P}). Hellhawk eggs have 1 hp and weigh 1 st. Hellhawks fight to the death to defend their aerie.

### Hellhound, Greater

Greater hellhounds are cunning and intelligent canines that stand about 5’ tall at the shoulder and weigh about 1,350 to 1,400 lbs. Their coats are coal black while their eyes are blood red and smolder like coals. Iskara, mother of monsters, bred the greater hellhounds by infusing the ichor of efreeti pashas into the bodies of dire wolves.

Greater hellhounds are sapient creatures that are as intelligent as humans and demi-humans. They can speak the barking, baying language of hellhounds as well as the language(s) of any local beastmen and fire giants.

###### Combat

Like the wolves they were bred from, greater hellhounds have **acute hearing** and **acute olfaction.** They gain a +2 bonus to avoid surprise in their natural habitat. They can track the scent of creatures for up to 4 miles with the equivalent of two ranks of Tracking proficiency. Their keen senses enable them to **discern invisible** creatures and features within 60’.

In combat, greater hellhounds can either bite or breathe fire. The bite of a greater hellhound deals 2d6 {F!} {P!} damage. The **fiery breath** of a greater hellhound can affect one target within 15’. The affected creature must make a Blast saving throw. If the save fails, the creature suffers 7d6 {F!}damage. If the save succeeds, the creature suffers half that damage.

Greater hellhounds are **immune** to fire damage.

###### Ecology

Because of the efreeti ichor that courses through their veins, hellhounds delight in hot volcanic environments, especially places of power affiliated with the Elemental Sphere of Fire.

When greater hellhounds are encountered in a wilderness den, the hellhounds will be rearing 2d3 juveniles and 1d3 babies. Juvenile hellhounds have AC 3, Spd 90’, HD 3+2, and attack with a bite (1d3 {P}). Baby hellhounds have AC 2, Spd 90’, HD 2+1, and attack with 1 bite (1{P}). Hell hounds do not breathe fire until they reach sexual maturity.

### Hellhound, Lesser

Lesser hellhounds are cunning and vicious canines standing 3’ at the shoulder and weighing about 300 – 350 lbs. Their coats are red or red-brown while their eyes are blood red and smolder like coals. Iskara, mother of monsters, bred the first of their kind by infusing efreet ichor into the bodies of wolves.

Although not as intelligent as humans or greater hell hounds, lesser hellhounds are still sapient creatures. They can speak the barking, baying language of hellhounds as well as the language(s) of any local beastmen and fire giants.

###### Combat

Like the wolves they were bred from, lesser hellhounds have **acute hearing** and **acute olfaction.** They gain a +2 bonus to avoid surprise in their natural habitat. They can track the scent of creatures for up to 4 miles with the equivalent of two ranks of Tracking proficiency. Their keen senses enable them to **discern invisible** creatures and features within 60’.

In combat, lesser hellhounds can either bite or breathe fire. The bite of a lesser hellhound deals 1d6 {F!} {P!} damage. The **fiery breath** of a lesser hellhound can affect one target within 15’. The affected creature must make a Blast saving throw. If the save fails, the creature suffers 3d6 {F!} fire damage. If the save succeeds, the creature suffers half that damage.

Lesser hellhounds are **immune** to mundane fire damage and **resistant** to extraordinary fire damage.

###### Ecology

Because of the efreeti ichor that courses through their veins, hellhounds delight in hot volcanic environments, especially places of power affiliated with the Elemental Sphere of Fire.

When greater hell hounds are encountered in a wilderness den, the hellhounds will be rearing 2d3 juveniles and 1d3 babies. Juvenile hellhounds have AC 3, Spd 90’, HD 1+2, and attack with a bite (1d3 {P}). Baby hellhounds have AC 2, Spd 90’, HD 1, and attack with 1 bite (1 {P}). Hellhounds do not breathe fire until they reach sexual maturity.

###### Spoils

A slain lesser hellhound can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the following components useful in magic research:

* teeth (3/6 st., 35gp, *fan of flames, energy protection (fire)*)

### Herald Angel

Herald angels are powerful extraplanar entities that serve as emissaries and enforces of the Empyrean gods. Appearing as winged humans of great beauty and majesty dressed in shining armor, herald angels are fiery, forceful, and fearsome, but always just in their dealings with all beings.

Herald Angels natively speak the Empyrean tongue of the high gods. Those sent to Aurëpos as heralds will also speak the languages of the region to which they are assigned.

###### Combat

In melee, herald angels fight with **blazing two-handed swords** that deal 5d10 {L!} {S!} damage. Once per turn, the herald angel can use its sword to discharge a **blast of luminous fire** in a 60’ long and 30’ wide cone. Each creature within the area of effect must make a Blast saving throw. If the save fails, the creature suffers 13d6 {L!} damage and is **blinded** for 3d6 rounds. If the save succeeds, the creature takes half that damage and is not blinded. A herald angel’s sword melts into slag if the herald angel is dispelled or slain.

Herald angels are **potent spellcasters**, able to cast spells as 13th-level crusaders. In addition, they possess the following spell-like abilities: *cure disease*, *discern evil*, *dispel magic*, *invisibility*, *perpetual illumination*, *remove curse*, and *remove fear* (all at will); *cure serious injuries* and *fiery pillar* (thrice per day); and *restore life and limb* (once per day).

At all times, a herald angel radiates an **aura of glory** in a 30’ radius around itself. Any Lawful creature that begins its initiative in, or moves into, the aura becomes **inspired** until they start their initiative outside the aura.

Any Neutral or Chaotic creature that begins its initiative in or moves into the aura must make a Spells saving throw. If the save succeeds, the creature is immune to the aura for one day. If the save fails, the effects depend on the creature’s alignment.

* Neutral creatures become **mesmerized** by the angel until the angel attacks them or they start their initiative outside the aura.
* Chaotic creatures become **cowed** by the angel until they start their initiative outside the aura or until the angel attacks them. When the angel attacks them, they become **frightened** until they start their initiative outside the aura.

Herald angels are **immune** to luminous damage, poisonous damage, and all mundane damage. As holy beings, they can be detected with *discern good*, held at bay by *unholy circle* and destroyed with *dispel good.* If summoned, they can be dispelled by *counterspell* or *dispel magic*.

###### Ecology

Herald angels rarely appear on Aurëpos except when called forth by a spell or pinnacle of good. Sometimes, however, they are found guarding holy shrines or relics of Law.

### Herd Animal

Herd animals are grazing herbivores that roam the wilderness in herds or flocks. Region and climate will determine which specific kind of grazing herd animal is encountered.

* Small herd animals include aoudads, chamois, domestic goats, domestic sheep, gazelles, ibexes, mouflon, small deer and duikers, urials, and wild goats.
* Medium herd animals include addaxes, antelopes, argali, deer, duikers, impala, and reindeer.
* Large herd animals include bongos, domestic cattle, forest buffaloes, musk oxen, okapi, and wildebeests.
* Very large herd animals include elands, elk, savanna buffalos, water buffalos, wisents, and yaks.
* Huge herd animals include gaur and giraffes.

###### Combat

Herd animals have **acute hearing** and gain a +1 bonus to surprise rolls in their natural habitat.

25% of herd animals will be full-grown adult male with antlers or horns. Males can make butt attacks, which can deal double damage dice when used in a **charge**. Female herd animals generally lack sizeable antlers or horns, and can only make kick attacks.

As a group, herd animals are **not disposed to fight**, and as such they must make a morale roll at the end of every round.

Certain types of herd animals have additional abilities.

* **Elk/Reindeer:** These ungulates are **surefooted on snow** and retain their full speed in Snowy conditions.
* **Chamois/Goat/Ibex:** These ungulates only have a speed of 50’ / 150’ instead of 80’ / 240’. However, they can **climb** as 14th level thieves (2+). They often unintentionally mimic the sound of human screams.
* **Water Buffalo**: These ungulates are strong **swimmers** (as the proficiency).

###### Ecology

When herd animals are encountered, they will be accompanied by 2d4 juvenile herd animals and 1d4 baby herd animals. Juvenile herd animals have ½ HD, 1 HD, 1+2 HD, 2 HD, and 2+2 HD, while baby herd animals have 1 hp, 1/2 HD, 1 HD, 1+1 HD, and 1+3 HD.

###### Spoils

A slain herd animal with exceptional attributes can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following component:

* genitals (1/6 to 3 2/6 st, 10 to 200gp, *sanctuary*)

If a small herd animal has antlers or horns, they fetch 1d10sp each. Medium antlers/horns fetch 2d6sp each. Large antlers/horns fetch 1d4gp each. Very large and huge antlers/horns fetch 1d10gp each. All antlers/horns weigh 1 st per 10gp value.

A few herd animals can be valuable as workbeasts or even mounts, but most are simply used as livestock or butchered for their meat.

### Hippogriff

Hippogriffs are aggressive flying creatures crossbred from eagles and horses. Their forebody, front legs, head, and wings are those of a giant eagle while their hindquarters, hind legs, and tail are those of a horse. A typical hippogriff weighs around 1,000 lbs and measures 9' long with a wingspan of 25'. Voracious omnivores, hippogriffs have a particular taste for pegasi meat, but will hunt humanoids as readily as any other meal. As semi-sapient horse hybrids, they are much easier to train than griffons.

###### Combat

Like eagles, hippogriffs have **acute vision** and **alertness**, granting them a +2 bonus to avoid surprise in their natural habitat.

A flying hippogriff can make a **dive attack** with its talons. A dive attack inflict double the normal damage (2d6 {S}/2d6 {S}). If the hippogriff hits a creature smaller than itself with both its talons while making a dive attack, the creature must make a size-adjusted Paralysis saving throw. If the save fails, the creature is **grabbed**. Grabbed creatures are usually carried off and eaten.

###### Ecology

Hippogriffs typically nest high in the mountains. When hippogriffs are encountered in their aerie, there is a 25% chance each hippogriff is guarding offspring. Roll 1d4 for number and age: 1, it’s 1d3 eggs, 2-4 it’s 1 juvenile. Juvenile hippogriffs have AC 1, Spd 150’, HD 1+2, and attack with 2 talons (1d3 {S}) and 1 bite (1d6 {P}). They cannot fly. Hippogriff eggs have 1 hp and weigh 5/6 st.

Hippogriffs defending young do not have to make morale rolls; they always fight to the death.

###### Spoils

A slain hippogriff can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the following components useful in magic research:

* beak (4/6 st, 45gp, *sharpness, striking, swift sword*)
* wingtips (4/6 st, 45gp, *flight winged flight*)

A hippogriff’s two talons each fetch 6gp and weigh 1/6 st and its 4d12 flight feathers each fetch 3d6gp and weigh 1/8 st.

###### Encounter

Six talus caves, each ranging from 1’ - 8’ high and wide, formed by piled granite boulders, are scattered across the wooded hillside. These are the nests of **11 hippogriffs**. Hidden among the caves are **5 hippogriff eggs** and **6 hippogriff fledglings**. The hippogriffs will defend their offspring to the death.

Hippogriffs (11): Spd 180’/360’ fly, AC 4, HD 3+1, hp 15 each, #AT 3 (2 claws/bite 7+), Dmg 1d6 {S} / 1d6 {S} / 1d10 {P}, Save F2, ML 0, AL N, XP 90; Special: dive attack

Hippogriff Fledglings (6): Spd 150’, AC 1, HD 1+2, hp 6 each, #AT 3 (2 claws/bite 7+), Dmg 1d3 {S} / 1d3 {S} /1d6 {P}, Save F0, ML 0, AL N, XP 15

The hippogriffs have no treasure apart from their offspring.

### Hippopotamus, Common

The hippopotamus is an aggressive semi-aquatic mammal feared for its unpredictable temperament and powerful bite. A typical hippo weighs around 7,000 lbs and measures 12’ - 16' long from nose to rump. In Aurëpos, the behemoths are found primarily in Kemesh along the banks of the Kem River. They are widespread in the rivers and lakes of Ulrukan.

###### Combat

Hippos are aggressive and territorial. Reaction rolls when encountering them are made at a -2 penalty.

Due to their powerful jaws, hippos have **bone-breaking bites**. If the hippo succeeds on an attack throw with an unmodified 20, the creature bitten must make a Death saving throw. If the save succeeds, the creature suffers double the ordinary damage dice (6d6 {P!}). If the save fails, the creature suffers triple the ordinary damage (9d6 {P!}) and has a limb broken. Roll 1d6 to determine which limb is broken: 1-2 weapon hand, 3 weapon arm, 4-5 near leg, 6 far leg.

A broken limb has the same game effect as a missing limb (***ACKS II RR***Permanent Wounds tables, p. XX – XX) until it heals. A broken wound heals after 180 days, or 90 days under treatment of a healer.

Hippos can also attempt to **trample** their opponents. A hippo gains a +4 bonus to attack throws when attempting to trample a creature of large size or smaller. If a trample attack succeeds against such a creature, the creature must make a Paralysis saving throw. A small creature saves at -8, a man-sized creature at -6, and a large creature at -4. If the save fails, the creature takes damage, then is forced aside 10’ (to a point left or right of the hippo), landing **prone**. If the saving throw succeeds, the creature takes damage but is not forced aside. A hippo can cleave after a successful trample attack that forces aside a creature.

###### Ecology

When hippos are encountered, the adults will be accompanied by 2d8 juvenile hippos and 2d6 baby hippos. Juvenile hippos are large size, have 4 AC, Spd 75’/60’ swim, 4+1 HD, and attack by biting (1d10 {P!}) or trampling (1d10 {B!}). Juvenile hippos can only take a +4 bonus versus and force aside small creatures, which save at -4. Baby hippos are man-sized, have AC 3, Spd 75’/60’ swim, HD 2+3, and attack by biting (1d4 {P!}).

Though powerful, hippos are both dumb and surly, and as such rarely trained.

###### Spoils

A slain hippo with exceptional attributes can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following components useful in magic research:

* jawbone (18 1/3, 1000gp, *swimming,* armor +1, weapon +2)

A hippopotamus’s huge incisors fetch 18gp and weigh 2/6 st.

### Hoarflesh

The hoarflesh, the frozen dead, are born of those unfortunate souls who perish on the frozen battlefields of Jutland and Rorn. Some of those who die as the ice creeps into their bones and veins animate as these frozen undead, perfectly preserved as they were at the moment of death.

As they arise only after battles fought in frigid weather, hoarflesh are rarely seen. According to Jutlandic legend, however, in centuries past, powerful necromancers north of the Jutting Mountains assembled vast hordes of hoarflesh and marshalled them into armies of the frozen dead that terrorized their people. Some sages claim that Jutlanders invaded Dappakosea in flight from these hordes...

Hoarflesh are marked by their terribly visible wounds, the icy sheen of their pale frozen flesh, and the cold light in their eyes, and even in cold lands, the air chills at their approach. Silent, thoughtless, they crave nothing but the heat of the living.

###### Combat

Unless under another’s control, hoarflesh are automatically Hostile to any living creature they encounter.

Hoarflesh **radiate intense cold**. Any creature that starts its initiative in or moves within a 10’ radius of a hoarflesh automatically suffers 1d4 {C!} damage. The ice-taloned hands of the hoarflesh inflict 1d10 {C!} {S!} damage.

The frozen dead are **immune** to enchantment effects and to cold, necrotic, and poisonous damage. Their frozen flesh is **susceptible** to heat, however. They suffer a -2 penalty to saving throws against fire effects and suffer double damage from fire. They are inherently evil for purposes of spells such as *discern evil*and *holy circle*. Hoarflesh are rebuked as wights.

A human or demi-human slain by a hoarflesh rises after 24 hours as a hoarflesh itself unless the corpse is warmed to above freezing for at least 8 hours.

###### Ecology

Hoarflesh are usually encountered roaming the frozen wastes of northern Jutland and Rorn or lying still on the icy battlefields in which they were “born.”

###### Spoils

A destroyed hoarflesh can be harvested with Healing 2 for the following components useful in magic research:

* eyes (5/6 st., 50gp, *cone of frost, wall of frost*)
* claws (1/6 st., 10gp, *frostbite*)

### Hobgholl

A hobgholl might appear to be a hobgoblin at first glance, but these monsters are a actually a wicked, unholy magical hybrid of hobgoblin, ghoul, and troll.

Hobgholls have an affinity for the company of hobgoblins and trolls, and are occasionally employed as bodyguards to chiefs of those races. Despite their ghoulish bloodline, hobgholls are not undead.

###### Combat

Hobgholls have the same paralyzing touch as a ghoul, and can regenerate as a troll for 1 hp per round. Hit points are gained at the start of each combat round.

Hobgholls can attack with two vicious claws or with a weapon. After a hobgholl completes a claw attack routine (including any cleaves), each humanoid it successfully struck that initiative must make a Paralysis saving throw. If the save fails, the creature struck becomes **paralyzed** at the end of the hobgholl’s initiative. If the save succeeds, the creature is not affected. The paralysis can be cured with *cure light injury*. Elves, and those with an elven bloodline, are immune to the paralysis of hobgholls.

###### Ecology

Hobgholls are exclusively male. They can reproduce by copulating with either hobgoblin or troll breeders. However, the tainted bloodline of the hobgholl causes many of these unions to fail. Roll 1d6 upon childbirth: 1-2, the whelp is shriveled, ghoulish, and stillborn; 3-4, the whelp is an ordinary specimen of its mother’s race; 5-6, the whelp is a baby hobgholl.

###### Spoils

A slain hobgholl can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 2 for the following components useful in magic research:

* blood (2/6 st, 20gp, *trollblood*)
* claws (1 stone, 60gp, *halt humanoid, halt monster*)

###### Lair

A crumbling and abandoned watchtower has become the lair of a pack of **7 hobgholls**. At one time, the hobgholls had been prized bodyguards of a hobgoblin chief, but after the chief lost his throne to a rival the hobgholls were forced into exile.

**Hobgholls (7):** Spd 120’, AC 3, HD 3\*\*, hp 20, 18, 15, 15, 14, 12, 10, #AT 2 or 1 (2 claws or weapon 8+), Dmg 1d3 {S} /1d3 {S} or 1d6+1 {W}, Save F3, ML +2, XP 80; Special: paralyzing claw, regeneration

The hobgholls were able to carry off some loot when they were exiled, all of which is stored in the basement of the watchtower. The loot includes seven small sacks with 1,000sp each; a small sack with 1,000gp; and their former chief’s ceremonial headdress, dangling with scrimshaw skulls (300gp value).

### Hydra

Hydras are vicious semi-sapient monstrosities with up to 12 heads. They have skin shaded gray-brown to dark brown, with a light yellow or tan underbelly, eyes of amber, and yellow-white teeth. An average hydra is 20' long and weighs about 3,400 to 4,800 lbs, depending on its heads.

###### Combat

When a hydra is encountered, it will have 1d8+4 heads. A hydra with less than 12 heads will have cauterized stumps visible where the missing heads used to be.

Hydras have a number of Hit Die equal to their current number of heads, with maximum hit points on each Hit Die. A hydra saves as a fighter equal in level to the hydra’s Hit Dice. Each head can bite an opponent each round, so the number of attacks a hydra has each round is equal to the number of heads it has.

When a hydra suffers 8 damage, one head is destroyed. For each additional 8 damage, another head is destroyed. When all heads have been destroyed, the hydra dies. Destroying one of a hydra’s heads does not trigger a cleave.

However, a hydra’s destroyed heads can quickly **regenerate**. At the end of its next initiative, a hydra that has lost one or more heads in the preceding round will grow 2 new heads for each lost head, subject to a maximum possible 12 heads. Heads destroyed by fire damage do not regenerate. Heads destroyed by other damage can be prevented from regenerating by **cauterizing** the stumps with fire or acid before they re-grow. Cauterizing a stump is a combat action that requires a successful attack throw against the hydra at a -4 penalty to work. A character cannot cleave after cauterizing. Each cauterized stump reduces the hydra’s maximum heads.

###### Ecology

Hydra are found in bogs, marshes, swamps, and other wetlands. They are solitary creatures, always dwelling alone. They reproduce by budding: every two decades, a tubular outgrowth or “bud” begins to develop on the hydra’s body. The bud develops into a tiny version of the adult hydra with multiple tiny heads and limbs. When encountered, a hydra has a 5% chance to have a bud visibly growing on it.

After about a year, the bud detaches, becoming a hydralet (baby hydra). Hydralets quickly leave the lair to avoid being cannibalized by their parent.

###### Spoils

A slain hydra can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the following components useful in magic research:

* blood (11 4/6 st, 700gp, *cure injury, longevity, trollblood, water breathing*)
* scales (11 4/6 st, 700gp, *repair disability & disfigurement, restore life & limb*)
* set of skulls (11 4/6 st,700gp, *swift strike*)

### Hyena, Common

Hyenas are pack hunters that rove the warm shrublands of Opelenea, Kemesh, Somirea, Shebatea, and Ulruk. They typically measure 4’ – 5.5’ in length and weigh 90 to 150lbs. They have huge skulls with powerfully-built jaws set on squat, bear-like bodies with short hind legs. Their fur is typically greyish-brown or yellowish-grey with irregular spots.

Wrongly despised as cowardly scavengers, hyenas are actually cunning predators capable of taking down wildebeests.

###### Combat

Hyenas prefer to attack in packs and are more confident when their numbers are greater. If they do not outnumber their prey by at least 3:1, or if 50% of their number has been lost, their morale drops to -2.

Hyenas have incredibly powerful jaws that deliver **bone-breaking bites**. On an attack throw of an unmodified 20 , the creature bitten must make a Death saving throw. If the save succeeds, the creature suffers double the ordinary damage dice (2d8 {P}). If the save fails, the creature suffers triple the ordinary damage (3d8 {P}) and has a limb broken. Roll 1d6 to determine which limb is broken: 1-2 weapon hand, 3 weapon arm, 4-5 near leg, 6 far leg.

A broken limb has the same game effect as a missing limb (***ACKS II RR***Permanent Wounds tables, p. XX – XX) until it heals. A broken limb heals after 180 days, or 90 days under treatment of a healer.

###### Ecology

Hyenas organize themselves in large clans that can number as many as 90 animals. No more than 15-25 are typically encountered at once, however, as the hyenas are dispersed across a wide hunting range. When hyenas are encountered in their den, the adults will be rearing 1d3 juvenile hyenas and 1d2 baby hyenas. Juvenile hyenas have AC 1, Spd 120’, HD 1, and attack with 1 bite (1d3 {P}). Baby hyenas have AC 0, Spd 120’, HD 1-1, and attack with 1 bite (1 {P!}).

###### Spoils

Hyenas mark their territory with a white, gooey cream known as hyena butter that they secrete from their rectum. The foul-smelling substance is sometimes collected by alchemist and shamans, as it can be used as a miscellaneous special component for magic research. There will be 1d4gp worth of hyena butter per hyena encountered.

A slain hyena with exceptional attributes can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following component:

* jawbone (3/6 st, 35gp, *dismember,* weapon +1)

A hyena's hide fetches 12gp and weighs 2/6 st. A hyena’s fangs fetch 8gp and weigh 1/6 st.

Hyena are smart enough to be trained, but their foul temper makes it unpleasant to do so. Most trainers prefer to focus on more manageable beasts, such as war dogs.

### Hyena, Giant

These giant beasts resemble common hyenas, but measure 10’ in length and weigh 1,100lbs. Like hyenas they have oversized skulls and massive jaws on bear-like bodies. Their fur is tawny and leonine, with a prominent crest. Larger and slower than common hyenas, giant hyenas hunt alone or in small packs.

###### Combat

Giant hyenas have incredibly powerful jaws that deliver **bone-breaking bites**. On an attack throw of an unmodified 20 , the creature bitten must make a Death saving throw. If the save succeeds, the creature suffers double the ordinary damage dice (4d10 {P}). If the save fails, the creature suffers triple the ordinary damage (6d10 {P}) and has a limb broken. Roll 1d6 to determine which limb is broken: 1-2 weapon hand, 3 weapon arm, 4-5 near leg, 6 far leg.

A broken limb has the same game effect as a missing limb (***ACKS II RR***Permanent Wounds tables, p. XX – XX) until it heals. A broken wound heals after 180 days, or 90 days under treatment of a healer.

###### Ecology

When giant hyenas are encountered in their den, the adults will be rearing 1d4+1 juvenile giant hyenas and 1d2 baby giant hyenas. Juvenile giant hyenas have AC 2, Spd 90’, HD 3, and attack with 1 bite (1d10 {P} + bone-crush). Baby hyenas have AC 0, Spd 90’, HD 2, and attack with 1 bite (1d4 {P}).

###### Spoils

Like common hyenas, giant hyenas mark their territory with a white, gooey cream known as hyena butter that they secrete from their rectum. The foul-smelling substance is sometimes collected by alchemist and shamans, as it can be used as a miscellaneous special component for magic research. There will be 2d6gp worth of hyena butter per hyena encountered.

A slain giant hyena can be harvested for the following component:

* jawbone (6 2/6 st, 380gp, *dismember, slicing blow,* +2 weapon)

A giant hyena's hide fetches 105gp and weighs 2 5/6 st. Its fangs fetch 20gp and weigh 2/6 st.

###### Lore

*On my second night in the Besheradi badlands, I was awakened from my slumber by a sudden cacophony of high-pitched giggles and hysterical chuckles By the time I had roused myself enough to investigate, our guide Munatas had already armed the sentries into a formidable phalanx of bright torches and readied crossbows. In the darkness beyond the torch line I saw the shadows of great beasts, but our show of strength must have been enough, for the beasts came no closer. Soon the cackling laughter faded into the distance.*

*When daylight came, Munatas took me to the borders of the camp, and showed me the foul-smelling buttery cream that the creatures - giant hyenas, he explained – had deposited to mark their territory against our intrusion.*

### Invisible Stalker

Invisible stalkers are incarnations from the Elemental Sphere of Air. They rarely appear on Aurëpos, save when summoned by powerful mages to serve them.

Compelled by magic, a summoned invisible stalker will undertake whatever task its summoner commands, even if it sends it hundreds or thousands of miles away. Like most incarnations, of course, invisible stalkers resent protracted missions or complex tasks and will seek to pervert their instructions to ease the burden of service.

###### Combat

Invisible stalkers are naturally **invisible.** They can act freely, including attacking, without becoming visible. However, the spell *discern invisibility* will reveal its presence.

They are **proficient searchers**, capable of finding hidden features as 8th level thieves (9+) and can **track** with great skill (3 ranks).

Thrice per day, they can use *passageway* as a **spell-like ability** to pass through walls and other structures. No mere physical obstacle can stop an invisible stalker from pursuing its mission!

However, as incarnations, invisible stalkers can be held at bay by *holy circle* anddispelled with *counterspell* or *dispel magic.*

###### Ecology

Invisible stalkers appear on Aurëpos when called forth by a spell or aerie of elemental air. Nothing is known of their habitat on the Elemental Sphere of Air.

###### Spoils

A destroyed invisible stalker can be harvested with Alchemy 2 for the following component:

* clear ichor (18 2/6 st, 1,100gp, *invisibility, locate object, passageway, undetectability*)

###### Lore

*Behind three walls, the sheik sits uneasy; behind four walls, the sheik reigns secure.*

* Besheradi proverb

*By the grace of Imran, King Nassim survived the attack on his life by the cultists of Dirgion; but thereafter he lived in fear that the assassins would come again. So terrified of threats to his life grew Nassim that he commanded the construction of a grand citadel to secure his person. When it was finished, Nassim’s citadel boasted three imposing walls, each stronger and higher than the last, and each secured by a mighty gate. Atop the walls and gatehouses were stationed guards day and night, and neither man nor beast was permitted to pass into the inner circuit of the citadel without being thrice inspected. Yet King Nassim’s works were to no avail. A year and a day after his citadel was completed, the king was found dead in his bedchamber, slain by a single blow to the head. The assassin was never found.*

### Jackal, Common

Jackals are opportunistic wolf-like canines renowned for their adaptability and cunning throughout southern Aurëpos and northern Ulruk. They both hunt for small game and scavenge the carcasses of larger kills. Common jackals are 4’ long and 2’ tall at the shoulder and weigh about 30 lbs.

Jackals are trainable, though not so much as dogs or wolves. Because of their small size, they are not as useful as either. Trained jackals are somewhat popular among the nobility of Kemesh and Opelenea, who delight in seeing the creatures chase and slay vulnerable prey or devour the carcasses of slain foes.

###### Combat

Common jackals have **acute hearing** and **acute olfaction.** They gain a +2 bonus to avoid surprise in their natural habitat. They can track the scent of creatures for up to 4 miles with the equivalent of two ranks of Tracking proficiency.

###### Ecology

Each pack of ordinary jackals will be led by chief (who fights as a hunting dog). When ordinary jackals are encountered in their den, the adults will be rearing 1d6 puppies. Roll 1d6 for age and number: 1-4, it’s 1d2+1 juveniles, 5-6 it’s 1d4+2 babies. Juveniles have AC 0, Spd 150’, HD 1d4 hp, and attack with 1 bite (1d2 {P}). Baby jackals have AC -1, Spd 150’, 1 hp, ML -4, and do not fight.

###### Spoils

A slain jackal with exceptional attributes can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following components:

* fangs (1/6 st, 5gp, *swift strike*)

A jackal’s pelt fetches 1gp and weighs 1/6 st.

Jackals are as intelligent as dogs, but harder to train. Few animal trainers see much advantage in spending time on them.

###### Lair

A dense grove of acacia trees is home to a pack of **four jackals** – the pack leader, his mate, and his two adult offspring. The cunning canines have excavated a shallow den beneath the thorniest acacia, using the dense foliage as a canopy to shield a litter of **six baby jackal pups** from hungry predators and harsh sunlight. The entrance to the den is concealed by scattered brush and the den itself is lined with a soft bedding of dried grasses, leaves, and the occasional feather, providing a warm and comfortable nest for the puppies.

**Jackal pack leader:** Spd 180’, AC 2, HD 1+1, hp 7, #AT 1 (bite 9+), Dmg 1d4 {P}, Save F1, ML 0, AL N, XP 15

**Jackals (3):** Spd 180’, AC 2, HD 1-1, hp 5, 3, 2, #AT 1 (bite 11+), Dmg 1d4 {P}, Save F0, ML -2, AL N, XP 5

**Baby jackal pups (6):** Spd 150’, AC -1, 1 hp, Save F0, ML -4, AL N, XP 0

### Jellyfish, Giant

The giant jellyfish has a bell-shaped body some 7’ in diameter with a maw-like mouth on the underside surrounded by thousands of hair-like tentacles festering with venomous stingers. The tentacles trail behind the jellyfish to a colossal length of up to 120’. Despite its length, the jellyfish weighs only about 800 lbs.

###### Combat

Giant jellyfish have **translucent bodies** that make them hard to spot. Creatures encountering them suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls. The creatures “see” by means of light-sensitive eye spots spread across their bodies, equivalent to **lightless vision**.

On its initiative, a jellyfish will use a full-round action to drift above the nearest visible prey. As it moves, its tentacles trail behind it to form a watery column 7’ in diameter and 120’ long. Any creature that starts its initiative in the tentacle column, or enters the tentacle column on its initiative, is **engulfed.**

When it becomes engulfed, and at the start of its initiative thereafter while it remains engulfed, the engulfed creature must make a Paralysis saving throw. If the saving throw succeeds, the creature suffers 1 {A} damage but is otherwise not harmed. If the saving throw fails, the creature suffers 1 {A} damage and becomes **paralyzed** by the venom until the start of its next initiative. If the creature is unable to breath water, it also begins **drowning**.

If a jellyfish has engulfed and paralyzed one or more tiny creatures, it can consume the creatures as a full-round action. Consumed creatures are instantly slain.

Giant jellyfish are **immune** to enchantment effects and poisonous damage. An attack targeting a jellyfish’s column of tentacles, rather than its body, can never deal more than 1 damage to the jellyfish unless the attack has an area of effect. An attack targeting its body deals normal damage.

###### Ecology

Giant jellyfish ceaselessly drift through the ocean depths, consuming whatever hapless sea creatures are stunned by its venom. They do not establish nests or exhibit any parental care for their offspring. They rely on pelagic spawning, in which the female releases her eggs into the water column and the male externally fertilizes them. The eggs then hatch into larva (babies), which attach themselves to substrates and become polyps (juveniles), which bud to create more of their own kind. The polyps resemble sessile anemones and corals and do not become recognizable as jellyfish until they reach sexual maturity.

Since jellyfish drifty without ever nesting, the lair roll actually determines whether the jellyfish swims alone or in a bloom of other jellyfish. If a vessel encounters a bloom of giant jellyfish, all fishing attempts automatically fail until the next day, as the edible fish have been devoured or driven off by the jellyfish.

### Khepri

In the crumbling pyramids of Kemesh and other ruins predating the Day Without Night can be found curious carvings and frescoes depicting the worship of a being called the Khepri. Always depicted as a dark-skinned human with a scarab beetle as a head, the Khepri is believed to have been a god, an avatar of one of the Chthonic deities. The truth is more terrifying: The khepri was not a god; *they* were a race, the dominant race in Aurëpos in the era before man, their dark rule contested only by their eternal foes, the faravahar (see p. XX). Few khepri survived the devastation of the Day Without Night. Most of the survivors slumber in hidden vaults in remote places. The few khepri that have been roused to action have been great and malevolent actors in Aurëposean history, often serving as prophets and teachers of Chthonic beliefs in order to lay the groundwork for the Awakening.

The legend of the beetle-headed god arises from the alien appearance of the creatures. A khepri’s torso and limbs resemble those of a tall and muscular jet-black humanoid, but its head is protected by a smooth, shiny black carapace. A crown of chitin extends from the brow of this carapace, while three long mandibular appendages extend like legs from either side of it, the whole resembling a beetle’s body. But it is not. The front portion of the khepri’s carapace consists of segmented plates that can be opened to reveal an utterly inhuman face within, upon which countless khepri larvae squirm and writhe.

Khepri speak their own language, an ancient tongue related to Ancient Zaharan. They typically also speak several other languages. Because of their superhuman intellect, khepri tend to quickly learn the local dialects and languages of their area.

###### Combat

Khepri hegemony was founded on the race’s mental powers. All khepri have the ability to use each of the following spell-like abilities at will: *body equilibrium* (like *water walking*, but extending to all loose or unstable surfaces, such as sand), *clairaudience*, *clairvoyance*, *choking grip*, *discern invisible*, *levitation*, and *telepathy***.** Khepri can also *bewitch monster*once per day.

A khepri can open and close its head carapace as a movement action. A khepri’s true face is a **horrifying visage**. Immediately after the carapace is opened, and at the start of each round thereafter until the carapace is closed, each creature beholding the khepri’s true face must make a Paralysis saving throw. The save suffers a -1 penalty per additional khepri after the first. If the save fails, the creature is **cowering** until the start of the next round. If the save succeeds, the creature gains immunity to the effects of every khepri’s horrific visage for 1 turn.

As a combat action, a khepri can **kiss** an adjacent cowering, helpless, or vulnerable humanoid creature. If the kiss hits, the khepri’s larvae leap onto the unfortunate victim’s face, burrow into his skull via his mouth, nose, and ears, and make their way to his brain. At the end of its next initiative, the victim must make a Death saving throw. If the saving throw fails, the victim dies from shock. If the saving throw succeeds, the victim survives but is **enslaved** to the khepri.

The larvae can be destroyed (before or after the saving throw) by casting a *cure disease*spell on the victim. Destroying the larvae frees an enslaved victim, but does not revive a slain one. An enslaved victim is also freed if the khepri who kissed him is slain. If the larvae are not destroyed, they will grow inside the victim, feeding on his essence. After 2d4 weeks, the victim will slip into a state of unconsciousness, during which the engorged larvae will weave a cocoon around its head. 72 hours later, the victim must make another Death saving throw. If the save fails, the victim dies. If the save succeeds, the victim will awaken to his new life… as one of the khepri. Once the victim has fallen unconscious, no magic can save him except a *wish*or *miracle*. Death is usually the kinder alternative.

###### Ecology

Khepri are usually solitary creatures, but from time to time hapless adventurers will stumble upon one of the ancient vaults the khepri built to survive the Day Without Night.

A khepri vault will be led by a hierarch with 11 (or more) Hit Dice. Khepri hierarchs can use the following additional abilities: *phantasmal horror*, *scry*with *clairaudience*, *strength of mind*, and *weakness of mind*once per day; *adjust self*and *arcane shift*thrice per day; and *telekinesis* at will. They are also capable of brewing potions, creating constructs, creating crossbreeds, and performing necromancy as mages of their HD, and can collect divine power and perform blood sacrifices as chaotic clerics of their HD. Hierarchs sometimes use their ability to *adjust self*to infiltrate human society in furtherance of some Chaotic end.

###### Spoils

A slain khepri can be harvested for the following components useful in magic research:

* brain (5 5/6 st., 350gp, *greater clairaudience, greater clairvoyance, telepathy*)
* chitinous crown (5 5/6 st., 350gp, *bewitch monster*)
* facial ovipositors (5 5/6 st., 350gp, *cone of fear, frighten humanoid, halt humanoid, panic*)
* embryonic larvae (5 5/6 st., 350gp, *cause disease, enslave humanoid*)
* mandibles (5 5/6 st., 350gp, *soul eating*)
* spinal fluid (5 5/6 st., 350gp,*shimmer, levitation, water walking*)

A slain khepri hierarch is even more valuable. Each component fetches 830gp and weighs 13 5/6 st.

### Kraken

Kraken were created by Lammala, the chthonic goddess of the abyssal depths, in time immemorial. The scourge of the deep, kraken are squid of truly colossal size. Their bodies and mantles reach lengths of 60’, with their cruelly-barbed tentacles, 2 large and 8 smaller, double this length. They weigh as much as 10,000 lbs (5 tons).

These monstrous beasts take cephalopod intellect to its animal extreme, and while not fully sapient, are nonetheless cunning predators, and will freely attack and devour smaller whales, sharks, giant squids, and other oceanic denizens, as well as boats, sometimes snatching unsuspecting sailors from atop the decks of their vessels.

Some adventurers claim there are kraken lurking in the oceans that have achieved true sapience and serve as cephalopodic tyrants over lesser aquatic creatures. The most learned sages of the Tower of Knowledge consider this unlikely, however.

###### Combat

Krakens have **acute vision** and **acute olfaction** granting them a +2 bonus to avoid surprise in their native habitat. Their fluid-filled statocysts grant them **aquatic mechanoreception** that enables them to “see” underwater to a range of 270’ (p. XX).

A kraken can attack from up to 90’ away with its tentacles. A kraken’s large tentacles can attack vessels or creatures of huge size or larger. Its smaller tentacles can attack vessels or creatures of any size within reach. As a colossal creature, a kraken deals full structural damage to vessels.

A successful hit with a large tentacle deals 2d20 {B!} damage and **restrains** the creature or vessel. A successful hit with a small tentacles deals 2d12 {B!} damage and, if it struck a creature, **restrains** the creature. Small tentacles cannot restrain vessels.

While a creature or vessel is restrained by a large tentacle, the kraken can automatically deal 2d20 {B!} (large tentacle) or 2d12 {B!} (small tentacle) on its initiative each round to the restrained vessel or creature without having to make an attack throw. Doing so counts as the kraken’s attack with that tentacle.

A restrained creature cannot move but can still attack, cast spells, take actions in lieu of attacking, or attempt to escape. A restrained vessel cannot move, ram, or steer, but any crew can continue to act normally. A creature can escape by breaking free, slipping free, or cutting off the tentacle, but a vessel can only escape from restraint if the tentacle(s) restraining it are cut off. The normal rules of the restrained condition (p. XX) otherwise apply.

To cut off a large tentacle, an attack must deal 50 or more slashing damage to it in one blow. To cut off a small tentacle, an attack must deal 30 or more slashing damage to it in one blow. Any damage dealt beyond the required amount is not dealt to the kraken (the tentacle was severed).

In addition to attacking with its tentacles, a kraken can also attack with its great beak for 3d20 {P!} damage. If it is restraining a vessel, it can attack the vessel. Otherwise, it can attack a creature that is within 5’ of its beak.

If a kraken succeeds on a bite attack against a creature of huge size or less with an unmodified throw of 18 - 20, it can **swallow** the creature. The swallowed creature suffers 3d20 {A!} damage at the start of its initiative each round and drowns after 10 rounds. If the swallowed creature has a tiny, small, or natural piercing or slashing weapon, it can attack the kraken from inside its belly with an attack penalty of -4.

Should a swallowed creature die and remain in the kraken’s belly for 6 turns, it is irrecoverably digested. The kraken can cleave after swallowing a creature.

Once per day, a kraken can use its combat action to create a 180' radius **cloud of black ink** around itself. It typically uses this to obscure itself long enough to flee from a losing encounter. The ink has the effect of a *tenebrosity* spell but it disperses into the water after 1 turn.

###### Ecology

Kraken roam the oceans in search of prey, for their great bulk demands they feed constantly. They make their lairs in the abyssal depths, often near coral reefs, shipwrecks, or other underwater structures where they can lurk unseen and, more importantly, deposit their eggs in hidden places.

They reproduce only once in their lifetime and intensively care for their offspring. The female deposits a gelatinous egg mass in a hidden place, and then stays with the mass until the eggs hatch. When a kraken is encountered in its lair, there is a 15% chance it will be guarding one egg mass. Giant kraken egg masses have 5 hp and weigh 25 st.

###### Spoils

Because of their propensity to swallow creatures whole, an encounter with a kraken may yield treasure even if the creature is encountered outside its lair. Such treasure (if any) is found inside the creatures’ bellies.

A slain kraken can be harvested with Animal Husbandry or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the following components useful in magic research:

* beak (66 4/6 st., 4000gp, *circle of agony,* weapon +5)
* ink sac (66 4/6 st., 4000gp, *shrouding fog, tenebrosity*)
* small tentacle (66 4/6 st., 4000gp, *choking grip, sunder structure*)
* large tentacle (70 5/6 st., 4250gp, *cataclysm,* any water elemental effect)

If not used for magic research, a kraken’s beak fetches 60gp and weighs 1 st. A kraken’s ink sac fetches 3,600gp and weighs 4 st.

###### Encounter

For leagues, the sea has been aquamarine green, the shallow water the color of the sea floor below. Ahead, however, lies a great disk of midnight blue water, almost 1000’ wide – a giant submarine sinkhole where the sea floor falls away into a chasm more than 700’ deep.

A successful Loremastery or Knowledge (history) proficiency throw recalls that the *Leontophoros*, a Nicean royal galley, is reputed to have sunk in a “great blue hole in the sea” in this stretch of waters.

The treasure-filled wreck of the *Leontophoros* does rest at the floor of the sinkhole, alongside scores of other shipwrecks. All of these vessels were sunk by the immense **kraken** which lairs on the bottom of the blue hole. The kraken will attack any ships which sail across the blue hole, or which linger at its perimeter.

**Kraken:** Con 16; Spd 180’ swim, AC 3, HD 36\*\*, hp 220, #AT 9 (2 large tentacles, 8 small tentacles, 1 bite -10+), Dmg 2d20 {B!} + restraint / 2d12 {B!} + restraint /3d20 {P!} + swallow whole, Save F15, ML 0, AL N, XP 18,350; Special: restrain creatures (2d12 ongoing, deal 30hp in one blow to cut off), restrain ships (2d20 shp ongoing, deal 50 hp in one blow to cut off), swallow whole (target swallowed if attack throw beats target value by 4+ or on unmodified 20, suffers 3d20 ongoing, may attack from within at -4, drowns in 10 rounds)

If the kraken is slain or driven off, the treasures on the sea-floor can be dredged to the surface. A large oak treasure chest holds 5,000sp and 2,000gp in algae-covered Nicean coinage. A rusted iron box contains a pair of carnelians (75gp each), a topaz (500gp), a sunset amethyst (750gp), a pair of facet-cut star sapphires (6,000gp each), and a trio of flawless facet-cut jacinth stones (8,000gp each). A toppled cabinet in the *Leontophoros*’ forecastleholds a gold pendant embossed with a medusa’s head (700gp), an ornate eagle cameo carved of two-layered onyx (1,000gp), an intricately wrought gold wreath (1,200gp), and a gold diadem studded with diamonds topped with a winged sun of ruby and platinum (31,000gp). (The remnants of other treasures are visible throughout the wreckage, but have been irreparably ruined by algae and salt water.) The kraken’s small tentacles (4,000gp, 66 4/6 st), large tentacles (4,250gp, 70 5/6 st), ink sac (4,000gp, 66 4/6 st), and stomach (4,000gp, 66 4/6 st) are valuable as special components.

The blue hole within which the kraken dwells is an *azure well of elemental water.* Spellcasters who cast water spells here calculate the spell effects as if they were two class levels higher than their actual level of experience. Characters performing magical research related to water spells in an azure well gain a +1 bonus to their magic research throws. If the azure wall is unoccupied, there is a 10% chance every 1d12 days that a water elemental (1 elemental or 1 marid) will manifest there.

### Lamia

Lamia are monstrous sorceresses with the torso, arms, and heads of beautiful women, the lower bodies of beasts, and the tails of serpents. They measure about 8’ long and 7’ tall and weigh about 1,500 lbs.

According to Zaharan myth, the first lamia was a priestess of Nasga who displeased the goddess of pain and beauty by becoming a mother without her permission. To punish her wayward cultist, Nasga forced her to devour her own infant, thereafter transforming her into a monstrosity that hungers for the flesh of the young. Even today, lamia delight in nothing more than devouring children.

As intelligent as human beings, lamia can speak Ancient Zaharan, Common, Elvish, and the dialect of any local beastmen.

###### Combat

Though a lamia is powerful and dangerous in close combat, it has no stomach for a fair fight, preferring to use its spell-like abilities to befuddle, bewitch, and deceive its prey. At will, a lamia can use *perpetual figment*, *spectral figment,* and *word of command*. Once per day, it can use *bewitch humanoid* and *illusory duplicates*.

If forced to fight, a lamia can attack with a weapon (often a composite bow or spear) or with its serpentine tail. The tail deals 1d6 {B!} damage and any creature damaged by it is drained of 1 point of WIL permanently. When a creature reaches WIL 3, it becomes permanently **enslaved** to the lamia. No magic short of *miracle* or *wish* can restore WIL lost to a lamia’s scaly touch or free a creature enslaved to it.

###### Ecology

Lamia are often found in ruins or labyrinths, waiting for unsuspecting adventurers. They reproduce but rarely, in congress with human men they have enslaved into their service. Such children, always female, are reared far from the lamia, for the creatures would devour their own offspring as readily as another’s. The young lamia’s true nature does not reveal itself until the child reaches adolescence and undergoes a horrific metamorphosis.

###### Spoils

A slain lamia can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the following components useful in magic research:

* fingers (11 4/6 st, 700gp, *enslave humanoid, madness of crowds, weakness of mind*)

### Lammasu

The lammasu were fashioned from the spirits of heroes and saints by the Empyrean gods to serve Law. They have the forequarters of lions, the hindquarters of bulls, the wings of giant eagles, and the faces of men. They measure about 8’ long, weigh 500 lbs, and have wings that span 24’.

Lammasu natively speak the Empyrean tongue of the high gods. Those sent to Aurëpos will also speak the languages of the region to which they are assigned to provide aid.

###### Combat

If a lammasu observes a chaotic creature attacking a lawful creature, the lammasu automatically becomes Hostile to the chaotic creature and enters combat against it.

A lammasu can attack with its razor-sharp lion claws for 2d6 {S!} damage. Often, however, it will employ magic. A lammasu can **cast divine spells** as a 7th-level crusaders. Lammasu are **gifted healers** and cure twice the normal amount of hit points when casting healing spells.

Lammasu constantly radiate a **perpetual holy circle**in a 10’ radius. In addition to keeping out enchanted creatures, the holy circle grants twice the AC and saving throw bonus of the normal spell to creatures in its area (e.g. +2 instead of +1).

By virtue of their divine blessings, lammasu enjoy **magic resistance** to spells and spell-like effects. When a lammasu is affected by a spell or spell-like effect, it can (but does not have to) make a magic resistance throw. If the result of the throw equals or exceeds the caster level of the spell or spell-like effect, the lammasu ignores it.

Lammasu are holy beings that can be detected with *discern good*, held at bay by *unholy circle* and destroyed with *dispel good.* If summoned, they can be returned to their home sphere by *counterspell* or *dispel magic*.

###### Ecology

Lammasu can be found roaming throughout Aurëpos in service to Law. Often they serve as guardians of shrines, temples, or pinnacles of good. They are born only in the Sphere of Empyrean Heaven, to which their souls return on death.

###### Spoils

A slain lammasu can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the following components useful in magic research:

* blood (155 st., 9,300gp, *angelic aura, cure injury, healing circle, spirit of healing, sunflare*)
* heart (155 st., 9,300gp, any protection effect)

### Leech, Giant

Giant leeches are parasitic segmented worms measuring 4' long and weighing as much as 215 lbs. Brown, slimy, and repulsive, they live exclusively in marshy terrain and other bodies of stagnant water. Giant leeches are nearly mindless and exist only to feed and reproduce. A full-grown leech can suck a man dry of blood within less than a minute.

###### Combat

Small hair-like sensilla distributed across a giant leech’s body grant it **aquatic mechanoreception**. The leech can sense changes in water current and water pressure to a range of 60’. Spells or effects that would ordinarily cause *blindness* do not affect a monster using aquatic mechanoreception. However, creatures that are not in the water are invisible to them. Aquatic mechanoreception does not penetrate structures or terrain features.

When a giant leech senses a living creature in range, it attacks with its proboscis for 3d6 {P!} damage. If the leech damages the target with its proboscis, the leech latches onto the target and begins **drinking blood**. Once latched on, the leach can use its combat action to automatically deal another 3d6 {N!} damage to the creature each round.

Creatures that are having their blood drunk by a leech can still move, but count as carrying an extra 21 stone of encumbrance. The giant leech moves with the creature it is latched onto. A giant leech will remain attached to a target until the target dies or the leach is killed.

###### Ecology

Giant leeches are hermaphroditic and can either self-fertilize or engage in reciprocal fertilization with another giant leech. In either case, the giant leech will wrap its eggs in a cocoon, which they carry on their bodies until the eggs hatch.

When giant leeches are encountered, there is a 20% chance per leech that it will be carrying a cocoon of 1d4 eggs. The eggs have 1 hp and weight 1/60 st. Leech larvae immediately disperse into the wild after they emerge from their eggs.

###### Spoils

A slain giant leech can be harvested with Animal Husbandry 2 for the following components useful in magic research:

* sucker (6 4/6 st, 400gp, *cause injury, life transfer*)
* salivary gland (4 3/6 st, 270gp, *cure injury, salving rest*)

### Leyak

Born from a Somirean cult of wicked sorceresses whose attempt to gain immortality went awry, leyak appear as nothing more than normal human women during the hours of daylight—but when night falls, they can detach their heads from their bodies and take to the air, glistening entrails trailing from the neck and eyes glowing green. While the hollow body lies prostrate, the leyak prowls the night in search of nourishment. They prefer the flesh and blood of infants and children, but will settle for older prey or even corpses if fresher provender is unavailable or too dangerous to obtain.

Clever and patient, they will bide their time and avoid fair confrontations, and strive to avoid discovery. They are keenly aware that if their headless and helpless body is slain or if they fail to re-join by daybreak, they will die.

When a woman becomes a leyak, she loses the ability to birth children. To increase their numbers, the leyak actively seek out promising evil sorceresses to join their ranks, offering them endless youth and terrible power. Those who agree are transformed into leyak in a foul ritual involving the ingestion of leyak flesh and blood.

Leyak speak whatever languages they knew in life.

###### Combat

Every leyak retains the **spellcasting** abilities she possessed as a mortal sorceress. Most leyak are 6th level mages but some ancient leyak are even some are older and more powerful.

As flying heads, leyak have a **horrific** **visage**. When a creature first beholds one or more leyaks, and at the start of each round thereafter that it continues to do so, the creature must make a Paralysis saving throw. The save suffers a -1 penalty per additional leyak after the first. If the save fails, the creature is **cowering** until the start of the next round. If the save succeeds, the creature gains immunity to the effects of every leyak’s horrific visage for 1 turn.

A leyak attacks by lashing out with a long proboscis-like tongue. If a leyak damages a target with its bite, the leyak latches onto it and begins **draining blood**. Thereafter the leyak can use its combat action to automatically deal another 1d4 necrotic damage to the creature each round.

Creatures that are having their blood drained by a leyak can still move, but count as carrying 2 extra stone of encumbrance. The leyak moves with the creature from which it is drinking blood. A creature can only escape or be freed from the leyak by killing the leyak or severing the tongue.

To cut the tongue, a creature must deal 8 or more slashing damage to it in one blow. (Any damage dealt beyond 8 points is not dealt to the leyak.) If the tongue is severed, the leyak can no longer make tongue attacks that night, but it will regenerate the tongue by the following eve.

Despite being ageless blood-drinking fiends, leyak are monstrosities, not undead. However, they are considered enchanted and can be kept at bay by *holy circle*and destroyed or driven off by *dispel evil.*

###### Ecology

Leyak can be found everywhere there are infants and children for them to feed upon. Often they will pretend to be itinerant entertainers or priestesses. They tend not to settle in one place for long, as their depredations eventually draw suspicion from the local residents. Leyak are usually encountered alone while hunting for prey, but they make their lairs with others of their kind.

###### Spoils

A slain leyak can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the following components useful in magic research:

* blood (5 5/6 st, 350gp, *trollblood, youthfulness*)
* entrails (4 st, 240gp, any death or necromancy effect)
* eyes (4 st, 240gp, *cone of fear, frighten crowd, inspire horror, panic*)
* tongue (4 st, 240gp, *life transfer, telekinesis, tongues*)

###### Encounter

Nestled in a clearing is a shrine to Dahag, the Somirean god of death (Dirgion to the Aurans). Constructed of dark grey andesite rock, the 15’ x 15’ shrine stands on a 3.5’ high base. Its north, west, and east sides are adorned with high-relief sculptures of rakshasa and yali doing battle. On its south side, a stairway ascends upward through a 5’ x 5’ corbelled chamber to access a door into the interior of the shrine. Above, a five-stepped roof soars to 20’, its pinnacle a star of black iron. Inside, a stone-lined pit, 5’ square and 20’ deep, occupies the center of the shrine’s interior.

At the bottom of the pit lies a pile of earth, charcoal, and burned bones. The west and east walls of the interior are adorned with funerary prayers and rites of preparation for death. The north wall is carved with a high-relief sculpture of Dahag. The whole shrine is a shadowed sinkhole of evil (see p. XX).

The shrine receives offerings daily, brought by parents hoping Dahag will spare their progeny from a deadly sickness that plagues this region. These offerings are collected by the shrine’s caretakers, three middle-aged women, who offer prayers for protection from death on behalf of the donors.

Such prayers are quite efficacious, but not because the caretakers have any clerical power. They are actually a coven of **three** **leyak**, and the deadly illness is caused by their nocturnal feeding. The leyak never feed on their donors, however, sustaining the illusion that “donations to Dahag” are rewarded.

**Leyak (3):** Spd 120’/120’ fly, AC 2/5, HD 6\*\*\*, hp 44, 29, 25, #AT 1 (tongue 5+), Dmg 1d4 {P!} + blood drain, Save M6, AL C; Special: blood drain (1d4 ongoing, deal 8hp in one blow to cut off), horrific (Paralysis save or cowed); Spells: 2 1st, 2 2nd, 2 3rd; Repertoire: 1st – *choking grip, summon manes*, 2nd – *invisibility, necromantic potence,* 3rd – *dismember, earth’s teeth*

The strongest of the leyaks (44hp) carries an ornamental katar (*dagger +1*) and carries a pair of gourds with coffee-colored broth (*potions of human control*). The rest of the trio’s treasure is kept in an ironbound casket hidden amidst the burned bones at the base of the pit.

Within are 2,000gp, 800 electrum plates (5gp each, 1 st per 100 plates), 120 lammasu feathers (8gp each, 1 st per 12 feathers), 10 pieces of ivory (40gp each, 1 st per 100gp), 8 seashells carved with religious iconography (120gp each), 12 tiny jade turtles (200gp each), and 4 alabaster figurines of Dahaga (300gp each). In addition, each creatures’ blood (350gp, 5 5/6 st), entrails (240gp, 4 st), eyes (240gp, 4 st), and tongue (240gp, 4 st) can be harvested as special components.

### Living Ancestor

When a dignified and prosperous dwarf passes, it is customary for his descendants to erect a larger-than-life statue in his memory. Such statutes are common sights in the grand galleries of the vaults of dwarves. Most of these statues are inert memorials to ancestors whose souls have passed on. But in some… the ancestor lives.

A living ancestor resembles a 6’ tall funerary statue, but it is actually a magical construct that carries within it the soul of the dwarf it memorializes. To become a living ancestor is an act of willing self-sacrifice, for the dwarf who allows the craftpriests to bind his lifeforce into the stone forgoes any hope of reincarnation or afterlife. Only the most powerful dwarves can survive the agonizing transformation, and only the most committed, desperate, or vengeful would dare it.

###### Combat

Every living ancestor was once a dwarf of at least 10th level. The living ancestor retains all of the class powers and proficiencies it had in life. It can also continue to advance after its transformation, gaining additional class powers and spells where applicable, using the rules for monstrous advancement (p. XX). For instance, a craftpriest who becomes a living ancestor and advances to 11 HD would gain 6th level spells and access to ritual magic.

Living ancestors can attack with a stone fist or with any weapon with which they are proficient. When striking with melee weapons, the living ancestor deals double damage dice and can add his class damage bonus (if any). When striking with his fist, the living ancestor deals 3d8 {B!} damage, but does not get his class damage bonus.

Living ancestors are **immune** to enchantment effects, necrotic damage, poisonous damage, and all mundane damage. They are **resistant** to extraordinary cold, electric, fire, piercing, and slashing damage. They also benefit from **magic resistance** to spells and spell-like effects. When a living ancestor is affected by a spell or spell-like effect, it can (but does not have to) make a magic resistance throw with a +3 bonus. If the result of the throw equals or exceeds the caster level of the spell or spell-like effect, the living ancestor ignores it. As constructs, living ancestors count as enchanted creatures for purposes of spells such as *dispel evil*and *holy circle*.

###### Ecology

A mere soul is not enough to move a quarter-ton of rock. In order to remain animate, a living ancestor must receive 1,200 divine power from the congregation of a craftpriest each week. If, for whatever reason, the living ancestor does not receive the needed divine power, it begins to slow down. Each week that passes without sufficient divine power, the living ancestor reduces its exploration speed by 10’. When its exploration speed is reduced to 0’, the living ancestor becomes inert and **paralyzed**. An inert living ancestor enters a hibernation and no longer needs divine power. A slowed or inert living ancestor can be restored to mobility by paying additional divine power. For instance, a living ancestor that had no divine power for 10 weeks would need 1,200 divine power to gain 10’ speed and 7,2000 to gain its full mobility in addition to the ordinary 1,200 per week.

### Lizardman

These scaly beastmen were magically crossbred from men and giant lizards sometime after the Day Without Night. The dwarves claim that the elves of southern Argollë bred them, but the elves hotly dispute this. All agree that lizardmen once had a powerful empire centered on the city of Thrassia, from which they which dominated southern Aurëpos and eastern Ulruk. In the centuries since they have degenerated to a state of primitive savagery.

Adult lizardmen stand 6' to 7' tall, resembling humans with the heads, claws, scales, and tails of lizards. They are sometimes found in dungeons, especially if there is an aquatic entrance. They otherwise dwell in lagoons, marshes, swamps and similar wetlands.

Lizardmen speak their own language, a degenerate form of Ancient Thrassian. A lizardman warrior has a 10% chance of speaking Common, while a leader has a 10% chance per HD.

###### Combat

Lizardmen rely on their **scaly hides** for armor, which grant a +3 AC bonus. They are **formidable warriors** and receive a +1 damage bonus with weapons. While not truly amphibious, they can **hold their breaths** for up to 1 turn.

Lizardmen warriors are usually equipped with shields, stone hand axes, and 5 barbed darts or 3 javelins. 10% of warbands retain the sophistication to make and maintain leather armor (+2 AC). Lizardmen primarily use weapons at range. Once they enter melee, they drop their shields to fight with their claws and bite (suffering a -1 penalty to AC to do so).

###### Ecology

Each lizardman gang will be led by a champion with 5 AC, 3+1 HD, 17 hp, and a +2 damage bonus (+1 with its natural attacks). Each lizardman warband will be led by a sub-chieftain with 6 AC, 4+1 HD, 21 hp, and a +3 damage bonus (+2 with its natural attacks). A lizardman lair will be led by a chieftain with 7 AC, 6+2 HD, 30 hp, and a +3 damage bonus (+2 with its natural attacks). As long as the chieftain is alive, the lizardmen will gain a +2 bonus to morale rolls. Lizardmen lairs will have drudges and eggs equal to 100% and 100% of the number of warriors. Lizardmen drudges have Spd 90’, AC 3, HD 2, and attack with 1 bite (1d6 {P}) or weapon.

When lizardmen are encountered in a village, certain additional creatures may be present. There is a 60% chance a lizardman village will be guarded by 1d6 lounges of giant lizards. There is a 50% chance for 1d10 enslaved captives per warband. A lizardman village has a 75% chance of a shaman being present, and a 50% chance of a witch doctor. A shaman is equivalent to a sub-chieftain statistically, but has Shaman abilities at level 1d6. A witch doctor is equivalent to a champion statistically, but has Mage abilities of level 1d4.

###### Spoils

A slain lizardman can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 2 for the following component:

###### Lore

*Researchers began with a stock of male human captives. They then introduced a stock of giant lizards into the program. The resultant admixture possessed substantial strength and endurance and was able to endure sun and water in equal measure. The adjoining illustration is of one such “lizardman”, though the reader no doubt has seen these magnificent, loyal specimens at work in our cities and villas.*

* Caoláin, *The Illuminated Primer of Alchemy*

### Lizard, Giant Draco

The giant draco measures about 6’ long and weighs about 170 lbs. It has large skin flaps below its limbs that make it capable of gliding in the air.

The sages of the Tower of Knowledge believe that the giant draco, as well as the other species of giant lizards, were bred from ordinary lizards as fighting beasts and pets by the ancient Thrassians.

Whatever their origin, they are now widespread throughout the known world. They are particularly commonly in the jungles of Somirea and Ulruk, but have also been known to take up residence in warm, humid caves and dungeons.

###### Combat

Giant draco lizards prefer to attack from above. They are also **skilled climbers** able to ascend sheer surfaces as if they were thieves (6+). Once they have perched on a high branch or rocky outcropping, they wait for prey to pass by, then glide down and snatch it.

###### Ecology

When a wilderness lair of giant geckos is encountered, there is a 25% chance per lizard that it will have buried a clutch of 1d4+1 eggs nearby. The eggs have 1 hp and weight 1/6 st. Draco hatchlings are rarely found in nests, because the creatures immediately disperse into the wild after they emerge from their eggs.

###### Spoils

A slain giant draco can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following component:

* wings (2 2/6 st, 140gp, *leaping,* armor +1)

From time to time, enterprising adventurers attempt to capture and rear giant draco lizards. The creatures are as stupid and surly as all giant lizards, but have the benefit of a short life cycle.

###### Encounter

Overlooking a small forest is a large rocky outcropping extending over 50' into the air. Basking on this rock, but hidden from below, are **five giant draco lizards**. In the forest undergrowth below the outcropping, the lizards have buried **eleven draco eggs**. If the eggs are threatened, the giant draco lizards will swoop down and attack.

### Lizard, Giant Gecko

The giant gecko is a 5’ long nocturnal predator that weighs about 110 lbs. The sages of the Tower of Knowledge believe that the giant gecko, along with the other species of giant lizard, was bred from ordinary lizards as fighting beasts and pets by the ancient Thrassians.

Whatever their origin, giant geckos are now widespread throughout the known world. They are extremely diverse in their range, and can be found in barrens, deserts, forests, jungles, and even urban settlements. Some also take up residence in warm, humid caves and dungeons.

###### Combat

Giant geckos, like their smaller cousins, are **natural climbers**. They can climb utterly unimpeded across vertical surfaces or move upside down across ceilings at their combat movement rate. They can attack with their bites and defend themselves normally, but cannot charge or run while climbing. (Note that this is not just Climbing proficiency.)

###### Ecology

When a wilderness lair of giant geckos is encountered, there is a 25% chance per lizard that it will have hidden a clutch of 1d2 eggs under rocks, in crevices, or in tree hollows nearby. The eggs have 1 hp and weight 1/6 st. Gecko hatchlings are rarely found in nests, because the creatures immediately disperse into the wild after they emerge from their eggs.

###### Spoils

A slain giant gecko can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following component:

* feet (1 stone, 65gp, s*pider climb,* armor +1)

Adventurers sometimes attempt to capture and rear giant geckos, but the creatures are quite stupid and surly and most such efforts fail.

###### Encounter

Rising from the arid terrain is a formation of nineteen sandstone rocks shaped like stunted trees. The “trees” are each between 18’ and 25’ tall, and were formed by years of erosion from strong winds carrying rough sand. Perched on the “tree” tops are **six giant gecko lizards**. One of the geckos has recently laid a clutch of **two gecko eggs**,concealed by sandstone pebbles in the mist of the rock formation. If the eggs are threatened, the giant gecko lizards will attack.

### Lizard, Giant Horned Chameleon

The giant horned chameleon measures about 7’ long and weighs around 200 lbs. The sages of the Tower of Knowledge believe that giant horned chameleons, along with the other species of giant lizard, were bred from ordinary lizards as fighting beasts and pets by the ancient Thrassians.

Whatever their origin, giant horned chameleons are now widespread throughout the known world. They prefer to live in forests, forested hills, and forested mountains, but can also be found in scrubland, swamps, and underground.

###### Combat

Gant horned chameleons have the uncanny ability to **camouflage** themselves by taking on the color, appearance, and texture of their local surroundings. They can hide as 14th level thieves (2+). They have **acute vision** and gain a +1 bonus to avoid surprise in their natural habitat. They are also **skilled climbers** able to ascend sheer surfaces as if they were thieves (6+).

The giant horned chameleon has two special attacks which it can use in lieu of its regular attacks. Instead of biting a target, it can lash out with its long, sticky tongue to attack creatures up to 15’ away. If the chameleon succeeds on a tongue attack against a small or man-sized creature, it can immediately **yank** the creature adjacent to itself and make a bite attack against it. However, the chameleon cannot cleave with its bite on any round when it makes a tongue attack.

Instead of goring a target, the chameleon can make a tail lash. If this attack succeeds, the target struck must make a successful Paralysis save or be knocked **prone**. If the chameleon knocks its target prone, it can cleave with the tail.

###### Ecology

When a wilderness lair of giant horned chameleons is encountered, there is an 8% chance per lizard that it will have buried a clutch of 1d4+1 eggs nearby. The eggs have 1 hp and weight 1/6 st. Chameleon hatchlings are rarely found in nests, because the creatures immediately disperse into the wild after they emerge from their eggs.

###### Spoils

A slain giant horned chameleon can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following components useful in magic research:

* dorsal scales (3 2/6 st, 200gp, *chameleon, invisibility,* armor +1)
* tongue (2 2/6 st, 150gp, *earth’s excrescence, earth’s wave, telekinesis*)

A giant horned chameleon's single horn fetches 1d3gp and weights 1 st per 10gp value.

Giant horned chameleons are sometimes captured and trained as hunting animals. Though they are as stupid and surly as their cousins, they are the most economically valuable of the giant lizards.

### Lizard, Giant Tuatara

The giant tuatara is an 8' long 250 lb carnivore with formidable spikes that run the length of its dorsal side. The sages of the Tower of Knowledge believe that giant tuatara, along with other species of giant lizard, were bred from ordinary lizards as fighting beasts and pets by the ancient Thrassians.

Whatever their origin, giant tuatara are now widespread throughout the known world. They are frequently found in the coastal forests and shrublands of Aurëpos as well as across the Syrnasos Islands.

###### Combat

Tuataras are nocturnal predators. They hunt primarily by ambush, waiting motionless for prey to come within range. A special membrane-like eyelid over a tuatara’s eyes grants it **lightless vision** to 90’.

###### Ecology

When a wilderness lair of giant tuataras is encountered, there is a 10% chance per lizard that it will have buried a clutch of 1d10+5 eggs nearby. The eggs have 1 hp and weight 1/6 st. Tuatara hatchlings are rarely found in nests, because the creatures immediately disperse into the wild after they emerge from their eggs.

###### Spoils

A slain giant tuatara can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following component:

* eyelids (5 2/6 st, 320gp, *lightless vision, mass lightless vision,* armor +1, weapon +1

Adventurers sometimes attempt to capture and rear giant tuatara, but the creatures are quite stupid and surly and take a very long time to mature. Few would-be lizard trainers have the patient to wait decades.

###### Encounter

A great oak snag stands here, some 46’ tall and 21’ in circumference. Its top branches have withered away, while a hollow at its base leads into an underground cavity, 8’ deep and 12’ in diameter, from which extend seven tunnels, each about 6’ in diameter. Excavated from amongst its dead roots, these burrows are the lair of **three giant tuatara**. The tuatara are perpetually hungry and will emerge to attack adventurers who bypass the lair. **Six tuatara eggs** are hidden among the roots in the burrow.

Giant tuatara lizard (3): Spd 90’, AC 5, HD 6, hp 35, 31, 22, #AT 3 (2 claws/bite 5+), Dmg 1d4 {S} / 1d4 {S} /2d6 {P}, Save F4, ML -2, AL N, XP 320

### Locust, Cavern

Cavern locusts resemble giant grasshoppers with the color of dull stone, measuring 2’ to 3’ in length and weighing 15 lbs. They are rarely seen aboveground but they are common in caves and dungeons. They survive on fungus and mold that grows underground. Cavern locusts are particularly loathed by the mushroom-farming dwarves, for whom they are perennial plague.

###### Combat

Cavern locusts are exceptionally skittish and prone to panic. When threatening creatures approach, cavern locusts will begin to issue **alarming shrieks** so loudly that it will attract wandering monsters. The Judge should roll an encounter throw each round that one or more cave locusts are in combat. If wandering monsters are indicated, they will arrive in 1d4 rounds.

Although capable of scuttling on land and flying in the air, during combat the easily-panicked cavern locusts will use their movement action to **haphazardly jump** in random directions. Each jump will carry a locust 1d6 x 10 feet in a random clock direction (use 1d12, with “12” being the locust’s current facing). If the locust’s jump carries it into or through a creature’s location, the cavern locust will make a slam attack against the creature, with a hit dealing 1d4 {B} damage.

After jumping, the locust can either bite with its mandibles or expel a **poisonous brown spittle** at a target within 15’. When attacking with its spittle, the locust can ignore the target’s AC from armor, but not AC from DEX, magic items, natural armor, or spells. If struck, the target must succeed in a Death saving throw or starts **vomiting** from the horrible smell for 1 turn. Until the spittle is rinsed off, each creature that starts its initiative or moves within 5' of a spit-soaked creature must make a successful Death save or become **queasy** until the end of its initiative.

Because they have evolved to consume highly toxic molds, cavern locusts are **immune** to all poisonous damage.

###### Ecology

When a nest of cavern locusts is encountered, the locusts will have 5d10 eggs lain nearby. The eggs have 1 hp and weight 1/200 st. Locust nymphs are rarely found in nests, because the nymphs immediately disperse into the wild after they emerge from their eggs.

###### Spoils

A slain cavern locust can be harvested with Animal Husbandry 2 for the following components useful in magic research

* antenna (1/6 st., 10gp, *bloody flux, cloud of poison, physical protection (poisonous)*)
* salivary gland (2/6 st., 20gp, *leaping, mage missile, thunderclap*)

### Lycanthrope

The first lycanthropes were cultists of Nargund, the Beast Lord, Chthonic god of hunting, predation, and nightfall. In blood-soaked rituals performed under the full moon, the cultists gained the powerful to transform into savage wolves. For a time, the werewolf legions of Nargund were the most feared force in the Zaharan Empire. Jealous of the power the cultists of the Beast Lord had gained, some of the other cults developed their own rituals. The cultists of Bel, the Slaughterprince, became wereboars; those of Galmorm, the Horned Rat, became wererats; and those of Ravanor, the Bitter Prince, became weretigers. The only Empyrean god who has created lycanthropes is Naurivus, who transformed some devotees into werebears.

###### Lycanthropic Forms

Most lycanthropes have two forms, a human form and a beast form. (Wererats have three forms, see p. XX). When a lycanthrope is in its human form, it resembles an ordinary person but it always has certain secondary characteristics in common with the animal type it is capable of transforming into. When a lycanthrope is in its human form, it has no special abilities except the ability to transform into its beast form.

When a lycanthrope is in its beast form, it gains a number of special abilities based on its type. It also becomes **immune** to mundane bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. However, it treats damage dealt by silver weapons as extraordinary damage. It is **resistant** to all other mundane damage. As an enchanted creature, a lycanthrope can be kept at bay by *holy circle* and destroyed or driven off by *dispel evil*.

When in human form, a lycanthrope speaks whatever humanoid languages it knows. When in beast form, a lycanthrope retains the ability to understand those languages, but it cannot speak them. It can communicate with other lycanthropes or beasts of its type through grunts, growls, howls, and so on.

A lycanthrope can switch between its forms as a movement action. If the lycanthrope is clothed when it transforms, the transformation destroys any ordinary clothing. If the lycanthrope is armored when it transforms, the armor deals 1 bludgeoning damage per AC bonus to the werecreature and is then destroyed. Magic armor or clothing is not destroyed, but instead falls off after dealing damage (if any).

When reduced to 0 hp, a lycanthrope automatically reverts to its human form.

Wolfsbane is a ward against all lycanthropes. A lycanthrope struck with wolfsbane must make a successful Paralysis saving throw or flee as if its morale had failed.

Animals with Acute Olfaction can smell lycanthropes in human form and – unless of the same type – will act as if in the presence of predators. Dogs might growl, horses bolt, etc.

###### The Disease of Lycanthropy

If lycanthropes were merely men who changed into beasts, they would still be considered dangerous, but no more terrifying than a bugbear or ogre. What makes werecreatures terrifying is that their “blessing” is actually a disease that can be passed onto others: **lycanthropy**.

Lycanthropy can be acquired by two means. First, it can be inherited from a parent. Children born to one lycanthrope have a 50% chance of becoming lycanthropes at puberty. Children born to two lycanthropes always become lycanthropes at puberty. Children always becomes the same type of lycanthrope as their parent(s). If the parents are not the same kind of lycanthrope, the type is determined randomly between the two. Inherited lycanthropy can never be cured.

Second, it can be transmitted through wounds. Any humanoid that takes damage from a lycanthrope’s claws or bites equaling 50% or more of his maximum hp becomes infected.

If the infected creature is demi-human or humanoid rather than human, he will become **incapacitated** after 2d6 days and die another 2d6 days later.

If the infected creature is human, he will transform into a lycanthrope of the type that wounded him when the next full moon rises. Starting 1d6 days before that transformation, the infected character will begin to show signs of the upcoming change, taking on the secondary characteristics of the type.

A humanoid can be cured of transmitted lycanthropy with *cure disease* any time before he dies or first transforms.

When a human first transforms into a lycanthrope, he immediately enters beast form and remain in it until dawn. During this time, he is feral and savage, frequently killing or infecting those in his village or even family. When he returns to human form, the lycanthrope can either resist or give in to the lycanthropy.

While he resists the lycanthropy, a character retains his current alignment and personality. He transforms into beast form on each full moon (as above). He cannot voluntarily transform.

When he gives in to the lycanthropy, the character takes on the alignment and personality of his new form. He thereafter can control his transformation at will, retains his sapience in beast form, and need not transform on full moons.

### Lycanthrope, Werebear

Werebears are lycanthropes who can transform into cave bears. In their bear form they stand about 15’ tall and weigh over 1,000 lbs. In their human form they are typically quite hirsute with bulky torsos and long arms.

The Empyrean god Naurivus, Patron of Explorers, fastened the first werebears from a clan of warriors and woodsmen who volunteered to serve him. To ensure that the wilds would not be dominated by werewolves and their ilk, the god made the werebears the strongest of all lycanthropes.

Since werebears were created by an Empyrean god rather than a Chthonic one, they are untainted with supernatural evil. Like the humans they were made from, they can be of any alignment, though (again like humans) most are Neutral.

Werebears try to avoid infecting humans and demi-humans with their lycanthropy, so most werebears were born into their kind. From time to time, however, a werebear may transmit its disease by injury, either on purpose to a willing creature or by accident if forced to fight.

###### Combat

In beast form, werebears have **acute olfaction** and gain a +1 bonus to avoid surprise in its natural habitat. They can track the scent of creatures for up to 6 miles with the equivalent of three ranks of Tracking proficiency. They are also **skilled climbers**, able to ascend sheer surfaces as if they were thieves (6+).

If a werebear in beast form successfully attacks the same target with both claws in the same attack routine, it immediately **hugs** the target for an additional 2d8 {P!}damage. If the hug kills the target, the werebear can cleave with its claw.

###### Ecology

Werebears tend to be quite solitary, often dwelling alone or in small family groups. They tend to make their dens in caves or crude huts. When werebears are encountered in a wilderness lair, each werebear has a 25% chance to be accompanied by a sloth of 1d2 brown bears.

###### Spoils

A slain werebear can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the following components useful in magic research:

* blood (4 5/6 st, 285gp, *deflect ordinary weapons, skinchange*)
* scalp (4 5/6 st, 285gp, *slumber, transform beast*)

Because they revert to human form when slain, werebears cannot be harvested for claws, fangs, or fur.

### Lycanthrope, Wereboar

Wereboars are lycanthropes who can transform into giant boars. In their boar form, they measure about 7’4” long and weigh 650 – 700 lbs. In their human form, they often have snub noses with large nostrils and long, sharp lower canines.

The Chthonic god Bel, the Slaughterprince, fastened the first wereboars from the members of his blood-sacrificing berserker cult. Every wereboar combines the ill-temper of a wild boar with the bloodthirsty savagery of a berserker, making for a most unpleasant and brutal creature.

Wereboars attempt to pass their infection to strong and powerful warriors. However, they are so savage in their berserk bloodlust that they often kill the prey they intend to infect.

###### Combat

In beast form, wereboars have **acute hearing** and **acute olfaction.** They gain a +2 bonus to avoid surprise in their natural habitat. They can track the scent of creatures for up to 4 miles with the equivalent of two ranks of Tracking proficiency.

In both beast and human form, wereboars can go **berserk** anytime they make melee attacks. While berserk, a wereboar gains a +2 bonus to attack throws and becomes immune to fear. However, the wereboar has a -2 penalty to AC and becomes limited in its tactics. It cannot conduct defensive movement to retreat or withdraw from an enemy within 5’ and cannot move in such a way that the range between itself and the nearest visible threat would increase. It must advance 5’ after cleaving if necessary to do so to engage an enemy and it has sufficient movement. Once it has begun, the berserker age cannot be ended until combat ends. A wereboar that goes berserk in human form has a cumulative 10% chance of transforming into beast form each round.

When in human form, wereboars favor battle axes, hand axes, morning stars, spears, swords, and shields. They tend to eschew missile fire.

###### Ecology

Wereboars make their dens in huts or shacks, preferably in wooded regions with wildlife to hunt and the occasional traveler to rob.

###### Spoils

A slain wereboar can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the following components useful in magic research:

* blood (2 st, 115gp, *deflect ordinary weapons, skinchange*)
* scalp (1 4/6 st, 100gp, *righteous wrath, transform beast*)

Because they revert to human form when slain, wereboars cannot be harvested for claws, fangs, or fur.

### Lycanthrope, Wererat

Wererats are lycanthropes who can transform into giant rats and ratmen. In their human form, they often have beady eyes, receding chins, whiskery mustaches, and pointed ears. In all their forms they remain around the same weight and size.

The Chthonic god Galmorm, the Horned Rat, god of lies, treachery, and sabotage, created the first wererats in order to further his divine agenda.

Unlike other lycanthropes, which have only two forms (human and beast), wererats can assume an **intermediate form** resembling a humanoid ratman. A wererat in this form can wield human weapons and speak human languages, but retains all of the special abilities of beast form.

Most wererats were born lycanthropes and see themselves as part of a distinct species, superior to ordinary humanity. Since wererats tend to fight with weapons in intermediate form, they rarely transmit lycanthropy by bite. From time to time, however, the cunning creatures will strategically transmit their disease to “worthy” recruits who would be useful for their contacts or wealth.

###### Combat

In beast and intermediate form, wererats have **acute hearing** and gain a +1 bonus to avoid surprise in its natural habitat. They are **skilled climbers**, able to ascend sheer surfaces as if they were thieves (5+).

In all three forms, wererats are **naturally stealthy**. Characters encountering them suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls.

Wererats hate fair fights and prefer assassination and ambush. They often equip themselves like thieves with weapons such as crossbows, daggers, saps, and short swords. Where available, wererats will use poisoned weapons.

###### Ecology

Wererats prefer to live in or near human settlements, favoring large towns and cities with extensive sewer systems. They dwell in packs, with a core of closely-related family along with various recent recruits.

When wererats are encountered in their lair, they have a 75% chance to be accompanied by a nest of 3d10 giant rats.

###### Spoils

A slain wererat can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the following components useful in magic research:

* blood (3/6 st, 35gp, *deflect ordinary weapons, skinchange*)
* scalp (3/6 st, 30gp, *silent step, transform beast*)

Because they revert to human form when slain, wererats cannot be harvested for claws, fangs, or fur.

### Lycanthrope, Weretiger

Weretigers are lycanthropes who can transform into tigers. In their tiger form, they measure about 7’6” long and weigh about 500 lbs. In their human form, they often have almond-shaped eyes, supple muscles, and colorful streaks of black or gold in their hair.

The Chthonic god Ravanor, the Bitter Prince, created the first weretigers to cause terror in the weak and innocent. Like their god, weretigers are arrogant, cunning, and utterly ruthless.

Weretigers prefer to find mates from among the human population, seeking out the most beautiful and healthy specimens and infecting them with lycanthropy.

###### Combat

In beast form, weretigers have **acute hearing** and **acute olfaction.** They gain a +2 bonus to avoid surprise in their natural habitat. They can track the scent of creatures for up to 4 miles with the equivalent of two ranks of Tracking proficiency.

As beasts, they are also **quite agile** (Acrobatics 12+) and **good climbers** (Climbing 5+). Their **lightning reflexes** grant a +1 bonus to initiative. They are **naturally stealthy** when in native habitats, where creatures encountering them suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls.

If a weretiger charges a creature or leaps over it (using Acrobatics), and successfully hits it with both claws, it immediately **pounces** onthe creature. The weretiger’s subsequent bite attack automatically hits and the creature that has been pounced on must make a successful size-adjusted Paralysis saving throw or be knocked **prone**.

###### Ecology

Weretigers prefer to dwell in forests or jungles near human settlements. In the Sunset Kingdoms, weretigers are often considered avatars of the gods or rakshasa, and placated with offerings of food, wine, and treasure.

###### Spoils

A slain weretiger can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the following components useful in magic research:

* blood (3 st, 180gp, *deflect ordinary weapons, skinchange*)
* scalp (2 5/6 st, 170gp, *call of the great cats, silent step, transform beast*)

Because they revert to human form when slain, werertigers cannot be harvested for claws, fangs, or fur.

### Lycanthrope, Werewolf

Werewolves are lycanthropes who can transform into wolves. In their wolf form, they stand about 2.5” to 3’ tall at the shoulder and weigh about 180 lbs. In their human form, they often have large noses, strong jaws, and wolfish grins with large canines.

The Chthonic god Nargund, the Beast Lord, created the first werewolves, which were also the very first lycanthropes. As the progenitors of lycanthropy, werewolves are dominated by their animal nature more than other lycanthropes.

###### Combat

In beast form, werewolves have **acute hearing** and **acute olfaction.** They gain a +2 bonus to avoid surprise in their natural habitat. They can track the scent of creatures for up to 4 miles with the equivalent of two ranks of Tracking.

Due to their powerful jaws, werewolves have **bone-breaking bites**. If the werewolf succeeds on an attack throw with an unmodified 20 , the creature bitten must make a Death saving throw. If the save succeeds, the creature suffers double the ordinary damage dice (4d4 {P!}). If the save fails, the creature suffers triple the ordinary damage (6d4 {P!}) and has a limb broken. Roll 1d6 to determine which limb is broken: 1-2 weapon hand, 3 weapon arm, 4-5 near leg, 6 far leg. A broken limb has the same game effect as a missing limb (***ACKS II RR***Permanent wounds tables, p. XX – XX) until it heals. A broken wound heals after 180 days, or 90 days under treatment of a healer.

###### Ecology

Werewolves organize themselves into packs led by the strongest and fiercest. As they age, werewolves tend to spend more and more of their time in beast form. They may go weeks, months, or even years without reverting to human form. Many werewolves eventually come to live in burrowed holes, talus caves, and other natural dens.

###### Spoils

A slain werewolf can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the following components useful in magic research:

* blood (1 1/6 st, 70gp, *deflect ordinary weapons, skinchange*)
* scalp (1 st, 65gp, *call of the wolf, transform beast*)

Because they revert to human form when slain, werewolves cannot be harvested for claws, fangs, or fur.
