## Monster Alignment

A monster’s alignment is restricted by its type:

1. Animals, being typically concerned with mere survival, are generally Neutral. Some animals, blessed by gods or powerfully symbolic of virtue and order, may be Lawful. The Narwhal is an example of a Lawful animal. Animals, as part of the natural world, are never Chaotic.
2. Beastmen, as the product of ancient sorcery that crossed humans with animals and monsters, are typically Chaotic. Some, such as centaurs, have escaped the taint of Chaos, but being unnatural and monstrous they are almost never Lawful.
3. Enchanted creatures and monstrosities may be of any alignment. If sapient, their alignment will vary based on their ethical beliefs and innate dispositions. If of bestial or mindless intelligence, they are typically Neutral, but it is not uncommon for them to be Lawful or Chaotic. The magical nature and sorcerous origin of enchanted and monstrosities might cause them to serve Law or Chaos in a brute manner. Wyverns are an example of Chaotic monstrosities of animal intelligence.
4. Humanoids and giant humanoids may be of any alignment, depending on their ethical beliefs and innate disposition. Thus, Dwarves are Lawful, Elves are Neutral, and Morlocks are Chaotic. Individual members of these species may, of course, vary from the typical alignment of their kind.
5. Oozes and vermin, though disgusting and destructive, are nevertheless typically Neutral. Particularly horrific monsters of these types, created with dark sorcery, might be Chaotic. Giant scorpions, which are said to have been born from the blood of a Chaotic demigod, are an example of Chaotic vermin.
6. Incarnations may be either Lawful, Neutral or Chaotic, depending on their disposition. Herald Angels are an example of Lawful incarnations, while Efreeti are Chaotic incarnations.
7. Undead are always Chaotic.

These alignment restrictions by type and intelligence are summarized on the Monster Alignment table. As always, you are the final arbiter of your monster’s characteristics and can overrule these restrictions if desired.
