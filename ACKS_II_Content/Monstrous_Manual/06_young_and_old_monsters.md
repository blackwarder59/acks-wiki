## Young and Old Monsters

Some lairs may include cubs, foals, fledglings, and other young monsters; others may include middle aged, old, or ancient monsters. Except as otherwise noted in the monster listing, monster characteristics should be adjusted as shown on the Monster Age Adjustment table, below. Armor Class is reduced by 1 or more points, while movement, Hit Dice, normal load, and damage should be reduced to a fraction of normal value, depending on age. The following additional rules apply:

* Baby monsters are two size categories smaller than adults, while juvenile monsters are one size category smaller. Adolescent and older monsters are a full size (more or less).
* When calculating HD, treat each +/-1 as +/-0.25. Round the result to the nearest 0.25 and convert it back into +/-. Monsters reduced to fewer than ¼ HD have 1 hp and do not fight at all.
* When calculating Speed, multiply the adjustment by the creature’s speed/120’. Round to the nearest 30’. Monsters do not gain the ability to fly until they reach adolescent age except where otherwise noted.
* When calculating normal load, round to the nearest stone. Round 0.5 up if negative, down if positive.
* When calculating damage, the Monster Age Damage calculator table can be used to find new damage values for each of the monster’s attacks. Find the damage from the monster’s attack and cross-reference it with the age to find the new damage. A value of “-” means the monster of that age is too weak to deal damage with that attack.
* Monsters do not gain any special abilities until they reach adolescent age except where otherwise noted.
* Young or old monsters with fewer than ¼ HD are noncombatants with 1 hp and ML -4. If attacked, they must make a morale roll every round, and if defeated, they do not provide XP.

EXAMPLE: An adult lion has AC 3, HD 5, hp 22, MV 150’, and maximum load 50. It has an attack throw of 6+ and deals 1d4+1 points of damage with its claws and 1d10 with its bite. An ancient lion has AC 0, HD 1+2, hp 7, MV 115’, and normal load 21. As a 1+2 HD creature, it has an attack throw of 9+ and deals 1 point of damage with its claws and 1d2 damage with its bite.

### Aging for Monsters with Ability Scores

The age adjustments above were actually developed by applying the normal effects of aging (*ACKS,* p. 248XX) to a monster with default ability scores of 9 in each characteristic.

| In the example below, the ancient lion’s characteristics when calculated with ability score adjustments were nearly identical to those of an ancient lion’s characteristics calculated using the Monster Age Adjustment table. This will not always be the case. Sometimes the results will differ between different ability score breakpoints and Hit Die ranges. In-world, this can be considered the normal variability of the effects of aging. The Judge may use whichever method he prefers for any given monster. |

If you are using ability scores for the monster (p. XX), then the aging effects for AC, speed, HD, and damage can be calculated by applying the appropriate penalty (-6, -4, or -2) for the age category (Baby/Ancient, Child/Old, and Adolescent/Middle-Aged) respectively.

Adjustments for size and maximum load should still be applied using the Monster Age Adjustment table.

EXAMPLE: An adult lion with 9 STR, DEX, and CON has AC 3, HD 5, MV 150’, and maximum load 50. It has an attack throw of 6+ and deals 1d4+1 points of damage with its claws and 1d10 with its bite. Years later, it has become ancient, leaving it with 3 STR, DEX, and CON. This reduces its AC to 0 and its MV by 35’ to 115’ [150’ – (30’ x 150’/120’)], and maximum load to 50 – [3 x 25/10] 42. As a 5 HD creature with a -3 STR penalty, it has an attack throw of 9+. It deals 1d4-3 points of damage with its claws and 1d10-3 damage with its bite. Its HD are reduced by 3 points per die, from 22 down to 7.
