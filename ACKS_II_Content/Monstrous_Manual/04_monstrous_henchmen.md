## Monstrous Henchmen

The monstrous henchman – be it the white wolf at the side of a black-clad ranger, the draconic mount of a young champion, the noble steed of a gleaming knight, or the beastman chief at the side of the evil overlord – is a staple of fantasy literature. The rules below allow adventurers to recruit monsters as henchmen and advance them in power over time.

### Recruiting Monstrous Henchmen

Adventurers with Beast Friendship proficiency or Friends of Birds and Beasts class power can recruit animals (including giant and prehistoric animals) as henchmen. All adventurers can recruit sapient monsters of the beastman, giant, humanoid, monstrosity, and undead types. Monsters (of whatever type) count against the total number of henchmen the character can lead.

Before being recruited, monsters must first be found. Normal animals, such as hunting dogs or warhorses, can of course be found and purchased in markets using the standard rules for Equipment Availability by Market Class (***ACKS II RR****,* p. 39). Small numbers of sapient monsters might be available for hire in large towns and cities. Otherwise, monstrous henchmen must be recruited from those encountered on dungeon delves, wilderness expeditions, and sea journeys.

To be recruited, monstrous henchmen must have fewer HD than their employer has levels. A 1st level character can recruit monsters with 1-1 HD or less. A 14th level character could recruit monsters of less than 14 HD. Monsters with 14 HD or more (such as giant rocs) can only be recruited as henchmen by other, more powerful monsters.

A monster can only be offered employment at the start of an encounter if the monster’s reactions are Neutral, Indifferent, or Friendly (see *ACKS,* p. 99). Alternatively, a monster can be offered employment at the close of combat if it is defeated and captured. In either case, the adventurer must be able to intelligibly communicate with the monster.

When an adventurer attempts to recruit a monster, you should determine the monster’s response to an employment offer with a reaction roll of 2d6. If the monster was found in a market or peacefully encountered on an adventure, you should make the reaction roll on the Reaction to Hiring Offer table (*ACKS,* p. 49) to determine the result. If the monster was defeated and captured, you should use the Irrefusable Offer table, below. The adventurer’s CHA modifier is applied as a die roll modifier, along with any bonuses for Diplomacy, Intimidation, or other proficiencies. If the adventurer and the monster are of opposite alignments, apply a -2 penalty. If the monster is independent, apply its morale modifier (if any) as a negative modifier to the recruitment roll. If the monster was part of a group (warband or tribe) defeated in battle, apply its previous leader’s morale modifier (if any) instead. You can apply any other adjustments you feel are appropriate.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Irrefusable Offer** | |
| **Adjusted Die Roll (2d6)** | **Result** |
| 2- | Betrayal |
| 3-5 | Escape |
| 6-8 | Hesitate |
| 9-11 | Accept |
| 12+ | Accept with élan |

**Betray** means that the monster will pretend to accept the offer in order to betray the adventurer when the opportunity presents itself. The monster secretly hates and loathes its “employer” and will actively work against the adventurer’s interests.

**Escape** means that the monster will pretend to accept the offer in order to save its own life. It will desert from the adventurer’s service if an opportunity to safely do so presents itself. The monster might attempt to harm the adventurer during the course of its desertion if able to do so, but escape rather than betrayal will be its objective.

**Hesitate** means that the monster will accept the offer, but it feels uncertain loyalties. It begins its service with a loyalty score of -2 instead of 0. **Accept** means that the monster becomes loyal to the character, with a loyalty score of 0. **Accept with élan** means the offer is accepted with very good spirit, and the henchmen’s loyalty score begins at +1.

### Paying Monstrous Henchmen

Sapient monstrous henchmen are typically hired for a half-share of treasure and a monthly fee for food, lodging, and expenses. The monstrous henchmen’s monthly fee is determined using the Henchmen Monthly Fee table (*ACKS,* p. 51), substituting Hit Dice for level.

An animal henchman need not be paid a share of the adventurer’s income, but its care and training is nevertheless quite expensive. These costs are equal to the animal’s supply cost (p. XX) plus additional costs equal to the wages of a henchmen of its Hit Dice (*ACKS,* p. 51).

### Advancing Monstrous Henchmen

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Monster Size and Hit Dice** | |
| **Size** | **Maximum Hit Dice** |
| Man-Sized or less | 9 |
| Large | 13 |
| Huge | 17 |
| Gigantic | 25 |
| Colossal | 40 |

A monstrous henchman may advance its characteristics through adventuring. It requires 3,000 XP plus 500 XP per special ability (\*) for a 1 HD monster to advance to 2 HD. The amount of XP required doubles with each HD (round values greater than 20,000 XP to the nearest 1,000).

Monsters have a maximum Hit Dice determined by their size, as shown on the Monster Size and Hit Dice table. Sapient monsters may advance past this limit by up to an additional 5 Hit Dice, but gain a fixed 2 hp per HD with no Constitution bonus while doing so. Enchanted creatures (of any type) and undead may advance in Hit Dice without limit.

EXAMPLE: A leopard is a man-sized animal with 4 HD. It requires 24,000 XP for the leopard to advance to 5 HD; 48,000 XP to advance to 6 HD; 96,000 XP to advance to 7HD; 192,000 XP to 8HD, and 384,000 XP to advance to 9 HD. It cannot advance further because 9 HD is the maximum for a man-sized animal. If the leopard were an orc, it could continue to advance an additional 5 HD (up to 14) but would only gain 2 hp per each of the last 5 HD, with no CON modifier. If the leopard were an enchanted creature, it could continue to advance in HD without limit.

As a monster advances in Hit Dice, apply the following improvements to its characteristics:

* The monster’s attack throws improve by one per Hit Die.
* The monster’s saving throws improve based on its save progression relative to its HD (see p. XX).
* The monster’s AC improves by ½ (1 per 2 HD), to a maximum of its own starting HD.
* The monster deals an average of 2 hp more damage divided among all its attacks. You should decide how this is manifested. The Monster Attack Table (p. XX) can be used to calculate new damage dice if desired.
* If sapient, the monster may gain proficiencies as if it had advanced as a fighter (see p. XX). If of animal intelligence, the monster gains the ability to learn one additional trick.

EXAMPLE: A leopard has advanced from 4 HD to 5 HD, so it gains 1d8 hit points, its attack throw improves from 7+ to 6+, and it may learn one additional trick. Its AC was already 5, so it cannot improve. Its average damage increases by 2 points. A 4 HD panther deals an average of 9.5 points of damage across all of its attacks (1d4 from each claw and 1d8 from its bite). To increase average damage to 11.5, the Judge decides that the leopard’s claw damage improves from 1d4 to 1d6. This yields an average of 11.5 points of damage, as 3.5 (1d6 claw) + 3.5 (1d6 claw) + 4.5 (1d8 bite) = 11.5.
