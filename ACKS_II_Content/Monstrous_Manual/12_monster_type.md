## Monster Type

Monster types are groups of creatures with similar characteristics. The monster types are **animal**, **beastman**, **construct**, **enchanted creature**, **giant humanoid**, **humanoid**, **incarnation**, **monstrosity**, **ooze**, **plant**, **undead**, and **vermin**. A creature can belong to multiple types. For instance, skeletons are undead constructs. Monster type determines the effectiveness of various enchantment spells against the creature, the creatureâ€™s immunities and saving throws, and the number of special abilities it can possess. The **Monster Type** table summarizes these characteristics. See **Monster Types** (p. XX) in Chapter 1 for full descriptions of each type.
