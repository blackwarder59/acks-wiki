## Monster Body Form

Select an appropriate **body form** for the monster from the table below. The choice of body form will interact with the monster’s HD to determine its AC, weight, and normal load, and determines its natural attacks and movement. It also impacts the monster’s organization (p. XX) and intelligence (p. XX), discussed separately.

### Hybrid Body Forms

If desired, a monster may have a hybrid body form. You can assign the hybrid the movement capabilities of either or both body forms. If it has the movement of both, this counts as a special ability. The hybrid will have the AC modifier of the body form from which it was assigned its movement capabilities. If it has the movement of both, it will have whichever AC is better. A hybrid may be assigned the attacks of either or both body forms. If it has the attacks of both, this counts as a special ability. A hybrid may have the BME and CCF values of either body form or a mid-range value between the two.
