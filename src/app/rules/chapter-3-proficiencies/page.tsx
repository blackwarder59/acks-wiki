  description: 'The comprehensive skill and ability system for character development',
  introduction: `Proficiencies represent particular areas of expertise that your character has developed due to his background, homeland, and training. Each class has a **class list** of proficiencies, representing training that is particularly useful to the specific profession. In addition, there is a **general list** of proficiencies, which represent trade skills and knowledge that is widely available to all.

This chapter provides complete coverage of the ACKS II proficiency system, from the basic mechanics and how characters gain proficiencies, through the comprehensive lists organized by character class, to detailed descriptions of every proficiency available in the game.`,

      content: `<h1>The Basics of Proficiencies</h1>

<p>Proficiencies represent particular areas of expertise that your character has developed due to his background, homeland, and training. Each class has a <strong>class list</strong> of proficiencies, representing training that is particularly useful to the particular profession. In addition, there is a <strong>general list</strong> of proficiencies, which represent trade skills and knowledge that is widely available to all. Characters will learn proficiencies from both lists over time.</p>

<h2>Types of Proficiencies</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>General Proficiencies:</strong> Trade skills and knowledge available to all characters</li>
<li><strong>Class Proficiencies:</strong> Specialized training useful to specific character classes</li>
<li><strong>Combat Proficiencies:</strong> Fighting styles and weapon specializations</li>
</ul>

<h2>Proficiency Throws</h2>
<p>Most proficiencies require proficiency throws to determine success. Unless otherwise noted, all proficiency throws use 1d20 and have a default target value that can be modified by circumstances, equipment, and character level.</p>

<h2>Multiple Ranks</h2>
<p>Unless its description says otherwise, a proficiency may only be selected once. If a general proficiency can be selected more than once, then the target value required for success is reduced by 4 each time the proficiency is selected. Some proficiencies may offer additional benefits if taken multiple times.</p>`

    {
      id: 'starting-proficiencies', 
      title: 'Starting Proficiencies',
      level: 2,
      content: `<h1>Starting Proficiencies</h1>

<p>All characters begin with the <strong>Adventuring proficiency</strong> as well as one proficiency chosen from their class list and one proficiency chosen from the general list. Characters with an Intellect bonus may choose to begin the game knowing one or more additional proficiencies from the general list. The number of additional general proficiencies that may be learned is equal to their Intellect bonus (+1, +2, or +3).</p>

<p>The player can choose to leave one or more bonus proficiency "slots" open, to be filled during play as circumstances suggest appropriate choices. However, bonus proficiencies from high Intellect can only be used to select proficiencies from the general list.</p>

<h2>The Adventuring Proficiency</h2>
<p>The Adventuring proficiency grants your character the ability to do the following defined activities:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bash down stuck doors</strong> as a combat action by succeeding on a Dungeonbashing proficiency throw of 18+</li>
<li><strong>Climb easy-to-scale obstacles</strong> such as ropes or branchy trees by succeeding on a Climbing proficiency throw of 8+</li>
<li><strong>Methodically search</strong> for concealed traps, secret doors, buried treasure, and other hidden features by spending one turn (10 minutes) and succeeding on a Searching proficiency throw of 18+</li>
<li><strong>Methodically disarm traps</strong> by spending one turn (10 minutes) and succeeding on a Trapbreaking proficiency throw of 18+</li>
<li><strong>Pause and listen for noises</strong> by spending one round and succeeding on a Listening proficiency throw of 18+</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Note:</em> Apply 4x your character's STR bonus or penalty to Dungeon Bashing throws, e.g. you adjust the target value by Â±4/8/12.</p>

<h2>Overlapping Proficiencies</h2>
<p>Some proficiencies appear on both the general list and the class lists. For example, Military Strategy appears on both the general list and the fighter class list. This is because Military Strategy is both a common trade skill (general list) and specialized training that is useful to fighters (class list).</p>`
    },
    {
      id: 'gaining-proficiencies',
      title: 'Gaining Proficiencies',
      level: 2,
      content: `<h1>Gaining Proficiencies</h1>

<p>All characters may choose one additional proficiency from the general list at levels 5, 9, and (if maximum level permits) 13. Characters may choose one additional proficiency from their class list each time they complete a full (two point) saving throw progression.</p>

<h2>Proficiency Limitations</h2>
<p>The Judge may impose limitations on the selection of certain proficiencies depending on his campaign or setting. Otherwise, characters may take any proficiency on the appropriate list.</p>

<h2>Gaining Proficiencies by Time and Training (Optional)</h2>
<p>In addition to their starting and level-based proficiencies, all characters have four "implicit" general proficiency slots which represent their potential for natural accretion of knowledge over time. Characters who are not exceptionally diligent at practice automatically fill these slots after 5, 15, 35, and 70 years of work. This is how 0th level NPCs gain proficiencies without adventuring.</p>

<p>As an optional rule, the Judge can permit adventurers to accelerate their acquisition of these proficiency slots by deliberately training:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>60 days (2 months)</strong> of dedicated activity of training grants the first rank of one general proficiency</li>
<li><strong>240 days (8 months)</strong> of dedicated activity of training grants the second rank or the first rank of a second proficiency</li>
</ul>

<p>The Judge determines the availability of training, instructors, and costs based on the campaign setting and character location.</p>`
