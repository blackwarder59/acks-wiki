## Character Templates and Intellect Scores

In building the character class templates, we assumed that the character had an Intellect score of 12 or less. If your character has an INT score of 13 – 15, you should select one additional general proficiency on top of those listed for the template. If your character has an INT of 16 – 17, you should select two additional general proficiencies. If your character has an INT of 18, you should select three additional general proficiencies. It’s helpful to select proficiencies that complement the template, but you are free to choose any general proficiency you’d like (unless the Judge rules otherwise).

EXAMPLE: Jim has created an assassin with INT 16. The assassin’s template is Infiltrator, so he begins with the Skulking and Disguise proficiencies. Since the assassin has an INT of 16, Jim gets to select an additional two general proficiencies. Reviewing the list of general proficiencies, he decides on Mimicry and Performance (Acting).

### Intellect Scores of Studious Spellcasters

Dwarven craftpriests, elven nightblades, elven spellswords, mages, Nobiran wonderworkers, witches, and Zaharan ruinguards are a type of character known as **studious spellcasters.** Studious spellcasters tend to have higher than average Intellect scores. Therefore, the templates for these classes assume that the character has an INT attribute of between 13 and 15, qualifying him for one bonus proficiency and one bonus spell known in his repertoire. The bonus proficiency that each arcane spellcasting template begins with is noted in bold, while the bonus spell is listed second in the description of the caster’s spellbook.

If a studious spellcaster is created with an INT of 12 or less, then the template actually has more proficiencies and spells than the character is eligible to possess. In this case, you must delete the third listed proficiency and the second listed spell from the template.

EXAMPLE: Jim creates a mage with an INT of 11. The mage’s template is warmage. The listed proficiencies for the warmage are Battle Magic, Military Strategy, and Siege Engineering, while the listed spells are *slicing**blow*and *arcane**armor*. Because Jim’s mage only has INT 11, he loses the Siege Engineering proficiency and the *arcane**armor*spell.

On the other hand, if you create a studious spellcaster has an INT of 16 – 17, you should select one additional general proficiency and one additional spell. If you roll up a studious spellcaster with an INT of 18, you should select two additional general proficiencies and two additional spells. Additional spells should be selected according to the rules for **Starting Spell Repertoires** (p. XX).
