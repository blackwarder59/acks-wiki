## Invading, Conquering, Occupying, and Pillaging Domains

When an army moves into a domain controlled by another leader without his permission, the army is considered to have **invaded** the domain. Invading a domain is the first step towards **occupying, conquering**, and/or **pillaging** it.

When a domain is invaded, it must make an immediate domain morale roll (p. XX). Remember that only that portion of the garrison that is physically present in the domain counts for morale purposes in such cases. If the garrison is off campaigning, this will be detrimental to the domain’s morale. On the other hand, if there is a friendly army from the same realm within the domain, it will count as a garrison for the invaded domain, even if it is not directly under control of the domain’s ruler.

### Occupying Domains

An army has **occupied** a domain when the number of invading troops is sufficiently large enough to constitute an effective garrison without a morale penalty. Large, heavily populated domains are more difficult to occupy than thinly populated ones, although civilized peasants do tend to be more docile than those on the borders.

To determine whether a domain is occupied, calculate the value (in wages/month) of the occupying troops in the domain, and subtract the value (in wages/month) of any of the defending garrison remaining in the domain after any battles have been fought. Divide the difference by the number of peasant families to calculate the **net gp value** of occupying troops per peasant. If the net gp value of occupying troops per peasant is greater than the domain’s garrison cost (2 – 4gp), the domain is occupied. Effectively, if the enemy troops, less any friendly troops, would be enough to garrison the domain without a morale penalty, the domain is occupied.

EXAMPLE: Marcus invades the civilized domain of Sarotem, a small, civilized barony with 500 peasant families. Marcus’s army consists of 100 heavy cavalry (6,000gp wages/month). The domain is only defended with 200 light infantry (1,200gp wages/month). The net gp value of occupying troops per family is (6,000 – 1,200 / 500) is 9.6gp. Marcus has occupied the domain, because 9.6gp exceeds 2gp, the domain’s garrison cost.

Once a domain has been occupied, control over its peasant families and their revenues passes to the occupier, as does responsibility for garrisoning the domain and paying expenses (although tribute will go to the occupier’s lord, not the owner’s lord). Control over urban families does not pass to the occupier until the domain is conquered.

The Judge will calculate a new base morale score for the domain based on the occupier’s personal authority, alignment, garrison, etc. The occupying ruler suffers a penalty to the domain’s current morale score until he conquers the domain. The penalty is equal to the current morale score of the prior ruler at the time of occupation, with a minimum penalty of -1. Should an occupied domain become Turbulent, Defiant, or Rebellious towards the occupier, the rebel peasants will fight to restore the “rightful” owner.

If the owner is able to end the occupation before the domain is conquered, he resumes control over it with the current morale score it had when he last ruled. However, his next domain morale roll suffers a penalty of -1 per month of occupation.

### Conquering Domains

An occupied domain is **conquered** when all strongholds and settlements within it have been captured. A stronghold or settlement is captured when no opposing units are present within. Ungarrisoned strongholds or urban settlements can thus be captured automatically. However, if the strongholds or settlements are garrisoned by troops, then the invading army must besiege them. See Chapter 12, **Sieges**.

When a leader conquers a domain, he can add it to his personal domain if his personal domain is not yet at maximum size. Alternatively the newly conquered domain can be added to the conqueror’s realm, to be ruled by a vassal (or sub-vassal), or can be pillaged (or both). It can even be pillaged until nothing remains…

### Pillaging Domains

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Domain Pillaging Requirements** | | |
| **Domain Size** | **Army**  **Required** | **Time**  **Required** |
| 1 – 500 families | 600 troops | 1 day |
| 501 – 2,500 families | 2,400 troops | 1d3 days |
| 2,501 – 7,500 families | 7,200 troops | 1d4 days |
| 7,500 – 12,500 families | 12,000 troops | 1d6 days |
| 12,501+ families | 24,000 troops | 1d8 days |

Instead of or before integrating a conquered domain into his realm, a leader can **pillage** it. Pillaging a domain requires a sizable force and can take up to a week, but can be exceptionally profitable. See the Domain Pillaging Requirements table for the army size and time required to pillage a domain.

Pillaging a domain yields gold pieces, supplies, and prisoners. Prisoners can be kept as conscript labor, or ransomed or sold for 40gp each. When a domain is pillaged, its population (in families) and its stronghold value or urban investment are reduced. See the Results of Pillaging table, below.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Results of Pillaging** | |
| Gold Plundered | 3d6gp per family |
| Supplies Looted | 1d10 x 5gp per family |
| Prisoners Taken | 1d10 per 10 families |
| Families Lost | 1d10 per 10 families |
| Stronghold Reduction | 1gp per 1gp plundered |

EXAMPLE: Marcus orders his army to pillage the domain. Since Sarotem has 500 families, it takes 1 day to pillage. Marcus plunders 3d6 gp per family; rolling a 13, Marcus plunders (13 x 500) 6,500gp. He loots 1d10 x 5gp in supplies per family; rolling a 5, he loots (5 x 5 x 500) 12,500gp in supplies. He takes 1d10 prisoners per 10 families; rolling a 4, Marcus captures (4 x 500 / 10) 200 prisoners. He ransoms the prisoners off for 40gp each (8,000gp). The total yield from pillaging Sarotem is (6,500 + 12,500 + 8,000) 27,000gp.

If, after pillaging, the remaining stronghold value or urban investment value is too low to sustain the domain’s remaining population, it will lose any excess population when the pillaging ends. A pillaged domain must also make an immediate domain morale roll with a -4 penalty.

EXAMPLE: Sarotem’s population is reduced by 1d10 per 10 families. The 1d10 roll is a 4, so Sarotem loses (4 x 500 / 10) 200 families. It has 300 families remaining. The gp value of Sarotem’s stronghold is also reduced by 6,500gp, the amount of gp plundered. If Sarotem’s stronghold was only 10,000gp to begin with, it would be down to 3,500gp, barely large enough to secure 4 square miles. A 4 square mile domain cannot sustain more than 100 families. The excess 200 families would flee Sarotem when the pillaging was over. (They’d prefer to flee before then, but the presence of the enemy army at their gates makes this hard!)

A domain can be pillaged repeatedly. Each time the effects of the Results of Pillaging table should be applied based on the current size of the domain. Pillaging a domain until nothing remains (“salting the earth”) takes four times the required time, while yielding 20gp in plunder, 50gp in supplies, and 1 prisoner per family in total. The domain is then destroyed and cannot be looted any further.

EXAMPLE: Marcus marches on to Luseatum, a 600 family domain that had rebelled against his authority. He decides to make an example of the domain, and “salts the earth”. After 1d3 x 4 days, Luseatum yields 12,000gp in plunder, 30,000gp in supplies, and 600 prisoners. The domain is destroyed. Future generations use the destruction of Luseatum as a parable against rebellion.

An army too small to pillage a domain can still enjoy some plunder; it just doesn’t do a proper job of it. Roll on the Results of Pillaging table normally, but the gp plundered, supplies looted, and prisoners taken are multiplied by the ratio of units available to units required. Pillaging with a small force still takes the normal time required.

EXAMPLE: 600 orcs are lucky enough to find an unprotected domain with 2,000 families. According to the Domain Pillaging Requirements table, it takes 2400 troops to pillage the domain, but the 600 orcs try anyway! They spend 1d3 days wreaking havoc and then roll on the Results of Pillaging table. The roll yields 20,000gp in plunder, 50,000gp in supplies, and 800 prisoners, which is reduced to (600/2400 = 25%) 5,000gp in plunder, 12,500gp in supplies, and 200 prisoners. Having acquired about 40gp each, the orcs feel rich!

An army that is pillaging a domain cannot move. It can be attacked by an opposing army that moves into the hex it is pillaging. If it is interrupted prior to the completion of pillaging, some pillaging will still have occurred. Again, roll on the Results of Pillaging table normally, but the gp plundered, supplies looted, and prisoners taken is multiplied by the ratio of time spent pillaging to time required. (If a pillaging army is both small and limited in time, then the plunder, loot, and supplies acquired will be reduced proportionately based on both the size of the force and the time spent pillaging.)

Gold and prisoners plundered from pillaging count as **spoils of war** (p. XX) for purposes of experience points. Supplies looted do not count as spoils of war.

### Handling Very Small or Large Domains and Urban Settlements

If a single hex has a mix of small domains with small urban settlements (Class V or Class VI), the Judge should sum the number of families into one value and treat them as a single domain for purposes of invasion, occupation, conquest, and pillage. On the other hand, urban settlements of Class IV or higher should be considered separate domains for purposes of invasion, occupation, conquest, and pillage.

### Pillaging Supply Bases

When the domain or settlement being pillaged is functioning as a supply base, it will yield more than the standard gold, supplies, and prisoners. The pillaging army will gain additional gold equal to one month’s wages for the opposing army, and additional supplies equal to one month’s supply cost for the opposing army.

|  |
| --- |
| The rules assume that gold and supplies are being cached at the supply base in advance and then brought forward to the front line when the troops are fed and paid. The Judge should use his judgment to adjust these rules if the situation does not fit these assumptions. |

EXAMPLE: Marcus pillages the supply base of his arch-rival Moruvai. Moruvai’s army consists of 4 units of goblin wolf riders (900gp wages/month and 3,840gp supplies/month per unit), 5 units of hobgoblin heavy infantry (1,440gp wages/month and 240gp supplies/month per unit), and 5 units of goblin slingers (240gp wages/month and 240gp supplies/month per unit).

Moruvai’s wage cost is [(4 x 900gp) + (5 x 1,440gp) + (5 x 240gp)] 11,800gp per month. Moruvai’s supply cost is [(4 x 3,840gp) + (5 x 240gp) + (5 x 240gp)] 17,760 per month. Therefore Marcus will net 17,760gp in supplies and 11,800gp in gold from pillaging Moruvai’s base.

When an army’s supply base is pillaged, its wages and supply costs for the next month are doubled as its leader must pay for the lost resources. The sack of the supply base counts as a calamity for morale purposes!
