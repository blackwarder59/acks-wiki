# Appendix C: Wounds and Woe

When an unconscious combatant’s wounds are treated, roll 1d20 and 1d6 on the **Mortal Wounds** table for the type of damage that felled it. (For piercing or slashing damage dealt by natural weapons, use the **Permanent Wounds – Savage** table.) Apply the modifiers listed below to the d20 roll. The modified 1d20 roll determines the unconscious combatant’s condition while the modified 1d6 roll determines the **permanent wound** the creature suffers, if any.

* *Combatant’s Constitution:* ± CON modifier of unconscious creature
* *Combatant’s Equipment:* +2 if wearing heavy helm
* *Combatant’s Hit Dice Value:* +2 if d6 HD; +4 if d8 HD; +6 if d10 HD; +8 if d12 HD
* *Combatant’s Hit Points:* +5 if hp are exactly 0; -2 if hp are at negative value from ¼ to ½ max hp; -5 if hp are at negative value from -½ to max hp; -10 if hp are at negative value from max to 2x max hp; -20 if hp are at negative value greater than 2x max hp
* *Ally’s Healing Magic:* +1 per level of healing magic applied to unconscious creature; +1/2 class level if laying on hands
* *Ally’s Healing Proficiency:* +1 per rank of Healing proficiency
* *Ally’s Healing Herbs:* +2 if Horsetail applied
* *Necromantic Magic:* -1/2 spell level if roll triggered by necromantic magic
* *Treatment Timing:* +2 if treated within 1 round of injury; -3 if treated within 1 turn of injury; -5 if treated within 1 hour of injury; -8 if treated within 1 day of injury; -10 if treated more than 1 day after injury

When a permanently wounded or dead creature is healed with *repair disfigurement and disability* or *restore life and limb*, the creature rolls 1d20 and 1d6 on the **Tampering with Mortality** table for his alignment and applies the modifiers listed below. The resulting side effects are permanent and can only be removed with a *miracle* or *wish*.

* *Span of Creature’s Life:* +2 if creature is youthful; 0 if creature is adult; -5 if creature is middle aged; -10 if creature is old; -20 if creature is ancient
* *Spellcaster’s Power:* +½ level of spellcaster casting spell; +2 if cast in temple of spellcaster’s god
* *State of the Creature’s Body:* -10 if creature instantly killed; -5 per spine severing; -2 per limb destroyed; -1 per each hand/foot/ear/eye/tongue/genitalia destroyed; +5 if creature still alive
* *State of the Creature’s Soul:* ±WIL modifier of creature; -1 for each full day since death; -1 for each side effect already suffered

A creature is considered to be instantly killed if it died from disease or poison, was slain while helpless, or rolled an “instantly killed” result on the Mortal Wounds table. The maximum penalty for state of the creature’s body is -10.

### Scarring

The most common permanent wound is scarring. Scarring can be minor, notable, or gruesome. Minor scarring has no game effect, but if a character suffers minor scarring three times, he becomes notably scarred. Being notably scarred imposes a -2 to throws to impersonate another character. If a character suffers notable scarring three times, he becomes gruesomely scarred. Gruesome scarring grants a +1 bonus to intimidate others, but makes it impossible to impersonate another character and imposes a -2 penalty to all other reaction rolls.

### Other Permanent Wounds and Side Effects

Permanent wounds and side effects, can reduce attributes, reduce movement rate, impose penalties to certain throws or rolls, impose conditions (such as **blinded**, **mute**, or **paralyzed**), limit the character’s ability to undertake certain activities (such as using the two-handed weapon fighting style or force marching), or even cause death over time. The effects of all permanent wounds and side effects are cumulative. There are no mundane ways to cure permanent wounds or side effects, but some effects can be temporarily suppressed with healing herbs.

When a creature loses a body part, the Judge will determine whether the left or right part is lost based on the circumstances. For instance, if a creature, equipped with a sword in its right hand and shield in its left, is attacked from its right flank and has its hand chopped off, the Judge would rule that it lost its right hand. If the circumstances do not suggest one or the other side to be more likely, the Judge will roll 1d6; 1 – 3 it’s the right side, 4 – 6 it’s the left side.
