# Crusader

Key Attribute: WIS

Hit Dice: 1d8

Maximum Level: 14

Crusaders are clerics and priests, devoted servants of their gods. Also known as paladins or templars, crusaders are blessed by their deities with the power to heal wounds and drive away the undead. At high levels, they can cast divine spells. A crusader might be a legate of the Auran Church of the Unconquered Sun, a dark priest of Set from the black pyramids of Khemi, or a champion of a barbarian thunder god from the ice-bound north.

## Combat Characteristics

Crusaders are the most heavily armored of the four core classes, and are nearly as skilled in combat as fighters. However, they are somewhat limited in their choice of weapons.

**Combat Proficiencies:** Crusaders have weapon proficiency with axes, clubs, flails, maces, mauls, staffs, swords, warhammers, whips, and all missile weapons. They have armor proficiency with light, medium, and heavy armor. They have fighting style proficiency with the weapon and shield style but not the dual weapon or two-handed weapon styles.

**Combat Progression:** Crusaders advance in attack throws and saving throws by two points every three levels of experience. They do not gain any bonus to damage as they advance in level. They can cleave after killing a foe a maximum of once per round per every two class levels (rounded down).

## Starting Class Powers

At the start of play, crusaders have the following class powers.

**Divine Vocation:** The crusader has been called to serve a deity (or a pantheon of closely related deities) as a cleric or priest. He can begin play as a member of a religious hierarchy (Judge's discretion). He can automatically recognize and identify religious symbols, rituals, and artifacts of his own faith, and can recognize those of other faiths with a proficiency throw of 11+. Secret, rare, or heretical cults might be harder to recognize. (This class power is equivalent to one rank of Theology proficiency.)

**Faith Healing:** A crusader with 13+ Wisdom can heal others with divine power. The target must be of the same faith as the crusader. The crusader can heal a number of hit points equal to his class level each day. This healing can be spread among multiple targets. He can heal a particular character no more than once per day. Each act of healing requires one round and the crusader to touch the target. Faith healing can neutralize poison if used within one turn of poisoning, but this counts as healing hit points equal to the crusader's level toward the crusader's daily limit.

**Laying on Hands:** Crusaders are blessed with the power to heal themselves through divine magic. Each day, a crusader can heal a number of his own hit points equal to twice his class level by laying hands on himself (his own body). Each act of healing requires one round. Laying on hands can also neutralize poison affecting the crusader if used within one turn of poisoning, but this counts as healing hit points equal to twice the crusader's level.

**Protection from Evil:** The very presence of a crusader makes it more difficult for enchanted creatures to cause harm. All allies within 10' of the crusader (including the crusader himself) gain a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws against attacks and effects from chaotic creatures, and against charm, command, or other enchantment effects. At 3rd level, the protection improves to a +2 bonus.

**Stronghold:** At 9th level, a crusader can establish a **stronghold**. This stronghold will typically be a fortified temple, monastery, or abbey, and will be defended by a military order of loyal crusaders. Once he has established his stronghold, the crusader will be considered to have founded a chapter of his faith in the region. Additional rules for strongholds are detailed in the **Campaigns** chapter (p. XX).

**Turn Unholy:** Crusaders can turn undead creatures, causing them to flee or even destroying them outright. To make a turning attempt, the player rolls 2d6 and adds the crusader's level, then consults the Turn Unholy table. The numbers shown are the minimum die result needed to turn or destroy undead of that Hit Die. Results of "T" indicate the undead are automatically turned, and results of "D" indicate that the undead are automatically destroyed. If the attempt succeeds, the crusader affects 2d6 HD of undead. Undead of 4 HD or fewer are affected first. A crusader can attempt to turn undead once per combat round by brandishing a holy symbol and uttering maledictions. There is no limit to the number of turning attempts that can be made in a day.

**Wisdom Bonus Spells:** Crusaders with high Wisdom can cast additional divine spells above and beyond those given by their level. The number of bonus spells, and the levels at which they can be cast, are shown in the Wisdom table (p. XX). These spells are in addition to those shown on the Crusader Spell Progression table.

## Additional Class Powers

When they advance in level, crusaders gain the following additional class powers:

**Divine Magic (2nd level):** Beginning at 2nd level, crusaders can learn and cast divine spells. The number and levels of spells the crusader can cast each day are listed on the Crusader Spell Progression table. Each day, the crusader prays for his spells, choosing any spells from the divine spell list up to the maximum level and number allowed by his level. Unlike mages, crusaders have access to their entire spell list and do not need to find spell books or choose a limited repertoire of spells to cast.

**Minor Divine Research (7th level):** The crusader can research divine spells, scribe magical scrolls, and brew potions. Rules for magic research can be found in the **Campaigns** chapter (p. XX).

**Major Divine Research (9th level):** The crusader can create more powerful magic items such as weapons, rings, and staffs.

**Supreme Divine Research (11th level):** The crusader can learn and cast ritual divine spells of great power (7th, 8th, and 9th level), craft magical constructs, and create magical crossbreeds.
