Fighters are experts in the arts of combat and war. In the Auran Empire, fighters might have learned their arts as legionaries or cataphracts in the Imperial Army, gladiators battling for glory in the arena, raiders off the Jutland coast, or sell-swords in the games of the noble houses.

## Combat Characteristics

As their name suggests, fighters are exceptionally skilled combatants. No other class is as broadly trained in the arts of combat.

**Combat Proficiencies:** Fighters have weapon proficiency with all weapons, armor proficiency with all armor, and fighting style proficiency with all three optional styles (i.e. the dual weapon, two-handed weapon, and weaponand shield styles).

**Combat Progression:** Fighters advance in attack throws and saving throws by two points every three levels of experience. They increase their base damage roll from successful missile and melee attacks by +1 at 1st level, and by an additional +1 at 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th level. They can cleave after killing a foe a maximum of once per round per class level.

## Starting Class Powers

At the start of play, fighters have the following class power:

**Manual of Arms:** The fighter is highly experienced in military discipline, physical fitness, and weapon drill. He can automatically identify the battle standards, equipment, great captains, military slang, and rank insignia of his homeland. He can identify those of other realms with a proficiency throw of 11+. He can fight as a regular (rather than irregular) in formed and loose units. He can begin play as a member of a legion, mercenary's guild, or other military organization (Judge's discretion). (This class power is equivalent to one rank of Manual of Arms proficiency.)

## Additional Class Powers

When they advance in level, fighters gain the following additional class powers:

**Battlefield Prowess (5th level):** The fighter's presence inspires troops he leads. Any henchmen and mercenaries hired by the fighter gain a +1 bonus to their morale score whenever he personally leads them. This bonus stacks with any modifiers from the fighter's Charisma or proficiencies.

**Castle (9th level):** By acquiring a **castle** or fort worth at least 15,000gp, the fighter can attract followers to his service. 5d6 x 10 0th level troops and 1d6 fighters of 1st – 3rd level arrive to serve him within 1d3 months of him acquiring the castle. If the fighter already has a castle, the followers arrive to serve him within 1d3 months of him reaching 9th level. The fighter must pay his followers the ordinary rates for mercenaries and henchmen or they leave his service. In time, the fighter might become a great lord, commanding armies to conquer vast realms. Additional rules for castles are detailed in the **Campaigns** chapter (p. XX).

## Class Proficiencies

**Proficiency Progression:** At 1st level, fighters select one class proficiency from their class proficiency list and one general proficiency from the general proficiency list. They select an additional class proficiency at 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th level. They select an additional general proficiency at 5th, 9th, and 13th level.

**Fighter Proficiency List:** Acrobatics, Alertness, Berserkergang, Blind Fighting, Combat Ferocity, Combat Reflexes, Combat Trickery (disarm, force back, knock down, overrun, sunder), Command, Dungeonbashing Expertise, Fighting Style Specialization, Intimidation, Leadership, Manual of Arms, Military Strategy, Mounted Combat, Precise Shooting, Riding, Running, Siege Engineering, Skirmishing, Swashbuckling, Unarmed Fighting, Weapon Finesse, Weapon Focus
