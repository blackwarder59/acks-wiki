## Combat

When adventurers have an encounter with monsters, it often results in **combat**. Participants in combat are called **combatants**. Using the following rules, you can resolve combat between scores of combatants. For larger scale battles with hundreds to thousands of combatants, see p. XX.

### Simulating Combat on the Battlemap

Combat in ***ACKS II***can be enjoyed as a tactical wargame on a battlemap (analog or virtual) with counters, figures, or tokens to represent the exact position of the combatants throughout the combat, or purely in the imagination via the “theater of the mind.” The following rules introduce certain concepts that are useful for tactical simulation on the battlemap.

For groups who prefer a more narrative experience, or who want to de-emphasize combat in favor of exploration and campaign activities, ***ACKS II***can easily be run using the “theater of the mind.” (We do it a lot, especially for small fights.) When running theater of the mind, it’s the Judge’s responsibility to track the location of the various combatants and to decide which are affected by spells, which are in range of missile fire, and so on. He also must decide how many attackers can strike at one opponent based on the terrain and positioning of the combatants, when an opponent is approaching from the rear, and other factors. Groups that prefer to fight combat in the theater of mind can skip this section of the rules.

###### Square Scale

Each square on the battlemap represent a 5’ x 5’ area. (When measuring along diagonals, count every two squares as 15’.) This is the ideal scale for ***ACKS II****,* because being within 5’ of an enemy can trigger the **engaged** condition (p. XX). A combatant in a square adjacent to the front of an enemy combatant will generally be engaged with that enemy.

###### ![](data:image/png;base64...)Combatant Frontage and Interval

By tradition, the miniatures and virtual tokens typically used for man-sized combatants occupy a 5’ x 5’ square on the battlemap. However, a 5’ frontage is considerably larger than most historical combatants occupied in battle. In actuality, a man-sized combatant armed with a large bludgeoning or slashing weapon requires a full 5’ square frontage, but a man-sized combatant armed with a small or medium weapon or piercing weapon only requires a 3’ frontage. Therefore, ***ACKS II***permits three such combatants to fight in formation along two adjacent 5’ squares. To represent this on the battlemap, place one combatant’s figure in one square, the second combatant’s figure in the other square, and the third combatant’s figure on the line between the two, as shown in the adjoining image.

![](data:image/png;base64...)Likewise, a 5’ interval between troops is considerably greater than many historical combat formations used. Man-sized combatants can actually organize into ranks at 3’ intervals. This narrow interval enables combatants in the second rank equipped with polearms or spears.to attack opponents in the enemy formation. Therefore, ***ACKS II***permits up to three ranks of man-sized combatants per 10’. To represent this on the battlemap, place a second-rank combatant’s figure so that its base is overlapping the base of the figure to its front. A second-rank combatant armed with a long weapon can then attack targets as if it were occupying the space of the figure to its front.

Small combatants occupy the same space on the battlemap as man-sized combatants (one 5’ x 5’ square). Tiny combatants are typically represented on the battlemap as swarms rather than as individual creatures. The ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual*** has rules for swarms.

Large, huge, gigantic, and colossal targets occupy more spaces on the battlemap. By default, large creatures take up 2 squares (2 x 1 or 1 x 2), huge creatures take up 4 squares (2 x 2), gigantic creatures take up 12 squares (4 x 3 or 3 x 4) and colossal creatures take up 60 squares or more (10 x 6 or 6 x 10). The image below shows the default space requirements for each size of combatant. The Judge can adjust these at his discretion depending on the creature’s actual length and width, body posture, the combat situation, etc. Sizes are listed for each monster in its entry in the ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual****.*

![](data:image/png;base64...)

###### Facing, Field of View and Line of Sight

Each combatant on the battlemap has a **facing**, which represents its directional orientation, and a **field of view**, which represents the arc on the battlemap within which it can claim **line of sight** on other combatants. A combatant’s facing determines its **flanks** and **rear**, as shown on the image below. (Combatants larger than man-sized have the same facings, simply extending their front and rear squares by their frontage and their flanks by their depth.) A combatant’s field of view encompasses only his front and flank squares. Therefore, he does not have line of sight on units approaching from his rear, which can leave him **vulnerable** to certain attacks.

![](data:image/png;base64...)

###### Passage of Lines

A man-sized combatant can move through a space occupied by an ally or between spaces occupied by two adjacent allies. However, a man-sized combatant cannot move through two spaces occupied by three adjacent allies. The tight 3’ wide frontage prevents passage of lines. This forces combatants to decide if they want a looser battle line that permits traverse or a tighter formation that puts more fighting power per square.

A combatant larger than man-sized can move through spaces occupied by allies at least two size categories smaller, provided there are enough contiguous unoccupied spaces to accommodate at least one-half the combatant’s frontage. A combatant larger than man-sized can end its movement “overlapping” with allies provided there are enough unoccupied spaces to accommodate at least one-half of its base.

![](data:image/png;base64...)

EXAMPLE: Orm is an ancient dragon of colossal size with a frontage of 6 squares. A number of his orc minions have taken up positions in front of him (as shown on the adjoining image). Orm can move through the first rank of orcs, because there are at least 3 empty spaces, but not through the second rank. He can end his initiative overlapping with the orcs because at least one-half his base is in empty spaces.

### Round and Initiative

Combat is resolved in a series of sequential units of time called **rounds**. A round is a brief interval of time in which flurries of activity are punctuated by pauses and lulls. It can be as brief as 10 – 15 seconds and as long as a minute or two. During each round, each combatant gets an **initiative segment** (usually just called the combatant’s “initiative”)**,** during which he has an opportunity to take one or more actions. Thus a round consists of several initiative segments, while an entire combat might consist of several rounds.

### Round Sequence

During each round, gameplay proceeds through the following steps.

1. **Pre-Initiative Declarations.** Combatants wishing to cast spells or engage in **defensive movement** (i.e. undertake the retreat or withdraw actions) in the upcoming round must publicly inform the Judge before the initiative dice are rolled. Other actions do not have to be declared in advance.
2. **Initiative Rolls.** After pre-initiative declarations, each combatant rolls 1d6 to determine his **initiative number**. This roll can be adjusted by the combatant’s DEX modifier, if any, and by certain special abilities or proficiencies. In larger combats, the Judge might roll 1d6 for each party-sized group of identical monsters instead of for each individual monster. Initiative number determines when a combatant acts during the round.
3. **Initiative Count.** The Judge begins calling out the initiative numbers starting with 10, then 9, then 8, and so on. Each combatant takes his initiative segmentwhen his initiative number is called. The initiative count continues until characters have acted or until it reaches -10, at which point the initiative count ends.
4. **Morale.** When the initiative count concludes, the Judge checks morale for any combatants who have suffered enough damage and/or lost enough allies that they might withdraw or flee. If all combatants on one side have been defeated, the combat ends. Otherwise another round begins.

###### Acting Before Initiative Number

There are three circumstances during which a combatant can act before his initiative number:

* **Readied to Attack:** If a combatant begins the round with a readied combat action (p. XX), he can take his readied combat action when it is triggered, regardless of his own initiative number. A readied combat action takes place at the end of the movement actions of the opponent that triggered his readied action, or at the last point of their movement where the opponent would disappear from view, beforehis combat action. A combatant who takes a readied combat action can act normally when his initiative segment occurs later in that round.
* **Readied Missile Weapon on First Round:** If, at the start of the first round of combat, a combatant was unengaged, had a missile weapon equipped, and was not surprised, he can interrupt to fire at a charging opponent on the charging opponent’s initiative number regardless of his own initiative number, as if he were readied. The combatant’s attack takes place just before the charging opponent’s attack. The combatant loses his initiative number whether or not his attack hits. However, the combatant can cleave after the attack (p. XX) if it kills his opponent.
* **Readied Long Melee Weapon on First Round** If, at the start of the first round of combat, a combatant was unengaged, had a long melee weapon equipped, and was not surprised, he can interrupt to attack at a charging opponent on the charging opponent’s initiative number regardless of his own initiative number, as if he were readied. The combatant’s attack takes place just before the charging opponent’s attack. The combatant cannot interrupt the charging opponent if it is of a bigger size category or is also equipped with a long melee weapon. The combatant loses his initiative number whether or not his attack hits. However, the combatant can cleave after the attack (p. XX) if it kills his opponent.

In all three cases, a combatant who was readied loses his opportunity to act if he takes damage, fails a saving throw, or is involuntarily moved before he uses his readied action.

EXAMPLE: Augilar is equipped with a spear. His comrade Skandara is equipped with a composite bow. They are facing three orcs, two equipped with spears and one with a great axe, all 30’ away. At the start of the first combat round neither Augilar nor Skandara is **engaged** or **surprised**. Augilar’s initiative number is 1, Skandara’s initiative number is 3, and the orcs’ initiative numbers are 4 (axe), 5 (spear), and 6 (spear). On initiative count 6, the first spear-armed orc charges Skandara. Skandara interrupts the orc’s attack to shoot it with her bow. Her attack wounds the orc, which then attacks her and misses. On initiative count 5, the second spear-armed orc charges Augilar. Augilar cannot interrupt because the orc has a spear. Fortunately, it misses. On initiative count 4, the axe-armed orc charges Augilar. Augilar interrupts the orc’s attack to stab it with his spear.

**Designer’s Note:** ***ACKS II*** uses sequential initiative over the course of rounds, rather than a second-by-second adjudication of action. This can create anomalies where a creature charges hundreds of feet across a battlefield into the face of spearmen or archers who just stand there for the greater part of the round. The Readied on First Round rules address this edge case

###### Engagement

A combatant that is facing an opponent within 5’ **engages** that opponent unless either (or both) the combatant and the enemy are hidden from the other or are protected by particular magic that prevents engagement (e.g. *sanctuary*). A combatant treats an enemy that does not engage it as if it were an ally for movement purposes.

EXAMPLE: Augilar, Ravila, and Skandara are 5’ away from an orc. The orc is facing Augilar and Ravila. Augilar is facing the orc, but Ravila has the orc to her rear (i.e. she’s facing the wrong direction). Skandara is facing the orc from the orc’s rear. Ravila is protected by a *sanctuary* spell. Therefore Augilar and Skandara have both engaged the orc. The orc has engaged Augilar. Ravila is not engaged by the orc because of her *sanctuary* spell. The orc is not engaged by Ravila both because it is to her rear and because of her *sanctuary* spell. Skandara is not engaged by the orc because she is to its rear.

Sometimes a combatant might engage an opponent that is not facing it. If the opponent is not already engaged and the combatant is not **sneaking**, the opponent can make a free facing change, turning to face the combatant that just engaged it, before any attack takes place. This permits the opponent to engage the combatant, avoid being **vulnerable** and, possibly, to take a readied action.

Engaged combatants are restricted in the actions they can take. They cannot use a full-round action to charge, run, or running sneak. They cannot use a movement action to march, sneak, stand up, or take cover. They cannot use a combat action to march. Creatures in flight cannot be engaged by creatures incapable of flight.

EXAMPLE: Let’s assume that Ravila were not protected by *sanctuary*. She would be engaged by the orc. Because Ravila is not engaged to her front, she could immediately change her facing to put the orc to her front. The orc cannot change its facing to prevent Skandara from backstabbing it, because the orc is engaged by Augilar.

**Engagement by Smaller or Larger Creatures (optional):** While a man can physically keep another man from passing him, that same man cannot necessarily stop an elephant from moving where it wants. However, a single titan or a phalanx of men might be able to prevent an elephant from passing. When such situations arise, the Engagement by Smaller or Larger Creatures table can be used to decide if a combatant is engaged. It shows the number of opponents of a given size that must be within 5’ of a single creature of a given size in order to engage it. If less than this number are present, the combatant can simply pass through the opponents as if they were allies. However, it cannot end its move overlapping (sharing space) with opponents unless it has some special ability that might permit that. These rules are optional and will be used at the Judge’s discretion when necessary to adjudicate gameplay.

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Engagement by Smaller or Larger Creatures | | | | | | |
| Engaging Creature Size | **Small**  **Opponent** | **Man-Sized**  **Opponent** | **Large**  **Opponent** | **Huge**  **Opponent** | **Gigantic**  **Opponent** | **Colossal**  **Opponent** |
| Small | 1 creature | 1 creature | 2 creatures | 2 creatures | 3 creatures | 4 creatures |
| Man-Sized | 1 creature | 1 creature | 2 creatures | 2 creatures | 3 creatures | 4 creatures |
| Large | 1 creature | 1 creature | 1 creature | 1 creature | 2 creatures | 3 creatures |
| Huge | 1 creature | 1 creature | 1 creature | 1 creature | 1 creature | 2 creatures |
| Gigantic | 1 creature | 1 creature | 1 creature | 1 creature | 1 creature | 2 creatures |
| Colossal | 1 creature | 1 creature | 1 creature | 1 creature | 1 creature | 1 creature |

![](data:image/png;base64...)

EXAMPLE: Orm is an ancient dragon of colossal size with a frontage of 6 squares. He cannot be engaged by less than 4 man-sized creatures. He can thus move through the first rank of legionaries as if they were allies. Once he starts moving over the legionaries he must continue moving so that he does not end his movement overlapping with them. When Orm reaches the second rank of legionaries, he is engaged and his movement ends. Had the second rank of legionaries been closer, Orm would not have been able to pass through the first rank. The image below illustrates the situation.

###### Delaying Actions

On a combatant’s initiative segment, the combatant can choose to **delay** until a lower initiative count, up to a maximum equal to the negative value of his initiative number. For instance, a character with an initiative number of 5 can delay his action until the initiative count reaches -5. If the character does not take his initiative segment at that time, he loses the ability to act that round.

A delaying combatant can take his actions when the count reaches a lower initiative number of his choice, or can wait for another combatant to act. If a combatant waits for a particular character, then the combatant’s action takes place just after that character on the same initiative number.

Effects triggered at the start of a character’s initiative take place before he delays. Effects triggered at the end of a character’s initiative (such as a spell he is casting) take place at the end of his initiative segment, or at the end of the round if he does not ever act.

EXAMPLE: Quintus is currently the victim of a *bloody flux*spell. According to the spell, the victim of this spell takes 1d12 extraordinary necrotic damage and must make a Death saving throw at the start of its initiative. Quintus rolled a 4 for initiative. Balbus, who can dispel *bloody flux,* only rolled a 2. When initiative count of 4 is called, Quintus announces he is delaying until after Balbus acts. Unfortunately, Quintus cannot delay the effect of the spell on him. He takes the damage and must make the Death saving throw, even though he’s not acting yet.

###### Simultaneous Initiative

If two more combatants have the same initiative number, those combatants act sequentially. They do not take their actions simultaneously. If the two combatants are on the same side, they may choose the order they act. If the combatants are on opposite sides, the side with fewer members can have some or all of its combatants act before or after the other side. If the sides have equal numbers of troops, then the side run by the Judge (the monsters) can have some or all of its combatants act before or after the other side.

### Actions

During his initiative segment, each combatant can take one full-round action; two movement actions; or one movement action and one combat action. The combatant must use his movement action before he uses his combat action. He cannot substitute one action for the other, or use the combat action before the movement action.

###### Full Round Actions

Full-round actions include:

**Cast Spell:** Remain stationary and cast a spell either from the caster’s repertoire or from a scroll in hand. The combatant must have declared the spell before initiative. If the combatant takes damage or fails a saving throw at any point during the round before casting, the casting is disrupted. The action and the spell are lost when this occurs.

**Charge:** Charge an opponent in line of sight at up to running speed. The combatant must not be **engaged** at the start of his charge. The charge must be in a straight line towards the intended target and the path to the target must be clear. If the charging combatant does not have line of sight to the opponent at the start of the charge, that opponent can’t be charged. The charging combatant is **disordered** (-2 penalty to AC) until the start of his next initiative. After charging, a combatant can make a melee attack with a +2 bonus on his attack throw on the target he charged and on subsequent cleaves provided he takes a 5’ step after each cleave. Impact weapons, such as spears, lances, and polearms, deal additional damage on a successful charge. The natural attacks of certain monsters sometimes count as impact weapons.

**Don/Remove Armor:** Don or remove 1 stone of armor. This action can be repeated over several rounds to don or remove suits of armor entirely. For instance, it takes 6 full-round actions to don or remove ordinary plate armor.

**Hastily Lockpick:** Attempt to hastily lockpick a door, chest, or other locked object within 5’ of the combatant.

**Hastily Search:** Attempt to hastily search the area within 5’ of the combat, or within 10’ if equipped with a long pole.

**Hastily Trapbreak:** Attempt to hastily disable a trap within 5’ of the combatant.

**Fire/Reload Artillery:** Make an attack with artillery within 5’ or reload artillery that has attacked.

**Run:** Run in a straight line or gradual curve at up to running speed. The combatant must not be **engaged** when he starts running. The running combatant is **disordered** (-2 penalty to AC) until the start of his next initiative. After running, a combatant can take cover if he is not engaged.

**Running Sneak:** Swiftly and sneakily hustle in a straight line or gradual curve at up to running speed. The combatant suffers a -10 penalty to its Sneaking proficiency throw. The combatant must not be **engaged** when it starts sneaking.

**Retreat:** Run away from engaging enemies at up to running speed. The combatant must have begun the round engaged and declared the retreat before rolling initiative unless he has Skirmishing. When the retreat begins, the combatant must change his facing to the desired direction of retreat, and thereafter cannot change his facing during the retreat. While retreating, the combatant can ignore engagement by any enemies that had him engaged at the start of the retreat. However, when his retreat is complete, the combatant must not remain engaged with any of the enemies that he had been engaged with. If the configuration of troops or terrain on the battlefield makes this impossible, then the combatant cannot retreat. A retreating combatant can still engage, and become engaged and forced to halt by, new enemies that he encounters during his retreat. A retreating combatant is **disordered** (-2 penalty to AC) until the start of his next initiative segment. Retreating is a type of defensive movement.

**Spike a Door:** Hammer a spike into a door within 5’ of the combatant.

###### Movement Actions

On its initiative segment, a combatant that did not take a full-round action can take one or two movement actions. If the combatant only takes one movement action, it can then take a combat action afterwards. Movement actions include:

**Action in Lieu of Movement:** Take a simple action requiring a few moments. A combatant can:

* Grab a helpless creature, either completely or just by the limbs, within 5’. The creature’s weight and encumbrance is added to the combatant’s encumbrance if he picks it up entirely. Otherwise half its weight and encumbrance is added to his encumbrance. The creature can be grabbed (and subsequently moved) even if it is engaged by enemies within 5’ provided the combatant is not himself engaged.
* Give a complex or extensive order to a creature or creatures. Simple orders (“protect me!”) do not require an action.
* Light an equipped lantern, torch, or oil flask.
* Mount or dismount a stationary or moving mount or vehicle (if proficient).
* Open an unlocked, unstuck door, or pull aside a curtain.
* Pick an item off the ground and equip it.
* Ready or loosen a shield.
* Retrieve an item from a backpack, rucksack, or sack and equip it. (Retrieving an item from an adventurer’s harness, belt pouch, bowcase, quiver, or sheath does not require an action in lieu of movement.)
* Sheathe a weapon and draw another. (Dropping a weapon rather than sheathing it and drawing a new one does not require an action in lieu of movement.)
* Perform another simple action that the rules or Judge permit.

**March:** Movein any desired direction (including to the flank or rear) at up to combat speed. The combatant can change facing as many times as desired while marching and end facing in any direction. The combatant must not be **engaged** at the start of the march.

**Remain Stationary/Change Facing:** Hold fast, not moving in any direction. A combatant who is remaining stationary can, however, change his facing in order to pick a more advantageous orientation.

**Sneak:** Move in a stealthy manner at up to one-half combat speed, or at combat speed with a -5 penalty on the Sneaking throw. The combatant must be proficient in Sneaking to take this action.

**Stand Up:** Stand up if prone. The combatant must not be **engaged**.

**Take Cover:** Take cover by falling prone, crouching, kneeling, etc. The combatant must not be **engaged**.

**Withdraw:** Move away from engaging enemies at up to half combat speed. The combatant can change facing as many times as desired while withdrawing and can end facing in any direction. While withdrawing, the combatant can ignore engagement by any enemies that had him engaged at the start of the withdrawal. When his withdrawal is complete, the combatant must not remain engaged with any of the enemies that he had been engaged with. If the configuration of troops or terrain on the battlefield makes this impossible, then the combatant cannot withdraw. A withdrawing combatant can still engage, and become **engaged** and forced to halt by, new enemies that he encounters during his withdrawal. To take a withdrawal, the combatant must begin the round engaged and declare the withdrawal before rolling initiative, unless he has Skirmishing. Withdrawal is a type of defensive movement.

###### Combat Actions

On its initiative segment, a combatant that did not take a full-round action or two movement actions can take a combat action.

**Action in Lieu of Attacking:** Take a moderately complex action requiring some interaction with the world or other combatants. With an action in lieu of attacking, a combatant can:

* Apply a healing herb, oil, or salve to himself, a willing or helpless combatant, or an equipped or stationary object.
* Brandish a holy symbol, garlic, or mirror.
* Cast a spell from a rod, staff, wand, or ring.
* Cleanse himself or a willing or helpless combatant of acid or oil by pouring out a waterskin of water.
* Drink a potion or pour a potion down a helpless combatant’s throat.
* Mount or dismount a stationary mount or vehicle.
* Unlock a door using a key.
* Use an equipped item for non-combat purposes.
* Perform an action in lieu of moving (from the list above).
* Perform another moderately complex action that the rules or Judge permit.

**Attack**: Attack one or more times, based on attack sequence. If the combatant remained stationary and is not **engaged**, he may move up to 5’ towards the enemy when he attacks if necessary to engage. Attacking can involve special maneuvers, cleaves, etc.

**Bash**: Bash down a stuck door, lift a portcullis, smash a window, etc. Depending on the action, this might require a Dungeonbashing proficiency throw.

**Defend:** Defend himself or an adjacent character to his rear or offhand flank. If the combatant does not have a shield, he or the target he defends gains a +2 AC against melee attacks. If the combatant has a shield, he or the target he defends gains a +4 AC against missile weapons other than thrown weapons, and a +2 AC against melee attacks and thrown missile attacks, and a +2 bonus on Blast saving throws.. The combatant must not have charged, run, or retreated. A character does not benefit from being defended by two characters from the same facing, but can benefit by being defended to both his front and flanks/rear. The benefits of the Defend action last until the start of the combatant’s next initiative or until the combatant declares he is casting a spell (whichever comes first).

**Escape:** Attempt to end the grabbed, restrained, or wrestled condition. See Escaping (p. XX).

**Hide:** Start hiding in cover or darkness. The combatant must be proficient in Hiding to take this action.

**Listen:** Listen for faint sounds.

**March:** Movein any desired direction (including to the flank or rear) at up to combat speed. The combatant can change facing as many times as desired while marching and end facing in any direction. The combatant must not be **engaged** at the start of the march.

**Ready a Combat or Movement Action:** Get ready to take an action at a later point. The combatant must state the intended action and trigger for taking it. A combatant who has a readied action loses his action if he takes damage, fails a saving throw, or is involuntarily moved before he uses his readied action.

**Rebuke:** Rebuke undead in line of sight.

**Stand Up:** Stand up if prone.

**Take Cover:** Take cover by falling prone, crouching, kneeling, etc.

**Treat Injury**: Treat the injury of an unconscious ally, triggering a roll on the Mortal Wounds table. The combatant can apply a healing herb on the ally, pour a potion down the ally’s throat, use a curative magic item on the ally, or use *lay on hands* on the ally as part of this action in order to grant the ally a bonus to the roll. (Casting a *cure* spell on an unconscious ally requires a full-round action, but also counts as treating the injury.)

**Use Spell-Like Ability:** Use a spell-like ability that is either innately possessed by the combatant or available from an equipped item.

###### Readied Actions

When a combatant readies a combat action, he gives up his ability to take an action on his initiative segment for a chance to do so later in the round. He can interrupt another combatant’s action any time before his next initiative segment to take his readied action. The interruption occurs after the interrupted combatant’s movement action but before the interrupted combatant’s combat action.

**Countercharge:** A readied attack may (but does not have to) be considered a countercharge if the opponent whose action it is interrupting took a charge movement action. If so, the combatant gains a +2 bonus on his attack throw and on subsequent cleaves provided he takes a 5’ step after each cleave, and deals impact damage if eligible to do so. However, the combatant’s AC is reduced by 2 until he takes his next initiative segment.

**Loss of Readied Action:** A combatant who takes damage, fails a saving throw, or is involuntarily moved loses his readied action.

**Readied vs. Readied:** If two combatants both have actions readied and both trigger at the same time, the combatant’s readied actions are resolved in order of their current initiative numbers.

**Staying Ready:** If at the end of a combat round, a character still has a readied action, he retains the readied action and can use it on the subsequent round. Once his initiative number comes up again, he stops being ready, but can still act normally. If he delays his initiative segment, he stops being ready.

**Reserve Standoff:** If an entire combat round passes with no offensive actions made by either side against their opponents, all combatants lose any readied actions. (This is why combatants can never begin combat readied.)

**Readied Attack Against Charge:** A combatant equipped with a polearm, spear or other weapon capable of dealing impact damage who makes a readied attack against a charging opponent deals impact damage. The combatant has “set for the charge” and uses the opponent’s momentum against him. The combatant does not get a +2 bonus to hit nor does he suffer a -2 penalty on his AC. (A combatant who wants the attack throw bonus should use his readied action to countercharge, see above).

### Conducting an Attack

By default, combatants receive one attack from any given combat action or charge action. Through magic such as *swift sword*,some combatants might gain an additional attack on their combat action. Some monsters have **attack sequences,** the most common of which is the claw/claw/bite sequence, which permits three attacks on one combat action. Combatants who kill or incapacitate an opponent with an attack can **cleave** to gain additional attacks (as described below). For combatants with multiple attacks, the cleaves from a successful attack are resolved before proceeding to the next attack in the attack sequence.

Whether or not an attack hits its target is determined with an **attack throw**.The player or Judge rolls 1d20 and applies any modifiers to the roll from high Strength or Dexterity, magic, or special circumstances. The result is compared to the target values listed on the Attack Throw table for the combatant’s class and level or HD. Because well-armored or highly dexterous targets are harder to hit than lightly-armored or sluggish ones, the target’s **Armor Class** is added to the target value necessary to hit it.

If the throw succeeds, the attack hits the target. When a hit is scored, the attacker rolls for damage by weapon type or monster attack, taking into account any bonuses or penalties. If the throw fails, the attack missed the target. (If it missed by less than the target’s AC from armor, the attack bounced off the armor.) As with all throws, an unmodified roll of 20 is always a hit, and an unmodified roll of 1 is always a miss.

EXAMPLE: Marcus is a 10th level fighter with an attack throw of 4+. To hit an unarmored target (AC 0), he only needs to roll a 4 or higher. To hit a plate-armored target (AC 6), he needs to roll a (4+6) = 10 or higher. If he rolled a 3 or less, his attack would be a clean miss. If he rolled a 4 – 9, his attack would still count as a miss, but in the game world he’d have clanged his blade on the plate.

EXAMPLE: A 20 HD bronze golem has an attack throw -10. It attacks an ogre (AC 3). To hit the ogre, it needs to roll a (-10 + 3) = -7 or higher. However, an modified roll of 1 is always a miss, so the golem will need to roll at least a 2 or more. The golem is so powerful that the ogre’s armor is irrelevant to it.

**Elevation and Flanking:** A combatant’s position relative to his target can affect his attack throw. If he is attacking a target at a lower elevation, the target is **subjacent**, granting him a +1 bonus to attack the target. If he is attacking the target from a space on either flank, the target is **flanked**, granting him a +2 bonus to attack the target. If he is attacking the target from its rear, the target is **vulnerable**, granting him a +2 bonus to attack it and to make an ambush or backstab if eligible. The bonus from attacking a subjacent character can stack with the bonus from attacking a flanked and/or vulnerable character, but the bonus from attacking a flanked and vulnerable character cannot stack.

If a monster’s entry includes a hp bonus next to its HD value, round its HD up to the next highest value for purposes of calculating its attack throw value.

EXAMPLE: A hobgoblin has 1+1 HD. It attacks as a 2 HD monster, with a 9+ attack throw.

###### Melee Attacks

Melee attacks can be from swords, axes, spears, or other weapons or from natural weapons such as horns, tusks, and claws. In order to make a melee attack at a particular target, a combatant must be within 5’ of the target and facing him. However, combatants equipped with **long weapons** who are positioned behind and facing an ally can attack targets within 5’ of that ally. This represents the greater reach available to a second-rank combatant with a spear or polearm. Some monsters of great size or with special attacks can make melee attacks at 10’, 20’ or more. A combatant making a melee attack does not need to have line of sight on its target, but if it lacks line of sight it is considered **blind**.

Attack throws and damage rolls with melee attacks are modified by the attacker’s STR modifier and can also be modified by his and/or his target’s weapons, magic items, class powers, proficiencies, and/or conditions.

EXAMPLE: Norden is a 7th level dwarven vaultguard with 16 STR. He is equipped with a **+1 battle axe**and knows the Goblin-Slaying proficiency. He is attacking an orc chieftain with AC 6. Unfortunately, Norden is also **blinded** by evil magic. His attack throw value from his class level is 6+. He gets +2 from his Strength, +2 from Goblin Slaying, +1 for his magic axe, and -4 from being blinded. Therefore he hits on 5+, or 11+ after factoring in the chieftain’s armor class of 6.

**Fighting Style:** A combatant’s **fighting style** can sometimes affect his melee attack throw. Combatants fighting in the dual weapon style gain a +1 bonus to the melee attack throw from having the second weapon. If the combatant has Fighting Style Specialization (dual weapon), he gains an additional +1 bonus, for a total of +2. If a dual-wielding combatant’s off-hand weapon is magical, its magical bonus is also added to the attack throw (stacking with another weapon the way a shield stacks with armor), but not to the damage roll. However, the dual weapon style does notgive additional attacks.

**Special Maneuvers:** Instead of making a standard melee attack, combatants can attempt to disarm, knock down, wrestle, or otherwise disrupt their opponent in some way. See **Special Maneuvers**, below.

###### Missile Attacks

| Torch | Up to 15’ | …to 30’ | …to 45’ |
| Warhammer (thrown) | Up to 15’ | …to 30’ | …to 45’ |

Missile attacks can be from bows, slings, crossbows, and even thrown items like bottles of holy water or oil flasks. In order to make a missile attack at a particular target, the target must be in **range**. The Missile Weapon Ranges table shows the short, medium, and long range of various missile weapons. Missile attack throws against targets at short range are not penalized. Missile attack throws against targets at medium range have a -2 penalty. Missile attack throws against targets at long range have a -5 penalty. If an opponent is further away than the long range listed, the missile weapon cannot target that opponent at all (unless he is part of a large formation, see below).

In most cases, the target must also be in **line of sight**. Line of sight can be blocked by corners, hills, walls, or other obstacles that completely block the view. Line of sight is not blocked by intervening combatants, nor by arrow loops, battlements, or other types of **cover**. However, cover can make it harder to hit.

Missile attacks at targets in cover suffer a -2 penalty if the cover is waist-high (like a hedge) and -4 if the cover is chest high (like a battlement) or very narrow (like an arrow loop).

Missile attacks through intervening **engaged** allies to strike at unengaged enemy targets suffer a -4 penalty. Missile attacks at enemy targets engaged with allied targets are not permitted at all due to the risk of friendly fire, unless the attacker has Precise Shooting proficiency. Attackers with Precise Shooting can shoot engaged targets at a -4 penalty, and unengaged targets through a melee at no penalty. They also ignore up to 4 points of cover. Missile attacks are never allowed against an enemy engaging the firer.

In addition to range and cover, attack throws with missile weapons might be modified by the attacker’s DEX modifier and by his and/or his target’s weapons, ammunition magic items, class powers, proficiencies, and/or conditions. A combatant who uses a magic missile weapon or magic ammunition adds the bonus to both the attack throw and damage. A combatant who fires magic ammunition from a magic weapon adds the higher bonus to his attack throw and adds both bonuses to his damage roll.

###### Missile Attacks vs. Troop Formations

When fighting on the battlefield, troops march in large formations. Man-sized infantry formations typically consist of 30 troops (platoons), 120 troops (company), 480 troops (battalion), or 1920 troops (brigade) occupying a frontage of 15’, 60’, 240’, and 960’ respectively. Because of these formations are so large, it much easier to target a formation rather than an individual troop within the formation.

* A platoon can be targeted at long range as if it were at medium range.
* A company can be targeted out to long range with no penalty.
* A battalion can be targeted out to double long range with no penalty.
* A brigade can be targeted out to quadruple long range with no penalty.

When making an attack against a formation, the actual target struck by the attack is determined randomly by the Judge. If there are allies engaged with the unit, the allies count as possible targets. The attacker cannot choose a target.

EXAMPLE: Athelstan is equipped with a long bow. A long bow has a medium range of 220’ and a long range of 360’. Athelstan can fire at a platoon 360’ away with a -2 penalty. He can fire at a company 360’ away with no penalty. He can fire at a battalion 720’ away at no penalty. He can fire at a brigade 1420’ away at no penalty. 1420’ is 475 yards. Historians typically set the absolute maximum range of the long bow at 450 to 500 yards. However, an English longbowmen could not hope to hit a man-sized target at 475 yards, and neither can Athelstan.

###### Missile Attacks with Burning Oil, Holy Water, and Torches

**Oil flasks** can be lit and then thrown as missile attacks. A missile attack with an oil flask is always targeted at an **impact point**. The impact point can be a particular creature, structure, vessel, terrain feature, or simply a point on a ceiling, floor, wall, or obstacle. The attacker must have a line of sight to the desired impact point. If the attacker’s line of sight to its impact point is blocked, then the oil flask’s impact point becomes the point at which its line of sight is blocked. Once the impact point is designated, the combatant hurling the oil flask makes an attack throw. If the impact point is in or behind cover, or at a different elevation from the attacker, apply those modifiers to throw. If the impact point is a creature, structure, or vessel, apply its AC. The result is determined by the attack throw:

* A direct hit occurs if the attacker’s modified attack throw is sufficient to hit the impact point. If the impact point is on a wooden structure or vessel, the oil deals 1 structural fire damage. If the impact point is a creature, then the oil deals 1d8 fire damage to the creature immediately, and another 1d8 fire damage on the same initiative count next round. A direct hit on the impact point also can deal splash damage to all targets within 5’ of it (see below).
* A splash occurs if the attacker’s modified attack throw is sufficient to hit the impact point, ignoring the target’s Armor Class. The combatant at the impact point (if any), and each combatant within 5’ of the impact point, must make a Blast saving throw. If the save fails, the combatant suffers 1d3 fire damage, and on a success avoid being splashed.
* A fumble occurs if the attacker’s attack throw is an unmodified 1. A fumble with oil results in the attacker setting himself on fire. He suffers damage as if directly hit. A fumble does not cause splash damage.
* A miss occurs on any other result. Roll 1d12 to determine the scatter (misdirection) of the throw, applied as a clock direction from the target. If thrown at short range, the oil flask lands 1d10’ away in the indicated direction. If thrown at medium range, it lands 2d10’ away. If thrown at long range, it lands 5d10’ away. Combatants within 5’ of the oil flask when it lands must make successful Blast saving throws or suffer splash damage, as above.

Unlike ordinary missile attacks, missile attacks with burning oil can target **engaged** opponents, albeit at grave risk of splash damage and scatter. The attack throw suffers a -4 penalty, or no penalty if the attacker has Precise Shooting proficiency.

Characters can also throw oil flasks unlit to avoid the risk of setting themselves on fire. Unlit oil does no damage, but can be lit with a torch later (either through melee or missile attacks). A character splashed with unlit oil takes 1d3 fire damage when it is lit. A character directly hit by unlit oil takes 1d8 fire damage when it is lit and another 1d8 fire damage on the same initiative count the following round.

An oil flask can also be poured on the ground and lit. Oil that is poured on the ground can cover a diameter of 5’ and burns for a full turn. It inflicts 1d8 fire damage to any creature that starts its initiative in or enters the burning patch.

**Vials of holy water** can also be thrown like flasks of burning oil. Holy water deals extraordinary luminous damage to chaotic enchanted creatures following the same rules as burning oil, but is harmless to other creatures. (Unholy water deals extraordinary necrotic damage to lawful enchanted creatures.) Holy water must be kept in its designated containers or it loses its sacred properties.

While not area of effect weapons, **torches** can also be thrown at creatures, structures, vessels, terrain features, or points. On a direct hit, a thrown torch deals 1d4 fire damage to its target. On a splash, it deals 1 fire damage to its target, then falls to the ground. On a miss, it scatters and does not deal damage. The torch remains lit. However, on a fumble, it scatters and is extinguished. Throwing torches is not a very effective combat tactic, but can be very useful for adventurers who want to illuminate an area up ahead without advancing into it.

Missile attacks with burning oil, holy water, or torches do not gain a bonus to damage from high STR or from class.

###### Missile Attacks with Artillery

A missile attack with artillery is always targeted at an **impact point**. The impact point can be a particular creature, structure, vessel, terrain feature, or simply a point in space. The artillery must have a line of sight to the desired impact point. If the artillery’s line of sight to its impact point is blocked, then the artillery’s impact point becomes the point at which its line of sight is blocked

Once the impact point is designated, the artillery crew makes an attack throw. If the impact point is a creature, structure, or vessel, apply its AC. The result is determined by the attack throw:

* A direct hit occurs if the attacker’s modified attack throw is sufficient to hit the target. If the impact point is on a structure or vessel, the artillery deals damage to the structural hit points (shp) of the target. If the impact point is a creature, terrain feature, or point in space, then the artillery deals damage to the creature and any other creatures in its area of effect. Creatures in the area of effect (excluding the creature at the impact point, if any) can reduce damage by half with a successful Blast saving throw.
* A splash occurs if the attacker’s modified attack throw is sufficient to hit the target, ignoring the target’s Armor Class. The artillery deals damage to any creatures in its area of effect. Creatures in the area of effect (including a creature at the impact point) can avoid all damage with a successful Blast saving throw. Splashes do not usually deal damage to structures.
* A fumble occurs if the character’s attack throw is an unmodified 1. A fumble with combustible pitch results in the artillery being set on fire, as if directly hit. A fumble with a repeating ballista indicates a malfunction requiring 1 turn for a siege engineer to repair. During this time the ballista cannot be fired. A fumble with any other weapon and ammunition results in a scatter of 6d6 feet per 250’ of range (see below).
* A scatter occurs on any other result. Roll 1d12 to determine the direction to a new impact point, applied as a clock direction from the original impact point (such that 6’o’clock points towards the firing artillery). The new impact point is 3d6 feet away per 250’ of range. Resolve the effects of the artillery as if a splash had occurred at the new impact point

The following other rules apply.

**Accuracy:** Counterweight trebuchets gain a +2 bonus on attack throws. Catapults and trebuchets (but not ballistas) have difficulty striking small, fast-moving creatures. They suffer a -4 penalty to attack throws against man-sized creatures and a -2 penalty to attack throws against large (ogre-sized) creatures. They suffer an additional -1 penalty to attack throws per 10’ of movement the creature moved. The size penalty does not apply to formations of troops, but the movement penalty does.

**Crew:** The number of crew and type of artillery determines rate of fire. Making a missile attack with artillery is a full-round action for the entire crew. The crew act on the same initiative, rolled with the worst initiative modifier of any crew member. Artillery crews attack as the lowest level member of the crew. Artillery crews without an artillerist reduce their rate of fire by half and suffer -4 to attack throws. In between shots, the artillery is reloaded, the firing arm is cranked back into position, the frame is adjusted to aim at a new target, etc.

**Range:** Artillery cannot be used to attack targets closer than the minimum range or farther than the maximum range indicated. Artillery do not have any range penalties within their effective range. However, artillery firing crude ammunition suffer a -2 to attack throws at all ranges.

**Damaging Stone Structures:** Light and medium ballista cannot damage stone structures, even with a direct hit. All other artillery deal 1/10 damage to stone structures on a direct hit.

**Damaging Wood Structures:** On a direct hit, light and medium ballista deal 1/10 damage to wooden structures; heavy ballista and light catapults deal 1/3 damage to wooden structure; and other artillery deal full damage to wooden structures.

**Damaging Wood Structures with Burning Pitch:** Some artillery can fire burning pitch. A wooden structure that is directly hit or splashed by burning pitch immediately takes structural fire damage and is set aflame. A character in the pitch’s area of effect must make a Blast saving throw. If the save fails, the character takes 4d6 fire damage. If the save succeeds, the character suffers half that damage.

Each round thereafter, on the same initiative count, the pitch continues to deal 4d6 structural fire damage to the wooden structure and 4d6 fire damage to characters in the area of effect (half that on a successful save). A character in or within 5’ of the area of effect can fight the fire as a full-round action. When a total of 15 full-round actions have been spent fighting the fire (e.g. 5 characters spending 3 full-round actions each), the fire is extinguished.

### Dealing Damage

When combatants successfully attack, they deal damage. Damage dealt is based on the type of weapon as well as the fighting style with which the combatant is wielding it:

* Whips deal 1d2 damage.
* Unarmed strikes deal 1d3 nonlethal damage.
* Tiny melee weapons, such as daggers, hatchets, clubs, and bludgeons all deal 1d4 damage. A staff deals 1d4 damage when wielded one-handed, and 1d6 damage when wielded two-handed.
* Small melee weapons designed exclusively for one-handed use, such as hand axes, javelins, and short swords, deal 1d6 points of damage.
* Medium melee weapons designed for both one- or two-handed use, such as flails, battle axes, maces, morning stars, picks, spears, swords, and warhammers, deal 1d6 damage when wielded one-handed, or 1d8 damage when wielded two-handed.
* Large melee weapons designed exclusively for two-handed use, such as polearms and two-handed swords, deal 1d10 damage.
* Thrown daggers, darts, and sling stones deal 1d4 damage. Arrows, crossbow bolts, and staff-slung stones bolts deal 1d6 damage. Arbalest bolts deal 1d8 damage.
* Combatants dual wielding two weapons do 1d6 damage if the weapon in their main hand is medium or small, and 1d4 damage if the weapon is tiny. The size of the weapon in their off-hand does not affect damage.
* Natural weapons used by monsters deal the damage listed in the monster’s entry.

The damage from an attack can be modified by the attacker’s Strength and by the attacker and/or the target’s magic bonuses, class powers, proficiencies, or conditions. Damage modifiers cannot reduce damage from a successful attack to 0 except by magic — at least 1 hp of damage will be dealt otherwise.

Some weapons deal **impact damage** when used in a charge, countercharge, or readied attack against a charging opponent. Impact damage is usually one extra die of damage by the weapon, though some monsters deal even more impact damage than that. Any impact damage dealt is of the same damage type as the weapon used.

###### Damage Type

Every spell, effect, or weapon that deals damage has one or more **damage types**. Damage types are important because some combatants are resistant or immune to them. There are 12 damage types in ***ACKS II****,* split into **physical** and **energy** damage. The physical damage types are acidic, arcane, bludgeoning, piercing, poisonous, and slashing. The energy damage types are cold, electric, fire, luminous, necrotic, seismic. If not otherwise tagged, damage is considered **mundane**, but some damage is tagged **extraordinary**.

* Acidic: Damage dealt by caustic and corrosive agents. Acidic damage can be dealt by natural acids and certain spells.
* Arcane: Damage dealt by magical physical force. Arcane damage can only be dealt by magic.
* Bludgeoning: Damage dealt by blunt force. Bludgeoning damage can be dealt by clubs, maces, and so on, or by spells.
* Cold: Damage dealt by exposure to extreme cold. Cold damage can be dealt by natural cold or by water elemental magic.
* Electric: Damage dealt by electricity. Electric damage can be dealt by natural lightning or by air elemental magic.
* Fire: Damage dealt by flame and heat. Fire damage can be dealt by natural heat and flame or by fire elemental magic.
* Luminous: Damage dealt by generative forces of creation and light. Luminous damage is only dealt by magic, usually divine.
* Necrotic: Damage dealt by entropic forces of destruction and darkness. Necrotic damage is usually dealt by death magic.
* Piercing: Damage dealt by penetration. Piercing damage is dealt by arrows, spears, and similar weapons and by some spells.
* Poisonous: Damage dealt by toxins. Poisonous damage can be dealt by natural venoms and by some spells.
* Seismic: Damage dealt by tectonic forces. Seismic damage can be dealt by natural earthquakes or by earth elemental magic.
* Slashing: Damage dealt by laceration. Slashing damage can be dealt by axes, swords, and similar weapons and by some spells.

If an attack can deal two or more types of damage, the target must be resistant or invulnerable to both or all of the types dealt to reduce or avoid the damage.

###### Damage Type Immunity and Resistance

Some combatants are immune or resistant to particular damage types. When a combatant is **immune** to a damage type, it automatically succeeds on all saving throws against spells or special abilities that deal that damage type, and ignores damage of that type. A combatant might be immune to both mundane and extraordinary damage of a type, or to just one or the other. When a combatant is **resistant** to a damage type, it suffers only half damage from that type. It also gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against spells or special abilities that deal that damage type.

Some monsters have particular flaws in their immunity or resistance. One common flaw is that the monster treats weapons made of silver as if they were magic for purposes of its resistance.

Since most monsters use natural attacks like bites and claws, this raises the question of whether monsters deal mundane or extraordinary damage. The ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual***specifies the exact damage type for each monster attack. In general, the following rules apply:

* If a monster is a humanoid, its natural attacks always deal mundane damage.
* If a monster is an animal with more than 4+1 HD and of huge size or larger, its natural attacks deal extraordinary damage; otherwise they deal mundane damage.
* If a monster is a construct, giant, monstrosity, undead, or vermin with more than 4+1 HD, its natural attacks deal extraordinary damage; otherwise they deal mundane damage.
* If a monster is an incarnation, its natural attacks always deal extraordinary damage.

###### Effects of Damage

All damage dealt is subtracted from a combatant’s hit points. When a combatant’s hit points drop to 0 or fewer, the combatant is usually **unconscious** and possiblydead. (A few types of combatants are immediately destroyed or slain, explained below.) The combatant’s condition remains uncertain until an ally either casts a *cure* spell on it or otherwise treats its wounds, or until necromantic magic is used on it. When this occurs, the unconscious combatant must roll 1d20 and 1d6 on the **Mortal Wounds** table for the type of damage that felled it. (For piercing or slashing damage dealt by natural weapons, use the **Permanent Wounds – Savage** table.) Combatants not treated within 24 hours of being unconscious mustroll, with no bonus for treatment and at the full -10 penalty for being treated 1 day later.

Apply the modifiers listed below to the d20 roll. The modified 1d20 roll determines the unconscious combatant’s condition while the unmodified 1d6 roll determines the **permanent wound** the creature suffers, if any.

* *Combatant’s Constitution:* ± CON modifier of unconscious combatant
* *Combatant’s Equipment:* +2 if wearing heavy helm
* *Combatant’s Hit Die Value:* +2 if d6 HD; +4 if d8 HD; +6 if d10 HD; +8 if d12 HD
* *Combatant’s Hit Points:* +5 if hp are exactly 0; -2 if hp are at negative value from ¼ to ½ max hp; -5 if hp are at negative value from -½ to max hp; -10 if hp are at negative value from max to 2x max hp; -20 if hp are at negative value greater than 2x max hp
* *Ally’s Healing Magic:* +1 per level of healing magic applied to unconscious creature; +1/2 class level if laying on hands
* *Ally’s Healing Proficiency:* +1 per rank of Healing proficiency
* *Ally’s Healing Herbs:* +2 if Horsetail applied
* *Necromantic Magic:* -1/2 spell level if roll triggered by necromantic magic
* *Treatment Timing:* +2 if treated within 1 round of injury; -3 if treated within 1 turn of injury; -5 if treated within 1 hour of injury; -8 if treated within 1 day of injury; -10 if treated more than 1 day after injury

Magic used to gain a bonus to the Mortal Wounds roll does not heal damage. If the Mortal Wounds roll was at least a 16, the combatant will awaken with 1 hp. If the Mortal Wounds roll was 15 or less, the combatant remains at its current hp (i.e. 0 or fewer) and begins dying. If the combatant is not then subsequently healed by the end of the listed time period for its condition, it is slain.

Constructs, incarnations, and undead that are reduced to 0 hp are immediately destroyed. Plants and oozes reduced to 0 hp are immediately slain. They cannot have their wounds treated nor benefit from healing magic.

EXAMPLE: Marcus, a fighter with 36 hit points and 18 CON, is reduced to -12 hit points by a *fireball*. His ally Balbus casts *cure serious injury* on him the next round. Marcus now rolls on the Mortal Wounds - Fire table. His d20 roll is modified by -2 (because his hp are at a negative value greater than ¼ his maximum hit points) +4 (from his d8 HD) +4 (from *cure serious injury*) +2 (treated within one round of injury) and +3 (modifier for 18 CON) for a total adjustment of +11. Unfortunately he rolls a 6, modified to 17, indicating that he is in shock. He is at 1 hp and needs magical healing and a night’s bed rest to recover. His d6 roll is a 2, so his ear is burned off. He suffers a permanent -1 penalty to surprise rolls and Listening throws. Note that Marcus did not regain any hp from *cure serious injury*.

What if Balbus had kept his *cure serious injury* to use after the roll? In that case, Marcus would have only had a +7 modifier, so his roll would have only been a 13. In this case, he would have been critically wounded with -12 hp. Marcus’s allies would have had just one day to get him to 1 hp before he died. In addition, his permanent wound would have been much worse — instead of a lost ear, he’d have had his manhood burned off! (A sadly common plight for adventurers, we are told.) It’s almost always better to use the healing spell on a Mortal Wounds roll when available.

If a combatant suffers a permanent wound, the effects are permanent until the wound is healed. *Repair disfigurement & disability*, *restore life and limb*, *trollblood*, and similar magic can heal one or more permanent wounds. If a combatant is killed, he can be revived with *restore life and limb* or other magical effect that restores the dead to life.

However, combatants treated with such magic often need extensive periods of time to recover, and might suffer strange side effects. The character rolls 1d20 and 1d6 on the **Tampering with Mortality** table for his alignment and applies the modifiers listed below. The resulting side effects are permanent and can only be removed with a *miracle* or *wish*.

* *Span of Combatant’s Life:* +2 if creature is youthful; 0 if creature is adult; -5 if creature is middle aged; -10 if creature is old; -20 if creature is ancient
* *Spellcaster’s Power:* +½ level of spellcaster casting spell; +2 if cast in temple of spellcaster’s god
* *State of the Combatant’s Body:* -10 if creature instantly killed; -5 per spine severing; -2 per limb destroyed; -1 per each hand/foot/ear/eye/tongue/genitalia destroyed
* *State of the Combatant’s Soul:* ±WIL modifier of creature; -1 for each full day creature has been dead; -1 for each side effect already suffered

When applying penalties due to the state of the combatant’s body, a combatant is considered to be instantly killed if it died from disease or poison, was slain while helpless, or rolled an “instantly killed” result on the Mortal Wounds table. The maximum penalty for state of the combatant’s body is -10.

The Mortal Wounds and Tampering with Mortality tables can be found in **Appendix C: Wounds and Woe** (p. XX). The permanent wounds and side effects are described in the tables.

###### Healing

Virtually all creatures recover hit points through rest. For each full day dedicated to rest in reasonably sanitary conditions, a combatant will recover 1d3 hp. Characters with the Healing proficiency can improve a creature’s natural healing (p. XX).

Interruptions during rest of more than 1 turn in duration prevents a creature from recovering any health that day. However, the healing process can be hastened through the use of magic, such as potions or spells, which can provide instantaneous or expedited recovery. It is possible to combine magical healing with natural healing to enhance the healing process.

Some results on the Mortal Wounds or Tampering with Mortality tables will indicate that a creature needs a period of bed rest to recover. During this time, the creature is **incapacitated**. It cannot be healed above 1 hit point by natural or magical healing, and cannot attack, cast spells, or undertake dedicated activities of any sort. If an incapacitated creature is reduced to 0 hp again before it has had sufficient rest, it is instantly slain. If the table indicates that the period of bed rest can be shortened with magical healing, then any form of healing magic, including **cure**spells, potions, Laying On Hands, or other means, will suffice. Otherwise, the period of bed rest cannot be shortened. An incapacitated creature under the care of a character with Healing proficiency can take bed rest when traveling as a passenger in a vehicle.

###### Nonlethal Damage

Some attacks may inflict **nonlethal damage**. Nonlethal damage is subtracted from a creature’s hit points like normal damage. A creature reduced to 0 hp or less by nonlethal damage, or any combination of normal or nonlethal damage, is still unconsciousand possiblydead. However, the likelihood of death and the rate of healing are different for nonlethal damage, so a running total of the amount of nonlethal damage should still be recorded.

EXAMPLE: Marcus is fighting an ogre with 26 hit points. In the first round of combat, Marcus stabs the ogre for 8 piercing damage, reducing it to 18 current hit points. In the second round of combat, Marcus starts attacking with the flat of his blade (a **special maneuver**, described later,that incurs a -4 penalty to his attack throw) to attempt to knock out the ogre. He inflicts 6 nonlethal bludgeoning damage in the second round and 9 points of nonlethal damage in the third round. At this point the ogre has 3 current hit points and has taken 15 nonlethal damage. In the fourth round, Marcus makes a normal attack that deals 7 slashing damage. This reduces the ogre to -4 hit points. Because it has now taken a combination of normal and nonlethal damage reducing its hit points to 0 or fewer, the ogre is knocked out and possibly dead.

Creatures reduced to 0 hp or less by nonlethal damage are far less likely to have sustained mortal wounds. When the creature rolls on the **Mortal Wounds** table, modify the die roll by +1 per point of nonlethal damage dealt before the creature was knocked unconscious. (Pummeling your allies after they are incapacitated does not help them recover).

EXAMPLE: Immediately after the fight, Marcus rouses the ogre to interrogate it. The Judge rolls 1d20+1d6 for the ogre and gets a 9 and a 3. Marcus did not use any healing magic or have Healing proficiency, so the 1d20 roll is modified by +15 (because ogre took 15 nonlethal damage) and -2 (because it was treated after the fight), for a +13 modifier, yielding a total of 22. Cross-referencing 22 and 3 on the Mortal Wounds table, the Judge determines that the ogre awakens concussed, with 1 hp, having lost 1d6 teeth. It will require 1 day of bed rest or magical healing.

Once a creature has resolved its condition on the Mortal Wounds table, all nonlethal damage is removed. Otherwise, nonlethal damage recovers at a rate of 1 hit point per hour. Spells or magical powers that cure hit point damage remove an equal amount of nonlethal damage in addition to their normal healing.

### Cleaving

In the legends and sagas, heroes can chop through weak foes quickly, often slaying two with one blow. Skilled archers might fire as quickly as one arrow every few seconds, fire two arrows at once, or pierce multiple foes with one arrow. The Cleaving rules simulate these feats of glorious mayhem.

Whenever a combatant kills or incapacitates an opponent with a melee or missile attack, he can immediately make another attack throw against another opponent in melee or missile range. The additional attack throw must be with the same weapon as the attack that killed the previous opponent. A combatant with multiple attacks must attack again with whichever attack incapacitated or killed the target. A combatant with multiple attacks must complete all cleaves triggered by its present attack before making the next attack in its routine.

A combatant who cleaves after an ambush or backstab continues to receive a +4 bonus on his attack throw and to deal extra damage provided that each subsequent target was eligible to be ambushed or backstabbed by the combatant at the start of his attack routine. As soon as the combatant attacks a target who doesn’t qualify, the ambush or backstab bonus is lost, though the combatant can keep cleaving if eligible.

Monsters, fighters, and other characters that use the fighter attack throw progression can make a maximum number of cleave attacks per round equal to their Hit Dice. Clerics, thieves, and other characters that use the cleric/thief attack throw progression can make a maximum number of cleave attacks per round equal to half their Hit Dice (rounded down). Mages and characters that use the mage attack throw progression cannot make cleave attacks.

###### Cleaving in Melee

When cleaving after a melee attack, a combatant who incapacitates or kills a target can take a 5’ step toward another target in line of sight prior to making the cleave attack. The combatant can take a 5’ step even if **engaged** by another target or targets, but must remain engaged by them at the end of its 5’ step unless it is moving after a successful overrun against them.

A combatant who cleaves after a charge or countercharge continues to receive a +2 bonus on its attack throw and to deal impact damage (if its weapon deals impact damage on a charge or countercharge) provided it takes a 5’ step after each cleave. As soon as the combatant cleaves without moving, the charge bonus is lost, though the combatant can keep cleaving if eligible

A combatant who cleaves after a readied attack with an impact weapon on a charging target continues to deal impact damage provided that each subsequent targets also charged. As soon as the combatant attacks a target who doesn’t qualify, the extra damage is lost, though the combatant can keep cleaving if eligible.

If, after completing a melee attack that killed or incapacitated a target, the combatant has no targets remaining within 5’ that he can engage, and has cleaves remaining, he can expend a cleave to hurl a thrown weapon. If he hurls a weapon and incapacitates or kills the target, he can cleave with other thrown weapons if available. Alternatively, he can expend a cleave to revert to the Defend action or to Ready a Combat Action. If he had Charged, reverting to Defend simply removes the -2 penalty from Charging, so that this penalty need not be tracked. (In the game world, the character, having destroyed all foes nearby, assumes a protective stance. This is seen in historical source material such as ***Conan the Barbarian***, where Valeria assumes a defensive stance after slaying all of Doom’s minions during the escape from the Mountain of Doom, as well as in most Akira Kurosawa samurai movies.)

A large magic melee weapon that deals bludgeoning or slashing damage adds its magic bonus to the maximum number of cleaves you can take with it, including for purposes of sweep attacks.

###### Cleaving with Missile Weapons

When cleaving after a missile attack, the attacker can move 5’ after each attack away from visible enemies. When making cleave attacks with missile weapons, combatants are limited to a maximum of 2 with arbalest or crossbow, and 3 + STR bonus with long bow and composite bow. They can take any number of cleaves using short bows, slings, sling-staffs, or thrown bola, darts, daggers, hand axes, javelins, spears, or warhammers, subject to their class, level, and available ammunition. Each target must be in the same range category as the original target, but the targets do not need to be within 5’ of each other.

If, after completing a missile attack that killed or incapacitated a target, the combatant has no targets in range that are unengaged by allies, and has cleaves remaining, he can expend a cleave to Ready, or to drop prone, hide, or move 5’ into cover. (In the game world, the character, having killed all threatening targets, seizes the opportunity to duck back into cover. This is seen in all historical source material. Missile firers who fail to kill all targets are assumed to still be in the process of engaging targets, caught off guard by the number of foes, or otherwise delay for that split second that lets them get blasted.)

### Saving Throws

Combatants are sometimes allowed or required to make **saving throws** to avoid the full effects of spells or certain attacks. There are five categories of saving throws. The appropriate saving throw to use and the effects of a success or failure will be indicated in the description of the spell, monster attack, or dungeon scenario. When there is a doubt as to which category to use, start at the left column and move to the right, and use the first which matches the particular effect.

* **Paralysis** covers those effects in which the victim will be rendered immobile or put in flight, such as being paralyzed by a ghoul, turned to stone, put to sleep, or subjected to a **fear** or **halt** spell.
* **Death** includes those effects where hit points are rendered irrelevant and the result is instant death, dismemberment, disease, disintegration, blindness, or other deadly effect.
* **Blast** is used for damaging effects targeting an area, such as a ball of fire, a lightning bolt, a dragon’s breath weapon, a collapsing ceiling, an avalanche, and so on, excluding effects covered by one of the earlier categories.
* **Implements** is used for any magical effects from items such as rings, rods, staffs, and wands not covered by one of the earlier categories.
* **Spells** covers any magical effect from a cast spell not covered by one of the earlier categories.

Characters and monsters have a target value for each saving throw category determined by their class, race, and level and/or HD. Like all throws, saving throws are made by rolling 1d20, applying any relevant modifiers (such as the character’s WIL modifier), and comparing the modified die roll to the throw’s target value.

A result that is greater than or equal to the target value is a success. A result that is less than the target value is a failure. As with all throws, an unmodified roll of 20 is always a success, and an unmodified roll of 1 is always a failure.

A successful saving throw rolls can sometimes completely negate an effect, but other times it will merely reduce the severity of the effect. An attack like a venomous bite can cause harm in two ways: through the physical bite and through the poison that may be injected into the wound. The damage is applied as hit points, while the result of the poison is resolved with a saving throw.

###### Saving Throw Adjustments from Cover

Combatants in cover gain bonus to Blast saving throws caused by artillery, burning oil, or similar effects. if the cover is waist-high (like a hedge), the bonus is +2. If the cover is chest-high (like a battlement) or very narrow (like an arrow loop), the bonus is +4. In addition, on a successful saving throw, creatures protected by arrow slits take nodamage, even if the effect would normally deal ½ damage.

###### Size-Adjusted Saving Throws

Sometimes a saving throw will be designed as **size-adjusted**, e.g. “the combatant must make a size-adjusted Paralysis saving throw.” A combatant making a size-adjusted saving throw suffers a -2 penalty to its saving throw per size category smaller than the creature which triggered the saving throw, but gains a +2 bonus to its saving throw per size category larger than the creature which triggered the throw.

EXAMPLE: A stone giant has made a successful throw to force back a human fighter. The fighter is required to make a size-adjusted Paralysis saving throw. The stone giant is huge, while the human is man-sized – two size categories smaller. Therefore the fighter saves at -4. If the fighter were forcing back the giant, the giant would save at +4.

###### Saving Throw Tables

For convenience, we have re-printed the saving throw tables for each class. Note that the fighter progression has been broadened to include 0th level NPCs as well as high HD monsters.

### Casting Spells and Using Magic

In order to cast a spell, a spellcaster must inform the Judge that a spell is being cast, and which spell will be cast, before the initiative dice are rolled. If the caster takes damage or fails a saving throw before he acts, the spell is interrupted and lost. (The spell still counts against the character’s spells per day as if it had been cast.) A caster cannot move or perform any other action on the round he attempts to cast a spell.

A spellcaster must have a line of sight on the targets or area the spell is cast on. Some spells also require that the caster be **beholding** the target or that the target be **beholding** the caster or the effect. A creature is beholding an ally, enemy, or effect when that ally, enemy, or effect is in line of sight and within 10% of maximum visibility distance (typically 60’ for man-sized creatures).

Some spells impose other, unique conditions. Unlike melee and missile attacks, most spell attacks will automatically hit their chosen targets if they are within the spells’ range and area of effect. Certain spells permit or mandate a saving throw for the target(s) by which they can reduce or even nullify the spell’s effects. See the discussion on **Spells** in Chapter 5 and **saving throws** later in this chapter.

Some spells require that a caster maintain **concentration**. More powerful spells can require the caster maintain stationary concentration. See Conditions (p. XX) for rules on concentration and stationary concentration.

Some combatants can use magic without casting spells, either via spell-like abilities or via magic items. Spell-like abilities function like spell except that they only require a combat action to use and cannot be interrupted. Most magic items grant the user spell-like abilities, but scrolls are cast as spells.

### Special Maneuvers

Not every action in combat will be a sword swing, arrow shot, or fireball. The rules below explain how to handle everything from a punch with a plate mail gauntlet to a giant tossing a dwarf. Combatants cannot cleave after special maneuvers unless the maneuver itself incapacitates the target or states that it permits cleaves. Except where otherwise noted, combatants with multiple attacks (such as claw/claw/bite or multiple tentacles) can use any or all attacks from their attack routine to perform special maneuvers.

EXAMPLE: A giant octopus with eight tentacles might force back an opponent with one tentacle, wrestle an opponent with another tentacle, and attack normally with the remaining 6 tentacles.

###### Brawling

Sometimes a combatant will attack without a weapon, striking with a fist or foot. This is called brawling. Normal characters do 1d3 points of nonlethal damage with a punch, or 1d4 with a kick; kicks are rolled at a -2 penalty on the attack throw. Standard Strength adjustments apply. (See the **Nonlethal Damage** section, above, for details on nonlethal damage.) All character classes can engage in brawling; there is no “weapon” restriction in this case.

However, a character in light, very light, or no armor cannot successfully punch or kick a character in medium or heavy armor – if this is attempted, the damage is applied to the attacker instead of the defender. The Judge must decide which monsters can be successfully brawled based on their AC and physical make-up. Monsters do not themselves brawl, as they have natural attacks that are as good as weapons.

###### Clamber

A combatant can attempt to clamber on top of a creature that is one or more size categories larger than him. To clamber onto a creature, a combatant must succeed on a melee attack throw with a -4 penalty. If the combatant is proficient in Climbing, the -4 penalty is waived if the character makes a successful proficiency throw.

If the combatant’s attempt succeeds, the creature must then make a size-adjusted Paralysis saving throw. However the size adjustment is reversed, so the creature suffers a -2 penalty to its saving throw per size category *larger* than the combatant. If the creature succeeds on its saving throw, it has shrugged off the combatant’s attempt. If it fails, the combatant is now **clambering** on the creature. The combatant might be mounted on its back, perched on its shoulders, etc.

A **clambering** combatant gains a +2 attack bonus against the creature he has clambered onto. In addition, the creature that has been clambered onto is **vulnerable** to the clambering combatant. A clambering combatant also gains a measure of protection against the creature’s own attacks. If the creature lacks arms, tails, or other appendages capable of reaching its own back, it cannot directly attack the clambering combatant. Even if the creature does have such appendages, it attacks the clambering combatant with a -4 penalty to attack throws.

As an action in lieu of attacking, a creature with one or more combatants clambering on it can attempt to unseat the clambering combatants by bucking, rearing, colliding with walls, and similar tactics. This forces every combatant clambering on the creature to make a Paralysis saving throw. Combatants who succeed on the saving throw continue clambering. Combatants who fail the saving throw slip off the creature. If the creature is more than 10’ tall at the shoulder, or is flying, the unseated combatants will suffer 1d6 bludgeoning damage per 10’ fallen.

###### Coup de Grace

A combatant can coup de grace a helpless opponent of the same or smaller size category. Provided the combatant is not **engaged**, and his attack is capable of damaging the helpless creature, then the helpless creature can be automatically slain without needing to roll to hit or damage it. The combatant cannot cleave after coup de gracing a helpless creature. Unlike an ordinary attack, a coup de grace does not end the sneaking condition.

###### Disarm

A combatant can attempt to disarm his opponent of a weapon in his hand. To disarm an opponent, the combatant must make a melee attack throw with a -4 penalty. If the attack succeeds, the opponent suffers damage and then must make a Paralysis saving throw. The opponent gains a +4 bonus if he is wielding his weapon two-handed. If the opponent’s save succeeds, he maintains his grip on the weapon or item. If the opponent’s save fails, the weapon or item is knocked 5’ away.

###### Force Back

A combatant can attempt to force an opponent back, pushing him into an obstacle, through a doorway, or off a cliff. To force back an opponent, the combatant must make a melee attack throw with a -4 penalty. If the attack succeeds, the opponent suffers damage and then must make a size-adjusted Paralysis saving throw. If the opponent’s save succeeds, he stands his ground. If the opponent’s save fails, he is forced back a number of feet equal to the damage dealt by the combatant. If this would push the opponent into a wall or obstacle, the opponent is knocked down, taking 1d6 bludgeoning damage per 10’ he has traveled.

If the opponent is pushed into another character or monster, he is knocked **prone** if the character or monster he is pushed into is as large or larger than him. If the character or monster he is pushed into is smaller, the smaller character/monster is instead knocked **prone**, and the opponent continues to be forced back.

###### Incapacitate

Combatants can attempt to knock out rather than kill their opponents, e.g. attacking with the “flat of the blade”, pulling their blows, and so on. To make an incapacitating attack with a weapon, the combatant must make a melee attack throw with a -4 penalty. If the attack succeeds, it deals nonlethal damage. Brawling attacks (see above) are always nonlethal damage.

###### Knock Down

A combatant can attempt to trip, sweep, or otherwise knock his opponent down by special maneuver. To knock down an opponent, the combatant must make a melee attack throw with a -4 penalty. If the attack succeeds, the opponent suffers damage and then must make a size-adjusted Paralysis saving throw. If the opponent’s save succeeds, he stays on his feet. If the opponent’s save fails, he is knocked **prone**.

###### Overrun

A combatant can attempt to overrun an opponent’s position without stopping to fight him. To overrun an opponent, the combatant must make a melee attack throw with a -4 penalty. If the attack succeeds, the opponent must then make a Paralysis saving throw. If the save succeeds, the opponent can choose to block the combatant, allowing the combatant to deal damage as if he had struck him with an ordinary attack. If the opponent fails on his saving throw, or chooses not to block the combatant, the combatant gains a bonus movement action and bonus combat action. The bonus movement action can only be used to move straight ahead through the opponent he has overrun by up to the combatant’s combat speed, less any movement he has already taken that initiative segment. The bonus combat action can only be used to make an attack, including another overrun.

A combatant that is **engaged** by several opponents that wishes to overrun them must sequentially overrun each opponent until has either overrun all engaging opponents or qualifies for passage of lines (p. XX).

###### Sunder

A combatant can attempt to break his opponent’s weapon or shield with a forceful blow. To sunder a weapon or shield, a combatant must make on a melee attack throw. There is a -4 penalty on the attack throw to sunder staffs, spears, and polearms, and a -6 penalty on the attack throw to sunder any other weapons or shields. If the attack succeeds, the opponent suffers damage and then must make a Paralysis saving throw. Subtract any magic bonus from the sundering weapon from the save, and add any magic bonus from the targeted weapon or shield. Daggers, swords, and shields gain a +4 bonus on the save, while staffs, spears, and polearms suffer a -4 penalty. If the saving throw is successful, the opponent’s weapon or shield is unharmed. If the saving throw is unsuccessful, the opponent’s weapon or shield is broken. Regardless of the attack and saving throw result, magic weapons and shields can only be sundered by weapons with a magic bonus equal to or greater than their own.

###### Sweep Attack

A combatant can make a sweep attack that strikes multiple targets at once. To make a sweep attack, the combatant first designates two or more targets **engaged** by him, and then makes an attack throw against each target. Each target that he successfully attacks then suffers damage equal to the ordinary damage of his attack divided by the total number of targets (including those he missed), rounded down. A sweep attack does not trigger special effects that would otherwise occur, including the additional damage from impact weapons. For instance, a giant roc making a sweep attack with its talons cannot **grab** targets. If the combatant successfully incapacitates more than half of the targets, he can cleave after the sweep attack. The cleave can be an ordinary attack or a sweep attack, as desired. A sweep attack only counts as one attack towards the combatant’s cleave limits, regardless of the number of targets.

EXAMPLE: A lesser titan equipped with a mace (6d6 damage) is engaged with four orcs. The titan makes a sweep attack on all four. He attacks each separately, hitting three but missing one. Each of the three he hit suffers damage equal to one-fourth his ordinary damage, since he attacked four targets. He rolls 6d6 and the result is 20. Each of the three orcs suffers (20/4) damage, rounded down, or 5 damage. This is enough to incapacitate the orcs. Since he killed more than half of his four targets, the titan can cleave. He uses his cleave to smash the remaining orc, hitting it for 6d6 damage.

###### Wrestling

A combatant can attempt to wrestle with an opponent. To wrestle an opponent, a combatant must make a melee attack throw with a -4 penalty. He can ignore the target’s AC from armor when making this attack, but not AC from DEX, magic bonus, natural armor, or spells. If the attack succeeds, the opponent must then make a size-adjusted Paralysis saving throw. If the opponent’s save succeeds, he has shrugged off the combatant. If the opponent’s save fails, he has been **wrestled**.

### Conditions

Conditions alter a creature’s capabilities in a variety of ways and can arise as a result of a spell, a class power, a proficiency, a monster’s attack, or other effect. Most conditions, such as **blinded**, are impairments, but a few, such as **invisible**, can be advantageous. A condition lasts either until it is countered (the prone condition is countered by standing up, for example) or for a duration specified by the effect that imposed the condition. If multiple effects impose the same condition on a creature, each instance of the condition has its own duration, but the condition’s effects don’t get worse. A creature either has a condition or doesn’t. For details on the effects of specific conditions, see Appendix B, **Conditions**.

###### General Rules for Conditions

The following rules apply to all conditions, except where otherwise noted:

* A condition that prevents a creature from casting spells also prevents the creature from using scrolls but not spell-like abilities.
* A condition that prevents a creature from moving also prevents the creature from taking actions in lieu of moving, such as standing up from being knocked down, sheathing one weapon and drawing another, readying or losing a shield, picking an item off the ground, or retrieving an item from a pack or sack.
* A condition that prevents a creature from attacking also prevents the creature from taking actions in lieu of attacking that could not be taken as actions in lieu of moving, such as drinking a magic potion, lighting a torch, using a magic item, or turning undead.
* If a condition reduces a creature’s speed, the reduction applies to all types of movement, including combat, encounter, expedition, and any special movement.

###### Escaping from the Grabbed, Restrained, and Wrestled Conditions

The grabbed, restrained, and wrestled conditions can be ended with a successful escape. An escape is a combat action.

When attempting to escape from being grabbed or wrestled, a creature has to two options. First, it can attempt to slip free with a size-adjusted Paralysis saving throw. Second, it can attempt to break free with a Dungeonbashing proficiency throw. If the creature has Contortionism proficiency, it gains a +4 bonus on either throw.

When attempting to escape from being restrained, a creature may in some cases have the option to slip free or break free, as above. Sometimes the creature might also or instead have the option to cut free by, e.g., slashing off the tentacle which is restraining it. To cut itself free, a creature must successfully deal a particular amount of damage (noted in the monster’s description) to the creature or appendage that has restrained it.

### Morale

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Monster Morale** | |
| **Adjusted Die Roll** | **Result** |
| 2- | Frightened Retreat |
| 3 – 5 | Morale Faltering |
| 6 – 8 | Fight On |
| 9 – 11 | Advance and Pursue |
| 12+ | Victory or Death |

Player characters always have a choice whether they will fight, surrender, or run away in an encounter. The Judge decides whether monsters surrender or run away. Monsters have a listing for **morale**, which represents how likely they are to fight or flee when in an encounter. Morale is rated from -6 to +4. A score of -6 indicates that the monster never fights (unless absolutely cornered), while a score of +4 indicates the monster will fight until killed.

The Judge makes a **morale roll** at the end of each round for a group when one-third the group has been killed or otherwise incapacitated, and each round thereafter that another creature in the group is killed, to determine if the monsters fight on. The Judge also makes a morale roll for a group at the end of the first round that the adventurers flee from it order to determine whether the monsters pursue.

The Judge makes a morale roll for a solitary creature when it loses one-third their hit points, and each round thereafter that the creature is damaged. He also makes a morale roll for the creature at the end of the first round that the adventurers all flee from it.

To make a morale roll, the Judge rolls 2d6, adding the morale rating of the monsters, along with any other adjustments he feels are reasonable, and consults the Monster Morale table. Suggested morale roll modifiers are as follows:

* Creature has lost 1/2 or more of its starting HP -2
* Creature has lost 2/3 or more of its starting HP -5
* Group outnumbers opponents +2
* Group outnumbers opponents by 2:1 or more +5
* Group has lost 1/2 or more of starting creatures -2
* Group has lost 2/3 or more of starting creatures -5
* Creature or group cannot retreat and enemy is not accepting surrender +5

###### Morale Results

**Frightened retreat** means that the creatures become **frightened**. Frightened creatures cannot attack, cast spells, or speak (except to scream in stark terror). They will run from the enemy at their full speed until they are no longer pursued by any enemies or 1d10 rounds passes. Frightened creatures that cannot flee begin **cowering** in terror. Engaged frightened creatures will cower in terror until able to flee with defensive movement. Cowering creatures are **vulnerable** and cannot attack, cast spells, move, or take any other actions until the condition ends. Cowering creatures will surrender if terms are offered.

**Morale faltering** means the creatures begin **faltering**. Faltering creatures suffer a -2 penalty to make attack throws, proficiency throws, or saving throws versus the enemy. The creatures stop falteringif, at the end of their initiative, they are no longer engaged by any enemies. Faltering creatures will usually attempt a fighting withdrawal to end the condition. Faltering creatures might surrender if offered fair and reasonable terms such as safe passage with their arms, etc. (Judge’s discretion).

**Fight On** means that the monsters will continue the battle without retreating, but they will not pursue if their opponents flee. **Advance and Pursue** means the monsters will continue the battle without retreating, going on the offensive where possible, and pursuing should the characters retreat. **Victory or Death** means the monsters will fight on without retreating or needing to roll morale for the remainder of the battle. They will pursue any retreating opponents, and fight with ferocity and grim determination.

If the adventurers attempt to **surrender** to their enemies, it is up to the Judge to decide whether the enemies even listen, and under what terms they will accept surrender. The adventurers can decide how to react if their opponents make attempts to surrender.

###### The Perils of Cowardice

Fear makes running more perilous. Any time a frightened or faltering combatant moves through a doorway, makes a hard turn around a corner, or traverses an obstacle at running speed, it must make a Paralysis saving throw. Adventurers with Acrobatics can add their class level to the save. If the save is failed, the combatant falls at that point and moves no further that round. If the save succeeds, the combatant can keep moving for the remainder of his action. Bad luck can cause even the swiftest combatant to fall prey to pursuing foes.

If the monsters are put to flight, the adventurers can run after them or let them escape, as they choose. If the adventurers flee, the monsters will pursue if their morale roll results in Advance and Pursue or Victory or Death, continuing to do so for as long as the adventurers are visible to them at the end of the monster’s initiative. If the monsters enjoy treasure, they must make a Paralysis saving throw at +4 if the adventurers drop treasure worth at least their XP value. Hungry monsters of bestial intelligence must do the same if the characters drop a day’s rations for the creature. If the save fails, the monster(s) stop(s) to snatch up the treasure or meal.

### Mounted Combat

A creature controlling a mount is called a **rider**. A creature seated on a mount, but not controlling it, is called a **passenger**. While combatants will rarely ride mounts in dungeons, they will often do so during wilderness encounters. The following rules apply during mounted combat.

###### Mounted Initiative and Movement

A rider and any passengers act on their own initiative number. A mount acts on the rider’s initiative number. The rider chooses what actions he and/or his mount undertake, unless it is frightened and fleeing. When the mount moves, the rider and passengers move with it, all using the mount’s speed. The rider and passengers are considered to have charged, retreated, run, or moved if the mount did so. (Therefore, a rider who wishes to cast spells must keep his mount stationary.) If either the rider or mount becomes **engaged**, both are considered engaged.

A rider or passenger can mount onto or dismount from a stationary mount as an action in lieu of attacking. A rider or passenger with Mounted Combat or Riding proficiency can mount onto or dismount from a stationary or moving mount as an action in lieu of movement. When mounting, the combatant must be within 5’ of the mount, which must not be hostile to him. When dismounting, the combatant can place himself anywhere within 5’ of the mount. A combatant dismounting from an aerial mount begins falling.

###### Mounted Attacks

If the mount moved but did not charge or take another full-round action, then either the rider, the passengers, or the mount can take a combat action (but not both). If the mount remained stationary, either the mount or both the rider and the passengers can take combat actions, but not all three. If the mount charged, then either the rider or the passengers can attack at the end of the charge, and the mount can usually also attack if war-trained. (Some mounts, such as camels, do not attack on a charge.) Riders and passengers with impact weapons will deal impact damage. Some mounts will deal impact damage, depending on their type.

If the mount remained stationary and the rider attacked with a missile weapon, the mount can take its movement action *after* the rider’s attack, as if the mount had readied a movement action triggered by the rider’s attack.

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | Mount Moved | Mount Stationary | Mount Charged |
| Rider | Can attack if passenger and mount don’t | Can attack if mount doesn’t | Can attack |
| Passenger | Can attack if rider and mount don’t | Can attack if mount doesn’t | Can attack |
| Mount | Can attack if rider and passenger don’t | Can attack if rider and passenger don’t;  Can move after rider’s missile attack | Can usually attack if war-trained |

A rider or passenger with Mounted Combat or Riding proficiency can stay mounted during attacks. However, a rider or passenger without one of those proficiencies must make a Paralysis saving throw after each attack he makes or the mount makes (including cleaves). If the save succeeds, he stays mounted. If the save fails, he is knocked off the mount. Combatants knocked off a mount are dismounted, knocked **prone**, and suffer 1d4 bludgeoning damage. Combatants knocked off an aerial mount into the sky takes no damage but begin falling.

If a rider or mount makes or is the target of a **force back** or **overrun** special maneuver, the mount’s size is used to determine the saving throw and effects.

A rider with Mounted Combat or Riding can take advantage of the mount’s height when attacking. Compare the size of the rider’s mount to the size of the target. (If the target is itself mounted, compare the size of the rider’s mount to the size of the target’s mount.) If the rider’s mount is larger, the target counts as **subjacent** to the rider.

###### Mounted Defenses

A rider or passenger without a military saddle must make a Paralysis saving throw every time they or the mount are dealt damage, unless they have both Riding and Mounted Combat proficiency. If the save succeeds, the rider or passenger stays mounted. If the save fails, the rider or passenger is knocked off the mount. If either the rider or mount is reduced to 0 hit points, everyone on the mount is automatically knocked off (as above).

If a mount fails a morale roll due to becoming injured, a rider with Mounted Combat or Riding proficiency can attempt to calm the mount as an action in lieu of attacking. This allows the mount to make a new morale roll at the end of the round.

### Vehicle Combat

A creature controlling a vehicle is called a **driver**. A creature riding on a vehicle under another’s control is called a **passenger**. A creature pulling a vehicle, carrying a vehicle with its hands and shoulders, or carrying a vehicle on its back, is called a **transporter**.The driver can be one of the transporters in some cases, e.g. the driver of a palanquin carrying a prisoner will be one of the transporters. The following rules apply during vehicular combat.

###### Vehicle Initiative, Movement, and Attacks

A driver and any passengers act on their own initiative number. Transporters act on the driver’s initiative number. The driver chooses what actions he and the transporters undertake, unless the transporters are frightened and fleeing. When the transporters move, the driver, passengers, and vehicle move with it, all using the vehicle’s speed. The rider and passengers are considered to have charged, retreated, run, or moved if the transporters did so. If either the driver or any transporters becomes **engaged**, all are considered engaged.

A rider or passenger can mount onto or dismount from a stationary vehicle as an action in lieu of attacking. A rider or passenger with Mounted Combat or Driving proficiency can mount onto or dismount from a stationary or moving vehicle as an action in lieu of movement. When mounting, the combatant must be within 5’ of the vehicle, whose transporters must not be hostile to him. When dismounting, the combatant can place himself anywhere within 5’ of the vehicle. A combatant dismounting from an aerial vehicle begins falling.

###### Vehicle Attacks

If the vehicle did not charge or take another full-round action, then driver and the passengers can take a combat action. The transporters cannot attack, with one exception: A transporter that is carrying the vehicle on its back can take a combat action. For instance, an elephant carrying a howdah can attack.

If the vehicle charged, the driver is busy driving and cannot attack. The passengers can make melee attacks at the end of the charge. The transporters can also make melee attack provided they are pulling the vehicle or carrying the vehicle on their back. For instance, a team of horses pulling a chariot or an elephant carrying a howdah could attack after the charge, but laborers carrying a palanquin could not. Passengers and transporters with impact weapons will deal impact damage.

If a vehicle is the target of a **force back** or **overrun** special maneuver, the vehicle’s size is used to determine the saving throw and effects.

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | Vehicle Didn’t Charge | Vehicle Charged |
| Driver | Can attack | Cannot attack |
| Passenger | Can attack | Can melee attack |
| Transporters | Can attack if carrying vehicle on back | Can melee attack if carrying on back or pulling vehicle |

###### Vehicles and Damage

If the vehicle is reduced to 0 structural hit points, everybody on it is automatically knocked off (as above). Transporters can ignore the frightened condition so long as less than half the transporters are also frightened.
