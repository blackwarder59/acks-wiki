## Elven Nightblade

Key Attribute: DEX and INT

Requirements: None

Hit Dice: 1d6

Maximum Level: 11

Elves are lithe, fey beings with pointed ears, delicate features, and graceful movement. They typically weigh about 130 lbs and stand between 5' 6" and 6' tall. Humans envy their long lifespans and seeming agelessness. They are a subtle race, and never does their gift for finesse and subtlety so reveal itself as in the practice of death-dealing. Cunning, deadly, and rarely seen, the elven nightblade is an assassin and sorcerer whose art is murder. Most nightblades practice their work in the courts of elven nobility. Those few who venture outside of the forests of Northern Argollë find their skills in high demand, for adventurers, aristocrats, and warlords all value their arcane and deadly ways.

### Combat Characteristics

Elven nightblades are professional killers, but they prefer to fight by ambush and treachery rather than direct confrontation.

**Combat Proficiencies:**. Elven nightblades have weapon proficiency with all missile weapons and with all tiny, small, and medium melee weapons. They have armor proficiency with light and very light armor. They have fighting style proficiency with the dual weapon and two-handed weapon styles, but not with the weapon and shield style.

**Combat Progression:** Elven nightblades advance in attack throws and saving throws as thieves, by two points every fourlevels of experience. They do not gain any bonus to damage as they advance in level. They can cleave after killing a foe a maximum of once per round per every two class levels (rounded down).

### Starting Class Powers

At the start of play, nightblades have the following class powers. As with thieves, the nightblade's skills improve as the nightblade gains levels according to the progression on the Elven Nightblade Skills table.

**Acrobatics:** Nightblades are trained to jump, tumble, somersault, and free-run around obstacles. They gain a +2 bonus to saving throws where agility would help avoid the danger, such as tilting floors and pit traps. They can add their class level to their DEX for purposes of the distance and height they can jump (p. XX). As his movement action, a nightblade can attempt a proficiency throw to tumble past an opponent he has engaged. If the throw fails, the character remains stationary. If it succeeds, he tumbles directly past his enemy into the space on the enemy's opposite side, ending up either facing towards or away from the opponent (player's choice). If the space on the enemy's opposite side is occupied, the nightblade cannot tumble.

If he ends up facing away from the opponent, he can make a combat movement in lieu of attacking if desired. If he ends up facing towards the opponent, he can attack (and possibly backstab) him. The nightblade cannot tumble if he has an encumbrance of more than 5 stone and cannot tumble past the same enemy on two consecutive rounds. (This class power is the equivalent of Acrobatics proficiency.)

**Backstabbing:** Nightblades are skilled at treacherously attacking unprepared enemies. A nightblade can backstab any **vulnerable** opponent. Backstabs can be made in melee or with missile weapons at short range, but cannot be made with missile weapons at medium or longer range. When backstabbing, a nightblade gains a +4 bonus to hit and if the attack succeeds, the nightblade deals an additional die of damage at 1st level, and another additional die at 5th, 9th, and 13th level**.**

**Climbing:** Nightblades are adept at scaling sheer surfaces, including smooth walls or steep cliffs. The nightblade must make a Climbing proficiency throw for each 100' climbed (with a minimum of one check required). If the throw succeeds, the nightblade can safely ascend or descend the distance. If the throw fails, the nightblade falls a distance equal to half the attempted distance, plus the distance covered by any previous throws, taking 1d6 bludgeoning damage per 10 feet. A nightblade can climb at his exploration speed or one-third his combat speed without penalty. If he moves at one-half combat speed, he takes a -5 penalty to the proficiency throw, and if he moves at full combat speed, he takes a -10 penalty. For further rules on climbing, see p. XX.

**Hiding:** Nightblades are trained to skulk unseen in the cover of darkness. A nightblade can begin hiding as a combat action anytime he is in cover, dim light, or darkness. When the nightblade begins hiding, the Judge must make a Hiding proficiency throw on behalf of the nightblade. A nightblade will always think he is successful in this skill, and will not know otherwise until others react to his presence. Regardless of whether the throw succeeds, opponents encountering the nightblade suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls as long as he remains stationary in cover, dim light, or darkness.

If the throw succeeds, the nightblade is **hidden**. If the throw fails, the nightblade is not hidden. No creature can claim line of sight on a nightblade that is hidden from it. If a hidden nightblade engages an unengaged opponent, the opponent cannot make a free facing change (p. XX). If an opponent knows the hidden nightblade's general location, the opponent can attack him in melee at a -4 penalty, but it cannot even blindly attack the nightblade if it doesn't knows his general location. The hidden condition expires at the end of the nightblade's initiative if he moves or attacks. It also terminates if the cover, dim light, or darkness no longer conceals the nightblade from his opponents.

**Shadowy Senses:** Since the bright light of torches will reveal their positions, nightblades learn to rely on superior night-vision, keen hearing and smell, and echolocation to slowly scout through dark alleys, lightless dungeons, and star-lit rooftops. When moving at combat speed or exploration speed, a nightblade can "see" as if he were carrying a light source that sheds dim light in a 30' radius. Shadowy senses can be used to fight, probe for traps, and so on. However, shadowy senses cannot be used to discern colors, faces, markings, or flat images (such as frescoes and murals) or to read books, maps, or scrolls. Shadowy senses does not function if the nightblade is charging or running, if deafened, or if in an area of bright light, magical darkness, or magical silence. Because it counts as dim light, an opponent can hide from shadowy senses.

**Sneaking:** Nightblades learn to prowl with great stealth. A nightblade can begin sneaking as a movement action. He can sneak at his encounter speed or one-half combat speed without penalty. If he moves greater than one-half combat speed, he takes a -5 penalty to the Sneaking proficiency throw. If he runs, he takes a -10 penalty.

When the nightblade begins sneaking, the Judge must make a Sneaking proficiency throw on behalf of the nightblade. A nightblade will always think he is successful in this skill, and will not know otherwise until others react to his presence. Regardless of whether the throw succeeds, opponents encountering the nightblade suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls if the nightblade is outside their line of sight.

If the throw succeeds, the nightblade is also **sneaking**. If the throw fails, the nightblade is not sneaking. When sneaking, the nightblade makes no noise when he moves — none whatsoever. Even alert creatures that make a successful Listening proficiency throw will not hear a sound. When a sneaking nightblade engages an unengaged opponent from the rear, the opponent cannot make a free facing change.

**Streetwise:** The nightblade has learned the hard lessons taught by life as a criminal. He might begin play as a member of an assassin's guild or other criminal syndicate (Judge's discretion). He can engage in hijinks if he has the necessary proficiencies or thief skills. He can automatically identify gestures, signs, slang, and territory of criminal organizations in his home settlement. He can identify those of other urban settlements with a proficiency throw of 11+. Secret organizations or organizations in far-off cities might be harder to recognize. (This class power is equivalent to one rank of Streetwise proficiency.)

### Additional Class Powers

When they advance in level, nightblades gain the following additional class powers:

**Arcane Magic (2nd level):** As magical assassins, elven nightblades learn and cast arcane spells. However, they are not as devoted to the arcane arts as mages, so their caster level and progression are at a slower rate. The nightblade's caster level, and the number and levels of spells the nightblade can cast in a single day, are listed on the Nightblade Spell Progression table. Like a mage, a nightblade's spell selection is limited to the spells in his **repertoire**. A nightblade's repertoire can include up to the number and level of spells listed for his level, increased by his Intellect bonus. Unlike (human) mages, an elven nightblade can cast spells while wearing light or very light armor.

**Quiet Magic (2nd level):** Nightblades can cast their spells with minimal words and gestures. A successful proficiency throw to hear noise is required to hear the nightblade cast spells. Full binding and gagging is necessary to prevent the nightblade from working magic. (This class power is the equivalent of Quiet Magic proficiency.)

**Minor Magical Research (7th level):** The elven nightblade can research spells, scribe magical scrolls, and brew potions as if he were a 5th level mage.

**Hideout (9th level):** By acquiring a **hideout** worth at least 5,000gp, the elven nightblade can attract followers to his service. 2d6 1st level elven nightblades will arrive to serve him as followers within 1d4 weeks of him acquiring the hideout. If the nightblade already has a hideout, the followers arrive to serve him within 1d4 weeks of him reaching 9th level. If hired, the followers must be paid standard rates for henchmen. These followers will serve the character with some loyalty, though at least one will be an infiltrator working for the nightblade's local rivals, sent to keep an eye on the character. A cunning and resourceful nightblade can use these followers to start a criminal syndicate. Additional rules for hideouts and syndicates are detailed in the **Campaigns** chapter.

### Racial Traits

As elves, nightblades have certain powers and drawbacks associated with their race.

**Attunement to Nature:** Elves gain a +1 bonus to surprise rolls when in the wilderness. When using the Adventuring proficiency to search or listen, they succeed on a proficiency throw of 14+ (instead of the usual 18+). If separately proficient in Searching they gain a +2 bonus to their throw instead. If separately proficient in Listening, they gain a +4 bonus to their throw instead.

**Connection to Nature:** Because of their connection to nature, elves are completely unaffected by diseases caused by undead, and gain a +1 bonus to Paralysis and Spells saving throws. Their robust vitality grants a +1 bonus to their HD roll at 1st level. (These adjustments are already factored into their HD and saving throws on the tables.)

**Elf Tongues:** Elves can speak the Common, Elven, Gnoll, Hobgoblin, and Orc languages.

### Class Proficiencies

**Proficiency Progression:** At 1st level, nightblades select one class proficiency from their class proficiency list and one general proficiency from the general proficiency list. They select an additional class proficiency at 4th and 8th level. They select an additional general proficiency at 5th and 9th level.

**Elven Nightblade Proficiency List:** Battle Magic, Beast Friendship, Black Lore of Zahar, Blind Fighting, Combat Reflexes, Contortionism, Counterspelling, Eavesdropping, Elementalism, Expanded Repertoire, Familiar, Fighting Style Specialization, Kin-Slaying, Magical Engineering, Mastery of Enchantments & Illusions, Mystic Aura, Passing Without Trace, Poisoning, Precise Shooting, Prestidigitation, Running, Sensing Power, Skirmishing, Skulking, Sniping, Swashbuckling, Unflappable Casting, Unarmed Fighting, Wakefulness, Weapon Focus, Weapon Finesse
