## Sieges, Simplified

It isn’t always important to know howa siege was fought — sometimes all that matter is who won and how long it took. The Duration of Siege table is designed for just these occasions!

To use the table, cross-reference the besieged stronghold’s structural hit points with the besieging army’s unit advantage. A numerical result indicates the number of days it will take the besieging army to capture the stronghold. A result of “0” indicates the stronghold is captured without a fight. A result of “-“ indicates that the besieging army is not strong enough to capture the stronghold and can hope only to starve out the defenders with a blockade.

Unit advantage is calculated by subtracting the number of units in the defending army from the number of units in the besieging army. Artillery and siege engines on either side count as bonus units, as shown on the adjacent table.

EXAMPLE: Moruvai’s stronghold (24,000 shp) is under siege by Marcus. Marcus has 50 units. He also has 4 light catapults and 2 light trebuchets. These count as [(4 x 1) + (2 x 8)] 20 bonus units, giving Marcus a total of 70 units. Moruvai’s army has 12 units. Moruvai also has 4 medium catapults, which count as (4 x 2) 8 bonus units. Moruvai has a total of 20 units. Marcus’s unit advantage is (70 - 20) 50 units. Cross referencing Marcus’ unit advantage of 50 with the stronghold’s 24,000 shp, the Judge sees that it will take 18 days for Marcus to capture Moruvai’s stronghold.

A stronghold situated on a mountain, island, or similar piece of inaccessible terrain is harder to capture than its structural hit points would indicate. Modify the duration of the siege as shown on the table below.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Stronghold Site** | **Duration Modifier** |
| Mountain (Sogdian Rock, the Acropolis) | x5 |
| Island (Tyre, Mont. St. Michel) | x4 |
| Peninsula (Constantinople) | x3 |
| Riverbank (Rhine river castles) | x2 |

EXAMPLE: If Moruvai’s stronghold were an island-fortress, it would take Marcus 72 days to capture it instead of 18.

To assess the casualties resulting from a completed siege, just resolve a battle (not an assault) between the besieging army and defending army. This represents, e.g., the defending army sallying forth when all hope is lost, the besieging army mopping up after the stronghold is reduced, and so on. Play the final battle as normal, with two exceptions related to morale collapse. Defending units which suffer a Flee result are assumed to be cowering in the rubble rather than actually putting any distance between themselves and the encircling attackers. Defenders which suffer a Rout result are considered to have surrendered to the besieging army, whose commander may determine the unit’s fate.

This table is especially useful for resolve sieges that are happening “off camera,” away from the activities of player characters. Should the PCs intervene in the siege, the Judge can calculate the state of the defending stronghold’s walls and supplies at the point when the PCs arrive. The stronghold will be reduced to 0 shp when the listed number of days has occurred, reduced to 50% of its shp when half the time has elapsed, and so on.

**Designer’s Note**: The unit bonus afforded by artillery in sieges is not intended to match up 1:1 with the Battle Rating provided by artillery used in assaults. Ballista are more accurate against enemy units that catapults and trebuchets, but catapults and trebuchets are more effective against structures. There’s mathematical magic behind the scenes that yields these numbers.
