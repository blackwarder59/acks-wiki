## Masterwork Equipment (Optional)

Working alone or with his subordinates, a grand master in an art or craft can create **masterwork items** appropriate to his art or craft. Such items can be nearly magical in their effectiveness.

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Item | Cost | Item | Cost |
| Masterwork Weapon (+1 to attack throw) | +80gp | Masterwork Structure (+1 AC) | x2 |
| Masterwork Weapon (+1 to damage) | +80gp | Masterwork Structure (+10% shp) | x2 |
| Masterwork Weapon (+1 to damage & attack throw) | +650gp | Masterwork Structure (+1 AC & +10% shp) | x4 |
| Masterwork Armor (-1 stone weight) | +80gp | Masterwork Ship (+1 AC) | x2 |
| Masterwork Armor (+1 AC) | +650gp | Masterwork Ship (+10% shp) | x2 |
| Masterwork Instrument (+1 Performance) | +80gp | Masterwork Ship (+10% speed) | x2 |
| Masterwork Instrument (+2 Performance) | +650gp | Masterwork Ship (+1 AC, +10% shp & speed) | x8 |

**Masterwork Weapon:** A masterwork weapon costing an additional 80gp can provide +1 to hit or +1 to damage. A masterwork weapon costing an additional 650gp can provide both +1 to hit and damage. In neither case does the weapon provide the ability to hit magical monsters, unless forged of a material otherwise capable of doing so (e.g. silver). Additional ornaments or engraving can add to the weapon’s value without necessarily increasing the weapon’s characteristics.

**Masterwork Armor:** A masterwork set of armor costing an additional 80gp weighs one less stone (armor or shields weighing one stone count as one item instead) while providing normal AC. A masterwork set of armor costing an additional 650gp provides +1 AC while weighing the same as normal. Additional ornaments or engraving can add to the value without necessarily improving the armor’s characteristics.

**Masterwork Instrument:** A masterwork instrument costing an additional 80gp adds +1 to Performance throws. A masterwork instrument costing an additional 650gp adds +2 to Performance throws.

**Masterwork Structures:** A masterwork structure costing 2 times normal gains +1 to AC or +10% to structural hit points. A masterwork structure costing 4 times normal gains both +1 to AC and +10% to structural hit points.

**Masterwork Ship:** A masterwork ship costing 2 times normal gains +1 to AC, +10% to structural hit points, or +10% to speed. A masterwork ship costing 4 times normal gains any two such benefits. A masterwork ship costing 8 times normal gains all three such benefits.

In addition to the above, a miscellaneous piece of masterwork art or craftsmanship may be of such beauty and quality as to be worth anywhere from 2 to 100 times normal value.

###### Availability of Masterwork Items

Check with your Judge before purchasing masterwork items. Their availability is at his discretion based on the particulars of his campaign setting. Because grandmasters are very rare, masterwork items might be absent from even large markets where they’d otherwise be available based on gp cost. For instance, in the ***AX3:*** ***Capital of the Borderlands***sourcebook, masterwork items are only available from specific in-game merchants that characters must befriend.

###### Masterwork and Magical Items

The process of making a weapon, shield or set of armor into a +1 or greater item automatically transforms it into a masterwork, so the bonuses do not stack. However, enchanting masterworks is easier than enchanting mundane items. Apply the value of the masterwork item towards the material cost of the item (see p. XX).
