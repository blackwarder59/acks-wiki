## Proficiencies

Proficiencies represent particular areas of expertise that your character has developed due to his background, homeland, and training. Each class has a **class** **list** of proficiencies, representing training that is particularly useful to the specific profession. In addition, there is a **general list** of proficiencies, which represent trade skills and knowledge that is widely available to all.

All characters begin with the Adventuring proficiency as well as one proficiency chosen from their class list and one proficiency chosen from the general list. Characters with an Intellect bonus may choose to begin the game knowing one or more additional proficiencies from the general list. During play, characters will learn proficiencies from both lists over time as they advance in level. Each class gains proficiencies at a different rate. See the **Proficiencies** chapter (p. XX) for more details.

### Adventuring Proficiency

The Adventuring proficiency grants your character the ability to do the following defined activities:

* Bash down stuck doors as a combat action by succeeding on a Dungeonbashing proficiency throw of 18+.
* Climb easy-to-scale obstacles such as ropes or branchy trees by succeeding on a Climbing proficiency throw of 8+.
* Methodically search for concealed traps, secret doors, buried treasure, and other hidden features by spending one turn (10 minutes) and succeeding on a Searching proficiency throw of 18+.
* Methodically disarm traps by spending one turn (10 minutes) and succeeding on a Trapbreaking proficiency throw of 18+.
* Pause and listen for noises by spending one round and succeeding on a Listening proficiency throw of 18+.

Write these target values down on your character sheet. Remember to apply 4x your character’s STR bonus or penalty to Dungeon Bashing throws, e.g. you adjust the target value by ±4/8/12. For more information on the Adventuring proficiency, see p. XX.
