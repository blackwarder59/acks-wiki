# Appendix B: Conditions

Conditions alter a creature’s capabilities in a variety of ways and can arise as a result of a spell, a class power, a proficiency, a monster’s attack, or other effect. Most conditions, such as **blinded**, are impairments, but a few, such as **invisible**, can be advantageous. A condition lasts either until it is countered (the **prone** condition is countered by standing up, for example) or for a duration specified by the effect that imposed the condition. If multiple effects impose the same condition on a creature, each instance of the condition has its own duration, but the condition’s effects don’t get worse (unless the imposing effect specifies otherwise). A creature either has a condition or doesn’t. The following definitions specify what happens to a creature while it is subjected to a condition.

### General Rules for Conditions

The following rules apply to all conditions, except where otherwise noted:

* A condition that prevents a creature from casting spells also prevents the creature from using spell-like abilities that require one full round or more, and from using scrolls.
* A condition that prevents a creature from moving also prevents the creature from taking actions in lieu of moving, such as standing up from being knocked down, sheathing one weapon and drawing another, readying or loosing a shield, picking an item off the ground, or retrieving an item from a pack or sack.
* A condition that prevents a creature from attacking also prevents the creature from taking actions in lieu of attacking that could not be taken as actions in lieu of moving, such as drinking a magic potion, lighting a torch, using a magic item, or turning undead.
* If a condition that reduces a creature’s speed, the reduction applies to all types of movement, including combat, encounter, long-distance, and any special movement.

###### Escaping from the Grabbed, Restrained, Webbed, and Wrestled Conditions

The grabbed, restrained, and wrestled conditions can be ended with a successful escape. Escaping is a combat action.

When attempting to escape from being grabbed or wrestled, a creature has to two options. First, it can attempt to slip free with a Paralysis saving throw. Second, it may attempt to break free with a Dungeonbashing proficiency throw. If the creature has Contortionism proficiency, it gains a +4 bonus on either throw. If the creature is grabbed, grappled, or restrained by a large or imposing creature, it suffer a penalty on this throw. In either case, if the throw succeeds, the creature has escaped.

When attempting to escape from being restrained or webbed, a creature may in some cases have the option to slip free or break free, as above. Sometimes the creature may also or instead have the option to cut free by, e.g., slashing off the tentacle which is restraining it or to burn away the webbing. To cut itself free, a creature must successfully deal a particular amount of damage (noted in the monster’s description) to the creature or appendage that has restrained it.

### List of Conditions

###### Beholding

* A creature is beholding another creature or effect when that creature or effect is in line of sight and within 10% of maximum visibility distance. (In normal conditions, the maximum visibility distance to a man-sized creature is 600’, so it can be beheld at 60’.)
* A creature can behold creatures using lightless vision, but not using echolocation, mechanoreception, or shadowy senses.
* At the start of its initiative, a creature can close its eyes to avoid beholding a creature or effect or open its eyes if currently doing so. A creature that is closing its eyes is considered **blinded** until it stops closing its eyes.

###### Berserk

* A berserk creature gains a +2 bonus to attack throws in melee and with thrown weapons.
* A berserk creature becomes immune to the cowering, faltering, or frightened conditions and never checks morale.

It cannot conduct defensive movement to retreat or withdraw from an enemy within 5’ and cannot move in such a way that the range between itself and the nearest visible threat would increase. It must advance 5’ after cleaving if necessary to do so to engage an enemy and he has sufficient movement.
* The berserk condition ends when combat ends, and cannot be ended before then.

###### Bewitched

* A bewitched creature believes that the caster who bewitched it is a beloved friend.
* A bewitched creature will interpret anything the caster says in the most favorable manner.

###### Blessed/Inspired

* A blessed or inspired creature gains a +1 bonus to attack throws, armor class, morale rolls, and saving throws against fear.

* The condition is also ended immediately if the creature attacks, casts a spell, moves more than one-half its combat movement distance during a round, moves more than its exploration speed during a turn, or moves more than one-half its expedition speed during a day. Taking an action in lieu of moving, however, does not end the condition, nor does moving at exploration speed.

###### Concentrating and Stationary

* A concentrating and stationary creature is able to sustain a continuous spell or effect which requires stationary concentration.
* The condition ends if the creature takes damage or fails a saving throw (except a secret saving throw).

* Only living creatures can be affected by this condition.

###### Enervated

* An enervated creature must make a Death saving throw each day when it wakes from 8 hours of restful sleep. If the creature rests in a pinnacle of good (see ***ACKS JJ****,* p. XX), it gains a bonus to its save: +1 for an illuminated pinnacle, +2 for a hallowed pinnacle, and +4 for a sacrosanct pinnacle. If the creature does not gain 8 hours of restful sleep in a day, it automatically fails the save. If the save fails, the creature permanently reduces its maximum hit points by another point. If the save succeeds, the creature does not reduce its maximum hit points further that day. If the save succeeds three times in a row, the condition ends. A creature unlucky enough to be reduced to 0 maximum hit points by this condition is slain.
* A creature can end the condition and restore its maximum hit point total by being healed with ritual magic. A creature that advances in level can re-roll its maximum hit points using its full hit dice, but leveling itself does not end the enervated condition.

###### Engaged

* An engaged creature cannot charge and has a limited range of movement actions. It cannot march, stand up, or take cover. It can remain stationary and turn to face an engaging opponent.

* A mad creature which is restrained, imprisoned, alone, or otherwise can’t carry out the indicated action does nothing but babble incoherently.
* In all other cases, a mad creature must roll randomly on its initiative number each round to determine its actions. The exact table rolled on depends on the source of the madness.

###### Restrained

* A restrained creature cannot move, but can still attack, cast spells, take actions in lieu of attacking or moving, or attempt to escape.
* The opponent which restrained the creature can automatically deal damage on its initiative each round to the restrained creature without having to make an attack throw. Doing so counts as the opponent’s attack with whatever special natural weapon it used to restrain the creature. The restrained creature still receives a saving throw against any special effects of the attack (such as poison, etc.).
* A restrained creature also has the **vulnerable** condition while it is restrained.
* Sometimes a creature can be restrained by multiple causes (such as several tentacles); when this occurs, the restrained creature suffers an additional -1 penalty on its attack throws for each additional cause of restraint, in addition to the effects above.
* While a creature is restrained, the opponent which restrained it can move itself (bringing the restrained creature with it), but the restrained creature’s weight (lbs / 10) is applied as stones of encumbrance to the opponent. If the restrained creature’s weight causes the opponent to exceed its maximum load, the opponent cannot move. Regardless of encumbrance, however, the opponent cannot charge or run unless the restrained creature is at least one size category smaller than the opponent.
* If a creature is restrained by long appendages (such as tentacles), the opponent which restrained it can, in lieu of an attack with that appendage, move the creature with its appendages while remaining stationary itself. Some creatures may have the speed at which they can move restrained opponents listed; if not otherwise noted, a restrained creature can be moved at the same rate as the opponent’s combat speed, subject to encumbrance. The restrained creature’s weight (lbs / 10) is applied as stones of encumbrance to the opponent’s appendage(s). Calculate the normal load for the opponent’s appendage(s) as (creature’s normal load x number of appendages restraining creature / total number of appendages) for purposes of calculating the rate at which the restrained creature can be moved.
* The restrained condition is ended immediately when the restrained creature escapes or when the creature which restrained it releases it. If restrained by multiple causes, each must be escaped separately.
* Oozes and similarly amorphous creatures, as well as incorporeal creatures, are immune to this condition.

* Sometimes a creature can be webbed by multiple causes (such as several separate attacks); when this occurs, the restrained creature suffers an additional -1 penalty on its attack throws for each additional cause of webbing, in addition to the effects above. If the penalty reaches -3, the creature becomes **grabbed**.
* The webbed condition is ended immediately when the webbed creature escapes by slipping free or breaking free, or if the web is cut or burned away. If a creature has been webbed multiple times, it must slip free, break free, cut, or burn each web separately.
* Slipping free requires a successful Paralysis saving throw. If the save succeeds, the creature escapes. If the save fails, creature becomes more entangled in the webs, leaving it **helpless**.
* Breaking free requires a successful Dungeonbashing proficiency throw at -9. Large creatures gain a +4 bonus, huge creatures gain a +8 bonus, gigantic creatures gain a +12 bonus, and colossal creatures gain a +16 bonus. If the throw succeeds, the creature escapes. If the throw fails, the creature remains webbed (but does not become helpless).
* Webbed creatures can free themselves, and grabbed, helpless, and webbed creatures can be freed, by cutting the webbing or setting it aflame. Cutting webbing off a creature is an attack and requires a successful attack throw vs. AC 4 with a weapon dealing extraordinary slashing damage. If the attack throw succeeds, the creature is no longer webbed. Setting fire to the webbing is an attack and requires an attack throw against AC 0 with the fire source. If the attack succeeds, the webs instantly go up in flames. All creatures in the webbing immediately take 1d8 mundane fire damage at the start of their initiative until they escape the webbing. The webbing burns away at the end of two rounds.

* While a creature is wrestled, the opponent which wrestled it can move (bringing the wrestled creature with it), but the wrestled creature’s weight in stones is applied as encumbrance to the opponent. If the wrestled creature’s weight causes the opponent to exceed its maximum load, the opponent cannot move. Regardless of encumbrance, however, the opponent cannot charge or run unless the wrestled creature is at least one size category smaller than the opponent.
* A wrestled creature is **vulnerable**.
* The wrestled condition is ended immediately when the wrestled creature escapes or when the creature which wrestled it releases it or performs a force back or knock down.
