## Army Troops

The troops in an army can be drawn from five sources: **mercenaries**, **conscripts**, **militias**, **followers**,and **vassal troops**.

### Mercenaries

**Mercenaries** are hired soldiers that will guard, patrol, and campaign for anyone who pays their fee. Unlike conscripts and militias, which are levied involuntarily, mercenaries must be found and recruited to serve in an army.

###### Availability of Mercenaries in Markets

All characters can hire small numbers of mercenaries from markets to serve in their armies (p. XX). The availability of mercenaries will depend on the market class within which they are recruited, as noted on the Hireling Availability by Market Class table (p. XX). Mercenaries will be of the prevailing race of the settlement they are recruited from (usually human). Dwarven and elven troops may only be found in dwarven and elven settlements. Beastmen troops may only be found in Chaotic-aligned settlements. Certain troops can only be found when the realm lies within particular types of climates, or consists of particular types of terrain. For instance, camel archers are only available in desert realms.

###### Availability of Mercenaries from the Realm

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Realm**  **Size** | **Cost Per Time Period**  **Per Mercenary Type** |
| Continent | 6d10 x 1,000gp |
| Empire | 2d6+1 x 1,000gp |
| Kingdom | 4d12 x 100gp |
| Principality | 5d6 x 100gp |
| Duchy | 4d20 x 10gp |
| County | 4d10 x 10gp |
| Viscounty | 2d4 x 10gp |
| Barony | 2d6+1gp |

A domain or realm leader, or a character acting with the permission of the leader, can recruit mercenaries from throughout his entire realm to serve in his army. Doing so takes longer than recruiting from markets but yields many more troops. The Mercenary Availability by Realm Size table shows how many of each type of mercenary is available in each size of realm and what time period is required to recruit them. Only one character can recruit mercenaries in any one domain or realm at a time. Availability restrictions by race, climate, and terrain are identical to those from settlements (above). Note that the listed realms are of minimum population for their type; if the realm is larger than the listed population, scale up proportionately.

One half of the realm’s crop of mercenaries (rounded up) become available within the first time period after the leaders begin mustering troops. Another quarter (rounded down, minimum 1) become available during the second time period. The remainder of the crop becomes available in the third period. The crop of mercenaries available in the realm replenishes at the end of the fourth time period. (Replenishment represents younger sons deciding to become warriors, veterans leaving military life to become sellswords, foreign mercenaries being attracted by the opportunities for gold, etc.)

EXAMPLE: The Tarkaun of Aura, an empire with a population of 5,600,000 families, wants to hire all the heavy infantry mercenaries in his realm. A total crop of (5,600,000 / 1,500,000 x 13,000) 48,000 heavy infantry can be hired. He begins mustering mercenaries in the spring of the Year 381. In the first season (spring), a crop of 24,000 heavy infantry are available. In the second season (summer), a crop of 12,000 more heavy infantry become available. In the third season (fall), another crop of 12,000 heavy infantry become available. At the end of the fourth season (winter), the crop of heavy infantry available replenishes to 48,000.

As with finding and hiring mercenaries in markets, there is a gp cost associated with finding and hiring mercenaries in a realm. Each time period that the adventurer is recruiting mercenaries in his domain or realm, he must pay the fee listed on the adjoining table. This fee is per type of mercenary.

###### Availability of Military Specialists in the Realm

A domain or realm leaders (or representative thereof) can also recruit military specialists from throughout the domain or realm to serve in their armies. The Military Specialist Availability by Realm Size table shows how many of each type of specialist is available in each size of realm and how long they take to arrive. As with mercenaries, the listed realms are of minimum population for their type and can be scaled up for larger realms. The specialists arrive at the same rate as mercenaries, and as with finding and hiring mercenaries in a realm, there is a gp cost associated with finding and hiring specialists throughout the realm. The fee is identical to that for recruiting mercenaries.

###### Hiring Mercenaries and Specialists

Just because mercenaries and specialists are available does not mean they will automatically serve the character. Mercenaries must be recruited through negotiation, as per the rules in **Recruiting Hirelings**(p. XX). However, leaders raising armies generally hire large numbers of mercenaries and specialists at once, making it far too time-consuming to recruit them individually. The Judge will divide the mercenaries into formations of companies (120), battalions (500), or brigades (2,000) for purposes of rolls on the Reaction to Hiring Offer table. The Judge might assign some specialists to particular mercenary units.

EXAMPLE: The Tarkaun of Aura is attempting to recruit 24,000 heavy infantry mercenaries. The Judge divides these into 12 brigades of 2,000 mercenaries each. The Tarkaun rolls 12 times on the Reaction to Hiring Offer table. 11 of the heavy infantry brigades accept his offer, meaning he has recruited 22,000 mercenaries.

After they are hired, mercenaries must be paid the monthly wages listed on the Mercenary Gp Wage per Monthtable, below. Note that troops with alternative arms and armor or experience might have a better or worse wage. See the **Troop Characteristic Summaries** (p. XX)for examples.

| Mounted Crossbowmen | - | 55 | - | - | - | - | - | - |  | - | - |
| Beast Riders | - | - | - | - | 45 | 85 | - | - | - | - | - |

If a realm’s entire crop of mercenaries of a particular type is hired, multiple leaders attempt to recruit mercenaries at the same time, or background events in the campaign cause mercenaries to be in demand, the wages that mercenaries demand might increase (Judge’s discretion).

###### Mercenary Morale and Loyalty

Like all hirelings, an army’s mercenaries and specialists have **morale scores** and **loyalty scores.** Morale score is the mercenary’s confidence in battle. Mercenary morale is based on their training and equipment, as shown on the table below. Morale rolls (but not the base score) are modified by the commander’s **morale modifier** (p. XX) when he leads them in battle. Loyalty is the mercenary’s fidelity to his employer. Mercenary officers have a base loyalty score of -2. Mercenary troops and other types of specialists have a loyalty score of 0. Loyalty scores are permanently modified by the leader’s Charisma modifier.

The same rules for morale and loyalty apply as they do to hirelings retained by adventurers (p. xx), except as noted hereafter. When fielding armies, morale rolls and loyalty scores are tracked and rolled on a unit-by-unit base for events that occur to the unit.

Morale rolls for units are made during battles when casualties exceed an army’s break point (p. XX). Loyalty rolls for units are made any time the unit suffers a **calamity**. A calamity includes routing from a battle, suffering 25% or greater casualties, being out of supply for a week, or going without pay for a month. If the troops are suffering from more than one calamity at once, there is a -2 penalty on the die roll per calamity after the first.

| Mounted Crossbowmen | - | +1 | - | - | - | - | - | - |  | - | - |
| Beast Riders | - | - | - | - | +1 | +2 | - | - | - | - | - |

The effect of loyalty rolls on units are slightly different than their effect on individuals. Refer to the Unit Loyalty table. **Hostility** means that the unit as a whole considers their former employer to be an enemy. The troops will immediately leave his service. If their erstwhile leader is personally vulnerable, the mercenaries might attack him or stage a coup. If the character is opposed by a strong enemy, they will seek employment with the enemy leader.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Unit Loyalty** | |
| **Adjusted Die Roll (2d6)** | **Result** |
| 2- | Hostility |
| 3 – 5 | Resignation |
| 6 – 8 | Grudging Loyalty |
| 9 – 11 | Loyalty |
| 12+ | Fanatic loyalty |
| Roll whenever a calamity occurs (routing from a battle, 25% or greater casualties, loss of supply, no pay for a month) | |

**Resignation** means that the unit has decided to leave the leader’s service. If possible they will resign at an advantageous moment, such as right after being paid or reaching a safe stronghold, but in no circumstances will they risk a further battle or calamity.

**Grudging Loyalty** means the unit is reluctant to continue in the leader’s service, but sees no better options. If a result of grudging loyalty is rolled on two consecutive morale rolls, the mercenaries will leave the character’s service.

**Loyalty** means that the mercenaries will continue in the character’s service with enthusiasm. **Fanatic Loyalty** means the mercenaries have become dedicated and sworn servants of the character. All future loyalty rolls will be at +1. Fanatic Loyalty can never result from going without pay — treat such results as Loyalty.

###### Mercenary Veterans

Most mercenary units try to avoid actual warfare, preferring to be deployed to patrols, garrisons, and punitive expeditions against peasants. After all, real fighting leads to real dying, and dead mercenaries collect no wages! As a result, the average human mercenary is a 0th level normal man (1-1 HD, attack throw 11+, damage by weapon).

Mercenary units with experience of real war are known as **veterans**. Veterans will generally be 1st level fighters or explorers. They will have morale scores 1 point higher than the base morale for their troop type. If recruited into a leader’s army, veterans must be paid a higher wage because of their scarcity and prowess. Up to 25% of human mercenaries hired (e.g. 100 out of every 400) may be veterans.

**Designer’s Note:** Veterans make up 25% of a human army. Owing to their longer life spans, demi-humans have twice as many leveled characters as humans, but their mercenaries cost around twice as much. Thus, for every given domain size, demi-humans armies will have half as many troops as a human army, but all of those troops will be veterans. Dwarven and elven militia are the equivalent of human regulars. Higher-level dwarven, elven, and human troops are assumed to be in positions of command, support, and so on.

### Conscripts

The leader of a domain can permanently **conscript** peasants into his army. Up to 1 conscript per 10 peasant families can be levied without impacting domain morale or domain revenue. This conscription can be done all at once, or over a period of time. If the number of peasant families changes, the available number of conscripts likewise changes — a reduction in population means that some conscripts will have to be released from service, while an increase in population allows for increased conscription. If conscripts are killed, they can only be replaced through population growth, so leaders should track conscript casualties.

EXAMPLE: When the campaign begins, Marcus’s domain has 1,000 families. He can conscript and maintain a standing army of 100 conscripts from his domain. Six months later, Marcus has lost 50 conscripts to battle, but his domain has grown to 1,200 families. He can recruit an additional 20 conscripts (from the 200 families that joined his domain), giving him 70 conscripts.

When recruited, conscripts will carry no weapons or armor, have 1d4 hit points each, have morale scores of -2, and fight as normal men. Unless trained, they can only be equipped with spears, clubs, quarterstaffs, or daggers. Conscripts must be paid wages of 3gp per month. Conscripts who are better equipped and trained must be paid more (see below).

When a leader levies conscripts, it will take time for them to become available for his use, based on the size of realm. One half the requested conscripts (rounded up) will arrive within the first time period after the leader begins conscription. Another quarter (rounded down, minimum 1) will arrive during the second time period. The remainder of the conscripts becomes available in the third period.

**Designer’s Note:** Most ***ACKS***campaigns only cover 3 to 5 years of action. In long term campaigns that encompass many years of gameplay, the Judge can optionally replace casualties by 5% of the recruitable amount each year. For instance, with 1,000 families Marcus could replenish (100 x .05) = 5 conscripts each year from the 50 he’d lost. After ten years, he’d have made good his losses.

###### Training Conscripts

Once levied, conscripts can be trained to become professional troops in the same varieties as exist for mercenaries (e.g. light infantry, horse archers, etc.). However, not every conscript can qualify to become every type of troop. Some lack any talent with animals, and cannot become cavalry; others are nearsighted and cannot become archers, for instance.

Any peasant able-bodied enough to be conscripted in the first place can be trained to be light infantry. 50% of conscripts have the fitness and discipline to be heavy infantry. 50% have the agility and vision to be slingers, bowmen or crossbowmen. Up to 25% have the skill and seat to be light cavalry and only two-thirds of those (17% of the total) to be medium cavalry. Longbowmen must be drawn from those with the qualities of both heavy infantry and bowmen, so only 25% of conscripts can qualify. Horse archers must be drawn from those capable of being both bowmen and cavalry, so only 12.5% can qualify. Heavy cavalry must be drawn from those capable of being both heavy infantry and medium cavalry, so only 8.5% can qualify. Cataphract cavalry must be drawn from those capable of being heavy infantry, bowmen, and medium cavalry, so only 5% can qualify.

Forces drawn from elven, dwarven, and humanoid racial stock follow similar rules at slightly different breakdowns. The Qualifying Number of Conscripts table summarizes these results, showing the number of each type of troop that can recruited from a pool of 120 conscripts. The Judge can create additional tables to create specialized nations or races. For instance, conscripts from a pseudo-Mongolian kingdom might all qualify as cavalry.

Training troops takes time, ranging from one month for light infantry to a full year for cataphract cavalry. During this time, the leader who levied the troops incurs costs for ammunition, training gear, **marshals** (p. XX), and so on. He must also provide equipment for the troops.

**Naval Conscripts:** Littoral domains can train conscripts to be sailors, rowers, or marines. Training sailors or rowers has the same time and gp cost as training light infantry. Training marines adds 1 month and 10gp in training cost to the marine’s mercenary type.

###### Conscript Morale

Like mercenaries, conscripts have morale scores representing their willingness to fight and loyalty scores measuring their fidelity to the leader. When first levied, conscripts have a base morale of -2 and loyalty of 0. After they are trained, conscripts have a base morale appropriate to their troop type.

Conscripts levied from domains with Steadfast or Stalwart domain morale gain a one-time +1 increase to their morale and loyalty scores. Conscripts levied from domains with Apathetic or Demoralized domain morale suffer a one-time -1 decrease to their morale and loyalty scores.

Conscripts make morale rolls during battles when casualties exceed their army’s break point, and loyalty rolls any time the conscripts suffer a calamity. (Remember, a calamity includes routing from a battle, suffering 25% or greater casualties, being out of supply, or going without pay for a month.)

When a loyalty roll is called for, use the Unit Loyalty table (p. XX). Since conscripts cannot voluntarily leave their leader’s service, hostility and resignation represent rebellion and desertion, respectively. If conscripts are released from service by their leader, trained conscripts will become mercenaries or brigands, while untrained conscripts will return to their farms.

### Militia

In addition to conscripting peasants, the leader of a domain can also levy a **peasant militia**. Up to 2 additional peasants per 10 families can be levied into the militia. For each peasant levied, domain revenues are reduced by one family, from loss of able-bodied manpower. Domain morale is also reduced by 1 point by levying 1 or fewer peasants per 10 families, and by 2 points by levying 2 peasants per 10 families. These penalties remain until the militia is sent home. If militia are killed, they can only be replaced through population growth, so leaders should track militia casualties. Militia arrive at the same rate as conscripts.

EXAMPLE: Marcus needs more troops than just 70 conscripts. He decides to call up 2 militia per 10 families, yielding him (1,200 / 10 x 2) 240 militia. Marcus’s domain will now produce revenue as if it has (1,200 – 240) 960 families, and his domain morale is reduced by 2 points. After a tough campaign season in which 80 militia are lost, the surviving 160 militia return home. This ends the domain morale penalty. However, if Marcus wants to call up his militia again, he now has only 160 to draw on, at least until his domain gains new families.

###### Training Militia

When recruited, militia have no weapons or armor, have only 1d4 hit points each, fight as normal men, and have -2 morale. Militia can be improved through training, like conscripts. (Littoral domains can train militia as marines, rowers, or sailors.) They must be paid wages of 3gp per month while called up (or more if they are trained).

If militia are trained and then sent home, they will take their equipment with them. When the militia are called up again, they will respond to the call with their equipment and be able to fight as the appropriate troop type. Trained militia will have the same characteristics as mercenaries of their type. They must be paid wages appropriate to their troop type when called up. The gold piece value of a trained and equipped militia can be applied against the garrison cost of a domain, even if the militia is not called up (p. XX)

EXAMPLE: Marcus has called up 240 militia prior to the outbreak of war, so that he can train them. 50% qualify to be trained as heavy infantry, which takes 1 month and 124gp each. The other 50% are trained as light infantry, taking 1 month and 94.5gp each. His total cost is [(120 x 124) + (120 x 94.5)] 26,220gp. (In addition he has lost out on the domain revenue he’d have gained during this time, as noted above). However, should Marcus go to war in the future, when he calls up his militia he has a fighting force of 120 light infantry and 120 heavy infantry, rather than just a poorly-armed peasant levy. In addition, he can apply their implicit wages of 2,160gp towards his garrison cost.

Once equipped, the members of a peasant militia are assumed to pass their arms and skills on to their heirs when they become no longer capable of serving. This assumption frees the Judge from tracking the age of each militia member and accounting for their deaths due to disease and so on.

Training and equipping a militia is a very expensive proposition. It also carries a risk. Should the domain’s morale ever become Turbulent, Defiant, or Rebellious (p. xxx), any rebels will be drawn from the militia. This means an unfortunate or uncharismatic leader might find himself fighting heavily armed, well trained forces rather than peasant rabble.

###### Militia Morale

Militia morale and loyalty scores are similar to those of conscripts. When first levied, militias have a base morale of -2. If trained, militias have a base morale appropriate to their troop type. Militias levied from domains with Steadfast or Stalwart domain morale gain a one-time +1 bonus to their morale and loyalty scores. Militias levied from domains with Apathetic or Demoralized domain morale suffer a one-time -1 penalty to their morale and loyalty scores.

Militia make morale rolls during battles when casualties exceed their army’s break point, and loyalty rolls any time the militia suffer a calamity. A calamity includes routing from a battle, suffering 25% or greater casualties, being out of supply, or going without pay for a month. In addition, militias also consider each full season of continuous campaigning to be a calamity.

When a loyalty roll is called for, use the Unit Loyalty table (p. XX). Like conscripts, militias cannot voluntarily leave their leader’s service, but may desert, betray, or attack the leader. If militia are voluntarily released from service by their leader, they will return to their farms.

### Clanhold Warriors

In sedentary agricultural civilizations, only a small fraction of the able-bodied men serve in the realms’ armies. In barbaric cultures, all able-bodied men (and some women) serve as **clanhold warriors**. The chief of a clanholdcan levy these clanhold warriors into his personal army. The chief of a realm of clanholds can use the “call to arms” favor to levy clanhold warriors from his vassals.

Up to 1 clanhold warrior per peasant family can be levied without impacting clanhold morale or revenue. The levy can be done all at once or over a period of time. If the number of peasant families changes, the available number of clanhold warriors likewise changes — a reduction in population means that some clanhold warriors will have to be released to return to their villages, while an increase in population means new warriors can be rallied to serve. If clanhold warriors are killed, they can only be replaced through population growth, so leaders should track clan warrior casualties.

When mustered, clanhold warriors arrive at the same rate as conscripts but are already trained and equipped as customary for their tribe. One-third of clanhold warriors levied are veterans instead of the usual one-fourth. While serving the chief, clanhold warriors do not have to be paid wages. However, they will expect spoils of war in order to continue service.

###### Clanhold Warrior Morale

Clanhold warriors have a base morale appropriate to their troop type. Clanhold warriors levied from clanholds with Steadfast or Stalwart domain morale gain a one-time +1 increase to their morale scores. Clanhold warriors levied from clanholds with Apathetic or Demoralized domain morale suffer a one-time -1 decrease to their morale scores. Clanhold warriors may have additional bonuses or penalties to morale based on working conditions, just as with mercenaries.

Clanhold warriors make morale rolls during battles when casualties exceed their army’s break point, and loyalty rolls any time the warriors suffer a calamity. Clanhold warriors also must make loyalty rolls each time they serve for three consecutive months without receiving spoils from a battle or siege at least equal to their wages.

When a loyalty roll is called for, use the Unit Loyalty table (p. XX). Clanhold warriors who leave their leader’s service will return to their clanhold if possible, but become brigands/mercenaries if not.

### Followers

The leader of a domain may have attracted followers that he can deploy into his army. The Followers Type and Equipment by Class table (p. XX) lists the arms and equipment of various types of followers.

###### Follower Morale

Like other types of troops, followers have a morale and loyalty score, which represents their willingness to fight and die for the leader. The loyalty score for followers is +2, or +4 for fanatical followers. Loyalty scores are permanently modified by the leader’s Charisma modifier. The morale score for followers is the same as for a mercenary of their type, or +4 for fanatical followers. Morale rolls (but not the base score) are modified by the commander’s **morale modifier** (p. XX

Followers make morale rolls during battles when casualties exceed their army’s break point, and loyalty rolls any time the followers suffer a calamity. When a loyalty roll is called for, use the Unit Loyalty table (p. XX). As with mercenaries, a calamity includes routing from a battle, suffering 25% or greater casualties, being out of supply, or going without pay for a month.

A crusader or bladedancer’s followers do not have to make loyalty rolls when suffering calamities, but still have to make morale rolls during battles. Other followers must make loyalty rolls when suffering calamities as usual.

### Vassal Troops

The leader of a realm does not have direct access to the mercenaries, conscripts, militias, or slave soldiers employed by his **vassals**. To access these troops, the leader of a realm must make a **call to arms** to his vassals. When a call to arms is issued, the vassal must muster a force at least equal to half the garrison of his realm. If desired, the leader can call for the vassal to send their full garrison, but doing so counts as demanding two duties and may provoke a Loyalty roll as described in **Favors and Duties** in Chapter 6 of ***ACKS***(p. 130). The Henchman Morale roll can be avoided by offering a boon of some sort to the vassal, as usual.

Note that when a leader makes a call to arms to a vassal, the vassal is required to muster forces based on the garrison of the vassal’srealm*,* not the vassal’s domain. The vassal will be expected to muster more than just the forces of his personal domain — it is the vassal’s responsibility in turn to issue calls to his own vassals. These sub-vassals may, in turn, call upon their own vassals for troops, and so on. In this way, the forces of an entire kingdom can be mobilized, one tier at a time.

Any particular domain’s garrison will be made up of some mix of followers, mercenaries, conscripts, and militia. The exact mix will be determined by the Judge or the player character who rules the domain.

###### Vassal Troops by Realm Size

The approximate value and number of troops available to realm leaders of various sizes is listed below on the Vassal Troops by Realm Size table. This table can be used to quickly determine the armies that can be fielded by realms of various sizes.

In most cases, a leader will not muster the maximum number of vassal troops, for several reasons. First, doing so would require him to either provoke a substantial number of Henchmen Morale rolls or offer a substantial number of gifts to vassals to avoid those rolls (see **Favors and Duties**, p. XX, for details on this). Second, huge armies are expensive to supply, being effectively cities on the march (See Chapter 10, **Supply**, p. XX). Mustering a huge army can bankrupt a realm. Third, in the unfortunate event that the realm’s army is defeated, the leader will have no forces with which to continue the war or maintain his rule. Most leaders will muster the minimum force necessary for a given conflict, or even better, allow the conflict to be settled by forces available to a vassal at the point of conflict.

The Vassal Troops by Realm Size table assumes garrison expenditures of 2gp per peasant family each month. Borderlands and outlands domains will have more troops, as will highly militarized societies. A realm engaged in “total war” might have a garrison 50 – 100% larger than listed.

| Baron | 1 | 120-200 | 320gp | 240 – 400gp | 12 – 20 | Week |

###### Time Required

When a call to arms is issued, one half the requested troops (rounded up) will arrive within the first time period after the leader begins mustering troops. Another quarter (rounded down, minimum 1) will arrive during the second time period. The remainder of the troops becomes available in the third period.

The lengthy amount of time required to muster troops must be weighed against the costs and risk of doing so. The long period of time required for vast empires and kingdoms to raise all their forces is another reason why many leaders opt to have battles settled by lower-rank vassals close to the action.

Troops called to arms will generally muster at the realm leader’s stronghold, unless ordered to muster elsewhere. If the realm is highly dispersed geographically, or its constituent domains have been isolated by enemy troops, troops may not be able to muster in one place. The Judge should use his discretion in determining where troops will rendezvous in these cases.

###### Standing Armies

Rather than rely on vassals troops, a leader might maintain a standing army instead. A standing army sufficient to protect a realm is very expensive, usually requiring the leader to demand Scutage from his vassals of 1gp or more per peasant family. Each gp levied counts as demanding a duty, so levies of 2gp or more may provoke Henchman Morale rolls by the vassals, just as calling up troops will. However, the ruler can mollify his vassals by placing troops in their domains under their (delegated) control using the Troops favor.

Standing armies tend to be parceled out across the realm to supplement the garrisons of vassal rulers in threatened areas, so in practice there may be little distinction between a standing army and an army of vassal troops. If parceled out, the same time is required as with other vassal troops. The biggest difference between the two may be the nature of the troops. Leaders who rely on their vassals to provide troops can expect to get conscripts recruited from the various domains of their realms, while leaders who maintain standing armies usually hire mercenaries.

### Elite Troops (Optional)

From time to time, army leaders might attempt to find and recruit troops that have all been taught a particular class power or proficiency, such as Precise Shooting or Skirmishing. The rules for these **elite troops** can be found in *Axioms 4: War.* When all of the troops in a unit know the same proficiency, it affects their unit characteristics when using *Domains at War: Battles.* If you are not using the optional mechanics found in *Axioms 4* and *D@W:B,* just note:

* Elite troops cost an additional 1gp per month for every 6gp of regular wage, with a minimum additional monthly wage of 3gp.
* Elite troops gain a +1 bonus to their attack throws during their battle turn (p. XX).
