## Politics and Power

Whether it be the Athenian Council of 500, the Senate of Rome, or the Great Council of the Serene Republic of Venice, many of history’s greatest realms have been advised or ruled by deliberative bodies drawn from the aristocratic classes. In ***ACKS II***these bodies are referred to as **senates**, and a realm with a senate is called a **senatorial republic** or just a **republic.**

Senatorial republics have certain advantages over other types of realms, but suffer certain disadvantages as well. Using these rules, adventurers can seek to influence the policies of leading senators, get elected as senators, become rulers of senatorial republics, or even establish senatorial republics of their own. They can, in short, participate in politics and accumulate the power that goes with it. Except where otherwise noted, all rules for domains apply to a senatorial republic.

### Benefits of a Senate

A senatorial republic gains the following advantages over other realms:

* Each domain in the realm gains a permanent +1 bonus to its base morale score. Realms with senates tend to inspire more patriotism and have more stability.
* Non-henchmen assigned to rule vassal domains within the realm have base loyalty scores of 0 instead of -2. A senatorial republic commands loyalty to its senate even if not every member of the government is personally loyal to the current ruler.
* The first extra duty demanded (e.g. build additional stronghold, call to arms, tax demanded, or loan demanded) each month does not trigger a Henchman loyalty check, provided the demand is approved by the Senate. Thus rulers of Republics can demand two duties of their henchman vassals and one duty of their non-henchman vassals, without needing to offer favors or risking a Henchman Loyalty check.
* Levying militia from the realm does not reduce the morale of the realm, provided the levy is approved by the senate. Senatorial republics often pride themselves on their citizen-soldiers.

### Restrictions of a Senate

A senatorial republic has the following restrictions:

* The ruler must consult the senate before invading another realm.
* The ruler must consult the senate before demanding a duty from any vassals.
* The ruler must consult the senate when appointing a new character to manage a vassal domain.
* The ruler must consult the senate before changing the republic’s taxes.
* The ruler must consult the senate before changing the republic’s religion.
* The ruler must consult the senate before levying conscripts or militia from the republic.

Particular senatorial republics may have different restrictions, but these are typical of all. See **Consulting the Senate**, below, for the applicable rules.

If a ruler does not consult the senate when required to do so, or enacts a policy that the senate voted against, then the realm is in **dispute** and temporarily loses all of the benefits of being a senatorial republic. See **Disputes with the Senate**, below.

### Establishing a Senatorial republic

A senatorial republic can be established in one of two ways.

* The ruler of an existing realm can establish a senate to advise him. In this case, the ruler will continue to rule his realm, subject to the restrictions imposed by the new senate.
* Several independent rulers can merge their realms together into one larger realm, establishing a senate as the new realm’s governing body. In this case, the first action of the new senate will be to appoint a character as the new senatorial republic’s ruler. The new ruler will manage the realm subject to the restrictions of the senate. Realms where the ruler is chosen by the senate are often referred to as **republics** and their rulers bear titles such as consul, prime minister, or doge.

Rules for construction of senates are provided below.

###### Constructing A Senate

The following guidelines are offered to help players and Judges establish senatorial republics.

1. Determine the **size of the senate**. This could range from as few as a dozen to over 2,000 senatorial seats. Larger realms typically have larger senates.
2. Determine the **requirements of office**. Requirements might be a minimum level of experience, a title, a wealth threshold, or a property holding. Write down a few sentences about how senators are selected and what powers they hold.
3. Determine the number of **leading senators** in the senate. (Leading senators are named NPCs with whom the adventurers interact. Other senators are called **minor senators**.) For each leading senator, the Judge should generate the following characteristics: alignment; class; level; Intellect, Will, and Charisma; and proficiencies.
4. Assign each leading senator 1d3 **policy objectives** which he aims to achieve while in office. A list of random policy objectives is provided below.
5. Assign each leading senator an **influence value**, which is the number of votes that the senator controls. If the number of votes controlled by all leading senators is less than the number of senatorial seats, the remaining votes are held by **independent minor senators**. If the number of votes controlled is greater than the number of senatorial seats, reduce the number of leading senators, starting with the least influential.
6. Group leading senators with compatible policy objectives together to create **political factions**. Historically, a common configuration has been two opposed factions, such as the Optimates and Populares in the Roman Republic and the Blues and Greens in the Byzantine Empire. Judges who prefer more complexity can, of course, have additional factions. Write down a few sentences about the platform of each faction.
7. Total up to the influence of the leading senators in each faction. If one faction has a majority of influence, it is the **ruling faction**. Otherwise, the faction with the most influence is the **leading faction**.

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Realm Population | Minimum Size | Maximum Size |
| Less than 4,600 | 4 seats | 15 seats |
| 4,600 – 52,000 | 4 seats | 50 seats |
| 53,000 – 363,000 | 16 seats | 225 seats |
| 364,000 – 1,499,000 | 51 seats | 1,500 seats |
| 1,500,001 or more | 225 seats | 6,000 seats |

**Size of the Senate:** The size of a senate is measured in **senatorial seats**. A senate must be large enough to attend to the business of the realm, but not so large that it becomes dysfunctional. The Size of the Senate table, to the right, shows the minimum and maximum size based on the number of families populating the realm.

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Senatorial Seats | Minimum Senator Level | Leading Senators | Influence per Senator |
| 4 – 15 | Ruler’s Level -1 | 1d4 | 2d3 votes |
| 16 –50 | Ruler’s Level -3 | 2d6 | 2d6 votes |
| 51 – 225 | Ruler’s Level -5 | 2d6+3 | 2d6x3 votes |
| 226 – 1,500 | Ruler’s Level -7 | 3d6+2 | 2d10x5 votes |
| 1,501 or more | Ruler’s Level -9 | 4d6+1 | 2d10x20 votes |

The larger a senate, the easier it is to qualify for, and the harder it is for a small number of senators to dominate it. The Senate Characteristics table summarizes these factors.

EXAMPLE: The Auran Empire has a population of 4.3 million families. Its senate must have between 225 and 6,000 seats. The Judge decides it has a senate of 600 seats. The Empire is ruled by a 14th level ruler, so the minimum senator level will be (14-7) 7, and there will be 3d6+2 leading senators. Rolling 3d6+2, the Judge gets a total of 11, so there are 11 leading senators. He rolls 2d8 for the number of votes controlled by each senator, getting 35, 45, 55, 20, 75, 60, 10, 75, 40, 85, and 50 votes, for a total of 550 votes. 50 votes are held by independent minor senators.

**Requirements of Office:** By cross-referencing the level of the realm ruler with the size of the senate, the Judge can determine the minimum level to hold the office of senator. The Judge can use level of experience as the requirement for senator if desired. However, a character’s level of experience is a game mechanic of which the inhabitants of the game world are only indirectly aware; a better option is to impose a requirement such as title, net worth, land owned, or families governed. The Requirements of Office has recommendations for each level, from which the Judge should select a few criteria. The Bribe column is used to determine the cost to bribe a senator (see below).

|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Required Level | Required Title | Required Net Worth | Required Land | Required Families | Bribe (day/week/month/year) |
| 3 | Baron | 5,000gp | 5 1.5m hexes | 40 families | 4gp/25gp/100gp/1,200gp |
| 4 | Baron | 10,000gp | 7 1.5m hexes | 80 families | 7gp/50gp/200gp/2,400gp |
| 5 | Baron | 20,000gp | 12 1.5m hexes | 160 families | 15gp/100gp/400gp/4,800gp |
| 6 | Viscount | 38,000gp | 1 6m hex | 285 families | 25gp/200gp/800gp/9,600gp |
| 7 | Count | 75,000gp | 2 6m hexes | 550 families | 50gp/400gp/1,600gp/19,200gp |
| 8 | Count | 150,000gp | 3 6m hexes | 1,200 families | 100gp/750gp/3,000gp/36,000gp |
| 9 | Duke | 350,000gp | 4 6m hexes | 2,650 families | 250gp/1,800gp/7,250gp/87,000gp |
| 10 | Duke | 500,000gp | 5 6m hexes | 3,750 families | 400gp/3,000gp/12,000gp/144,000gp |
| 11+ | Prince | 1,125,000gp | 10 6m hexes | 8,500 families | 1,000gp/8,000gp/32,000gp/384,000gp |

EXAMPLE: As a 600-seat body under a 14th level ruler, the Auran senate is open to 7th level characters and above. The Judge decides that in the game world, the senate is open to characters who hold the title of Legate (count) or above and manage realms with at least 550 families.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Die Roll | Policy Objective |
| 1 | Establish overland trade routes |
| 2 | Establish maritime trade routes |
| 3 | Increase size of army |
| 4 | Decrease size of army |
| 5 | Increase size of navy |
| 6 | Decrease size of navy |
| 7 | Replace realm ruler with new ruler |
| 8 | Preserve current realm ruler |
| 9 | Conquer neighboring realm |
| 10 | Make peace with neighboring realm |
| 11 | Build strongholds on border with neighboring realm |
| 12 | Decrease taxes on peasants in realm |
| 13 | Increase taxes on peasants in realm |
| 14 | Eliminate slavery in realm (institute, if none) |
| 15 | Re-distribute land from nobility to peasants |
| 16 | Support existing faith of the realm |
| 17 | Introduce new faith to the realm |
| 18 | Increase size of urban settlements in personal realm |
| 19 | Increase territory and population of personal realm |
| 20 | Gain monopolies over merchandise in personal realm |

**Policy Objectives:** The Policy Objectives table can be used to randomly determine goals for the leading senators. Re-roll conflicting results. The Judge should interpret the policy objectives in light of the his campaign.

EXAMPLE: Senator Ulrand Valerian is being assigned 1d3 policy objectives. The Judge rolls for 3 policy goals and gets an 11, 15, and 16. He interprets these goals in light of Valerian’s position as a highly Lawful traditionalist serving as a legate on the borderlands. Valerian has a policy objective of strengthening the border forts along the Krysivor River because he fears the coming beastman invasion. He wants to re-distribute land from the nobility to the peasants in the civilized areas because he believes the Empire can only recover if it returns to its foundation of independent citizen-farmers. He wants to spread the faith of the realm because he believes that the Chthonic gods are subverting the Empire, its laws, and its patriotism.

A senator’s influence and policy objectives are secret until revealed in play.

**Senates Established by Adventurers:** An adventurer who establishes a senate only performs step 1 (determine the size of the senate) and step 2 (determine the requirements for office). He can then appoint qualified senators as desired. Normally these will be the adventurer’s friends, henchman, and vassals, and/or henchman of the same. A ruler who establishes a senate begins with very strong influence over it. For the first 1d6 months after the senate is established, all its senators will vote for the ruler’s policies.

Politics is unpredictable, however, and yesterday’s trusted right-hand man can be tomorrow’s rival. 1d6 months after the adventurer has established his senate, the Judge should randomly determine how many leading senators emerge as influential within the senate. The Judge should then select leading senators from among the NPCs appointed by the adventurer, giving more weight to NPCs that have high INT, WIL, CHA, class level, and relevant proficiencies such as Command, Diplomacy, Leadership, Military Strategy, and Mystic Aura. The Judge should then choose or roll for policy objectives and influence for the senate’s new leaders, and create political factions guided by these results.

###### Consulting the Senate

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Senate Voting** | |
| **Adjusted Die Roll** | **Result** |
| 2- | Votes Against and Condemns Ruler’s Policy |
| 3 – 5 | Votes Against Ruler’s Policy |
| 6 – 8 | Votes With Current Trend |
| 9 – 11 | Vote For Ruler’s Policy |
| 12+ | Votes For and Endorses Ruler’s Policy |

When a ruler seeks the senate’s support for a policy, he must **consult the senate**. When a ruler consults the senate, the Judge should roll 2d6 on the Senate Voting table for each leading senator to see if the senator votes for or against the ruler’s policy. A senator that is **bewitched** will always vote however the character who has bewitched him directs.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Condition** | **Voting Roll Adjustment** |
| Ruler’s current Domain Morale score | + Domain Morale score |
| Ruler does not have Diplomacy | -2 |
| Ruler has Mystic Aura | +1 |
| Ruler is Lawful and has never been implicated in bribery, etc. | +1 |
| Senator is henchman of ruler, or of ruler’s henchman | +5 |
| Senator and ruler are in same political faction | +1 |
| Senator and ruler are in opposed political factions | -2 |
| Other senator from same faction has endorsed ruler | +1 per endorsement |
| Other senator from same faction has condemned ruler | -1 per condemnation |
| Ruler’s proposed policy helps senator’s policy objective | +1 per objective |
| Ruler’s proposed policy hinders senator’s policy objective | -2 per objective |
| Senator has been bribed by ruler | +1/+2/+3 |
| Senator has been bribed by ruler’s rivals | -1/-2/-3 |
| Senator has been intimidated or seduced by ruler | +1 |
| Senator previously but no longer bewitched, intimidated or seduced by ruler | -5 |
| Senator has been intimidated or seduced by ruler’s rivals | -1 |
| Senator previously but no longer bewitched, intim., or seduced by ruler’s rivals | +1 |
| Senator owes ruler for prior favor | +1 per favor |
| One-third or more of realm’s military loyal to ruler | +1 |
| All of realm’s military loyal to ruler | +2 |

A result of “Votes Against and Condemns Petition” means that the senator votes against the petition while giving a rousing condemnation of the petition and the petitioner, which will influence future votes by members of his faction. A result of “Votes Against Petition” means the senator votes against the petition but does not urge others to do so.

A result of “Votes with Current Trend” means the senator votes for the petition if more votes have so far been cast for the petition, and votes against the petition if more votes have so far been cast against the petition. If no votes have been cast for or against yet, the senator abstains.

A result of “Votes For Petition” means the senator votes for the petition but does not urge others to do so. Finally, a result of “Votes For and Endorses Petition” means that the senator votes for the petition and gives an inspiring speech supporting the petition and petitioner which will influence future votes by members of his faction.

Voting is not simultaneous. Instead, voting rolls are conducted in order starting with the most influential senator and continue until a majority of the senators have voted either in favor or against the ruler’s policy. Remember that a leading senator’s vote carries a number of votes equal to the senator’s influence. (These other, less influential senators are assumed to vote “off camera”).

###### Voting Roll Adjustments

To reflect circumstances that may affect the senator’s vote, apply the Voting Roll adjustments shown, based on the ruler, the senator voting, and the policy being discussed.

**Political Factions**: A ruler may choose to align himself with a political faction in the senate. Doing so earns him a +1 bonus to the voting rolls of all senators of the same faction but a -2 penalty to the voting rolls of all senators in opposed factions.

**Bribery:** Rulers may bribe senators prior to a vote in order to ensure a more favorable outcome. Any character can bribe but those with Bribery proficiency are better at it. Proficient characters with Briber proficiency gain a +1 bonus from a day’s income, +2 from a week’s, and +3 from a month’s. Non-proficient characters proficiency gain a +1 bonus from a week’s income, +2 from a month’s, and +3 from a year’s. On an unmodified voting roll result of 2, a bribed senator will reveal that the ruler bribed him. At the Judge’s discretion, a ruler’s rivals may bribe senators to vote against the ruler.

**Intimidation:** Rulers may intimidate senators prior to the vote in order to ensure a more favorable outcome. The character must have the Intimidation proficiency, be in a position to implicitly or explicitly threaten the senator, and grossly outrank or outnumber him. However, if a senator who was previously intimidated by the ruler is able to escape his dominance, a -5 penalty applies instead of a +1 bonus. On an unmodified voting roll result of 2, an intimidated senator will reveal that the ruler intimidated him. At the Judge’s discretion, a ruler’s rivals may intimidate senators to vote against the ruler.

**Seduction:** Petitioners may seduce senators who are potentially attracted to them. The character must have Seduction proficiency and be in a position to entice or allure the senator. However, if a senator was previously seduced by a petitioner and thereafter not well-treated, a -5 penalty applies instead of a +1 bonus. On an unmodified voting roll result of 2, a seduced senator will reveal that the ruler seduced him. At the Judge’s discretion, a ruler’s rivals may seduce senators to vote against the ruler.

**Military Loyalty:** Divisions of troops that are led by the ruler, or by the ruler’s henchmen, count as personally loyal to the ruler. Divisions of troops led by non-henchmen or mercenary commanders do not.

###### Voting Rolls by Faction

If the adventurers have not spent time building relationships with the leading senators, then the Judge can resolve a senate consultation by rolling once for each political faction instead of for each leading senator. Follow the rules above, but only apply voting roll adjustments which are applicable to the ruler and the faction as a whole.

### Disputes with the Senate

If a ruler does not consult the senate when required to do so, or enacts a policy that the senate voted against, then the realm is in **dispute**. A realm in dispute temporarily loses all of the benefits of being a senatorial republic. The benefits are restored if the ruler successfully regains the approval of the senate.

In order to regain the approval of the senate, the ruler must consult the senate with a policy proposal to retroactively approve of his recent action(s). The Judge should roll on the Senate Voting table for each leading senator to see if the senator votes for or against the ruler. If a majority of the senators vote for the ruler, then the dispute ends. If the majority of the senators vote against the ruler, the dispute continues, and any senator who voted against the ruler gains the policy objective “replace realm ruler with new ruler.” The ruler may try to regain the approval of the senate repeatedly if desired but doing so will become harder and harder as more senators become committed to ending his reign.

If the ruler cannot or does not want to regain the approval of the senate, he may simply abandon senatorial government, either formally (dissolving the senate) or informally (ignoring it). In either case, abandoning senatorial government has the following effects:

* The realm permanently loses all of the benefits of being a senatorial republic.
* The ruler’s personal domain must makes its next domain morale roll at a -2 penalty.
* If any of the ruler’s henchmen are senators, they must immediately make loyalty rolls at a -2 penalty.
* If any of the ruler’s vassals are not henchmen, they must immediately make loyalty rolls at a -2 penalty. This penalty is in addition to the base -2 morale of non-vassal henchmen.
* Any influential senators with the policy objective “replace realm with new ruler” will become Hostile, and work against the ruler to the extent possible, using methods such as assassination, ritual magic, war, etc.

Assuming the ruler survives the turmoil that ensues, he may thereafter rule his realm without a senate. He may establish a new senate after 2d6 months, if desired.

### Senatorial Shenanigans

Adventurers with ruffians hired or running a syndicate can order hijinks to gather intelligence on, and influence over, the senate. The following hijinks are particularly useful when dealing with senatorial politics:

* Assassination: Perpetrators can be assigned to assassinate senators.
* Carousing: Perpetrators can be told to seek out political rumors.
* Slandering: Perpetrators can be told to spread lies and rumors.
* Spying: Perpetrators can be assigned to spy on specific senators.

Complete rules on syndicates, perpetrators, and hijinks are explained in **Hideouts and** **Hijinks**, p. XX – XX.

### Gaining Influence

Adventurers who are rulers or senators themselves might seek to gain influence over independent minor senators. An independent minor senator will vote as directed by the adventurer if any of the following applies:

* The minor senator has been **bewitched** by the adventurer.
* The minor senator is a henchman of the adventurer.
* The minor senator has received gifts his month from the adventurer sufficient to provide a +3 bonus on reaction rolls from a bribe.
* The minor senator has Friendly reactions with the adventurer andhas received gifts this month from the adventurer sufficient to provide a +1 bonus to reaction rolls from a bribe.

If two or more characters provide gifts (or bribes) to the same minor senator in the same month, the senator is considered to favor whichever gift-giver offered more. If the value of the gifts is the same, the senator favors whichever gift-giver he has better reactions with currently. If the senator’s reactions are also the same with both gift-givers, the gifts have no effect.

### Politics Is Just War Continued By Other Means

This system is purposefully open to terrible amounts of skullduggery. Adventurers and their opponents can bewitch, bribe, intimidate, and seduce senators; assassinate or kidnap senators so they cannot vote; defame and blackmail their political opponents; and generally do all of the awful and ruthless things that historical politicians have done. It is up to the Judge to determine how much of the campaign should be set aside for “politicking”. Bribery, intimidation, etc. can be extensively role-played or resolved quickly with die rolls, depending on the interests of the Judge and players.
