## Magic

Bladedancers are divine spellcasters who receive their magic from their patron deity. Their magic focuses on protection, combat enhancement, and divine judgment.

**Spell Acquisition:** Bladedancers acquire spells through prayer and meditation. They do not use spell books. All bladedancer spells of the appropriate level are considered to be "known" by the bladedancer and she need not select them individually. Bladedancers cannot cast spells of 1st level until they reach 2nd class level.

**Spell Slots:** A bladedancer's spell-casting ability is summarized on the **Bladedancer Spell Progression** table. That table shows the number of spell slots available at each class level, according to the level of the spell. A 2nd level bladedancer can cast one 1st level spell per day, while a 14th level bladedancer can cast four 1st level spells, four 2nd level spells, four 3rd level spells, four 4th level spells, three 5th level spells, and three 6th level spells per day.

**Spell Casting:** Bladedancers must have their hands free to cast spells. Like other divine spellcasters, bladedancers cannot cast divine spells while wearing armor heavier than light armor. Bladedancers may cast spells from a spell scroll of divine spells, regardless of class, with a proficiency throw of 10+ (adding the spell level to this throw).

**Spell List:** The list of spells available to bladedancers can be found at the end of this chapter.

**Restoring Magic:** Bladedancers regain their ability to cast spells through prayer and meditation. They must spend at least 4 hours in prayer to recover their spell slots.

## Starting Class Powers

At the start of play, bladedancers have the class powers below:

**Bladesong:** A bladedancer can enter a battle trance known as bladesong. While in bladesong, the bladedancer gains a +2 bonus to AC and a +1 bonus to attack throws. However, she cannot cast spells while in bladesong. Entering or leaving bladesong requires a full round. A bladedancer can maintain bladesong for a number of rounds equal to her Constitution bonus plus her class level. She can use bladesong once per day at 1st level, twice per day at 3rd level, and three times per day at 6th level and higher.

**Divine Favor:** Bladedancers serve specific deities and can gain divine favor for their devout service. A bladedancer begins play with 2d6 points of divine favor with her patron deity. Additional rules for divine favor can be found in the **Campaigns** chapter.

**Fighting Withdrawal:** Bladedancers are expert at hit-and-run tactics. A bladedancer that is engaged in melee can use the fighting withdrawal maneuver and still attack normally that round, without any penalty to her attack throw.

**Precise Shooting:** Bladedancers are very accurate with missiles due to their excellent hand-eye coordination. Bladedancers do not suffer the -4 penalty to hit when making a precise shot (attacking a specific body part or small target).

**Turn Undead:** Bladedancers can channel the power of their deity to drive away or destroy undead creatures. This ability functions as a crusader's turn undead ability, but uses the bladedancer's class level. See the **Crusader** class description for complete rules on turning undead.

## Additional Class Powers

When they advance in level, bladedancers gain the following additional class powers:

**Weapons of Sharpness (5th level):** All melee weapons wielded by the bladedancer are treated as weapons of sharpness +1. This magical enhancement applies only while the weapon is in the bladedancer's hands.

**Lay on Hands (7th level):** The bladedancer can heal herself or others by laying on hands. This ability can heal 2 points of damage per bladedancer level, once per day. The bladedancer can also cure diseases with this ability, but doing so uses up the healing for that day.

**Temple (9th level):** By acquiring a **temple** worth at least 25,000gp, the bladedancer can attract followers to serve her. 2d6 1st level bladedancers and 1d6 1st level crusaders will arrive to serve her within 1d6 weeks of her acquiring the temple. If the bladedancer already has a temple, the followers arrive within 1d6 weeks of her reaching 9th level. If hired, the followers must be paid standard rates for henchmen. These followers will serve the character with absolute loyalty. A wise bladedancer can use her temple to spread her faith, provide aid to the community, and build a power base. Additional rules for temples are detailed in the **Campaigns** chapter.

## Class Proficiencies

**Proficiency Progression:** At 1st level, bladedancers select one class proficiency from their class proficiency list and one general proficiency from the general proficiency list. They select an additional class proficiency at 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th level. They select an additional general proficiency at 5th, 9th, and 13th level.

**Bladedancer Proficiency List:** Acrobatics, Alertness, Art (dance), Armor Training, Ceremonial Magic, Combat Reflexes, Combat Trickery (disarm, knock down), Dancing, Diplomacy, Fighting Style Specialization, Healing, Intimidation, Language, Leadership, Lore, Performance, Precise Shooting, Prophecy, Riding, Skirmishing, Theology, Weapon Finesse, Weapon Focus
