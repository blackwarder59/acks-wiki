**Type** determines which weapon proficiencies and fighting styles are required to use the weapon. Note that small melee weapons are those wielded with just one hand, medium melee weapons are those wielded with either one or two hands, and large melee weapons are those requiring two hands to wield. Missile weapons are wielded with two hands unless Handy or Thrown (q.v.). **Damage** is the number of hit points a target loses when successfully attacked by the weapon. Damage can be modified by attributes, class powers, magic, and proficiencies.

**Encumbrance** is the weight of the weapon. 1 stone is approximately 10 – 15 lbs. Most small and medium weapons weigh 1/6 stone while most large weapons weigh 1 stone. **Short/Medium/Long** indicates the distance (in feet) that the weapon can be fired at short, medium, and long range. Attacks at medium range suffer a -2 penalty while attacks at long range suffer a -5 penalty. **Cost** is the price of a clean, well-made weapon in an urban settlement. Rusty, shoddy weapons can sometimes be purchased for less, but have worse characteristics (Judge’s discretion). **Special** calls out any peculiar features of the weapon. The special features include:

* *Cleave:* The weapon is limited in the number of cleaves it can perform in a round. The limit is listed after the Cleave tag.
* *Entangling:* The weapon grants a +2 bonus to attack throws when used to make a knockdown or wrestling special maneuver.
* *Flexible:* The weapon grants a +2 bonus to attack throws when used to make a disarm or knockdown special maneuver.
* *Handy:* The missile weapon only requires one hand, enabling it to be used with a shield. If a missile weapon is both slow and handy, it can only be used with a shield while the combatant is dismounted and stationary.
* *Impact:* The weapon deals an additional die of impact damage when used in or against a charge. Impact damage is of the same type as the weapon ordinarily delivers.
* *Incapacitating:* The weapon grants a +2 bonus to attack throws when used to make an incapacitation special maneuver.
* *Long:* The weapon can be used to attack targets from the second rank that are **engaged** with an ally in the front rank. However, any attack throw of a natural 1 made with the weapon breaks its shaft. It costs 1gp to repair the break. Until repaired, the weapon can be used as an off-balance (-1 to attacks throw) dagger and/or staff.
* *Mounted:* The weapon only requires one hand if the character is mounted.
* *Silver:* The weapon’s blade has been coated in silver. Silver versions of other common weapons can be found or commissioned for 10x the listed price of the weapon. Apart from gaining the Silver feature, the weapon’s characteristics do not change.
* *Slow:* The weapon cannot be fired on consecutive combat rounds unless the character remains stationary or is mounted.
* *Thrown:* The weapon can be thrown as a missile.

**Type** determines which armor proficiencies or fighting styles are required. **AC** indicates the armor class granted. **Encumbrance** is the weight of the armor. **Cost** is the price of a clean, well-made item in an urban settlement. Rusty, shoddy armor can sometimes be purchased for less, but have worse characteristics (Judge’s discretion). **Special** calls out any peculiar features of the armor, including:

* *Enclosing:* Wearing the item imposes a -1 penalty to surprise rolls and -4 penalty to proficiency throws to hear noise, but grants a +2 bonus on d20 rolls made on the Mortal Wounds table.
* *Revealing:* Characters with clean-limbed bodies (STR, DEX, CON, and CHA all 11+) gain a +1 bonus to Seduction reaction rolls when wearing the armor. Why they do not gain this bonus while naked or in revealing clothes of an ordinary sort is still being researched by the sages of the Tower of Knowledge.
* *Scarce:* Scarce armors are generally available at only one-half the usual volume noted in the Equipment Availability by Market Class table. However, scarce armor is available at full volume at markets in dwarven settlements.
* *Spiked:* Barding with spikes adds +1 damage per die to the animal’s bite, claw, hoof, tail, tusk, or trample attacks.

At the Judge’s’ discretion, certain markets might sell monster venoms and plant toxins, so gp costs are listed here. More rules on poisons are included in the ***ACKS II Judge’s Journal****.*

**AC** is the armor class of the weapon itself. **SHP** is the structural hit points of the weapon. **Weight** is the weight of the weapon. For trebuchets, the weight includes the counterweight (ballast). **Ammo Weight** is the weight of the ammunition fired by the weapon. Artillery is most effective when firing ammunition of the designated weight. Artillery can fire ammunition of a lighter or heavier weight than indicated for their type, but reduce maximum range by 25%. Artillery firing crude shot suffers a -2 penalty to attack throws. **Range** shows the minimum and maximum range of the weapon. **Damage** indicates the damage dealt by the artillery to creatures within its area of effect. **Structure Damage** is a multiplier applied to the base damage of the artillery vs. wooden and stone structures. **Crew** and **Rate of Fire** show the variable crew that can be used with the consequent rate of fire. Artillery crews without an artillerist specialist reduce their rate of fire by half and attack at -4. See Missile Attacks with Artillery (p. XX).
