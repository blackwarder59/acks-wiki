## Combat Characteristics

Combat characteristics determine how effective a class is in battle. There are two distinct combat characteristics, **Combat Proficiencies** and **Combat Progression**.

### Combat Proficiencies

Each class has a set of combat proficiencies that determine which weapons it can fight with, in what manner, while wearing which armor.

###### Armor

A class can be proficient in all, heavy, medium, light, or very light armor. Some classes are not proficient in any armor at all. Note that very light armor weighs 1 stone or less; light armor weighs 2 stone; medium armor weighs 3 – 4 stone; and heavy armor weighs 5 stone or more. (Some masterwork or magical armor might actually be less encumbering, but that doesn’t change its type for purposes of armor proficiency.) The **Equipment** chapter on p. XX lists the available types of armor.

###### Weapons

A class can be proficient in all weapons. Most classes, however, are limited in their proficiency with weapons to specific categories, types, and sizes of weapons.

* A class can be proficient in all missile weapons; all tiny, small, and medium melee weapons; and/or all large melee weapons.
* A class can be proficient in all types of axes, all types of bludgeons, all types of bows and crossbows, all types of spears and polearms, and/or all types of swords and daggers.
* A class can be proficient in a list of specific weapons, often those which are traditional to its class or race.

For melee weapons capable of being thrown (such as daggers, hand axes, or spears), weapon proficiency includes the ability to use it as a missile weapon. Note that tiny and small weapons are wielded with just one hand, medium weapons can be wielded with either one or two hands, and large weapons can only be wielded with two hands. The **Equipment** chapter lists the available weapons and their characteristics and costs.

Regardless of class, all characters are considered proficient when throwing bottles, flasks, rocks, sticks, and torches.

###### Fighting Styles

There are five styles of fighting.

* *Missile Weapon:* Fighting while wielding a missile weapon in one, both, or each hand (depending on the weapon).
* *Single Weapon:* Fighting while wielding a single tiny, small, or medium melee weapon.
* *Dual Weapon:* Fighting while wielding a tiny, small, or medium melee weapon in each hand.
* *Two-Handed Weapon:* Fighting while wielding a medium or large melee weapon in both hands.
* *Weapon and Shield:* Fighting while wielding a small, tiny, or medium weapon or missile weapon in one hand and a shield in the other. Classes which lack this style do not gain any benefit from shields.

All classes are proficient in the single weapon and missile weapon styles, which are mandatory when creating a class using the ***ACKS***class building rules. The other three fighting styles are optional. Some classes have proficiency in one or more, and some do not, as noted in their class entries. Note that fighting style proficiency is distinct from weapon proficiency and both are required to avoid the non-proficiency penalty. For instance, the thief class is proficient in the two-handed weapon style, but does not have proficiency in any large melee weapons. Therefore a thief would be proficient fighting two-handed with a sword (a medium weapon) but not with a great axe (a large weapon).

###### Non-Proficient Use of Weapons and Armor

Nothing stops a panicked thief from picking up a great axe in a moment of desperation and swinging it at his foe. Regardless of class limitations, characters of any class can purchase, carry, and use any weapons or armor desired. However, characters of 1st level or higher who equip themselves with weapons and armor unusable by their class attack as 0th level fighters while so equipped. 0th level characters such as mercenaries or militia equipped with weapons and armor with which they are not proficient still fight as 0th level characters, but suffer an additional -1 penalty. Regardless of level, the characters will receive no bonus on their attack throws or armor class from attributes, cannot use any of their class powers, and do not gain XP from adventures in which they were so equipped.

### Combat Progression

As classes advance in level, they become better at fighting and surviving the perils of adventure. A class’s combat progression determines the rate at which its **attack throws** and **saving throws** progress. Fighters improve the most rapidly, while mages improve the least rapidly, with other classes falling in between.

In addition to gaining better attack throws and saving throws, some classes gain **damage bonuses** by level, either with all or some weapons. In addition, some classes gain the ability to **cleave** after killing a foe. The mechanics of cleaving are explained in the **Adventures** chapter (p. XX).
