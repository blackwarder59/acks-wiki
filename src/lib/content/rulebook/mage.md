# Mage

Key Attribute: INT

Requirements: None

Hit Dice: 1d4

Maximum Level: 14

Sometimes called wizards, sorcerers, or magicians, mages study arcane secrets and cast spells. While early in their career mages have only limited power, experienced mages are able to cast a great number of powerful spells. In the Auran Empire, a mage might be a wizard steeped in the lore of the Tower of Knowledge, a sinister sorcerer of Kemesh or the Sunset Kingdoms, or a hedge wizard with strange charms and hodge-podge traditions.

## Combat Characteristics

Because of their devotion to arcane study, mages receive limited combat training. They are quite vulnerable to physical danger, and in an adventuring group they should be protected.

**Combat Proficiencies:** Mages have weapon proficiency with clubs, daggers, darts, and staffs. They have no armor proficiency. They have fighting style proficiency with the two-handed weapon style (allowing them to use a staff with both hands), but not with the dual weapon or weaponand shield styles.

**Combat Progression:** Mages advance in attack throws and saving throws by only two points every six levels of experience (i.e., half as fast as fighters). They do not gain any bonus to damage as they advance in level. They cannot cleave, regardless of their level.

## Starting Class Powers

At the start of play, mages have the following class powers.

**Arcane Magic:** Mages can learn and cast powerful arcane spells. The number and levels of spells the mage can cast in a single day are listed on the Mage Spell Progression table. A mage's spell selection is limited to the spells in his **repertoire**. A mage's repertoire can include a number of spells up to the number and level of spells listed for his level, increased by his Intellect bonus. For instance, Quintus, a 3rd level mage, is able to cast 2 1st level spells and 1 2nd level spell per day. If he has 16 INT (+2 modifier) he can have up to 4 1st level and 3 2nd level spells in his repertoire (though the number of spells he can cast each day is unaffected). More information on casting spells and individual spell descriptions can be found in the **Spells** chapter.

**Collegiate Wizardry**: The mage has received arcane instruction as an apprentice to a mage, pupil at a magical academy, or member of an arcane organization. He can begin play as a member of a wizard's guild or similar order (Judge's discretion). He can automatically identify arcane symbols, spell signatures, trappings, and grimoires of his own order or tradition, and can recognize those of other orders or traditions with a proficiency throw of 11+. Rare or esoteric traditions might be harder to recognize. (This class power is the equivalent of one rank of Collegiate Wizardry proficiency).

## Additional Class Powers

When they advance in level, mages gain the following additional class powers:

**Minor Magical Research (5th level):** The mage can research spells, scribe magical scrolls, and brew potions. Rules for magic research can be found in the **Campaigns** chapter (p. XX).

**Major Magical Research (9th level):** The mage can create more powerful magic items such as weapons, rings, and staffs.

**Sanctum (9th level):** By acquiring a **sanctum** (often a great tower) worth at least 15,000gp, the mage can attract followers to his service. 1d6 apprentices of 1st – 3rd level plus 2d6 apprentices of 0th level arrive to serve him as followers within 1d3 months of him acquiring the sanctum. If the mage already has a sanctum, the followers arrive to serve him within 1d3 months of him reaching 9th level. The apprentices function as assistants in magical research (see p. XXX). If performing magic research, the apprentices must be provided food and lodging, but need not be paid wages. (If asked to accompany the mage on an adventure, the apprentices must be paid wages as henchmen.) If the mage builds a **dungeon** beneath or near his sanctum, monsters will start to arrive to dwell within, often followed by adventurers seeking to fight them. Additional rules for mages' **sanctums** are detailed in the **Campaigns** chapter (p. XX).

**Supreme Magical Research (11th level):** The mage can learn and cast ritual arcane spells of great power (7th, 8th, and 9th level), craft magical constructs, and create magical crossbreeds. If chaotic, the mage can create necromantic servants and become undead.

## Class Proficiencies

**Proficiency Progression:** At 1st level, mages select one class proficiency from their class proficiency list and one general proficiency from the general proficiency list. They select an additional class proficiency at 6th and 12th level. They select an additional general proficiency at 5th, 9th, and 13th level.

**Notes:** Most characters of this class have above average Intellect, and the templates above reflect that. Each template assumes that the character has an INT attribute of between 13 and 15, qualifying him for one bonus proficiency and one bonus spell. The bonus proficiency and bonus spell that each template begins with are noted last. For characters with INT of less than 13 or greater than 15, see the **Intellect Scores of Studious Spellcasters** section earlier in this Chapter.

The Elementalist can choose to replace the fire spells with one of three alternative spell selections available, one for each element:

Air: *thunderclap*,*weave**smoke*

Earth: *earth's**excrescence*, *sling**stone*

Water: *desiccate*, *slickness*
