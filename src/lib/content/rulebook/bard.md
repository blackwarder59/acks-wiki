Bards are arcane spellcasters who combine song, magic, and swordplay. They are wandering musicians, court entertainers, and traveling storytellers. Bards trace their traditions back to elven loremasters and human court musicians. Most bards begin as members of a bardic college, and can return to that college for training and knowledge over the course of their careers. The most famed bardic college in the known world is the Imperial Conservatory in Aura.

## Combat Characteristics

Bards are lightly armored skirmishers who rely more on speed and cunning than might and steel. The demands of spellcasting require that bards have exceptional manual dexterity. This same dexterity serves them well when wielding a blade or bow.

**Combat Proficiencies:** Bards have weapon proficiency with arbalests, bows, crossbows, daggers, darts, short swords, slings, spears, staves, and swords. They have armor proficiency with light armor. They have fighting style proficiency with dual weapon fighting only.

**Combat Progression:** Bards advance in attack throws and saving throws as thieves, by one point every two levels of experience. Bards increase their base damage roll from successful missile and melee attacks by +1 at 1st level and by an additional +1 at 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th level.

## Magic

Bards are arcane spellcasters. Like mages, bards study formulaic magic. However, the magic they employ is interwoven with music, oration, and performance. For bards, spellcasting is more of an art than a science.

**Spell Acquisition:** Bards acquire spells at the same rate and in the same way as mages. Each spell must be learned, either from spell books or from other arcane spellcasters willing to teach the bard. A bard's spell book is called a **songbook**. A bard must have his songbook in hand in order to memorize spells, but the songbook is not required for casting. No spells are acquired automatically on level gain.

**Spell Slots:** A bard's spell-casting ability is summarized on the **Bard Spell Progression** table. That table shows the number of spell slots available at each class level, according to the level of the spell. A 1st level bard can cast one 1st level spell per day, while a 14th level bard can cast four 1st level spells, four 2nd level spells, four 3rd level spells, four 4th level spells, three 5th level spells, and three 6th level spells per day.

**Spell Casting:** Bards must have their hands free to cast spells. Like mages, bards cannot cast arcane spells while wearing any armor heavier than light armor or while using a shield. Bards may cast spells from a spell scroll of arcane spells, regardless of class, with a proficiency throw of 10+ (adding the spell level to this throw).

**Spell List:** At first level, a bard knows read magic and one other 1st level spell from the bard spell list. The list of spells available to bards can be found at the end of this chapter.

**Repertoire:** Bards do not memorize specific spells. Instead, they have a **repertoire** of spells they can readily perform. A bard may change his repertoire when he gains a level. The number of spells in a bard's repertoire is equal to his spell slots plus his Intelligence bonus. A bard may have no more than two spells of each spell level in his repertoire.

**Restoring Magic:** Bards recover their ability to cast spells by spending at least 4 hours in restful contemplation of their repertoire.

## Starting Class Powers

At the start of play, bards have the class powers below:

**Divine Favor:** A bard might begin play as a member of a bardic college (Judge's discretion). A bard who is a college member gains divine favor like a crusader, but for his bardic college instead of a god. If the bard falls out of favor with his college, he will lose access to the divine favor. Bardic colleges are detailed in the **Campaigns** chapter.

**Inspire:** A bard can use music and oration to inspire emotions. Using this power requires a full round during which the bard cannot move, attack, or cast spells. When used during combat, all allies within 30' of the bard gain a +1 bonus to attack throws, damage rolls, morale rolls (for hirelings and other NPCs), and saving throws versus fear for the duration of the encounter. When used outside of combat, inspire can improve the reaction of NPCs if used before an encounter reaction roll. The Judge should assess a bonus to the roll based on the situation and the bard's performance. This power can be used a number of times per day equal to the bard's class level.

**Languages:** A bard can speak a number of additional languages equal to his Intelligence bonus. These may be regional human languages, demihuman languages, or even monster languages (such as orcish or draconic).

**Lore:** As professional tale-tellers and minstrels, bards are exposed to countless stories during their careers. Often these tales contain useful bits of information about legendary places, famous people, noteworthy items, and the like. At 1st level, bards have one rank of the general proficiency Lore. With a successful Lore proficiency throw, a bard can recall legends or songs pertaining to a particular item, place, or person. Such legends or songs are often partially symbolic or allegorical, requiring interpretation to be useful. A result that exceeds the target value by 10 or more yields information that is quite detailed and specific. A bard can use Lore a number of times per day equal to 1 plus his Intelligence bonus.

**Magical Music:** Bards learn to weave arcane energy into their music, allowing them to work magic without formal spells. At 1st level, a bard can charm person and ventriloquism each once per day. These magical music abilities are cast as if by a caster of the bard's class level. The bard gains additional magical music abilities as he gains levels, as detailed under Additional Class Powers.

**Precise Shooting:** Bards are very accurate with missiles due to their excellent hand-eye coordination. Bards do not suffer the -4 penalty to hit when making a precise shot (attacking a specific body part or small target).

**Skirmishing:** Bards are lightly armed and armored, depending on mobility for protection. A bard engaged in melee can use the skirmishing maneuver to retreat 5' at the end of the round.

## Additional Class Powers

When they advance in level, bards gain the following additional class powers:

**Magical Music Abilities:** Bards learn additional magical music abilities as they gain levels:

- **3rd level:** hypnotism and invisibility, each once per day
- **5th level:** dispel magic and suggestion, each once per day
- **7th level:** confusion and freedom of movement, each once per day
- **9th level:** command, each three times per day
- **11th level:** mass charm and seeming, each once per day

All magical music abilities are cast as if by a caster of the bard's class level.

**College (9th level):** By acquiring a **college** worth at least 15,000gp, a bard can attract students and followers to study under him. 2d4 1st level bards and 1d4 1st level entertainers will seek him out to serve as students. If the bard already has a college, the students seek him out within 1d6 weeks of him reaching 9th level. If hired, students must be paid standard rates for henchmen. These followers will serve the character with some loyalty. A clever bard can use his college to gain access to lore, collect and disseminate information, and even establish a spy network. Additional rules for bardic colleges are detailed in the **Campaigns** chapter.

## Class Proficiencies

**Proficiency Progression:** At 1st level, bards select one class proficiency from their class proficiency list and one general proficiency from the general proficiency list. They select an additional class proficiency at 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th level. They select an additional general proficiency at 5th, 9th, and 13th level.

**Bard Proficiency List:** Alertness, Arcane Dabbling, Art (any), Bargaining, Cat Burglary, Climbing, Combat Reflexes, Diplomacy, Disguise, Eavesdropping, Elven Bloodline, Gambling, Healing, Language, Leadership, Lip Reading, Lore, Mapping, Mimicry, Performance, Prophecy, Riding, Seduction, Storytelling, Theology

## Bard Spell List

Bards have access to a special list of spells that combine arcane and divine magic principles. The complete list of bard spells will be provided in the Spells chapter.
