## Spell Reversal

Some spells, marked with an asterisk (\*) on the spell lists, can be cast **reversed.** A reversed spell results in an effect that is opposite to the effect the spell normally causes. For example, when a mage casts *petrification*, he can turn a flesh-and-blood creature into stone. But when a mage casts the reverse spell, *depetrification*, he can restore a creature that has been petrified back to life. Where it is not self-evident, the spell descriptions below will explain what reversed spells do. If a spell name is not marked with an asterisk, the spell is not reversible.

Studious spellcasters must treat the normal and reversed version of a spell as separate spells for purposes of their repertoire. Prayerful spellcasters know both the normal and reversed form of any spell on their spell list. However, Lawful divine spellcasters prefer to cast spells in their normal form, e.g. favoring *remove fear*over *cause fear*and *cure light injury*over *cause light injury*, and will use the reversed forms only against Chaotic opponents**.** Conversely, Chaotic divine spellcasters will freely cast reversed spells such as *cause fear*, while using the normal version only to aid comrades and followers. Some divine spellcasters might be restricted entirely by their deity from using normal or reversed versions of particular spells (Judgeâ€™s discretion).
