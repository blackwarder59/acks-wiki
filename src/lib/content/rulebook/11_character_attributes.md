## Character Attributes

Character attributes are determined by rolling randomly. Pick one attribute and roll 5d6; drop the lowest 2 dice and tally the rest. If less than 13, increase to 13. Pick a second and third attribute and roll 4d6 for each; drop the lowest die and tally the rest. If less than 9, increase to 9. Roll 3d6 for each of the remaining three attributes.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Attribute Modifiers** | |
| **Attribute** | **Bonus/Penalty** |
| 3 | -3 |
| 4 – 5 | -2 |
| 6 – 8 | -1 |
| 9 – 12 | 0 |
| 13 – 15 | +1 |
| 16 – 17 | +2 |
| 18 | +3 |

When complete, your character will have a score ranging from 3 to 18 in each of the following abilities. A bonus or penalty is associated with each score, as shown on the table below. Add up those bonuses and penalties; if the sum is less than 0, you can discard the character and re-roll.

**Strength (STR):** As the name implies, this attribute measures the character’s raw physical power. Strength is a key attribute for assassins, barbarians, dwarven vaultguards, elven spellswords, and fighters. Apply the attribute bonus or penalty for Strength to all attack throws and damage rolls in melee combat as well as to damage rolls with thrown weapons (excluding certain splash weapons such as burning oil). Note that a penalty here will not reduce damage from a successful attack below one point, unless the target is otherwise invulnerable to the attack (see the **Adventures** chapter for details). Strength also aids in opening doors, smashing crates, and so on; apply 4x the bonus or penalty to all Dungeonbashing throws, i.e. ±4/8/12.

**Intellect (INT):** This attribute measures learning ability and critical thinking. Intellect is a key attribute for elven nightblades, elven spellswords, mages, Nobiran wonderworkers, and Zaharan ruinguards. The attribute bonus for Intellect is added to the number of general proficiencies the character begins play with (see the **Proficiencies** chapter for details) and the number of languages the character is able to learn to read and write (described below). Studious spellcasters increase the number of spells of each level in their repertoire by their Intellect bonus (see the **Spells** chapter for details).

**Will (WIL):** This attribute measures mental fortitude, whether due to inherent wisdom or faith in a higher power. Will is a key attribute for bladedancers, crusaders, dwarven craftpriests, Nobiran wonderworkers, priestesses, and shamans, who must have the self-discipline to uphold their clerical codes of behavior. The Will bonus or penalty applies to all saving throws.

**Dexterity (DEX):** This attribute measures the character’s agility and reflexes. Dexterity is a key attribute for assassins, bards, bladedancers, elven nightblades, and thieves. A character’s Dexterity bonus or penalty is applied to his attack throws with missile weapons, armor class value, and initiative die rolls.

**Constitution (CON):** Constitution is a combination of general health and vitality. Constitution is a key attribute for barbarians and explorers. Apply the Constitution bonus or penalty to each Hit Die rolled by the character to determine hit points. Note that a penalty here cannot reduce any Hit Die roll to less than 1 point.

**Charisma (CHA):** This attribute measures how well a character can influence or even lead people; those with high Charisma are well-liked, or at least highly respected. Charisma is a key attribute for bards, priestesses, and venturers. Apply the Charisma bonus or penalty to the character’s reaction rolls. Charisma also determines the maximum number of henchmen the character can employ, and modifies their morale and loyalty. The number of henchmen a character can hire is equal to 4 plus the Charisma bonus or penalty (and therefore ranges from 1 to 7); the average morale of any such henchmen will vary with their equipment and experience; the average loyalty of any such henchmen will be 0, modified by the character’s Charisma bonus or penalty.

### Classes and Attributes

Once abilities have been determined, each player must choose a class. Classes are a gestalt of background, profession, and race, which dictates what sorts of training and capabilities characters can develop. All player characters begin at 1st level in a particular class. Normal people, lacking the call to adventure, are generally 0th level characters.

Each class has one or more **key attributes**. A character must have an attribute of at least 9 in a class’s key attribute(s) in order to choose a particular class. Some classes have additional minimum attribute requirements. If so, a character must meet the minimum attribute requirements in order to choose a particular class.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Key Attribute** | |
| **Score** | **Experience Adjustment** |
| 9 – 12 | 0 |
| 13 – 15 | +5% |
| 16 – 18 | +10% |

If a character’s key attribute is high enough, the character will receive a bonus to experience points earned during play. The Key Attribute table details the effect a score in a key attribute has on experience points earned by characters. If a class has two key attributes, calculate the character’s experience adjustment based on whichever key attribute is lower.
