Equipment is purchased using money. Paper currency is non-existent in the world of the Auran Empire*,* so money takes the form of coins of precious metal. The copper piece is the most widely-used coin. A copper piece (cp) purchases a loaf of bread or three pints of cheap ale. 10cp make a silver piece (sp). 10sp or 100cp make a gold piece (gp). These three coins are the most widely used in the civilized world. Less commonly seen are electrum pieces (ep), each worth 5sp, and platinum pieces (pp), each worth 5gp.

###### What’s a Gold Piece Worth?

To put the value of currency in perspective, the Standard of Living table, below, shows how far a gold piece will go towards cost of living at different standards of comfort. A single gold piece is enough for a peasant to subsist at a wretched quality of life. Early in their career, adventurers will typically live on a few dozen gold pieces per month, enough to eat and sleep at an inn. A dragon’s treasure hoard of 50,000gp might keep a village of peasants alive for decade, but merely cover a prince’s monthly budget. Wealth is assumed to be highly concentrated in ***ACKS***campaign worlds.
