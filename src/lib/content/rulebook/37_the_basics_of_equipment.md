## The Basics of Equipment

Adventurers need weapons, armor, equipment, mounts, vehicles, or hirelings. If your campaign is using templates, each adventurer will already have his starting assets. If not, the player should roll 3d6 x 10 to determine his adventurer’s starting gold pieces.

Each character should purchase equipment suitable for their class. For example, fighters should purchase arms and armor to fight monsters and survive blows, while thieves need rope, crowbars, thieves’ tools, and other equipment to scale obstacles, find traps, and open locks. Crusaders will require holy symbols to drive back undead and mages will need spellbooks to record their dweomers.
