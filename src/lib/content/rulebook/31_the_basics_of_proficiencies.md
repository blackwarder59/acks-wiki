## The Basics of Proficiencies

Proficiencies represent particular areas of expertise that your character has developed due to his background, homeland, and training. Each class has a **class** **list** of proficiencies, representing training that is particularly useful to the particular profession. In addition, there is a **general list** of proficiencies, which represent trade skills and knowledge that is widely available to all. Characters will learn proficiencies from both lists over time.
