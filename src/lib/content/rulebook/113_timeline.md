**Note:** The centuries and years in this adventure are denoted either BE (Before Empire) or IY (Imperial Year), which respectively descend to and ascend from the founding of the Auran Empire. You can correlate these to the Western calendar’s BC and AD dating system. For instance, 2500 BE is approximately similar to the time in our own world when the great pyramid was completed and Assyria was founded.
