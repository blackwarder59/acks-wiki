**Magic research projects** include researching spells, scribing scrolls, brewing potions, crafting charged and permanent magic items, crossbreeding monsters, creating necromantic servants, designing and building constructs, and learning and casting ritual spells. The exact type of research projects a character can undertake is determined by his class, level, and proficiencies.

Every research project has a **component cost**, a **material cost**, anda **research cost**, each measuredin gold pieces. In most cases the three costs are equal, such that a project’s material cost equals its component cost equals its research cost. This shared value is often called the research’s **base cost**. The material cost, research cost, component cost, and any other requirements are determined by the type of magic research and the power of magic involved.

EXAMPLE: A For example, a **scroll of slumber** has a base cost of 500gp. Its material, component, and research cost are each 500gp. A while a **sword +1** has a base cost of 5,000gp. Its material, component, and research costs are each 5,000gp.

The component cost is paid in kind with special components. Usually these are monster parts containing magical power. The component cost represents the means by which magical energy is affixed to the project. The exact nature of the components required will vary by project. The component cost of a **sword +1**might be paid with the iron slag of an iron golem worth 5,000gp. The component cost is paid at the end of the project.

The material cost is paid by coin or in kind with precious materials. Rare woods, noble metals, such as silver, gold, and platinum, and precious gems, such as rubies and diamonds, retain magic better than common woods, crude metals, or simple stone. Likewise, masterful craftsmanship that achieves the golden ratios of balance and symmetry is more useful for magic than clumsy or shoddy work. The exact nature of the material cost will vary by project. The material cost of a **sword +1** might include the cost of a masterwork blade, a jeweled pommel, a gilded tip, and so on, all costing a total of 5,000gp. The material cost is paid at the beginning of the project.

The research cost is “paid” by the labor of a **magic researcher** and possibly one or more **research assistants**. The research rate is paid over the course of the project. Each day, each participating character contributes a gp value of research towards the research cost. This amount is known as the **research rate**. A character’s research rate is determined by his caster level, as shown on the adjoining table. The sum of the research rates of all the participating characters on the project is the **total research rate**.

Undertaking magic research counts as a strenuous dedicated activity each day. A researcher can undertake magic research as an ancillary activity but only applies 1/8 his research rate. A researcher can undertake magic research as both dedicated and ancillary activities, but doing so counts as overtime and causes the researcher to become **fatigued**.

EXAMPLE: Elaria is a 9th level elven wizard with a research rate of 600gp per day. She is assisted by her henchman Irial, an elven courtier with a research rate of 25gp per day. The pair are scribing a scrollwith a research cost of 2,500gp. Each day, Elaria and Irial contribute 625gp towards the research cost. After four days of research, they have contributed 625 x 4 = 2,500gp so they have completed the project.

If Elaria had worked alone, her research rate would have been 600gp per day. After four days, she would have contributed 2,400gp towards the research cost, leaving (2,500gp – 2,400gp) 100 gp in research cost unpaid. On the fifth day, she uses two ancillary activities (two hours) to complete the project.

Some research projects also require a **magic research throw** to succeed. The magic research throw is made after the component cost, material cost, and research cost have been paid. To make a magic research throw, the researcher rolls 1d20 and compares the result to the table above. A result that is greater than or equal to themagical research target value listed for the researcher’s level indicates the task has been a success. The researcher adds his Intellect bonus to the die roll, and if he has the Magical Engineering proficiency he may add his proficiency rank. An unmodified die roll of 1 – 3 is always a failure when conducting magical research, however. When a magic research throw fails, all the time, money, materials, and components spent on the research are lost.

In some cases, the researcher may **experiment**. Experimenting always requires a magic research throw, and can have a wondrous or disastrous results. See **Experimentation** later in this chapter.

### Component Cost

When a monster dies, a residue of its soul will linger in some its body parts, such as organs and bodily fluids. These body parts are known as **special components** and can be tapped by spellcasters to power the creation of magic items or the casting of ritual spells. Powerful mages and clerics often send parties of adventurers on quests to slay certain monsters and return with the monsters’ special components. The ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual***lists the special components for each monster in the game as well as the type of magic that component can be used for.

However, sometimes a caster might want to perform magic research for which he doesn’t have a sufficient amount of the appropriate components. The caster can instead pay part or all of the component cost with:

* Arcane power (p. XX) or divine power (p. XX);
* The component cost of an identified magic item for which the caster has the formula (p. XX);
* Miscellaneous components purchased on the market (p. XX); or
* Special components from an inappropriate monster.

The caster suffers a -1 penalty on his throw per level of the spell or effect when using inappropriate or miscellaneous special components in magical research. If the caster uses a blend of the required components and inappropriate or miscellaneous components, the penalty is reduced. Multiply the penalty by the percentage of inappropriate or miscellaneous components. Round the penalty up, with a minimum -1 penalty.

EXAMPLE: Süreus is scribing a **scroll of fireball***.* His research requires 1,500gp worth of greater hellhound fangs. Unfortunately, he has only 500gp worth of fangs so he substitutes 1,000gp of ogre hearts instead. *Fireball* is a 3rd level spell. Süreus suffers a penalty of (-3 x 1000/1,500) = -2. If he used only ogre hearts, the penalty would be -3. If he used 1,000gp of fangs the penalty would be -1.

Note that if any inappropriate or miscellaneous components are used to pay the component cost of a project, the caster cannot benefit from following a formula for that project. A caster can still benefit from following a formula if he pays the component cost arcane power, divine power, or an identified magic item for which he has the formula.

Components are always consumed when used in magic research, whether they be miscellaneous components, identified magic items, etc.

### Research Assistants

Because their magic is a learned art rather than a miracle of faith, studious spellcasters can benefit by working collegially. A studious spellcaster of at least 5th level can manage one **research assistant** plus an additional assistant for each point of his Intellect bonus.

Each research assistant can either directly aid his researcher on the researcher’s own project, or he can work on a semi-independent project under the researcher’s supervision.

* When an assistant directly aids his researcher, he adds his research rate to the project’s total research rate. (In the earlier example, Irial worked as a research assistant to Elaria.)
* When an assistant works on a separate project under his researcher’s supervision, he functions as the researcher for that project. The assistant must have a formula or sample to work from for the project. The project’s research rate is determined by the assistant’s level.

To directly aid a researcher on spell research or item creation, a research assistant must be at least 1st level. To work semi-independently on spell research, brewing potions, or scribing scroll, a research assistant must be at least 3rd level. To work semi-independently on charged or permanent item creation, a research assistant must be at least 7th level.

### Proficiencies and Powers

Some proficiencies and powers may affect magic research.

###### Alchemy

A character with one rank of Alchemy proficiency counts as a 1st level mage for purposes of brewing potions or gains a +1 bonus to alchemy-related magic research throws if already of higher caster level. He gains a research rate of 5gp for alchemy or increases his existing research rate by 5%.

A character with two ranks of Alchemy counts as 3rd level mage for purposing of brewing potions or gains a +2 bonus to alchemy-related magic research throws if already of higher caster level. He gains a research rate of 15gp for alchemy or increases his existing research rate by 10%.

A character with three ranks of Alchemy counts as a 5th level mage for purposes of brewing potions or gains a +3 bonus to alchemy-related magic research throws if already of higher caster level. He can supervise other spellcasters or alchemists brewing potions. He gains a research rate of 50gp for alchemy or increases his existing research rate by 15%.

###### Art/Craft

A mastery of the mundane arts and crafts enables a researcher to focus on the esoteric aspects of his research. When performing Magic Experimentation relating to his Art or Craft proficiency (as determined by the GM), a character can add his ranks in the proficiency to his throw exclusively for purposes of determining whether he has achieved a breakthrough. In addition, a character with 4 ranks in Art or Craft gains one additional experimental advantage any time his experiment relates to his Art or Craft.

###### Other Proficiencies and Powers

**Black Lore of Zahar:** The character’s eligibility to conduct research into death magic and necromancy is determined as if he were two caster levels higher than actual. He gains a +2 bonus on magic research throws and increases his research rate by 10% when researching death magic and necromancy.

**Bright Lore of Aura:** The character’s eligibility to research protection magic is determined as if he were two caster levels higher than actual. He gains a +2 bonus on magic research throws and increases his research rate by 10% when researching protection magic.

**Loremastery:** The character can identify magic items as if he were a 5th level mage. If the character can already identify magic items, he can do so with a +2 bonus to his magic research throw and +10% bonus to his research rate.

**Magical Engineering:** For each rank of Magical Engineering, the character gains a +1 bonus on magic research throws and increases his research rate by 5%. The bonus applies when brewing potions and stacks with Alchemy.

**Mastery of Conjuration & Summoning:** The character’s eligibility to research summoning magic is determined as if he were two caster levels higher than actual. He gains a +2 bonus on magic research throws and increases his research rate by 10% when researching summoning magic.

**Mastery of Enchantments & Illusions:** The character’s eligibility to research enchantment and illusion magic is determined as if he were two caster levels higher than actual. He gains a +2 bonus on magic research throws and increases his research rate by 10% when researching enchantment and illusion magic.

**Transmogrification:** The character’s eligibility to research transmogrification magic and create crossbreeds is determined as if he were two caster levels higher than actual. He gains a +2 bonus on magic research throws and increases his research rate by 10% when researching transmogrification magic and creating crossbreeds.

### Researching Spells

###### Researcher Requirements

Spell research can be undertaken by a spellcaster of 5th level or higher to gain the formula to a common spell that he lacks access to from scrolls or spell books or in order to create the formula to a new spell. When creating a new spell, the spellcaster must describe in detail the kind of spell he wants to create, and the effects it will have. The Judge will then determine if the spell can be created, and if so what the spell level will be*.* Esoteric spells cannot be researched without experimental breakthroughs (p. XX).

The researcher must be capable of casting spells of the spell level of the spell he is researching. After completing spell research, a studious spellcaster gains the formula to the spell. He can then add it to his repertoire by spending one week of practice if desired.

Prayerful divine casters cannot research spells. A prayerful caster who faces an urgent need can pray to his deity to replace a particular spell on his class list with one normally not available to him, but such prayers are rarely granted except to the most powerful casters in times of urgent need for the faith.

###### Cost Requirements

**Component Cost:** None

**Material Cost:** 1,000gp per spell level

**Research Cost:** 1,000gp per spell level

###### Magic Research Throw Requirements

No magic research throw is required to gain the formula to a common spell. A magic research throw is required to create the formula to a new spell. The target value of the throw is increased by the level of the spell.

**Designer’s Note**: The rules are deliberately ambiguous as to what counts as a “common” spell. We’ve left it up to each Judge to decide which spells are common based on how secretive magic-users are in his campaign world. Depending on the campaign, common spells might include every spell published by Autarch in official books, only the spells found in this book, or only spells found on a customized list created by the Judge. Common spells might even be different for different classes, races, or regions. Remember, every campaign is a law unto itself!

###### Other Requirements

**Library:** To research a spell, a researcher must have access to a **library**. Wizard’s guilds often will provide their mages access to such a library. If a spellcaster wishes to compile his own library, a minimum of 4,000gp must be invested to allow research on 1st level spells. For each subsequent spell level to be researched, another 2,000gp must be invested.

Having an exceptionally large library aids research. For every 10,000gp of value above the minimum required for the spell, the spellcaster receives a +1 bonus on his magic research throw (up to a maximum +3 bonus).

Every time a researcher successfully researches a spell, 10% of the gold spent for that effect is added to his library value, reflecting the value of notes and annotations made during research. Authoritative tomes or rare books found as treasure might provide an additional bonus to research specific spells or types of spells.

Two or more researchers can share the same library. When calculating the bonus from large library size, divide the total value of the library by the number of researchers using it using it for different projects. However, regardless of the number of researchers, use the total value of the library to determine the maximum level of spells that can be researched there.

### Creating Magic Items

###### Researcher Requirements

At 5th level, spellcasters may scribe scrolls and brew potions. At 9th level, they may create other types of magic items, such as rods, rings, and swords. In order to create a magic item, the spellcaster must have the spell(s) that replicate the magic item’s effect in his repertoire, or must find a sample or formula of the item. If a magic item has an effect that does not compare to any existing spell, the spellcaster must either research a new spell that will produce the desired effect, or he must find a sample or formula of the item.

An arcane spellcaster may make any type of magic item except those with healing effects. A divine spellcaster may only make items his class is eligible to use. For instance, a 9th level bladedancer could create a **sword +1**, **leather armor +1**, or **staff of healing**, but not a **bow +1** or **wand of fireball**. Casters cannot create activated or permanent items with esoteric spells unless experimenting (p. XX).

###### Cost Requirements

The component, material, and research costs are shown on the table below. The Effect Types are clarified after the table.

| \*But not more than 1/day; \*\*But not more than 1/hour | | | |

**Effect Types:** Different types of effects have different restrictions.

* A **one-use effect** typically may only be imbued in a potion or a scroll. Its duration, caster level, usage requirements, and usage time are determined by the type of item. Otherwise, count it as a single-use miscellaneous charged item as below. Examples: **potion of healing**,**scroll of fireball***.*
* A **charged effect** may be imbued in any type of non-consumable item. Its caster level, usage requirements, and usage time are determined by the type of item. If a charged item has multiple spell effects powered by the same charges, use the base cost for the highest-level spell effect, plus half the cost for each other spell effect. There are four types of charged items:
  + **Wands:** Wands are 1’ to 2’ long batons that weigh 1/6 stone. When created a wand must have at least 10 and no more than 20 charges. The effects of a wand are at minimum caster level +1 for the effect. Wands can only be used by arcane spellcasters.
  + **Rods:** Rods are 2’ to 4’ long shafts that weigh 3/6 stone. When created a rod must have at least 6 and no more than 12 charges. The effects of a rod are at minimum caster level +2 for the effect. Rods can be used by either or both arcane or divine spellcasters, as decided by the creator.
  + **Staffs:** Staffs are 6’ long, 2” thick poles that weigh 1 stone. When created a staff must have at least 15 and no more than 30 charges. The effect of a staff are at minimum caster level +3 for the effect. Staffs can be used by either or both arcane or divine spellcasters, as decided by the creator.
  + **Miscellaneous:** Any other items made as charged items must weigh at least 1/6 stone. The effects of a miscellaneous charged item are at minimum caster level for the effect. Miscellaneous charged items can be used by either or both arcane or divine spellcasters, or by specific classes, as decided by the creator.
* An **activated effect** can be imbued in any type of non-consumable item. Any spell effect can be imbued as an activated effect. An activated effect can be **dispelled***,* but the item’s user can reactivate the effect subject to its usage limits. Examples: **crystal ball**.
* An **at-will effect** can be imbued in any type of non-consumable item. A spell effect can only be imbued into an at-will item if it has a duration of concentration. Instantaneous or limited duration effects cannot be made at-will! An at-will concentration effect can be **dispelled**, but the item’s user can reactivate the effect the following round. Example: **helm of telepathy**.
* A **permanent effect** can be imbued in any type of non-consumable item. Unlike other effects, a permanent effect cannot be **dispelled**even temporarily. A spell effect can only be imbued permanently if it has a duration of at least 1 turn (10 minutes) and if it only targets the wearer(s) or user(s) of an item while it is worn or used. The cost of imbuing a permanent effect is based on the duration of the spell effect used. For example, to permanently imbue a spell with a 12 turn duration would require a component cost of 500gp x spell level x 24, as its duration is more than 1 hour, but less than 1 day. Examples:**gauntlets of ogre strength, witch’s broom**.
* A **permanent bonus** can be imbued into armor, shields, and weapons. 5 darts or 20 arrows, bolts, and slingstones can be enchanted as one item. If the weapon or armor has a bonus that is restricted to a particular class or type of opponents, the extra bonus is half price. If the weapon or armor is enchanted with spell-like effects, the spell-like effects are enchanted separately using the cost and time for charged or permanent effects. Permanent bonuses cannot be **dispelled**.

At the Judge’s discretion, ritual effects imbued into an item may violate these limits.

**Component Cost:** The Judge determines the special components required for each item. If a character does not have a formula when he begins creating the item, he will not learn the components required until 50% of the labor cost has been paid. Usually the component cost for magic items must be paid with various monster parts from one or more monsters with a total XP value equal to the gp cost of the research.

Different formulas for the same item may require different components. For instance, one formula for a **wand of fireball** might require the fangs of 20 hellhounds, while another formula for a **wand of fireball** might require the ichor of four efreeti.

**Reducing Cost with Drawbacks:** Some magic items may carry **drawbacks** that hamper or limit the user of the item. Drawbacks should be assigned a cost based on their effect level and frequency. The cost of the drawback is subtracted from the costs of the item. Drawbacks may be a constant hazard from carrying or using an item, or may occur with the same frequency as the use of the item itself. If a drawback is a constant trouble, the discount is equal to the drawback’s cost as an effect; if the drawback only occurs when an item is activated, the discount is a max of half the costs of the effect which the drawback applies to.

An item can have a total max discount (from any or all drawbacks) of half the item’s costs. The effect level can be calculated as a negative spell or at the Judge’s discretion. When drawbacks can be calculated in terms of a spell (the inverse of an AC or saving throw bonus, a negative effect suffered, etc.), the Judge should round the level down — a 13-point negative spell is a 1st level drawback. A drawback that does not actually disadvantage normal users of the item does not give any cost discount (Judge’s discretion). It does not reduce the cost of an item to limit its powers to specific users (such as a specific class or race), as this is as much an advantage as it is a disadvantage.

###### Magic Research Throw Requirements

A magic research throw is required to create a magic item unless the researcher has a formula for the item. The target value of the throw is increased by the level of the spell effect imbued. If multiple effects are being imbued, use the total level of all spell effects (except for charged items, see above). A +1 item bonus is considered a 1st level spell, a +2 item bonus is considered a single 3rd level spell, and a +3 item bonus is considered a single 6th level spell. If the researcher is working from a sample, he gains a +4 bonus to the magic research throw.

###### Other Requirements

**Formulas and Samples:** While not technically “required,” formulas and samples are very useful for magic item creation.

A **formula** is a magical recipe for the creation of an item. A researcher automatically has a formula for any magic item he has previously created. Formulas may also be recovered from ancient ruins, found in esoteric libraries, purchased or stolen from other spellcasters, and so on. When a researcher has a formula for a magic item, the researcher:

* knows the special components required to pay the component cost before he begins the project;
* can enchant that magic item without having to learn or invent the spells imbued in the item; and
* does not have to make a magic research throw to complete the magic item, unless he is experimenting.

A **sample** is simply an existing magic item that is available to the spellcaster while he is working. When a researcher has a sample for a magic item, the researcher:

* can enchant that magic item without having to learn or invent the spells imbued in the item; and
* gains a +4 bonus on his magic research throw to complete the magic item.

**Workshops:** Just as a spellcaster needs a library to research spells, he needs a **workshop** in order to create magic items. Wizards’ guilds and major temples often will provide their mages and crusaders access to a workshop. If a spellcaster wishes to build his own workshop, a minimum of 4,000gp must be invested to allow creation of 1st level spell effects or item bonuses. For each subsequent spell level or bonus, another 2,000gp must be invested.

Having an exceptionally valuable workshop aids item creation. For every 10,000gp of value above the minimum required for the item, the spellcaster gains a +1 bonus on his magic research throw (up to a maximum +3 bonus).

Two or more researchers can share the same workshop. When calculating the bonus from large workshops, divide the total value of the workshop by the number of researchers using it for different projects. However, regardless of the number of researchers, use the total value of the workshop to determine the maximum level of spells that can be researched there.

EXAMPLE: Hearing tales of the legendary **Bow of the Great Eagles**, Rigan wishes to commission a similar weapon, but lacks the funds for such a grand project. Elaria proposes crafting a cheaper alternative: a **composite bow +3** (base cost 35,000gp) that can grant the wielder the Precise Shooting proficiency for 12 turns 3/day (3rd level effect, base cost 18,000gp), with a couple shortcuts in the creation process to cut costs. Rigan soon finds that these shortcuts come with a toll: animals are wary of him while carrying his new bow (1st level permanent drawback: reversed beast friendship proficiency, -25,000gp), and whenever he is shooting more precisely his reaction time is slowed (2nd level 3/day drawback: -1 initiative penalty custom power with 12 turn duration, -12,000gp). The cost of his bow is calculated like so: 35,000gp + 18,000gp = 53,000gp (determine pre-discount cost); 18,000gp – 12,000gp = 9,000gp (apply discounts for any activated effects, with a max discount of 1/2 the cost of each effect); 35,000gp + 9000gp – 25,000gp = 26,500gp final cost (apply discounts for permanent effects, with a max total discount of 1/2 the pre-discount cost). Rigan dubs it the **Bow of the Half-Decent Falcon**, much to Elaria’s annoyance.

### Identifying Magic Items

###### Researcher Requirements

Magic item research can be undertaken by a spellcaster of 5th level or higher to discover the properties and command words associated with a particular magic item.

###### Cost Requirements

**Component Cost:** None

**Material Cost:** 1,000gp.

**Research Cost:** 1,000gp.

###### Magic Research Throw Requirements

A magic research throw is required to discover the properties of a magic item. The target value of the throw is increased by the level of the spells imbued into the item (as above).

###### Other Requirements

**Library:** The researcher must have access to a library (his own or shared, as above) at least equal in value to the cost of the research. For every 10,000gp of value above the minimum required for the research, the researcher receives a +1 bonus on his magic research throw.

**Sample:** The researcher must have a sample, that is, he must be able to study the item he is researching. The sample must be intact and functional, with at least one charge if a charged item.

### Designing Constructs

###### Researcher Requirements

Spellcasters who reach 11th level or higher can design magical **constructs** similar to animated statues, gargoyles, and golems. Because of their proficiency with crafts, dwarven craftpriests can design magical constructs starting at 9th level. The spellcaster is limited to designing constructs with HD no more than twice his class level.

The designer of a construct can reverse-engineer the design from a sample or design from scratch. If designing from scratch, he will determine all of its characteristics, as explained below. The researcher must decide on the characteristics will take before beginning the actual process of design.

**Type:** All constructs are, obviously, constructs! If the designer is also capable of granting unlife (see below), he can design an undead construct. All constructs are enchanted creatures for purposes of spells such as *dispel evil* and *holy circle*.

**Body Form:** Constructs can have any desired body form.

**Movement:** Constructs will have their movement capabilities determined by its body form. Other movement capabilities can be selected as minor or major special abilities, as per the ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual****.*

**Armor Class**: Constructs will have a default Armor Class equal to half their Hit Dice. The construct’s body form or size can further modify its AC. Improvements to AC can be selected as minor or major special abilities as per the ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual****.*

**Immunities:** Because they are not truly alive, constructs are immune to enchantment effects and poisonous damage. These collectively count as one major special ability. Constructs can be given additional resistances or immunities, such as immunity to non-magical weapons, if desired. Additional resistances and immunities count as between 1 minor (#) and 1 major (\*) special ability, as per the ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual***.

**Hit Dice**: Constructs must have a minimum of 1 HD. The spellcaster is limited to designing constructs with HD no more than twice his class level.

**Weight and Size:** Constructs’ weight and size will be determined using their HD and the body mass exponent (BME) as if they were a living creature, according to the rules in the ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual***. Then multiply weight by 2.5 to reflect the sturdy materials used in constructs. (Bronze, iron, and other constructs can be assumed to be partly hollow, or otherwise weight would be 6-20x). Undead constructs weigh 50% as much as living creatures. Halving a construct’s weight counts as two minor special abilities.

**Attacks**: Constructs may have from one to four attacks per round selected from those available to their body form. Their attacks may inflict up to three times their HD in maximum damage per round. This damage may be divided among all their attacks as desired. Any special attacks or powers count as minor or major special abilities, as per the ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual***.

**Morale:** If mindless, morale is not applicable. If of animal or sapient intelligence, constructs have morale scores of +4.

**Special Abilities:** Constructs can have one or more additional minor or major special abilities selected from the list in the ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual****.* The spellcaster must have spells in his repertoire that emulate any desired spell-like or supernatural abilities. For instance, a mage cannot imbue a construct with the power to magically teleport if he doesn’t have *teleportation* in his repertoire.

**Special Disabilities:** Constructs can have major and/or minor special disabilities like those in the ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual***. Special disabilities reduce the cost of constructs as if they were negative special abilities.

**Intellect:** Most constructs are mindless. Constructs can be designed to have animal intelligence at a cost of one major special ability (\*) or sapient intelligence at a cost of two major special abilities (\*\*).

**Alignment:** If mindless, the construct’s alignment is Neutral, or Chaotic if undead. Otherwise the construct’s alignment is the same as that of its designer.

###### Cost Requirements

**Component Cost:** Designing a construct does not require any special components.

**Material Cost:** 2,000gp per Hit Die of the construct, plus an additional 625gp per minor special ability and 5,000gp per major special ability.

**Research Cost:** 2,000gp per Hit Die of the construct, plus an additional 625gp per minor special ability and 5,000gp per major special ability.

###### Magic Research Throw Requirements

A magic research throw is required to design a construct. The target value for this throw is increased by +1 for every 5,000gp the construct costs. If the throw is successful, the researcher gains a formula that can be used to manufacture the construct. If the researcher is reverse-engineering from a sample, he gains a +4 bonus to the magic research throw.

###### Other Requirements

**Library:** To design a construct, the researcher must have access to a library (his own or shared, as above) at least equal in value to the cost of the construct throughout the design process. For every 10,000gp of value above the minimum required for the construct, the spellcaster receives a +1 bonus on his magic research throw (up to a maximum +3 bonus).

**Sample:** A sample is required to reverse engineer the design of an existing construct. A sample need not be intact or functional — the remains of a construct destroyed in battle can serve as a sample. A sample is not required to design a construct from scratch.

### Manufacturing Constructs

###### Researcher Requirements

Spellcasters who reach 11th level or higher can manufacture magical **constructs** similar to animated statues, gargoyles, and golems. Because of their proficiency with crafts, dwarven craftpriests can manufacture magical constructs starting at 9th level. The spellcaster is limited to manufacturing constructs with HD no more than twice his class level.

###### Cost Requirements

**Component Cost:** Manufacturing a construct does not require any special components in most cases. However, if the construct being manufactured is undead, the manufacturer must supply one or more dead bodies with the same body form as the construct and a total weight equal to or greater than the construct’s weight.

**Material Cost:** 2,000gp per Hit Die of the construct, plus an additional 625gp per minor special ability and 5,000gp per major special ability.

**Research Cost:** 2,000gp per Hit Die of the construct, plus an additional 625gp per minor special ability and 5,000gp per major special ability.

###### Magic Research Throw Requirements

A magic research throw is required to manufacture a construct. The target value for this throw is increased by +1 for every 5,000gp the construct costs. If the throw is successful, the researcher successfully manufactures the construct.

A mindless construct is automatically under the control of its manufacturer. Otherwise, the Judge should make a reaction roll to determine the construct’s reaction to the caster. If the construct is unfriendly or hostile, the researcher could try to control it using spells, or imprison it in his dungeon, or simply unleash it onto the world.

###### Other Requirements

**Formula or Sample:** The researcher must have a manufacturing formula for the construct he wishes to create. Formula can be found as treasure in rare manuals, or designed by the research (see above). A sample is insufficient, though it can be used to reverse engineer the formula (see above).

**Workshop:** To manufacture a construct, the researcher must have access to a workshop (his own or shared, as above) at least equal in value to the cost of the construct throughout the manufacturing process. (If the construct is undead, the manufacturer must have a **mortuary and embalming chamber** instead, as described below). For every 10,000gp of value above the minimum required for the construct, the spellcaster receives a +1 bonus on his magic research throw.

EXAMPLE: Quintus, an 11th level mage with 16 INT, is designing a golem from scratch. Therefore he gets to determine all of its characteristics freely. He chooses to design a humanoid construct with 10 HD. He assigns it a BME of 1.88, giving it a weight of 5,754 lbs; this is then multiplied by 2.5 to reflect construct materials, for a final weight of 14,385 lbs. As a humanoid, it has a speed of 120’. At 10 HD, it has a default AC of 5. He wants it to be immune to acid (##), cold (##), fire (##), and lightning (##) in addition to its standard construct immunities to poison and enchantment effects (\*). Since eight minor abilities (#) counts as one major special ability (\*), the construct has a total of two major special abilities (\*\*). The construct can inflict a maximum of 30 damage per round, and Quintus decides to give it one slam attack dealing 3d10 bludgeoning damage.

This gives the construct a materials cost and research cost of (2,000gp x 10) + (5,000 x 2) = 30,000gp. As an 11th level mage, Quintus has a research rate of 1,750gp per day, so it will take him about 18 days to complete the design. He is working from a library with a value of 40,000gp. The magic research throw value to design the construct is 12+ (base 6+ plus 30,000/5,000) but Quintus gets a bonus of +2 for his INT bonus and +1 for the library quality [(40,000-30,000)/(10,000)]. Quintus will therefore need to throw 9+ to succeed. He rolls a 14 and succeeds. He names his new design a granite golem.

Now that he has the formula for the granite golem, Quintus can manufacture it. The construct’s manufacture will cost him another 30,000gp in materials and research. As an 11th level mage, Quintus has a research rate of 1,750gp per day, so it will take him about 18 days to complete the construct. He will need a workshop of at least 30,000gp in order to manufacture the golem and will need to succeed on another magic research throw of 12+, modified by his INT and any bonus from his workshop quality.

### Crossbreeds

###### Researcher Requirements

Arcane and eldritch spellcasters who reach 11th level or higher may create **crossbreeds** by magically blending different progenitor creatures together.

The progenitor creatures must not have HD greater than the arcane spellcaster’s class level, and cannot have more than one major special ability (\*) plus one major special ability per point of the spellcaster’s attribute bonus from Intellect. Eight minor special abilities (#) count as one major special ability.

EXAMPLE: Quintus, an 11th level mage with 16 INT, can crossbreed from 11 HD progenitors each with 3 major special abilities or 24 minor special abilities or any equivalent combination thereof.

The creator of a magical crossbreed will imbue it with various features and abilities drawn from their progenitors, as explained below. The researcher must decide on the form his crossbreed will take before beginning the actual process of creating the crossbreed.

**Type:** Crossbreeds are usually monstrosities. However, they might also or instead be animals, beastmen, giant humanoids, humanoids, incarnations, oozes, or vermin, depending on their progenitors and their characteristics (Judge’s discretion).

**Body Form:** The crossbreed can have the body form of either progenitor or a hybrid body form.

**Movement:** The crossbreed will have the movement capabilities of whichever progenitor’s body form it took. If it has a hybrid body form, it can have the movement capabilities of either or both progenitors. If it has the movement of both, this counts as a major special ability.

**Armor Class**: The crossbreed will have the AC of the progenitor from which it was assigned its movement capabilities. If it has the movement of both, it will have whichever AC is better.

**Hit Dice**: The researcher can assign his crossbreed the HD of either progenitor, or any amount in between.

**Weight and Size:** The crossbreed’s weight and size will be determined using its HD and the body mass exponent (BME) of its body form according to the rules in the ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual***. If it has a hybrid body form, it can have the BME of either progenitor, or any amount in between.

**Attacks**: The crossbreed will have the attacks of whichever progenitor’s body form it took. If it has a hybrid body form, it can be assigned the attacks of either or both progenitors. If it has the attacks of both, this counts as a major special ability. If the crossbreed is of greater HD than the progenitor from which it draws its attacks, the damage inflicted by the attacks will be scaled up proportionate to the increase in Hit Dice.

**Morale:** A crossbreed can be assigned the morale of either progenitor, or any amount in between.

**Special Abilities:** A crossbreed can have the major and/or minor special abilities of one, both, or none of its progenitors. Since the number of special abilities permitted is capped, and each special ability makes the crossbreed more expensive and difficult to create, the researcher may opt to drop some or all special abilities of either or both progenitors.

**Special Disabilities:** A crossbreed can have the major and/or minor special disabilities of one, both, or none of its progenitors. Special disabilities reduce the cost of the crossbreed as if they were negative special abilities.

**Special Senses:** A crossbreed can have the visual senses and other senses of one, both, or none of its progenitors, paying for them as special abilities. Any crossbreed can be given lightless vision (60’) at a cost of two minor abilities regardless of progenitors.

**Intellect:** The crossbreed might be of mindless, animal, semi-sapient, or sapient intelligence depending on its progenitors. If both progenitors are mindless, the crossbreed must be mindless. If either progenitor is of animal intelligence, the progenitor can be of animal intelligence. If both are of animal intelligence, the progenitor must be of animal intelligence. If either progenitor is sapient, the crossbreed can be sapient. If both are sapient, the progenitor must be, too. The researcher can decide to preserve the memory and personality of one of the progenitors, if desired.

**Alignment:** If either progenitor is Chaotic, the crossbreed will be Chaotic. If both progenitors are Lawful, the crossbreed will be Lawful. Otherwise the crossbreed will be Neutral.

**Other Characteristics:** Whatever their type, crossbreeds heal naturally, and can reproduce with others of their breed. If they still closely resemble one of their progenitors, they can breed with them as well. It has a lifespan and reproductive cycle mid-way between its progenitors. If the caster wishes the crossbreed to have the lifespan and reproductive cycle of just one progenitor, this counts as a special ability.

A magical crossbreed is not automatically under the control of the caster. If the researcher preserved the memory and personality of a progenitor, the magical crossbreed will have the same relationship with the caster as the progenitor did. Otherwise, the Judge should make a reaction roll to determine the crossbreed’s reaction to the caster. If the crossbreed is unfriendly or hostile, the caster could try to tame, train, or **bewitch** it using specialists or spells; imprison it in his dungeon; or just unleash it onto the world.

###### Cost Requirements

**Component Cost:** Creating a crossbreed does not require any special components beyond the progenitor creatures themselves (which are irrevocably killed in the process). A researcher can use himself as a progenitor if desired.

**Material Cost:** 2,000gp per Hit Die of the crossbreed, plus an additional 625gp per minor special ability and 5,000gp per major special ability.

**Research Cost:** 2,000gp per Hit Die of the crossbreed, plus an additional 625gp per minor special ability and 5,000gp per major special ability.

###### Magic Research Throw Requirements

A magic research throw is required to create a crossbreed. The target value for this throw is increased by +1 for every 5,000gp the crossbreeding costs. The success or failure of the crossbreeding will not be known until the progenitors are killed in the attempt.

###### Other Requirements

**Crossbreeding Laboratory:** The spellcaster must have access to a special **crossbreeding laboratory** at least equal in value to the cost of the crossbreed. For every 10,000gp of value above the minimum required for the crossbreed, the spellcaster receives a +1 bonus on his magic research throw.

### Performing Necromancy

###### Researcher Requirements

Chaotic spellcasters who reach 11th level or higher may transform a recently-deceased subject into an intelligent undead monster through the black arts of necromancy.

The subject must be dead when the project is completed, but it can only have been dead for 1 day per HD, so it is often best if preparations are begun before the subject dies or is killed. A spellcaster may transform himself into an intelligent undead using necromancy if desired, by killing himself or having himself killed at the conclusion of the project.

The new undead’s form must not have HD greater than the caster level. In addition, if the subject is transformed into corporeal undead, its undead body must remain in approximately the same form and size as it possessed in life. Subject to these limitations, the researcher can transform the creature into any type of undead with which he is familiar. New types of undead with previously unseen powers can be created only via experimentation.

EXAMPLE: Quintus, an 11th level mage with 16 INT, can transform creatures into undead with up to 11 HD with 3 special abilities each.

An undead monster created through necromancy is not automatically under the control of the caster. If the subject creature was a willing participant in the necromancy, it will retain its friendly relationship with the caster when it becomes undead. Otherwise, the Judge should make a reaction roll to determine the undead’s reaction to the caster. If the undead monster is unfriendly or hostile, the caster could try to control it using spells, or imprison it in his dungeon, or simply unleash it onto the world.

###### Cost Requirements

**Component Cost:** Transforming a creature into an undead monster requires special components, usually (as if with magic items) organs or blood from one or more monsters with a total XP value equal to the cost of the research. If the undead has special abilities the creature providing the components must have at least as many special abilities. The Judge will determine the specific components based on the necromancy involved. If the undead has particular needs (a phylactery, coffin, etc.) these must also be provided. If the researcher doesn’t know the components at the outset of the necromancy, he learns them when 50% of the labor cost has been paid.

**Material Cost:** 2,000gp per Hit Die of the undead, plus an additional 625gp per minor special ability and 5,000gp per major special ability.

**Research Cost:** 2,000gp per Hit Die of the undead, plus an additional 625gp per minor special ability and 5,000gp per major special ability.

###### Magic Research Throw Requirements

A magic research throw is required to grant unlife. If the creature is willing, the target value for this throw is increased by +1 for every 5,000gp of necromancy costs. If the creature is unwilling, the target value for the throw is increased by +2 for every 5,000gp. The success or failure of the necromancy will not be known until the creature is dead.

###### Other Requirements

**Mortuary and Embalming Chamber:** To perform necromancy, the researcher must have access to a private **mortuary and embalming chamber** at least equal in value to the cost of the necromancy. For every 10,000gp of value above the minimum required for the necromancy, the spellcaster receives a +1 bonus on his magic research throw. By using precious materials, the spellcaster can gain a bonus on his magic research throw, as described above.

### Learning Ritual Spells

###### Researcher Requirements

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Caster Level** | **Ritual Spell Repertoire** |
| 11 | 1 + key attribute modifier |
| 12 | 2 + key attribute modifier |
| 13 | 3 + key attribute modifier |
| 14 | 4 + key attribute modifier |

Ritual spells are very powerful dweomers of 7th, 8th, or 9th spell level. Only spellcasters of 11th level or higher can learn ritual spells. Each ritual spell must be learned separately through research. When a researcher learns a ritual spell, he gains a copy of its formula (if he does not have it already) and adds it to his repertoire. A researcher can have any number of ritual spell formulas, but he can only keep a small number of ritual spells of each level in his repertoire, as shown on the Ritual Spell Repertoire table.

EXAMPLE: Quintus, an 11th level mage with 16 Intellect, could learn 3 arcane ritual spells of each level. Balbus, a 14th level crusader with 14 Will, could learn 5 divine ritual spells of each level.

###### Cost Requirements

**Component Cost:** None

**Material Cost:** 50,000gp for 7th level; 100,000gp for 8th level; 200,000gp for 9th level

**Research Cost:** 50,000gp for 7th level; 100,000gp for 8th level; 200,000gp for 9th level

###### Magic Research Throw Requirements

A magic research throw is required to learn a ritual spell unless the researcher has a formula for the ritual. The target value of the throw is increased by the level of the ritual spell.

###### Other Requirements

**Library:** The researcher must have access to a library (his own or shared, as above). The minimum library value is 16,000gp for 7th level spells; 18,000gp for 8th level spells; and 20,000gp for 9th level spells. For every 10,000gp of value above the minimum required for the spell, the spellcaster receives a +1 bonus on his magic research throw (up to a maximum +3 bonus).

**Formula:** If a researcher has the formula for a ritual spell, he can learn it without making a magic research throw. He still must pay the material cost and research cost.

### Casting Ritual Spells

###### Researcher Requirements

Spellcasters of 11th level or higher can cast ritual spells from their repertoire of rituals they have learned.

###### Cost Requirements

**Component Cost:** 50,000gp for 7th level; 100,000gp for 8th level; 200,000gp for 9th level. The special components required to cast the ritual will be known from the ritual spell’s formula. Usually the component cost for ritual spells must be paid with various monster parts from one or more monsters with a total XP value equal to the gp cost of the research. Some ritual spells have even more esoteric requirements. Ritual spells can never use miscellaneous components.

**Material Cost:** 50,000gp for 7th level; 100,000gp for 8th level; 200,000gp for 9th level

**Research Cost:** 50,000gp for 7th level; 100,000gp for 8th level; 200,000gp for 9th level

###### Magic Research Throw Requirements

A magic research throw is required to cast a ritual spell. The target value of the throw is increased by the level of the ritual spell. When a ritual spell is successfully cast, the spellcaster can choose to have the ritual take effect immediately, or he can store the spell effect on a scroll or as a charge in a ring (like a **ring of wishes**), rod, staff, or wand. Storing the spell effect does not have an additional cost — the act of casting a ritual spell is identical to that of creating a single charge of a magic item with the spell effect. Ritual spells can never be enchanted as activated, at-will, or permanent magic items.

###### Other Requirements

**Workshop:** The researcher must have access to a **workshop**. The minimum workshop value is 16,000gp for 7th level spells; 18,000gp for 8th level spells; and 20,000gp for 9th level spells. For every 10,000gp of value above the minimum required for the spell, the spellcaster receives a +1 bonus on his magic research throw (up to a maximum +3 bonus).

### Sample Ritual Spells

A short list of ritual spells is provided below. The Judge can make available additional rituals spells from a variety of other compatible fantasy games or develop a list of ritual spells unique to his campaign using the rules in ***ACKS II Judges Journal****.*

###### Apotheosis

Arcane 9, Divine 9 Type: ritual, transmogrification

Range: touch Duration: instantaneous

The Empyrean faiths teach that after death, the body must be burned so that Calefa can swiftly usher the soul to the afterlife, where its valor is weighed by Türas. Base and sordid souls drink of the waters of sorrow and return again to the realms of man in a new body. Noble, heroic souls pass to the Empyrean Heaven as Exalted beings, to dwell in the glory of the halls of Ammonar. The Chthonic cults teach that this is a lie, and that the souls of the dead are dissolved into chaos upon death. Only by achieving undeath can the individual soul survive until the Awakening incarnates all the faithful.

Esoteric practitioners of both faiths admit to the possibility of a third path, one that transcends death and undeath, and bypasses the judgment of the Empyrean gods and the slumber of the Chthonic ones. The ritual of *apotheosis* allows a living or undead creature to transfigure into an immortal without ever dying.

When the ritual is complete, the recipient of the spell (who can be the caster or another of the same alignment) must make a Death saving throw. If the recipient is a Zaharan or other race with the Dark Souls racial weakness, he suffers a -1 penalty on the save per class level unless he has first transformed himself unto undead. If the recipient’s saving throws are improved by magic items or spells, those bonuses do not apply, but saving throw bonuses from class powers, proficiencies, and racial powers do apply.

If the saving throw fails, the recipient’s soul proves too weak to achieve immortality. His very existence is obliterated forever, with not even ritual magic able to restore him to life.

If the saving throw succeeds, the subject is transformed into a divine being. Update the recipient’s characteristics as noted:

* The recipient’s monster type becomes **incarnation**. As an incarnation, he gains an indefinite lifespan and no longer needs to consume food or water to survive. He can no longer be affected by spells or effects that only target living creatures.
* The recipient retains all of his attributes and preserves his sex. He mostly maintains his physical appearance, but it is always transformed in some way based on his alignment, faith, powers, and deeds. The Judge determines the final appearance.
* The recipient is healed of any existing permanent wounds or side effects of tampering with mortality.
* The recipient retains all of his earned XP, class powers, and racial abilities. He advances thereafter following the rules for transformed characters in the ***ACKS II Judges Journal***.
* The recipient’s Hit Die is increased to d8 per level of experience. If the recipient already had d6 Hit Dice, he gains a permanent +2 bonus to AC as well. If the recipient already had d8 Hit Dice, he gains a permanent +4 bonus to AC. If the recipient has a higher HD, it remains unaltered and the recipient gains a permanent +4 bonus to AC.
* The recipient’s attack throw progression is increased to the monster progression. If the recipient already had crusader or thief progression, he gains a +2 bonus to damage from attacks. If the recipient already had fighter progression, he gains a +4 bonus to damage from attacks. The damage bonus does not apply to spells.
* The recipient gains lightless vision (90’) and permanent *telepathy* (as the spell).
* The recipient becomes aligned with another sphere of existence – either the sphere of empyrean heaven, the sphere of chthonic darkness, or one of the four elemental spheres. The sphere is determined by the Judge based on the character’s alignment, faith, powers, and deeds. He can *teleport* without error as a movement action to and from his aligned sphere, arriving at whatever location on the sphere is geo-spiritually “analogous” to the location from which he departed.
* The recipient becomes immune to mundane damage and poison damage. He also becomes immune to one other type of damage, depending on which sphere he aligns himself with: empyrean heaven – luminous; chthonic darkness – necrotic; elemental air – electric; elemental earth – seismic; elemental fire – fire; elemental water – cold.
* The recipient can become **incorporeal** at will as a movement action. When the recipient becomes incorporeal, all his worn and carried objects also become incorporeal. He can, but does not have to, become **invisible**and **inaudible**while incorporeal. While incorporeal, the recipient can *scry* (as the spell) any shrine or temple dedicated to his worship, and *teleport* there without error by expending a movement action.
* The recipient’s immortal existence must hereafter be sustained by worship. Calculate the recipient’s XP value as if he were a monster with \*\*\*\*\* (5 special abilities). Each day, he must consume arcane power or divine power equal to 6% of his XP value. If he fails to consume enough power, his HD drop by 1. He can re-gain lost HD by catching up on missing power. If reduced to 0 HD, he is forced into a deathless incorporeal torpor until his worship resumes – which may be never.
* The recipient can hereafter absorb arcane power and divine power from worship and can expend this power directly to cast spells, grant spells to divine casters who worship him, undertake magic research, or simply sustain his existence. He can also consume divine power to increase his vitality, gaining 1 campaign XP per gp value of divine power. Appendix C: Cosmology in the ***ACKS Judges Journal***provides the costs of spells cast with arcane and divine power.

The component cost for this spell can only be paid with arcane power, divine power, or special components extracted from incarnations. If divine power is used, the deity which granted the divine power must consent to the ritual, and will expect the newly-ascended immortal to serve as an angel, demon, or demigod in his service.

###### Cataclysm

Divine 9 Type: blast, ritual

Range: special Duration: 1 day

This ritual unleashes the full wrath of the caster’s god. The nature of the *cataclysm*will depend on the deity the spellcaster serves: Ammonar, Lord of the Dawn, favors a meteor from the heavens; Telith, the Earth Mother, often sends earthquakes, and Dirgion, the Doom Lord, prefers a rain of hellfire. Regardless of its form, a *cataclysm*will affect one domain with an area of up to 16 6-mile hexes (or 1 24-mile hex). It will affect both the domain and any urban settlement within the domain, but each should be treated separately.

A *cataclysm* has unlimited range, but the caster must have either visited the target domain, or personally met the ruler of the target domain. *Cataclysm* cannot be cast against the domain of a ruler of the same alignment in good standing with the caster’s religion; it is usually reserved for punishing terrible heresies or destroying foes during holy wars. A *cataclysm*’s component cost can only be paid for with divine power (p. XX).

Once the *cataclysm*ritual is begun, ominous signs and portents (swelling tides, falling stars, rippling fault-lines, etc.) will warn the inhabitants of the target domain of their imminent doom. The signs and portents will increase in frequency as the ritual nears completion. (If the *cataclysm* has been crafted into a magic item such that it can be cast immediately, then the *cataclysm* takes place one week after it is cast, with daily portents of increasing gravity.)

A *miracle*or *wish*, if available, can be used during this time period to avert the *cataclysm*. The death of the ritual’s caster will also avert the *cataclysm*. Left unchecked, the actual *cataclysm* will occur when the ritual is completed. A *cataclysm* cannot be **dispelled**.

If it is allowed to occur, the *cataclysm*devastates the target domain. The extent of damage caused by the *cataclysm* will depend on the population density of the affected domain. For every 1,000 families in a domain, each stronghold and each urban settlement will lose 3d6 x 1000gp in value, and 1d10 x 100 families will be slain. (Where the number of dice is quite large, the Judge can simply use the average values or use an online die rolling tool). If the remaining stronghold value or urban investment value in the hex is too low to sustain the domain’s population, it will immediately lose any excess population as the population scatters. A domain subject to a *cataclysm*must also make an immediate domain morale roll with a -4 penalty.

EXAMPLE: Mentu the Death-Priest, theocrat of Dirgion, unleashes a *cataclysm* on the domain of Aura itself. A band of heroes fails to stop him in time, and the *cataclysm*occurs as rains of hellfire plummets downward. Aura has a population of 12,500 plus an urban settlement with 100,000 families. Its stronghold value is 720,000gp and its urban investment is 2,500,000gp. The *cataclysm* causes the loss of (12,500 / 1000 x 1d10 x 100) 12d10 x 100 peasant families and (100,000 / 1000 x 1d10 x 100) 100d10 x 100 urban families. The dice result in the loss of 5,700 peasant families and 54,400 urban families. The *cataclysm*also causes the loss of (12,500 / 1000 x 3d6 x 1000gp) 36d6 x 1000gp in stronghold value and (100,000 / 1000 x 3d6 x 1000gp) 300d6 x 1000gp in urban investment. The dice result in the loss of 132,000gp in stronghold value and 1,085,000gp in urban investment.

###### Consonant Transit

Arcane 8, Divine 8 Type: movement, ritual

Range: touch Duration: special

This ritual allows the caster to harmonize the hyperdimensional orbit of the celestial sphere of Cybele with that of another sphere of existence within the Cosmos, allowing two-way transit between the two: one instant of transit to the target sphere, and one later instant to travel back.

The material cost for *consonant transit* must be expended in the creation of a transit frame, which resembles a cube circumscribed by ethereal figments. The specific composition of the frame is dictated by the destination sphere. The cost of the frame is determined by its size, quality, and intended destination. The frame can transit one passenger per 25 square feet. The minimum cost is 100,000gp (the material cost for this ritual.)

|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Frame Quality | Elemental Sphere (any) | Celestial Sphere (any) | Chthonic Darkness | Empyrean Heaven |
| Low | 500gp per 25sf | 1000gp per 25sf | 2,500gp per 25sf | 50,000gp per 25sf |
| Medium | 5,000gp per 25sf | 10,000gp per 25sf | 25,000gp per 25sf | 500,000gp per 25sf |
| High | 25,000gp per 25sf | 50,000gp per 25sf | 125,000gp per 25sf | 2,500,000gp per 25sf |

EXAMPLE: Tirenius wishes to create a transit frame that will be able to convey himself and his three companions into the Sphere of Chthonic Darkness. He sees that he can create a 100sf medium-quality frame for 100,000gp, which meets the material cost of the ritual.

When the ritual is complete, the caster designates a sapient recipient by touch to guide the transition. The caster can designate himself as the recipient if desired. The recipient is responsible for paying the component cost of the ritual, a responsibility which presents him with a terrible dilemma: *consonant transit’*s entire component cost can be paid off if the recipient willingly sacrifices his own child by blood. (Recipients transiting to the Chthonic Darkness can sacrifice themselves instead of their child.) The sacrificed victim’s soul is then used to briefly bind the spheres, after which its residue dissipates into the interstices of the Cosmos and is lost even to the gods. If a familial blood sacrifice is not acceptable (or available), the component cost can be paid with arcane power, divine power, fragments of the Tablet of Destiny, and other sources.

One the sacrifice or expenditure is made, the transit takes place. The recipient will transit to the new sphere, along with whichever willing creatures within the frame he desires to bring. All carried and worn equipment is brought along in transit. Creatures who choose not to come (or who the recipient chooses not to bring) remain behind with their belongings.

At the moment of transit, the recipient has some control over the point of arrival. The amount of control is determined by the quality of the frame. A high-quality frame allows the recipient to select any unwarded destination on the target sphere. A medium-quality frame allows the recipient to select one of several possible destination offered by the Judge (e.g., in a dense fog in a forest, in a cavern below ground). A low-qualify frame offers no choice; the Judge selects the destination. Regardless of frame quality, the selected destination must be devoid of living creatures.

After transit, the frame will appear at the destination, but its appearance, form, and nature might be transformed by the transit to the new sphere. For instance, transit to the sphere of Chthonic Darkness might cause the frame to appear as a blood-stained altar while transit to the Empyrean Heaven might cause the frame to appear as incorporeal lines of light.

The recipient also has some control over the amount of time before the return occurs, also determined by the quality of the transit frame. A high-quality frame allows the recipient to determine the precise moment of return, and trigger it at will at an earlier time. A medium-quality frame allows the recipient to select the day of return, but the exact moment during the day will be random. A low-quality frame offers no choice; the return will happen at some point during the next 1d100 years. Fortunately, the recipient knows precisely when return will occur, even if he did not precisely select the moment.

Any creature, within the frame, willing or not, at the instant of return will transit back to the originating sphere to the location of initial departure.

A *consonant travel* ritual cannot be **dispelled**. However, a *wish* or *miracle* could be used to end the ritual and either immediately return or prevent the return of the travelers.

###### Consume Power

Arcane 8 , Divine 8 Type: protection, ritual, transmogrification

Range: special Duration: instantaneous

This ritual can only be cast in a place of power such as a an aerie of elemental air, pinnacle of good, etc. When it is complete, the ritual permanently drains the ambient power from the entire place and diverts it into the caster. The effect that the caster experiences from consuming these magical energies depends on the type and power of the place.

On the table below, roll 1d4 for a minor place of power; roll 1d4 then 1d8 for a major place of power; and roll 1d4, 1d8, and then 1d12 for a supreme place of power. (From time to time a particularly bold or desperate spellcaster has cast *consume power* while visiting another sphere of existence, such as the empyrean heaven or elemental sphere of fire. In such cases, the caster rolls 1d8, 1d12, and 1d12+4.) Apply the effects in the order rolled. All effects, good and ill, are cumulative, permanent, and irreversible save by ritual magic.

###### Harvest\*

Divine 7 Type: healing, ritual, transmogrification

Range: 12 milesDuration: 12 months

This ritual enables the caster to channel divine energy into the land around him, blessing it with fertile soil and bountiful harvests. *Harvest* increases the land value of all territory within 12 miles (1 24-mile hex or 500 square miles) by 2gp per peasant family for the next 12 months. See Collecting Revenue in the **Domains and Realms** section for details on land value.

*Ravage*, the reverse of *harvest*, decreases the land value of all territory within 12 miles by 2gp per peasant family for the next 12 months. *Ravage* can be undone by a successful *remove curse* cast by a spellcaster of greater level than the caster or by a *harvest* spell.

###### Emissary

Arcane 8 Type: ritual, summoning

Range: special Duration: special

This ritual reaches across the infinite horizons of the Cosmos to summon an emissary from another sphere of existence. The connection across the spheres can only be made at a major or supreme place of power, and the summoned emissary will always appear in a random location within the place. The ritual usually, but not always, selects an emissary that was about to die in his home sphere.

The emissary will be a 9th level character with exceptional attributes generated by rolling 5d6 for each and keeping the best 3d6. (Some can have guaranteed attributes.) The emissary can progress rapidly in power, automatically gaining a +50% bonus on any earned XP. The Judge can choose the race, class, origin, equipment, and powers of the emissary or roll 1d10 on the table below.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Die Roll | Race and Class |
| 1 | A **Mage** with strange golden skin and slitted pupils in red robes arrives by arcane portal. He has INT 18 but suffers from the Heart and Lung Damage permanent wound. |
| 2 | An **Elven Nightblade** with a 7HD panther henchman step out of the shadows. The nightblade has Beast Friendship and Fighting Style Specialization (Dual Weapons). Unlike most elves, he has black skin and white hair. |
| 3 | A **Paladin** wanders in from the mist. He is wearing a surcoat emblazoned with a dragon and carrying a *vorpal sword.* He claims he found the sword inside a rock or in a lake; the story isn’t consistent. He has CHA 18, Command, and Leadership. |
| 4 | A **Thief** with golden teeth and seafarer’s clothes splashes down. He is a master mariner (3 ranks of Seafaring) who carries a slender short sword and a brace of wheellock pistols with smoke-powder. See *Guns of War* p. XX. |
| 5 | A **Fighter** stumbles forward, bleeding from his heel but otherwise unharmed. He wears archaic Nicean plate armor and carries a spear, shield, and short sword. He is protected by *permanent deflect ordinary weapons*. |
| 6 | A **Zaharan Ruinguard** with pale skin and colorless eyes manifests out of a chaotic portal. His CON is capped at 7 but he carries a two-handed sword +3 that grants him *necromantic potence, ogre strength, striking*,and *swift sword* as permanent effects. Any creatures slain by the sword cannot be raised from the dead. If the Ruinguard is slain, the sword laughs and vanishes. |
| 7 | A **Terran Cosmonaut** emerges from a wrecked space capsule bearing a strange red, white, and blue insignia. His space capsule is filled with mysterious techno-artifacts. See *Barbarian Conquerors of Kanahu* p. XX. |
| 8 | A **Terran Starman** appears in a wrecked escape pod labeled NCC-17…. Roll 1d4 for branch: 1 – Command, 2 – Engineering, 3 – Medical, 4 – Science. His escape pod is filled with strange techno-tools. See *BCK*, p. XX. |
| 9 | A **Nephil**, gray-skinned and bug-eyed, enters through a strange iris-like portal. It carries weird alien artifacts; roll for 1d2 weapons and 1d4 devices on Visitor Horde tables. See *BCK*, p. XX. |
| 10 | An **Orc Shaman** of caster level 14 arrives through a dark portal of burning green flame. He keeps querying where the rest of the Horde has gone. See *Axioms Issue 2,* p. XX. |

Having been summoned without warning to another sphere of existence, the emissary is often quite confused as to where or when he is. However, the ritual guarantees that the emissary will be favorably disposed towards the caster, at least initially. The emissary counts as **bewitched**(as the spell *bewitch* *humanoid* spell) until he succeeds on a saving throw to shake off the effect. The emissary will inexplicably be able to speak the primary language of the caster, although from the emissary’s perspective the caster speaks *his* language.

An emissarycan only be **dispelled** by the original caster or by another caster of higher level. If the effect is dispelled, the *emissary* is immediately returned to his sphere of existence. Some emissaries may actively seek to have the effect dispelled while others might wish to avoid it (Judge’s discretion).

###### Flying Fortress

Arcane 9 Type: movement, ritual

Range: touch Duration: permanent

This ritual imbues a target structure or vessel worth up to 75,000gp with the power of flight. As soon as the ritual is cast, the newly-enchanted *flying fortress* ascends at a rate of 20’ per round until it reaches an altitude of 100’ above the ground. Thereafter, the *flying fortress* can be piloted through the air with a combat speed of 20’ per round, an encounter speed of 60’ per turn, and an expedition speed of 24 miles per day, moving in any direction with a maximum elevation of 30,000’ above sea level and a minimum elevation of 100’ above the ground.

The *flying fortress* is piloted from its seat of power. The seat of power can be a cathedra, chair, recliner, throne, stool, or any other piece of furniture affixed to the *flying fortress* and large enough to seat a man-sized creature. The seat of power is decided by the caster when the ritual is cast. The seat of power is not necessarily ornate, but it is usually designed to be as comfortable and sturdy as possible. Piloting the *flying fortress* from the seat of power is a strenuous activity which requires stationary concentration by a sapient creature of at least 9 HD. (Note that if enough high-level pilots are available, the seat of power can be occupied for 24 hours per day, enabling up to 72 miles of travel.) If the seat of power is unoccupied or destroyed, the *flying fortress* remains stationary if at an elevation of 1,000’ or less; otherwise it drifts in the direction of the prevailing wind. A destroyed seat of power can be repaired by an 11th level or higher caster as a magic research project with a 5,000gp component, material, and research cost.

From time to time, the occupants of a *flying fortress* have been known to attempt to drop or fling ballista, catapult or trebuchet stones onto points on the surface. If the target point is within the ordinary range for a war machine (usually 600’ – 1,500’), resolve such attacks as missile attacks with artillery (p. XX) against the target point’s AC. Beyond that range, treat the attack as if it were a missile attack with artillery that scattered. Roll 1d12 to determine the direction to a new impact point, applied as a clock direction from the original impact point (such that 6’o’clock points towards the *flying fortress*). The new impact point is 3d6 feet away per 250’ of range.

EXAMPLE: The occupants of a *flying fortress* drop a 180 lbs trebuchet stone onto the throne room of the imperial palace at Aura. The target point is 10,000’ directly below the *flying fortress*. Because 10,000’ exceeds the range of a heavy trebuchet, the stone automatically scatters by 3d6 x 40’ in a random clock direction. Tragically it lands in the public baths, killing hundreds…

A *flying fortress* cannot be **dispelled,** even by *wish* or *miracle*,as long as its seat of power is intact. However, if the seat of power is destroyed, the *flying fortress* can be dispelled by the original caster or another caster of higher level than the original caster. If the ritual is dispelled, the *flying fortress* crashes to the ground immediately. The structure or vessel takes 1 shp per 10’ fallen, while all creatures in the structure or vessel suffer 20d6 bludgeoning damage, or half that on a successful Blast save.

###### Magic Mushrooms

Divine 7 Type: ritual, transmogrification

Range: 12 milesDuration: 12 months

This ritual magically mutates all of the mushroom farms within 12 miles (1 24-mile hex or 500 square miles). The caster can choose to apply one vagary of mycocultural mutation to the domain or domains within range. The domain ruler cannot stop the vagary from affecting his mushroom crops, but he can avoid the effects by halting further farming until the duration expires. If this occurs, the land revenue of every piltgarin family drops to 0 until the end of the duration. See ***By This Axe***p. XX – XX for details on the vagaries of mycocultural mutation.

The *magic mushrooms* ritual can be **dispelled** by either the caster or a higher-level spellcaster. If not dispelled, the effects of the ritual last for 12 months.

###### Miracle

Divine 9 Type: ritual

Range: unlimited Duration: see below

*Miracle* is the most potent dweomer that any divine caster can perform. Like its arcane counterpart, *wish*, it can accomplish effects beyond the reach of ordinary magic. Some examples of what a *miracle* can accomplish include:

* Create a blast of fire, cloud of poison, or other effect that deals 1d6 extraordinary damage to up to 960 creatures in a 25,000 square foot area of effect with no saving throw — enough to destroy 8 companies, 2 battalions, or 1/2 brigade of ordinary troops.
* Instantaneously create magical construct(s) or magic item(s) with a total base cost of up to 200,000gp.
* Crossbreed any two creatures in line of sight. Unwilling creatures can make a Spells saving throw to resist the effect.
* Destroy a magic item worth up to 200,000gp base cost that was created by or is aligned with the god’s enemies.
* **Dispel** any other spell, heal any disease, or remove any curse, by any source.
* Eliminate any and all existing side effects from tampering with mortality in one creature.
* Instantaneously end another ritual spell. Any ritual spell can be ended except where otherwise noted in its entry.
* Instantaneously grant a class proficiency or class power to a named creature, at the cost of also giving it a side effect from the Tampering with Mortality table.
* Heal up to 1,920 creatures in line of sight of 1d6 damage.
* Instantaneously raise one of a named creature’s ability scores to 18, at the cost of it suffering a side effect from Tampering with Mortality table.
* Restore 60 slain creatures to life as if by *restore life and limb*.
* Slay a named creature or creature in line of sight. The creature can make a Death saving throw to resist the effect.
* Instantaneously transfer up to 600,000gp of precious metals, jewelry, merchandise, and/or livestock to the caster’s possession. The caster cannot specify specific items nor specific sources. The treasure is always sourced from myriad locations around the world, minimizing the chance that any prior possessors notice an absence.
* Instantaneously undo the effects of one battle turn in a battle.

Unlike *wish*, however, *miracles*are fulfilled indirectly, via the intercessory power of the caster’s deity, and successful fulfillment of the *miracle* is contingent on the approval of the deity rather than on the precise wording used. *Miracles*which do not advance the agenda of the deity will invariably go unfulfilled, and unless the *miracle*is obviously self-sacrificing on the part of the divine caster, the deity will subject him to a *quest*when the *miracle*is granted. A *miracle*’s component cost can only be paid for with divine power (p. XX).

###### Palace of Sulaimon

Arcane 8 Type: ritual, summoning

Range: 10’ Duration: 1 day

The ritual summoners 64 hafari (genies of elemental earth) to serve the caster for one day and night (24 hours total) in the construction of a structure. During this time, the hafari will collectively cast 192 of each of the following spells:

* C*reate objects*, conjuring 1,920 st. of goods by master craftsmen worth up to 192,000gp;
* *Earth’s movement*, permitting a total of 1,440,000,000 cubic feet of earthen construction;
* E*arth’s mire* or *earth’s hardening,* transforming a total of 5,760,000 cubic feet of earth into hard rock;
* *Perpetual figment*, weaving illusions covering 12,288,000 in cubic feet, all including visual, auditory, olfactory, and thermal components; and
* *Wall of stone,* creating a total of 96,000gp of stone construction or 960,000gp of decorative re-surfacing.

The typical means by which the *palace* is constructed is for the hafari to use *wall of stone* to create stone molds. The hafari then use *earths’ mire* to transform the nearby earth and rock into mud, and use *earth’s movement* to move the mud into the stone molds. The mud is then hardened with *earth’s hardening,* and the *walls of stone* dispelled to reveal concrete-like stone. The concrete can instead be re-surfaced with decorative *walls of stone* if desired*. Perpetual figments* can be used to decorate the *palace* in almost any conceivable fashion, while *create permanent soft objects* can be used to create carpets, furniture, and tapestries for the new domicile.

The hafari will use these powers to create whatever structure(s) the caster dictates. However, they are only begrudgingly loyal, and if commanded to make ugly, unstable, or impossible structures, they will gleefully comply. To ensure that the construction project is properly constructed, the caster must either be an engineer, or have an engineer at hand to supervise it. A character does not gain XP from a structure constructed using this spell.

Because it actually represents hundreds of castings, a *palace of Sulaimon* cannot be **dispelled**. Specific *objects*, *perpetual figments*, or *walls of stone* can be dispelled by ordinary means, though walls made by moving mud into molds via *earth’s movement* cannot be dispelled (being wholly mundane in nature if not construction).” A *wish* or *miracle* could destroy the entire structure, however.

It is said that Sulaimon, the sorcerer-king who founded the city of Alakyrum, used this mighty ritual to construct his opulent palace in a single night. So glorious was Sulaimon’s palace that it was named one of the seven wonders of the known world. Tragically, the palace was destroyed by the Emperor’s Talons during the Auran conquest of Opelenea.

###### Permanency

Arcane 8, Divine 8 Type: ritual

Range: 15’ Duration: permanent

This ritual makes a particular spell effect permanent. Spells can be made permanent on creatures, items, or areas. Creatures might receive permanent *discern magic, discern evil, flight, giant strength,* and *invulnerability to evil*. Items might be enchanted with permanent *bane-rune, sharpness,* or *striking.* Areas might be imbued with permanent *illumination, spellwarded zone,* or *wall of force.* This is not an exclusive list, and other spells can also be made permanent. However, *permanency* cannot make permanent any spell which has an instantaneous duration, any spell which causes the target of the spell to make a saving throw, or any ritual spell. Divine spells can only be made permanent with the permission of the deity (Judge’s discretion). The Judge can also declare that the *permanency* will not work with any other specific spell that he believes damages game balance.

An area can receive any number of *permanency* spells. An item can receive up to five *permanency* spells, at increasing risk. There is a cumulative 20% chance of failure for each *permanency* after the first, and if the *permanency* fails, it destroys the item completely. A creature can benefit from one *permanency* without risk. If the creature receives further permanency spells, it will begin to suffer side effects. For each additional effect, roll on the Tampering with Mortality table at -1 per additional *permanency*, in addition to other modifiers, and no bonus from caster level.

A *permanency* spell lasts until it is successfully **dispelled** by either the caster or a higher-level spellcaster. When the *permanency* is dispelled, the other spell effect vanishes immediately. Using a permanency to bind a spell to an item is not the same as creating a magic item, which uses a different process. True magic items cannot be dispelled, making them far more durable than items which have merely had spells permanently placed upon them.

###### Plague

Arcane 9 Type: death, ritual

Range: unlimited Duration: 1 month per level

This ritual creates a terrible pestilence that devastates the local population. The *plague* initially targets one 6-mile hex of a domain. The caster must have either visited the target domain, or personally met the ruler of the target domain, in order to target it. Each month, the *plague* spreads to affect each 6-mile hex adjacent to the hexes already affected. Each hex affected by the *plague*loses 1d10! families for every 100 families each month. A hex can only be affected by *plague* if it is settled with at least 100 families.

EXAMPLE: A 1-hex barony with a population of 700 families is subject to a *plague* cast by a 14th level mage. Each month it loses 7d10! families. After 14 months, the barony will have lost 98d10! families. In addition, the *plague* will have spread to many other hexes.

A *plague*also devastates the morale of affected domains. When a *plague* first affects a domain, the domain’s base morale score is immediately reduced by 2 points. Every three months that the *plague* continues thereafter, the domain’s base morale score is reduced by another point. The domain’s morale recovers at a rate of 1 point per month once the *plague* ends.

A *plague* ends if the caster dies or if it has no place to spread (either because it has killed all of the population or there are no settled hexes nearby). Otherwise, it can be ended only by *miracle, wish,* or the expiration of the duration. It cannot be **dispelled**.

###### Ranine Rain

Arcane 7 , Divine 7 Type: ritual, summoning

Range: unlimited Duration: 1 month

This ritual unleashes a supernatural meteorological phenomena commonly called a rain of frogs. The *ranine rain*will affect one domain with an area of up to 16 6-mile hexes (or 1 24-mile hex). Though the ritual has unlimited range, the caster must have either visited the target domain, or personally met the ruler of the target domain. Once the ritual is complete, the hex becomes subject to a set of new weather conditions, “Slimy” and “Foggy,” described below.

**Slimy:** This condition replaces the Drizzly condition. During Slimy conditions, thousands of tiny tadpoles continuously rain down from the sky throughout the day. The tadpoles are too small to cause harm, but being hit by them is disgusting. Creatures in the open during Slimy conditions must make a Blast saving throw each turn. If the save succeeds, the creature is unaffected that turn. If the save fails, the creature becomes **queasy** from disgust for one turn. If the save fails on an unmodified 1, the creature accidentally gets tadpoles in its mouth or nose, and begins **vomiting** for one turn.

**Froggy:** This condition replaces the Rainy condition. During Froggy conditions, thousands of frogs shower down from the heavens throughout the day. Most of the frogs die messily when they hit the ground, but those fortunate enough to fall in soft ground, mud, or water survive and begin to hop around. The falling frogs reduce maximum visibility distance to 60’, and all creatures outdoors suffer a -1 penalty to avoid surprise due to the croaking, hopping, and spattering frogs. Land Surveying, Navigation, Searching, and Tracking proficiency throws also suffer a -4 penalty, but Survival proficiency throws to hunt automatically succeed – it's frog legs for dinner, boys! Wandering monsters encountered during Froggy conditions have a 50% chance to be giant frogs, regardless of terrain. Finally, creatures in the open during Froggy conditions must make a Blast saving throw each turn. If the save succeeds, the creature is unaffected that turn. If the save fails, the creature is struck by a frog for 1d4 mundane bludgeoning damage. If the save fails on a natural 1, the creature accidentally swallows a frog. Such unlucky fools must make a successful Death save or be slain by choking or poison.

The effects of the *ranine rain* over time can be quite damaging to the domain. The domain’s base morale score is reduced by 1 point as soon as a Slimy or Froggy day occurs, and by an additional point for every five days of Slimy or Froggy conditions thereafter. (The domain’s morale recovers at a rate of 1 point per month once the *ranine rain* ends.) The families residing in the hex cannot safely work during Froggy conditions. If permitted to shelter at home, domain revenue is reduced by 3% each day of Froggy conditions. If forced to work, the peasants lose 1d10! families per 100 families in the domain. At the end of the month, if the number of Froggy days exceeds twice the land value, the land value is reduced by 1 from environmental damage. A *ranine rain* ends if the caster dies. Otherwise, it can be ended only by *miracle, wish,* or the expiration of the duration. It cannot be **dispelled**.

###### Resurrection\*

Divine 8 Type: healing, ritual

Range: touchDuration: instantaneous

This ritual functions like *restore life and limb*, except that upon completion of the spell, the recipient is immediately restored to full hit points, vigor, and health, with no side effects or lingering exhaustion. Any existing permanent wounds or side effects are removed. The condition of the recipient’s remains is not a factor. So long as some small portion of the recipient’s body still exists, it can be *resurrected*. However, the recipient must not have died before the caster was born and must not have died of old age.

*Destruction,* the reverse of *resurrection*, causes the living creature touched by the caster to die immediately and fall to dust with no saving throw. A creature slain by *destruction* cannot be restored to life by any means short of *miracle* or *wish*.

###### Seven-League Stride

Arcane 7, Divine 7 Type: movement, ritual

Range: touch Duration: see below

When this ritual is cast, the spellcaster designates a recipient and a destination. The destination must be known to the caster, either from an accurate map, first-hand visit, *scrying,* etc. The recipient can travel towards the destination at great speed, traversing seven leagues (21 miles) with every stride while carrying up to its full encumbrance load.

Though very fast, the journey is not instantaneous. To calculate the number of rounds required for the trip, divide the distance in miles to the designated location by 210. For instance, if the designated location is 1,680 miles away, the recipient will arrive 8 minutes after it sets out.

The recipient only dimly perceives its surroundings during its journey, as the terrain features pass by in a blur of speed, and thus might lose his way. The recipient must make a proficiency throw to avoid getting lost (affected normally by the terrain at the designated location). If the throw fails, each point by which the throw was missed increases the actual time passed by 25%.

A *seven-league stride* cannot be **dispelled**.

###### Shadeveil

Arcane: 9                          Type: illusion, enchantment, transmogrification, ritual

Range: 12 miles               Duration: Special

*Shadeveil* is an old, potent ritual first invoked by the ancient elves to protect their woodland realms from the encroachment of man and dwarf. A more sinister, warped version of the ritual was said to be perfected by the ancient Zaharans during their rise to power, though it is possible some Chthonic cult of elvenkind is the true culprit and the *shadeveil* is their final legacy before being butchered by the surgent Thrassians.

The *shadeveil* ritual infuses a target domain with potent dweomers. All of the target domain’s territory must be in range of the spell, and the domain cannot occupy more than one 24-mile hex. The caster decides which aspect of the ritual to invoke at the time of casting, either cloaking the area in a *secret veil* or shrouding it in a *living nightmare*.

A *secret veil*draws upon the power of illusion and enchantment to prevent unwanted intrusion into a protected domain and discourages potential interlopers and invaders. A domain under this version of the spell gains the following:

* The entire domain is infused with illusions of misdirection and concealment. Creatures that enter the domain are automatically affected by these illusions with no saving throw. Affected creatures can only discern what the caster wishes them to see – a town can look like a grove of trees, a grassy expanse can be a field of lava, or a mountain path an impenetrable mass of sticky webs. The magical misdirection and shifting, illusory landscapes make it impossible for affected creatures to succeed on Mapping, Land Surveying, and Navigation proficiency throws. Affected creatures’ minds will rationalize moving through these landscapes, avoiding obstacles and impassible terrain, without disturbing the illusion.
* Sapient creatures traveling in the domain can find themselves unknowingly diverted to the nearest exist. Each creature must make a Spells saving throw every hour. (If the creatures are traveling as a unit, roll once for the unit as a whole using the unit leader’s throw.) If the save fails, the creature(s) or unit move in a straight line to the closest possible point of exit to the area of the spell. The affected creature(s) will believe they have maintained their desired direction.
* For each caster level, one structure, such as a tower, bridge, or statue, can be cloaked in *invisibility*. However, the caster and any creatures he designates can see the invisible structures normally.
* For each caster level, a single path, trail, road, or waterway can be excluded from the spell if the caster desires. This permits “safe” travel along these routes.
* For one hour per day, the caster or a designated guardian (see below) can use an ordinary mirror, crystal ball, pool, or similar reflective surface to *scry* (as the spell) anywhere within the spell’s area.

A *living nightmare* does the following:

* The domain is shrouded in a dismal and foreboding shadowscape. Creatures that enter the affected area are automatically affected by the shadowscape with no saving throw. Affected creatures reduce their movement by half (on top of any terrain modifiers) and reduce their visibility distance to just 30’. The magical misdirection combined with the constantly grasping, tripping, twisting landscape makes it impossible for affected creatures to succeed on Mapping, Land Surveying, and Navigation proficiency throws.
* The domain is abandoned, becoming unsettled, with all inhabitants departing over a period of 1d6 months. After 12 months, the entire domain becomes a *shadowed sinkhole of evil*.
* All animals in the domain attempt to flee. Those that are unable to flee die within 1d12 months (and might thereafter rise as undead). All normal plants slowly wither and die over 1d12 months. The dead remnants then begin to horrifically warp into bleak, thorny, and misshapen forms.
* Sapient creatures traveling in the domain can find themselves unknowingly diverted away from the nearest exit. Each creature must make a Spells saving throw every hour. (If the creatures are traveling as a unit, roll once for the unit as a whole using the unit leader’s throw.) If the save fails, the creature(s) or unit spends the hour wandering in circles with no sense of direction.
* A sense of hopelessness, fear, and misery affects the minds of those within. Whether traveling or stationary, each sapient creature in the domain must make another Spells saving throw every hour. If the save fails, the creature suffers one of the following effects (roll 1d12):
  + 1-2: The creature suffers a living nightmare in which it is “killed.” The creature must make a Death saving throw. If the save succeeds, it becomes **slumbering** for 1d12 rounds. If the save fails, it becomes **slumbering** for 1d12 hours.
  + 3-4: The creature experiences a traumatic event, either a real vision from its past or an imagined event that plays into its worst dread. Grief and misery root it to the spot, leaving it **cowering** for 1d10 turns.
  + 5-6: The creature experiences a waking dream in which it is beset by enemies or terrible beasts. The creature becomes **infuriated** and immediately attacks the closest sapient creature (usually an ally) and continues to do so for 1d10 rounds before coming to its senses.
  + 7-8: The creature encounters one of its worst fears, causing it to become **frightened** for 1d10 turns. The creature will run in a random direction, believing itself to be relentlessly “pursued” by the illusion.
  + 9-10: A wave of exhaustion overcomes the creature. The creature must make a Death saving throw. If the save succeeds, the creature becomes **fatigued** for 1d6 turns. If the save fails, the creature is **slumbering** for 1d10 hours.
  + 11-12: A random encounter appropriate to the terrain is triggered. Combat ensues but the creatures are illusory, disappearing when hit. Damage sustained, however, remains.
* Sapient creatures slain in the domain become haunts (see ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual***).

When the ritual is cast, the caster can decide who, aside from himself, will be unaffected by the ritual in either form. This decision is permanent for the duration of the ritual. If the caster chooses, he can craft special talismans which ward off the ritual’s effects on whichever creatures carry them. Crafting a *shadeveil* talisman has a material cost, component cost, and research cost of 500gp.

Once complete, the ritual lasts for 12 months. However, the caster can extend the ritual duration by linking the *shadeveil* with the life force of a living creature.

In the case of a *secret veil,* the caster can designate a willing living creature to be the guardian of the veil. Thereafter, as long as the guardian remains alive and stays within the domain, the ritual’s duration will remain in effect perpetually. In the days of old, it was common for long-lived creatures such as sphinxes, treeherders, and unicorns to be chosen as guardians.

In the case of a *living nightmare,* the caster can designate a living creature to become the cursed victim of the nightmare. The creature does not have to be willing, but it must be magically put to sleep (usually by *slumber* or *deep slumber*) in order to become the cursed victim. Once asleep, the victim enters into a perpetual nightmare that slowly consumes their soul. Each year that it slumbers, the victim ages 1d10 years. If the creature dies, it becomes a specter doomed to haunt (and sustain) the domain.

A *shadeveil* can be **dispelled** by a *remove curse* spell by a higher level spellcaster than the creator of the ritual. Alternatively, the *shadeveil* can be dispelled by removing or killing the guardian of the *secret veil*, waking up the victim of the *living nightmare,* or destroying the specter the victim has become. A *wish* or *miracle* could also end the ritual.

###### Spawn of the Deep

Arcane 7, Divine 7 Type: ritual, summoning

Range: 480’ Duration: 1 day

This ritual summons one of the most terrible archfiends of Lammala -- Cthaylor of the Deep – from the watery depths. It can only be performed within range of a well of elemental water that is connected to or in the ocean. When the ritual is complete, dread Cthaylor arises from the well of elemental water to serve the caster.

Sages who have studied the lore of Cthaylor – and they are few – believe that she was once a powerful elven enchantress in Southern Argollë, seduced by wicked influences of Lammala and transformed into a cacodemon by ritual magic. Whatever her origins, Cthaylor stands 36’ tall and weighs over 40,000 lbs. Her form, though humanoid, is bloated to colossal size, with skin a loathsome, rubbery texture the color of seaweed. Cthaylor’s hands and feet terminate in claw-like nails, each one the size and color of a narwhal horn. From her back arise a pair of great fins, almost resembling vestigial wings. In lieu of hair, Cthaylor’s brow is crowned with a writhing mass of pale tentacles, each one undulating with a life of its own as if to some unheard rhythm. But what is most horrific of all is the creature’s face: for dread Cthaylor carries the visage of fair-eyed elven woman of surpassing beaty and grace, a beauty transformed into an abomination by the rest of the creature’s body. From her lavish lips she utters a constant trilling song; to those who can speak Ancient Zaharan, her words are recognizable as litanies of remorse for lost love, but to others it is the ghastly sound of damnation.

Dread Cthaylor acts on her own initiative. As a servant of Chaos, she will assist the caster in the pursuit of fell deeds that serve to bring destruction and ruin into the world. She will not pursue tasks that she deems beneath her majesty, nor courses of action that are motivated by benevolence or compassion or that work towards Lawful or even Neutral ends. Any such requests will cause Cthaylor to return to the water depths. Otherwise, Cthaylor will serve until destroyed or **dispelled** by a caster of higher level than the summoner or until a full day has elapsed.

**Cthaylor of the Deep:** Archfiend; CON 18; Size Colossal (16,000 st), AC 12, Spd 40’/120’ or 60’/180’ (swim), HD 24\*\*\*\*\*\*\*, hp 200, #AT 6 (2 claws, 4 tentacles -9+) or 1 (trample -9+), Dmg 3d10/3d10/1d10/1d10/1d10/1d10 or 9d10, Save F24, ML +3, AL C, XP 23,000; Special Abilities: *capsizing wave* (1/turn), enthralling song (as harpy), immunity (necrotic damage, poisonous damage, all mundane damage), massive size, spellcasting, *water breathing* (at will), *telepathy* (at will); Spells per day 5 1st, 5 2nd, 5 3rd, 5 4th, 5 5th, 5 6th ; Caster Level 20th; Repertoire: 1st – *conjure cacodemon spawn, counterspell, desiccate, discern magic, ice floe;* 2nd – *conjure imp, discern invisible, rain of vitriol, shrouding fog, swimming;* 3 – *cone of frost, dispel magic, ice sheet, incite madness, infuriate crowd*; 4th -  *cloud of poison, scry, sunder structure, wall of frost, weave water;* 5th – *carnage, conjure dybbuk, conjure supreme elemental, ice storm, summon weather, teleportation;* 6th – *anti-magic sphere, conjure fiend, control weather, level water, locate place of power*

**Designer’s Note:** While the ritual itself is specific to Cthaylor, the Judge’s campaign world can of course include similar rituals that summon other archfiends of his own design.

###### Undead Legion

Arcane 9 Type: death, ritual

Range: touch Duration: permanent

This ritual can only be cast in a place of death (such as a cemetery, catacomb, or battleground). When it is complete, the spellcaster raises an *undead legion*under his command from the corpses and skeletons residing therein. The *undead legion*will include a number of Hit Dice of skeletons or zombies equal to 400 times caster level, subject to the maximum number of dead in his area. Whether the *undead legion*consists of skeletons or zombies will depend on the state of the corpses in the surrounding area. Animated skeletons have Hit Dice equal to the number the monster had in life, excluding class levels; for skeletons of humans or demi-humans, this means one Hit Die, regardless of the class level of the deceased. Zombies have one more Hit Die than the monster had in life.

EXAMPLE: Sebek, a 14th level mage, travels to the catacombs of Old Zahar, in order to perform the *undead legion*ritual. After 9 weeks, his Magic Research throw succeeds, so he animates 5,600 Hit Dice of undead. Since the Old Zaharans mummified the dead, the corpses are relatively intact and become zombies. Sebek’s *undead legion*consists of 2,800 2 HD human zombies.

The caster can give verbal orders to the members of the *undead legion* when they rise and thereafter anytime they are in line of sight on his initiative. Complex or extensive orders require the caster to expend an action in lieu of moving, but simple orders (“protect me!”) do not require an action. Orders can be given in any language the caster speaks. The animated undead will mindlessly obey whatever orders they are given to the best of their (limited) ability. They cannot accomplish tasks that require abstract thought or higher reasoning. If they complete all of their orders, or for whatever reason are physically unable to obey their orders, the undead will simply remain stationary until they receive new orders. The undead act on their own initiative each round.

The members of the*undead legion*remain animated until they are destroyed or **dispelled**. Note that if *undead legion*is cast in a **sinkhole of evil**, the spellcaster will calculate the spell effects as if he were one or more class levels higher than his actual level of experience. Rules for **sinkholes of evil** can be found in the ***ACKS II Judges Journal***.

###### Wish

Arcane 9 Type: ritual

Range: unlimited Duration: special

*Wish* is the mightiest spell that any arcane caster can perform. By simply speaking aloud, the caster can alter reality. This spell can accomplish unique effects that are otherwise impossible for mere mortals. Some examples of what a *wish* can do include:

* Create a blast of fire, cloud of poison, or other effect that deals 1d6 extraordinary damage to up to 1,920 creatures in a 50,000 square foot area of effect with no saving throw — enough to destroy 16 companies, 4 battalions, or 1 brigade of ordinary troops.
* Instantaneously create magical construct(s) or magic item(s) with a total base cost of up to 200,000gp.
* Crossbreed any two creatures in line of sight. (Unwilling creatures can make a Spells saving throw to resist the effect.)
* Destroy a magic item worth up to 200,000gp base cost that was created by arcane magic.
* **Dispel** any other spell, heal any disease, or remove any curse, by any source.
* Eliminate any and all existing side effects from tampering with mortality in one creature.
* Instantaneously end another ritual spell. Any ritual spell can be ended except where otherwise noted in its entry.
* Instantaneously grant a class proficiency or class power to a named creature, at the cost of also giving it a side effect from the Tampering with Mortality table.
* Heal up to 960 creatures in line of sight of 1d6 damage.
* Instantaneously raise one of a named creature’s ability scores to 18, at the cost of it suffering a side effect from the Tampering with Mortality table.
* Restore 30 slain creatures to life as if by *restore life and limb*.
* Slay a named creature or creature in line of sight. The creature can make a Death saving throw to resist the effect.
* Teleport up to 30 creatures within line of sight to any place in any sphere of existence without error.
* Instantaneously transfer up to 600,000gp of precious metals, jewelry, merchandise, and/or livestock to the caster’s possession. The caster cannot specify specific items nor specific sources. The treasure is always sourced from myriad locations around the world, minimizing the chance that any prior possessors notice an absence.
* Instantaneously undo the effects of one battle turn in a battle.

*Wishes* will be fulfilled according to the letter of the request, and the Judge can exercise some regulation of *wishes* based on this strict enforcement. Ultimately, the Judge will have to decide the limits of a *wish* spell.

###### Youthfulness

Divine 7 Type: healing, ritual

Range: touch Duration: instantaneous

This ritual restores the recipient touched to the prime of his life. His age is re-set to the first year of the adult category for his species and any and all aging penalties he has accrued are removed. Such a radical rejuvenation of the body can come with serious consequences. The recipient must roll 1d20 and 1d6 on the Tampering with Mortality table for his alignment and suffer the resulting side effect. This roll is modified only by the character’s WIL and age.

Those who would prefer to avoid the unpleasantries that come with tampering with mortality have another choice. If the caster conducts a sufficient amount of blood sacrificing (see p. XX) during the ritual, the recipient can avoid rolling on the Tampering with Mortality table entirely by bathing in the blood of the victims. The amount of divine power that must be supplied by blood sacrifice is equal to the recipient’s age multiplied by 100. This cost is in addition to the component cost of the ritual itself, which must be paid separately. For purposes of calculating the divine power, the recipient’s relationship to the sacrificial victim counts instead of the caster’s.

EXAMPLE: Akasha, a 12th level Zaharan ruinguard, has reached the age of 79. Faced with the prospect of oblivion or undeath, she seeks out the chthonic priest Xisuthros to perform the ritual of *youthfulness* upon her. When informed of the grave risks of such a ritual, she decides to resort to blood sacrifice. She will need (79 x 100) = 7,900 XP in blood sacrifice. She calculates that around 800 0th level virgins purchased in the flesh-market of Zahar should suffice for her bath of blood…

### Magic Experimentation

Magic experimentation is a rare practice. In the thousands of years since the arts of magic were first undertaken by mortals, countless spellcasters have penned formula and devised items. The majority of magic research entails following the formulas and methods lain down by the ancient masters, or perhaps re-engineering some device from a sample discovered in an old trove. Occasionally, ambitious researchers devise new spells or entirely new magic items, but this is rare. The risk of loss of components, materials, and — most of all — time, is simply too great to be countenanced by temples and towers of learning. Rarer still are those researchers who will push beyond the ordinary limits of magic and achieve great deeds of renown.

Anytime a researcher conducts a research project that requires a magic research throw, he can choose to engage in **magic experimentation**. By eschewing the ordinary parameters of practice and safety, experimenters can gain an **experimental advantage** such as speedier progress or superior insight. With luck, an experimenter may even achieve a **breakthrough**, resulting in a more powerful spell or item than expected. However, if the magic research fails, the experimenter will suffer a **mishap**. The experimental advantage gained, and the harm caused by a mishap, is determined by the experimenter’s **method of experimentation**.

###### Experimental Advantage

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Advantage** | **Effect of Advantage** |
| Haste | Doubles research rate |
| Efficiency | Doubles value of special components |
| Insight | Grants +2 bonus on research throw |
| Lore | Allows esoteric spells (1st – 2nd level) |

By performing an experiment, a researcher gains his choice of one or more advantages, choosing from **haste**, **efficiency**, **insight,** or **lore**. Haste doubles the research rate of the experimenter. Efficiency doubles the value of special components expended on the project. Insight grants a +2 bonus to the experimenter’s magic research throw. Lore allows the experimenter to enchant an esoteric spell of 1st or 2nd level into an activated or permanent item.

An experimenter can (but doesn’t have to) select the same advantage multiple times. If he does, the bonus is cumulative. Selecting haste or efficiency twice causes the research rate or component value to triple (x3), while selecting haste or efficiency three times causes the research rate or component value to quadruple (x4). Selecting lore twice allows up to 4th level esoteric spells or a bonus greater than +3 versus a particular monster type, and selecting lore three times allows up to 6th level esoteric spells to be enchanted or a bonus greater than +3 versus all monsters.

###### Method of Experimentation

When a spellcaster choose to experiment, he may choose from **conventional**, **pioneering**, or **radical** methods. Conventional experiments rely on the customary approaches of collegiate wizards, designed to create incremental gains with minimum risk. Examples would be slight changes to magical algorithms, minor adjustments to potion or scroll formula, and so on. Pioneering experiments seek significant advances at greater risk. A pioneering experiment might deploy new paradigms of magical theory or major changes to customary formulas and may draw on alternative traditions outside the spellcaster’s craft. Radical experiments risk catastrophe to accomplish the otherwise impossible. Radical experiments use highly dangerous and often forbidden practices, such as directly accessing extraplanar forces, binding demons, or blood magic.

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Method of**  **Experimentation** | **Experimental**  **Advantages** | **Result of Failed**  **Experiment** | **Minimum**  **Level** |
| Conventional | 1 Advantage | Minor Mishap | 5th |
| Pioneering | 2 Advantages | Major Mishap | 9th |
| Radical | 3 Advantages | Catastrophic Mishap | 11th |

Using conventional methods grants one experimental advantage, but triggers **minor mishaps** if the research fails. Using pioneering methods grants two experimental advantages, while triggering **major mishaps** if the research fails. Using radical methods grants three experimental advantages, but triggers **catastrophic mishaps** if the research fails. (Remember that an unmodified die roll of 1 – 3 is an automatic failure. Any spellcaster using experimental methods risks at least a 15% chance of a mishap!) An experimenter must reach the required minimum level shown before he can use that method of experimentation. (After all, a caster who has not mastered the basics of his art cannot hope to push the boundaries.)

A research assistant can directly aid an experimenter without having to meet the experiment’s minimum level. A research assistant working semi-independently cannot engage in magic experimentation.

###### Mishaps

When an experiment fails, the experimenter must roll 1d10 on whichever Mishap table is appropriate for the type of research he was attempting (e.g. creating a construct or researching a spell) and suffer the effect listed in the column matching the degree of mishap. Some of the results on the Mishap tables require that the spellcaster roll on other tables; these are either in the ***ACKS II Judges Journal***, or listed after the Mishaps tables.

Research assistants aiding an experiment can be affected by mishaps, but the danger is not as great as for the experimenter himself. If a minor mishap occurs, the assistants are unaffected. If a major mishap occurs, the assistants are each affected by the equivalent minor mishap. If a catastrophic mishap occurs, the assistants are each affected by the equivalent major mishap.

###### Breakthroughs

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Level of Breakthrough** | **Threshold of Success** | **Required Method** | **Min. Level** |
| Minor | Target Value Exceeded by 5+ | Any | 7th |
| Major | Target Value Exceeded by 10+ | Pioneering or Radical | 9th |
| Revolutionary | Target Value Exceeded by 20+ | Radical | 11th |

A breakthrough occurs when the experimenter’s magic research throw exceeds his target value by a particular threshold.

A **minor breakthrough** occurs when the target value is exceeded by 5+. A **major breakthrough** is achieved when the target value is exceeded by 10+. A **revolutionary breakthrough** is achieved when the target value is exceeded by 20+.

However, regardless of the throw, conventional experiments cannot achieve better than minor breakthroughs, while pioneering experiments cannot achieve better than major breakthroughs. Additionally, spellcasters must reach a certain minimum level before they are able to achieve certain levels of breakthrough. (Again, a caster who has not mastered the basics of his art cannot hope to push the boundaries.) The requirements to achieve a breakthrough are summarized on the Level of Breakthroughs table. When the magic throw results in a breakthrough exceeding that permitted by the caster’s level or method of experimentation, the highest level of breakthrough that would be permitted occurs instead.

The results of a breakthrough depends on the type of magical research and the level of the breakthrough. The Results of Breakthroughs table summarizes the benefits of various levels of breakthrough for different types of research.

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Type of Magical Research** | **Minor Breakthrough** | **Major Breakthrough** | **Revolutionary Breakthrough** |
| Creating Magic Items | Minor bonus effect | Notable bonus effect | Powerful bonus effect |
| Crossbreeding Creatures | 1 ability (roll 3d6) | 2 abilities (roll 2d10) | 3 abilities (roll 1d20) |
| Designing Construct | +2 HD maximum | +6 HD maximum | +12 HD maximum |
| Manufacturing Constructs | 1 ability (roll 3d6) | 2 abilities (roll 2d10) | 3 abilities (roll 1d20) |
| Performing Necromancy | 1 ability (roll 3d6) | 2 abilities (roll 2d10) | 3 abilities (roll 1d20) |
| Researching Spell/Ritual | +1/2 spell level | +1 spell level | +2 spell levels |
| Ritual Casting | +1/2 spell level | +1 spell level | +2 spell levels |

**Creating Magic Items**: The magic item unexpectedly gains additional powers as a result of the breakthrough. A minor breakthrough gives the item a minor bonus effect, such as a +1 bonus versus a particular monster type or additional spell effect(s) of lower level than its existing effects worth up to 50% of the item’s cost. A major breakthrough results provides the item with a notable bonus effect, such as a +2 bonus versus a particular monster type or additional spell effect(s) of similar level to its existing effects, worth up to the item’s cost. A revolutionary breakthrough results in the item acquiring a powerful bonus effect, such as a +3 bonus versus a particular monster type, or acquiring additional spell effect(s) of similar or even higher level worth up to twice the item’s cost.

Bonus effect types can have the same effect type as the item’s primary effect type, or a less expensive effect type (Judge’s discretion based on cost). The Judge may roll randomly to choose spell-like effect(s) (as per a spell scroll) or select them based on the context and history of the item. The bonus effects do not increase the cost of this project. The bonus effects are not part of the item’s formula, so researchers working from the item’s formula will not replicate the bonus effects. However, a researcher who uses the item as a sample can thereafter create a copy that does replicate the item’s bonus effects (at the full cost!).

EXAMPLE #1: Quintus has achieved a minor breakthrough while enchanting a **sword +2***.* The item gains a +1 bonus versus a particular monster type. Quintus has long warred against the beastmen of the Waste, so the Judge decides this hatred has imbued itself into the weapon, making it a **sword +2, +3 versus beastmen***.* For purposes of Quintus’s project, the **sword +2**retains its 15,000gp component, material, and research cost. The formula produced by Quintus’s research is also for a **sword +2**. However, Quintus could now use the sword as a sample for a new 25,000gp magic research project to create a **sword +2, +3 vs. beastmen***.*

EXAMPLE #2: Elaria has achieved a revolutionary breakthrough while enchanting a **ring of invisibility**. A **ring of invisibility**is built as a 3rd level spell available once per turn for a cost of 15,000gp. The revolutionary breakthrough grants additional spell effect(s) of 3rd level or higher, useable once per day or less frequently, costing up to 30,000gp. The **ring**is intended as a gift for Elaria’s friend Fogrimm to use while exploring dungeons, so the Judge decides that the **ring**also grants the wearer **inaudibility**and **shrinking**once per day. For purposes of Elaria’s research project, the *ring* retains its 15,000gp component, material, and research costs, and the project yields a formula for a **ring of invisibility**. However, Elaria could now use the ring as a sample to research the 45,000gp **ring of invisibility, inaudibility, and shrinking***.*

**Crossbreeding Creatures**: A breakthrough results in the crossbreed gaining special abilities that were not present in the progenitor creatures. Such abilities are the result of unexpected synergies between the two progenitors. A minor breakthrough provides the crossbreed with 1 special ability. A major breakthrough provides the crossbreed with 2 special abilities. A revolutionary breakthrough provides the crossbreed with 3 special abilities. Major and revolutionary breakthroughs tend to provide more powerful abilities. The Judge may select appropriate special abilities or have the player roll on the Unexpected Abilities table using the listed die. The additional special abilities do not increase the costs of creating the crossbreed. The unexpected abilities can be transmitted to new creatures in future crossbreeding if desired.

EXAMPLE: Artashumara has achieved a revolutionary breakthrough while crossbreeding a hellhound with a stegosaurus to create a hellish luposaurus (AC 6, Move 120’, HD 11, Attacks 1 tail or 1 trample, or fiery breath, Dmg 2d8/2d6/11d6, ML +1, detects invisibility 60’). He rolls 1d20 three times on the Unexpected Abilities table. His first roll is an 8, gaining a swallow attack. The Judge decides that when the luposaurus hits with its tail on a natural 19-20, it flings creatures smaller than itself into its maw. Artashumara’s second roll is a 4, a breath weapon. The hellish luposaurus already has a breath weapon, so he re-rolls and gets a 7, immunity. The Judge rules that the luposaurus is immune to fire, to correspond with its breath weapon. Artashumara’s third roll is an 18, petrification. The follow-on roll determines that the luposaurus petrifies creatures struck by its attacks. The Judge justifies this by saying that the creature’s extreme heat instantly petrifies living tissue. (Clearly the creature must enjoy eating calcified flesh, since it swallows its victims whole…).

**Designing Constructs**: Innovative design techniques and cutting-edge engineering allows the experimenter to exceed his normal design parameters. A minor breakthrough increases the HD limit by 2, a major breakthrough by 6, and a revolutionary breakthrough by 12. The breakthrough does not increase the material or research cost that the experimenter must pay to complete the design. The construct’s higher HD are part of the formula, and increase the material cost and research cost to actually manufacture the construct. However, the additional HD do not increase the level required to manufacture the construct.

EXAMPLE: Quintus achieves a revolutionary breakthrough while designing a 28\*\* HD construct. Quintus’s design will be for a construct of 40\*\* HD. The design still has a material cost and research cost of 66,000gp each. If Quintus or another researcher later manufactures the construct, the material cost and research cost will be 90,000gp each. Even though the construct is 40 HD, it can be manufactured from the formula by a 14th level caster (because it originally had 28 HD).

**Manufacturing Constructs**: Unexpected synergies during the construction process yield special abilities that were not present in the experimenter’s formula. A minor breakthrough provides the construct with 1 special ability, a major breakthrough provides 2 special abilities, and a revolutionary breakthrough provides 3 special abilities. Major and revolutionary breakthroughs tend to provide more powerful abilities. The Judge may select appropriate special abilities or have the player roll on the Unexpected Abilities table using the listed die. The additional special abilities do not increase the costs of manufacturing this construct. Future research working from this formula will not replicate the breakthrough. However, a researcher who uses the newly-manufactured construct as a sample can design a construct that replicates the construct’s special abilities.

EXAMPLE: Quintus is manufacturing a construct using the formula for a 20\* HD bronze golem. However, through experimentation, he has achieved a minor breakthrough. He rolls 3d6 once on the Unexpected Abilities table and gets a 9, indicating ongoing damage. The Judge determines that when the bronze golem hits, it seizes hold of its victim and can squeeze it each round for 3d10 more damage. Although the bronze golem is now 20\*\* HD, the manufacturing project still has a material cost and research cost of 45,000gp.

Quintus’s formula is still just for a 45,000gp research project to manufacture a 20\* HD bronze golem. However, Quintus or another researcher could use the newly-made bronze golem as a sample for a 50,000gp research project to design a 20\*\* HD bronze golem.

**Performing Necromancy**: The dark magic used in the experiment results in the undead gaining unexpected special abilities. Where the undead has the ability to reproduce (e.g. ghouls), this may result in the creation of an entirely new sub-type of undead in the world! A minor breakthrough provides the undead with 1 special ability. A major breakthrough provides the undead with 2 special abilities. A revolutionary breakthrough provides the undead with 3 special abilities. Major and revolutionary breakthroughs tend to provide more powerful abilities. The Judge may select appropriate special abilities or roll on the Unexpected Abilities table using the listed die. The additional special abilities do not increase the researcher’s costs of performing this necromancy. After completing the research, the researcher counts as familiar with the breakthrough undead, and can thereafter perform necromancy to deliberately create the undead.

EXAMPLE: Sargon is performing necromancy to transform a henchman into a 5+1\* HD mummy. Through experimentation, he has achieved a major breakthrough. He rolls 2d10 twice on the Unexpected Abilities table. The first roll is a 16, so the mummy is massive size. The result is a 10+2 HD mummy that deals 2d12 damage with its strike. The second roll is a 10, “Bonus Attack,” with a follow-on d6 result of 3. The mummy gains a bonus melee attack identical to the mummy’s primary attack. Since its primary attack has gained double damage (2d12), so does its bonus attack. Brutal! Sargon’s component, material, and research cost for this project is still only 15,000gp. In the future, Sargon can perform necromancy to create 10+2\*\* HD giant mummies, but the cost will be 30,000gp.

**Researching Spells**: When researching spells, breakthroughs increase the power of the spell without increasing its actual spell level. A minor breakthrough raises the spell’s power by 1/2 level (i.e. mid-way to the next level). A major breakthrough raises the spell’s power by 1 level. A revolutionary breakthrough raises the spell’s power by 2 levels. In this way, low level spells can be created which are as powerful as higher level spells. Once such a spell is created, other arcane casters can learn it from spellbooks and scrolls normally. Many of the most famous and popular spells were created in this way.For example, the 3rd level *fireball* was the result of a revolutionary breakthrough that resulted in a spell as powerful as the 5th level *ice storm*. It is up to the Judge to determine if a breakthrough spell counts as “common” thereafter in his campaign.

**Ritual Learning:** When learning rituals, breakthroughs increase the power of the ritual without increasing its actual ritual level. A minor breakthrough raises the ritual’s power by 1/2 level (i.e. mid-way to the next level). A major breakthrough raises the ritual’s power by 1 level. A revolutionary breakthrough raises the ritual’s power by 2 levels. *Miracle* and *wish* are examples of breakthroughs, being effectively 11th level in power. The formula produced by the successful completion of the project can thereafter be used by other researchers to learn the ritual according to the usual rules.

**Ritual Casting:** When casting ritual spells, breakthroughs increase the power of the spell, as per ritual learning above. However, the increase in power occurs only for that particular instance of the ritual. Achieving a revolutionary breakthroughwhile casting **cataclysm** will wreak incredible havoc, but the next **cataclysm** the caster performs will have its usual effects.

| **Magical Mutations Sub-Table** | |
| **Roll** | **Mutation Suffered** |
| 1 | You either (50% either way) shrink to half size (as per *shrinking*)or grow to giant size (as per a *growth*). You are unused to your new size, and your DEX is immediately reduced to 3. Each week spent at your new size increases your DEX by 1 point until it reaches its normal score. |
| 2 | You acquire the characteristics of the animal that your character most resembles (Judge’s discretion). As a result of this change, 3 attributes will be increased by 2 points, and 3 other attributes will be decreased by 2 points. |
| 3 | Your skin thickens like rhinoceros hide. You gain a bonus of +2 to your armor class, but lose 1 point of DEX and CHA because the skin is clumsy and unattractive. |
| 4 | Your physical form becomes exceptionally delicate, but very beautiful. You gain 4 points of CHA (maximum 18) but lose 4 points of STR (minimum 3). You are a subject of objectification and jealousy by those attracted to your sex, but tend to be scorned as useless by those not attracted to your sex. |
| 5 | You grow an alien eye on the center of your forehead. The eye stays lidded most of the time. Three times per day you may unlid the eye and use *telepathy*(as the spell). Normal men view you with fear and trepidation (-3 to reaction rolls). |
| 6 | You take on the pallor and stench of death. You suffer a -4 to reaction rolls with living creatures, but undead treat you like one of them unless you attack them or cast a good-aligned spell in their presence. |
| 7 | Your nails become long and sharp. You may make claw attacks for 1d4 damage, but suffer a -1 penalty on any proficiency throws involving fine manipulation. If you cut your nails, they re-grow in 1 turn. |
| 8 | Your mouth grows large and your teeth fanged. You can bite for 1d6 damage, but can no longer speak human or demi-human languages intelligibly. You can still cast spells. |
| 9 | One of your arms becomes a hideous tentacle. You may make tentacle attacks for 1d8 damage, but your CHA is reduced by 3 points, and you have a -4 penalty on any rolls involving fine manipulation, use of weapons, or similar actions. You cannot use bows or two-handed weapons. |
| 10 | You transform into a sapient monster. The type of monster will be determined by the Judge based on your alignment, temperament, and other characteristics. Rules for transformations to monstrous forms are found in the ***Judges Journal.*** |
| 11 | You mutate into a sapient monster inappropriate to your prior identity. The type of monster will be determined by the Judge based on the opposite of your alignment, temperament, and other characteristics. (For instance, a chaotic warlock might be turned into a lammasu.) Rules for transformations to monstrous forms are found in the ***Judges Journal***. |
| 12 | The fabric of your mind frays and cracks. Each day upon awakening, you must save v. Spells or completely forget who you are. Once dementia sets in, the effect lasts for 1d6 days. |
| 13 | Your thoughts dissolve into madness. Roll for your actions each round as if suffering an *incite madness*spell. The madness lasts for 1d6 days and thereafter has a 5% cumulative chance of recurring each day, with each relapse lasting 1d6 days. |
| 14 | Your blood thins and begins to leak from your orifices. If you are reduced to 1/2 hit points or less, the bleeding is of such magnitude that you lose 1 hp per round until dead or the blood flow is staunched. A successful Healing proficiency throw or **cure** spell with staunch the bleeding, but it will immediately resume if you are again injured to below 1/2 hp). |
| 15 | You instantly age halfway to your racial maximum age. If already over halfway, you age to 1 year from racial maximum age. Make a Death saving throw to survive the shock to your system. |
| 16 | Your body degenerates grotesquely. You lose 1d3 points of STR, DEX, and CON permanently, and your speed is halved. |
| 17 | Your bones become brittle and hollow. Your CON is halved, and you take double damage from bludgeoning attacks (maces, hammers, etc.) and falls. Your weight is reduced by 30%. |
| 18 | Your body is afflicted with a wasting disease. Your CHA and CON are permanently reduced by 1d3 points immediately and another 1 point each day. A *cure disease*spell slows the waste by one day, but does not dispel the effect. |
| 19 | Your body degenerates into a rotting piece of meat. Maggots constantly crawl from your orifices, and flies buzz around you ceaselessly. Your CHA is reduced to 3, and your speed is halved. You no longer heal naturally. |
| 20 | You dissolve into a sentient ochre jelly. You retain your mental characteristics, but you cannot speak, use items, cast spells, open locks, or perform similar actions. Any equipment on your body is instantly destroyed at the time of transformation. |

| **Spell Signatures Sub-Table** | |
| **Roll** | **Side Effect Acquired** |
| 1 | You emanate a magical glow, equal to an *illumination* spell, for one round after you cast a spell. (If chaotic, you instead emanate a magical *tenebrosity*). |
| 2 | A mumbling sound fills the air for one round after you cast a spell. A successful Hear Noise throw by nearby creatures will hear the sound, unless it is obscured by a battle or other loud noise nearby. |
| 3 | Any candles, torches, or lanterns near you are snuffed out whenever you cast a spell. The effect extends around you to a radius of 1’ per spell level. |
| 4 | All non-magical plants near you wilt and die whenever you cast a spell. The effect extends around you to a radius of 1’ per spell level. Plant-like monsters within the area of effect take 1 point of damage per spell level. |
| 5 | A faint and unpleasant aroma lingers around you whenever you cast a spell. The stench remains for 1 turn (10 minutes) per spell level. While it lingers, you suffer a -3 penalty on reaction rolls. |
| 6 | When you cast a spell, everything around you seems hideous and rotten, as if from a terrible nightmare. You suffer a -2 penalty to saving throws for 1 round per spell level. |
| 7 | When you cast a spell, you feel disembodied and ghostly, as if in a dream. You suffer a -1 to initiative and -2 to attack throws for 1 round per spell level. |
| 8 | Your spell signature makes normal animals angry and fearful. Any within 10’ will immediately attack you (if wild) or flee (if domesticated). The effect lasts for 1 turn (10 minutes) per spell level. |
| 9 | After you cast a spell, you experience nerve-wracking sensations (e.g. bugs crawling on your skin or restless limbs). The sensations are not actually harmful, but they are so distracting that you suffer a -2 penalty to initiative. The effect lasts for 1 round per level. Repeatedly casting spells makes the initiative penalty cumulative as the sensations become increasingly overwhelming. If you become undead, this effect is removed. |
| 10 | Your magic diffuses into your spell signature, rather than channeling into your spells. Any damaging spells do 1 less point of damage per die, and saving throws against your magic are at +2. |

| 15 | Your spell signature is filled with glorious images that entrance and seduce you. You cannot take any action for 1 round after you cast a spell. |
| 16 | Whenever you cast a spell, your shadow transforms into the monster of the same name. The shadow has 1 HD per spell level and attacks you ceaselessly until destroyed. If you cast spells in total darkness, this prevents the effect. |
| 17 | Your magic burns you with power. Each time you cast a spell, any flammable material you carry is ignited. This includes most clothing, torches, paper, oil, etc. If any material is ignited, you suffer 1d8 damage for 2 rounds. |
| 18 | You must pay for your spells with your own flesh and blood. Each time you cast a spell, you lose 1 lb per spell level. Once your weight dips below 1.5 lbs/inch, you begin to weaken, losing 3 points of CON per 10 lbs thereafter. If you become undead, this effect is removed. |
| 19 | The chaotic energies released by your spells take a terrible toll on your body. Each time you cast a spell, you age 1 year per spell level. If you become undead, this effect is removed. |
| 20 | Casting spells sends harmful negative energy coursing through your body. Each time you cast a spell, you suffer 1 point of damage per spell level. If you become undead, this effect is removed. |

| 20 | **Spell-like Abilities:** The creature gains 1d4 spell-like abilities, each usable 1/day. Generate the abilities as if rolling for spell scrolls or select appropriate abilities based on the creature’s other powers (Judge’s choice). |

When rolling on the Unexpected Abilities table, re-roll any results that duplicate abilities the creature already possesses except where otherwise noted. At the Judge’s discretion, particular special abilities may be chosen based on existing powers, or adjusted to match earlier results. For example, if the first ability a creature gains is a lightning aura, and a later roll indicates an immunity, it would make sense for the immunity to be versus lightning. All results are cumulative.
