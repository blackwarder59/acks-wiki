## Starting Age

Roll on the **Character Starting Age** table to determine the age of your 1st level character. Starting age has no immediate effect on the character, but an ***ACKS***campaign can span many game years of time, during which adventurers can grow old and die. In addition, some monsters and magic can cause premature aging and death.

The **Character Aging** table shows the lifespan of the human, demi-human, and humanoid races, broken into five age categories (Youth, Adult, Middle Aged, Old, and Ancient). Elves and Nobir, being ageless, never progress past adult.

| **Race** | **Youth** | **Adult** | **Middle Aged** | **Old** | **Ancient** |
| Beastman | 12 – 15 | 16 – 30 | 31 – 45 | 46 – 60 | 61 – 75 |
| Dwarf | 15 – 25 | 26 – 50 | 51 – 75 | 76 – 115 | 116 – 150 |

| Human | 13 – 17 | 18 – 35 | 36 – 55 | 56 – 75 | 76 – 95 |

| Zaharan | 13 – 17 | 18 – 35 | 36 – 55 | 56 – 75 | 76 – 95 |

At each stage, progressively adjust the character’s ability scores as noted on the **Ability Score Adjustments by Age** table. For characters generated at an already advanced age, the cumulative ability score adjustments appropriate to the character’s age can be used. Ability score adjustments from aging cannot reduce an ability score below a class minimum, and in no case lower than 3.

### Death from Old Age

Characters can die of old age, though this is a rare fate for adventurers! The chance of death from old age is resolved witha Death saving throw. Characters must make a Death saving throw within 1d12 months of reaching the following ages:

* Racial minimum Old age + character’s Constitution
* Racial minimum Ancient age + character’s Constitution
* Racial maximum listed age, and each year thereafter

EXAMPLE: Marcus has CON 18 as an adult. By the time he reaches the Old age category (56), his CON is reduced to 14. He must save versus Death when he reaches (56 + 14) age 70. He succeeds, so he will not perish due to natural causes just yet. When he reaches the Ancient age category (76), his CON is down to 12. He must save versus Death when he reaches (76 + 12) age 88. He succeeds again. When Marcus reaches age 95, and each year thereafter, he will have to save versus Death again.

Neither **restore life and limb** nor **resurrection** can raise characters who have died from old age. However, a **miracle** or **wish** can do so, bringing the character back to life as an adult.
