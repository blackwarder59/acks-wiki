## Speed and Encumbrance

Characters can move at one of four basic speeds: exploration speed, combat speed, running speed, and expedition speed. (Special types of movement, including climbing, crawling, rappelling, sneaking, swimming, and traversing, are discussed later.)

* **Exploration speed** is measured in feet per turn and represents a pace appropriate to cautious exploration and careful mapping in an area of treacherous ground, shadowy obscurity, and dangerous pitfalls. An unencumbered human has an exploration speed of 120 feet per turn.
* **Combat speed** is measured in feet per round and represents a brief hustle in conditions of danger and distraction. Combat speed is generally used only during encounters or other circumstances where time is tracked in rounds. An unencumbered human has a combat speed of 40 feet per round.
* **Running speed** is measured in feet per round and represents the fastest pace an adventurer can maintain in combat. Characters can only run for brief periods of time before needing rest. An unencumbered human has a running speed of 120 feet per round.
* **Expedition speed** is measured in miles per day and represents the distance which a character travels for each day spent traveling as the party’s dedicated activity. An unencumbered human has an expedition speed of 24 miles per day.

The relationship between the four speeds is shown on the table below.

|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Exploration Speed | Combat Speed | Running Speed | Expedition Speed |  |
| 120 feet per turn | 40 feet per round | 120 feet per round | 24 miles per day |  |
| (Speed) feet per turn | (Speed / 3) feet per round | (Speed) feet per round | (Speed / 5) miles per day |  |

Speed is modified by **encumbrance**. Encumbrance indicates how much equipment and treasure characters are carrying. Encumbrance is important because characters can only carry so much, and if they are heavily weighed down with equipment they cannot carry as much treasure, nor move as fast.

Encumbrance is measured in **stones**. Stonesare an abstract unit of weight for creatures, objects, and other things in the game world. Historically a stone varied from 8 to 14 lbs depending on what was being measured. ***ACKS II***assumes a stone weighs around 10 lbs, but it is left purposefully abstract to represent an amalgam of weight, bulk, and general portability. A typical item like a sword weighs 1/6 stone. A typical man-sized creature weighs 15 stone (abstractly representing anywhere from 120 and 210 lbs). The maximum encumbrance any man-sized character can carry is 20 stone, plus his Strength modifier.

### Calculating Encumbrance

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Item | Encumbrance in Stone |
| Worn clothing | 0 stone |
| Armor | 1 stone per point of AC |
| Shield | 1 stone per shield |
| Typical Item | 1 stone per 6 items |
| Heavy Item | 1 stone or more |
| Treasure | 1 stone per 1,000 coins or gems |

If your character is built using a template, your template will indicate your character’s starting encumbrance. If you are purchasing equipment for your character, you will need to calculate your character’s encumbrance. The Equipment tables will list the amount of encumbrance per item. You can also use the adjoining table to determine the number of stone encumbering your character.

When counting items, each weapon, scroll, potion, vial, wand, magic item, or other object counts as an item. Multiple small items sold as a bundle (such as 12 spikes, 6 torches, 20 arrows, etc.) count as one item for this purpose. Very small single items (such as 1 silver arrow) can be ignored for encumbrance purposes, but if carried in number should be counted as 1 item. (No, a character can’t carry 20 silver arrows and have no encumbrance.)

Heavy items generally include any large melee weapon; any item that is more than two-thirds as tall as the carrying character (including composite bows, long bows, spears, staffs, and 10’ poles); any item that weighs 8 lbs or more; and any item that requires two hands to carry (such as chairs or chests). Items weighing more than 14 lbs will weigh more than 1 stone. Armor weighs 1 stone per point of AC it offers, while simple clothing weighs 0 st.

For purposes of encumbrance, 1,000 coins are considered 1 stone. When a carrying device, such as a backpack, lists the weight it can carry in stone, this weight can be converted at 1:1000 from stone to coins to determine how many coins it can carry.

### Calculating Speed

Once your character’s encumbrance is known, it’s time to calculate his speed. A character’s speed will be affected based on encumbrance, as shown on the Character Speed and Encumbrance table, below. For additional information on movement, see the **Time and Movement** section in the **Adventures** chapter.

| **Character Speed and Encumbrance** | | | |  |
| **Encumbrance** | **Exploration**  **Speed** | **Combat**  **Speed** | **Running**  **Speed** | **Expedition**  **Speed** |
| Up to 5 stone | 120’ per turn | 40’ per round | 120’ per round | 24 miles |
| Up to 7 stone | 90’ per turn | 30’ per round | 90’ per round | 18 miles |
| Up to 10 stone | 60’ per turn | 20’ per round | 60’ per round | 12 miles |
| Up to 20 stone + STR mod | 30’ per turn | 10’ per round | 30’ per round | 6 miles |

EXAMPLE: Marcus is carrying a two-handed sword (1 heavy item), a crossbow (1 item), a mace (1 item), 2 daggers (1 item each), a backpack (1 item), 1 week’s iron rations (1 heavy item), a tinderbox (1 item), 2 flasks of oil (1 item each), a small mirror (1 item), a pound of wolfsbane (1 item), a pound of garlic (1 item), and a case with 20 bolts (1 item). He is carrying 12 items, which counts as 2 stone. His two-handed sword and iron rations, together count as heavy items, add another 2 stone. Finally, he is wearing plate armor (AC 6), which counts as 6 stone. His total encumbrance is 10 stone, so his exploration movement is 60’ per turn. Later, he picks up 8,000 silver pieces. This increases his encumbrance to 18 stone, and reduces his exploration movement to 30’ per turn. His combat speed, running speed, and expedition speed all change when his exploration speed changes.
