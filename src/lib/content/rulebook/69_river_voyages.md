## River Voyages

Not every voyage involves sailing across the high seas. Sometimes the adventurers will want to engage in trade or travel along the navigable rivers of the realm. Current and depth become primary considerations for river voyages.

### River Current

The water current at the ocean surface is moved primarily by winds, but the water current of rivers is moved primarily by changes in elevation — rivers flow downward from mountains into flatlands and eventually drain into lakes or seas. Therefore, in addition to wind direction and wind strength, **river current direction** and **river current speed** affect river voyages. Rivers are also much shallower than seas, so **river depth** can become an issue.

###### River Current Direction

A vessel that is moving with the current is moving downriver, while a vessel moving against the current is moving upriver. River current direction will be determined by the Judge based on his regional and campaign maps. For instance, in the Auran Empire setting, the Ammasaurëan Sea sits in a depression between two great mountain ranges, the Jutting Mountains in the north and the Meniri Mountains in the south. Rivers with their source in the Jutting Mountains thus tend to flow south to the sea, while rivers sourced in the Meniri flow north to the sea.

###### River Current Speed

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Current Speed | Voyage Speed Modifier |
| Placid | ±6 miles (1 hex) |
| Gentle | ±12 miles (2 hexes) |
| Slow | ±18 miles (3 hexes) |
| Moderate | ±24 miles (4 hexes) |
| Swift | ±36 miles (6 hexes) |
| Rapid | ±48 miles (8 hexes) |

A vessel moving downriver gains a bonus to its voyage speed, while a vessel moving upriver suffers a penalty to its voyage speed. The magnitude of the bonus or penalty depends on whether the current speed is placid (0.5 mph), gentle (1 mph), slow (1.5 mph), moderate (2 mph), swift (3 mph), or rapid (4 mph). The voyage speed modifier applies to both sailing and rowing speed. It is applied after wind direction and wind speed modifiers. River current speed will be determined by the Judge based on his regional and campaign maps.

EXAMPLE: A barge on the Kem River is traveling north with a cargo of quarried stone downriver to the Ammasaurëan Sea. The barge has a voyage speed of 60 miles per day under sail and 36 miles per day under oar. The wind is moderate westerly, so the barge is beam reaching (1/2 sailing speed), reducing its sailing speed to just 30 miles per day. Therefore the barge is under oar to use its voyage speed of 36 miles per day. The Kem River has a moderate current, modifying voyage speed by 24 miles. Since the barge is sailing downriver, the modifier increases its voyage speed to 60 miles per day. If the barge were sailing upriver, its voyage speed would be just 12 miles per day under these conditions.

### River Depth

Rivers are also much shallower and narrower than seas, so **river** **depth** can become an issue. The depth and width of the river determines the size of the vessels that can travel and maneuver on it. Navigable rivers can range from 6’ to 500’ deep or more. The Judge will determine the depth of rivers based on his campaign and regional maps.

|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Vessel** | **Draft** |  |  | **Vessel** | **Draft** |
| Boat, Row | 6” |  |  | Galley, 4-Rower | 4’ |
| Boat, Sail | 2’ |  |  | Galley, 5-Rower | 5’ |
| Canoe | 6” |  |  | Galley, 6-Rower | 6’ |
| Galley, 1-Rower | 2’4” |  |  | Gallery, 8-Rower’ | 8’ |
| Galley, 1.5-Rower | 2’6” |  |  | Longship | 2’6” |
| Galley, 2-Rower | 2’6” |  |  | Sailing Ship, Small | 5’ |
| Galley, 2.5-Rower | 2’6” |  |  | Sailing Ship, Large | 10’ |
| Galley, 3-Rower | 3’ |  |  | Sailing Ship, Huge | 12’6” |

If the river’s depth is at least 2’ deeper than the vessel’s draft, the vessel can safely sail or row on the river. If the river’s depth is less than the vessel’s draft, then it cannot sail or row on the river at all. If the river’s depth is greater than the vessel’s draft but by less than 2’, the vessel can sail or row on the river but each river hex is treated as a sandbar/shoal nautical hazard (p. XX). However, galleys and longships do not gain a +4 bonus vs. sandbars/shoals in rivers; it’s already factored into their shallow draft.
