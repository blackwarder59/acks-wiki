## Encumbrance and Equipment

**Encumbrance** measures how much equipment and treasure characters are carrying. Encumbrance is important because characters can only carry so much, and if they are heavily weighed down with equipment they cannot carry as much treasure, nor move as fast. Encumbrance is measured in **stone**. A stone is a historical unit of measure that varied from 8 to 14 lbs depending on what was being measured. ***ACKS***assumes a stone weighs around 10 lbs, but it is left purposefully abstract to represent an amalgam of weight, bulk, and generally portability. Most items have an encumbrance of 1/6 of a stone; that is, six items count as one stone. See **Speed and Encumbrance** in Chapter 1 for a full discussion of the impact of encumbrance on speed.

| Item | Encumbrance in Stone |
| Worn clothing | 0 stone |
| Armor | 1 stone per point of AC |
| Shield | 1 stone per shield |
| Typical Item | 1 stone per 6 items |
| Heavy Item | 1 stone or more |
| Treasure | 1 stone per 1,000 coins or gems |

When counting items, each weapon, scroll, potion, vial, wand, magic item, or other object counts as an item. Multiple small items sold as a bundle (such as 6 spikes, 6 torches, 20 arrows, etc.) count as one item for this purpose. Very small single items (such as 1 silver arrow) can be ignored for encumbrance purposes, but if carried in number should be counted as 1 item. (No, a character cannot buy 20 silver arrows and have no encumbrance.)

Heavy items generally include any large melee weapon; any item that is more than two-thirds as tall as the carrying character (including composite bows, long bows, spears, staffs, and 10’ poles); any item that weighs 8lbs or more; and any item that requires two hands to carry (such as chairs or chests). Items weighing more than 14lb will weigh more than 1 stone.

For purposes of encumbrance, 1,000 coins are considered 1 stone. When a carrying device, such as a backpack, lists the weight it can carry in stone, this weight can be converted at 1:1000 from stone to coins to determine how many coins it can carry.

In order to carry more equipment and treasure, characters can purchase beasts of burdens and ground vehicles. Each animal or vehicle has a normal and maximum load it can carry in stone, as shown on the Animal/Vehicle Speed and Encumbrance table. The figure to the left of the slash is the animal or vehicle’s speed per turn when not encumbered (carrying its normal load limit or less), and the figure to the right of the slash is its speed per turn when encumbered (carrying more than a normal load but not more than a maximum load).

For purposes of carrying capacity, a man-sized humanoid is assumed to weigh 15 stone (about 120 – 210 lbs). Carried or worn equipment adds to this weight. For instance, a cavalry soldier with a spear (1 stone), shield (1 stone), and leather armor (2 stone) would impose 19 stone of encumbrance on his mount.

Remember that wheeled vehicles can only move through deserts, mountains, forests, or swamps if a road is available. However, when a character with Driving proficiency drives a wheeled vehicle on a road or trail, the movement bonus from the road is increased to 2x. (A proficient driver in a cart or wagon can thus travel about 24 miles per day, averaging 3 miles per hour.)
