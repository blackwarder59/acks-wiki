Priestesses are female divine spellcasters devoted to goddesses of nature, fertility, wisdom, or magic. They serve as healers, oracles, and guardians of ancient wisdom. Unlike crusaders who often serve more martial deities, priestesses typically follow more peaceful goddess traditions. The most common priestess orders serve Demeter, Artemis, or Hecate.

## Combat Characteristics

Priestesses are not trained for warfare, focusing instead on spiritual matters and divine magic. They rely on their divine powers and allies for protection in dangerous situations.

**Combat Proficiencies:** Priestesses have weapon proficiency with clubs, crossbows, daggers, darts, oil, slings, staves, and any weapons favored by their goddess. They have armor proficiency with light armor. They have no fighting style proficiencies.

**Combat Progression:** Priestesses advance in attack throws and saving throws as mages, by one point every three levels of experience. Priestesses increase their base damage roll from successful missile and melee attacks by +1 at 1st level and by an additional +1 at 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th level.

## Magic

Priestesses are powerful divine spellcasters who receive their magic from their patron goddess. Their magic tends to focus on healing, divination, nature, and protection rather than combat.

**Spell Acquisition:** Priestesses acquire spells through prayer and meditation. They do not use spell books. All priestess spells of the appropriate level are considered to be "known" by the priestess and she need not select them individually. Priestesses can cast 1st level spells from 1st level.

**Spell Slots:** A priestess's spell-casting ability is summarized on the **Priestess Spell Progression** table. That table shows the number of spell slots available at each class level, according to the level of the spell. A 1st level priestess can cast one 1st level spell per day, while a 14th level priestess can cast six 1st level spells, six 2nd level spells, five 3rd level spells, five 4th level spells, four 5th level spells, and three 6th level spells per day.

**Spell Casting:** Priestesses must have their hands free to cast spells. Priestesses cannot cast divine spells while wearing armor heavier than light armor. Priestesses may cast spells from a spell scroll of divine spells, regardless of class, with a proficiency throw of 10+ (adding the spell level to this throw).

**Spell List:** The list of spells available to priestesses can be found at the end of this chapter.

**Restoring Magic:** Priestesses regain their ability to cast spells through prayer and meditation. They must spend at least 4 hours in prayer to recover their spell slots.

## Starting Class Powers

At the start of play, priestesses have the class powers below:

**Divine Favor:** Priestesses serve specific goddesses and can gain divine favor for their devout service. A priestess begins play with 2d6 points of divine favor with her patron goddess. Additional rules for divine favor can be found in the **Campaigns** chapter.

**Healing:** Priestesses are blessed with extraordinary healing abilities. Once per day per level, a priestess can cure light wounds by touch, healing 1d6+1 points of damage. This ability can also be used to neutralize poison or cure disease, but this uses three daily uses of the healing power.

**Nature Affinity:** Priestesses have a special connection to the natural world. They can communicate with normal animals as if using speak with animals at will. They also gain a +2 bonus to all proficiency throws related to nature, animals, or plants.

**Oracle:** Once per day, a priestess can seek divine guidance from her goddess. This functions as the augury spell but can be used without expending a spell slot. At higher levels, this ability improves (see Additional Class Powers).

**Turn Undead:** Priestesses can channel divine power to drive away or destroy undead creatures. This ability functions as a crusader's turn undead ability, using the priestess's class level. See the **Crusader** class description for complete rules on turning undead.

## Additional Class Powers

When they advance in level, priestesses gain the following additional class powers:

**Improved Oracle (5th level):** The priestess's oracle ability now functions as divination instead of augury.

**Lay on Hands (7th level):** The priestess can heal others by laying on hands. This ability can heal 1 point of damage per priestess level, once per day. This is in addition to her regular healing ability.

**Greater Oracle (9th level):** The priestess's oracle ability now functions as commune instead of divination, and can be used twice per day.

**Sanctuary (9th level):** By acquiring a **sanctuary** worth at least 10,000gp, the priestess can attract followers to serve her. 2d6 1st level priestesses and 1d6 1st level healers will arrive to serve her within 1d6 weeks of her acquiring the sanctuary. If the priestess already has a sanctuary, the followers arrive within 1d6 weeks of her reaching 9th level. If hired, the followers must be paid standard rates for henchmen. These followers will serve the character with loyalty as long as she maintains her devotion to her goddess. A wise priestess can use her sanctuary to provide healing to the community, offer guidance and counsel, and build a network of faithful followers. Additional rules for sanctuaries are detailed in the **Campaigns** chapter.

**Avatar (13th level):** Once per week, the priestess can call upon her goddess to temporarily become an avatar of divine power. For one turn (10 minutes), the priestess gains:
- +4 bonus to all saving throws
- +2 bonus to attack throws and damage rolls
- Immunity to fear, charm, and hold effects
- Double the number of spell slots for that day
- Access to one 7th level spell of the Judge's choice

## Class Proficiencies

**Proficiency Progression:** At 1st level, priestesses select one class proficiency from their class proficiency list and one general proficiency from the general proficiency list. They select an additional class proficiency at 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th level. They select an additional general proficiency at 5th, 9th, and 13th level.

**Priestess Proficiency List:** Alchemy, Animal Training, Art (any), Ceremonial Magic, Contemplation, Diplomacy, Healing, Herbalism, Knowledge, Language, Leadership, Lore, Mapping, Meditation, Naturalism, Performance, Prophecy, Riding, Soothsaying, Theology, Tracking
