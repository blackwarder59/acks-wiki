## Unit Characteristics Summary

The following tables summarize thecharacteristics for common demi-human, human, and beastman troops.

**Daily Move/Weekly Move:** See Chapter 10, **Moving Armies,** p. XX.

**Monthly Wage:** Monthly wage is equal to the troops’ monthly wage x 120 (for infantry) or x 60 (for cavalry or large creatures).

**Supply Cost:** Supply cost is generally 60gp per week for infantry units and 240gp per week for cavalry units. Units without quartermasters, and carnivorous units, cost more. See Chapter 10, **Supply Cost**, p. XX.

**Specialist Cost:** For all units except untrained conscripts and militia, we assume there is 1 quartermaster (40gp) and 1 armorer, 2 journeymen, and 4 apprentices (costing 160gp) per 480 infantry or 240 cavalry troops, for a net cost per company of (50 + 160)/4 = 50gp.

**Cost to Field:** The cost to field a unit is equal to monthly wage cost plus monthly specialist cost plus 4 x weekly supply cost.

**Battle Rating**: The measure of the unit’s value on the battlefield. See Chapter 11, **Battle Ratings**, p. XX.
