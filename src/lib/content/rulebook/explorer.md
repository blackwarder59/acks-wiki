# Explorer

Key Attribute: CON

Requirements: None

Hit Dice: 1d6

Maximum Level: 14

Explorers are scouts, settlers, and surveyors hardened to the challenges of the wild. Few adventuring parties would dare the wilderness without an experienced explorer to guide them. Within the Auran Empire, an explorer might be an Imperial scout from the Legions, a barbarian hunter from the northern forests of Jutland, or a settler pushing past the borders of the Empire.

## Combat Characteristics

Because weapons and armor are cumbersome and exhausting on long journeys, explorers tend to stay lightly equipped and prefer to evade foes where possible. That said, many fighters have underestimated explorers to their peril, for they are skilled archers and warriors when they need to be.

**Combat Proficiencies:** Explorers have weapon proficiency with all missile weapons and with all tiny, small, and medium melee weapons. They have armor proficiency with medium, light, and very light armor. They have fighting style proficiency with all three optional styles (i.e. the dual weapon, two-handed weapon, and weapon and shield styles).

**Combat Progression:** Like fighters, explorers advance in attack throws and saving throws by two points every three levels of experience. They increase their base damage roll from successful missile and melee attacks by +1 at 1st level, and by an additional +1 at 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th level. They can cleave after killing a foe a maximum of once per round per class level.

## Starting Class Powers

At the start of play, explorers have the following class powers. Some of the explorer's powers require him to be in familiar territory. At 1st level, an explorer is considered familiar with the settled territory of his starting region as well as unsettled territory within one 24-mile hex radius of settled territories. With each additional level of experience, the radius increases one 24-mile hex further from settled territory.

**Alertness:** Explorers are always alert to danger.An explorer gains a +1 bonus to avoid surprise. When using Adventuring proficiency to search or listen, he succeeds on a proficiency throw of 14+ (instead of the usual 18+). If separately proficient in Searching or Listening, he gains a +2 bonus to his throw instead.

**Ambushing:** Explorers are skilled at ambushing unprepared enemies. An explorer can ambush any **vulnerable** opponent. Ambushes can be made in melee or with missile weapons at short range, but cannot be made with missile weapons at medium or longer range. When ambushing, an explorer gets a +4 bonus on his attack throws and deals an extra die of damage on the attack. (This class power is the equivalent of Ambushing proficiency.)

**Animal Reflexes:** Explorers react to danger as fast as a deer to a wolf. An explorer gains a +1 bonus to initiative and a +1 bonus to avoid surprise. (This bonus stacks with the bonus from Alertness, so in most cases explorers have a +2 bonus to avoid surprise.)

**Endurance**: Explorers are inured to the hardship and fatigue of travel. When exploring, an explorer does not need to rest every 6 turns. An explorer can force march for one day without penalty, plus one additional day for each point of Constitution bonus. (This class power is equivalent to Endurance proficiency.)

**Evasion:** Explorers learn to avoid the wild beasts of the wilderness. When the explorer guides the party in familiar territory, the party gains a +5 bonus to proficiency throws to evade wilderness encounters. The explorer's party can evade wilderness encounters even when **surprised** provided the explorer is not surprised. See **Evasion** (p. xx) for more details on evading encounters.

**Pathfinding:** Explorers rarely lose their bearings, even in trackless wilderness. When the explorer guides a party in familiar territory, the party gains a +4 bonus on proficiency throws to avoid getting lost. See **Wilderness Expeditions** section of Chapter 6 (p. XX) for more details on getting lost.

**Natural Stealth:** As hunters and wilderness scouts, explorers are naturally sneaky. Opponents suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls when encountering an explorer approaching from outside line of sight or lying in wait in cover or darkness.

## Additional Class Powers

When they advance in level, explorers gain the following additional class powers:

**Experience and Hardiness (5th level):** When an explorer reaches 5th level (Guide), his experience and hardiness reassure those who follow him into the wild. Hirelings on a wilderness adventure led by the explorer gain a +1 bonus to their morale score. This bonus stacks with any modifiers from Charisma or proficiencies.

**Border Fort (9th level):** By acquiring a **border fort** worth at least 15,000gp, the explorer can attract followers to his service. 5d6 x 10 0th level troops and 1d6 explorers of 1st – 3rd level arrive to serve him within 1d3 months of him acquiring the border fort. If the explorer already has a border fort, the followers arrive to serve him within 1d3 months of him reaching 9th level. The explorer must pay his followers the ordinary rates for mercenaries and henchmen or they leave his service. In time, the explorer might become the warden of a flourishing colony. In order for a stronghold to count as a border fort, it must be constructed in outlands or unsettled territory. An explorer within 24 miles of a domain secured by his border fort never becomes lost and gains an additional +4 bonus to evade encounters because of his familiarity with the region. Additional rules for border forts are detailed in the **Campaigns** chapter (p. XX).

## Class Proficiencies

**Proficiency Progression:** At 1st level, explorers select one class proficiency from their class proficiency list and one general proficiency from the general proficiency list.
