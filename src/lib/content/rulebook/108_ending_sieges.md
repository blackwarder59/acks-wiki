## Ending Sieges

A siege ends when (1) the defending army sallies forth and gives battle to the besieging army; (2) the defending army surrenders; (3) the besieging army departs the hex; (4) the besieging army captures or destroys the stronghold.

### Defending Army Sallies Forth

A siege can be ended by the defending army if it exits the stronghold and gives battle. Even if greatly outnumbered, a defending army might sally forth if it has run out of supplies, or if the besieging army will be reinforced soon. As soon as the defending army sallies forth, it must immediately fight a **pitched battle** against the besieging army. See Chapter 11, **Resolving Battles** (p. XX).

If the defending army loses the pitched battle, it may retreat back into the stronghold, or retreat into an adjacent 6-mile hex, but is subject to pursuit either way. If the defending army wins the battle, the besieging army is subject to the normal rules for retreat and pursuit.

### Defending Army Surrenders

A siege can be ended by the defending army if it surrenders. Surrender can be voluntary or involuntary. A voluntary surrender occurs when the defending army’s leader negotiates surrender with the besieging army’s leader. An involuntary surrender occurs when all of the units within the stronghold fail loyalty rolls due to calamities. An army leader is likely to get better terms if he surrenders while a portion of his force is still intact, so a leader who sees his supplies dwindling and his army’s morale collapsing may choose to voluntarily surrender to avoid an involuntary surrender later. Either way, the besieging army has won the siege.

### Besieging Army Departs the Hex

A siege can be ended by the besieging army if it departs the hex with all of its units. If this occurs, the defending army has won the siege. The besieging army can continue the siege, however, simply by leaving a unit in the hex (assuming there is sufficient circumvallation). Such a scant force may invite the defending army to sally forth, of course.

### Besieging Army Captures the Stronghold

A siege can be ended by the besieging army if it captures or destroys the stronghold. A stronghold can be captured by assault, or destroyed by reduction. Either way, the besieging army has won the siege.

A stronghold is captured in an assault whenever all of the defending units are defeated and there are no units in reserve. If at least one defending unit remains undefeated after the assault, the stronghold has held.

A stronghold is destroyed by reduction when its structural hit points are reduced to 0. Any defending units in the stronghold must either sally forth or surrender when this occurs.

### Spoils of Sieges

As with a battle, the spoils of war from a victorious siege are equal to one month’s wages of each defeated unit. In addition, each prisoner captured is worth 40gp if sold as a slave or ransomed. Experience points are assigned as with a battle. See Chapter 11, **Spoils of War** (p. XX).

In addition to the spoils taken from the dead troops, the stronghold and domain itself can be a rich source of plunder. A victorious besieger may pillage the domain. See Chapter 10, **Pillaging Domains** (p. XX). Again, terms of a voluntary surrender may forbid the besieger from pillaging the domain, but whether this agreement is honored will depend on the besieger.
