## Equipment Availability on Campaign

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Army Size** | **Market Class** |
| 72,000 troops or more | II |
| 36,001 – 72,000 troops | III |
| 12,001 – 36,000 troops | IV |
| 3,001 - 12,000 troops | V |
| 1,200 - 3,000 troops | VI |

An army of even modest size will be accompanied by a baggage train that includes merchants, craftsmen, and tinkers that supply the army with its equipment. This allows an army of 1,200 troops (12 units) or more to function as its own market for purposes of **equipment availability**, as shown on the adjacent table. This benefit is lost if the army’s supply lines become blocked or over-extended.
