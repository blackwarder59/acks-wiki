# Thief

Key Attribute: DEX

Requirements: None

Hit Dice: 1d4

Maximum Level: 14

Where other classes rely on their valor in battle or power with magic, thieves rely on cunning, stealth, and subterfuge. Sometimes a thief will belong to an organized criminal syndicate from the character's local town, where he can seek shelter and information between adventures. However, many adventuring thieves are independent of any guild, and some even refuse to call themselves thieves at all — preferring terms such as expert treasure hunter, gentleman adventurer, or dungeoneer. In the Auran Empire, thieves are everywhere, from the slums of the ports of Kushtu to the highest halls of the Senate in Aura.

## Combat Characteristics

Thieves are trained combatants, although not as skilled as fighters. Because of their need of stealth and free movement, they tend to be lightly equipped and not sufficiently armored to endure a stand-up fight.

**Combat Proficiencies:** Thieves have weapon proficiency with all missile weapons and with all tiny, small, and medium melee weapons. They have armor proficiency with light and very light armor. They have fighting style proficiency with the dual weapon and two-handed weapon styles, but not with the weapon and shield style.

**Combat Progression:** Thieves advance in attack throws and saving throws by two points every four levels of experience. They do not gain any bonus to damage as they advance in level. They can cleave after killing a foe a maximum of once per round per every two class levels (rounded down).

## Starting Class Powers

Certain of the thief's class powers, known as his **thief skills**, improve like attack throws and saving throws as the thief gains levels. The progression for each thief skill is shown on the Thief Skills table below. Each thief skill has special rules that apply to it, described in the entry for that class power.

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

| 9 | -2+ | 8+ | 6+ | 7+ | 6+ | 7+ | 6+ | 7+ |
| 10 | -3+ | 6+ | 5+ | 5+ | 4+ | 5+ | 4+ | 5+ |
| 11 | -4+ | 4+ | 4+ | 3+ | 2+ | 3+ | 2+ | 3+ |
| 12 | -5+ | 2+ | 3+ | 1+ | 0+ | 1+ | 0+ | 2+ |
| 13 | -6+ | 0+ | 2+ | -1+ | -2+ | -1+ | -2+ | 2+ |
| 14 | -7+ | -2+ | 1+ | -3+ | -4+ | -3+ | -4+ | 1+ |

**Backstabbing:** Thieves are skilled at treacherously attacking unprepared enemies. A thief can backstab any **vulnerable** opponent. Backstabs can be made in melee or with missile weapons at short range, but cannot be made with missile weapons at medium or longer range. When backstabbing, a thief gains a +4 bonus to hit and if the attack succeeds, the thief deals an additional die of damage at 1st level, and another additional die at 5th, 9th, and 13th level.

**Climbing:** Thieves are adept at scaling sheer surfaces, including smooth walls or steep cliffs. The thief must make a Climbing proficiency throw for each 100' climbed (with a minimum of one check required). If the throw succeeds, the thief can safely ascend or descend the distance. If the throw fails, the thief falls a distance equal to half the attempted distance, plus the distance covered by any previous throws, taking 1d6 bludgeoning damage per 10 feet. A thief can climb at his exploration speed or one-third his combat speed without penalty. If he moves at one-half combat speed, he takes a -5 penalty to the proficiency throw, and if he moves at full combat speed, he takes a -10 penalty. For further rules on climbing, see p. XX.

**Hiding:** Thieves are trained to skulk unseen in the cover of darkness. A thief can begin hiding as a combat action anytime he is in cover, dim light, or darkness. When the thief begins hiding, the Judge must make a Hiding proficiency throw on behalf of the thief. A thief will always think he is successful in this skill, and will not know otherwise until others react to his presence. Regardless of whether the throw succeeds, opponents encountering the thief suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls as long as he remains stationary in cover, dim light, or darkness.

If the throw succeeds, the thief is **hidden**. If the throw fails, the thief is not hidden. No creature can claim line of sight on a thief that is hidden from it. If a hidden thief engages an unengaged opponent, the opponent cannot make a free facing change (p. XX). If an opponent knows the hidden thief's general location, the opponent can attack him in melee at a -4 penalty, but it cannot even blindly attack the thief if it doesn't knows his general location. The hidden condition expires at the end of the thief's initiative if he moves or attacks. It also terminates if the cover, dim light, or darkness no longer conceals the thief from his opponents.

**Listening:** Thieves at doors, passageways, or intersections can listen for sounds coming from the other side of the door or passage. The Judge makes a Listening proficiency throw in secret on behalf of the thief. If the throw succeeds, he hears any noises in earshot. If the throw fails, or if there aren't any noises in earshot, he doesn't hear anything. The thief must be quiet and must be the closest creature in the party relative to the location of the sound or suspected sound. Listening only requires one round but can only be undertaken once per turn if the party is moving at all, because it takes time for people to settle down into quiet.

**Lockpicking:** With the aid of thieves' tools, a thief can pick mechanical locks. A thief can pick locks either hastily or methodically.

* Attempting to hastily pick a lock requires one round and a Lockpicking proficiency throw. If the throw succeeds, the lock is opened. If it fails on a natural roll of 1 – 3, the thief breaks his pick in the lock, jamming it. The lock cannot thereafter be picked. If it fails on any other result, the thief cannot figure out how to quickly open the lock. He can still attempt to open it methodically, but cannot make another attempt to hastily pick the same lock again until he reaches a higher experience level.
* Attempting to methodically pick a lock requires one turn (10 minutes) and a Lockpicking proficiency throw with a +4 bonus. If the throw succeeds, the lock is opened. If it fails on a natural roll of 1, the thief breaks his pick in the lock, jamming it. The lock cannot thereafter be picked. If it fails on any other result, the thief fails to pick the lock, but can make another methodical attempt if desired.

Other bonuses or penalties might apply to the throw, depending on the thief's tools, the complexity of the lock, and other factors.

**Pickpocketing:** The thief is practiced in the art of picking pockets and cutting purses. To use this skill, the thief must move within 5' of his target and make a Pickpocketing proficiency throw. If the target is unaware of the thief, the thief gains a +4 bonus to the throw. If the throw succeeds, the target can be robbed of the contents of one pocket, or any one item or tiny or small weapon hung on his person (but not a held item or weapon). If the throw fails, the thief fails to pickpocket the target. If the throw fails, and the roll is a natural roll of 1 or less than half the target value, the intended target notices the thieving attempt. The Judge will then make a reaction roll with a -3 penalty to determine the intended victim's reaction.

**Searching:** Through careful inspection and probing of his surroundings, a thief can find concealed traps, secret doors, obscured objects, buried treasure, and other hidden features. A thief can attempt to search for hidden features either hastily or methodically.

* Attempting to hastily search requires one round and a Searching proficiency throw. The Judge makes the throw in secret on behalf of the thief. If the throw succeeds, the thief notices any hidden features within 5' of his location. If it fails, or there is nothing hidden, the thief finds nothing. The thief cannot make another attempt to hastily search the same area again until he reaches a higher experience level, but he can attempt to methodically search the location.
* Attempting to methodically search requires one turn (10 minutes) and a Searching proficiency throw with a +4 bonus. The Judge makes the throw in secret on behalf of the thief. If the throw succeeds, the thief notices any hidden features within 5' of his location. If the throw fails, or there is nothing hidden, the thief finds nothing. The thief can make repeated attempts to methodically search a location if desired.

When a thief is moving at exploration speed, he can choose to attempt to hastily search as he moves. If so, then anytime the thief moves within 5' of a hidden feature, the Judge secretly makes a proficiency throw on his behalf. If the throw succeeds, the thief notices it (and if it's a trap, he notices it before triggering it). If the throw fails, the thief does not notice anything (and, if it's a trap, he or another character in the party might trigger it as they move). Note that this counts as a failure to hastily search for hidden features.

If the thief is equipped with a long pole or similar implement, he can search a 5' radius area within 10' of his location. This can be advantageous because if a trap gets set off, he might be far enough to avoid being harmed. Other rules, bonuses or penalties might apply to the attempt, depending on the thief's tools, the degree of concealment, and other factors.

**Shadowy Senses:** Since the bright light of torches will reveal their positions, thieves learn to rely on superior night-vision, keen hearing and smell, and echolocation to slowly scout through dark alleys, lightless dungeons, and star-lit rooftops. When moving at combat speed or exploration speed, a thief can "see" as if he were carrying a light source that sheds dim light in a 30' radius. Shadowy senses can be used to fight, probe for traps, and so on. However, shadowy senses cannot be used to discern colors, faces, markings, or flat images (such as frescoes and murals), or to read books, maps, or scrolls. Shadowy senses does not function if the thief is charging or running, if deafened, or if in an area of bright light, magical darkness, or magical silence. Because it counts as dim light, an opponent can hide from shadowy senses.

**Sneaking:** Thieves learn to prowl with great stealth. A thief can begin sneaking as a movement action. He can sneak at his encounter speed or one-half combat speed without penalty. If he moves greater than one-half combat speed, he takes a -5 penalty to the Sneaking proficiency throw. If he runs, he takes a -10 penalty.

When the thief begins sneaking, the Judge must make a Sneaking proficiency throw on behalf of the thief. A thief will always think he is successful in this skill, and will not know otherwise until others react to his presence. Regardless of whether the throw succeeds, opponents encountering the thief suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls if the thief is outside their line of sight.

If the throw succeeds, the thief is also **sneaking**. If the throw fails, the thief is not sneaking. When sneaking, the thief makes no noise when he moves — none whatsoever. Even alert creatures that make a successful Listening proficiency throw will not hear a sound. When a sneaking thief engages an unengaged opponent from the rear, the opponent cannot make a free facing change.

**Streetwise:** The thief has learned the hard lessons taught by life as a criminal. He might begin play as a member of a thieves' guild or other criminal syndicate (Judge's discretion). He can engage in hijinks if he has the necessary proficiencies or thief skills. He can automatically identify gestures, signs, slang, and territory of criminal organizations in his home settlement. He can identify those of other urban settlements with a proficiency throw of 11+. Secret organizations or organizations in far-off cities might be harder to recognize. (This class power is equivalent to one rank of Streetwise proficiency.)

**Trapbreaking:** With the aid of thieves' tools, a thief can attempt to disable or discharge a trap harmlessly. A thief can crack traps either hastily or methodically.

* Attempting to hastily disarm a trap requires one round and a Trapbreaking proficiency throw. If the throw succeeds, the trap is disarmed or discharged harmlessly (thief's choice). If it fails on a natural roll of 1 – 3, the thief accidentally triggers the trap. If it fails on any other result, the thief cannot figure out how to quickly disable the trap. He can still attempt to disable it methodically, but cannot make another attempt to hastily remove the same trap again until he reaches a higher experience level.
* Attempting to methodically disarm a trap requires one turn (10 minutes) and a Trapbreaking proficiency throw with a +4 bonus. If the throw succeeds, the trap is disarmed or discharged harmlessly. If it fails on a natural roll of 1, the thief accidentally triggers the trap. If it fails on any other result, the thief is unable to disable the trap. The thief can make repeated attempts to methodically remove the same trap if desired.

Other bonuses or penalties might apply to the proficiency throw, depending on the thief's tools, the complexity of the trap, and other factors.

## Additional Class Powers

When they advance in level, thieves gain the following additional class powers:

**Deciphering (4th level):** The thief gains the ability to decipher text(including ciphers, treasure maps, and dead languages, but not magical writings). Deciphering a page of text requires one turn (10 minutes) and a successful proficiency throw of 4+ on 1d20. If the roll does not succeed, the thief cannot try to decipher that particular page of text until he reaches a higher level of experience.

**Hideout (9th level):** By acquiring a **hideout** worth at least 5,000gp, the thief can attract followers to his service. 2d6 1st level thieves will arrive to serve him as followers within 1d4 weeks of him acquiring the hideout. If the thief already has a hideout, the followers arrive to serve him within 1d4 weeks of him reaching 9th level. If hired, the followers must be paid standard rates for ruffians. These followers will serve the character with some loyalty, though at least one will be an infiltrator working for the thief's local rivals, sent to keep an eye on the character. A cunning and resourceful thief can use these followers to start a criminal syndicate. Additional rules for hideouts and syndicates are detailed in the **Campaigns** chapter (p. XX).

**Scrollreading (10th):** The thief gains the ability to read and cast magic from arcane and divine scrolls. The thief does not have to be able to read the language in which the scroll is written provided he has successfully deciphered it before. Reading a magical scroll requires one round and a successful proficiency throw of 4+ on 1d20. However, a failed throw means the spell does not function as expected, and can create a horrible effect at the Judge's discretion.

## Class Proficiencies

**Proficiency Progression:** At 1st level, thieves select one class proficiency from their class proficiency list and one general proficiency from the general proficiency list. They select an additional class proficiency at 4th, 8th, and 12th level. They select an additional general proficiency at 5th, 9th, and 13th level.
