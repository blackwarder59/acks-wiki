## Combat Characteristics

Paladins are elite warriors blessed by divine power. They are trained in all forms of combat and are among the most capable fighters in any army. Their divine blessing enhances their natural combat abilities.

**Combat Proficiencies:** Paladins have weapon proficiency with all weapons. They have armor proficiency with light, medium, and heavy armor, and with shields. They have fighting style proficiency with weapon and shield fighting and two-handed weapon fighting.

**Combat Progression:** Paladins advance in attack throws and saving throws as fighters, by two points every three levels of experience. Paladins increase their base damage roll from successful missile and melee attacks by +1 at 1st level and by an additional +1 at 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th level. They can cleave after killing a foe a maximum of once per round per class level.

## Magic

Paladins are limited divine spellcasters who receive their magic directly from their patron deity as a reward for their unwavering devotion. Their magic focuses on healing, protection, and destroying evil.

**Spell Acquisition:** Paladins acquire spells through prayer and meditation. They do not use spell books. All paladin spells of the appropriate level are considered to be "known" by the paladin and he need not select them individually. Paladins cannot cast spells until they reach 9th level.

**Spell Slots:** A paladin's spell-casting ability is summarized on the **Paladin Spell Progression** table. That table shows the number of spell slots available at each class level, according to the level of the spell. A 9th level paladin can cast one 1st level spell per day, while a 14th level paladin can cast three 1st level spells, two 2nd level spells, and two 3rd level spells per day.

**Spell Casting:** Paladins can cast spells while wearing any armor and using shields, as their divine blessing overcomes such restrictions. Paladins may cast spells from a spell scroll of divine spells, regardless of class, with a proficiency throw of 10+ (adding the spell level to this throw).

**Spell List:** The list of spells available to paladins can be found at the end of this chapter.

**Restoring Magic:** Paladins regain their ability to cast spells through prayer and meditation. They must spend at least 4 hours in prayer to recover their spell slots.

## Starting Class Powers

At the start of play, paladins have the class powers below:

**Detect Evil:** A paladin can detect evil creatures, objects, or locations by concentrating for one round. This ability functions as the 1st level spell detect evil, but can be used at will. The range is 60 feet, and the paladin can determine the direction of the evil source but not its exact location unless he can see it.

**Divine Favor:** Paladins serve specific deities and can gain divine favor for their devout service. A paladin begins play with 2d6 points of divine favor with his patron deity. Additional rules for divine favor can be found in the **Campaigns** chapter.

**Divine Health:** Paladins are blessed with resistance to disease and poison. They are immune to all forms of disease (though not magical diseases such as mummy rot or lycanthropy). They gain a +2 bonus to saving throws against poison.

**Lay on Hands:** Once per day, a paladin can heal wounds by laying his hands on a creature. This heals 2 points of damage per paladin level. Alternatively, the paladin can use this ability to cure disease or neutralize poison, but doing so uses up the healing for that day.

**Protection from Evil:** A paladin radiates an aura of protection in a 10' radius. This aura functions as the 1st level spell protection from evil, affecting all allies within range. The aura moves with the paladin and is always active.

**Turn Undead:** Paladins can channel divine power to drive away or destroy undead creatures. This ability functions as a crusader's turn undead ability, using the paladin's class level -2. See the **Crusader** class description for complete rules on turning undead.

## Additional Class Powers

When they advance in level, paladins gain the following additional class powers:

**Immunity to Fear (3rd level):** The paladin becomes immune to all forms of fear, magical and otherwise.

**Immunity to Disease (5th level):** The paladin becomes immune to all diseases, including magical diseases such as mummy rot and lycanthropy.

**Weapons of Disruption (7th level):** All melee weapons wielded by the paladin are treated as weapons of disruption when fighting undead or evil outsiders. Against such creatures, the weapons deal +1d6 damage and force a saving throw vs. death on any successful hit. If the save fails, the creature is destroyed.

**Stronghold (9th level):** By acquiring a **stronghold** worth at least 20,000gp, the paladin can attract followers to serve him. 2d6 1st level fighters, 1d6 1st level crusaders, and 1d3 1st level paladins will arrive to serve him within 1d4 weeks of him acquiring the stronghold. If the paladin already has a stronghold, the followers arrive within 1d4 weeks of him reaching 9th level. If hired, the followers must be paid standard rates for henchmen. These followers will serve the character with absolute loyalty as long as he maintains his lawful good alignment. A righteous paladin can use his stronghold to protect the innocent, fight evil, and build a power base for good. Additional rules for strongholds are detailed in the **Campaigns** chapter.

## Class Proficiencies

**Proficiency Progression:** At 1st level, paladins select one class proficiency from their class proficiency list and one general proficiency from the general proficiency list. They select an additional class proficiency at 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th level. They select an additional general proficiency at 5th, 9th, and 13th level.

**Paladin Proficiency List:** Alertness, Armor Training, Beast Training, Ceremonial Magic, Combat Reflexes, Command, Diplomacy, Fighting Style Specialization, Healing, Intimidation, Language, Leadership, Lore, Riding, Theology, Weapon Focus, Weapon Specialization

## Paladin Code

All paladins must follow a strict code of conduct:

1. **Lawful Good Alignment:** A paladin must maintain lawful good alignment at all times. Any action that shifts the paladin's alignment causes immediate loss of all paladin abilities until atonement is made.

2. **Honor:** A paladin must act with honor in all dealings. He cannot lie, cheat, or use poison.

3. **Courage:** A paladin must never refuse a reasonable request for aid from a lawful good person.

4. **Protection:** A paladin must protect the innocent and defend the weak.

5. **Justice:** A paladin must punish those who harm or threaten innocents.

6. **Associates:** A paladin may only adventure with good-aligned characters. He may work with neutral characters temporarily if the cause is just, but may never knowingly associate with evil characters.

7. **Wealth:** A paladin may not retain more treasure than he needs to support himself and his followers. Excess wealth must be donated to worthy causes or his church.
