## Dwarven Craftpriest

Key Attribute: WIL

Requirements: CON 9

Hit Dice: 1d6

Maximum Level: 10

Nothing is so revered among the dwarven people as craftsmanship. A dwarf's work is his life, and the spirits of great dwarven artisans are believed to live on forever in their masterpieces. The veneration of these relics falls to the care of a caste of dwarves known as craftpriests. While most craftpriests attend to the shrines and monuments of their clan, young craftpriests are sometimes sent forth to recover monuments to the glorious past from the ancient ruins and wastelands of the world.

### Combat Characteristics

Craftpriests have some combat training in the traditional weapons of their people, but not as much as their warrior-kin, the vaultguards.

**Combat Proficiencies:** Craftpriests have weapon proficiency with all axes (including battle axes, great axes, and hand axes) and all bludgeons (including clubs, flails, maces, morning stars, and warhammers). They have armor proficiency with all armor. They have fighting style proficiency with the weapon and shield and two-handed weapon styles, but not with the dual weapon style.

**Combat Progression:** Craftpriests advance in attack throws and saving throws as crusaders, by two points every four levels of experience. They do not gain any bonus to damage as they advance in level. They can cleave after killing a foe a maximum of once per round per every two class levels (rounded down).

### Starting Class Powers

At the start of play, craftpriests have the following class powers.

**Attention to Detail:** Craftpriests gain a +3 bonus on proficiency throws for any proficiencies they learn. (This bonus has already been factored into the craftpriest's class abilities.)

**Crafting:** Every craftpriest is a master in a particular type of craft, such as armor-making, leatherworking, weapon-smithing, etc. With access to craftsman's tools, craftpriests can produce 40gp worth of items per month and supervise 2 journeymen and 4 apprentices in their craft. When examining works of his craft, craftpriests can identify masterwork items, rare materials, and famous artisans with a proficiency throw of 2+ on 1d20. (This class power is equivalent to three ranks of Craft proficiency.)

**Rebuke Undead:** Craftpriests can rebuke undead as crusaders of their class level (p. XX). In order to rebuke undead, they must be equipped with a holy symbol representing the ancestor or relic they venerate.

**Studious Divine Magic:** By invoking the rites and rituals of their venerable ancestors, craftpriests can cast divine spells. Unlike most other divine casters, who receive their spells from prayer, craftpriests receive their spells from study. Craftpriests follow the same spell progression and use the same rules for learning and casting spells as mages. They record their repertoires of spells in spell books and can learn new spells from scribing scrolls or studying other divine spell books. They select their spells from the divine spell list, rather than the arcane spell list, however, and cannot learn or cast spells found in arcane spell books. See p. XX for more details on studious divine spellcasting.

**Theology:** Craftpriests are trained in the rites and rituals of the dwarven faith and are broadly knowledgeable about other races' and cultures' religions. They can acquire congregants through proselytizing. They can automatically identify religious symbols, trappings, and holy days of the dwarven faith, and recognize those of other faiths with a proficiency throw of 8+ on 1d20. (This class power is equivalent to one rank of Theology proficiency.)

### Additional Class Powers

When they advance in level, craftpriests gain the following additional class powers:

**Minor Magical Research (5th level):** The craftpriest can research spells, scribe scrolls, and brew potions.

**Major Magical Research (9th level):** The craftpriest can create permanent magic items, such as weapons, rings, and staffs. He can also craft magical constructs such as golems.

**Vault (9th level):** By acquiring a **vault** worth at least 15,000gp, the craftpriest can attract dwarves to his service. 1d4+1 x 10 dwarven mercenaries and 1d6 dwarven craftpriests of 1st – 3rd level arrive to serve him as followers within 1d3 months of him acquiring the vault. If the craftpriest has already acquired a vault, the followers arrive to serve him within 1d3 months of him reaching 9th level. The craftpriest must pay his followers the ordinary rates for mercenaries and henchmen or they leave his service. Additional rules for vaults are detailed in the **Campaigns** chapter (p. XX).

### Racial Traits

As dwarves, craftpriests have certain powers and drawbacks associated with their race.

**Dwarf Tongues:** Dwarves can speak the Common and Dwarvish tongues and, because of their frequent interaction underground with beastmen, can also speak Goblin, Gnome, and Kobold.

**Hardy:** Dwarves are tough. The target values for all their Blast saving throws are improved by 3, while the target values for all their other saving throws are improved by 4. (These adjustments are already factored into the saving throws on the Dwarven Craftpriest Attack and Saving Throws table below.)

**Sensitivity to Rock and Stone:** Dwarves gain a +1 bonus to surprise rolls when underground. When using Adventuring proficiency to search or listen, they succeed on a proficiency throw of 14+ (instead of the usual 18+). If separately proficient in Searching they gain a +4 bonus to their throw instead. If separately proficient in Listening, they gain a +2 bonus to their throw instead.

### Code of Behavior

Every dwarven craftpriest must uphold the strictures of the sacred order to which he belongs. The particular strictures that any given craftpriest follows can vary depending on his clan and vault, but most obey the following strictures:

* The craftpriest must always display a holy symbol indicating the relic he venerates somewhere on his person when in public.
* The craftpriest must sing hymns on high holy days each week. Singing hymns requires one hour of ancillary activity.
* The craftpriest must only use the traditional weapons of the dwarves.
* If the craftpriest discovers a dwarven relic in the hands of outsiders, he must recover the relic by any means necessary. If he has guardianship of a dwarven relic, he must protect the relic even at the cost of his own life. If he loses the relic, he must recover it from the one who took it, or take everything else from him – or his descendants.
* The craftpriest must not use his divine magic to harm or hinder fellow dwarves, unless ordered to do so by a superior during a time when his vault is at war with another vault.

If a craftpriest ever violates the strictures of his order, the ancestral spirits he venerates might impose penalties upon him. These penalties are entirely up to the Judge and might include penalties to turning throws, a reduction in spells available, or even a loss of all class powers altogether. To remove the penalties, the craftpriest will have to atone for his violation by, e.g., sacrificing treasure, undertaking quests, or even receiving an **atonement** spell from a powerful caster of his order (Judge's discretion).

For more information on the customs and traditions of the craftpriest, see the sourcebook *By This Axe: The Cyclopedia of Dwarven Civilization*.

**Notes:** The Craft proficiency that each craftpriest template begins with is noted in bold. For an explanation of caste, see ***By This Axe***. Some characters of this class have above average Intellect, and the templates above reflect that. Each template assumes that the character has an INT attribute of between 13 and 15, qualifying him for one bonus proficiency and one bonus spell. The bonus proficiency and bonus spell that each template begins with are noted last. For characters with INT of less than 13 or greater than 15, see the **Intellect Scores of Studious Spellcasters** section earlier in this Chapter.
