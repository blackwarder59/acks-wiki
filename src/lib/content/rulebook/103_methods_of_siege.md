## Methods of Siege

| **Sieges Without Maps:** If you do not have a map for a besieged stronghold, you can estimate a stone stronghold’s shp by dividing the stronghold or urban settlement’s gp value by 10 and rounding up. This is not an exact calculus, but it will serve for most castles and fortified towns.  EXAMPLE: When the Judge prepared his campaign setting, he decided Moruvai’s stronghold was worth 185,000gp, but he never mapped it out. Based on the stronghold value, he estimates that Moruvai’s stronghold has about (185,000 / 10) 18,500 shp.  Structural hit points can be used to estimate the number of troops that can garrison a stronghold. For every 1,000 shp, a stronghold can be defended by 1 unit (rounded up).  EXAMPLE: With 24,000 shp, Moruvai’s stronghold can be defended by (24,000 / 1,000) 24 units.  Wooden strongholds have 1/10th the shp of a stone stronghold, but comparable unit capacity. |

There are three basic methods of capturing strongholds. In a **blockade**, the besieging army encircles the besieged stronghold with its forces to deny re-supply and escape. In a **reduction**, the besieging army deploys bombardment and siege-mines to destroy the stronghold. In an **assault**, the besieging army attacks the stronghold directly to capture it with force of arms.

A besieger may employ one, some, or all of these methods. Most commonly, the besieging army will begin with blockade and then move on to reduction. Only if a stronghold has still refused to capitulate will the besieging army resort to assault. Most sieges end before progressing to an assault, but they are generally conducted as ifthey will end with an assault, if only to intimidate the defender into surrendering.

The sequence of siege tactics can vary considerably, however, with methods overlapping or repeating as necessary. A besieger might immediately attempt an assault, hoping for a quick victory, and only then begin blockade and reduction when the initial assault fails. It might then resume bombardment, only to assault again upon learning that a relief force is on its way.
