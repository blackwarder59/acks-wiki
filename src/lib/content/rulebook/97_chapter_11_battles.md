# Chapter 11: Battles

When two opposing armies move into the same hex, a **battle** might result. In ***ACKS II****,* battles are resolved either with a streamlined resolution system (provided in this rulebook) or by pitching a battle on a tabletop **battlemap** (discussed in the ***Domains at War: Battles***sourcebook, available separately ). The battle system in this rulebook is intended to quickly resolve engagements between armies commanded by NPC rulers. The system can also be employed for PC-on-NPC battles, or even to pit different PCs against each other, if the Judge prefers a more abstract resolution.

Once the outcome of a battle is resolved, the defeated force may be pursued or **besieged**. The victor will earn the **spoils of war** and have the opportunity to **occupy**, **conquer**,and/or **pillage** the domain of the enemy.

When two opposing armies are in the same 6-mile hex, a **battle** might occur. To determine whether a battle occurs, first the Judge identifies the **state of awareness**. The three possible states are **mutual awareness**, **mutual unawareness**, or **unilateral awareness**.

The state of awareness depends on whether the various armies have located each other through reconnaissance rolls. If both armies have located each other, the state is one of **mutual awareness**. If neither army has located the other, the state is one of **mutual unawareness**. If just one army has located the other, the state is **unilateral awareness**.

Once the state of awareness is known, the Judge finds the appropriate **State of Awareness** table, below. Cross index the two army’s **strategic stances** (p. XX) to find the resulting **strategic situation**. Some strategic situations will result in a battle.

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Mutual Awareness** | | | |
| **Army A’s** | **Army B’s Stance** | | |
| **Stance** | *Offensive* | *Defensive* | *Evasive* |
| *Offensive* | Pitched Battle | Pitched Battle | Rear Guard Action |
| *Defensive* | Pitched Battle | No Battle | No Battle |
| *Evasive* | Rear Guard Action | No Battle | No Battle |

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Mutual Unawareness** | | | |
| **Army A’s** | **Army B’s Stance** | | |
| **Stance** | *Offensive* | *Defensive* | *Evasive* |
| *Offensive* | Meeting Engagement | Meeting Engagement | Skirmish |
| *Defensive* | Meeting Engagement | No Battle | No Battle |
| *Evasive* | Skirmish | No Battle | No Battle |

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Unilateral Awareness** | | | |
| **Army A’s** | **Army B’s Stance (Unaware)** | | |
| **Stance (Aware)** | *Offensive* | *Defensive* | *Evasive* |
| *Offensive* | Deep Envelopment | Envelopment | Rear Guard Envelopment |
| *Defensive* | Ambush | No Battle | No Battle |
| *Evasive* | No Battle | No Battle | No Battle |

Note that when indexing results on the tables above, the two opposing armies are always designated “Army A” and “Army B.” In states of mutual awareness and mutual unawareness, the designation is arbitrary. In states of unilateral awareness, the aware army is Army A, and the unaware army is Army B.
