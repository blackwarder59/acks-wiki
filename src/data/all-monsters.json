    "description": "The giant acanthaspis, also known as the giant assassin bug, is a horrific predator with a taste for fresh meat. When full grown, it measures about 10' long and weighs about 800 lbs, with six legs and a short segmented beak. The beak injects acidic enzymes into the bug’s victims, digesting them from the inside so their liquified innards can be sucked out like milk.",
    "combat": "After killing a victim, the acanthaspis secures the corpse on its glossy black carapace with sticky secretions, wearing its victims as **corpse** **armor.** When first encountered, an acanthaspis will have secured 2d10 corpses to itself. Each corpse can absorb 1hp of damage before being destroyed. It takes 1 turn for an acanthaspis to secure a new corpse to itself.\n\nWhen an acanthaspis successfully bites a creature, the creature struck must make a Paralysis saving throw. If the save succeeds, the attack deals 3d6 {P!} damage but has no other effect. If the save fails, the attack deals 3d6 {P!} damage and the creature is **grabbed**. The acanthaspis immediately injects the grabbed creature with digestive enzymes that deal 1d4 {A!} damage. While the creature remains grabbed, the acanthaspis can use its combat action to automatically deal another 1d4 {A!} damage to the creature each round. Once the acidic damage reduces the grabbed creature to 0 or fewer hp, the acanthaspis immediately sucks out its melted innards, killing it instantly.\n\nIf desperate or frustrated, an acanthaspis can spew a 30’ x 5’ line of **acidic spit**. Any creature in the area of effect must make a Blast saving throw. If the save fails, the creature takes 4d8 {A!} damage. If the save succeeds, it takes half that damage. One such attack depletes the acanthaspis’s acid supply for 6 hours, so it will only spit acid when reduced to fewer than half its hit points or when it has failed to grab an opponent.",
    "ecology": "When acanthaspis are encountered in a wilderness nest, there is a 25% chance per creature that it will have 1d4 eggs buried nearby. Acanthaspis eggs have 1 hp and weigh 4/6 st. Acanthaspis nymphs are rarely found in nests, because the nymphs immediately disperse into the wild after they emerge from their eggs.",

    "description": "Among the most perilous of desert denizens, amphisbaena are the offspring of an escaped sorcerous creation of times gone by, great snakes 30’ long with heads at each end of their sinuous bodies. An amphisbaena winds its intricately-patterned sand-colored body sideways across the sand, each head leading by turn, leaving great twisting tracks in its wake as it seeks prey to sate its appetite. Desert nomads claim the flesh of an amphisbaena is a potent aphrodisiac, and the monsters are frequently hunted for their components.",
    "combat": "An amphisbaena attacks with two **venomous** bites, one from each, dealing 1d4 {!P} damage each. Any creature damaged by an amphisbaena’s bite must make a Death saving throw. If the save fails, the creature dies of poison 1d4+2 turns later.\n\nAn amphisbaena’s heads are rivalrous and actively struggle to keep prey away from the other head. Should both heads latch on to the same target, this can have disastrous consequences. If an amphisbaena successfully attacks the same target with both bites in the same attack routine, the struggle between the two heads **rends** the target for an additional 2d10 {Se!} damage. If this damage reduces the target to 0 hp or less, the target is torn limb from limb and instantly slain. The amphisbaena can cleave after rending a target with whichever bite dealt more damage.\n\nIn addition to biting prey, an amphisbaena can attack by constriction. A successful constriction attack deals 2d8 {B!} damage to the creature and **restrains** it. Thereafter, while the creature remains restrained, the amphisbaena can automatically deal 2d8 {B!} damage on its initiative each round to the restrained creature without having to make an attack throw. Doing so counts as the amphisbaena’s constriction attack.",

Adaptable, implacable, and omnivorous, giant ants are a scourge that can reduce a fertile field or woodland to a wasteland in a day.\n\nLike their diminutive cousins, ants are divided into castes of workers, soldiers, and queens. Workers are about 5' long and weigh about 150 lbs. Soldiers are about 6’ to 7’ long and weigh approximately 250 lbs. Queens are immense, measuring 7’ to 9’ long and weighing about 400 lbs.",
    "combat": "Giant ants are not aggressive unless their nests are invaded. In that case, the ants are automatically Hostile and gain a +4 bonus to morale rolls provided their queen is still alive.\n\nThey use **terrestrial mechanoreception** to sense vibration in the ground over long distances equivalent to line of sight in full daylight. Spells or effects that would ordinarily cause blindness do not affect the ant when its using terrestrial mechanoreception. However, creatures that are flying, levitating, or otherwise not touching the ground are invisible to the sense. Terrestrial mechanoreception can penetrate structures and terrain features.",
    "ecology": "Most giant ants are workers, but for every 5 workers there will be one soldier. When giant ants are encountered in their nest, there will always be one queen guarded by 2d4 additional soldiers. There will also be 3d10 larvae and 2d6 eggs. Larva have AC 4, Spd 150’, HD 2, and attack with 1 bite (1d6 {P}). Eggs have 1 hp and weigh 2/6 st. Roll 1d20 per egg: 1 – queen egg, 2-6 soldier egg, 7+, worker ant egg.",

The fatigue ends if the poison is neutralized or after the creature enjoys 8 hours of restful sleep.\n\nTo aid in ambush, monstrous attercops spin webs in strategic locations around their lairs. They use these webs to entangle victims in their webs in order to capture them and keep them fresh for later consumption. They can also spin a web around a target as a melee attack. If a creature moves into an attercop’s web, or if an attercop succeeds on a webspinning attack throw against a creature, that creature becomes **webbed.**\n\nThe attercop’s **webbed mechanoreception** enables them to “see” any creatures touching their webs.",

Báleygr rejoice in war and bloodshed, and typically carry giant-sized weapons of black metal in each hand, favoring a sword, axe, or mace in one hand and a whip in the other.\n\nSome sages believe that the báleygr were once guardians of the Elemental Sphere of Fire, and that they were turned to darkness by Bel, called the Slaughterprince, the Chthonic god of battle. Others claim they are born of the hates and fears of men, and grow stronger as the world descends into chaos. Whatever their origins, báleygr are fearsome foes who bring ruin to any that stand against them.\n\nBáleygr are as intelligent as they are evil. All báleygr can speak Common and two other languages, often Ancient Zaharan and the local beastman dialect.",

When the báleygr’s aura of elemental fire is active, creatures within 15’ of the báleygr take 1d8 {F!} damage if they begin their initiative in its aura, or move into it on their initiative. When its aura of shrouding smoke is active, the báleygr is hidden by the smoke and any creatures (other than the báleygr) within 25’ of it are **blinded** unless able to discern invisible. The báleygr can have both auras active, if desired.\n\nA báleygr is **dreadful** to confront.A creature which starts its initiative, or moves within, 60’ of a báleygr must make a Paralysis saving throw. If the save succeeds, the creature gains immunity to the effects of every báleygr’s dreadfulness for 1 turn. If the save fails, the creature starts **faltering.** If the creature was already faltering, it becomes **frightened** instead. The faltering or frightened condition ends if removed magically or if the báleygr is destroyed or no longer within 60’. As a báleygr’s dreadful presence is preternatural, it functions even through the obscurement of its aura of shrouding smoke.\n\nIn melee, a báleygr will strike with one of its giant-sized weapons. Targets within 10’ can be attacked with its sword, axe, or mace for 4d6 {W!} damage. More distant targets, up to 30’, can be attacked with its whip for 2d6 {S!} damage. Targets struck by the báleygr’s whip must make successful size-adjusted Paralysis throws or be dragged adjacent to the báleygr.\n\nOccasionally báleygr arm themselves with huge bows, with which they shoot flaming arrows. Báleygr’s bows have twice the range of longbows and deal 4d6 {P!} {F!} damage on a successful attack. A báleygr can cleave with its bow without restriction from the weapon.

It is **resistant** to acidic, bludgeoning, cold, electricity, piercing, seismic, and slashing damage. It possesses **lightless vision** (90’) and **telepathy**, which allows it to communicate with any creatures it encounters. It can be held at bay by *holy circle*and rebuked by a divine caster as an infernal creature. If rebuked, however, it can make a Spells saving throw; if the save succeeds, the báleygr can ignore the effect and cannot be rebuked by that divine caster again.\n\nBáleygr are unholy beings that can be detected with *discern evil*, held at bay by *holy circle* and destroyed with *dispel evil.* If summoned, they can be returned to their home spheres by *counterspell* or *dispel magic*.",

    "id": "beastman",
    "name": "Beastman",
    "description": "Beastmen are the crossbred creations of ancient Zahar, created by ancient magic and enslaved in service to their dark masters. The Zaharans created many breeds of beastmen, sometimes crossing different strains repeatedly in their quest for the perfect living weapon. Six major breeds of beastmen have been identified by the sages of Aura: kobolds, goblins, orcs, hobgoblins, gnolls, and bugbears. The Zaharans also bred ogres and trolls, though the sages of Aura consider them separate species (q.v.).\n\nApart from kobolds, who were bred as pets, the other breeds of beastmen were created to be soldiers for the Zaharan army – ruthless and blood-thirsty, but susceptible to control by a powerful leader. In the absence of an external authority (such as a Zaharan sorcerer-king), beastmen organize themselves into bands of loosely-related gangs ruled by a chieftain. Endemic warfare between nearby bands is constant, until eventually one of the chieftains succeeds in unifying the bands into a clan under his rule. Born of evil magic, there is nothing redeemable about beastmen, and every Auran missionary who has ever attempted to find good in them has ended up dying painfully and being eaten.\n\nIsolated bands usually have no permanent home, living a nomadic existence that follows seasonably available wild plants and game. Nomadic beastmen dwell in tents made from animal hides sewn together or woven hair wrapped around wooden poles. These tents are usually small, but can be as large as thirty feet in diameter. Less fortunate nomads may just take shelter where they can find it. Nomadic beastmen survive by hunting wildlife, gathering wild forage, and raiding civilized settlements. Roving bands are often composed of only males, their females having been lost to stronger rivals.\n\nEstablished beastman clans tend to permanently or semi-permanently dwell in ruins, caves, captured strongholds, or villages. Beastmen in villages generally live in roundhouses constructed of whatever materials are at hand. In wet, wooded climates, roundhouses with timber or wattle-and-daub walls and thatched roofs will dominate. In other terrain, the walls are constructed of mudbrick or stone, mortared with sand, soil, and dung, while the roof covering is of woven hair or animal-hide, sewn to short spars. Stone-lined pits are dug for iron forges, kilns, food storage, and waste.\n\nSometimes the buildings are gathered to form a ring fort or hill-fort, surrounded by ditches, moats, earthen ramparts or piled stone walls. The skulls of dead foes frequently adorn these defenses.\n\nWhen settled, beastmen clans practice horticulture, cultivating small plots of mixed crops using hand tools. Beastmen care nothing for crop rotation or soil sustainability, and will simply burn or cut away a clearing, then farm it until the soil is exhausted. It is not uncommon to find large tracts of exhausted scrub around beastmen settlements. In arid terrain, they may herd goats, sheep, cows, pigs, and other livestock that can graze on the scant vegetation. Beastmen tribes that have captured many prisoners in raids may have slave laborers working farms, but these are usually short-lived; beastmen do not breed or care for their slaves, and simply eat those that die.\n\nFamily relations are brutal; beastmen males are considerably larger than the females, whom they dominate. Both sexes lack any capacity whatsoever for compassion, empathy, kindness, or love. High-status males maintain large harems, within which the females compete for provision and protection. Low-status males have no chance to mate at all, except by gaining status through violence or subterfuge. As a result, beastmen males typically spend much of their time fighting, hunting, and raiding. More than half die from wounds sustained in such activities before middle age.\n\nBeastmen care little for their prepubescent children, feeding them scraps and often exiling them to the edges of the camp fires. Many whelps die of exposure or under-nourishment, leaving just the toughest and most cunning to survive to adulthood, usually by murdering their siblings.\n\nBeastmen who lack the size and temperament to serve as warriors are known as drudges, and are forced to handle all of the chores the warriors refuse to do, such as farming, foraging, cooking, and camping. Most of these drudges are females, but some are males who through disability, injury, or other reasons are unable to serve as warriors.\n\nThe drudges also craft blankets, clothing, furniture, tools, and shelter from the woven hair of sheep and goats, or the leather, bone, sinew, and hide of animals. Indeed, of the crafts, only metal-working is the province of warriors, and it is typically limited to working wrought iron in pit-furnaces. Knowledge of weapon- and armor-smithing is rare, with only a handful of smiths in a tribe. Knowledge is handed down orally within families, and blood feuds lasting generations can simmer between rival families.\n\nBeastmen speak a number of distinct languages, each of which is a barely-recognizable dialect of Ancient Zaharan. A beastman warrior has a 10% chance of speaking Common. A beastman champion, chief, shaman, sub-chieftain, or witch doctor has a 10% chance per HD of speaking Common.",

Civilized adults, living in the safe realms of Law, may dismiss cacodemons as mere myths and legends, but the learned must endure the terror of knowing they are real.\n\nCacodemons range in power from chaotic spawn, no more fearsome than a gnoll, to archfiends capable of destroying dragons. Demonologists have codified this range into ten different **ranks**. Many of a cacodemon’s characteristics primarily depend on its rank. See the Cacodemon Characteristics by Rank tables, below.\n\nThe appearance of cacodemons varies as much as their power. Some occultists argue that cacodemons have no true body form, and that it is the summoner’s will which imposes shape upon their formless souls. Others argue that as creatures of Chaos, cacodemons come in every body form imaginable. Whatever the case, a cacodemon’s speed and attack routine are determined by its **body form**, while its damage is determined by the intersection of its rank and body form. See the Cacodemon Characteristics by Body Form table, below.\n\nCacodemons are **resistant** to acidic, cold, electrical, fire, poisonous, and seismic damage. They have **lightless vision** (90’) and possess **telepathy** (as the spell) allowing them to communicate with any creatures they encounter. In addition, all cacodemons have at least two other special abilities, one of them often derived from their body form. High-ranking cacodemons may have as many as five special abilities. Refer to the Cacodemon Characteristics by Rank table for the number of special abilities the cacodemon receives. Winged cacodemons lose one special ability to compensate for flight.\n\nSome cacodemons are capable of speech. The higher the rank of the cacodemon, the greater the probability that it has the capability of speech. Refer to the Cacodemon Characteristics by Rank table for the probability of speech. All cacodemons that can speak know Common and two other languages.\n\nCacodemons that speak can also cast arcane spells at a caster level of ½ their HD. The arcane spells per day available is determined by the cacodemon’s rank. Cacodemons always know the same number of arcane spells that they can cast per day. Their repertoire is innate and they have no need for spell formula or studying.\n\nDifferent cacodemons favor different types of spells, but enchantments such as *dark whispers, incite madness, infuriate beast, inspire horror,* and *enslave*are common.\n\nCacodemons that can speak and cast spells should be counted as having two additional special abilities (\\*\\*) for purposes of XP. (This is already factored into the HD entry and XP awards for Fiends and Archfiends, which always can speak and cast spells). If all cacodemons are unintelligent creatures incapable of speech in the Judge’s campaign setting, then cacodemons who would be capable of speech should gain an additional two special abilities instead. Cacodemons will not cast spells when conjured or summoned unless they are Fiends or Archfiends.\n\nWhatever their special abilities, cacodemons are unholy beings that can be detected with *discern evil*, held at bay by *holy circle,* dispelled with *counterspell* or *dispel magic,* destroyed with *dispel evil,* and rebuked as infernals.",

    "description": "For centuries, the Zaharans interred their mummified lords in peaceful *torpor* to await the Awakening. In the closing days of the Empyrean War, it became clear that this stately tradition was under terrible threat. When great Suhgurim, prince of ruinguards, was felled at the fields of Morgot by his half-brother Valerian, even the sorcerer-king Sebek was forced to admit that defeat was at hand. Violating a millennium of tradition, Sebek ordered that Suhgurim and his other fallen ruinguards be raised as fearsome undead of a type never created before or since: death knights. To be made a death knight was to be doomed to an eternity of suffering. Bound forever into irremovable plate armor, denied all the pleasures of life, the death knights were also forbidden the peace of *torpor*. Instead, they were sent straight back onto the battlefields, undead juggernauts whose hatred for their own horrific existence was matched only by their enmity for the Empyrean crusaders who had destroyed their birthright.\n\nThe *Fourth Book of the Empyrean War,* part of the *Seven Radiant Scrolls,* claims that all of the death knights were destroyed when Zahar was sacked. But the realm of Zahar was vast and its necromancy mighty …",
    "combat": "All death knights have a **horrific** **visage**. When a creature first beholds one or more undead with this power, and at the start of each round thereafter that it continues to do so, the creature must make a Paralysis saving throw. The save suffers a -1 penalty per additional horrifying undead after the first. If the save fails, the creature is **cowering** until the start of the next round. If the save succeeds, the creature gains immunity to the effects of every undead’s horrific visage for 1 turn.\n\nEvery death knight was once a 12th level Zaharan Ruinguard. It possess all the class powers and proficiencies it had in life. However, these powers are magnified by its undead status. Anytime a death knight uses its **arcane striking** power, all of the damage dealt by the arcane strike becomes **enervating**, such that it permanently reduces the target’s maximum hp by the amount of damage dealt.\n\nIf the creature’s hp are reduced to 0, the creature is slain. If not slain, the creature becomes **enervated**.If a creature is slain by the enervating touch or enervated condition, it cannot be restored to life save by ritual magic*.* One day after the creature dies, it manifests as a **haunt** somewhere within 300’ of where it died (see p. XX).\n\nThe death knight’s irremovable armor grants it a 15 AC and makes it **immune** to enchantment effects, to necrotic and poisonous damage, and to all mundane damage. It is **resistant** to extraordinary bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. As undead, death knights are inherently evil for purposes of *discern evil*and *holy circle*spells.

    "name": "Dragon",
    "description": "Dragons are an ancient and dangerous reptilian species, capable of surviving for thousands of years, growing in size and power with each passing century. Throughout Aurëpos, they are held in awe and terror as living embodiments of avarice, gluttony, and wrath.\n\nDragons come in an astounding variety of body forms, colors, and powers. The Tower of Knowledge claims that dragons are elemental creatures whose very bodies adapt to whatever **habitat** they choose to lair in. Whatever the case, a dragon’s color and its breath weapon (if any) usually reflect the terrain and climate of their habitats, and dragons are often grouped into general categories on this basis. For instance, dragons that dwell in frigid tundra will often have white hides and freezing breath weapons, earning the name white dragons. See the Dragon Characteristics by Habitat table.\n\nDragons grow in power with **age**. A spawn will be no more powerful than a wolf, but a venerable dragon that has lived many centuries will possess titanic power. Many of a dragon’s characteristics primarily depend on its age, shown on the Dragon Characteristics by Age tables, below. To determine the age of a dragon randomly, roll 1d20! and multiply the result by 5. Determine the number of dragons encountered after determining the age. If two dragons are encountered, they will be a mated pair (if adult or older) or siblings (if juvenile or younger). If three or more dragons are encountered, they will be a mated pair (adults or older) along with their offspring. Determine the age of the offspring in years by rolling 1d10 x 5. Roll separately for treasure for each dragon by age.\n\nA dragon’s speed and attack routine are determined by its **body form**, while its damage per attack is determined by the intersection of its age and body form. A dragon’s natural weapons deal extraordinary damage regardless of its age. Dragons come in four basic body forms, each of which has winged and wingless variants, for a total of eight possibly body form configurations. To determine a dragon’s body form randomly, roll 1d12. 1 - wingless guivre; 2 – winged guivre; 3 – wingless lindworm; 4 – winged lindworm. 5 – wingless wyvern; 6 – winged wyvern; 7 – 9 – wingless drake; 10 – 12 – winged drake. See the Dragon Characteristics by Body Form table, below.\n\nAll dragons have one special ability derived from their body form and at least one other special ability. As they age, dragons become increasingly powerful and gain additional special abilities. Winged dragons gain **clutching claws** along with flight, but pick one less special ability to compensate. Refer to the Secondary Dragon Attributes table for the number of special abilities the dragon should receive.\n\nSome dragons are capable of speech. The older the dragon, the greater the probability that it has the capability of speech. Refer to the Dragon Characteristics by Rank table for the probability of speech. All dragons that can speak know Common, Draconic, and one other language per age category.\n\nDragons that can speak can also cast arcane spells at a caster level of ½ their HD. The arcane spells per day available is determined by the dragon’s age. Dragons always know the same number of arcane spells that they can cast per day. Their repertoire is innate and they have no need for spell formula or studying.\n\nDragons that can speak and cast spells should be counted as having one additional special ability (\\*) for purposes of XP. (This is already factored into the HD entry and XP awards for Ancient and Venerable dragons, which always can speak and cast spells). If dragons are always unintelligent creatures incapable of speech in the Judge’s campaign setting, then Ancient and Venerable dragons should be assigned an additional special ability instead.",

A brownie labors nightly when the householders are asleep, invisibly performing menial chores such as cleaning away spider webs, sweeping the floor, and stacking hay bales. They avoid contact with the folks they aid, and dwell within unused areas of the house or farm. In exchange for their help, brownies expect small gifts of food, delighting in milk, cream, butter, honey, and porridge.\n\nFailure in this tribute, idleness on the part of the people they support, taking their assistance for granted, lavish gifting, or worse – insisting that the tribute given is payment or wage – enrages these faeries.\n\nAn enraged brownie becomes Chaotic in alignment, and is called a boggart. A boggart will use its invisibility and great strength to punish the family. It will break items, set loose or attack livestock, torment children and pets, steal and hide needed tools and implements, and in some cases assault and injure those responsible, until finally fleeing to another habitation where it feels its help is more welcome.\n\nBrownies are found in the northern shores of Aurëpos, particularly in Northern Argollë, Jutland, and Rorn. Though some dwell in Southern Argollë, they are otherwise very rare in the south, where nymphs rather than faeries reign.\n\nThey speak the lilting language of faeries and the languages spoken by dwarves, elves, and humans of their region.",

The children remember their old life dimly as if a dream, which fades with time.\n\nNo brownie would ever steal a child from loving parents, but some boggarts have been known to do so – which has contributed much to the fear with which they are held.\n\n![](data:image/png;base64...)",

    "description": "2’ tall old men with exaggerated features and large eyes, knockers are mine faeries dwelling deep within the earth. They invariably carry picks, hammers, and shovels with which they excavate and dig for metals and minerals. They bear no ill will towards dwarves and human miners as they encounter, though they are loathe to reveal themselves directly.\n\nIndeed, given gifts of surface food and praises, knockers will warn the delvers of other folk of impending danger by loudly knocking on the rocks and tunnel walls nearby. Like most faeries, however, they are not above minor practical jokes.\n\nKnockers are found primarily in Jutting Mountains. Because knockers possess powerful magic to delve the depths of the earth, many of the Jutting jarls have sought to enlist the aid of knockers for their great works; all such attempts have ended in disaster for the dwarves. Knockers are very rare in the Meniri Mountains, where nymphs predominate, and the Meniri dwarves insist knockers are just a wild superstition of their uncivilized brethren.\n\nKnockers speak the lilting language of faeries and the languages spoken by the local dwarves, gnomes, and kobolds.",
    "combat": "While not invisible, knockers are **naturally stealthy** when underground. Creatures encountering them suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls.\n\nKnockers can use *earthen mire* once per hour as a spell-like ability, which they use to aid in delving for ore.",
    "ecology": "Knockers dwell in vaults like dwarves – but their vaults are always curiously “off,” as if they were delved in imitation of the dwarven vaults but without an understanding of their function.\n\nLike brownies, knockers do not count women or children of any sort as part of their number. They reproduce by transforming abandoned, orphaned, and/or unloved dwarven, goblin, gnomish, or kobold children into their own kind in magic rituals performed in places of power on holy days. The children remember their old life dimly as if a dream., which fades with time.\n\nKnockers never steal children from loving dwarven or gnomish parents, but consider all beastmen whelps to be unloved. When the deep tunnels begin to reverberate with knocks, beastmen breeders know to keep their whelps in hand.",
    "spoils": "A knocker vault will always be located near an ore deposit. See *By This Axe* p. XX for rules on ore deposits.\n\nA slain knocker can be harvested with Healing 1 for the following component:\n\n* eyes (1/6 st, 13gp, *lightless vision, locate treasure, shrinking*)\n\n![](data:image/png;base64...)",

    "description": "These water faeries stand 4’ tall and look like beautiful elfin-featured men or women, the former called a nix, the latter a nixie. Their flawless skin is pale with just the slightest silvery sheen, and their expressive eyes are ever-shifting shades of blue. As mercurial as the waters they inhabit, they can be by turns helpful or vicious as the whim takes them.\n\nNixies are found in the northern shores of Aurëpos, particularly in Northern Argollë, Jutland, and Rorn. Though some dwell in Southern Argollë, they are otherwise very rare in the south, where nymphs rather than faeries reign.\n\nThey speak the lilting language of faeries and the languages spoken by dwarves, elves, and humans of their region.",
    "combat": "The music of the nixies is entrancing and magical. As a full-round action, a nixie can sing an **enthralling song**.Once begun, the song continues until the start of the nixie’s next initiative or until it is slain. While a nixie is singing, each enemy creature within earshot (45’ in normal environments) must make a Spells saving throw at the start of its initiative. If more than one nixie sings, the creature suffers a -2 penalty for each additional nixie in earshot.\n\nIf the saving throw succeeds, the creature gains immunity to the effects of every nixie’s enthralling song until the start of its next initiative. If the saving throw fails, the creature becomes **enthralled**. On its initiative, an enthralled creature will move at combat speed towards the nearest nixie that enthralled it; if within 5’ of the nixie, the creature will remain stationary. The creature cannot take full-round actions, combat actions, or even speak, and is **vulnerable** to the nixies’ attacks. If the creature’s movement brings it into water, it starts **drowning**.\n\nA creature remains enthralled until the effect is dispelled, the nixie is slain, or 6 turns elapse. Nixies enjoy dallying with their enthralled victims during this duration. After a nixie has played with her new “toys” for 1d6 turns she will either release them or draw them into water to drown.\n\nBecause their magic can entrance most threats, nixies rarely fight. If forced to do so, they equip themselves with daggers and other tiny weapons. Nixies can also **skinchange** into the form of a light horse once per day. In this shape they explore the land around their lair, playing tricks on any outsiders they come upon.",
    "ecology": "Waterfalls, pools, gently flowing rivers: these are the places nixies call home. There they while away the hours singing and playing music.\n\nNixies reproduce by breathing life into elven children who have died of drowning. Grieving elven parents will often take the remains of drowned children to a beautiful lagoon or waterfall where nixies are thought to dwell. The transformations require complex magic rituals performed in places of power on holy days.

The elves argue it is clearly due to their sylvan magical heritage, while the dwarves insist it is an outgrowth of traditional dwarven brew-craft. Gnomes are equally famous for their love of pranks, especially alchemical pranks. Many children’s fables warn of hapless victims temporarily besotted by donkeys or turned into mice after accepting “tasty cocktails” from gnomes.\n\nGnomes have a fierce hatred for kobolds and bitter dislike for goblins.

    "description": "The monstrous hellhawk measures 25’ long from head to tail and weighs 1,500 lbs. Its wings, bat-like, with tough and leathery skin stretched between their bones, have a span of 45’. They were crossbred from cacodemons and wyverns by the ancient Zaharans as mounts for their elite ruinguards. Zahar is now a distant memory, but the soul of every hellhawk remains bound by the ancient pacts of their former masters.\n\nHellhawks are semi-sapient. Although incapable of true speech, they can communicate with body posture and vocalizations.",

Living creatures that begin their initiative, or move on their initiative to, within 20’ of a hell-hawk must make a Death saving throw become **queasy** from its overwhelming stench. The condition lasts for 1d4+4 rounds after the character leaves the hell-hawk’s vicinity. Zaharans are immune to the stench.\n\nOnce per hour, a hellhawk can utter a **despairing cry** that inflicts dread and horror on all lawful creatures within earshot (60’ in normal environments). Each creature must make a Paralysis saving throw. The effects depend on the intelligence and power of the creature and the result of their saving throw.\n\nIf the save succeeds, creatures with less than 2 HD start **faltering**, while creatures with 2 or more HD are unaffected. A creature that has already faltered becomes **paralyzed** with dread if further affected. The faltered condition ends if removed magically or if the hell hawk is destroyed or goes out of sight.\n\nIf the save fails, creatures with less than 2 HD drop their weapons and become **paralyzed** with dread, while creatures with 2 HD or more are **paralyzed** with dread until the hell hawk attacks. The paralyzed condition ends if removed magically or if the hellhawk is destroyed or goes out of sight. If a creature’s condition ends because the hell hawk goes out of sight, it must make a new saving throw against the effect when the hell hawk returns to sight. (Once a creature succeeded on its saving throw, it does not need to save again when facing that hell hawk.)",

Always depicted as a dark-skinned human with a scarab beetle as a head, the Khepri is believed to have been a god, an avatar of one of the Chthonic deities. The truth is more terrifying: The khepri was not a god; *they* were a race, the dominant race in Aurëpos in the era before man, their dark rule contested only by their eternal foes, the faravahar (see p. XX). Few khepri survived the devastation of the Day Without Night. Most of the survivors slumber in hidden vaults in remote places. The few khepri that have been roused to action have been great and malevolent actors in Aurëposean history, often serving as prophets and teachers of Chthonic beliefs in order to lay the groundwork for the Awakening.\n\nThe legend of the beetle-headed god arises from the alien appearance of the creatures. A khepri’s torso and limbs resemble those of a tall and muscular jet-black humanoid, but its head is protected by a smooth, shiny black carapace. A crown of chitin extends from the brow of this carapace, while three long mandibular appendages extend like legs from either side of it, the whole resembling a beetle’s body. But it is not. The front portion of the khepri’s carapace consists of segmented plates that can be opened to reveal an utterly inhuman face within, upon which countless khepri larvae squirm and writhe.\n\nKhepri speak their own language, an ancient tongue related to Ancient Zaharan.

All khepri have the ability to use each of the following spell-like abilities at will: *body equilibrium* (like *water walking*, but extending to all loose or unstable surfaces, such as sand), *clairaudience*, *clairvoyance*, *choking grip*, *discern invisible*, *levitation*, and *telepathy***.** Khepri can also *bewitch monster*once per day.\n\nA khepri can open and close its head carapace as a movement action. A khepri’s true face is a **horrifying visage**. Immediately after the carapace is opened, and at the start of each round thereafter until the carapace is closed, each creature beholding the khepri’s true face must make a Paralysis saving throw. The save suffers a -1 penalty per additional khepri after the first. If the save fails, the creature is **cowering** until the start of the next round. If the save succeeds, the creature gains immunity to the effects of every khepri’s horrific visage for 1 turn.\n\nAs a combat action, a khepri can **kiss** an adjacent cowering, helpless, or vulnerable humanoid creature. If the kiss hits, the khepri’s larvae leap onto the unfortunate victim’s face, burrow into his skull via his mouth, nose, and ears, and make their way to his brain. At the end of its next initiative, the victim must make a Death saving throw. If the saving throw fails, the victim dies from shock. If the saving throw succeeds, the victim survives but is **enslaved** to the khepri.\n\nThe larvae can be destroyed (before or after the saving throw) by casting a *cure disease*spell on the victim. Destroying the larvae frees an enslaved victim, but does not revive a slain one. An enslaved victim is also freed if the khepri who kissed him is slain. If the larvae are not destroyed, they will grow inside the victim, feeding on his essence. After 2d4 weeks, the victim will slip into a state of unconsciousness, during which the engorged larvae will weave a cocoon around its head. 72 hours later, the victim must make another Death saving throw. If the save fails, the victim dies. If the save succeeds, the victim will awaken to his new life… as one of the khepri. Once the victim has fallen unconscious, no magic can save him except a *wish*or *miracle*. Death is usually the kinder alternative.",

    "description": "Kraken were created by Lammala, the chthonic goddess of the abyssal depths, in time immemorial. The scourge of the deep, kraken are squid of truly colossal size. Their bodies and mantles reach lengths of 60’, with their cruelly-barbed tentacles, 2 large and 8 smaller, double this length. They weigh as much as 10,000 lbs (5 tons).\n\nThese monstrous beasts take cephalopod intellect to its animal extreme, and while not fully sapient, are nonetheless cunning predators, and will freely attack and devour smaller whales, sharks, giant squids, and other oceanic denizens, as well as boats, sometimes snatching unsuspecting sailors from atop the decks of their vessels.\n\nSome adventurers claim there are kraken lurking in the oceans that have achieved true sapience and serve as cephalopodic tyrants over lesser aquatic creatures. The most learned sages of the Tower of Knowledge consider this unlikely, however.",
    "combat": "Krakens have **acute vision** and **acute olfaction** granting them a +2 bonus to avoid surprise in their native habitat. Their fluid-filled statocysts grant them **aquatic mechanoreception** that enables them to “see” underwater to a range of 270’ (p. XX).\n\nA kraken can attack from up to 90’ away with its tentacles. A kraken’s large tentacles can attack vessels or creatures of huge size or larger. Its smaller tentacles can attack vessels or creatures of any size within reach. As a colossal creature, a kraken deals full structural damage to vessels.\n\nA successful hit with a large tentacle deals 2d20 {B!} damage and **restrains** the creature or vessel. A successful hit with a small tentacles deals 2d12 {B!} damage and, if it struck a creature, **restrains** the creature. Small tentacles cannot restrain vessels.\n\nWhile a creature or vessel is restrained by a large tentacle, the kraken can automatically deal 2d20 {B!} (large tentacle) or 2d12 {B!} (small tentacle) on its initiative each round to the restrained vessel or creature without having to make an attack throw. Doing so counts as the kraken’s attack with that tentacle.\n\nA restrained creature cannot move but can still attack, cast spells, take actions in lieu of attacking, or attempt to escape. A restrained vessel cannot move, ram, or steer, but any crew can continue to act normally. A creature can escape by breaking free, slipping free, or cutting off the tentacle, but a vessel can only escape from restraint if the tentacle(s) restraining it are cut off. The normal rules of the restrained condition (p. XX) otherwise apply.\n\nTo cut off a large tentacle, an attack must deal 50 or more slashing damage to it in one blow. To cut off a small tentacle, an attack must deal 30 or more slashing damage to it in one blow. Any damage dealt beyond the required amount is not dealt to the kraken (the tentacle was severed).\n\nIn addition to attacking with its tentacles, a kraken can also attack with its great beak for 3d20 {P!} damage. If it is restraining a vessel, it can attack the vessel. Otherwise, it can attack a creature that is within 5’ of its beak.\n\nIf a kraken succeeds on a bite attack against a creature of huge size or less with an unmodified throw of 18 - 20, it can **swallow** the creature. The swallowed creature suffers 3d20 {A!} damage at the start of its initiative each round and drowns after 10 rounds. If the swallowed creature has a tiny, small, or natural piercing or slashing weapon, it can attack the kraken from inside its belly with an attack penalty of -4.\n\nShould a swallowed creature die and remain in the kraken’s belly for 6 turns, it is irrecoverably digested. The kraken can cleave after swallowing a creature.\n\nOnce per day, a kraken can use its combat action to create a 180' radius **cloud of black ink** around itself. It typically uses this to obscure itself long enough to flee from a losing encounter. The ink has the effect of a *tenebrosity* spell but it disperses into the water after 1 turn.",
    "ecology": "Kraken roam the oceans in search of prey, for their great bulk demands they feed constantly. They make their lairs in the abyssal depths, often near coral reefs, shipwrecks, or other underwater structures where they can lurk unseen and, more importantly, deposit their eggs in hidden places.\n\nThey reproduce only once in their lifetime and intensively care for their offspring. The female deposits a gelatinous egg mass in a hidden place, and then stays with the mass until the eggs hatch. When a kraken is encountered in its lair, there is a 15% chance it will be guarding one egg mass. Giant kraken egg masses have 5 hp and weigh 25 st.",

They are keenly aware that if their headless and helpless body is slain or if they fail to re-join by daybreak, they will die.\n\nWhen a woman becomes a leyak, she loses the ability to birth children.

For instance, a craftpriest who becomes a living ancestor and advances to 11 HD would gain 6th level spells and access to ritual magic.\n\nLiving ancestors can attack with a stone fist or with any weapon with which they are proficient.

Every wereboar combines the ill-temper of a wild boar with the bloodthirsty savagery of a berserker, making for a most unpleasant and brutal creature.\n\nWereboars attempt to pass their infection to strong and powerful warriors.

While berserk, a wereboar gains a +2 bonus to attack throws and becomes immune to fear. However, the wereboar has a -2 penalty to AC and becomes limited in its tactics. It cannot conduct defensive movement to retreat or withdraw from an enemy within 5’ and cannot move in such a way that the range between itself and the nearest visible threat would increase. It must advance 5’ after cleaving if necessary to do so to engage an enemy and it has sufficient movement. Once it has begun, the berserker age cannot be ended until combat ends.
