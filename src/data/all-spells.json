Animated skeletons have Hit Dice equal to the Baseline Hit Dice such creatures have in life; for skeletons of humans or demi-humans, this means one Hit Die, regardless of the character level of the deceased. Zombies have one more Hit Die than the creatures’ Baseline HD. An animated skeleton can be created only from a mostly intact skeleton; a zombie can be created only from a mostly intact corpse.\n\nThe caster can give verbal orders to the animated undead when they rise and thereafter anytime they are in line of sight on his initiative. Complex or extensive orders require the caster to expend action in lieu of moving, but simple orders (“protect me!”) do not require an action. Orders can be given in any language the caster speaks. The animated undead will mindlessly obey whatever orders they are given to the best of their (limited) ability. They cannot accomplish tasks that require abstract thought or higher reasoning. If they complete all of their orders, or for whatever reason are physically unable to obey their orders, the undead will simply remain stationary until they receive new orders. The undead act on their own initiative each round.\n\nAnimate undeadnormally lasts for just one day, after which the creatures’ remains crumble to dust. However, the spellcaster can make the spell permanent by anointing each zombie or skeleton with 1 vial of unholy water per Hit Die. If this is done, the undead are permanently animated until they are destroyed. Animate undead is the reverse of smite undead.",

Anything worn or carried by the caster or target will be teleported as well, including one or more other creatures carried by or mounted on the teleported creature.\n\nA target that wishes to avoid being teleported can make a Spells saving throw. If the save succeeds, the target resists being teleported. If the save fails, the target is teleported.\n\nEXAMPLE: Elaria is charged by a war elephant carrying a rider and a howdah with four archers. When the war elephant gets to within 10’, Elaria casts arcane shift on it in an attempt to send it 360’ up in the air. The war elephant doesn’t want to beteleported, so it makes a Spells saving throw. Unfortunately, the save fails. Therefore the war elephant, its rider, and all the archers are all instantly teleported upward 360’.",

The sound can be centered anywhere within range, and within that range the sound can fluctuate and move, imitating approaching or receding footsteps, laughter, voices, and other possibilities. The caster can dynamically control the sound if he is within range of it. The sound produced can be as loud as the noise produced by thirty man-sized creatures. The auditory illusion does not have to be human-like; it can replicate animal cries, monstrous roars, trickling water, and other sounds. The Judge should determine how much sound and how many individuals it might represent. For instance, the sounds of thirty humans might be approximately that of sixty children, or eight ogres.\n\nA creature who has reason to be suspicious about the reality of the sound can make a Spells saving throw to disbelieve it at the start of its initiative. If the save succeeds, the creature learns the sound is an illusion and can hear any sound it might be concealing. If the save fails, the creature continues to believe it is real. The creature cannot attempt to disbelieve the auditory illusionagain until it has further evidence of its illusory nature (e.g. a friend tells him “it’s an illusion,” etc.)\n\nAt the caster’s discretion, the spell can be cast so that its duration does not begin until a particular trigger is met. The trigger can be as general or as detailed as desired, although only visual and audible triggers can be used. Triggers react to what appears to be the case. Disguises and illusions can fool them. Normal darkness does not defeat a visual trigger, but magical tenebrosity or invisibility does. Silent movement or magical silence defeats audible triggers. Audible triggers can be keyed to general types of noises or to a specific noise or spoken word. Actions can serve as triggers if they are visible or audible. The trigger cannot distinguish level, Hit Dice, or class except by external garb. The illusion can respond to triggers as far as 45’ away. Regardless of range, the illusion can respond only to visible or audible triggers and actions in line of sight or within hearing distance.\n\nWhen the spell is cast with a trigger, the caster must specify sound that it will make in advance, in case he is not there to dynamically control it. (If he is within range when it is triggered, he can dynamically control the sound.) The point at which the auditory illusion is centered will be noticeable with discern magic and the effect can be dispelled by targeting that point**.**",

Auguries are not always accurate, however. When the spell is cast, the Judge secretly makes a magic research throw on behalf of the caster. A natural roll of at least 7 always succeeds. If the throw succeeds, the augury is true and reliable. If the throw fails, the augury is false and misleading. In addition, the augury can see into the future only 3 turns, so anything that might happen after that does not affect the result. Thus, the result will not take into account the long-term consequences of a contemplated action.\n\nEXAMPLE: Zeodarë casts auguryto assess whether opening a treasure chest she’s discovered is likely to bring about a good or bad result. The Judge secretly makes a magic research throw on her behalf and rolls an 11, so her augury is true. The Judge knows that the chest is not locked or trapped, and contains 4,000gp. Therefore, he tells her that opening the chest will bring about a good result. The fact that the gold coins belong to a murderous assassin who will come hunting for her when he discovers they have been stolen is not reflected in the augury, because that event won’t happen in the next half hour.",

The avian messengercan understand any language(s) the caster speaks, and remember a message up to 1 minute (one round) long per level of the caster.\n\nOnce the caster has finished whispering his message, he must designate a recipient for the message.

Any creatures that start their initiative or move within 5’ of the barrier of blades are subject to attack as if from a readied 4 HD monster with one attack dealing 2d6 extraordinary slashing damage.

The vessel suffers 250 – 400 (1d4+4 x 50) bludgeoning structural damage and each crewmember or other creature on deck must make a Blast saving throw.

The wave vanishes back into the water as soon as its crest passes the target vessel.\n\nA vessel reduced to 0 shp may no longer move under its own power or attack with any vessel-mounted weaponry, and will sink in 1d10 rounds. Any crew remaining on board may still attack with personal weapons during this time. When the vessel sinks, or when knocked overboard, crew must begin making swimming throws each round.

When Raknar’s vessel gets to a range of 150’, Ra-Ramses smashes it with a capsizing wave. On Raknar’s initiative, he attempts to steer through the wave. Raknar’s longship is under sail with a sail speed of 720’. Therefore he must make a Seafaring proficiency throw with a target value of 17+. Fortunately, Raknar has three ranks of Seafaring proficiency, granting him a +5 bonus to the throw. Unfortunately, he rolls a 3, which still fails. The Red Viper is struck on its broadside and suffers 1d4+4 x 50 bludgeoning structural damage. Ra-Ramses rolls a 1, so the total is 250 shp. That reduces the longship to well below 0 shp, and it will sink in 1d10 rounds.\n\nMeanwhile, Raknar and his 75 crew must each make a Blast saving throw. Those that fail suffer 1d6 bludgeoning damage and are swept overboard. Raknar’s ill-luck continues as he fails his saving throw. The barbarian is carried into the murky waters...",

Creatures with less than 1 HD count as 1/2 HD each. Creatures with the fewest HD must be targeted first. The caster does not have to use the full HD available. Any excess HD of effectiveness are lost. When one or more creatures with the same number of HD are eligible to be targets, the caster can choose which are affected.\n\nEach target humanoid must make a Death saving throw. If the save fails, the target is instantly torn apart in a shower of blood and gore. If the save succeeds, the target suffers 2d4 extraordinary necrotic damage and must immediately roll on the Savage Mortal Woundstable and suffer the result listed under Permanent Wounds Suffered. (The target does not suffer from the results listed in the Condition & Recovery column.) When rolling on the Mortal Wound table due to carnage, the only modifiers that apply are those from CON and HD.\n\nNote that this spell indiscriminately slaughters its targets. It does not afford the caster any way to differentiate friend from foe except insofar as he chooses to use fewer than the full HD available or he has two creatures as eligible targets with the same HD and not enough excess HD to affect them both.\n\nEXAMPLE: Ra-Ramses is a 14th level mage, accompanied by his 0th level henchmen Thotep and his 1st level henchman Flavian. Ra-Ramses and his henchmen enter an open-air marketplace where 46 0th-level merchants are offering goods, supervised by one 1st level fighter. Ra-Ramses decides it would be easier to massacre them all than to barter for the goods he wants, so he casts carnage. After completing the spell, Ra-Ramses rolls 4d8, scoring an exceptional 5, 5, 7, and 8 on the dice. A total of 25 HD of creatures can be targeted. Ra-Ramses must target the creatures with fewest HD first, but can choose between eligible targets with the same HD. He first targets the 46 0th level merchants. That uses up 23 of his 25 HD of creatures. He’d like to target the 1st level fighter guarding the market place, but to do so he would first have to target 0th level Thotep. Ra-Ramses graciously accepts Thotep’s sacrifice for the cause and targets the hapless henchmen. Ra-Ramses has now used 23 1/2 of his 25 HD. He now targets the fighter, which uses up another 1/2 of his 25 HD. He has only 1/2 HD remaining, which is not enough to target anyone else. The excess 1/2 HD is wasted.",

Only one cacodemon spawn can be conjured by the caster in a given day. The cacodemon spawn will appear at the end of his initiative at a point chosen by the caster within his line of sight and spell range and can begin to act on the caster’s initiative on the following round.\n\nOnce the cacodemon appears, it serves the caster for up to one hour (6 turns), provided that the caster maintains concentration on controlling the creature. Spell casting, combat, or movement over half the normal rate results in loss of concentration. The caster, while in control of the cacodemon spawn, can dismiss it to its native sphere at will (doing so at the start of his initiative if in combat). The cacodemon cannot be controlled outside the range of the spell.\n\nIf the caster loses concentration, or the cacodemon is somehow forced out of range of the caster, control of the cacodemon is lost and cannot be regained. The creature then seeks to attack the caster and all others in its path. Only counterspell, dispel magic, or dispel evil can banish the cacodemon once control has been lost. An uncontrolled cacodemon might, of course, choose to return to its home sphere on its own; such creatures will never choose to remain away from their sphere of existence for long.\n\nCacodemons are highly variable in form and abilities. The first time this spell is cast, the caster should choose the form of the cacodemon spawn conjured, while the Judge should roll or choose its special abilities. The cacodemon spawn should then be assigned a name for later reference. Thereafter, the caster can choose to conjure any named spawn he has previously conjured and safely dispelled, or conjure a new spawn with a different form and special abilities.\n\nEXAMPLE: The first time Ra-Ramses conjures a cacodemon spawn, he selects the monadine form. The Judge determines it has the special abilities of swallow attack and grab and assigns it the name Ixubix the Enveloping Horror. Ra-Ramses uses Ixubix to envelop and dissolve a rival for power in the local temple, then dismisses it. Because he safely dismissed Ixubix, he can conjure it again in the future. The second time Ra-Ramses conjures a spawn, he can conjure either Ixubix or a new spawn. He chooses to conjure Ixubix. Unfortunately, on this casting Ixubix is destroyed in combat. Because Ixubix was destroyed rather than safely dispelled, Ra-Ramses cannot conjure it again.",

When the spell is cast, the caster chooses which sphere he wishes to contact. Each sphere has different types of entities of greater or less availability, reliability, and danger. The spheres are:\n\nCelestial: The caster contacts entities on other worlds within his own celestial sphere, separated from his world by vast gulfs of black void. Celestial entities are relatively safe to contact and are relatively responsive and truthful.\n\nElemental: The caster contacts one of the alien beings of raw elemental power that exist in the spheres of air, earth, fire, and water. Elemental beings are generally responsive and very truthful, but their alien thought patterns pose a risk to the caster’s soul.\n\nChthonic: The caster contacts one of the chaotic entities that dwells in the Chthonic Darkness. Chthonic beings are eager to entice the ambitious and powerful and are highly responsive, although not particularly truthful. Because of the long traditions of contact between humanity and these powers, they are relatively safe to contact.\n\nEmpyrean: The caster contacts one of the lawful entities that dwells in the Empyrean Heaven. Though benevolent, empyrean beings tend to concern themselves with the high patterns of providence and rarely respond to the individual petitions of mortals. Because of the long traditions of contact between humanity and these powers, they are relatively safe to contact.\n\nOuter Darkness: The caster contacts one of the eldritch horrors that dwells in the Outer Darkness between the spheres. The horrors of the Outer Darkness are always watching and waiting to speak with those who dare contact them, and when they speak they offer truth, no matter how terrible it might be. The spiritual risk of contacting the Outer Darkness is incredibly high and only the most foolish and desperate mages attempt it.\n\nWhile these spheres are based on the Auran Empire campaign setting, the Judge can assign these values to other planes of existence, alternative dimensions, and so on as appropriate to his campaign setting.\n\nThe caster may ask one question per two caster levels. He may ask questions at the rate of one per round; each question is answered by the contacted power during the same round. The powers reply in a language the caster understands. Each time a question is asked, the Judge rolls on the adjoining table to see if the power responds to the question and then rolls again to see if the power answers truthfully. The caster can ask the same question repeatedly if desired. The caster must concentrate on maintaining the spell while asking questions, but he does not have to continue asking questions if he has learned what he wishes. Some questions reduce his number of available questions by more than one.\n\nWhen contacting another sphere, the following types of questions can be asked:\n\nThe Judge can permit other types of questions at his discretion. Immediately after asking each question, the caster must make a Death saving throw, applying the modifier shown on the adjoining table, to see if he suffers spiritual harm from his contact with another sphere. If the save succeeds, the caster’s soul remains intact. If the save fails, the caster must roll on the Tampering with Mortality table for the alignment shown on the table above and suffer whatever side effect results. When rolling on the Tampering with Mortality table, the only modifier that applies is the caster’s WIL modifier. The caster can continue to ask questions even if he suffers a side effect, and can suffer multiple side effects during one series of questions.",

What makes this spell truly horrible is that its effects can only be undone by a creature of higher caster level than the caster who disfigured the body and soul. If this spell is cast by a 14th level mage with Black Lore of Zahar proficiency, it is virtually impossible to undo, even with wishor miracle.",

Alternatively, the caster can target a single creature or object weighing 2 stone (20 lbs) per caster level squared. Each targeted creature can make a Spells saving throw to resist the effect. If the save succeeds, the spell does not affect the creature. If the save fails, it is affected as above.\n\nThe affected creatures or objects can be flung in any direction the caster chooses. If the caster wishes to fling one or more of the affected creatures or objects into another creature, or onto a specific hard-to-reach location (such as a balcony or pit), he must make a successful attack throw. A throw of a single creature or object may be aimed without penalty, but each additional object or creature imposes a cumulative -1 penalty to the caster’s attack throws. If an aimed throw misses, it scatters like thrown oil.\n\nCreatures or objects flung into walls or other hard surfaces will suffer bludgeoning damage. Creatures or objects will also deal bludgeoning damage to whatever they strike. The amount of damage will be based on the flung creature or object’s weight, as shown on the adjoining table. Large flung objects will also deal damage to an area of effect around their point of impact. Creatures in this area of effect can avoid taking any damage with a successful Blast saving throw, but creatures actually struck by the flung object cannot avoid the damage. Damage from flung objects converts into shp at a rate of 1 shp per 5 points of damage.\n\nEXAMPLE: Quintus, a 9th level mage, is supporting a company of mercenaries during a siege. The mercenaries are suffering from the fire of a light catapult (120 st). Quintus casts force of impetus, enabling him to fling up to 9 objects of up to 18 stone each, or a single object of up to (9 x 9 x 2) 162 stone. He opts for the latter, and flings the light catapult onto its own four crew members. He makes a successful attack throw against one of the crew’s AC. That crew member takes 5d6 damage (and dies!). The other three crew members, all within 15’, must make Blast saves or suffer 5d6 damage each. The light catapult itself takes 5d6/5 shp, enough to destroy it.",

The ice**floe’s length, width, and thickness cannot exceed the length, width, and depth of the body of water from which it is created. It cannot be evoked so that it appears where objects or creatures already are. The water inside a living creature cannot be turned into an ice**floe, no matter how large the creature is.\n\nAs ice is less dense than water, the top of the ice floe will be about 10% higher than the surface of the water. A typical 1’ thick ice**floewill stick up about 1.25” above the water. The ice**floecan support up to 5 lbs of creatures or objects per cubic foot while remaining afloat, but any additional weight will cause the ice**floe to sink below the surface of the water. If the caster concentrates while touching the ice floe, he can magically move it across the water at a combat speed of 20’ per round.\n\nThe ice**floeis only as resilient as any other large block of frozen water. It counts as a structure with AC 2 and 5 shp. Man-sized creatures, large creatures, and light ballista cannot deal damage to the ice floe. Huge creatures, non-magical fire, and magic can deal 1/5th damage. Artillery, gigantic creatures, and magical fire can deal full damage.\n\nWhen an ice**floe is created in above-freezing temperatures, it will melt after 8 hours. Counterspell or dispel**magic will instantly melt an ice**floein above-freezing temperatures. Otherwise when the spell expires or dispelled, the caster loses the ability to magically move the ice**floe, but it does not melt until temperatures rise.

The ice sheetcreated by the spell can be either 1”, 4”, 1’, or 10’ thick.\n\nA 1” thick ice**sheetcan have a maximum surface area of 180,000 square feet (approximately 240’ radius), a 4” thick sheet can have a maximum surface area of 45,000 square feet (approximately 120’ radius), a 1’ thick sheet can have a maximum surface area of 15,000 square feet (approximately 70’ radius), and a 10’ thick sheet can have a maximum surface area of 1,500 square feet (approximately 20’ radius).\n\nThe ice**sheet’s surface area and thickness cannot exceed the surface area and depth of the body of water from which it is created. It cannot be evoked so that it appears where objects or creatures already are, but it can be evoked over creatures under the water. The water inside a living creature cannot be turned into an ice**sheet, no matter how large the creature is.\n\nAs ice is less dense than water, the top of the ice**sheet will be about 10% higher than the surface of the water. A 1” thick ice**sheetwill be about 1/8” above the water, a 4” thick sheet will be about 3/8” above the water, a 1’ thick onewill be about 1.25” above the water, and a 10’ thick one about 1’.\n\nCreatures can safely move across the ice**sheet at their encounter speed. Creatures moving across the sheet at their combat speed must make a proficiency throw of 2+ each round or fall prone. Creatures moving across the sheet at their running speed must make a proficiency throw each round with a target value equal to their encumbrance, or fall prone.\n\nThe ice**sheetcan support a maximum weight of 75,000 lbs across its entire surface. Any additional weight will cause the ice sheet to sink below the surface of the water. In addition, heavy creatures might break through the ice beneath their feet. A 1” thick sheet can only support small creatures (less than 35 lbs). A 4” thick sheet can support man-sized creatures (up to 400 lbs). A 1’ thick sheet can support large creatures (up to 2,000 lbs). A 10’ thick sheet can support gigantic creatures (up to 32,000 lbs). For each size category by which a creature exceeds the ice**sheet’s limit, the ice has a 1 in 6 chance each round of breaking beneath their feet. When this occurs, the creature falls into the water. Creatures in icy water also suffer 1 point of cold damage per round and must make a Swimming throw or begin drowning (see p. XX). If the creature passes the Swimming throw, it may pull itself back onto the safety of the ice on its initiative (although the ice may break again).\n\nEXAMPLE: Quintus is being pursued by an ogre. His escape is blocked by a 500’ wide river. He casts ice sheetand creates a 90’ wide, 500’ long, 4” bridge of ice across the river. As a man-sized creature, Quintus is able to safely cross the sheet. The ogre is a large-sized creature, however, and may break through the 4” thick ice. It is one size category larger than the 4” sheet’s limit, so it has a 1 in 6 chance each round of breaking through. Assuming the ogre crosses at its combat speed of 30’ per round, it will require 17 rounds to get across the ice....\n\nThe ice**sheetis only as resilient as any other large block of frozen water. It counts as a structure with AC 2 and 1 shp per 20 cubic foot area. Man-sized creatures, large creatures, and light ballista cannot deal damage to the ice floe. Huge creatures, non-magical fire, and magic can deal 1/5th damage. Artillery, gigantic creatures, and magical fire can deal full damage.\n\nOnce created an ice**sheetis perpetual until dispelled.

    "description": "Range: touchDuration: 1 day\n\nThe spell causes the recipient creature or object to become invisible to ordinary sight and even lightless vision. An invisible creature can still see itself. Otherwise, not even the caster can see the recipient without the aid of discern**invisible or true**seeing. The recipient can still be heard unless it is inaudible, noiseless, or moving silently. An invisible creature counts as hidden to all creatures unable to see until the spell ends.\n\nIf the recipient of the spell is a creature that is carrying and/or wearing items, the recipient’s carried and/or worn items vanish as well. However, any part of any item that the recipient carries that extends more than 10’ from it is visible. If the recipient drops or sets down invisible items it is carrying, the items immediately become visible. Conversely, if the recipient picks up a visible item and tucks into his clothing or containers, the item becomes invisible. Light never becomes invisible, although a source of light can become so, thus creating the effect of a visible light with no visible source. If the recipient of the spell is dusted with substances such as flour or powder, its dusted form remains visible until the end of its next initiative.\n\nIf the recipient casts a spell or attacks a creature, the spell expires at the end of the recipient’s initiative (i.e. after the attack is made or spell is cast). Attacking an unattended stationary object, or cleverly causing a creature harm indirectly, does not cause the spell to expire. The spell lasts at most 1 day.",

A levitating creature can carry its normal load (possibly including another creature), but the extra weight counts against the caster’s maximum weight. An object must be unattended or possessed by a willing creature.\n\nIn order to move the recipient, the caster must concentrate. The concentrating caster can move the recipient up to 20’ up or down each round on the caster’s initiative. The caster does not need to maintain concentration to sustain the spell. For instance, he can concentrate for one round to move the recipient 20’ up, take another action the following round, and then resume moving the recipient the subsequent round. The caster can change the target of levitation on each round that he concentrates, if desired.\n\nThe caster cannot move the recipient horizontally. However, if the recipient is a creature, it can still move by, e.g. clambering along the face of a cliff or pushing against a ceiling to move laterally, doing so at half its ordinary speed.\n\nA levitating creature that makes an attack throw is penalized due to its instability, and becomes increasingly unstable as it continues to attack. The first attack throw has a -1 attack penalty, the second a -2 penalty, and so on, to a maximum penalty of -5. If the caster spends a full round concentrating on stabilizing the creature, the penalty is reduced back to -1. (A concentrating caster can thus maintain a levitating archer at a -1 penalty from round to round.) A levitating creature can cast spells or use items or special abilities that do not require an attack throw without any penalty.\n\nIf the recipient is up in the air, and either the duration expires, the spell is dispelled, the affected creature or object is loaded beyond what the caster can telekinetically support, or the caster begins concentrating on a new target, the recipientwill immediately plummet from the air.",

The target object must be at least 4’ x 6’ in size, and can be up to 10’ x 15’.\n\nOnce enchanted, the magic carpetcan be steered through the air by the caster on his initiative. Steering the magic carpet is easier than riding a horse, and does not require Driving or Riding proficiency. If no passenger is carried, or only one man-sized passenger, the carpet can move with an encounter speed of 300’ per turn. If two or three man-sized passengers are carried, the carpet can move with an encounter speed of 240’ and 180’ per turn, respectively. No more than three man-sized creatures, or a total of 60 stone, can be carried on the magic carpet. The magic carpet can hover in place at any altitude.\n\nThe caster cannot cast spells while the magic carpet is moving, but can cast spells if the magic carpet is hovering. Passengers capable of casting spells can do so from the magic carpet provided they remain stationary on the carpet. The magic carpet is immune to area of effect attacks or spells but creatures on the carpet are affected by them normally. If a creature on the carpet takes bludgeoning or seismic damage, it must make a Paralysis saving throw. If the save fails, the creature falls off the carpet. If the save succeeds, the creature remains stationary on the carpet. If the magic carpet is itself the target of an attack, treat it as having an AC of 0 and a number of hit points equal to the caster’s. When the duration expires, or if the magic carpet is ever dispelled or destroyed, or starts carrying more than four man-sized creatures or 60 stone, the magic carpet will plummet from the air.",

In lieu of any Treatment or Timing modifiers, he adds a bonus equal to his caster level, or +11. His final d20 result is therefore (2-2+11) or 11. A result of 11, 2 on the Mortal Wounds table means that Ra-Ramses has had an eye damaged. However, he is not critically wounded nor does he need one week’s bed rest; instead he immediately is restored to 1 hp.

Actions can serve as triggers if they are visible or audible.

After hearing the quest, the target creature can, but does not have to, make a Spells saving throw to resist it. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect. If the save fails, or the target creature chooses not to make the save, the questis laid upon it. There are a number of reasons why a creature might waive its saving throw against quest. For instance, it may be willing to accept the questin exchange for some promised reward; it might be obliged to accept the quest to offer a sacred vow; it might be condemned due to crimes, with the questoffering its only chance of redemption; and so on.\n\nA creature cannot be given a quest to kill itself or to pursue a course of action that would result in certain (not just likely) death. Apart from those limits, the creature can be given a quest to pursue almost any other course of activity, including harming its allies, giving away cherished belongings, confessing its crimes, and so on.\n\nThe affected creature is not compelled to pursue the quest it has been given, but if it does not do so it will face terrible negative effects (decided by the Judge) for failing to do so. The negative effects will progress from minor penalties on rolls, to loss of class powers and spells, to reduction in attributes, to injury, sickness, and, ultimately, death. If the negative effects become too much to bear and the creature resumes its quest,all of the accrued negative effects are removed after one day. However, should the creature later shirk its questagain, all of the accrued negative effects will return instantly and progress from there.\n\nIf the quest was ambiguously worded or vague as to its meaning, the affected creature might be able to subvert the quest. For instance, if the creature has been sent on a quest to “find and bring to me a mighty magic sword,” it might be able to fulfill its quest by returning to the caster with a copy of the popular fantasy epic “A Mighty Magic Sword.”\n\nIf the quest requires the affected creature to complete a task that is logically or physically impossible for it to accomplish, the questends after one day per caster level. For instance, if the creature has been compelled to “find the nine-fingered kobold who slew Athelstan’s parents,” but Athelstan’s parents are alive and well, the questwill not last long. However, the creature might undergo significant torment in the interim as negative effects pile up for his failure to pursue the quest.\n\nA quest (and all effects thereof) can only be ended by a remove**curse spell from a caster of higher level than the caster of the quest or by a miracleor wish. Dispelling does not affect a questspell. A quest can be detected with discern bewitchment,but cannot be detected with discern magic.",

The caster must make an attack throw versus each curse. Each curse is considered to have an armor class equal to the difference in caster level between the creator of the curse and the caster of remove curse. If an attack throw succeeds, that particular curse is removed. If an attack throw fails, the spell or effect continues. In addition, if the creator of the curse has a higher caster level than the caster, the caster cannot try again to remove the curse until he has gained a level of experience.\n\nRemove**curse can be used to extinguish curses made permanent by ritual magic, but only if the caster is of higher level than whoever made the effect permanent. Certain other special curses cannot be countered by this spell at all, or may be countered only by a caster of a certain level or higher.\n\nA recipient who was cursed to retain and use a particular item (such as a sword -1) has one turn after this spell is cast to discard and/or destroy the item. If the recipient has not discarded the item by then, the curse returns. The curse on the object is not itself removed and can afflict future possessors.\n\nThe reverse of this spell, bestow**curse, allows the caster to place a curse on a target creature or unattended object. The target must make a Spells saving throw. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect. If the save fails, or the target was an unattended object, the curse takes effect. The caster can choose one of the following five effects, which will apply to the target creature or to the future possessor of the target object:\n\nThe caster may also invent his own curse, but it should be no more powerful than those described above. The curse thus bestowed cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed with dispel evil or remove**curse spell. If desired, the spellcaster can dictate a special condition under which the curse will automatically be lifted. Returning a stolen treasure to the tomb it was taken from is the most well-known condition; others are left to the caster’s imagination and the Judge’s discretion. The condition must be spoken aloud when the spell is cast, and must be something actually possible without resort to magic. A special condition is not required, but if one is offered it strengths the curse; a curse with a special condition can only be removed by a caster of greater caster level than the original spellcaster. A divination or fate spell cast upon the affected creature will reveal the specific condition to lift the curse (if any).\n\nThere is no limit to the number of different curses a character may suffer from. If not removed, the curse is perpetual, lasting until the caster dies or decides to stop sustaining it.

A runeofwarding can guard a bridge or passage, ward a portal, trap a chest or box, and so on. The maximum area of effect that can be protected by the ward is 25 square feet per caster level. The caster can ward up to 100 square feet each round. It can take multiple rounds for a caster to create a large rune, during which time the caster must maintain stationary concentration. The rune can conform to any shape up to the limitations of the total square footage.\n\nAfter creating the rune, the caster must choose to configure it as either a blast rune or spell rune. The caster must maintain stationary concentration for one additional round to configure the rune, and might have to cast a spell.\n\nBlast Rune: A blast rune can damage any creatures in the warded area or touching the warded object when it triggers. To create a blast rune, the caster simply specifies a damage type of his choice at the time of casting, choosing from extraordinary cold, extraordinary electric, extraordinary fire, or extraordinary seismic. When the rune is triggered, each creature must make a Blast saving throw. If the save fails, the creature takes 2 extraordinary cold, fire, electric, or seismic damage per caster level. If the save succeeds, the creature takes half that damage.\n\nSpell Rune: A spell rune can release a spell stored in the rune when it triggers. To create a spell rune, the caster must cast a blast, death, enchantment, reversed healing, or transmogrification spell of his choice into the rune. When the rune is triggered, the stored spell is cast at caster level. If the spell has an area of effect, the area of effect is centered on the center of the area or object warded. If the spell targets one or more creatures, it targets eligible creatures in order of proximity to the center of the area or object warded. The stored spells effects are resolved according to its description.\n\nAfter he configures the rune, the caster sets a password. The password must be short enough to say in a few seconds but can be in any language the caster speaks. Thereafter any creature entering or touching the warded area or opening the warded object without speaking the password within one round triggers the rune.\n\nIt is easy to accidentally trigger a rune of warding, because a completely configured rune is nearly invisible. It can be detected as a trap or with spells such as discern**magic or true**seeing. It can be dispelled normally. Alternatively, a character with Trapbreaking proficiency who also has a class power or proficiency enabling him to cast spells, read spell scrolls, or use arcane magic items can safely destroy a runeofwardingwith a successful proficiency throw.\n\nA runeofwardingvanishes when triggered. The spell is otherwise perpetual, lasting until dispelled or until the caster dies or decides to stop sustaining it.\n\nAshley J. Williams Second Memorial Rule (optional): If the creature entering or touching the warded area or opening the warded object knows and speaks the password, but cannot speak the language it’s in, he must make an Implements saving throw. If the save succeeds, he successfully speaks the password. If the save fails, he mangles the pronunciation so badly that the runeis triggered.",

The spellcaster must have access to a mirror, crystal, reflective pool, or other surface upon which the images can be displayed. The more familiar the caster is with the creature, object or place viewed, the clearer the images will be. The larger the area of the place viewed, the more clouded the images will be. If the target is inside an anti**-magicsphere or protected by indiscernibility, the images will be entirely opaque, revealing nothing.\n\nThe apparent point of view displayed depends on the size of the target: It will always be just far enough away from the target that its entire body (if a creature), surface area (if an object), or vicinity (if a place) is seen. The Judge chooses the exact angle and point. For instance, if the caster scries a castle, the Judge might decide he sees an image of the castle as if from a hill overlooking its entirety. If the caster scries a lord in that castle, the Judge might decide he sees an image of the lord as if from a courtier in the throne room.\n\nIf the caster chooses, he can cast eitherclairaudiencyor telepathyat the same time that he casts scryin order to use one of those spells while scrying. If so, the range of that spell is measured from the apparent point of view from which the caster is scrying. The spellcaster is otherwise unable to cast spells at or communicate with what he views.\n\nAnytime a creature capable of casting scry (due to its repertoire or a spell-like ability or current use of a magic item) is the target of scry, is in the target place, or is carrying or wearing the target object, the creature has a chance of learning he is being spied on. The Judge must make a secret Spells saving throw on behalf of the creature. If the save fails, the creature learns nothing. If the saving throw succeeds, the creature knows he is being scried upon and learns the spell signature of the caster doing so. If the scried creature itself casts scrywhile the original caster is still maintaining concentration, the scried creature can then scry on the caster with the same clarity that the caster is seeing with. (And yes, the original caster now gets a Spells saving throw to detect that he is now being scried on!) If the scried creature casts counterspellor dispel**magic, the scryspell is considered an eligible target to be dispelled.\n\nThe caster can scry on his target for up to 1 turn, but must maintain stationary concentration throughout.

The knowledge learned can be quite complex, equivalent to a single rank in a proficiency, a class power, a spell formula, or a language.\n\nThe temporary hit points will disappear at the expiration of the spell’s duration, while the knowledge will fade as if it was a barely-remembered dream. Nothing prevents a caster from writing down the knowledge gained from this spell before it fades, however.\n\nEXAMPLE: Ra-Ramses wishes to plumb the depths of the dungeon of his rival, Baldur the Black. Baldur’s dungeon is reputed to be a deadly maze filled with traps, secret doors, and foul guardians, so Ra-Ramses abducts Archimedian, the engineer who built the dungeon, and casts soul eating on him. Archimedian (a 5th level mage) fails his Death saving throw, so his soul is eaten by Ra-Ramses. Ra-Ramses gains 1d10+5 hp. The Judge decides that having complete knowledge of the layout and design of Baldur’s dungeon is equivalent to the Mapping proficiency, and thus within the purview of the spell. Ra-Ramses now has a day to exploit this knowledge, either by venturing into the dungeon immediately or by spending a day drafting maps.\n\nWhile soul**eatingis in effect, the spellcaster is treated as an inherently evil creature for purposes of discern**eviland holy circleeffects. A successful counterspell, dispel**evilor dispel**magicspell will strip the caster of his temporary proficiency and hit points.",

The phylactery can be an amulet, gem, jewelry box, locket, ring, or other item weighing 1/6 stone or less with no more than 1 shp. At the moment the spell is cast, the phylactery must be within spell range and the caster must know where it is, though he does not need to be able to see it. As soon as the caster transfers his soul into the phylactery, his physical body falls limp, seemingly lifeless. (A character who spends a round inspecting the body and makes a successful Healing proficiency throw to diagnose can ascertain that the body is alive in a state of suspended animation.)\n\nFrom the phylactery, the caster can use an action in lieu of attacking to return to his own body if it is within 120’ of the phylactery. Alternatively, he can use an action in lieu of attacking to attempt to possess the body of a nearby living creature within 120’ of the phylactery. The target creature is allowed a Death saving throw to resist. If the creature succeeds on its saving throw, the caster’s soul remains in the phylactery, and the target creature is immune to further attempts at possession for one turn (10 minutes). If the creature fails its saving throw, its body becomes possessed by the caster’s soul, while the creature’s soul becomes imprisoned in the phylactery. While possessing a creature’s body, the caster keeps his or her Intellect, Will, Charisma, level, class, attack bonus, saving throws, and mental abilities (including spellcasting ability), but gains the body’s Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, hit points, and natural abilities. The caster does not have access to any special abilities of the body, however.\n\nFrom a possessed body, the caster can take use an action in lieu of moving to abandon the body and return his soul to the phylactery, simultaneously releasing the trapped soul back to its own body. The spell ends when the caster’s soul returns to his own body, leaving the phylactery empty.\n\nIf the caster’s soul is in the phylactery, and the phylactery is destroyed or dispelled, then there are two possible outcomes. If the phylactery is within 120’ of the caster’s body, then the caster’s soul returns to its body. Otherwise, the caster’s soul departs and he dies. In either case, the spell ends.\n\nIf the caster’s soul is driven from a possessed body by dispel evil there are also two possibilities. If the phylactery is within 120’ of the possessed body, then the caster’s soul returns to the phylactery, and the possessed body’s soul returns to it. The caster cannot attempt to possess the same creature again for one full turn (10 minutes). If the phylactery is not in range of the possessed body, then the possessed creature’s spirit is freed from the phylactery, both the caster’s and the possessed body’s souls depart, and both the caster and the possessed creature die. In either case, the spell ends.\n\nIf a possessed creature’s soul is in thephylactery, and the phylactery is broken then one of the following may happen. If the phylactery is in range of the possessed creature’s body, then the caster’s spirit departs, the caster dies, the possessed creature’s soul returns to its body, and the spell ends. Otherwise, the possessed creature’s soul departs, and the caster’s soul is stranded in the possessed body. Note here that the spell has not ended. Dispel**evil can still be used to drive the caster’s spirit from the body, which departs as noted, ending the spell. In any case where the spell ends with the caster’s body unoccupied by a spirit, that body does truly die.",

The target corpse or skeleton must have come from a sapient living creature and must still have a largely-intact brain or skull with a mouth or jawbone. If both the brain and skull have rotted away or been destroyed, the target does not remember anything. If both the mouth or jawbone have rotted away or been destroyed, the target cannot answer any questions. When someone is slain to keep them quiet, the killer will often bash in the skull, cut away the brain, and remove the lips and jaw to avoid the remains being able to answer questions.\n\nThe caster may ask the target corpse or skeleton one question per two caster levels. He may ask questions at the rate of one per round; each question is answered by the corpse or skeleton during the same round. Unasked questions are wasted if the duration expires. The corpse’s knowledge is limited to what the creature knew during life, including the languages it spoke (if any). Answers are often brief, cryptic, or repetitive. Any given corpse or skeleton can only be targeted by this spell once per week.\n\nSpeak with dead does not actually contact the deceased creature’s soul. Instead, it draws on the remnants of spiritual residue that still linger in the corpse or skeleton. Thus, the remains possess only the knowledge that the creature had while alive, but not any information about events that transpired after its death or experiences in the afterlife. For instance, the corpse of a man who was slain by bugbears and then ritually impaled on a chthonic totem would remember everything up to the moment of its death, but would have no information about the ritual that caused its impalement or about what life is like in heaven or his current reincarnation.\n\nThis spell cannot target a corpse or skeleton that is or was ever animated as an undead creature.",

If a spell, elemental effect, or spell-like effect affects an area that is inclusive of the spellwarded**zone, but also affects areas outside the zone, the spellwardwill trigger, but its protection only extends to its own area of effect.\n\nEXAMPLE: Quintus, Marcus, Balbus, and Viktir are standing in a large amphitheater, 100’ in radius, the four of them strung out in a line 5’ apart. Quintus, now an 11th level caster, has cast spellwarded**zoneon a 20’ diameter sphere centered on himself. He, Marcus, and Balbus are all standing in the zonebut Viktir is 5’ outside its perimeter. Ramses-Ra calls down a 14th level fireballwith a 20’ diameter area of effect that strikes the area where Viktir, Balbus, and Marcus are standing.

It deals 50 fire damage! However, Balbus and Marcus are in a spellwarded**zone with 11 layers.The spellwardis triggered, and one of its layers is automatically expended to provides a +1d4 bonus to Balbus and Marcus’s saving throws. The die roll is a 3, so both Balbus and Marcus get a +3 bonus to their save. Balbus succeeds, but Marcus rolls badly and fails despite the bonus. Viktir, meanwhile, does not get the bonus, but he manages a lucky roll of 19 and succeeds anyway. The fireballwill deal 50 fire damage to Marcus and 25 fire damage to Balbus and Viktir.\n\nIf the triggering effect deals damage, one layer of the spellwardwill be automatically expended for every 5 points of damage the effect deals (ignore any reduction from saving throws), up to the maximum number of layers. Each layer expended reduces the damage by 1d4 points. If the damage is reduced to 0 or less by the spellward, then any creature(s) in the area are entirely unharmed, and do not suffer an interruption of concentration or other effects that may accrue upon being hit.\n\nEXAMPLE: Ramses-Ra’s fireballis dealing 50 fire damage. Therefore (50/5) 10 layers of the spellwardare automatically expended in order to reduce the damage by 10d4 points. The dice roll results in 30 points of damage reduction. Balbus, whose save succeeded, therefore takes no damage. Marcus, whose save failed, takes (50-30) 20 fire damage. Viktir, whose save succeeded, takes 25 fire damage because he is outside the spellwarded**zone.\n\nIf the spellwarded zone is subjected to counterspell or dispel magic spell, it will expend one layer of the ward per two caster levels of the dispel in order to increase its effective caster level by 1d4 per layer, making it harder to dispel the zone. Spellward**zone expires when all of the layers are expended, or after 6 turns, whichever comes first.

The caster’s spirit has the same number of hit points as the caster’s body at the time of casting, but thereafter body and spirit are damaged separately. If the caster’s spirit is reduced to 0 hp, the spirit is destroyed. Fortunately, because it is incorporeal, the caster’s spirit can only be damaged by magic weapons or by spells or effects dealing extraordinary damage. If the caster himself has natural weapons in his physical form, the caster’s spirit possesses those natural weapons as well; they deal extraordinary damage to incorporeal targets but cannot harm corporeal targets.\n\nOnce a spiritwalk begins, it continues until the caster’s spirit returns to his body, the caster’s spirit is destroyed, the caster’s body is slain, or the spell is dispelled. The caster can voluntarily return his spirit to his body at the start of his initiative. When the spirit and body reunite, any damage the spirit has suffered is dealt to the body as well. If the spiritwalking character’s spirit is destroyed, or if the spell expires before the caster’s soul has returned, his body falls into a catatonic slumber that can only be lifted with restorelifeand**limb,resurrection, miracle, or wish. If the spiritwalking character’s body is destroyed, the character dies at the end of the spiritwalk.",

Natural disasters (such as blizzards, hurricanes, typhoons, or tornados) can be summoned but only in locations and at times where they occur regularly and the caster has no control over the exact manifestation of the disaster. For instance, a caster in “tornado country” could summon a tornado, but he could not control exactly where it appeared and what path it took.

The caster can telekinetically move up to 6 stone per caster level.\n\nIf the caster targets a willing recipient, an unattended object, or an object possessed by a willing creature, the spell automatically moves the target. If the caster targets an unwilling creature, or an object possessed by an unwilling creature, the creature must make a Spells saving throw. If the save fails, the target can be moved. If the save succeeds, the target cannot be moved this round, but the caster can try again on the same or another target on his next initiative.\n\nTo move the affected creature or object, the caster must concentrate. The concentrating caster can move the affected creature up to 20’ in any direction each round on the caster’s initiative, including on the round he cast the spell. The caster does not need to maintain concentration to sustain the spell. For instance, he can concentrate for one round to move the recipient 20’ up, take another action the following round, and then resume moving the recipient the subsequent round. The caster can change the target of telekinesis on each round that he concentrates, if desired. However, if he stops moving an unwilling creature, then wants to move the creature again later, the creature receives a new saving throw to resist being moved.\n\nIf the affected creature or object is up in the air, and either the duration expires, the spell is dispelled, the affected creature or object is loaded beyond what the caster can telekinetically support, or the caster begins concentrating on a new target, the affected creature or objectwill immediately plummet from the air.",

When the spell is cast, the caster can request a telepathic link with a target sapient creature. The target “feels” its mind being “touched.” The target can either accept the telepathic link or attempt to refuse it. If the target accepts the link, it is automatically established. If the target attempts to refuse the link, it must make a Spells saving throw. If the save fails, the link is established despite its refusal. If the save succeeds, the link is not established.\n\nOnce the link is established, the caster can read all of the target’s surface thoughts and can send thoughts of his own to the target. Note that this is asymmetrical: the caster can read what target is thinking, even if the target doesn’t want him to, while target can only read what the caster chooses to send.\n\nSince telepathy only allows the caster to read the target’s surface thoughts, the target’s deeply held secrets, private concerns, or suppressed memories cannot usually be accessed with telepathy unless they are somehow brought to the surface of the target’s mind. A clever caster might transmit cues, reminders, or triggers to try to bring certain thoughts to the surface, or might even have a nearby accomplice provoke the target to expose what it thinks. Such shenanigans are left to the Judge’s discretion to decide.\n\nThe caster must maintain stationary concentration to keep a telepathic link active. The caster does not need to maintain concentration to sustain the spell. For instance, he can concentrate for one round to communicate with a target, take another action the following round, and then establish a new link with that or another target on the subsequent round. The caster can change the creature with which he is linked each round that he concentrates, if desired. However, if the caster breaks his telepathic link with an unwilling creature, then wants to link with that creature again later, the creature receives a new saving throw to resist the link.",

If the save succeeds, the target resists being teleported.\n\nTeleportation is notoriously inaccurate and dangerous, and only the desperate or reckless use it often. The chance of the spell working correctly depends on how familiar the caster is with the intended destination. The more familiar the caster, the better the chance of the spell working correctly. For purposes of the spell, there are four degrees of familiarity. The caster is considered intimately familiar with places he has regularly inhabited for many years, such as his own residence or his childhood home. The caster is considered familiar with places he can currently see or places he has visited repeatedly in recent memory, such as a favorite tavern or place of worship. The caster is considered somewhat familiar with places he has personally visited at least twice or scried on for at least an hour. The caster is considered vaguely familiar with places he has personally visited just once, has briefly scried, or has only seen rendered in art or by illusion.\n\nTo determine how well the teleportation works, roll d% and consult the table below.\n\nCaster Familiarity On Target Off Target Lost\n\nIntimately Familiar 01 – 95 96 – 99 00\n\nFamiliar 01 – 80 81 – 90 91 – 00\n\nSomewhat Familiar 01 – 50 51 – 75 76 – 00\n\nVaguely Familiar 01 – 30 31 – 65 66 – 00\n\nIf the result is On Target, the teleported creature arrives at the intended destination at ground level in a suitable and open point. If the result is Off Target, the teleported creature arrives 1d10 x 10 feet away from the intended destination in a random direction. If this location already be occupied by solid matter, the creature is instantly killed; if this location is above the ground, the creature immediately plummets to earth. If the result is Lost, the teleported creature does not arrive at all. Whether such hapless creatures are disintegrated, trapped forever in some other sphere of existence, or transported to some distant time and place is a matter of debate among the wise. Under no circumstances can a caster intentionally teleport himself or another creature off target, into thin air, or into solid matter.",

The wallofcorpsescannot be evoked so that it appears where objects or creatures already are.\n\nUpon beholdinga wallofcorpses, creatures must make a Paralysis saving throw. If the saving throw succeeds, the creature is immune to the effects of beholding the wall.  If the saving throw fails, the creature begins faltering. The condition lasts until the wall is dispelled or until the creature no longer beholds the wall. If the creature beholds the wall again, it must save again if not already immune. Any creatures starting their initiative or moving to within 5’ of the wall are attacked as if from a readied attack by a zombie (see the ACKS II Monstrous Manual).\n\nA counterspell, *dispel magic,*or a disintegrationspell can destroy a wallofcorpsesimmediately. A wallofcorpses can also be damaged by normal or magical attacks dealing damage of any type except necrotic. The wall has AC 4 and 10 hp per caster level, and saves as a fighter of caster level. A crusader or other character capable of turning undead can attempt to turn the wall as if it were an Infernal creature. If the turning throw succeeds, the corpses within lose their animating force, rendering the wall merely an inert, fleshy barrier for the duration of the turning. If the turning throw succeeds with a D (destroyed) result, the wall is instantly destroyed. If not otherwise destroyed or dispelled, the wall vanishes in 2 turns.",
