  "markdown": "### Boar, Giant\n\nThese giant cousins of ordinary boars are 7’ to 10’ long and weigh about 930 lbs. They are much more aggressive, cunning, and predatory than the ordinary breeds. Orcs (which were bred from boars) have a special affinity for them, and often use giant boards as mounts in battle.\n\nGiant boars are much smarter than ordinary boars. However, they are much slower to grow and eat much more food than ordinary boars, so giant piglets are actually worth less than common as piglets.\n\nWhether in the wild or with orcs, giant boars crave the meat of humanoids, and will attack them with little to no provocation. Humanoids other than orcs that encounter giant boars suffer a -2 penalty to their reaction rolls.\n\n###### Combat\n\nLike ordinary boars, giant boars have **acute hearing** and **acute olfaction.** They gain a +2 bonus to avoid surprise in their natural habitat. They can track the scent of creatures for up to 4 miles with the equivalent of two ranks of Tracking proficiency.\n\nIn combat, giant boars gore their targets with their mighty tusks for 3d4 {P} damage.\n\n###### Ecology\n\nWhen giant boars are encountered in their den, the giant boars will be rearing 2d4 juvenile boars and 1d4 baby boars. Juvenile giant boars have AC 1, Spd 90’, HD 2+2, and attack with stubby tusks (1d6 {P}). Baby giant boars have AC 0, Spd 90’, HD 1+1, and attack with head butts (1d2 {B}).\n\n###### Spoils\n\nA slain giant boar can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following component:\n\n* tusks (3 2/6 st, 200gp, *curse of swine, righteous wrath,* armor +1)\n\nIf not used for magic research, a giant boar’s two tusks fetch 2gp and weigh 1/6 st each. Its pelt fetches 80gp and weighs 2 3/6 st.\n\n###### Encounter\n\nA shrub thicket has become the shelter of a family of **two giant boar**, **four juvenile boars**, and **two baby boars**. The boars have dragged broken branches and grasses to form a ground cover, and dug down to cover themselves with soil and pine needles. The tough old boar who leads the family has a leather collar around his neck, moldy and rotten. The boar and the oldest sow have both been branded with an orcish sigil, “Urtyarg.”\n\n**Giant boar (2):** Spd 120’, AC 3, HD 5, hp 30, 21, #AT 1 (tusk 6+), Dmg 3d4 {P}, Save F5, ML +2, AL N, XP 200\n\n**Juvenile boars (4):** Speed 90’, AC 1, HD 2+2, hp 11 each, #AT 1 (stubby tusk 8+), Dmg 1d6 {P}, Save F2, ML +2, AL N, XP 35\n\n**Baby boars (2):** Speed 90’, AC 0, HD 1+1, hp 6 each, #AT 1 (head butt 9+), Dmg 1d2 {B}, Save F1, ML +2, AL N, XP 15\n\n![](data:image/png;base64...)\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Giant Boar Primary Characteristics** | |\n| **Type:** | Animal (giant) |\n| **Size:** | Large (93 st.) |\n| **Speed (land):** | 40’ / 120’ |\n| **Armor Class:** | 3 |\n| **Hit Dice:** | 5 |\n| **Attacks:** | 1 (tusk 6+) |\n| **Damage:** | 3d4 {P} |\n| **Save:** | F5 |\n| **Morale:** | +2 |\n| **Vision:** | Night Vision |\n| **Other Senses:** | Acute Hearing, Acute Olfaction |\n| **Proficiencies:** | Listening 8+, Tracking 7+ |\n| **Normal Load:** | 30 st. |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Giant Boar Secondary Characteristics** | |\n| **Expedition Speed:** | 24 miles |\n| **Supply Cost:** | 16gp (carnivorous) |\n| **Training Period:** | 2 months |\n| **Training Modifier:** | +2 |\n| **Battle Rating:** | 0.070 (individual), 4 (unit) |\n| **Lifespan:** | 0/1/5/9/15/22/30/37 |\n| **Reproduction:** | 2d4 piglets every 16 months |\n| **Untrained Value:** | 200gp (A) / 3gp (J) / 2gp (B) |\n| **Trained Value:** | 850gp (hunter)  1,675gp (war mount) |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Giant Boar Encounter Set-Up** | |\n| Lair: | 25% |\n| **Dungeon Enc:** | Sounder (1d4) / Den (1d4+1) |\n| **Wilderness Enc:** | Sounder (1d4) / Den (1d4+1) |\n| **Alignment:** | Neutral |\n| **Treasure Type:** | None |\n| **XP:** | 200 |\n\n",
