  "markdown": "### Fungus, Violet\n\nViolet fungi are large animate mushrooms that can vary in color from an overall purple hue to a dull gray or violet covered with purple spots. They closely resemble shriekers, with which they often grow in symbiotic patches: When the shriekers’ hellish racket attracts a curious creature, the violet fungus tries to kill it. Both fungi enjoy the fruits of a successful hunt, as the decomposing matter of the slain creature feed growth.\n\nUnlike the sessile shriekers, however, violet fungi are mobile. A violet fungus can slowly move across the ground by expanding and contracting its stipe, undulating somewhat like an upright caterpillar. Violet fungi are found in dank caves, damp dungeons, and other dark, wet locations underground. They are virtually never seen on the surface.\n\n###### Combat\n\nViolet fungi “see” by means of **terrestrial mechanoreception**,enabling the fungus to sense vibration in the ground over long distances equivalent to line of sight in full daylight. Spells or effects that would ordinarily cause blindness do not affect the fungus. However, creatures that are flying, levitating, or otherwise not touching the ground are invisible to it. Terrestrial mechanoreception can penetrate structures and terrain features.\n\nA violet fungus has four tentacles that secrete a lethal toxin carried in black oily spores. Any creature damaged by a tentacle must make a Death saving throw. If the save succeeds, there is no effect. If the save fails, the creature becomes **queasy** immediately and will die in 2d6 turns.\n\nViolet fungi are **immune** to enchantment effects and to poisonous damage (except from poisons specifically designed to work on fungi).\n\n###### Ecology\n\nViolent fungi reproduce biannually by dispersing tiny spores that are invisible to the naked eye. These spores are then carried by underground air currents throughout the subterranean environment.\n\nThe fungi themselves also tend to meander through the underdark, at least until they find a patch of shrieking fungi to nestle within.
