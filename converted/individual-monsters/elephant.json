They are native to Celdorea, Somirea, and the Ivory Kingdoms, where they are frequently used as work beasts and war mounts. The Somirean army is famous for fielding hundreds of armored war-elephants, each carrying a howdah filled with as many as a dozen troops.\n\nThey are among the most intelligent of all animals. They are capable of using tools to solve simple problems, can make complex vocalizations to coordinate activity within their herds, and have been known to bury and mourn their dead.\n\n###### Combat\n\nElephants have **acute hearing** and **acute olfaction.** They gain a +2 bonus to avoid surprise in their natural habitat. Despite their size, they are gentle creatures and will usually only attack if provoked (+2 reaction rolls). If provoked, elephants prefer to start combat by **charging** with their tusks. Elephant tusks deal double damage dice (4d4 {B!}each) when used in a charge.\n\nIf closely pressed, elephants will attempt to **trample** their opponents. An elephant gains a +4 bonus to attack throws when attempting to trample a creature of large size or smaller. If a trample attack succeeds against such a creature, the creature must make a Paralysis saving throw. A small creature saves at -8, a man-sized creature at -6, and a large creature at -4. If the save fails, the creature takes damage, then is forced aside 10’ (to a point left or right of the elephant), landing **prone**. If the saving throw succeeds, the creature takes damage but is not forced aside. An elephant can cleave after a successful trample attack that forces aside a creature.\n\n###### Ecology\n\nWhen elephants are encountered, there is a 50% chance they will be a matriarchal herd. (Otherwise, it’s a bachelor herd.) In a matriarchal herd, the adults will be accompanied by 1d6-1 juvenile elephants and 1d4 baby elephants. Juvenile elephants are huge size, have AC 2, Spd 90’, HD 4+2, and attack by trampling (4d4 {B!}). Juvenile elephants can only take a +4 bonus versus and force aside small and man-sized creatures, which save at -6 and -4 respectively. Baby elephants are large size, have AC 1, Spd 90’, HD 3, and attack by stomping (1d8 {B}).\n\n###### Spoils\n\nA slain elephant with exceptional attributes can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following component:\n\n* tusks (11 4/6 st, 700gp, *call of the ancient tusk, force of impetus, striking,* armor +1, weapon +3)\n\nIf not used for magic research, an elephant’s two tusks each fetch 1d6x100gp and weigh 1 st per 100gp value. An elephant’s hide fetches 165gp and weighs 24 st.\n\nElephants are easy to tame and train and every realm that has access to a population of the great beasts has found use for them.\n\n![](data:image/png;base64...)\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Elephant Primary Characteristics** | |\n| **Type:** | Animal (giant) |\n| **Size:** | Gigantic (900 st.) |\n| **Speed (land):** | 40’ / 120’ |\n| **Armor Class:** | 4 |\n| **Hit Dice:** | 9 |\n| **Attacks:** | 2 or 1 (2 tusks or trample 2+) |\n| **Damage:** | 2d4 {P!} /2d4 {P!} or 4d8 {B!} |\n| **Save:** | F5 |\n| **Morale:** | 0 |\n| **Vision:** | Night Vision |\n| **Other Senses:** | Acute Hearing, Acute Olfaction |\n| **Proficiencies:** | Listening 4+, Swimming |\n| **Normal Load:** | 180 st. |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Elephant Secondary Characteristics** | |\n| **Expedition Speed:** | 24 miles |\n| **Supply Cost:** | 48gp |\n| **Training Period:** | 1 month |\n| **Training Modifier:** | +3 (semi-sapient) |\n| **Battle Rating:** | 0.229 – 1.374 (ind.), 1 – 7 (unit) |\n| **Lifespan:** | 0/5/12/18/34/51/68/85 |\n| **Reproduction:** | 1 calf per 5 years |\n| **Untrained Value:** | 1,150gp (A) / 630gp (J) / 315gp (B) |\n| **Trained Value:** | 2,000gp (war mount)  1,150gp (work beast) |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Elephant Encounter Set-Up** | |\n| **Lair:** | None |\n| **Dungeon Enc:** | None |\n| **Wilderness Enc:** | Herd (5d4) |\n| **Alignment:** | Neutral |\n| **Treasure Type:** | Spoils Only |\n| **XP:** | 700 |\n\n",
