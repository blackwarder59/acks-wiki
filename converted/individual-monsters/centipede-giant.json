  "markdown": "### Centipede, Giant\n\nAura’s natural historians disagree as to whether giant centipedes are magical crossbreeds or atavistic throwbacks to an era when arthropods ruled the world. Whatever their origin that these foot-long quarter-pound poisonous centipedes prefer dark, wet locations.\n\n###### Combat\n\nGiant centipedes have **terrestrial mechanoreception** enabling them to sense vibration in the ground over long distances equivalent to line of sight in full daylight. Spells or effects that would ordinarily cause blindness do not affect the beetle when it is using terrestrial mechanoreception. However, creatures that are flying, levitating, or otherwise not touching the ground are invisible to the sense. Terrestrial mechanoreception can penetrate structures and terrain features.\n\nWhen they detect prey, giant centipedes attack with a poisonous bite that deals 1 {P} damage. Any creature damaged by the bite must make a Poison saving throw. If the save succeeds, there is no effect. If the save fails, the creature becomes **incapacitated** at the end of the centipede’s initiative. The conditions lasts for 10 days or until the poison is neutralized.\n\n###### Ecology\n\nWhen a nest of giant centipedes is encountered, there is a 12% chance per centipede that it will be incubating a clutch of 1d6 eggs. The eggs have 1 hp and weigh 1/1000 st (e.g. 1 coin). Centipede hatchlings are rarely found in nests, because the larvae immediately disperse into the wild after they emerge from their eggs.\n\n###### Spoils\n\nA slain giant centipede can be harvested with Animal Husbandry 2 for the following components useful in magic research:\n\n* bundle of legs (1/6 st., 3gp, *bloody flux*)\n* mandibles (1/6 st., 3gp, *slumber*)\n\nIf not used for magic research, a giant centipede’s mandibles fetch 1gp and weigh 1/6 st. Its venom (onset time of 1 turn, +2 saving modifier, target incapacitated for 1d10 turns) fetches 50gp and weighs 1/6 st.\n\n###### Encounter\n\nA centuries-old building, some 75’ square, perhaps the villa of some lord from antiquity, has fallen into rubble. The collapse of the walls and ceiling has shattered the flagstones in the floor, creating large pockets of debris encircled by foundation stones. Between the debris piles are pools of murky, polluted water. **15 giant centipedes** have formed a nest here. One of the centipedes is incubating **6 centipede eggs**.\n\nGiant centipedes (15): Spd 60', AC 0, HD 1/2\\*, hp 2 each, #AT 1 (bite 10+), Dmg 1 {P} + poison, Save NM, ML -1, AL N, XP 6; Special: poison bite (save v.
