  "markdown": "### Herald Angel\n\nHerald angels are powerful extraplanar entities that serve as emissaries and enforces of the Empyrean gods. Appearing as winged humans of great beauty and majesty dressed in shining armor, herald angels are fiery, forceful, and fearsome, but always just in their dealings with all beings.\n\nHerald Angels natively speak the Empyrean tongue of the high gods. Those sent to Aurëpos as heralds will also speak the languages of the region to which they are assigned.\n\n###### Combat\n\nIn melee, herald angels fight with **blazing two-handed swords** that deal 5d10 {L!} {S!} damage. Once per turn, the herald angel can use its sword to discharge a **blast of luminous fire** in a 60’ long and 30’ wide cone. Each creature within the area of effect must make a Blast saving throw. If the save fails, the creature suffers 13d6 {L!} damage and is **blinded** for 3d6 rounds. If the save succeeds, the creature takes half that damage and is not blinded. A herald angel’s sword melts into slag if the herald angel is dispelled or slain.\n\nHerald angels are **potent spellcasters**, able to cast spells as 13th-level crusaders. In addition, they possess the following spell-like abilities: *cure disease*, *discern evil*, *dispel magic*, *invisibility*, *perpetual illumination*, *remove curse*, and *remove fear* (all at will); *cure serious injuries* and *fiery pillar* (thrice per day); and *restore life and limb* (once per day).\n\nAt all times, a herald angel radiates an **aura of glory** in a 30’ radius around itself. Any Lawful creature that begins its initiative in, or moves into, the aura becomes **inspired** until they start their initiative outside the aura.\n\nAny Neutral or Chaotic creature that begins its initiative in or moves into the aura must make a Spells saving throw. If the save succeeds, the creature is immune to the aura for one day. If the save fails, the effects depend on the creature’s alignment.\n\n* Neutral creatures become **mesmerized** by the angel until the angel attacks them or they start their initiative outside the aura.\n* Chaotic creatures become **cowed** by the angel until they start their initiative outside the aura or until the angel attacks them. When the angel attacks them, they become **frightened** until they start their initiative outside the aura.\n\nHerald angels are **immune** to luminous damage, poisonous damage, and all mundane damage. As holy beings, they can be detected with *discern good*, held at bay by *unholy circle* and destroyed with *dispel good.* If summoned, they can be dispelled by *counterspell* or *dispel magic*.\n\n###### Ecology\n\nHerald angels rarely appear on Aurëpos except when called forth by a spell or pinnacle of good. Sometimes, however, they are found guarding holy shrines or relics of Law.\n\n![](data:image/png;base64...)\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Herald Angel Primary Characteristics** | |\n| **Type:** | Incarnation (angel) |\n| **Size:** | Large (65 st.) |\n| **Speed (land):** | 30’ / 90' |\n| **Speed (fly):** | 90’ / 270’ |\n| **Armor Class:** | 13 |\n| **Hit Dice:** | 13\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* |\n| **Attacks:** | 1 (sword -2) or radiant blast |\n| **Damage:** | 5d10 {L!} {S!} or 13d6 {L!} |\n| **Save:** | F13 |\n| **Morale:** | +3 |\n| **Vision:** | Lightless Vision (60’) |\n| **Other Senses:** | Standard |\n| **Proficiencies:** | Theology 3+ |\n| **Normal Load:** | 21 st. |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Herald Angel Secondary Characteristics** | |\n| **Expedition Speed:** | 108 miles (air) or 18 miles (land) |\n| **Supply Cost:** | None |\n| **Training Period:** | 1 month (sapient) |\n| **Training Modifier:** | None (sapient) |\n| **Battle Rating:** | 56.231 (individual) |\n| **Lifespan:** | Indefinite |\n| **Reproduction:** | None |\n| **Untrained Value:** | 64,000gp (A) / - / - |\n| **Trained Value:** | 1,333,000gp (controlled) |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Herald Angel Encounter Set-Up** | |\n| **Lair:** | 10% |\n| **Dungeon Enc:** | Solitary (1) / Solitary (1) |\n| **Wilderness Enc:** | Solitary (1) / Solitary (1) |\n| **Alignment:** | Lawful |\n| **Treasure Type:** | None |\n| **XP:** | 6,400 |\n\n###### Spoils\n\nA destroyed herald angel can be harvested with Alchemy 2 for the following components useful in magic research:\n\n* Golden ichor (1067 st, 64,000gp, *angelic aura, angelic choir, avian messenger, , cure disease, cure injuries, deflect ordinary weapons, discern evil, dispel magic, energy invulnerability (luminous, poisonous), fiery pillar, invisibility, perpetual illumination, remove curse, remove fear, spiritual weapon, striking, sword of fire, winged flight*)\n\n",
