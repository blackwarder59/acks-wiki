Always depicted as a dark-skinned human with a scarab beetle as a head, the Khepri is believed to have been a god, an avatar of one of the Chthonic deities. The truth is more terrifying: The khepri was not a god; *they* were a race, the dominant race in Aurëpos in the era before man, their dark rule contested only by their eternal foes, the faravahar (see p. XX). Few khepri survived the devastation of the Day Without Night. Most of the survivors slumber in hidden vaults in remote places. The few khepri that have been roused to action have been great and malevolent actors in Aurëposean history, often serving as prophets and teachers of Chthonic beliefs in order to lay the groundwork for the Awakening.\n\nThe legend of the beetle-headed god arises from the alien appearance of the creatures. A khepri’s torso and limbs resemble those of a tall and muscular jet-black humanoid, but its head is protected by a smooth, shiny black carapace. A crown of chitin extends from the brow of this carapace, while three long mandibular appendages extend like legs from either side of it, the whole resembling a beetle’s body. But it is not. The front portion of the khepri’s carapace consists of segmented plates that can be opened to reveal an utterly inhuman face within, upon which countless khepri larvae squirm and writhe.\n\nKhepri speak their own language, an ancient tongue related to Ancient Zaharan. They typically also speak several other languages. Because of their superhuman intellect, khepri tend to quickly learn the local dialects and languages of their area.\n\n###### Combat\n\nKhepri hegemony was founded on the race’s mental powers. All khepri have the ability to use each of the following spell-like abilities at will: *body equilibrium* (like *water walking*, but extending to all loose or unstable surfaces, such as sand), *clairaudience*, *clairvoyance*, *choking grip*, *discern invisible*, *levitation*, and *telepathy***.** Khepri can also *bewitch monster*once per day.\n\nA khepri can open and close its head carapace as a movement action. A khepri’s true face is a **horrifying visage**. Immediately after the carapace is opened, and at the start of each round thereafter until the carapace is closed, each creature beholding the khepri’s true face must make a Paralysis saving throw. The save suffers a -1 penalty per additional khepri after the first. If the save fails, the creature is **cowering** until the start of the next round. If the save succeeds, the creature gains immunity to the effects of every khepri’s horrific visage for 1 turn.\n\nAs a combat action, a khepri can **kiss** an adjacent cowering, helpless, or vulnerable humanoid creature. If the kiss hits, the khepri’s larvae leap onto the unfortunate victim’s face, burrow into his skull via his mouth, nose, and ears, and make their way to his brain. At the end of its next initiative, the victim must make a Death saving throw. If the saving throw fails, the victim dies from shock. If the saving throw succeeds, the victim survives but is **enslaved** to the khepri.\n\nThe larvae can be destroyed (before or after the saving throw) by casting a *cure disease*spell on the victim. Destroying the larvae frees an enslaved victim, but does not revive a slain one. An enslaved victim is also freed if the khepri who kissed him is slain. If the larvae are not destroyed, they will grow inside the victim, feeding on his essence. After 2d4 weeks, the victim will slip into a state of unconsciousness, during which the engorged larvae will weave a cocoon around its head. 72 hours later, the victim must make another Death saving throw. If the save fails, the victim dies. If the save succeeds, the victim will awaken to his new life... as one of the khepri. Once the victim has fallen unconscious, no magic can save him except a *wish*or *miracle*. Death is usually the kinder alternative.\n\n###### Ecology\n\nKhepri are usually solitary creatures, but from time to time hapless adventurers will stumble upon one of the ancient vaults the khepri built to survive the Day Without Night.\n\nA khepri vault will be led by a hierarch with 11 (or more) Hit Dice. Khepri hierarchs can use the following additional abilities: *phantasmal horror*, *scry*with *clairaudience*, *strength of mind*, and *weakness of mind*once per day; *adjust self*and *arcane shift*thrice per day; and *telekinesis* at will. They are also capable of brewing potions, creating constructs, creating crossbreeds, and performing necromancy as mages of their HD, and can collect divine power and perform blood sacrifices as chaotic clerics of their HD. Hierarchs sometimes use their ability to *adjust self*to infiltrate human society in furtherance of some Chaotic end.\n\n###### Spoils\n\nA slain khepri can be harvested for the following components useful in magic research:\n\n* brain (5 5/6 st., 350gp, *greater clairaudience, greater clairvoyance, telepathy*)\n* chitinous crown (5 5/6 st., 350gp, *bewitch monster*)\n* facial ovipositors (5 5/6 st., 350gp, *cone of fear, frighten humanoid, halt humanoid, panic*)\n* embryonic larvae (5 5/6 st., 350gp, *cause disease, enslave humanoid*)\n* mandibles (5 5/6 st., 350gp, *soul eating*)\n* spinal fluid (5 5/6 st., 350gp,*shimmer, levitation, water walking*)\n\nA slain khepri hierarch is even more valuable.
