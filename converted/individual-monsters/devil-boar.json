  "markdown": "### Devil Boar\n\nThe devil boar is a shapeshifting monster capable of transforming between the form of a grotesquely fat human and an immense boar. Though sometimes mistaken for lycanthropic wereboars, devil boars are far more malicious. They delight in the taste of human flesh, and always take residence in or near areas occupied by man so they can easily have people for dinner. They speak the language of the local population, and do not have their own tongue.\n\n###### Combat\n\nIn their human form, devil boars possess a **hypnotic gaze.** A devil boar can use its combat action to hypnotize a humanoid creature within 60’ which is beholding the devil boar. When targeted, the creature must make a Spells saving throw at -2. If the save succeeds, the creature is not affected. If the save fails, the creature is **enslaved** until either the devil boar releases the creature from its control, the devil boar is destroyed, or the effect is dispelled. The devil boar can release an enslaved creature from its control at any time without expending an action. A devil boar can maintain control over no more than one enslaved creatures per HD.\n\nIn their boar form, devil boars have the **acute hearing** and **acute olfaction** of giant boars. They gain a +2 bonus to avoid surprise and can track the scent of creatures for up to 6 miles with the equivalent of three ranks of Tracking.\n\nDevil boars in either form are immune to all mundane damage. However, damage dealt to devil boars by silver weapons is considered to be extraordinary damage.\n\n###### Ecology\n\nWhen devil boars are encountered in their lair, each devil boar has a 75% chance of having 1d3 **enslaved** thralls. Thralls should be rolled up as NPCs using the rules in the ***ACKS II JJ*** (p. XX).\n\nWhile a devil boar can reproduce naturally, producing piglets that mature over many years, most do not typically do so. More often, a devil boar creates more of its kind by feeding a human or demi-human the flesh of his or her spouse, parents, and/or children. Some depraved cultists voluntarily undergo this ritual, but more often the devil boars transform unwitting or unwilling victims. The victim can make a Death saving throw to resist the transformation. If the save fails, the newborn devil boar becomes an obligate cannibal, growing increasingly corpulent with every meal (1 st per day) until he reaches 90 st and becomes a devil boar. The transformation can be halted before completion but only by a *remove curse* cast by a 9th level or higher caster. Once the transformation has occurred, only ritual magic can reverse it.\n\n###### Spoils\n\nA slain devil boar can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the following components useful in magic research:\n\n* blood (11 4/6 st, 700gp, *curse of swine, skinchange*)\n* skin (10 st, 600gp, *deflect ordinary weapons, physical resistance*)\n* tongue (11 4/6 st, 700gp, *bewitch humanoid, dominate humanoid, enslave humanoid*)\n\n![](data:image/png;base64...)\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Devil Boar Primary Characteristics** | |\n| **Type:** | Monstrosity |\n| **Size:** | Large (90 st.) |\n| **Speed (human):** | 40’/120’ or 60’/180’ |\n| **Armor Class:** | 6 (boar form) / 0 (human form) |\n| **Hit Dice:** | 9\\*\\* |\n| **Attacks:** | 1 (gore or weapon 2+) |\n| **Damage:** | 2d6 {P!} or weapon x2 |\n| **Save:** | F9 |\n| **Morale:** | +2 |\n| **Vision:** | Lightless Vision (60’), Night Vision |\n| **Other Senses:** | Acute Hearing, Acute Olfaction |\n| **Proficiencies:** | Listening 8+, Tracking 3+ |\n| **Normal Load:** | 30 st. |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Devil Boar Secondary Characteristics** | |\n| **Expedition Speed:** | 24 or 36 miles |\n| **Supply Cost:** | 16gp (carnivorous) |\n| **Training Period:** | 1 month (sapient) |\n| **Training Modifier:** | None (sapient) |\n| **Battle Rating:** | 2.14 (individual), 128.5 (unit) |\n| **Lifespan:** | 0/1.5/18/23/44/66/88/110 |\n| **Reproduction:** | By infection or as human |\n| **Untrained Value:** | 1,900gp (A) /75gp (J) / 45gp (B) |\n| **Trained Value:** | 51,000gp (sapient) |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Devil Boar Encounter Set-Up** | |\n| **Lair:** | 20% |\n| **Dungeon Enc:** | Sounder (1d4) / Lair (1d4) |\n| **Wilderness Enc:** | Sounder (1d4) / Lair (1d4) |\n| **Alignment:** | Chaotic |\n| **Treasure Type:** | O, L |\n| **XP:** | 2,000 |\n\nA devil boar returns to human form when slain, so its hide and tusks cannot be harvested.\n\n",
