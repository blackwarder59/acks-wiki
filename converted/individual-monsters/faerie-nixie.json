  "markdown": "### Faerie, Nixie\n\nThese water faeries stand 4’ tall and look like beautiful elfin-featured men or women, the former called a nix, the latter a nixie. Their flawless skin is pale with just the slightest silvery sheen, and their expressive eyes are ever-shifting shades of blue. As mercurial as the waters they inhabit, they can be by turns helpful or vicious as the whim takes them.\n\nNixies are found in the northern shores of Aurëpos, particularly in Northern Argollë, Jutland, and Rorn. Though some dwell in Southern Argollë, they are otherwise very rare in the south, where nymphs rather than faeries reign.\n\nThey speak the lilting language of faeries and the languages spoken by dwarves, elves, and humans of their region.\n\n###### Combat\n\nThe music of the nixies is entrancing and magical. As a full-round action, a nixie can sing an **enthralling song**.Once begun, the song continues until the start of the nixie’s next initiative or until it is slain. While a nixie is singing, each enemy creature within earshot (45’ in normal environments) must make a Spells saving throw at the start of its initiative. If more than one nixie sings, the creature suffers a -2 penalty for each additional nixie in earshot.\n\nIf the saving throw succeeds, the creature gains immunity to the effects of every nixie’s enthralling song until the start of its next initiative. If the saving throw fails, the creature becomes **enthralled**. On its initiative, an enthralled creature will move at combat speed towards the nearest nixie that enthralled it; if within 5’ of the nixie, the creature will remain stationary. The creature cannot take full-round actions, combat actions, or even speak, and is **vulnerable** to the nixies’ attacks. If the creature’s movement brings it into water, it starts **drowning**.\n\nA creature remains enthralled until the effect is dispelled, the nixie is slain, or 6 turns elapse. Nixies enjoy dallying with their enthralled victims during this duration. After a nixie has played with her new “toys” for 1d6 turns she will either release them or draw them into water to drown.\n\nBecause their magic can entrance most threats, nixies rarely fight. If forced to do so, they equip themselves with daggers and other tiny weapons. Nixies can also **skinchange** into the form of a light horse once per day. In this shape they explore the land around their lair, playing tricks on any outsiders they come upon.\n\n###### Ecology\n\nWaterfalls, pools, gently flowing rivers: these are the places nixies call home. There they while away the hours singing and playing music.\n\nNixies reproduce by breathing life into elven children who have died of drowning. Grieving elven parents will often take the remains of drowned children to a beautiful lagoon or waterfall where nixies are thought to dwell. The transformations require complex magic rituals performed in places of power on holy days. The newborn nixie remembers his or her old life dimly as if a dream, which fades with time.\n\n![Shape\n\nDescription automatically generated with low confidence](data:image/png;base64...)\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Nixie Primary Characteristics** | |\n| Type: | Enchanted Humanoid |\n| Size: | Man-sized (6 st.) |\n| Speed (land): | 40’ / 120’ or 80’ / 240’ |\n| Speed (swim): | 40’ / 120’ |\n| Armor Class: | 2 |\n| Hit Dice: | 2\\*\\* |\n| Attacks: | 1 (dagger 9+) |\n| Damage: | 1d4 {P!} |\n| Save: | E2 |\n| Morale: | -1 |\n| Vision: | Lightless Vision (60’), Night Vision |\n| Other Senses: | Standard |\n| Proficiencies: | Performance 3 |\n| Normal Load: | 3 st. |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Nixie Secondary Characteristics** | |\n| **Expedition Speed:** | 24 miles (water) or 48 miles (land) |\n| **Supply Cost:** | 0.5gp |\n| **Training Period:** | 1 month (sapient) |\n| **Training Modifier:** | None (sapient) |\n| **Battle Rating:** | 0.508 (individual), 61 (unit) |\n| **Lifespan:** | 0/4/15/51/-/-/-/200 |\n| **Reproduction:** | Special |\n| **Untrained Value:** | 40gp (A)/365gp (J)/ 100gp (B) |\n| **Trained Value:** | 12,000gp |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Nixie Encounter Set-Up** | |\n| Lair: | 85% |\n| Dungeon Enc: | None |\n| Wilderness Enc: | Solitary (1)/ Watery Lair (2d4) |\n| Alignment: | Neutral |\n| Treasure Type: | B |\n| XP: | 38 |\n\n###### Spoils\n\nA slain nixie can be harvested with Healing 1 for the following component:\n\n* vocal cords (3/6 st, 38gp, *angelic choir, bewitch humanoid, skinchange*)\n\n",
