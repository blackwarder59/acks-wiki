Whatever their origin, they are noble creatures with the torsos, arms, and heads of humans and the bodies and legs of horses. Most centaurs in Aurëpos have light olive skin and brown hair and hide, but like the horses and humans they were bred from they can vary wildly in build and coloration. They weigh around 2,100 lbs.\n\nCentaurs combine the skittishness of horses and with the tribalism of humans. As a result, they are quite reclusive, preferring to live far from other races in densely woodlands.\n\nCentaurs speak their own language, which seems to be closely related to Argollëan (Elven). Chieftains and shamans also speak Argollëan, Faerie, and 1d4 other languages.\n\n###### Combat\n\nCentaurs avoid conflict where possible, but the stallions will fight to guard their communities while the mares and foals escape. Centaurs attack by kicking with their two forelegs and striking with a weapon. Their **thick hides** grant a +2 AC bonus.\n\nWhen armed for battle, they typically wear leather armor (for a final AC of 4) and carry oaken clubs and composite bows.\n\n###### Ecology\n\nEach centaur troop will be led by a chieftain in plate armor with 6 AC, 5 HD, 29 hp, and a +2 damage bonus. A chieftain has a 50% chance of possessing Shaman abilities at level 1d6. As long as the chieftain is alive, the centaurs will gain a +2 bonus to morale rolls.\n\nCentaur lairs will have mares and foals equal to 100% and 200% of the number of stallions.
