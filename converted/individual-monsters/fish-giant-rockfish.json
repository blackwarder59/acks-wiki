They can be found anywhere from shallow coastal waters to abyssal depths, but they especially favor rocky outcrops, reefs, and kelp forests in cold water.\n\n###### Combat\n\nGiant rockfish’s scaley bodies closely resemble the rocky sea surface that they call home, and characters encountering the rockfish suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls due to this **natural stealth.**\n\nGiant rockfish rely on a lateral line system that affords them **aquatic mechanoreception**. They can “see” in water up to 300’ by sensing changes in water current and water pressure. Spells or effects that would ordinarily cause blindness do not affect the rockfish while it is using aquatic mechanoreception. However, creatures that are not in the water are invisible to them. Aquatic mechanoreception does not penetrate structures or terrain features.\n\nThe giant rockfish’s spines carry a **deadly venom**. Any creature damaged by a spine must make a Death saving throw. If the save succeeds, the creature is not affected by the venom. If the save fails, the creature dies at the end of the rockfish’s initiative.\n\nIf a creature accidentally steps on or stumbles into a hidden rockfish, the creature is automatically struck by all four spines, each dealing 1d4 x 4 piercing damage and requiring a Death saving throw.\n\n###### Ecology\n\nGiant rockfish do not establish nests or exhibit any parental care for their offspring.
