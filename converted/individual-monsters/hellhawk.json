Its wings, bat-like, with tough and leathery skin stretched between their bones, have a span of 45’. They were crossbred from cacodemons and wyverns by the ancient Zaharans as mounts for their elite ruinguards. Zahar is now a distant memory, but the soul of every hellhawk remains bound by the ancient pacts of their former masters.\n\nHellhawks are semi-sapient. Although incapable of true speech, they can communicate with body posture and vocalizations.\n\n###### Combat\n\nA hellhawk carries the **stench of rotting carrion**, its body so foul that its very life-blood pollutes and destroys the soil. Living creatures that begin their initiative, or move on their initiative to, within 20’ of a hell-hawk must make a Death saving throw become **queasy** from its overwhelming stench. The condition lasts for 1d4+4 rounds after the character leaves the hell-hawk’s vicinity. Zaharans are immune to the stench.\n\nOnce per hour, a hellhawk can utter a **despairing cry** that inflicts dread and horror on all lawful creatures within earshot (60’ in normal environments). Each creature must make a Paralysis saving throw. The effects depend on the intelligence and power of the creature and the result of their saving throw.\n\nIf the save succeeds, creatures with less than 2 HD start **faltering**, while creatures with 2 or more HD are unaffected. A creature that has already faltered becomes **paralyzed** with dread if further affected. The faltered condition ends if removed magically or if the hell hawk is destroyed or goes out of sight.\n\nIf the save fails, creatures with less than 2 HD drop their weapons and become **paralyzed** with dread, while creatures with 2 HD or more are **paralyzed** with dread until the hell hawk attacks. The paralyzed condition ends if removed magically or if the hellhawk is destroyed or goes out of sight. If a creature’s condition ends because the hell hawk goes out of sight, it must make a new saving throw against the effect when the hell hawk returns to sight. (Once a creature succeeded on its saving throw, it does not need to save again when facing that hell hawk.)\n\n###### Ecology\n\nWhen an aerie of hellhawks is encountered, there is a 25% probability that each hawk is guarding offspring. Roll 1d4 for number and age: 1-2, 1d6 eggs, 3-4 1d3 juveniles. Juvenile hellhawks have AC 4, Spd 210’, 3+3 HD, and attack with 2 talons (1d2 {S}) and 1 bite (1d8 {P}). Hellhawk eggs have 1 hp and weigh 1 st. Hellhawks fight to the death to defend their aerie.\n\n###### Spoils\n\nA slain hellhawk can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the following components useful in magic research:\n\n![](data:image/png;base64...)\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Hellhawk Primary Characteristics** | |\n| **Type:** | Monstrosity (bestial) |\n| **Size:** | Huge (150 st.) |\n| **Speed (land):** | 30’ / 90’ |\n| **Speed (fly):** | 80’ / 240’ |\n| **Armor Class:** | 6 |\n| **Hit Dice:** | 7\\*\\* |\n| **Attacks:** | 3 (2 talons, bite 4+) |\n| **Damage:** | 1d6 {S!}/ 1d6 {S!}/ 2d8 {P!} |\n| **Save:** | F7 |\n| **Morale:** | +1 |\n| **Vision:** | Lightless Vision (60’), Night Vision |\n| **Other Senses:** | Standard |\n| **Proficiencies:** | None |\n| **Normal Load:** | 30 st. |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Hellhawk Secondary Characteristics** | |\n| **Expedition Speed:** | 96 miles (air) or 18 miles (land) |\n| **Supply Cost:** | 24gp (carnivorous) |\n| **Training Period:** | 6 months |\n| **Training Modifier:** | +3 (semi-sapient) |\n| **Battle Rating:** | 1.348 (individual), 27 (unit) |\n| **Lifespan:** | E/2/4/6/100/155/210/270 |\n| **Reproduction:** | 1d6 eggs every 8 years |\n| **Untrained Value:** | 1,150gp (A)/3,550gp (J)/ 1,900gp (E) |\n| **Trained Value:** | 36,000gp (war mount) |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Hellhawk Encounter Set-Up** | |\n| **Lair:** | 30% |\n| **Dungeon Enc:** | Flight (1d2) / Aerie (1d6) |\n| **Wilderness Enc:** | Wing (1d6) / Aerie (1d6) |\n| **Alignment:** | Chaotic |\n| **Treasure Type:** | I, M |\n| **XP:** | 1,140 |\n\n* vocal chords (10 st, 600gp, *cone of fear, inspire horror, panic*)\n* wing-tips (9 st., 540gp, *striking, swift sword, winged flight*)\n\nHellhawks will readily permit themselves to be tamed and trained by Zaharans, for whom they have a training period of only 2 months.\n\n",
