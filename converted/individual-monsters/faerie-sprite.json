  "markdown": "### Faerie, Sprite\n\nSprites are reclusive fey creatures that appear as 1' tall winged elves. They delight in dancing and frolicking and giggle as often as they speak. Sprites are not malicious, but are mischievous, and enjoy playing tricks on other creatures.\n\nLike other faeries, sprites are found primarily in northern Aurëpos, particularly in Northern Argollë, Jutland, and Rorn. Though some dwell in Southern Argollë, they are otherwise very rare in the south, where nymphs rather than faeries are found.\n\nSprites speak the lilting language of faeries and the languages spoken by gnomes, halflings, and humans of their region.\n\n###### Combat\n\nEvery sprite can use *bestow curse* as a spell-like ability once per day. The curse will never cause physical harm or illness, but will instead be embarrassing or humorous. The Judge can roll 1d10 on the Sprite Curse table or devise their own.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Roll (1d10) | Curse |\n| 1 | Skin becomes dotted or striped |\n| 2 | Ears grow into donkey ears |\n| 3 | Voice transform into that of a little girl |\n| 4 | Suffers hair loss in an embarrassing pattern |\n| 5 | Must always tell the truth no matter what |\n| 6 | Speaks all his words and sentences backward |\n| 7 | Develops a speech impediment (lisp, etc) |\n| 8 | Randomly punctuates speech with profanity |\n| 9 | Becomes obsessed with counting things |\n| 10 | Thinks he is a vampire, fears daylight, garlic |\n\nThe curse lasts indefinitely until cured with *remove curse*, the sprite stops sustaining the curse, or the sprite sustaining it is slain.\n\nSprites do not carry weapons or fight. If attacked, they will scatter in flight to hide.\n\n###### Ecology\n\nSprites dwell in tiny smials (civilized burrows) that resemble those of halflings. However, the structure of the smials never quite makes sense, as if it were built in imitation of the appearance without an understanding of the function. They have doors that do not open, staircases that lead nowhere, etc.\n\nThey reproduce by transforming abandoned, orphaned, and/or unloved gnomish or halfling children into their own kind in magic rituals performed in places of power on holy days. The children remember their old life dimly as if a dream, which fades with time.\n\nThey never steal children from loving parents. Nevertheless, gnomish and halfling mothers frequently warn naughty toddlers that they’ll be carried off by the sprites if they misbehave.\n\n![](data:image/png;base64...)\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Sprite Primary Characteristics** | |\n| **Type:** | Enchanted Humanoid |\n| **Size:** | Small (1/2 st.) |\n| **Speed (land):** | 20’ / 60’ |\n| **Speed (fly):** | 60’ / 180' |\n| **Armor Class:** | 4 |\n| **Hit Dice:** | 1/2\\* (1d4 hit points) |\n| **Attacks:** | 1 curse |\n| **Damage:** | See entry |\n| **Save:** | E1 |\n| **Morale:** | -1 |\n| **Vision:** | Lightless Vision (60’) |\n| **Other Senses:** | Standard |\n| **Proficiencies:** | None |\n| **Normal Load:** | 0 st. |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Sprite Secondary Characteristics** | |\n| **Expedition Speed:** | 72 miles (air) or 12 miles (land) |\n| **Supply Cost:** | 0.5gp |\n| **Training Period:** | 1 month (sapient) |\n| **Training Modifier:** | None (sapient) |\n| **Battle Rating:** | 0.010 (individual), 1.5 (unit) |\n| **Lifespan:** | 0/4/15/51/-/-/-/200 |\n| **Reproduction:** | Special |\n| **Untrained Value:** | 6gp (A)/7.5gp (J)/2gp (B) |\n| **Trained Value:** | 250gp |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Sprite Encounter Set-Up** | |\n| **Lair:** | 30% |\n| **Dungeon Enc:** | None |\n| **Wilderness Enc:** | Wing (3d6) / Fastness (3d6) |\n| **Alignment:** | Neutral |\n| **Treasure Type:** | B |\n| **XP:** | 6 |\n\n###### Spoils\n\nA slain sprite can be harvested with Healing 1 for the following component:\n\n* tongue (1 per 20 st., 3gp, *bath of goddess, bestow curse*)\n* wings (1 per 20 st., 13gp, *shrinking, winged flight*)\n\n",
