Bugbears stand about 7’6” tall and weigh about 400 lbs.\n\n###### Combat\n\nBugbears are **formidable warriors** and receive a +1 damage bonus. Despite their bulk, they are **naturally stealthy**, so characters encountering bugbears suffer a -1 penalty to surprise rolls. They rely on their **shaggy hides** for armor, which grant a +3 bonus to armor class.\n\nUnless special troops are present (p. XX), 50% of gangs or warbands encountered will be archers (round up), 50% will be warriors (round down). Bugbear warriors are equipped with spear, battle axe, and shield. Some bugbear tribes field warriors equipped with hide armor and morning star. All bugbear archers are equipped with hide armor, short bow, 20 arrows, and battle axe.\n\n###### Ecology\n\nEach bugbear gang will be led by a champion with 5 AC, 4+1 HD, 25 hp, and a +3 damage bonus. Each bugbear warband will be led by a sub-chieftain with 6 AC, 5+1 HD, 29 hp, and a +3 damage bonus. A bugbear lair or village will be led by a chieftain with 7 AC, 7+2 HD, 37 hp, and a +4 damage bonus. As long as the chieftain is alive, the bugbears will gain a +2 bonus to morale rolls.\n\nBugbear lairs and villages will have drudges and whelps equal to 100% and 200% of the number of warriors each. Bugbear drudges fight as hobgoblins, while bugbear whelps fight as kobolds.\n\nWhen bugbears are encountered in a village, certain additional creatures may be present. There is a 60% chance a bugbear village will be guarded by 2d6 trained cave bears. There is a 50% chance for 1d10 enslaved captives per warband. In addition, a bugbear village has a 75% chance of a shaman being present, and a 50% chance of a witch doctor. A shaman is equivalent to a sub-chieftain statistically, but has Shaman abilities at level 1d6.
