  "markdown": "### Baboon, Rock\n\nThese black-haired black-eyed baboons are found throughout Ulruk and as far north as the Dark Wall in Southern Argollë. They stand 4’6” tall and weigh 230lbs, though the largest strongest males can reach 6’ in height.\n\nRock baboons are highly intelligent animals capable of forming plans and using tools. While they do not have a true language, rock baboons can plead, threaten, and warn other creatures with cries, screams, and gestures. They are omnivores that often hunt for meat.\n\n###### Combat\n\nUnlike most apes, rock baboons are highly aggressive, and are easily stimulated to fight (-1 penalty to reaction rolls). In combat, they both bite and use sticks as clubs.\n\nBaboons are very agile and strong, capable of easily scaling trees or rocks and leaping across ledges or branches. They can climb as if they were 5th level thieves and jump as if they had 18 DEX.\n\n###### Ecology\n\nWhen rock baboons are encountered in their den, the adults will be raising 3d6-3 juvenile baboons and 2d6-2 baby baboons. Juvenile rock baboons have Speed 90’, AC 1, 1 HD, and attack with a bite (1 piercing damage). Infant baboons have Spd 90’, AC 0, 1 hp, ML -4, and do not fight.\n\n###### Spoils\n\nA slain rock baboon with exceptional attributes can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following components useful in magic research:\n\n* skull (2/6 st, 20gp, *frighten beast, speak with beasts*)\n\nA rock baboon's pelt fetches 25gp and weighs 4/6 st.\n\n###### Encounter\n\nHigh atop the trees of a rugged, broken landscape, **15 rock baboons** keep watch day and night for any intruders to their den. They patrol between the treetops and the large cliffs, calling out to one another with high-pitched howls and screeches. If anyone encroaches, the seven largest baboons will attack, leaping down on them from the upper branches of the trees. The remaining baboons will hang back to protect the young, consisting of **5 juveniles** and **7 babies**. The baboons have no treasure, but tall, colorful spikes of finger-like flowers grow thickly along the rocky slopes where they live.
