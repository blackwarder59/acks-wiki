  "markdown": "### Gorilla, Cave\n\nThese omnivorous primates are sometimes called white apes because of their pale skin, pink eyes, and thick white hair covering their 6’-tall 360lbs frames. Cave gorillas have adapted to living in the underdark below Aurëpos, only venturing to the surface to forage for food at night.\n\nCave gorillas live in bands led by the biggest, strongest male. While they do not have a true language, they can plead, threaten, and warn other creatures with cries, screams, and gestures.\n\nAdventurers who have explored the jungles of Ulruk claim that there are many other types of gorillas, similar to the cave gorillas of Aurëpos in characteristics, but with colors ranging from brownish-grey to silver and black.\n\n###### Combat\n\nCave gorillas will roar and thump their chests at creatures they encounter, but do not typically attack unless the creature approaches their lair. Characters encountering cave gorillas away from their den gain a +1 bonus to reaction rolls. If forced to fight, they attack with their vicious claws or throw rocks.\n\n###### Ecology\n\nWhen cave gorillas are encountered in their den, the adults will be rearing 1d4-1 juvenile cave gorillas and 1d4-1 baby gorillas. Juvenile cave gorillas have AC 1, Spd 90’, 2 HD, and attack with two claws (1d2 {S}). Baby gorillas have AC 0, Spd 90’, HD 1, and attack with two scritches (1 {S}).\n\n###### Spoils\n\nA slain cave gorilla with exceptional attributes can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following component:\n\n* skull (1 2/6 st, 80gp, *speak with beasts, sling stone*)\n\nA cave gorilla's pelt fetches 50gp and weighs 1 st.\n\nCave gorillas themselves are easily trained if captured while young, and many races of humanoids use them as guards and servants.\n\n###### Lore\n\n*The cave gorilla is nowhere more prevalent than in Southern Argollë.
