  "markdown": "### Beastman, Gnoll\n\nGnolls are chaotic beastmen allegedly bred by the ancient Zaharans during the Empyrean War to battle elven forces. Some sages believe gnolls descend from hybrids of men and hyenas, while others insist they were bred from gnomes and trolls. Whatever the case, an adult gnoll is a fearsome creature standing about 7’6” tall and 300 lbs with dirty yellow or reddish-brown fur. Gnolls prefer to be carnivorous, favoring intelligent creatures for food because they scream more, though gnolls themselves are not particularly intelligent.\n\n###### Combat\n\nGnolls are **formidable warriors** and receive a +1 damage bonus. They benefit from **shaggy hides** which, though not as thick as bugbear hides, still grant a +1 bonus to armor class.\n\nUnless special troops are present (p. XX), 50% of gangs or warbands encountered will be archers (round up), 50% will be warriors (round down). Most gnoll warriors are equipped with leather armor, spear, battle axe, and shield. Some gnoll tribes field warriors equipped with scale armor and morning star, pole arm, or two-handed sword. All gnoll archers are equipped with scale, long bow, 20 arrows, and battle axe.\n\n###### Ecology\n\nEach gnoll gang will be led by a champion with 5 AC, 3 HD, 16 hp, and a +2 damage bonus. Each gnoll warband will be led by a sub-chieftain with 6 AC, 4 HD, 20 hp, and a +2 damage bonus. A gnoll lair or village will be led by a chieftain with 7 AC, 6 HD, 28 hp, and a +3 damage bonus. As long as the chieftain is alive, the gnolls will gain a +2 bonus to morale rolls.\n\nGnoll lairs and villages will have drudges and whelps equal to 100% and 200% of the number of warriors, respectively. Gnoll drudges fight as orcs. Gnoll whelps have Spd 60’, AC 0, 1 hp, ML -4, and do not fight.\n\nWhen gnolls are encountered in a village, certain additional creatures will be present. There is a 33% chance a gnoll village will be guarded by 1d3 trolls and another 66% chance for 4d4 trained hyenas. There is a 50% chance for 1d10 enslaved captives per warband. In addition, a village has a 60% chance of a shaman being present, and a 50% chance of a witch doctor. A shaman is equivalent to sub-chieftain statistically, but has Shaman abilities at level 1d4+1. A witch doctor is equivalent to a champion statistically, but has Mage abilities at level 1d4.\n\n###### Spoils\n\nA slain gnoll can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 2 for the following component:\n\n* canine teeth (1/6 st, 20gp, *beguile humanoid*)\n\n![](data:image/png;base64...)\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Gnoll Primary Characteristics** | |\n| **Type:** | Humanoid Beastman |\n| **Size:** | Man-sized (30 st.) |\n| **Speed:** | 30’ / 90’ |\n| **Armor Class:** | 4 |\n| **Hit Dice:** | 2 |\n| **Attacks:** | 1 (weapon 9+) |\n| **Damage:** | By weapon +1 |\n| **Save:** | F2 |\n| **Morale:** | 0 |\n| **Vision:** | Lightless Vision (30’) |\n| **Other Senses:** | Standard |\n| **Proficiencies:** | None |\n| **Normal Load:** | 10 st. |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Gnoll Secondary Characteristics** | |\n| **Expedition Speed:** | 18 miles |\n| **Supply Cost:** | 0.5gp |\n| **Training Period:** | 1 month (sapient) |\n| **Training Modifier:** | None (sapient) |\n| **Battle Rating:** | 0.029 – 0.051 (ind.), 3.5 –6 (unit) |\n| **Lifespan:** | 0/1.15/14/18.5/34/51/68/85 |\n| **Reproduction:** | 1 whelp per 15 months |\n| **Untrained Value:** | 80p (A) / 28gp (J) / 20gp (B) |\n| **Trained Value:** | 675gp or more (sapient) |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Gnoll Encounters** | |\n| **Lair:** | 20% |\n| **Dungeon Enc:** | Gang (1d6) / Lair (1 warband) |\n| **Wilderness Enc:** | Warband (1d6 gangs) /  Village (1d10 warbands) |\n| **Alignment:** | Chaotic |\n| **Treasure Type:** | G (per warband) |\n| **XP:** | 20 (warrior), 50 (champion), 80 (sub-chieftain), 440 (chieftain) |\n\n",
