Close relatives to the true giants, their origins are unknown to even the wisest sages. According to adventurers who have encountered them, cyclopes are somewhat childlike, having both the cruelty and credulous of pubescent boys. They often keep flocks of sheep and sometimes cultivate grapes, dwelling in nearby caves that overlook their flocks and vineyards.\n\nCyclops speak the bombastic, booming language of giants. They can also speak simple words and phrases in Common.\n\n###### Combat\n\nIn combat, cyclopes can smash with their fists or with weapons. When smashing with piercing or slashing weapons, cyclopes deliver **vicious blows** that deal an additional 4 points per smash. When smashing with bludgeoning weapons, cyclopes can **topple and fling** man-sized or smaller creatures with every attack. A small or man-sized creature struck by a cyclops’s smash must make a size-adjusted Paralysis saving throw or be knocked prone and forced back a number of feet equal to the damage dealt. If this would push the creature into a wall or obstacle, the creature takes 1d6 points of damage per 10’ he has traveled. If the creature is pushed into another character or monster, he is halted. If the character or monster he is pushed into is smaller, the character/monster is instead knocked down, and the opponent continues to be forced back. A cyclops can cleave after a successful smash that forces back its target.\n\nInstead of smashing, cyclops can **hurl boulders** to a distance of 900’, dealing 3d6 bludgeoning damage in a 5’ radius to the impact point. When hurling a boulder, a giant functions like a heavy ballista using the rules for Missile Attacks with Artillery (***ACKS II RR****,* p. XX). However, because they have reduced depth perception, they suffer a -2 penalty to the attack throw. The cyclops has no minimum range and does not need to reload, so it can throw a boulder each round it has sufficient ammunition.\n\nA cyclops has a 10% chance to have the ability to *bestow curse* as a spell-like ability once per week.\n\n###### Ecology\n\nCyclops are loners, and live together in small numbers only on occasion. When 2 or more cyclops are encountered in a lair, they have a 25% chance to be a family. (If not, they are just a bachelor gang.) A cyclopes family consists of 2 adults and up to one juvenile and one baby cyclops. Juvenile cyclops have AC 2, Spd 60’, HD 6+2, and attack with 1 smash (1d10 {B}). Baby cyclops have AC 1, Spd 60’, HD 4+1, and attack with 1 smash (1d4 {B}).\n\n###### Spoils\n\nA slain cyclops can be harvested with Healing for the following component:\n\n* eye (23 2/6 st, 1,400gp, *bestow curse, clairvoyance, scry,* armor +1, weapon +3*)*\n\nIf a cyclops family is encountered, up to 50% of the value can be in livestock or wine. Bachelor gangs have ordinary treasure.\n\n![](data:image/png;base64...)\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Cyclops Primary Characteristics** | |\n| **Type:** | Giant |\n| **Size:** | Huge (580 st.) |\n| **Speed (land):** | 30’ / 90’ |\n| **Armor Class:** | 4 |\n| **Hit Dice:** | 13 |\n| **Attacks:** | 1 (smash -2+ or throw 0+) |\n| **Damage:** | 3d10 {W!} or 3d6 {B!} |\n| **Save:** | F13 |\n| **Morale:** | +1 |\n| **Vision:** | Lightless Vision (60’) |\n| **Other Senses:** | Standard |\n| **Proficiencies:** | Animal Husbandry, Labor (vintner) |\n| **Normal Load:** | 99 st. |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Cyclops Secondary Characteristics** | |\n| **Expedition Speed:** | 18 miles |\n| **Supply Cost:** | 12gp |\n| **Training Period:** | 1 month (sapient) |\n| **Training Modifier:** | None (sapient) |\n| **Battle Rating:** | 1.134 (individual), 22.5 (unit) |\n| **Lifespan:** | 0/2.5/30/39/73/110/146/182.5 |\n| **Reproduction:** | 1 whelp per 5 years |\n| **Untrained Value:** | 1,400gp (A) / 215gp (J) / 100gp (B) |\n| **Trained Value:** | 27,000gp (sapient) |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Cyclops Encounter Set-Up** | |\n| **Lair:** | 20% |\n| **Dungeon Enc:** | Solitary (1) / Lair (1d4) |\n| **Wilderness Enc:** | Gang (1d4) / Lair (1d4) |\n| **Alignment:** | Chaotic |\n| **Treasure Type:** | O |\n| **XP:** | 1,400 |\n\n",
