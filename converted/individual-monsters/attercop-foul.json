  "markdown": "### Attercop, Foul\n\nFoul attercops are remote relatives of the demonic attercops, the demonic ichor having greatly weakened through hundreds of generations of breeding with giant spiders of the mortal sort. These creatures are 5’ long and weigh about 125 lbs. Like their progenitors, these arachnid horrors dwell in the fetid swamps, dark forests, and high mountains of the wild.\n\nAttercops are sapient and speak their own horrific language. Scholars who have studied Ancient Zaharan, Khepri, and Thrassian find certain similarities in the attercop tongue.\n\n###### Combat\n\nFoul attercops are ambush predators, and creatures encountering attercops suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls due to the spiders’ **natural stealth**.\n\nTheir bites carry a dangerous **paralytic venom.** A creature damaged by a foul attercop’s bite must make a Death saving throw with a +2 bonus. If the save succeeds, the creature is not affected by the venom. If the save fails, then creature suffers 2d6 {P} damage and becomes **paralyzed** for 2d4 turns at the end of the attercop’s initiative. The paralysis can be cured by *neutralize poison* but not *cure light injury.* When the paralysis wears off, the poisoned creature is **fatigued**. The fatigue ends if the poison is neutralized or after the creature enjoys 8 hours of restful sleep.\n\nTo aid in ambush, attercops spin webs in strategic locations around their lairs. They use these webs to entangle victims in their webs in order to capture them and keep them fresh for later consumption. They can also spin a web around a target as a melee attack. If a creature moves into an attercop’s web, or if an attercop succeeds on a webspinning attack throw against a creature, that creature becomes **webbed.**\n\nThe foul attercops’ **webbed mechanoreception** enables them to “see” any creatures touching their webs.\n\n###### Ecology\n\nFoul attercops can reproduce with any other attercops; the mother determines the resultant offspring. When encountered in a den, there is a 10% chance per foul attercop that it will be guarding a clutch of 2d4 eggs. Foul attercop eggs have 1 hp and weigh 1/6 st.\n\n###### Spoils\n\nA slain foul attercop can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the following components useful in magic research:\n\n* mandibles (1/6 st, 12gp, *poison*)\n* leg tarsus (1/6 st, 12gp, *spider climb*)\n* spinneret (2/6 st, 16gp, *chameleon, webbing*)\n\nIf not used for magic research, a foul attercop’s mandibles fetch 8gp and weigh 1/6 st. Its venom (onset time of 1 turn, +6 saving modifier, paralysis for 1d4 turns and 1d6 {Po} damage on failed Death saving throw) fetches 125gp and weighs 1/6 st.\n\n![](data:image/png;base64...)\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Foul Attercop Primary Characteristics** | |\n| **Type:** | Monstrosity (sapient) |\n| **Size:** | Man-sized (12 st.) |\n| **Speed (land):** | 20’ / 60’ |\n| **Speed (web):** | 40’ / 120’ |\n| **Armor Class:** | 2 |\n| **Hit Dice:** | 2\\*\\* |\n| **Attacks:** | 1 (bite or web 9+) |\n| **Damage:** | 1d8 {P} + poison or web |\n| **Save:** | F2 |\n| **Morale:** | -1 |\n| **Vision:** | Lightless Vision (60’) |\n| **Other Senses:** | Webbed Mechanoreception |\n| **Proficiencies:** | None |\n| **Normal Load:** | 15 st. |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Foul Attercop Secondary Characteristics** | |\n| **Expedition Speed:** | 12 miles |\n| **Supply Cost:** | 2gp (carnivorous) |\n| **Training Period:** | 1 month (sapient) |\n| **Training Modifier:** | None (sapient) |\n| **Battle Rating:** | 0.148 (individual), 17 (unit) |\n| **Lifespan:** | E/1/17/67/105/160/210/265 |\n| **Reproduction:** | 2d4 eggs every 5 years |\n| **Untrained Value:** | 165gp (A)/245gp (J)/175gp (E) |\n| **Trained Value:** | 3,385gp (sapient) |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Foul Attercop Encounter Set-Up** | |\n| **Lair:** | 70% |\n| **Dungeon Enc:** | Clutter (1d4) / Den (1d4) |\n| **Wilderness Enc:** | Clutter (1d4) / Den (1d4) |\n| **Alignment:** | Chaotic |\n| **Treasure Type:** | B / 2 |\n| **XP:** | 38 |\n\n",
