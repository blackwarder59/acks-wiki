  "markdown": "### Giant, Hill\n\nGiants are mighty creatures that compare in stature to humans as humans compare to halflings. Unlike beastmen, ogres, and trolls, which were bred by the evil alchemy of the Zaharans, giants have existed since time immemorial, and not all giants are wicked. Some giants are more or less decent, and have even assisted adventurers from time to time in his various purposes. Most, however, are as cruel as they are stupid, and delight to eat the flesh of men.\n\nHill giants stand 15’ tall and weigh about 2,450 lbs. They have skin of rust brown or tan with ruddy or black hair. They dress in animal skins and typically wield crudely-hewn clubs and spears in battle.\n\nGiants of all types share a bombastic language. Hill giants also can speak simple words and phrases in Common.\n\n###### Combat\n\nIn combat, hill giants can smash with their fists or with weapons. When smashing with piercing or slashing weapons, giants deliver **vicious blows** that deal an additional 4 points per smash. When smashing with bludgeoning weapons, giants can **topple and fling** large or smaller creatures with every attack (p. XX). The creature struck must make a successful size-adjusted Paralysis saving throw or be knocked prone and forced back a number of feet equal to the damage dealt. The giant can cleave if the creature fails its save against his smash.\n\nInstead of smashing, hill giants can **hurl boulders** to a distance of 1200’, dealing 3d6 {B!} damage in a 5’ radius to the impact point. When hurling a boulder, a giant functions like a heavy ballista using the rules for Missile Attacks with Artillery (***ACKS II RR****,* p. XX). However, the giant does not need to reload, so it can throw a boulder each round if it has sufficient ammo.\n\n###### Ecology\n\nHill giants live in the moors and highlands below the Jutting and Meniri Mountains. Sometimes they lair in natural caverns, others in huts or steadings of mud, wattle, or wood.\n\nWhen hill giants are encountered in a dungeon lair or wilderness warband, they have a 25% chance to be accompanied by trained animals. When encountered in a wilderness lair, they are always accompanied by trained creatures. If trained creatures are present, roll 1d10 to determine type and number: 1-5, 4d6 dire wolves; 6-10, 3d6 cave bears.\n\nAdventurers usually encounter small bands of giants who have made their way into civilized realms to raid and plunder. Rumors and tall-tales speak of colossal steadings high in the mountains filled with dozens or even hundreds of hill giants with entire clans led by great chiefs. If such a steading were to exist, it would surely be a challenge for even great heroes.\n\n![](data:image/png;base64...)\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Hill Giant Primary Characteristics** | |\n| **Type:** | Giant |\n| **Size:** | Huge (245 st.) |\n| **Speed (land):** | 40’ / 120’ |\n| **Armor Class:** | 5 |\n| **Hit Dice:** | 8 |\n| **Attacks:** | 1 (smash 3+ or throw 3+) |\n| **Damage:** | 2d8 {W!} or 3d6 {B!} |\n| **Save:** | F8 |\n| **Morale:** | 0 |\n| **Vision:** | Lightless Vision (60’) |\n| **Other Senses:** | Standard |\n| **Proficiencies:** | None |\n| **Normal Load:** | 55 st. |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Hill Giant Secondary Characteristics** | |\n| **Expedition Speed:** | 24 miles |\n| **Supply Cost:** | 6gp |\n| **Training Period:** | 1 month (sapient) |\n| **Training Modifier:** | None (sapient) |\n| **Battle Rating:** | 0.659 (monster), 13 (unit) |\n| **Lifespan:** | 0/1.5/18.5/25/46/69/92/115 |\n| **Reproduction:** | 1 baby per 6 years |\n| **Untrained Value:** | 600gp(A)/85gp (J)/ 50gp(B) |\n| **Trained Value:** | 15,650gp |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Hill Giant Encounter Set-Up** | |\n| **Lair:** | 25% |\n| **Dungeon Enc:** | Gang (1d4) / Lair (2d4) |\n| **Wilderness Enc:** | Warband (2d4) / Lair (2d4) |\n| **Alignment:** | Chaotic |\n| **Treasure Type:** | N |\n| **XP:** | 600 |\n\n###### Spoils\n\nA slain hill giant can be harvested with Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the following component:\n\n* pituitary gland (600gp, 10 st, *battering ram, sling stone*, armor +1, weapon +2)\n\n",
