The dwarves claim that the elves of southern Argollë bred them, but the elves hotly dispute this. All agree that lizardmen once had a powerful empire centered on the city of Thrassia, from which they which dominated southern Aurëpos and eastern Ulruk. In the centuries since they have degenerated to a state of primitive savagery.\n\nAdult lizardmen stand 6' to 7' tall, resembling humans with the heads, claws, scales, and tails of lizards. They are sometimes found in dungeons, especially if there is an aquatic entrance. They otherwise dwell in lagoons, marshes, swamps and similar wetlands.\n\nLizardmen speak their own language, a degenerate form of Ancient Thrassian.

A lizardman lair will be led by a chieftain with 7 AC, 6+2 HD, 30 hp, and a +3 damage bonus (+2 with its natural attacks). As long as the chieftain is alive, the lizardmen will gain a +2 bonus to morale rolls. Lizardmen lairs will have drudges and eggs equal to 100% and 100% of the number of warriors.

A lizardman village has a 75% chance of a shaman being present, and a 50% chance of a witch doctor. A shaman is equivalent to a sub-chieftain statistically, but has Shaman abilities at level 1d6.
