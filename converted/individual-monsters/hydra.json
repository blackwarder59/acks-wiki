  "markdown": "### Hydra\n\nHydras are vicious semi-sapient monstrosities with up to 12 heads. They have skin shaded gray-brown to dark brown, with a light yellow or tan underbelly, eyes of amber, and yellow-white teeth. An average hydra is 20' long and weighs about 3,400 to 4,800 lbs, depending on its heads.\n\n###### Combat\n\nWhen a hydra is encountered, it will have 1d8+4 heads. A hydra with less than 12 heads will have cauterized stumps visible where the missing heads used to be.\n\nHydras have a number of Hit Die equal to their current number of heads, with maximum hit points on each Hit Die. A hydra saves as a fighter equal in level to the hydra’s Hit Dice. Each head can bite an opponent each round, so the number of attacks a hydra has each round is equal to the number of heads it has.\n\nWhen a hydra suffers 8 damage, one head is destroyed. For each additional 8 damage, another head is destroyed. When all heads have been destroyed, the hydra dies. Destroying one of a hydra’s heads does not trigger a cleave.\n\nHowever, a hydra’s destroyed heads can quickly **regenerate**. At the end of its next initiative, a hydra that has lost one or more heads in the preceding round will grow 2 new heads for each lost head, subject to a maximum possible 12 heads. Heads destroyed by fire damage do not regenerate. Heads destroyed by other damage can be prevented from regenerating by **cauterizing** the stumps with fire or acid before they re-grow. Cauterizing a stump is a combat action that requires a successful attack throw against the hydra at a -4 penalty to work. A character cannot cleave after cauterizing. Each cauterized stump reduces the hydra’s maximum heads.\n\n###### Ecology\n\nHydra are found in bogs, marshes, swamps, and other wetlands. They are solitary creatures, always dwelling alone. They reproduce by budding: every two decades, a tubular outgrowth or “bud” begins to develop on the hydra’s body. The bud develops into a tiny version of the adult hydra with multiple tiny heads and limbs. When encountered, a hydra has a 5% chance to have a bud visibly growing on it.\n\nAfter about a year, the bud detaches, becoming a hydralet (baby hydra). Hydralets quickly leave the lair to avoid being cannibalized by their parent.\n\n###### Spoils\n\nA slain hydra can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the following components useful in magic research:\n\n* blood (11 4/6 st, 700gp, *cure injury, longevity, trollblood, water breathing*)\n* scales (11 4/6 st, 700gp, *repair disability & disfigurement, restore life & limb*)\n* set of skulls (11 4/6 st,700gp, *swift strike*)\n\n![](data:image/png;base64...)\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Hydra Primary Characteristics** | |\n| **Type:** | Monstrosity (bestial) |\n| **Size:** | Huge (340 – 480 st.) |\n| **Speed (land):** | 40’ / 120’ |\n| **Speed (swim):** | 20’ / 60’ |\n| **Armor Class:** | 4 |\n| **Hit Dice:** | 5 to 12\\* |\n| **Attacks:** | As head number (bite -1 to 6+) |\n| **Damage:** | 1d10 {P!} |\n| **Save:** | F5 to F12 |\n| **Morale:** | +2 |\n| **Vision:** | Lightless Vision (60’), Night Vision |\n| **Other Senses:** | Standard |\n| **Proficiencies:** | None |\n| **Normal Load:** | 68 – 96 st. |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Hydra Secondary Characteristics** | |\n| **Expedition Speed:** | 24 miles |\n| **Supply Cost:** | 48gp (carnivorous) |\n| **Training Period:** | 4 months |\n| **Training Modifier:** | +3 (semi-sapient) |\n| **Battle Rating:** | 0.178 – 0.536 (ind.), 3.5 – 10 (unit) |\n| **Lifespan:** | 0/1.5/9/20/-/-/-/1000+ |\n| **Reproduction:** | 1 budding hydralet per 20 years |\n| **Untrained Value:** | 5,325gp (A) / 1,600gp (J) / 1,000gp (B) |\n| **Trained Value:** | 12,150gp (guard) |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Hydra Encounter Set-Up** | |\n| **Lair:** | 20% |\n| **Dungeon Enc:** | Solitary (1) / Lair (1) |\n| **Wilderness Enc:** | Solitary (1) / Lair (1) |\n| **Alignment:** | Neutral |\n| **Treasure Type:** | I (5-7 HD, K (8-9 HD) or M (10-12 HD) |\n| **XP:** | 350-2,100 |\n\nThe spoils, untrained value, and trained value are for a 12 headed hydra.
