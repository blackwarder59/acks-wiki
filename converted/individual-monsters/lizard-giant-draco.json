They are particularly commonly in the jungles of Somirea and Ulruk, but have also been known to take up residence in warm, humid caves and dungeons.\n\n###### Combat\n\nGiant draco lizards prefer to attack from above. They are also **skilled climbers** able to ascend sheer surfaces as if they were thieves (6+). Once they have perched on a high branch or rocky outcropping, they wait for prey to pass by, then glide down and snatch it.\n\n###### Ecology\n\nWhen a wilderness lair of giant geckos is encountered, there is a 25% chance per lizard that it will have buried a clutch of 1d4+1 eggs nearby. The eggs have 1 hp and weight 1/6 st. Draco hatchlings are rarely found in nests, because the creatures immediately disperse into the wild after they emerge from their eggs.\n\n###### Spoils\n\nA slain giant draco can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following component:\n\n* wings (2 2/6 st, 140gp, *leaping,* armor +1)\n\nFrom time to time, enterprising adventurers attempt to capture and rear giant draco lizards.
