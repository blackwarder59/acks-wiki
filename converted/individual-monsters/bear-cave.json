Humans and demi-humans suffer a -2 reaction roll penalty when encountering them.\n\nThe fierce beasts have **acute olfaction** and gain a +1 bonus to avoid surprise in their natural habitat. They can track the scent of creatures for up to 6 miles with the equivalent of three ranks of Tracking proficiency.
