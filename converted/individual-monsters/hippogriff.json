  "markdown": "### Hippogriff\n\nHippogriffs are aggressive flying creatures crossbred from eagles and horses. Their forebody, front legs, head, and wings are those of a giant eagle while their hindquarters, hind legs, and tail are those of a horse. A typical hippogriff weighs around 1,000 lbs and measures 9' long with a wingspan of 25'. Voracious omnivores, hippogriffs have a particular taste for pegasi meat, but will hunt humanoids as readily as any other meal. As semi-sapient horse hybrids, they are much easier to train than griffons.\n\n###### Combat\n\nLike eagles, hippogriffs have **acute vision** and **alertness**, granting them a +2 bonus to avoid surprise in their natural habitat.\n\nA flying hippogriff can make a **dive attack** with its talons. A dive attack inflict double the normal damage (2d6 {S}/2d6 {S}).
