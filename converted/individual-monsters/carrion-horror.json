Spells or effects that would ordinarily cause blindness do not affect the creature when using terrestrial mechanoreception. However, creatures that are flying, levitating, or otherwise not touching the ground are invisible to the sense. Terrestrial mechanoreception can penetrate structures and terrain features.\n\nIf a carrion horror damages a creature with a stinger, the creature must make a Paralysis save against its venom. If the save succeeds, the creature is unaffected by the poison. If the save fails, the creature is **paralyzed** at the end of the carrion horror’s initiative. A carrion horror’s paralysis can be cured with *cure injury* or *neutralize poison.* Otherwise, it lasts for 2d4 turns.\n\nThe carrion horror can instinctively identify when its venom has paralyzed a creature, enabling it to continue to attack an opponent that resists its venom or turn its attention to other threats if it succumbs.\n\nIf not engaged by another opponent, a carcass scavenger can devour a paralyzed creature of man-size or less as its combat action.
