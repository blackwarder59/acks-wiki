They can track the scent of creatures for up to 6 miles with the equivalent of three ranks of Tracking proficiency.\n\nTheir **lightning reflexes** grant a +1 bonus to initiative. They are **naturally stealthy** when in their native habitat, and creatures encountering them suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls.\n\nIf a cheetah charges a creature and successfully hits it with both claws, it immediately **pounces** onthe creature. The cat’s subsequent bite attack automatically hits and the creature that has been pounced on must make a successful size-adjusted Paralysis saving throw or be knocked **prone**.\n\nCheetahs are entirely configured for sprinting speed and cannot sustain a fast pace of long distance travel.
