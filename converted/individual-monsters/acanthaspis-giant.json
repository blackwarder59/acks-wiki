  "markdown": "### Acanthaspis, Giant\n\nThe giant acanthaspis, also known as the giant assassin bug, is a horrific predator with a taste for fresh meat. When full grown, it measures about 10' long and weighs about 800 lbs, with six legs and a short segmented beak. The beak injects acidic enzymes into the bug’s victims, digesting them from the inside so their liquified innards can be sucked out like milk.\n\n###### Combat\n\nAfter killing a victim, the acanthaspis secures the corpse on its glossy black carapace with sticky secretions, wearing its victims as **corpse** **armor.** When first encountered, an acanthaspis will have secured 2d10 corpses to itself. Each corpse can absorb 1hp of damage before being destroyed. It takes 1 turn for an acanthaspis to secure a new corpse to itself.\n\nWhen an acanthaspis successfully bites a creature, the creature struck must make a Paralysis saving throw. If the save succeeds, the attack deals 3d6 {P!} damage but has no other effect. If the save fails, the attack deals 3d6 {P!} damage and the creature is **grabbed**. The acanthaspis immediately injects the grabbed creature with digestive enzymes that deal 1d4 {A!} damage. While the creature remains grabbed, the acanthaspis can use its combat action to automatically deal another 1d4 {A!} damage to the creature each round. Once the acidic damage reduces the grabbed creature to 0 or fewer hp, the acanthaspis immediately sucks out its melted innards, killing it instantly.\n\nIf desperate or frustrated, an acanthaspis can spew a 30’ x 5’ line of **acidic spit**. Any creature in the area of effect must make a Blast saving throw. If the save fails, the creature takes 4d8 {A!} damage. If the save succeeds, it takes half that damage. One such attack depletes the acanthaspis’s acid supply for 6 hours, so it will only spit acid when reduced to fewer than half its hit points or when it has failed to grab an opponent.\n\n###### Ecology\n\nWhen acanthaspis are encountered in a wilderness nest, there is a 25% chance per creature that it will have 1d4 eggs buried nearby. Acanthaspis eggs have 1 hp and weigh 4/6 st. Acanthaspis nymphs are rarely found in nests, because the nymphs immediately disperse into the wild after they emerge from their eggs.\n\n###### Spoils\n\nA slain acanthaspis can be harvested with Animal Husbandry 2 for the following components useful in magic research:\n\n* acid gland (4 2/6 st, 260gp, *rain of vitriol, vitriolic infusion*)\n* antennae (2 st, 120gp, *locate animal/plant, locate object*)\n* mandible (2 st, 120gp, *choking grip, halt humanoid*)\n\nIf not used for magic research, an acanthaspis’s mandibles fetch 18gp and weigh 2/6 st. Its armored hide fetches 80gp and weighs 2 1/6 st.\n\n![](data:image/jpeg;base64...)\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Giant Acanthaspis Primary Characteristics** | |\n| **Type:** | Vermin |\n| **Size:** | Large (80 st.) |\n| **Speed (land):** | 40’ / 120’ |\n| **Speed (burrow):** | 20’ / 60’ |\n| **Armor Class:** | 8 |\n| **Hit Dice:** | 5\\*\\* |\n| **Attacks:** | 1 (bite 6+) |\n| **Damage:** | 3d6 {P!} + grab/acid |\n| **Save:** | F5 |\n| **Morale:** | -1 |\n| **Vision:** | Lightless Vision (60’), Night Vision |\n| **Other Senses:** | Terrestrial Mechanoreception |\n| **Proficiencies:** | None |\n| **Normal Load:** | 72 st. |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Giant Acanthaspis Secondary Characteristics** | |\n| **Expedition Speed:** | 24 miles |\n| **Supply Cost:** | 16gp (carnivorous) |\n| **Training Period:** | 12 months |\n| **Training Modifier:** | -2 |\n| **Battle Rating:** | 0.236 (individual), 14 (unit) |\n| **Lifespan:** | E/0.66/1.25/2.5/3.5/4.66/6.25/8 |\n| **Reproduction:** | 1d4 eggs every 15 months |\n| **Untrained Value:** | 525gp (A)/2,000gp (J) /1,675gp (E) |\n| **Trained Value:** | 4,235gp (hunter) |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Giant Acanthaspis Encounters** | |\n| **Lair:** | 15% |\n| **Dungeon Enc:** | Cluster (1d6) / Nest (1d8) |\n| **Wilderness Enc:** | Cluster (1d6) / Nest (1d8) |\n| **Alignment:** | Neutral |\n| **Treasure Type:** | K |\n| **XP:** | 500 |\n\n",
