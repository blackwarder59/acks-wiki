Even though slowed by zombification, death chargers can manage as much speed as a heavier warhorse and never need food or rest.\n\nLike skeletons and zombies, death chargers have only the dimmest flicker of sapience. Any instructions given to a death charger by its creator or controller must be very simple. In the absence of orders or opponents, death chargers stand still as death.\n\n###### Combat\n\nUnless under another’s control, death chargers are automatically Hostile to any living creature they encounter. They will always charge if possible.\n\nDeath chargers can attack twice with their hooves and once with their melee weapon. They are generally equipped with shield, sword, and lance (with which they deal double damage on a charge). Some death chargers might be further protected by armor.
