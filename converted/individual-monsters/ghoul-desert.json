  "markdown": "### Ghoul, Desert\n\nThese cannibalistic monstrosities are common to the deserts of Aurëpos. In their natural form, they appear as bestial, crouched humanoids with hyena-like features. More often, however, they appear in the form of those they have devoured.\n\nDesert ghouls delight in feasting on the innocent, and enjoy masquerading as children and old women right up until the moment they attack. If unable to feed, desert ghouls begin to rot like the corpses they are.\n\n###### Combat\n\nBy expending a movement action, a desert ghoul can take on the form of the last humanoid creature it has eaten. When transformed, the desert ghoul gains the exact physical qualities (including height, weight, gender, hair color, hair texture, skin color, voice, and facial features) of the new form, but not any mental characteristics, special abilities, or equipment. The desert ghoul can transform back into its natural form instantly at the start of its initiative without expending an action.\n\nDesert ghouls’ transformations are **horrific** to witness. When a desert ghoul transforms, each creature that beholds it must make a Paralysis saving throw. If the save fails, the creature is **cowering** until the end of its next initiative and thereafter gains immunity to the effects of every ghoul’s horrific transformation for 1 turn. If the save succeeds, the creature is not affected and immediately gains immunity to the effects of every ghoul’s horrific transformation for 1 turn.\n\nLike other ghouls, desert ghouls attack with claws and bite. Any humanoid creature that suffers the loss of 50% or more of its total hp fighting desert ghouls is infected with **ghoul fever** and will become a desert ghoul in 2d6 days. This transformation can be prevented with the divine spell *cure disease* if cast before the disease has taken full hold.\n\nAs undead, desert ghouls are immune to enchantment effects, necrotic damage, and poisonous damage. They are inherently evil for purposes of *discern evil*and *holy circle*spells. They are rebuked as ghouls.\n\n###### Ecology\n\nBecause they can pose as ordinary men and women, desert ghouls can thrive in populated villages, towns, and cities.\n\n###### Spoils\n\nA destroyed desert ghoul can be harvested Healing 2 for the following components useful in magic research:\n\n* claws (4/6 st., 40gp, *cause disease*)\n* skin (4/6 st., 40gp, *adjust self, inspire horror*)\n\n###### Lore\n\n*Mahmoud’s fifth wife, Aliya, was as beautiful as a goddess, yet as cruel as a demoness.
