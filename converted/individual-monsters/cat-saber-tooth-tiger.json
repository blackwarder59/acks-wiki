  "markdown": "### Cat, Saber-Tooth Tiger\n\nSaber-tooth tigers are an ancient species that the most learned sages agree to be long extinct in Aurëpos. However, adventurers have reported encountering these prehistoric predators in the high mountains of Aurëpos, the untamed jungles of Ulruk and certain uncharted and remote tropical islands.\n\n###### Combat\n\nSaber-toothed tigers have **acute hearing** and **acute olfaction.** They gain a +2 bonus to avoid surprise in their natural habitat. They can track the scent of creatures for up to 4 miles with the equivalent of two ranks of Tracking proficiency.\n\nThey are **quite agile** (as Acrobatics proficiency at 12+) and **good climbers**, able to ascend sheer surfaces as if they were thieves (6+). They are also **adept at swimming** (as Swimming proficiency). Their **lightning reflexes** grant a +1 bonus to initiative. They are **naturally stealthy** when in their native habitat, and creatures encountering them suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls.\n\nIf a tiger charges a creature or leaps over it (using Acrobatics), and successfully hits it with both claws, it immediately **pounces** onthe creature. The tiger’s subsequent bite attack automatically hits and the creature that has been pounced on must make a successful size-adjusted Paralysis saving throw or be knocked **prone**.\n\n###### Ecology\n\nWhen saber-tooth tigers are encountered in a wilderness den, the saber-tooths will be rearing 1d2 juvenile saber-tooths and 1d4 baby saber-tooths. Juvenile saber-tooths have AC 1, Spd 120’, HD 4, and attack with 2 claws (1d3 {S}) and a bite (1d8 {P}). Baby saber-tooths have AC 0, Spd 120’, HD 2+2, and attack with 2 scratches (1 {S}) and a bite (1d3 {P}).\n\n###### Spoils\n\nA slain saber-tooth tiger can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following components useful in magic research:\n\n* heart (9 1/6 st, 550gp, *silent step, swift sword,* weapon +1)\n* tongue (9 1/6 st, 550gp, *call of the great cats*)\n\nA saber-tooth tiger's pelt fetches 115gp weighs 2 1/6 st.\n\n###### Encounter\n\nA freshwater stream trickling through a narrow gulch flows into a talus cavern, 8’ high, 7’ wide, and some 40’ long, created by a rock fall some years ago. Creatures attempting to water at the stream, or enter the cave, are attacked by a troop of **three sabre-tooth tigers** who are rearing a **pair of juvenile sabre-tooth cubs**. The **troop leader**, ferocious even by the standards of prehistoric great cats, is ranging on the highlands above the gulch and will arrive 1d6 rounds after the den is attacked.\n\nSabre-tooth troop leader: Str 14, Dex 18; AC 6, Spd 180', HD 8, hp 43, #AT 3 (2 claws 2+/bite 1+), Dmg 1d8+1 {S} / 1d8+1 {S} / 2d8+2 {P}, Save F4, ML +2, XP 1100; Special: lightning reflexes, naturally stealthy, pounce\n\n![](data:image/png;base64...)\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Saber-tooth Tiger Primary Characteristics** | |\n| **Type:** | Animal (prehistoric) |\n| **Size:** | Large (80 st.) |\n| **Speed (land):** | 50’ / 150’ |\n| **Armor Class:** | 3 |\n| **Hit Dice:** | 8\\* |\n| **Attacks:** | 3 (2 claws, 1 bite 3+) |\n| **Damage:** | 1d8 {S} /1d8 {S} /2d8 {P} |\n| **Save:** | F4 |\n| **Morale:** | +2 |\n| **Vision:** | Night Vision |\n| **Other Senses:** | Acute Hearing, Acute Olfaction |\n| **Proficiencies:** | Acrobatics 12+, Climbing 5+,  Listen. 14+, Swimming, Tracking 7+ |\n| **Normal Load:** | 48 st. |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Saber-tooth Tiger Secondary Characteristics** | |\n| **Expedition Speed:** | 30 miles |\n| **Supply Cost:** | 16gp |\n| **Training Period:** | 6 months |\n| **Training Modifier:** | +1 |\n| **Battle Rating:** | 0.268 (individual), 16 (unit) |\n| **Lifespan:** | 0/2.5/5/7.5/14/21/28/35 |\n| **Reproduction:** | 1d3 cubs every 2 years |\n| **Untrained Value:** | 3,000gp (A)/2,365gp (J) /1,000gp (B) |\n| **Trained Value:** | 6,365gp (war mount)  6,000gp (hunter) |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Saber-tooth Tiger Encounter Set-Up** | |\n| **Lair:** | 10% |\n| **Dungeon Enc:** | Troop (1d4+1) / Den (1d4+1) |\n| **Wilderness Enc:** | Troop (1d4+1) / Den (1d4+1) |\n| **Alignment:** | Neutral |\n| **Treasure Type:** | None |\n| **XP:** | 1100 |\n\n**Sabre-tooth tigers (3):**Spd 150’, AC 3, HD 8, hp 40, 36, 32, #AT 3 (2 claws/bite 3+), Dmg 1d8 {S} /1d8 {S} /2d8 {P}, Save F4, ML +2, XP 1100\n\n**Juvenile sabre-tooths (2):** Spd 120’, AC 1, HD 4, hp 21, 18, #AT 3 (2 claws/bite 7+), Dmg 1d3 {S} /1d3 {S} /1d8 {P}, Save F2, ML +2, XP 80\n\n",
