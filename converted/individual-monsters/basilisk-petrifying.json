  "markdown": "### Basilisk, Petrifying\n\nThe petrifying basilisk was created by crossbreeding a primordial basilisk with a gorgon. Like its progenitor, it resembles a reptilian monster with a dun-colored body and mustard-hued underbelly with a length of 10’ and weight of 300 lbs. However, petrifying basilisks lack the horn characteristic of their primordial kin.\n\n###### Combat\n\nPetrifying basilisks have tough hides that are **resistant** to mundane bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.\n\nThe bite of a petrifying basilisk can turn a creature to stone. Any creature that is bitten must make a Paralysis saving throw. If the save succeeds, the creature is unaffected. If the save fails, the creature is instantaneously **petrified**.\n\nIn lieu of biting, a petrifying basilisk can direct its **petrifying gaze** in in a cone 60' long and 30' wide in front of itself. Each creature within the cone that is beholding the basilisk must make a Paralysis saving throw. If the save succeeds, the creature is not affected. If the save fails, the creature is instantly **petrified**.\n\n###### Ecology\n\nPetrifying basilisks often live in dense woods or dungeons. When petrifying basilisks are encountered in their nest there is a 10% chance per basilisk that it will be incubating 1d3 eggs. Basilisk eggs have 1 hp and weigh 2/6 st. Basilisk hatchlings are rarely found in nests, because the hatchlings immediately disperse into the wild after they emerge from their eggs.\n\n###### Spoils\n\nAny treasure in a petrifying basilisk’s nest will be on petrified victims, and will only be accessible if the victims are restored to flesh.\n\nA slain petrifying basilisk can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the following components useful in magic research:\n\n* eyes (8 2/6 st., 500gp, *blinding flash, cone of paralysis, hypnotic sigil, petrification*)\n* gizzard (8 2/6 st., 500gp, *depetrification, earth’s mire*)\n* Basilisks are difficult to train, but their powerful abilities allow them to command a premium.\n\n###### Lore\n\n*There are two species of basilisk in Aurëpos: the horned basilisk and the smoothskull basilisk. Of the dangers of the horned basilisk, whose noxious miasma slays any who inhale it, I have already written. But the dangers posed by the smoothskull basilisk are actually far greater, for the very sight of the creature can turn a man to stone. An encounter with such a basilisk cost us seven members of our expedition, among them my beloved Optëlitas. Had I but looked at the basilisk’s skull, I could have warned them, and she would still be flesh... but then I would have been stone.*\n\n* Toraster the Elder, *Bestiary of Aurëpos*\n\n![](data:image/png;base64...)\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Petrifying Basilisk Primary Characteristics** | |\n| **Type:** | Monstrosity (bestial) |\n| **Size:** | Man-sized (30 st.) |\n| **Speed (land):** | 20’ / 60’ |\n| **Armor Class:** | 5 |\n| **Hit Dice:** | 6 + 1 \\*\\* |\n| **Attacks:** | 1 (bite 4+ or gaze) |\n| **Damage:** | 1d10 {P!} + petrify or petrify |\n| **Save:** | F6 |\n| **Morale:** | +1 |\n| **Vision:** | Lightless Vision (60’), Night Vision |\n| **Other Senses:** | Standard |\n| **Proficiencies:** | None |\n| **Normal Load:** | 20 st. |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Petrifying Basilisk Secondary Characteristics** | |\n| **Expedition Speed:** | 12 miles |\n| **Supply Cost:** | 2gp |\n| **Training Period:** | 6 months |\n| **Training Modifier:** | 0 |\n| **Battle Rating:** | 0.941 (individual), 133 (unit) |\n| **Lifespan:** | E/1.25/5/8.5/20/30/40/50 |\n| **Reproduction:** | 1d3 eggs every 6 years |\n| **Untrained Value:** | 14,250gp (A) / 6,125gp (J) /4,125gp (E) |\n| **Trained Value:** | 21,000gp (Hunter) |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Petrifying Basilisk Encounter Set-Up** | |\n| **Lair:** | 40% |\n| **Dungeon Enc:** | Bask (1d6) / Nest (1d6) |\n| **Wilderness Enc:** | Bask (1d6) / Nest (1d6) |\n| **Alignment:** | Neutral |\n| **Treasure Type:** | P |\n| **XP:** | 980 |\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |\n\n",
