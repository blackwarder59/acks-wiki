  "markdown": "### Faerie, Redcap\n\nThe most vile and vicious of the fae, redcaps are sinewy old men with sharp, elongated teeth, filthy clawed fingers, and staring red eyes. They wear tarnished mail on their bodies, rusty iron boots on their feet, and woolen caps on their heads, stained red with the blood of those they kill, and carry jagged iron spears.\n\nRedcaps live a solitary life, actively hunting such lone or weak-looking wanderers or beasts as venture too close. When a victim is slain, the redcap dips its cap in the blood before settling down to feast.\n\nLike other faeries, redcaps are found primarily in northern Aurëpos, particularly in Northern Argollë, Jutland, and Rorn. Though some dwell in Southern Argollë, they are otherwise very rare in the south, where nymphs rather than faeries are found.\n\nRedcaps speak the lilting language of faeries and the languages spoken by the local gnoll, hobgoblin, and orc tribes.\n\n###### Combat\n\nRedcaps are **preternaturally fast**. They gain a +2 bonus to initiative rolls and have a combat speed of 120’ per round. As proficient **skirmishers**, they do not suffer an AC penalty when charging or running and can withdraw or retreat from melee combat without declaring the intention to do so at the start of the melee round.\n\nRedcaps prefer to hunt their targets with spears, with which they gain a +1 damage bonus. They can resort to tooth and claw if the spear is broken or if they are feeling particularly bloodthirsty.\n\nMany a would-be hero has found to their ultimate cost that redcaps are quite hard to kill. Redcaps are **immune** to all mundane damage. However, if the blood staining a redcap’s hat every fully dries (which takes 24 hours), the redcap is irrevocably slain.\n\n###### Ecology\n\nRedcaps dwell in abandoned hill forts and other ruins that littler Jutland and Ron. Like brownies and knockers, redcaps do not have women or children of any sort. They reproduce by transforming particularly vicious or ugly gnoll, hobgoblin, or orc whelps into their own kind in magic rituals performed in places of power on unholy days. The newborn redcaps remember their old life dimly as if a dream, which fades with time.\n\nRedcaps do not have to work hard to find victims, because beastmen shamans will regularly offer up whelps from the tribe to them in exchange for alliance and aid.\n\n###### Spoils\n\nA slain redcap can be harvested with Healing 1 for the following component:\n\n* bloody scalp (2 2/6 st., 135gp, *physical protection (all), safe travels, swift sword*)\n\n![](data:image/png;base64...)\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Redcap Primary Characteristics** | |\n| **Type:** | Enchanted Humanoid |\n| **Size:** | Man-sized (15 st.) |\n| **Speed:** | 120’ / 360’ |\n| **Armor Class:** | 5 |\n| **Hit Dice:** | 4\\* |\n| **Attacks:** | 1 (spear 7+) or 3 (claws, bite 7+) |\n| **Damage:** | 1d8+1 {P!} or  1d3 {S!} / 1d3 {S!} / 1d4 {P!} |\n| **Save:** | E4 |\n| **Morale:** | +2 |\n| **Vision:** | Lightless Vision (60’) |\n| **Other Senses:** | Standard |\n| **Proficiencies:** | Skirmishing |\n| **Normal Load:** | 20 st. |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Redcap Secondary Characteristics** | |\n| **Expedition Speed:** | 72 miles |\n| **Supply Cost:** | 2gp (carnivorous) |\n| **Training Period:** | 1 month (sapient) |\n| **Training Modifier:** | None (sapient) |\n| **Battle Rating:** | 0.424 (individual), 51 (unit) |\n| **Lifespan:** | 0/4/15/51/-/-/-/200 |\n| **Reproduction:** | Special |\n| **Untrained Value:** | 200gp (A)/260gp (J) / 75gp (A) |\n| **Trained Value:** | 10,000gp |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Redcap Encounter Set-Up** | |\n| **Lair:** | 40% |\n| **Dungeon Enc:** | Solitary (1) / Lair (1) |\n| **Wilderness Enc:** | Solitary (1) / Lair (1) |\n| **Alignment:** | Chaotic |\n| **Treasure Type:** | B |\n| **XP:** | 135 |\n\n",
