  "markdown": "### Equine, Light Horse\n\nLight horses are built for speed and long-distance travel. Domesticated light horses are found throughout Aurëpos, where they are used for riding or war. Wild light horses can be found in Opelenea, Shebatea, and Somirea.\n\n###### Combat\n\nMost light horses are easily frightened (-2 Morale). Some light horses, however, can overcome their skittishness through **training for war**. War-trained light horses gain +2 to morale and (if a horse) one extra hoof attack. The rider of a war-trained light horse can attack with a charge, dealing double damage with a lance, and a war-trained light horse can attack with its hooves during the charge as well.\n\n###### Ecology\n\nWhen a light horse herd is encountered, there is a 50% chance they will be a matriarchal herd with 1d6 juvenile horses and 1d2 baby horses. (Otherwise, it’s a bachelor herd.) Juveniles have AC 0, Spd 180’, HD 1/2, and attack with 1 hoof (1d2 {B}). Babies have AC -1, Spd 180’, 1 hit point, ML -4, and do not fight.\n\nLight horses are bred for strength, speed, and stamina, and finely-bred specimens often have exceptional attributes (see “Attributes for Monsters,” on p. XXX). Light horses with DEX 13+ have their encounter movement rate adjusted by 20’ x DEX bonus. Their combat speed is adjusted by one-third the encounter speed adjustment. Their ability to travel long distances quickly is limited by their stamina as well as speed, so light horses have their expedition speed adjusted by the lower of DEX or CON bonus x 4 miles. Equines with STR 13+ have their maximum load adjusted by their STR bonus x 2.\n\n###### Spoils\n\nA slain horse with exceptional attributes can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following component:\n\n* hooves (2/6 st., 20gp, *call of the galloping herd, safe travels, swift sword*)\n\n###### Lore\n\n*Of the light or hot-blooded horse breeds, the Opelenean is the most renowned.
