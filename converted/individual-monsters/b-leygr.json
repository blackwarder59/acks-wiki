Báleygr rejoice in war and bloodshed, and typically carry giant-sized weapons of black metal in each hand, favoring a sword, axe, or mace in one hand and a whip in the other.\n\nSome sages believe that the báleygr were once guardians of the Elemental Sphere of Fire, and that they were turned to darkness by Bel, called the Slaughterprince, the Chthonic god of battle. Others claim they are born of the hates and fears of men, and grow stronger as the world descends into chaos. Whatever their origins, báleygr are fearsome foes who bring ruin to any that stand against them.\n\nBáleygr are as intelligent as they are evil. All báleygr can speak Common and two other languages, often Ancient Zaharan and the local beastman dialect.\n\n###### Combat\n\nAt will, a báleygr can surround itself with an **aura of elemental fire** and/or **shrouding smoke**. When the báleygr’s aura of elemental fire is active, creatures within 15’ of the báleygr take 1d8 {F!} damage if they begin their initiative in its aura, or move into it on their initiative. When its aura of shrouding smoke is active, the báleygr is hidden by the smoke and any creatures (other than the báleygr) within 25’ of it are **blinded** unless able to discern invisible. The báleygr can have both auras active, if desired.\n\nA báleygr is **dreadful** to confront.A creature which starts its initiative, or moves within, 60’ of a báleygr must make a Paralysis saving throw. If the save succeeds, the creature gains immunity to the effects of every báleygr’s dreadfulness for 1 turn. If the save fails, the creature starts **faltering.** If the creature was already faltering, it becomes **frightened** instead. The faltering or frightened condition ends if removed magically or if the báleygr is destroyed or no longer within 60’. As a báleygr’s dreadful presence is preternatural, it functions even through the obscurement of its aura of shrouding smoke.\n\nIn melee, a báleygr will strike with one of its giant-sized weapons. Targets within 10’ can be attacked with its sword, axe, or mace for 4d6 {W!} damage. More distant targets, up to 30’, can be attacked with its whip for 2d6 {S!} damage. Targets struck by the báleygr’s whip must make successful size-adjusted Paralysis throws or be dragged adjacent to the báleygr.\n\nOccasionally báleygr arm themselves with huge bows, with which they shoot flaming arrows. Báleygr’s bows have twice the range of longbows and deal 4d6 {P!} {F!} damage on a successful attack. A báleygr can cleave with its bow without restriction from the weapon. All of a báleygr’s weapons melt into slag if the creature is slain.\n\nA báleygr has the spellcasting abilities of a 9th level mage with the following spells in its repertoire: 1st - *blinding flash, counterspell, kindle flame, weave smoke, tenebrosity*; 2nd – *battering ram, burning sparks, circling winds, discern invisible, shrouding fog*; 3rd – *boil blood, fireball, thunderbolt, weave fire*; 4th – *inferno, scouring zephyr, wall of flame*; 5th – *carnage, fire storm*.\n\nA báleygr is **immune** to death effects and to fire, necrotic, and poisonous damage. It is **resistant** to acidic, bludgeoning, cold, electricity, piercing, seismic, and slashing damage. It possesses **lightless vision** (90’) and **telepathy**, which allows it to communicate with any creatures it encounters. It can be held at bay by *holy circle*and rebuked by a divine caster as an infernal creature. If rebuked, however, it can make a Spells saving throw; if the save succeeds, the báleygr can ignore the effect and cannot be rebuked by that divine caster again.\n\nBáleygr are unholy beings that can be detected with *discern evil*, held at bay by *holy circle* and destroyed with *dispel evil.* If summoned, they can be returned to their home spheres by *counterspell* or *dispel magic*.\n\n###### Ecology\n\nBáleygr dwell in the bowels of the earth, in furnaces of elemental fire or sinkholes of evil. From time to time, dwarven engineers who delve too deep come upon these terrible creatures of smoke and flame.\n\nIf encountered in a wilderness lair, a legion of báleygr will be led by a **báleygr lord**. The lord has a 25% chance to be mounted on a winged drake-form red dragon of mature adult age.\n\n###### Spoils\n\nA destroyed báleygr can be harvested with Alchemy 2 for the following components useful in magic research:\n\n* black ashy remains (95 st, 5700gp, *cone of fear, inspire horror, panic, shrouding fog,* all fire elemental effects)\n\nThe black ashy remains of báleygr lords are even more valuable (141 4/6 st, 8500gp).\n\n###### Lore\n\n*When the war-drum was struck the twelfth time, the báleygr came forth. Smoke shrouded it, hot as forge-fire. Dreadful was its presence, and many men, once accounted among brave, faltered and fled at its approach.*\n\n*But Valerian Bellësareus was not afraid. The Lord of the Empyrean Host stepped into the smoky furnace, calling out to his warriors. “Be not afraid of the terror of darkness, for Ammonar shall illumine the way!” And his sword of fire held aloft was like a beacon-fire that guides ships to port in dark fog.*\n\n* Azendor, *Seven Radiant Scrolls,* Fourth Book of the Empyrean War\n\n#### Báleygr (Cont.)\n\n![](data:image/png;base64...)\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Báleygr Primary Characteristics** | |\n| **Type:** | Incarnation (demon) |\n| **Size:** | Huge (700 st.) |\n| **Speed (land):** | 40’ / 120’ |\n| **Armor Class:** | 10 |\n| **Hit Dice:** | 12\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* |\n| **Attacks:** | 1 (weapon or whip -1+) |\n| **Damage:** | 4d6 {W!} /2d6 {S! + drag |\n| **Save:** | F12 |\n| **Morale:** | +4 |\n| **Vision:** | Lightless Vision (90’) |\n| **Other Senses:** | Standard |\n| **Proficiencies:** | None |\n| **Normal Load:** | 90 st. |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Báleygr Secondary Characteristics** | |\n| **Expedition Speed:** | 24 miles |\n| **Supply Cost:** | None |\n| **Training Period:** | 1 month (sapient) |\n| **Training Modifier:** | None (sapient) |\n| **Battle Rating:** | 9.5 (individual), 185 (unit) |\n| **Lifespan:** | Indefinite |\n| **Reproduction:** | None |\n| **Untrained Value:** | 5,700gp (A) / - / - |\n| **Trained Value:** | 220,000gp (sapient) |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Báleygr Encounter Set-Up** | |\n| **Lair:** | 10% |\n| **Dungeon Enc:** | Solitary (1) / Fist (1d4) |\n| **Wilderness Enc:** | Fist (1d4) / Legion (2d4 Fists) |\n| **Alignment:** | Chaotic |\n| **Treasure Type:** | Q (per báleygr) |\n| **XP:** | 5,700 |\n\n![](data:image/png;base64...)\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Báleygr Lord Primary Characteristics** | |\n| **Type:** | Incarnation (demon) |\n| **Size:** | Huge (700 st.) |\n| **Speed (land):** | 40’ / 120’ |\n| **Armor Class:** | 12 |\n| **Hit Dice:** | 16\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* |\n| **Attacks:** | 1 (weapon or whip -5+) |\n| **Damage:** | 5d6 {W!} /3d6 {S!} + drag |\n| **Save:** | F16 |\n| **Morale:** | +4 |\n| **Vision:** | Lightless Vision (90’) |\n| **Other Senses:** | Standard |\n| **Proficiencies:** | None |\n| **Normal Load:** | 90 st. |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Báleygr Lord Secondary Characteristics** | |\n| **Expedition Speed:** | 24 miles |\n| **Supply Cost:** | None |\n| **Training Period:** | 1 month (sapient) |\n| **Training Modifier:** | None (sapient) |\n| **Battle Rating:** | 12 (individual), 245 (unit) |\n| **Lifespan:** | Indefinite |\n| **Reproduction:** | None |\n| **Untrained Value:** | 8,500gp (A) / - / - |\n| **Trained Value:** | 290,000gp (sapient) |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Báleygr Lord Encounter Set-Up** | |\n| **Lair:** | Special |\n| **Dungeon Enc:** | Special |\n| **Wilderness Enc:** | Special |\n| **Alignment:** | Neutral |\n| **Treasure Type:** | N, Q (per lord) |\n| **XP:** | 8,500 |\n\n",
