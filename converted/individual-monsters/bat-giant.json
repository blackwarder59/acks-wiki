  "markdown": "### Bat, Giant\n\nGiant bats were bred from vampiric stock to be large fierce flying carnivores. A full-grown adult has a 17’ wingspan and weighs around 75 lbs.\n\nGiant bats prefer to nest in the same environments as their ordinary cousins, such as dark forests, lightless caverns, and abandoned towers and attics. Because of their much greater size, they do not form swarms, although they occasionally can gather in groups as large as 30.\n\n###### Combat\n\nLike ordinary bats, giant bats navigate and hunt with **echolocation** (540’ range). No spells or effects that would ordinarily blind a creature will affect a bat, but *inaudible* creatures are hidden from them, and *noiselessness* blinds them.\n\n###### Ecology\n\nWhenever giant bats are encountered, each giant bat has a 15% chance of carrying a bat pup. Roll 1d4 for age: 1 it’s a baby bats, 2-4 it’s a juvenile bat. Juvenile giant bats have AC 1, Spd 30’, HD 1, and 1 bite (1d4). Baby giant bats have AC 0, Spd 15’, HD 1/2, ML -4, and do not fight.\n\n###### Spoils\n\nA slain giant bat can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following component:\n\n* ears (3/6 st, 29gp*, inaudibility, noiselessness*)\n\n###### Encounter\n\nAncient stone steps lead down into a small depression in the earth here, some 240’ diameter. At the foot of the steps, a granite stone slab covers an entrance that leads into the side of the depression. The stone slab is heavily weathered and very old, and sits partly open. (Fully opening or closing the heavy stone door requires a proficiency throw to open doors at -4.) Beyond the stone slab door is a catacomb gallery, 7’ high, 8’ wide, and 30’ long, with thirty wall graves piercing the walls.\n\nThe graves were long ago robbed and hold only worthless trinkets, while the skeletons crumble to dust if touched. Now the catacomb is the lair of **eight giant bats**. The bats leave at dusk each night to hunt, returning at dawn, so adventurers who reach the lair during evening hours may think it is unoccupied. The bats have no treasure.
