In their human form, they often have large noses, strong jaws, and wolfish grins with large canines.\n\nThe Chthonic god Nargund, the Beast Lord, created the first werewolves, which were also the very first lycanthropes. As the progenitors of lycanthropy, werewolves are dominated by their animal nature more than other lycanthropes.\n\n###### Combat\n\nIn beast form, werewolves have **acute hearing** and **acute olfaction.** They gain a +2 bonus to avoid surprise in their natural habitat. They can track the scent of creatures for up to 4 miles with the equivalent of two ranks of Tracking.\n\nDue to their powerful jaws, werewolves have **bone-breaking bites**. If the werewolf succeeds on an attack throw with an unmodified 20 , the creature bitten must make a Death saving throw. If the save succeeds, the creature suffers double the ordinary damage dice (4d4 {P!}). If the save fails, the creature suffers triple the ordinary damage (6d4 {P!}) and has a limb broken. Roll 1d6 to determine which limb is broken: 1-2 weapon hand, 3 weapon arm, 4-5 near leg, 6 far leg. A broken limb has the same game effect as a missing limb (***ACKS II RR***Permanent wounds tables, p. XX – XX) until it heals. A broken wound heals after 180 days, or 90 days under treatment of a healer.\n\n###### Ecology\n\nWerewolves organize themselves into packs led by the strongest and fiercest.
