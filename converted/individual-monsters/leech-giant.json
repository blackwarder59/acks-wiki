  "markdown": "### Leech, Giant\n\nGiant leeches are parasitic segmented worms measuring 4' long and weighing as much as 215 lbs. Brown, slimy, and repulsive, they live exclusively in marshy terrain and other bodies of stagnant water. Giant leeches are nearly mindless and exist only to feed and reproduce. A full-grown leech can suck a man dry of blood within less than a minute.\n\n###### Combat\n\nSmall hair-like sensilla distributed across a giant leech’s body grant it **aquatic mechanoreception**. The leech can sense changes in water current and water pressure to a range of 60’. Spells or effects that would ordinarily cause *blindness* do not affect a monster using aquatic mechanoreception. However, creatures that are not in the water are invisible to them. Aquatic mechanoreception does not penetrate structures or terrain features.\n\nWhen a giant leech senses a living creature in range, it attacks with its proboscis for 3d6 {P!} damage. If the leech damages the target with its proboscis, the leech latches onto the target and begins **drinking blood**. Once latched on, the leach can use its combat action to automatically deal another 3d6 {N!} damage to the creature each round.\n\nCreatures that are having their blood drunk by a leech can still move, but count as carrying an extra 21 stone of encumbrance. The giant leech moves with the creature it is latched onto. A giant leech will remain attached to a target until the target dies or the leach is killed.\n\n###### Ecology\n\nGiant leeches are hermaphroditic and can either self-fertilize or engage in reciprocal fertilization with another giant leech. In either case, the giant leech will wrap its eggs in a cocoon, which they carry on their bodies until the eggs hatch.\n\nWhen giant leeches are encountered, there is a 20% chance per leech that it will be carrying a cocoon of 1d4 eggs. The eggs have 1 hp and weight 1/60 st. Leech larvae immediately disperse into the wild after they emerge from their eggs.\n\n###### Spoils\n\nA slain giant leech can be harvested with Animal Husbandry 2 for the following components useful in magic research:\n\n* sucker (6 4/6 st, 400gp, *cause injury, life transfer*)\n* salivary gland (4 3/6 st, 270gp, *cure injury, salving rest*)\n\n![](data:image/png;base64...)\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Giant Leech Primary Characteristics** | |\n| **Type:** | Vermin |\n| **Size:** | Man-sized (21 st.) |\n| **Speed (land):** | 40’ / 120’ |\n| **Speed (swimming):** | 40’ / 120’ |\n| **Armor Class:** | 2 |\n| **Hit Dice:** | 6\\* |\n| **Attacks:** | 1 (proboscis 5+) |\n| **Damage:** | 3d6 {P!} + blood drain |\n| **Save:** | F3 |\n| **Morale:** | +2 |\n| **Vision:** | Lightless Vision Only (60’) |\n| **Other Senses:** | Aquatic Mechanoreception (60’) |\n| **Proficiencies:** | None |\n| **Normal Load:** | 4 st. |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Giant Leech Secondary Characteristics** | |\n| **Expedition Speed:** | 24 miles (land or water) |\n| **Supply Cost:** | 2gp (carnivorous) |\n| **Training Period:** | 12 months |\n| **Training Modifier:** | -3 |\n| **Battle Rating:** | 0.095 (individual), 11.5 (unit) |\n| **Lifespan:** | E/1/2/4/10/15/20/25 |\n| **Reproduction:** | 1d4 eggs every 5 years |\n| **Untrained Value:** | 575gp (A) / 400gp (J) / 290gp |\n| **Trained Value:** | 875gp (hunter) |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Giant Leech Encounter Set-Up** | |\n| **Lair:** | None |\n| **Dungeon Enc:** | None |\n| **Wilderness Enc:** | Brood (1d4) |\n| **Alignment:** | Neutral |\n| **Treasure Type:** | K |\n| **XP:** | 570 |\n\n",
