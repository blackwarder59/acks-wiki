They can be found in the rivers, lakes, and coastal waters of Aurëpos and Danea. They typically are born in freshwater, migrate to the ocean to grow, and return to freshwater to spawn.\n\n###### Combat\n\nGiant sturgeons possess long whisker-like sensory organs called barbels that give them the best **aquatic mechanoreception** of any giant fish. They can “see” in water up to 600’ by sensing changes in water current and water pressure. Spells or effects that would ordinarily cause blindness do not affect the sturgeon while it is using aquatic mechanoreception. However, creatures that are not in the water are invisible to them. Aquatic mechanoreception does not penetrate structures or terrain features.\n\nIf a giant sturgeon succeeds on a bite attack against a creature of large size or less with an unmodified throw of 19 - 20, it can **swallow** the creature. The swallowed creature suffers 2d6 acidic damage at the start of its initiative each round and drowns after 10 rounds. Each time it suffers acidic damage, the swallowed creature must make a Paralysis saving throw. If the save fails, the creature is **paralyzed** for 2d4 turns. If the swallowed creature has a tiny, small, or natural piercing or slashing weapon, it can attack the sturgeon from inside its belly with a -4 penalty. Should a swallowed creature die and remain in the sturgeon’s belly for 6 turns, it is irrecoverably digested. The sturgeon can cleave after swallowing a creature.\n\n###### Ecology\n\nGiant sturgeon do not establish nests or exhibit any parental care for their offspring. They rely on broadcast spawning, in which the female deposits her eggs widely onto the various rocks, gravel, and vegetation found on the riverbed, and the male externally fertilizes them.\n\n###### Spoils\n\nBecause of their propensity to swallow creatures whole, any encounter with giant sturgeons can yield treasure, whether wandering or in lair.
