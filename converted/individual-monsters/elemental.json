The elements on these spheres are alive, permeated with the divine spark of the Cosmarch; but it is a collective, subsumed into the ubiquity of the element, all dwelling in union with all. Conjuration and summoning spells, however, can tear a fragment of the living element away from its collective, instantiating it as an individual creature, an **elemental**, on the Celestial Sphere.\n\nWhatever their element, all elementals are **immune** to enchantment effects, necrotic damage, poisonous damage, and mundane bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. They all have **lightless vision** (ranges varies by element), with other senses afforded by their element. If they possess aerial or aquatic mechanoreception, it is effective to a range equal to their movement. As incarnations, elementals can be held at bay by *holy circle* anddispelled with *counterspell* or *dispel magic*.\n\nBecause they are instantiated by the spells that conjure them, elementals understand the languages of their summoner.\n\n###### Elemental Characteristics by Tier\n\nElementals come in four **tiers** of power: petty, minor, major, and supreme. Many of an elemental’s characteristics depend primarily on its tier.\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Elemental Characteristics by Tier | | | | | | |\n| Rank | Size | AC | HD | Damage | Save | XP |\n| Petty | Large | 5 | 4\\* | 1d4 | F4 | 135 |\n| Minor | Huge | 7 | 8\\* | 1d8 | F8 | 1,100 |\n| Major | Gigantic | 9 | 12\\* | 2d8 | F12 | 2,100 |\n| Supreme | Colossal | 11 | 16\\* | 3d8 | F16 | 3,300 |\n\n###### Elemental Characteristics by Element\n\nThe other characteristics of an elemental are determined by its **element**. The Elemental Characteristics by Element tables, on the adjoining page, detail these characteristics. Other notes about the different elements are below.\n\n**Air Elementals:** Air elementals appear as twirling masses of air crackling with lightning. For every HD possessed by an air elemental, it has a diameter of 6” and a height of 2'. For instance, a supreme air elemental with 16 HD would have a diameter of 8’ and a height of 32'.\n\nAir elementals always deal {E!}damage. They inflict double damage dice when they hit targets flying in the air. When an air elemental damages a creature smaller than itself, the creature must make a size-adjusted Paralysis save. If the save fails, the creature is spun off in a random direction to a distance equal to the height of the elemental, landing **prone**. The air elemental can cleave after spinning off a creature.\n\n![](data:image/png;base64...)\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Elemental Primary Characteristics** | |\n| **Type:** | Incarnation (elemental) |\n| **Size:** | Varies by HD |\n| **Speed (land):** | Varies by Element |\n| **Speed (other):** | Varies by Element |\n| **Armor Class:** | Varies by Tier |\n| **Hit Dice:** | Varies by Tier |\n| **Attacks:** | 1 |\n| **Damage:** | Varies by Tier and Element |\n| **Save:** | Varies by Tier |\n| **Morale:** | +4 |\n| **Vision:** | Lightless Vision (varies by element) |\n| **Other Senses:** | Varies by Element |\n| **Proficiencies:** | None |\n| **Normal Load:** | Varies by Size and Element |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Elemental Secondary Characteristics** | |\n| **Expedition Speed:** | Varies by Element |\n| **Supply Cost:** | None |\n| **Training Period:** | 1 month (sapient) |\n| **Training Modifier:** | None (sapient) |\n| **Battle Rating:** | Varies by Tier and Element |\n| **Lifespan:** | Indefinite |\n| **Reproduction:** | None |\n| **Untrained Value:** | None |\n| **Trained Value:** | Varies by Tier |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Elemental Encounter Set-Up** | |\n| **Lair:** | None |\n| **Dungeon Enc:** | Solitary (1) |\n| **Wilderness Enc:** | Solitary (1) |\n| **Alignment:** | Neutral |\n| **Treasure Type:** | None |\n| **XP:** | Varies by Tier |\n\n###### Elemental Characteristics by Element\n\n**Earth Elementals:** Earth elementals appear as giant humanoids made of earth. For every HD possessed by an earth elemental, it will stand 1' tall and 6” wide. For instance, a major earth elemental with 12 HD would be 12’ high and 6’ wide. Earth elementals are unable to move through bodies of water that are wider than the elemental is tall. For example, a 12’ earth elemental can cross a 9’ stream but not a 20’ river.\n\nEarth elementals always deal {Se!} mic damage. They deal double damage dice when they hit targets standing on the ground. When an earth elemental damages a creature smaller than itself, the creature must make a Paralysis save with a -2 penalty per difference in size. If the save fails, the creature is knocked **prone** and flung away from the elemental a distance 1’ per point of damage dealt. The earth elemental can cleave after toppling and flinging a creature.\n\n**Fire Elementals:** Fire elementals appear as giant pillars of flame. For every HD possessed by a fire elemental, it will have a diameter of 1' and a height of 1'. For instance, a minor fire elemental with 8 HD would be have a diameter of 8’ and height of 8’. Fire elementals are unable to move through bodies of water that are wider than the elemental’s diameter.\n\nFire elementals always deal {F!} damage. They deal double damage dice when they hit targets that are **burning** or are carrying candles, lanterns, torches, or other open flames. When a fire elemental damages a creature, the creature must make a Blast saving throw. If the save fails, the creature starts **burning**.Itsuffering 1d8 fire damage at the start of its next initiative. The condition ends if the fire elemental is dispelled or destroyed, the burning creature dies, the flames are extinguished by immersion in water, or after 2 rounds elapse.\n\n**Water Elementals:** Water elementals appear as a large mass of watery waves. For every HD possessed by a water elemental, it will have a diameter of 2' and a height of 6”. For instance, a petty water elemental with 4 HD would be 2' high and have an 8' diameter. Water elementals can move across land at their swimming speed but can never move further than 60' from a water source.\n\nWater elementals always deal {C!} damage. They deal double damage dice when they hit opponents standing or submerged in water. When a water elemental damages a creature smaller than itself, the creature must make a Paralysis save with a -2 penalty per difference in size. If the save fails, the creature begins drowning.\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Elemental Characteristics by Element | | | | |\n| Element | Air | Earth | Fire | Water |\n| Speed (land) | None | 20’ / 60’ / 180’ | 40’ / 120’ / 360’ | Special |\n| Speed (fly) | 120’ / 360’ / 720’ | None | None | None |\n| Speed (swim) | None | None | None | 60’ / 180’ / 540’ |\n| Damage Type | {E!} | {Se!} | {F!} | {C!} |\n| Vision | Lightless Vision (60’) | Lightless Vision (60’) | Lightless Vision (120’) | Lightless Vision (60’) |\n| Other Senses | Aerial Mechanoreception | Terrestrial Mechanoreception | None | Aquatic Mechanoreception |\n| Immunity | Electrical | Seismic | Fire | Cold |\n\n###### Elemental Components\n\nA destroyed elemental can be harvested with Alchemy 2. The components that can be harvested depend on the elemental’s element.\n\n* Air - gaseous residue (*all air effects*)\n* Earth - solid residue (*all earth effects*)\n* Fire - burning residue (*all fire effects*)\n* Water - wet residue (*all water effects*.\n\nThe value and weight of the components that can be harvested depend on the elemental’s tier:\n\n* Petty – 135gp, 2 1/6 st.\n* Minor – 1,100gp, 18 2/6 st.\n* Major – 2,200gp, 36 4/6 st\n* Supreme – 3,300gp, 55 st\n\n",
