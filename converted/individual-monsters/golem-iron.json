  "markdown": "### Golem, Iron\n\nIron golems are magical constructs wrought of meteoric iron into man-like forms approximately 12’ tall and weighing almost 5 tons. Most iron golems are fastened to resemble warriors in plate armor with heavy helmets. Creating one involves the employment of mighty magic by exceptionally powerful clerics and mages.\n\nLike most constructs, iron golems have no true intelligence. The magic that animates them imbues them with just enough sapience to follow simple or standing orders from their creators.\n\n###### Combat\n\nWhen encountered, an iron golem’s reactions are always determined by its creator’s orders (even if given long, long ago).\n\nIn combat, iron golems smash foes with a powerful punch or huge weapon. If armed with a huge piercing or slashing weapon, an iron golem delivers a **vicious blow** that deal an additional 4 points per smash.\n\nIf armed with a huge bludgeoning weapon, an iron golem can **topple and fling** man-sized or smaller creatures with every attack. The creature struck must make a successful size-adjusted Paralysis saving throw or be knocked prone and forced back a number of feet equal to the damage dealt. The iron golem can cleave after a successful smash that forces back its target.\n\nIn addition, on the first round of combat and every 7 rounds thereafter, an iron golem can breathe out a 10’ x 10’ x 10’ **cloud of poisonous gas.** Each creature within the area of effect must make a Poison saving throw or immediately die.\n\nIron golems are very hard to hurt. An iron golem is **immune** to enchantment effects; cold, electrical, fire, necrotic, and poisonous damage; and all mundane damage. If hit by extraordinary electrical damage, an iron golem will be **queasy** for 3 rounds but not otherwise harmed. If hit by fire damage, an iron golem will heal a number of hit points equal to the damage dealt.\n\nAs constructs, they count as enchanted creatures for purposes of spells such as *dispel evil*and *holy circle*.\n\n###### Ecology\n\nAs constructs, iron golems have no natural habitat. They can be found guarding ancient treasures, dwarven vaults, or places of power or serving powerful spellcasters.\n\n###### Spoils\n\nA destroyed iron golem can be harvested with Magical Engineering for the following component:\n\n* iron head (120 st, 7200gp, *cloud of poison, energy invulnerability (cold, electrical, fire), giant strength, physical protection (all),* armor +2)\n\n![](data:image/png;base64...)\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Iron Golem Primary Characteristics** | |\n| **Type:** | Construct |\n| **Size:** | Huge (930 st.) |\n| **Speed (land):** | 20’ / 60’ |\n| **Armor Class:** | 6 |\n| **Hit Dice:** | 16\\*\\*\\*\\* |\n| **Attacks:** | 1 (smash -5+) |\n| **Damage:** | 3d10 {W!} |\n| **Save:** | F8 |\n| **Morale:** | N/A |\n| **Vision:** | Lightless Vision (60’) |\n| **Other Senses:** | Standard |\n| **Proficiencies:** | None |\n| **Normal Load:** | 305 st. |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Iron Golem Secondary Characteristics** | |\n| **Expedition Speed:** | 12 miles |\n| **Supply Cost:** | None |\n| **Training Period:** | Untrainable |\n| **Training Modifier:** | Untrainable |\n| **Battle Rating:** | 2.818 (individual), 56.5 (unit) |\n| **Lifespan:** | Indefinite |\n| **Reproduction:** | None |\n| **Untrained Value:** | 7,200gp (A) / - / - |\n| **Trained Value:** | 67,000gp |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Iron Golem Encounter Set-Up** | |\n| **Lair:** | 35% |\n| **Dungeon Enc:** | Solitary (1) |\n| **Wilderness Enc:** | Solitary (1) |\n| **Alignment:** | Neutral |\n| **Treasure Type:** | P |\n| **XP:** | 7,200 |\n\n",
