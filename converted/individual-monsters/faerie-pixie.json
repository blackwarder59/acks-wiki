  "markdown": "### Faerie, Pixie\n\nPixies resemble elves, save for their diminutive size (2’ tall) and insect- like wings. Like elves and unlike many other faeries, pixies come in two sexes, male and female, though both sexes have gracile forms and high piping voices.\n\nLike other faeries, pixies are found primarily in northern Aurëpos, particularly in Northern Argollë, Jutland, and Rorn. Though some dwell in Southern Argollë, they are otherwise very rare in the south, where nymphs predominate.\n\nPixies speak the lilting language of faeries and the languages spoken by the elves and humans of their region.\n\n###### Combat\n\nWhile pixies can fly, they have **weak wings.** A pixie can only fly for 3 turns before needing to land and rest its wings for 1 turn.\n\nPixies are naturally **invisible**, but can choose to become visible at will. Pixie invisibility is unlike the spell of the same name in that a pixie can act freely, including attacking, without becoming visible. However, the spell *discern invisibility* will reveal its presence.\n\nThey arm themselves with tiny bows that fire dart-sized arrows and with tiny swords the size of daggers. They prefer to attack by aerial ambush with their bows. They are **precise shots** capable of firing even into the chaos of melee.\n\n###### Ecology\n\nPixies dwell in treetop fastnesses similar to wood elves – but their fastnesses are always curiously “off,” as if they were built in imitation of elven architecture but without an understanding of their function. They often feature miniature staircases, for instance, even though pixies can fly.\n\nThey reproduce by breathing life into elven infants who have died of illness or infection. When an elven child dies it is a tragedy, but if the child’s body vanishes soon thereafter, the parents can stop grieving, knowing their child will live on as a pixie. The children remember their old life dimly as if a dream, which fades with time. The transformations require complex magic rituals performed in places of power on holy days.\n\n###### Spoils\n\nA slain pixie can be harvested with Healing 1 for the following component:\n\n* pixie dust (1/6 st, 16gp, *invisibility, shrinking, winged flight*)\n\n![](data:image/png;base64...)\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Pixie Primary Characteristics** | |\n| **Type:** | Enchanted Humanoid |\n| **Size:** | Small (1 ½ st.) |\n| **Speed (land):** | 30’ / 90’ |\n| **Speed (fly):** | 60’ / 180’ |\n| **Armor Class:** | 6 |\n| **Hit Dice:** | 1\\*\\* |\n| **Attacks:** | 1 (tiny bow or sword 10+) |\n| **Damage:** | 1d4 {P!} |\n| **Save:** | E1 |\n| **Morale:** | -1 |\n| **Vision:** | Lightless Vision (60’) |\n| **Other Senses:** | Standard |\n| **Proficiencies:** | Precise Shooting |\n| **Normal Load:** | 1 st. |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Pixie Secondary Characteristics** | |\n| **Expedition Speed:** | 54 miles (air) or 18 miles (land) |\n| **Supply Cost:** | 0.5gp |\n| **Training Period:** | 1 month (sapient) |\n| **Training Modifier:** | None (sapient) |\n| **Battle Rating:** | 0.122 (individual), 14.5 (unit) |\n| **Lifespan:** | 0/4/15/51/-/-/-/200 |\n| **Reproduction:** | Special |\n| **Untrained Value:** | 16gp (A)/85gp (J)/25gp (B) |\n| **Trained Value:** | 2,900gp |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Pixie Encounter Set-Up** | |\n| **Lair:** | 5% |\n| **Dungeon Enc:** | Flight (2d4) / Fastness (1d4x10) |\n| **Wilderness Enc:** | Wing (1d4x10) / Fastness (1d4x10) |\n| **Alignment:** | Neutral |\n| **Treasure Type:** | E |\n| **XP:** | 16 |\n\n",
