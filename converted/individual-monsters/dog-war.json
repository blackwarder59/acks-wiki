  "markdown": "### Dog, War\n\nWar dogs are heavy, fierce mastiffs trained to kill on command. While dangerous, they are capable of great loyalty to their masters when properly trained. When used in battle, war dogs are usually equipped with spiked scale barding, which increases AC to 5 and damage to 1d6+1.
