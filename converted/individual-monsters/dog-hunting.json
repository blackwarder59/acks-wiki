Both breeds are kept by humans and demi-humans throughout Aurëpos, and many feral or wild dogs of similar build are found throughout the countryside.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Region of Aurëpos | Hunting Dog Breed |\n| Auran Empire | Red Bloodhound (scent) |\n| Dwarves | Underterrier (scent) |\n| Elves | Argollëan Windhound (sight) |\n| Jutland | Jutting Mountain Cur (scent) |\n| Rorn | Rornish Staghound (sight) |\n| Sunset Kingdoms | Pharoah Hound (sight) |\n\n###### Combat\n\nHunting dogs have **acute hearing** and **acute olfaction.** They gain a +2 bonus to avoid surprise in their natural habitat.\n\nScent hounds can track the scent of creatures for up to 6 miles with the equivalent of three ranks of Tracking proficiency.

Juvenile dogs have AC 0, Spd 150’, HD 1/2, and attack with a bite (1d2 {P!}). Baby dogs have AC -1, Spd 150’, 1 hp, ML -4, and fight only with adorable nibbles that melt the heart but deal no damage.\n\n###### Spoils\n\nA slain hunting dog with extraordinary attributes can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following component:\n\n* heart (2/6 st, 15gp, *faithful companion, locate animal or pant, locate object*)\n\nAffable, intelligent, and pack-oriented, hunting dogs are exceptionally easy to train.\n\n###### Encounter\n\nA small farmhouse stands in a clearing just ahead, a compact field to one side.
