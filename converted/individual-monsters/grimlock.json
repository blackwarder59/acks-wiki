They are virtually never seen on the surface, and few sages are even aware of their existence; of those that are, most believe that “grimlocks are to morlocks what morlocks are to men: twisted and degenerate dwellers of the underdark below.”\n\nOnly those who have plumbed the darkest of the ancient annals know the truth: The grimlocks were created as a servitor race by the khepri (see p. XX), who crossbred morlocks with various subterranean creatures. They were made eyeless so that the khepri could freely expose their true faces without driving their minions to madness. Since the destruction of the khepri kingdoms, the grimlocks have eked out a savage existence.\n\nThe Grimlock tongue is a debased dialect of Khepri. Leaders have a 10% chance per HD of knowing the language of another subterranean species, such as dwarves, morlocks, or troglodytes.\n\n###### Combat\n\nGrimlocks have **dull gray skin** that resembles stone. Characters encountering grimlocks in mountains or underground have a -2 penalty to surprise rolls.\n\nThough grimlocks are **blind**, they possess **echolocation** (120’)that enable them to easily navigate the world around them.No spells or effects that would ordinarily blind a creature will affect a grimlock, but *inaudible* creatures are hidden from them, and *noiselessness* blinds them.\n\n###### Ecology\n\nEach grimlock gang will be led by a champion with 3 AC, 3 HD, 16 hp, and a +2 damage bonus. Each grimlock warband will be led by a sub-chieftain with 4 AC, 4 HD, 20 hp, and a +2 damage bonus. A grimlock lair or vault will be led by a chieftain with 5 AC, 6 HD, 28 hp, and a +3 damage bonus. As long as the chieftain is alive, the grimlocks will gain a +2 bonus to morale rolls. Grimlock lairs and vaults will have drudges and whelps equal to 100% and 200% of the number of warriors, respectively. Grimlock drudges fight as morlocks, while grimlock whelps have AC 0, Spd 90’, 1 hp, ML -4, and do not fight.\n\nWhen grimlocks are encountered in a vault, certain additional creatures will be present. There is a 50% chance for 1d10 enslaved captives per warband. In addition, a vault has a 50% chance of a shaman being present, and a 25% chance of a witch doctor. A shaman is equivalent to sub-chieftain statistically, but has Shaman abilities at level 1d6. A witch doctor is equivalent to a champion statistically, but has Mage abilities at level 1d4. Finally, there is a 5% chance that a khepri will be present, ruling over the grimlocks.\n\n###### Spoils\n\nA slain grimlock can be harvested with Healing for the following component:\n\n* ears (2/6 st, 20gp, *cause blindness, inaudibility, noiselessness*)\n\n![](data:image/png;base64...)\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Grimlock Primary Characteristics** | |\n| **Type:** | Humanoid |\n| **Size:** | Man-sized (22 st.) |\n| **Speed (land):** | 40’ / 120’ |\n| **Armor Class:** | 2 |\n| **Hit Dice:** | 2 |\n| **Attacks:** | 1 (weapon 9+) |\n| **Damage:** | By weapon +1 {W} |\n| **Save:** | F2 |\n| **Morale:** | +2 |\n| **Vision:** | Blind |\n| **Other Senses:** | Echolocation (120’) |\n| **Proficiencies:** | Caving 11+ |\n| **Normal Load:** | 7 st. |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Grimlock Secondary Characteristics** | |\n| **Expedition Speed:** | 24 miles |\n| **Supply Cost:** | 2gp (carnivorous) |\n| **Training Period:** | 1 month (sapient) |\n| **Training Modifier:** | None (sapient) |\n| **Battle Rating:** | 0.028 (individual), 3.5 (unit) |\n| **Lifespan:** | 0/1/12/16/30/45/60/75 |\n| **Reproduction:** | 1 infant per 3 years |\n| **Untrained Value:** | 20gp (A) / 16gp (J) / 12gp (B) |\n| **Trained Value:** | 660gp |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Grimlock Encounter Set-Up** | |\n| **Lair:** | 35% |\n| **Dungeon Enc:** | Gang (1d12) / Lair (1 warband) |\n| **Wilderness Enc:** | Warband (1d8 gangs) / Vault (1d3 warbands) |\n| **Alignment:** | Chaotic |\n| **Treasure Type:** | G (per warband) |\n| **XP:** | 20 (warrior), 50 (champion), 80 (sub-chief), 320 (chief) |\n\n",
