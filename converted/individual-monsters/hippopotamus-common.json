  "markdown": "### Hippopotamus, Common\n\nThe hippopotamus is an aggressive semi-aquatic mammal feared for its unpredictable temperament and powerful bite. A typical hippo weighs around 7,000 lbs and measures 12’ - 16' long from nose to rump. In Aurëpos, the behemoths are found primarily in Kemesh along the banks of the Kem River. They are widespread in the rivers and lakes of Ulrukan.\n\n###### Combat\n\nHippos are aggressive and territorial. Reaction rolls when encountering them are made at a -2 penalty.\n\nDue to their powerful jaws, hippos have **bone-breaking bites**. If the hippo succeeds on an attack throw with an unmodified 20, the creature bitten must make a Death saving throw. If the save succeeds, the creature suffers double the ordinary damage dice (6d6 {P!}). If the save fails, the creature suffers triple the ordinary damage (9d6 {P!}) and has a limb broken. Roll 1d6 to determine which limb is broken: 1-2 weapon hand, 3 weapon arm, 4-5 near leg, 6 far leg.\n\nA broken limb has the same game effect as a missing limb (***ACKS II RR***Permanent Wounds tables, p. XX – XX) until it heals. A broken wound heals after 180 days, or 90 days under treatment of a healer.\n\nHippos can also attempt to **trample** their opponents. A hippo gains a +4 bonus to attack throws when attempting to trample a creature of large size or smaller. If a trample attack succeeds against such a creature, the creature must make a Paralysis saving throw. A small creature saves at -8, a man-sized creature at -6, and a large creature at -4. If the save fails, the creature takes damage, then is forced aside 10’ (to a point left or right of the hippo), landing **prone**. If the saving throw succeeds, the creature takes damage but is not forced aside. A hippo can cleave after a successful trample attack that forces aside a creature.\n\n###### Ecology\n\nWhen hippos are encountered, the adults will be accompanied by 2d8 juvenile hippos and 2d6 baby hippos. Juvenile hippos are large size, have 4 AC, Spd 75’/60’ swim, 4+1 HD, and attack by biting (1d10 {P!}) or trampling (1d10 {B!}). Juvenile hippos can only take a +4 bonus versus and force aside small creatures, which save at -4. Baby hippos are man-sized, have AC 3, Spd 75’/60’ swim, HD 2+3, and attack by biting (1d4 {P!}).\n\nThough powerful, hippos are both dumb and surly, and as such rarely trained.\n\n###### Spoils\n\nA slain hippo with exceptional attributes can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following components useful in magic research:\n\n* jawbone (18 1/3, 1000gp, *swimming,* armor +1, weapon +2)\n\nA hippopotamus’s huge incisors fetch 18gp and weigh 2/6 st.\n\n![](data:image/png;base64...)\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Common Hippopotamus Primary Characteristics** | |\n| **Type:** | Animal (wild) |\n| **Size:** | Huge (700 st.) |\n| **Speed (land):** | 30’ / 90’ |\n| **Speed (swim):** | 25’ / 75’ |\n| **Armor Class:** | 3 |\n| **Hit Dice:** | 8+2\\* |\n| **Attacks:** | 1 (bite or trample 3+) |\n| **Damage:** | 3d6 {P!} or 4d4 {B!} |\n| **Save:** | F4 |\n| **Morale:** | +2 |\n| **Vision:** | Standard |\n| **Other Senses:** | Standard |\n| **Proficiencies:** | None |\n| **Normal Load:** | 140 st. |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Common Hippopotamus Secondary Characteristics** | |\n| **Expedition Speed:** | 18 miles (land) or 15 miles (water) |\n| **Supply Cost:** | 12gp |\n| **Training Period:** | 12 months |\n| **Training Modifier:** | -1 |\n| **Battle Rating:** | 0.194 (individual), 4 (unit) |\n| **Lifespan:** | 0/3/7/15/30/40/50/60 |\n| **Reproduction:** | 1 calf every 3 years |\n| **Untrained Value:** | 150gp (A)/ 17gp (J) / 7.5gp |\n| **Trained Value:** | 4,200gp (hunter) |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Common Hippopotamus Encounter Set-Up** | |\n| **Lair:** | None |\n| **Dungeon Enc:** | None |\n| **Wilderness Enc:** | Herd (6d6) |\n| **Alignment:** | Neutral |\n| **Treasure Type:** | None |\n| **XP:** | 1,100 |\n\n",
