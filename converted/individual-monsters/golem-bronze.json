Most bronze golems are fastened to resemble giant bronze-armored warriors from archaic eras. A typical bronze golem stands 10’ tall and (being solid bronze) weighs almost 5 tons. Creating one involves the employment of mighty magic by exceptionally powerful spellcasters.\n\nLike most constructs, bronze golems have no true intelligence. The magic that animates them imbues them with just enough sapience to follow simple or standing orders from their creators.\n\n###### Combat\n\nWhen encountered, a bronze golem’s reactions are always determined by its creator’s orders (even if given long, long ago).\n\nIn combat, bronze golems smash foes with a powerful punch or huge weapon. If armed with a huge piercing or slashing weapon, a bronze golem delivers a **vicious blow** that deal an additional 4 points per smash. If armed with a huge bludgeoning weapon, a bronze golem can **topple and fling** man-sized or smaller creatures with every attack (p. XX). The creature struck must make a successful size-adjusted Paralysis saving throw or be knocked **prone** and forced back a number of feet equal to the damage dealt. The bronze golem can cleave after a successful smash that forces back its target.\n\nBronze golems are **immune** to enchantment effects; fire, necrotic, and poisonous damage; and all types of mundane damage. As constructs, they count as enchanted creatures for purposes of spells such as *dispel evil*and *holy circle*.\n\nIf a bronze golem suffers piercing or slashing damage in melee, the creature that dealt the damage must make a Blast saving throw. If the save succeeds, there is no effect.
