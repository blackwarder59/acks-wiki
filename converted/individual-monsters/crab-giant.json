  "markdown": "### Crab, Giant\n\nThese giant cousins to ordinary crabs are about 12’ in diameter and weigh up to 500 lbs. They can be found in any watery environment, but because they do not have to remain fully submerged they can also be found prowling along fresh or saltwater shores, marshes, and watery subterranean caves. Giant crabs are unintelligent, and exist merely to eat and reproduce.\n\n###### Combat\n\nBecause they often dwell in lightless caverns or dark depths, giant crabs rely on **aquatic** **mechanoreception** (60’ range). Spells or effects that would ordinarily cause blindness do not affect crab using mechanoreception. However, creatures that are not in the water are invisible to their mechanoreception. Aquatic mechanoreception does not penetrate structures or terrain features.\n\nWhen they detect prey, giant crabs attack with their powerful pincers, which deal 2d6 {P}damage each. If a giant crab successfully attacks the same target with both pincers in the same attack routine, it immediately **rends** the creature for another 2d6 {Se}damage.\n\nGiant crabs possess the equivalent of Combat Trickery (wrestling). When attacking fast-moving prey, giant crabs will often use one pincer topin a target with a Wrestling special maneuver, then use the other pincer to tear them apart.\n\n###### Ecology\n\nWhen a colony of giant crabs is encountered, there is a 20% chance per crab that it will be incubating a clutch of 2d6 eggs. The eggs have 1 hp and weigh 3/6 st. Crab hatchlings are rarely found in colonies, because the hatchlings immediately disperse into the waters after they emerge from their eggs.\n\n###### Spoils\n\nA slain giant crab can be harvested with Animal Husbandry 2 for the following component:\n\n* carapace fragment (5/6 st, 50gp, armor +2)\n\nIf not used for magic research, a giant crab's armored carapace fetches 50gp and weighs 1 2/6 st.\n\n###### Encounter\n\nA limestone cave mouth gapes some 11’ wide and 3’ high in the cliffs near the water’s edge.
