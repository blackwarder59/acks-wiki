They use this power to draw ominous and unpleasant weather to their lairs, discouraging outsiders from approaching, or to punish local settlements with drought, frost, or storm.\n\nFar more formidable, however, is their ability to grow in stature. A spriggan can **enlarge** as a spell-like ability at will. While enlarged, the spriggan stands 8’ tall and weighs 480 lbs.
