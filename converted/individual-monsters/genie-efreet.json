They stand 12’ tall and have fire- or soot-colored skin, flaming eyes, and horns. Their devilish aspect and malevolent nature leads to them sometimes being confused with báleygr, but efreeti are elemental, not demonic, creatures.\n\nEfreet speak their own language, as well as Ancient Zaharan, Classical Auran, Common, Opelenean, and Shebatean.\n\n###### Combat\n\nEfreeti have several **spell-like abilities**, each of which can be used thrice per day: *boil blood, burning sparks, create food, create water, create objects, invisibility, perpetual figment, wall of flame, weave fire*. All function at caster level 13.\n\nEach use of *create objects* can create up to 10 st of objects worth up to 100gp / st. The craftsmanship in created objects is equivalent to 3 ranks of Crafting proficiency. An efreet summoned by ritual magic can create permanent objects, but one summoned by spells can only create temporary objects. These vanish when *dispelled* or the summoning ends.\n\nAs a full-round action, when near a brazier or fire, an efreet can become a 30’ tall **fiery pillar** with a 10’ diameter. When in pillar form, the djinni can move at a combat speed of 30’ over land. If the fiery pillar moves onto or through a creature, or a creature moves into or through the pillar, the creature must make a Blast saving throw. If the save fails, the creature takes 2d6 {F!} damage. If the save succeeds, the creature takes half that damage. If the fiery pillar moves onto a structure, the structure takes 2d6 {F!} structural damage. The pillar can move through creatures without penalty, but it must ends its movement if it moves onto a structure. The pillar cannot move across bodies of water.
