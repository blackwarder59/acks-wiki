They are often summoned by mages to render services and sometimes bound in bottles, rings, and other items.\n\nGenies from the Elemental Sphere of Water are called marids. They stand 15’9” tall and have aquamarine complexions, grey-green eyes, and blue-tinted black hair. They dress in flowing clothing adorned with fine jewelry. Marid speak their own language, as well as Ancient Zaharan, Classical Auran, Common, Opelenean, and Shebatean.\n\n###### Combat\n\nMarids have several **spell-like abilities**, each of which can be used thrice per day: *capsizing wave, create food, create water, create objects, invisibility, level water, perpetual figment, water breathing, and weave water*. All these abilities function at caster level 14.\n\nEach use of *create objects* can create up to 10 st of objects worth up to 100gp / st. The craftsmanship in created objects is equivalent to 3 ranks of Crafting proficiency. An efreet summoned by ritual magic can create permanent objects, but one summoned by spells can only create temporary objects. These vanish when *dispelled* or the summoning ends.\n\nAs a full-round action, a marid can become a **frigid wave** 24’ wide and 12’ high. When in wave form, the marid can move at a combat speed of 30’ over land and 60’ over water. If the wave moves onto or through one or more creatures during the move, each such creature must make a Blast saving throw. If the throw fails, the wave deals 3d6 {C!} damage and forces the creature contacted to make a swimming throw or begin drowning. If the wave moves onto or through one or more vessels during its move, each vessel takes 3d6 {C!} structural damage. If the vessel is a galley or longship, its captain must also make a successful Seafaring throw of 16+ (12+ if master mariner) or the vessel capsizes and begins sinking. The wave can move through creatures and vessels without penalty, but it cannot move through or damage structures. The genie can revert to its true form at the end of its initiative if desired. If the marid’s movement in wave form carried it onto land, the marid must revert to its true form at the end of its initiative.\n\nAll marids are **immune** to mundane damage and cold damage.\n\nA marid summoned with ritual magic can be compelled to grant up to 3 *wishes* in lieu of other services. (No effect short of ritual magic can compel or influence a marid’s response to a ***wish*** in any way.) Marid are difficult to break to a spellcaster’s will, so magical items calling upon marid are rare.\n\n###### Ecology\n\nIn the Elemental Sphere of Water, the marids dwell in underwater cities that bob and drift in the depths of an infinite ocean. They appear on Aurëpos when called forth by a spell or well of elemental water.\n\n###### Spoils\n\nA destroyed marid can be harvested with Alchemy 2 for the following component:\n\n![](data:image/png;base64...)\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Marid Primary Characteristics** | |\n| **Type:** | Incarnation (elemental) |\n| **Size:** | Large (270 st.) |\n| **Speed (land):** | 30’ / 90’ |\n| **Speed (fly):** | 50’ / 150’ |\n| **Speed (swim):** | 80’ / 240’ |\n| **Armor Class:** | 9 |\n| **Hit Dice:** | 12\\*\\*\\* |\n| **Attacks:** | 1 (slam -1+) |\n| **Damage:** | 2d12 {B!} |\n| **Save:** | F18 |\n| **Morale:** | +4 |\n| **Vision:** | Lightless Vision (60’) |\n| **Other Senses:** | Standard |\n| **Proficiencies:** | None |\n| **Normal Load:** | 120 st. |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Marid Secondary Characteristics** | |\n| **Expedition Speed:** | 60 miles (air), 48 miles (water), 18 miles (land) |\n| **Supply Cost:** | None |\n| **Training Period:** | 1 month (sapient) |\n| **Training Modifier:** | None (sapient) |\n| **Battle Rating:** | 15.350 (individual), 921 (unit) |\n| **Lifespan:** | Indefinite |\n| **Reproduction:** | None |\n| **Untrained Value:** | 3,900gp (A) / - / - |\n| **Trained Value:** | 365,000gp (controlled) |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Marid Encounter Set-Up** | |\n| **Lair:** | None |\n| **Dungeon Enc:** | Solitary (1) |\n| **Wilderness Enc:** | Solitary (1) |\n| **Alignment:** | Neutral |\n| **Treasure Type:** | None |\n| **XP:** | 3,900 |\n\n* blue ichor (65 st, 3,900gp, *bane-rune, capsizing wave, create food, create water, energy invulnerability (cold), invisibility, level water, perpetual figment, water breathing, weave water, wish*)\n\n",
