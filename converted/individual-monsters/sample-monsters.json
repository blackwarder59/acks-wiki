    "markdown": "### Acanthaspis, Giant\n\nThe giant acanthaspis, also known as the giant assassin bug, is a horrific predator with a taste for fresh meat. When full grown, it measures about 10' long and weighs about 800 lbs, with six legs and a short segmented beak. The beak injects acidic enzymes into the bug’s victims, digesting them from the inside so their liquified innards can be sucked out like milk.\n\n###### Combat\n\nAfter killing a victim, the acanthaspis secures the corpse on its glossy black carapace with sticky secretions, wearing its victims as **corpse** **armor.** When first encountered, an acanthaspis will have secured 2d10 corpses to itself. Each corpse can absorb 1hp of damage before being destroyed. It takes 1 turn for an acanthaspis to secure a new corpse to itself.\n\nWhen an acanthaspis successfully bites a creature, the creature struck must make a Paralysis saving throw. If the save succeeds, the attack deals 3d6 {P!} damage but has no other effect. If the save fails, the attack deals 3d6 {P!} damage and the creature is **grabbed**. The acanthaspis immediately injects the grabbed creature with digestive enzymes that deal 1d4 {A!} damage. While the creature remains grabbed, the acanthaspis can use its combat action to automatically deal another 1d4 {A!} damage to the creature each round. Once the acidic damage reduces the grabbed creature to 0 or fewer hp, the acanthaspis immediately sucks out its melted innards, killing it instantly.\n\nIf desperate or frustrated, an acanthaspis can spew a 30’ x 5’ line of **acidic spit**. Any creature in the area of effect must make a Blast saving throw. If the save fails, the creature takes 4d8 {A!} damage. If the save succeeds, it takes half that damage. One such attack depletes the acanthaspis’s acid supply for 6 hours, so it will only spit acid when reduced to fewer than half its hit points or when it has failed to grab an opponent.\n\n###### Ecology\n\nWhen acanthaspis are encountered in a wilderness nest, there is a 25% chance per creature that it will have 1d4 eggs buried nearby. Acanthaspis eggs have 1 hp and weigh 4/6 st. Acanthaspis nymphs are rarely found in nests, because the nymphs immediately disperse into the wild after they emerge from their eggs.\n\n###### Spoils\n\nA slain acanthaspis can be harvested with Animal Husbandry 2 for the following components useful in magic research:\n\n* acid gland (4 2/6 st, 260gp, *rain of vitriol, vitriolic infusion*)\n* antennae (2 st, 120gp, *locate animal/plant, locate object*)\n* mandible (2 st, 120gp, *choking grip, halt humanoid*)\n\nIf not used for magic research, an acanthaspis’s mandibles fetch 18gp and weigh 2/6 st.

    "markdown": "### Ant, Giant\n\nWhich foul demon or mad sorcerer first bred ants of gigantic size is unknown to even the wisest sages of Aura, but all agree that it was a terrible mistake. Adaptable, implacable, and omnivorous, giant ants are a scourge that can reduce a fertile field or woodland to a wasteland in a day.\n\nLike their diminutive cousins, ants are divided into castes of workers, soldiers, and queens. Workers are about 5' long and weigh about 150 lbs. Soldiers are about 6’ to 7’ long and weigh approximately 250 lbs. Queens are immense, measuring 7’ to 9’ long and weighing about 400 lbs.\n\n###### Combat\n\nGiant ants are not aggressive unless their nests are invaded. In that case, the ants are automatically Hostile and gain a +4 bonus to morale rolls provided their queen is still alive.\n\nThey use **terrestrial mechanoreception** to sense vibration in the ground over long distances equivalent to line of sight in full daylight. Spells or effects that would ordinarily cause blindness do not affect the ant when its using terrestrial mechanoreception. However, creatures that are flying, levitating, or otherwise not touching the ground are invisible to the sense. Terrestrial mechanoreception can penetrate structures and terrain features.\n\n###### Ecology\n\nMost giant ants are workers, but for every 5 workers there will be one soldier. When giant ants are encountered in their nest, there will always be one queen guarded by 2d4 additional soldiers. There will also be 3d10 larvae and 2d6 eggs. Larva have AC 4, Spd 150’, HD 2, and attack with 1 bite (1d6 {P}). Eggs have 1 hp and weigh 2/6 st. Roll 1d20 per egg: 1 – queen egg, 2-6 soldier egg, 7+, worker ant egg.\n\n###### Spoils\n\nGiants ants tend to have incidental treasure around their nests, left over from past opponents, but in some rare instances giant ants will inexplicably mine precious metals.

    "html": "<h3>Ant, Giant</h3>\n<p>Which foul demon or mad sorcerer first bred ants of gigantic size is unknown to even the wisest sages of Aura, but all agree that it was a terrible mistake. Adaptable, implacable, and omnivorous, giant ants are a scourge that can reduce a fertile field or woodland to a wasteland in a day.</p>\n<p>Like their diminutive cousins, ants are divided into castes of workers, soldiers, and queens. Workers are about 5&#39; long and weigh about 150 lbs. Soldiers are about 6’ to 7’ long and weigh approximately 250 lbs. Queens are immense, measuring 7’ to 9’ long and weighing about 400 lbs.</p>\n<h6>Combat</h6>\n<p>Giant ants are not aggressive unless their nests are invaded. In that case, the ants are automatically Hostile and gain a +4 bonus to morale rolls provided their queen is still alive.</p>\n<p>They use <strong>terrestrial mechanoreception</strong> to sense vibration in the ground over long distances equivalent to line of sight in full daylight. Spells or effects that would ordinarily cause blindness do not affect the ant when its using terrestrial mechanoreception. However, creatures that are flying, levitating, or otherwise not touching the ground are invisible to the sense. Terrestrial mechanoreception can penetrate structures and terrain features.</p>\n<h6>Ecology</h6>\n<p>Most giant ants are workers, but for every 5 workers there will be one soldier. When giant ants are encountered in their nest, there will always be one queen guarded by 2d4 additional soldiers. There will also be 3d10 larvae and 2d6 eggs. Larva have AC 4, Spd 150’, HD 2, and attack with 1 bite (1d6 {P}). Eggs have 1 hp and weigh 2/6 st. Roll 1d20 per egg: 1 – queen egg, 2-6 soldier egg, 7+, worker ant egg.</p>\n<h6>Spoils</h6>\n<p>Giants ants tend to have incidental treasure around their nests, left over from past opponents, but in some rare instances giant ants will inexplicably mine precious metals. Mining will be evident in 5% of nests, where there will be as much as 1d10x1000 gold pieces worth of raw gold nuggets. At the Judge’s discretion, a giant ant nest can be treated as a gold vein (see <em><strong>By This Axe</strong></em> for details).</p>\n<p>A slain worker ant can be harvested with Animal Husbandry 2 for the following components useful in magic research:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>antennae (4/6 st., 40gp, <em>locate treasure</em>)</li>\n<li>chitinous plates (4/6 st., 40gp, armor +1, weapon +1)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A slain soldier can be harvested for components worth and weighing 250% more (1 4/6 st, 100gp). A slain queen can be harvested for components worth and weighing 400% more (4 st., 160gp).</p>\n<p><img src=\"data:image/jpeg;base64...\" alt=\"Giant Ant | The Neverwinter

They weigh about 570 lbs, with have hairless, glossy, purple-black carapaces and an overlarge central pair of eyes surrounded by others. Although they may be mistaken for any giant spider, arane are anything but unthinking.\n\nSly, patient, and intelligent, the arane weave plots as deftly as they weave a web, and often work with others of their kind, surrounding themselves with frightened minions or others of a similarly wicked nature. The relationship between arane and attercops is not known to the sages of Aura. Some legends claim that the arane were once cultists of a demonic attercop who transformed themselves using foul alchemy to become more like their “god.”\n\nArane speak a dialect of Ancient Zaharan modified to accommodate their arachnid articulators.\n\n###### Combat\n\nArane craftily place webs in strategic locations around their lairs. Any creature without a webcrawling speed that moves into the webs becomes **webbed**. The arane can detect vibrations caused by webbed creatures through their **webbed mechanoreception**.\n\nArane can also spray webbing up to 30’ to capture victims and keep them restrained for later consumption. These swift bursts of webbing can be released up to 3 times per day. The webbings cover a 10’-diameter area. Any creatures in the area must make Blast saving throws. If the save succeeds, the creature avoids the webbing, but must move out of the area on its next initiative or become affected. If the save fails, the creature becomes **webbed.**\n\nThe bite of an arane is **venomous**, and any creature bitten must make a Death saving throw.

    "markdown": "### Attercop, Demonic\n\nThe mother of monsters, called Iskara by the Aurans, created the demonic attercops by infusing cacodemon ichor into the bodies of giant spiders. These hell-spawned arachnids measure 12’ long with legs tipped with iron-hard claws that stretch to 9’ and bodies weighing a titanic 2,300 lbs. They dwell in the fetid swamps, dark forests, and high mountains of the wild.\n\nDemonic attercops are nowadays very rare, but they have spawned many children: All of the various lesser attercops are descended, by way of repeated mating with giant spiders, from the demonic attercop.\n\nAttercops are sapient and speak their own horrific language. Scholars who have studied Ancient Zaharan, Khepri, and Thrassian find certain similarities in the attercop tongue.\n\n###### Combat\n\nDemonic attercops are ambush predators, and creatures encountering attercops suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls due to the spiders’ **natural stealth**.\n\nA demonic attercop **is dreadful** to confront.A creature which starts its initiative, or moves within, 60’ of a demonic attercop must make a Paralysis saving throw. If the save succeeds, the creature gains immunity to the effects of every attercop’s dreadfulness for 1 turn. If the save fails, the creature starts **faltering.** If the creature was already faltering, it becomes **frightened** instead. The faltering or frightened condition ends if removed magically or if the demonic attercop is destroyed or no longer within 60’.\n\nTo aid in ambush, demonic attercops spin webs in strategic locations around their lairs. They use these webs to entangle victims in their webs in order to capture them and keep them fresh for later consumption. They can also spin a web around a target as a melee attack. If a creature moves into an attercop’s web, or if an attercop succeeds on a webspinning attack throw against a creature, that creature becomes **webbed.**\n\nA demonic attercop’s **webbed mechanoreception** enables it to “see” any creatures touching their webs.\n\nA demonic attercop can attack by spinning a web (above), biting, or goring with its great horns. If it bites its target, it deals 4d10 {P!} damage and injects a **deadly** **venom**. A creature damaged by an attercop’s bite must make a Death saving throw at -4. If the save succeeds, the creature is not affected by the venom. If the save fails, then creature suffers 10d6 {Po!} damage and becomes **paralyzed** for 2d4 turns at the end of the attercop’s initiative. The paralysis can be cured by *neutralize poison* but not *cure light injury.* When the paralysis wears off, the poisoned creature is **fatigued**. The fatigue ends if the poison is neutralized or after the creature enjoys 8 hours of restful sleep.\n\nIf it gores its target, it deals 2d10 {P!} damage per horn. If at least one horn hits, the target must make a successful size-adjusted Paralysis save or be knocked prone.\n\nIf both horns hit, the target is automatically knocked **prone**. If the target is knocked prone, the demonic attercop can then either make a bite attack or make 4 attacks with its clawed legs, each dealing 2d10 {S!} damage on a successful hit.\n\nDemonic attercops have many-layered hides that make them **immune** to mundane physical damage. When damaged, demonic attercops **brood in darkness**,regenerating 3 hp per round provided that they remain stationary and are not exposed to any light. They can even regenerate lost limbs or eyes, given sufficient time.\n\n###### Ecology\n\nDemonic attercops can reproduce with other attercops as well as with the various species of giant spider. When encountered in a wilderness lair, there is a 5% chance the demonic attercop is watching over a clutch of eggs. The nature and number of these eggs will depend on the species with which the she copulated. Roll 1d10 to find out: 1, another attercop; 2-4, a giant tarantula; 5-7, a giant black widow; 8-10, a giant crab spider.\n\nIf the mother bred with any other attercop, she’ll have lain 1 demonic attercop egg. If the mother bred with a giant tarantula, she’ll have lain 1d4 monstrous attercop eggs; if with a giant black widow, 4d6 hideous attercop eggs; and if with a giant crab spider, 6d6 foul attercop eggs. Demonic attercop eggs have 1 hp and weigh 4 st each. (See the other attercop entries for the smaller eggs.)\n\nNormally the spiderlings disperse upon hatching, but the demonic influence of the attercop sometimes causes them to lair nearby, creating a fell region infested with arachnids.\n\n###### spoils\n\nA slain demonic attercop can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the following components useful in magic research:\n\n* carapace (15 st, 900gp, *physical invulnerability (all), tenebrosity*)\n* horns (15st, 900gp, *cone of fear, inspire horror, panic*)\n* mandibles (11 st, 650gp, *poison*)\n* leg tarsus (10 st, 600gp, *spider climb*)\n* spinneret (10 st, 600gp, *chameleon, webbing*)\n\nIf not used for magic research, a demonic attercop’s mandibles fetch 40gp and weigh 4/6 st. Its venom (onset time 1 round, no saving modifier, paralysis for 1d4 turns and 5d6 {Po} damage on failed Death saving throw) fetches 1,000gp and weighs 1/6 st.\n\n###### Encounter\n\nA Zaharan temple portico has been carved into the face of a rocky cliff at an elevation of some 100’. An entryway, visible as a black silhouette from ground level, suggests there is a rock-cut interior within. A narrow rubble-strewn trail (which requires a balancing traverse to ascend) slowly winds a 200’ course upward to the portico.\n\nAdventurers who ascend to investigate discover that the temple portico once carried bas-relief engravings, now difficult to decipher because of age and erosion – all that remains visible is a cluster of stone spheres, two large and six small, arranged in pairs.\n\nThe rock-cut temple inside has a left-right width of 60’ and a length longer than torchlight can reveal (75’), such that rear of the temple shrouded in darkness.\n\nIn the darkness lurks Uttu, one of the last of the demonic attercops created by Iskara before the Day Without Night. Uttu rests upon a pyramid of bones built from her victims over the years, the whole bound together with webbing to form a bed for her great bulk. Uttu’s dreadful aura extends out 60’, so any adventurer who moves more than 15’ into the temple must immediately begin to make Paralysis saves.\n\n**Demonic Attercop:** Spd 60’ / 120’ web, AC 10, HD 10\\*\\*\\*\\*, hp 55, #AT 1 (bite or web 1+) or 2 (horns 1+), Dmg 4d20 {P!} + poison, web, or 2d10 {P!}, Save F10, ML +1, AL C, XP 3,650; Special: dreadful, knockdown, regeneration, immunity\n\nUttu’s treasure is hidden within the sticky webbed bone pyramid of her fallen victims. Removing the treasure from the webbing by hand is a pain-staking process that will require 8 man-hours. Adventurers who burn off the webs can retrieve the treasure in 1 man-hour, but burning the webs destroys the scrolls in the hoard.\n\nThe treasure consists of 4,000ep; 4,000gp; a wrought silver signet ring (500gp); a pair of wrought bronze bulls (100gp each); a pair of chryselephantine statuettes of Iskara (700gp each); a crown of wrought orichalcum with thousands of tiny diamonds (4,000gp); a **wand of thunderbolts**(appears as a short stick with wavering grooves down its length, 12 charges); a **potion of adjust self**(slowly changes hue each turn); a **potion of vigor** (silver tint, euphoric sensation when tasted); a bronzewood scroll box containing a **scroll of magic warding**,scroll of demon warding, **scroll of discern magic**, and scroll of **banner of invincibility and passageway**; a pouch with **dust of revelation** (14 pinches, no apparent value); a stitched leather quiver with **17 arrows +3** (fletched of dawn redwood with eagle feathers), a **battle axe +1** (double-bladed dwarven bearing the sigil of Azen Khador); and, lastly, a set of two backwards-curved elven short swords with pommels carved in the shape of a great dawn redwood.\n\nThe first sword in the set is a **short sword +1, +3 vs. undead**. Its blade is carved with runes of law and luminous power. The second sword is a **short sword +1, +3 vs. beastmen**; its blade is carved with runes of smiting and vengeance. A successful Loremastery proficiency throw identifies these weapons as *Dorn na Marbh* (“doom to the dead”) and *Dorn na Beithíoch* (“doom to the beastly”), famously wielded by the elven hero Caoimhin ua Orthanach, who disappeared in an expedition in 184 IY.\n\n![](data:image/png;base64...)\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Demonic Attercop Primary Characteristics** | |\n| **Type:** | Monstrosity (sapient) |\n| **Size:** | Huge (230 st.) |\n| **Speed (land):** | 20’ / 60’ |\n| **Speed (web):** | 40’ / 120’ |\n| **Armor Class:** | 10 |\n| **Hit Dice:** | 10\\*\\*\\*\\* |\n| **Attacks:** | 1 (bite or web 1+) or 2 (horns 1+) |\n| **Damage:** | 4d10 {P!} + poison, web or  2d10 {P!} |\n| **Save:** | F10 |\n| **Morale:** | +1 |\n| **Vision:** | Lightless Vision |\n| **Other Senses:** | Webbed Mechanoreception |\n| **Proficiencies:** | None |\n| **Normal Load:** | 280 st. |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Demonic Attercop Secondary Characteristics** | |\n| **Expedition Speed:** | 12 miles |\n| **Supply Cost:** | 48gp (carnivorous) |\n| **Training Period:** | 1 month (sapient) |\n| **Training Modifier:** | None (sapient) |\n| **Battle Rating:** | 3.935 (individual), 78.5 (unit) |\n| **Lifespan:** | E/2.25/35/140/220/330/440/550 |\n| **Reproduction:** | 1 set of eggs every 30 years |\n| **Untrained Value:** | 4,650gp (A)/2,475gp (J)/1,215gp (E) |\n| **Trained Value:** | 93,500gp (sapient) |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Demonic Attercop Encounter Set-Up** | |\n| **Lair:** | 70% |\n| **Dungeon Enc:** | Solitary (1) / Lair (1) |\n| **Wilderness Enc:** | Solitary (1) / Lair (1) |\n| **Alignment:** | Chaotic |\n| **Treasure Type:** | N, H x2 |\n| **XP:** | 3,650 |\n\n",

The fatigue ends if the poison is neutralized or after the creature enjoys 8 hours of restful sleep.</p>\n<p>To aid in ambush, monstrous attercops spin webs in strategic locations around their lairs. They use these webs to entangle victims in their webs in order to capture them and keep them fresh for later consumption. They can also spin a web around a target as a melee attack. If a creature moves into an attercop’s web, or if an attercop succeeds on a webspinning attack throw against a creature, that creature becomes <strong>webbed.</strong></p>\n<p>The attercop’s <strong>webbed mechanoreception</strong> enables them to “see” any creatures touching their webs.</p>\n<h6>Ecology</h6>\n<p>Monstrous attercops can reproduce with any other attercops; the mother determines the resultant offspring.

    "markdown": "### Báleygr\n\nBáleygr (Old Jutlandic for “flaming-eyed”) are dreadful demons of smoke and flame, resembling 12’ tall iron-skinned minotaurs with fiery eyes and stunted black wings. Báleygr rejoice in war and bloodshed, and typically carry giant-sized weapons of black metal in each hand, favoring a sword, axe, or mace in one hand and a whip in the other.\n\nSome sages believe that the báleygr were once guardians of the Elemental Sphere of Fire, and that they were turned to darkness by Bel, called the Slaughterprince, the Chthonic god of battle. Others claim they are born of the hates and fears of men, and grow stronger as the world descends into chaos. Whatever their origins, báleygr are fearsome foes who bring ruin to any that stand against them.\n\nBáleygr are as intelligent as they are evil. All báleygr can speak Common and two other languages, often Ancient Zaharan and the local beastman dialect.\n\n###### Combat\n\nAt will, a báleygr can surround itself with an **aura of elemental fire** and/or **shrouding smoke**. When the báleygr’s aura of elemental fire is active, creatures within 15’ of the báleygr take 1d8 {F!} damage if they begin their initiative in its aura, or move into it on their initiative. When its aura of shrouding smoke is active, the báleygr is hidden by the smoke and any creatures (other than the báleygr) within 25’ of it are **blinded** unless able to discern invisible. The báleygr can have both auras active, if desired.\n\nA báleygr is **dreadful** to confront.A creature which starts its initiative, or moves within, 60’ of a báleygr must make a Paralysis saving throw. If the save succeeds, the creature gains immunity to the effects of every báleygr’s dreadfulness for 1 turn. If the save fails, the creature starts **faltering.** If the creature was already faltering, it becomes **frightened** instead. The faltering or frightened condition ends if removed magically or if the báleygr is destroyed or no longer within 60’. As a báleygr’s dreadful presence is preternatural, it functions even through the obscurement of its aura of shrouding smoke.\n\nIn melee, a báleygr will strike with one of its giant-sized weapons. Targets within 10’ can be attacked with its sword, axe, or mace for 4d6 {W!} damage. More distant targets, up to 30’, can be attacked with its whip for 2d6 {S!} damage. Targets struck by the báleygr’s whip must make successful size-adjusted Paralysis throws or be dragged adjacent to the báleygr.\n\nOccasionally báleygr arm themselves with huge bows, with which they shoot flaming arrows. Báleygr’s bows have twice the range of longbows and deal 4d6 {P!} {F!} damage on a successful attack. A báleygr can cleave with its bow without restriction from the weapon. All of a báleygr’s weapons melt into slag if the creature is slain.\n\nA báleygr has the spellcasting abilities of a 9th level mage with the following spells in its repertoire: 1st - *blinding flash, counterspell, kindle flame, weave smoke, tenebrosity*; 2nd – *battering ram, burning sparks, circling winds, discern invisible, shrouding fog*; 3rd – *boil blood, fireball, thunderbolt, weave fire*; 4th – *inferno, scouring zephyr, wall of flame*; 5th – *carnage, fire storm*.\n\nA báleygr is **immune** to death effects and to fire, necrotic, and poisonous damage. It is **resistant** to acidic, bludgeoning, cold, electricity, piercing, seismic, and slashing damage. It possesses **lightless vision** (90’) and **telepathy**, which allows it to communicate with any creatures it encounters. It can be held at bay by *holy circle*and rebuked by a divine caster as an infernal creature. If rebuked, however, it can make a Spells saving throw; if the save succeeds, the báleygr can ignore the effect and cannot be rebuked by that divine caster again.\n\nBáleygr are unholy beings that can be detected with *discern evil*, held at bay by *holy circle* and destroyed with *dispel evil.* If summoned, they can be returned to their home spheres by *counterspell* or *dispel magic*.\n\n###### Ecology\n\nBáleygr dwell in the bowels of the earth, in furnaces of elemental fire or sinkholes of evil. From time to time, dwarven engineers who delve too deep come upon these terrible creatures of smoke and flame.\n\nIf encountered in a wilderness lair, a legion of báleygr will be led by a **báleygr lord**. The lord has a 25% chance to be mounted on a winged drake-form red dragon of mature adult age.\n\n###### Spoils\n\nA destroyed báleygr can be harvested with Alchemy 2 for the following components useful in magic research:\n\n* black ashy remains (95 st, 5700gp, *cone of fear, inspire horror, panic, shrouding fog,* all fire elemental effects)\n\nThe black ashy remains of báleygr lords are even more valuable (141 4/6 st, 8500gp).\n\n###### Lore\n\n*When the war-drum was struck the twelfth time, the báleygr came forth. Smoke shrouded it, hot as forge-fire. Dreadful was its presence, and many men, once accounted among brave, faltered and fled at its approach.*\n\n*But Valerian Bellësareus was not afraid. The Lord of the Empyrean Host stepped into the smoky furnace, calling out to his warriors. “Be not afraid of the terror of darkness, for Ammonar shall illumine the way!” And his sword of fire held aloft was like a beacon-fire that guides ships to port in dark fog.*\n\n* Azendor, *Seven Radiant Scrolls,* Fourth Book of the Empyrean War\n\n#### Báleygr (Cont.)\n\n![](data:image/png;base64...)\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Báleygr Primary Characteristics** | |\n| **Type:** | Incarnation (demon) |\n| **Size:** | Huge (700 st.) |\n| **Speed (land):** | 40’ / 120’ |\n| **Armor Class:** | 10 |\n| **Hit Dice:** | 12\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* |\n| **Attacks:** | 1 (weapon or whip -1+) |\n| **Damage:** | 4d6 {W!} /2d6 {S! + drag |\n| **Save:** | F12 |\n| **Morale:** | +4 |\n| **Vision:** | Lightless Vision (90’) |\n| **Other Senses:** | Standard |\n| **Proficiencies:** | None |\n| **Normal Load:** | 90 st. |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Báleygr Secondary Characteristics** | |\n| **Expedition Speed:** | 24 miles |\n| **Supply Cost:** | None |\n| **Training Period:** | 1 month (sapient) |\n| **Training Modifier:** | None (sapient) |\n| **Battle Rating:** | 9.5 (individual), 185 (unit) |\n| **Lifespan:** | Indefinite |\n| **Reproduction:** | None |\n| **Untrained Value:** | 5,700gp (A) / - / - |\n| **Trained Value:** | 220,000gp (sapient) |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Báleygr Encounter Set-Up** | |\n| **Lair:** | 10% |\n| **Dungeon Enc:** | Solitary (1) / Fist (1d4) |\n| **Wilderness Enc:** | Fist (1d4) / Legion (2d4 Fists) |\n| **Alignment:** | Chaotic |\n| **Treasure Type:** | Q (per báleygr) |\n| **XP:** | 5,700 |\n\n![](data:image/png;base64...)\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Báleygr Lord Primary Characteristics** | |\n| **Type:** | Incarnation (demon) |\n| **Size:** | Huge (700 st.) |\n| **Speed (land):** | 40’ / 120’ |\n| **Armor Class:** | 12 |\n| **Hit Dice:** | 16\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* |\n| **Attacks:** | 1 (weapon or whip -5+) |\n| **Damage:** | 5d6 {W!} /3d6 {S!} + drag |\n| **Save:** | F16 |\n| **Morale:** | +4 |\n| **Vision:** | Lightless Vision (90’) |\n| **Other Senses:** | Standard |\n| **Proficiencies:** | None |\n| **Normal Load:** | 90 st. |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Báleygr Lord Secondary Characteristics** | |\n| **Expedition Speed:** | 24 miles |\n| **Supply Cost:** | None |\n| **Training Period:** | 1 month (sapient) |\n| **Training Modifier:** | None (sapient) |\n| **Battle Rating:** | 12 (individual), 245 (unit) |\n| **Lifespan:** | Indefinite |\n| **Reproduction:** | None |\n| **Untrained Value:** | 8,500gp (A) / - / - |\n| **Trained Value:** | 290,000gp (sapient) |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Báleygr Lord Encounter Set-Up** | |\n| **Lair:** | Special |\n| **Dungeon Enc:** | Special |\n| **Wilderness Enc:** | Special |\n| **Alignment:** | Neutral |\n| **Treasure Type:** | N, Q (per lord) |\n| **XP:** | 8,500 |\n\n",

All of a báleygr’s weapons melt into slag if the creature is slain.</p>\n<p>A báleygr has the spellcasting abilities of a 9th level mage with the following spells in its repertoire: 1st - <em>blinding flash, counterspell, kindle flame, weave smoke, tenebrosity</em>; 2nd – <em>battering ram, burning sparks, circling winds, discern invisible, shrouding fog</em>; 3rd – <em>boil blood, fireball, thunderbolt, weave fire</em>; 4th – <em>inferno, scouring zephyr, wall of flame</em>; 5th – <em>carnage, fire storm</em>.</p>\n<p>A báleygr is <strong>immune</strong> to death effects and to fire, necrotic, and poisonous damage. It is <strong>resistant</strong> to acidic, bludgeoning, cold, electricity, piercing, seismic, and slashing damage. It possesses <strong>lightless vision</strong> (90’) and <strong>telepathy</strong>, which allows it to communicate with any creatures it encounters. It can be held at bay by <em>holy circle</em>and rebuked by a divine caster as an infernal creature. If rebuked, however, it can make a Spells saving throw; if the save succeeds, the báleygr can ignore the effect and cannot be rebuked by that divine caster again.</p>\n<p>Báleygr are unholy beings that can be detected with <em>discern evil</em>, held at bay by <em>holy circle</em> and destroyed with <em>dispel evil.</em> If summoned, they can be returned to their home spheres by <em>counterspell</em> or <em>dispel magic</em>.</p>\n<h6>Ecology</h6>\n<p>Báleygr dwell in the bowels of the earth, in furnaces of elemental fire or sinkholes of evil. From time to time, dwarven engineers who delve too deep come upon these terrible creatures of smoke and flame.</p>\n<p>If encountered in a wilderness lair, a legion of báleygr will be led by a <strong>báleygr lord</strong>. The lord has a 25% chance to be mounted on a winged drake-form red dragon of mature adult age.</p>\n<h6>Spoils</h6>\n<p>A destroyed báleygr can be harvested with Alchemy 2 for the following components useful in magic research:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>black ashy remains (95 st, 5700gp, <em>cone of fear, inspire horror, panic, shrouding fog,</em> all fire elemental effects)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The black ashy remains of báleygr lords are even more valuable (141 4/6 st, 8500gp).</p>\n<h6>Lore</h6>\n<p><em>When the war-drum was struck the twelfth time, the báleygr came forth. Smoke shrouded it, hot as forge-fire. Dreadful was its presence, and many men, once accounted among brave, faltered and fled at its approach.</em></p>\n<p><em>But Valerian Bellësareus was not afraid. The Lord of the Empyrean Host stepped into the smoky furnace, calling out to his warriors. “Be not afraid of the terror of darkness, for Ammonar shall illumine the way!” And his sword of fire held aloft was like a beacon-fire that guides ships to port in dark fog.</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Azendor, <em>Seven Radiant Scrolls,</em> Fourth Book of the Empyrean War</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Báleygr (Cont.)</h4>\n<p><img src=\"data:image/png;base64...\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Báleygr Primary Characteristics</strong></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Type:</strong></td>\n<td>Incarnation (demon)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Size:</strong></td>\n<td>Huge (700 st.)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Speed (land):</strong></td>\n<td>40’ / 120’</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Armor Class:</strong></td>\n<td>10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Hit Dice:</strong></td>\n<td>12*****</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Attacks:</strong></td>\n<td>1 (weapon or whip -1+)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Damage:</strong></td>\n<td>4d6 {W!} /2d6 {S!
