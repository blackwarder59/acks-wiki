  "markdown": "### Giant, Stone\n\nGiants are mighty creatures that compare in stature to humans as humans compare to halflings. Unlike beastmen, ogres, and trolls, which were bred by the evil alchemy of the Zaharans, giants have existed since time immemorial, and not all giants are wicked. Some giants are more or less decent, and have even assisted adventurers from time to time in his various purposes. Most, however, are as cruel as they are stupid, and delight to eat the flesh of men.\n\nStone giants are 14’ tall and weigh about 3,000lb. They have stone-like complexions and iron grey eyes, with hair the color of dark stone. They dress in animal skins and favor carved clubs of granite and stalactite-like spears.\n\nGiants of all types share a bombastic language. Stone giants also speak Common, Meniri Dwarven. If they dwell near grimlocks, morlocks, or troglodytes they will speak those tongues as well.\n\n###### Combat\n\nIn combat, stone giants can smash with their fists or with weapons. When smashing with piercing or slashing weapons, giants deliver **vicious blows** that deal an additional 4 points per smash. When smashing with bludgeoning weapons, giants can **topple and fling** large or smaller creatures with every attack (p. XX). The creature struck must make a successful size-adjusted Paralysis saving throw or be knocked prone and forced back a number of feet equal to the damage dealt. The giant can cleave if the creature fails its save against his smash.\n\nInstead of smashing, stone giants can **hurl boulders** to a distance of 1200’, dealing 3d6 {B!} damage in a 5’ radius to the impact point. When hurling a boulder, a stone giant functions like a heavy ballista using the rules for Missile Attacks with Artillery (***ACKS II RR****,* p. XX). However, the giant does not need to reload, so it can throw a boulder each round if it has sufficient ammo. Stone giants are the **superior rock-throwers**, so they gain a +2 attack bonus when hurling rocks.\n\n###### Ecology\n\nStone giants dwell in the lower reaches of the Meniri Mountains. When stone giants are encountered in a dungeon lair or wilderness warband, they have a 25% chance to be accompanied by trained animals. When encountered in a wilderness lair, they are always accompanied by trained creatures. If trained creatures are present in a stone giant lair, roll 1d10 to determine type and number: 1-8, 5d6 cave gorillas; 9-10, 3d6 cave bears.\n\nAdventurers usually encounter small bands of stone giants who have made their way into civilized realms to raid and plunder. From time to time, stone giants have spoken of a “king below the stone” who rules vast tribes of stone giants deep below the Meniri Mountains, but no evidence of this wild assertion has ever surfaced.\n\n![](data:image/png;base64...)\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Stone Giant Primary Characteristics** | |\n| **Type:** | Giant |\n| **Size:** | Huge (300 st.) |\n| **Speed (land):** | 40’ / 120’ |\n| **Armor Class:** | 5 |\n| **Hit Dice:** | 9 |\n| **Attacks:** | 1 (smash 2+ or throw 0+) |\n| **Damage:** | 3d6 {W!} or 3d6 {B!} |\n| **Save:** | F9 |\n| **Morale:** | +1 |\n| **Vision:** | Lightless Vision (60’) |\n| **Other Senses:** | Standard |\n| **Proficiencies:** | None |\n| **Normal Load:** | 65 st. |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Stone Giant Secondary Characteristics** | |\n| **Expedition Speed:** | 24 miles |\n| **Supply Cost:** | 6gp |\n| **Training Period:** | 1 month (sapient) |\n| **Training Modifier:** | None (sapient) |\n| **Battle Rating:** | 1.007 (individual), 20 (unit) |\n| **Lifespan:** | 0/1.66/20/27/50/75/100/125 |\n| **Reproduction:** | 1 baby per 7 years |\n| **Untrained Value:** | 700gp(A)/130gp (J)/80gp(B) |\n| **Trained Value:** | 24,000gp |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Stone Giant Encounter Set-Up** | |\n| **Lair:** | 25% |\n| **Dungeon Enc:** | Gang (1d3) / Lair (1d6) |\n| **Wilderness Enc:** | Warband (1d6) / Lair (1d6) |\n| **Alignment:** | Neutral |\n| **Treasure Type:** | N |\n| **XP:** | 700 |\n\n###### Spoils\n\nA slain stone giant can be harvested with Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the following component:\n\n* pituitary gland (11 4/6 st, 700gp, *battering ram*, *sling stone*, armor +2, weapon +2\n\n",
