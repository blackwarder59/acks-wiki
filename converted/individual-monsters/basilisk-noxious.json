  "markdown": "### Basilisk, Noxious\n\nThe noxious basilisk, sometimes called the primordial basilisk, was created from spite and venom by Iskara, Mother of Monsters, during her terrible war with the gods. It resembles a reptilian monster with a dun-colored body and mustard-hued underbelly and a short, curved horn atop the nose. An adult basilisk’s body grows to about 10’ long and weighs 300 lbs.\n\n###### Combat\n\nNoxious basilisks have tough hides that are **resistant** to mundane bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.\n\nThe bite of a noxious basilisk carries a **paralytic venom**. Any creature damaged by a primordial basilisk’s bite must make a Death saving throw. If the save succeeds, the creature is not affected by the venom. If the save fails, then creature suffers 6d6 {Po!} damage and becomes **paralyzed** for 2d4 turns at the end of the basilisk’s initiative. The paralysis can be cured by *neutralize poison* but not *cure light injury.* When the paralysis wears off, the poisoned creature is **fatigued**. The fatigue ends if the poison is neutralized or after the creature enjoys 8 hours of restful sleep.\n\nIn lieu of biting, a noxious basilisk can breathe a noxious cloud 20’ in diameter. Any creature within the cloud’s area of effect must make a Death saving throw. The effects of the noxious cloud are identical to the paralytic bite. A noxious basilisk’s breath weapon can be used once every 1d3 rounds.\n\n###### Ecology\n\nNoxious basilisks often live in dense woods or dungeons. When noxious basilisks are encountered in a wilderness nest, there is a 10% chance per basilisk that it will be incubating 1d3 eggs. Basilisk eggs have 1 hp and weigh 2/6 st. Basilisk hatchlings are rarely found in nests, because the hatchlings immediately disperse into the wild after they emerge from their eggs.\n\n###### Spoils\n\nA slain noxious basilisk can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the following components useful in magic research:\n\n* eyes (8 2/6 st., 500gp, *cloud of poison, cone of paralysis, halt monster, hypnotic sigil*)\n* gizzard (8 2/6 st., 500gp, *cure injury, neutralize poison*)\n\nA noxious basilisk’s horn fetches 2d10gp and weighs 1 stone for every 80gp.\n\nBasilisks are difficult to train, but their powerful abilities allow them to command a premium.\n\n###### Lore\n\n*Horned basilisks appear as antagonists to the gods and heroes in the earliest recorded myths of the Argollëans, dating back to 3,500 BE. Smoothskull basilisks, however, are not attested in mythology until 2000 BE. From this, the sages of the Tower of Knowledge have surmised that the horned basilisk is the older of the two species, and probably was created before the Day Without Night.*\n\n* Toraster the Elder, *Bestiary of Aurëpos*\n\n. ![](data:image/png;base64...)\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Noxious Basilisk Primary Characteristics** | |\n| **Type:** | Monstrosity (bestial) |\n| **Size:** | Man-sized (30 st.) |\n| **Speed (land):** | 20’ / 60' |\n| **Armor Class:** | 5 |\n| **Hit Dice:** | 6 + 1 \\*\\* |\n| **Attacks:** | 1 (bite 4+) or breath |\n| **Damage:** | 1d10 {P!} + poison or paralysis |\n| **Save:** | F6 |\n| **Morale:** | +1 |\n| **Vision:** | Lightless Vision (60’), Night Vision |\n| **Other Senses:** | Standard |\n| **Proficiencies:** | None |\n| **Normal Load:** | 20 st. |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Noxious Basilisk Secondary Characteristics** | |\n| **Expedition Speed:** | 12 miles |\n| **Supply Cost:** | 2gp |\n| **Training Period:** | 6 months |\n| **Training Modifier:** | 0 |\n| **Battle Rating:** | 0.446 (individual), 53.5 (unit) |\n| **Lifespan:** | E/1.25/5/8.5/20/30/40/50 |\n| **Reproduction:** | 1d3 eggs every 6 years |\n| **Untrained Value:** | 2,475gp (A)/2,500gp (J)/1,700gp (E) |\n| **Trained Value:** | 9,225gp (hunter) |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Noxious Basilisk Encounter Set-Up** | |\n| **Lair:** | 40% |\n| **Dungeon Enc:** | Bask (1d6) / Nest (1d6) |\n| **Wilderness Enc:** | Bask (1d6) / Nest (1d6) |\n| **Alignment:** | Neutral |\n| **Treasure Type:** | P |\n| **XP:** | 980 |\n\n",
