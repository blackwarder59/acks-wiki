Throughout Aurëpos, they are held in awe and terror as living embodiments of avarice, gluttony, and wrath.\n\nDragons come in an astounding variety of body forms, colors, and powers. The Tower of Knowledge claims that dragons are elemental creatures whose very bodies adapt to whatever **habitat** they choose to lair in. Whatever the case, a dragon’s color and its breath weapon (if any) usually reflect the terrain and climate of their habitats, and dragons are often grouped into general categories on this basis. For instance, dragons that dwell in frigid tundra will often have white hides and freezing breath weapons, earning the name white dragons. See the Dragon Characteristics by Habitat table.\n\nDragons grow in power with **age**. A spawn will be no more powerful than a wolf, but a venerable dragon that has lived many centuries will possess titanic power. Many of a dragon’s characteristics primarily depend on its age, shown on the Dragon Characteristics by Age tables, below. To determine the age of a dragon randomly, roll 1d20! and multiply the result by 5. Determine the number of dragons encountered after determining the age. If two dragons are encountered, they will be a mated pair (if adult or older) or siblings (if juvenile or younger). If three or more dragons are encountered, they will be a mated pair (adults or older) along with their offspring. Determine the age of the offspring in years by rolling 1d10 x 5. Roll separately for treasure for each dragon by age.\n\nA dragon’s speed and attack routine are determined by its **body form**, while its damage per attack is determined by the intersection of its age and body form. A dragon’s natural weapons deal extraordinary damage regardless of its age. Dragons come in four basic body forms, each of which has winged and wingless variants, for a total of eight possibly body form configurations. To determine a dragon’s body form randomly, roll 1d12. 1 - wingless guivre; 2 – winged guivre; 3 – wingless lindworm; 4 – winged lindworm. 5 – wingless wyvern; 6 – winged wyvern; 7 – 9 – wingless drake; 10 – 12 – winged drake. See the Dragon Characteristics by Body Form table, below.\n\nAll dragons have one special ability derived from their body form and at least one other special ability. As they age, dragons become increasingly powerful and gain additional special abilities. Winged dragons gain **clutching claws** along with flight, but pick one less special ability to compensate. Refer to the Secondary Dragon Attributes table for the number of special abilities the dragon should receive.\n\nSome dragons are capable of speech. The older the dragon, the greater the probability that it has the capability of speech. Refer to the Dragon Characteristics by Rank table for the probability of speech. All dragons that can speak know Common, Draconic, and one other language per age category.\n\nDragons that can speak can also cast arcane spells at a caster level of ½ their HD. The arcane spells per day available is determined by the dragon’s age. Dragons always know the same number of arcane spells that they can cast per day. Their repertoire is innate and they have no need for spell formula or studying.\n\nDragons that can speak and cast spells should be counted as having one additional special ability (\\*) for purposes of XP. (This is already factored into the HD entry and XP awards for Ancient and Venerable dragons, which always can speak and cast spells). If dragons are always unintelligent creatures incapable of speech in the Judge’s campaign setting, then Ancient and Venerable dragons should be assigned an additional special ability instead.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Dragon Primary Characteristics** | |\n| **Type:** | Monstrosity (sapient) |\n| **Size:** | Varies by HD and Body Form |\n| **Speed (land):** | Varies by Body Form |\n| **Speed (fly):** | Varies by Body Form |\n| **Armor Class:** | Varies by Age and Body Form |\n| **Hit Dice:** | Varies by Age |\n| **Attacks:** | Varies by Body Form |\n| **Damage:** | Varies by Age and Body Form |\n| **Save:** | Varies by Age |\n| **Morale:** | Varies by Age |\n| **Vision:** | Acute Vision, Lightless Vision (90’) |\n| **Other Senses:** | Acute Hearing, Acute Olfaction |\n| **Proficiencies:** | None |\n| **Normal Load:** | Varies by Size |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Dragon Secondary Characteristics** | |\n| **Expedition Speed:** | Varies by Body Form |\n| **Supply Cost:** | Varies by Size |\n| **Training Period:** | 1 month (sapient) |\n| **Training Modifier:** | None (sapient) |\n| **Battle Rating:** | Varies |\n| **Lifespan:** | Indefinite |\n| **Reproduction:** | 1d4 eggs per lifetime |\n| **Trained Value:** | Varies by Age |\n| **Untrained Value:** | Varies by Age |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Dragon Encounter Set-Up** | |\n| **Lair:** | Varies by Age |\n| **Dungeon Enc:** | Varies by Age |\n| **Wilderness Enc:** | Varies by Age |\n| **Alignment:** | Usually Chaotic |\n| **Treasure Type:** | Varies by Age |\n| **XP:** | Varies by Age |\n\n###### Dragon Characteristics by Habitat\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Dragon Characteristics by Habitat | | | |\n| Habitat | Common Name | Hide Color | Breath Weapon |\n| Any sinkhole of evil | Wyrm | Purple taupe, liver, charcoal, or black | 40’ x 40’ cloud, fetid gas {N!} |\n| Any pinnacle of good | Metallic dragon | Bronze, silver, electrum, or gold | 90’ x 30’ cone, golden fire {L!} {F!} |\n| Clouds, mountain peaks | Blue dragon | Sky blue, slate grey, cloud white | 120’ x 5’ line, lightning bolt {E!} |\n| Deserts, wastelands | Brown dragon | Burnt orange, copper, or sandy brown | 90’ x 30’ cone, concussive blast {Se!} |\n| Oceans, lakes | Sea dragon | Sea green, teal, or cerulean blue | 90’ x 30’ cloud, blistering steam {F!} |\n| Glaciers, icy caves | White dragon | Ivory, pearl, or snow white | 90’ x 30’ cloud, freezing vapor {C!} |\n| Volcanoes, badlands | Red dragon | Flaming red, burnt orange, or charcoal | 90’ x 30’ cone, flame {F!} |\n| Woods, jungles | Green dragon | Moss green, olive, or forest green | 40’ x 40’ cloud, poison vapor {Po!| |\n| Swamps, marshes | Black dragon | Green-grey, midnight green, or black | 120’ x 5’, line, acid {A!} |\n\n###### Dragon Characteristics by Age\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Primary Characteristics by Age | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  | Normal | Chance of | Special | Spells per Day | | | | |\n| Age | Size | AC | HD | Save | ML | Load | Speech | Abilities\\* | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |\n| Spawn (1-5 years) | Large (40 st.) | 3 | 2\\*\\* | F2 | 0 | 8 st. | 1% | 1 ability | 1 | -

If wings are present, they are an addition to the body (giving it a total of six limbs). A drake has a speed of 90’ and, if winged, a flying speed of 240’. A drake’s attack routine consists of a pair of claw attacks and a bite attack. All drakes gain one **bonus** special ability from their body form. This body form is sometimes called “draconic” or “true dragon” form.\n\n**Guivre:** A guivre has a limbless body form resembling a serpent. If wings are present, they are an addition to the body. A guivre has a speed of 90’ and, if winged, a flying speed of 240’. A guivre’s attack routine consists of a bite and a tail attack. All guivres possess the **constriction** special ability.\n\n**Lindworm:**A lindworm has a legless body form with two front claws resembling a worm lizard. If wings are present, they are an addition to the body. (That is, a winged lindworm has two front claws and two wings on a legless body, for a total of four limbs. A serpentine body form with two wings and no other limbs is a winged guivre.) A lindworm has a speed of 60’ and a burrowing speed of 30’; if winged, it also has a flying speed of 180’. A lindworm’s attack routine consists of a single very powerful bite attack. All lindworms possess the **decapitating bite** special ability.\n\n**Wyverns:** A wyvern has a bipedal body form with two vestigial arms (like a tyrannosaur). If wings are present, they replace the arms (like a bat or bird). A wingless wyvern has a speed of 120’, while a winged wyvern has a speed of 90’ and a flying speed of 240’. A wyvern’s attack routine consists of either a bite and a tail attack and, if winged, two talon attacks. All wyverns possess the **poisonous bite/tail** special ability (Judge’s choice of whether the bite or tail is poisonous).\n\nIMAGE GOES HERE\n\nIMAGE GOES HERE\n\nIMAGE GOES HERE\n\nIMAGE GOES HERE\n\n###### Dragon Special Abilities\n\nSelect powers appropriate to the dragon’s habitat and alignment from the list below, or make up your own. Some abilities are noted as counting as only fractions of one of the dragon’s special abilities.\n\n**Breath Weapons:**The dragon gains a breath weapon appropriate to its habitat. See **Dragon Breath Weapons**, below.\n\n**Clutching Claws (1/2):**The dragon can make a **dive attack** with its claws (or talons). A dive attack inflicts double the normal damage dice. If the dragon hits a creature smaller than itself with both its claws or talons while making a dive attack, the creature must make a size-adjusted Paralysis saving throw. If the save fails, the creature is **grabbed**. Only winged dragons with claw/talon attacks can select this ability.\n\n**Constriction:**On a successful tail attack, the dragon **restrains** the creature struck if it is smaller than the dragon. The restrained creature cannot move, but can still attack, cast spells, take actions in lieu of attacking, or attempt to escape. It is **vulnerable** while restrained. On the dragon’s initiative each round thereafter, it can either release or squeeze the victim. If the dragon releases the victim, it can attack another creature with its tail instead. If the dragon squeezes the victim, the victim suffers additional damage as if struck by the dragon’s tail. A constricted victim can attempt to break out of the hold on its initiative as a combat action. Breaking out of the dragon’s hold requires a successful size-adjusted Paralysis throw. A dragon can squeezed a restrained creature even if casting a spell or taking another full-round action. Only dragons with tails can select this special ability.\n\n**Decapitating Bite:**Anytime the dragon’s bite attack succeeds on an unmodified roll of 20, the bite might decapitate its target. The creature bitten must make a Death saving throw. If the throw fails, the creature dies as its head is torn off and swallowed by the dragon. If the throw succeeds, the creature suffers quadruple dice of damage from the bite. If the dragon is gigantic, it can decapitate on 19-20; if colossal, on 18-20.\n\n**Draconic Persuasion***:* Some dragons have a dangerous charisma about them – their voices are inviting, cloying, seductive, their bearing commanding, their eyes penetrating. Any creature that speaks with such a dragon must make a Spells saving throw. If the save fails, the creature is **bewitched** (as per the spell *bewitch humanoid* if humanoid or *bewitch monster* otherwise). If the save succeeds, the creature is thereafter immune to that particular dragon’s draconic persuasion for 1 turn. Only dragons capable of speech may select this special ability.\n\n**Elemental Aura***:* The dragon is surrounded by an aura of elemental energy appropriate to its habitat (a red dragon might be wreathed in flame, for instance). The dragon can activate or deactivate the aura as an action in lieu of moving. While active, the aura has a radius of 1’ per HD, rounded up to the nearest 5’. Characters who begin their initiative within the aura, or enter it during their initiative, immediately suffer damage as if hit by a claw attack by a drake-form dragon of the radiating dragon’s age category. Only dragons with breath weapons can select this special ability.\n\n**Gem-Encrusted Hide:**Thedragon’s hide is coated with gemstones and coins from centuries of lying on its treasure pile. Because of this protection, it gains a +4 bonus to AC, but its land speed is reduced by 30’. The AC bonus increases to +5 when the dragon becomes Very Old, and +6 when the dragon becomes Venerable.\n\n**Horrific Stench:**The dragon gives off a disgusting stench. Characters who begin their initiative, or move on their initiative to, within 20’ of the dragon must make a Poison saving throw. The saving throw is at a -1 penalty if the dragon is Very Old, or -2 if Venerable. If the save fails, the creature becomes **queasy**.Queasy creatures suffer -3 to attack throws, proficiency throws, and damage rolls while in, and for 1d4+4 rounds after, leaving the dragon’s vicinity. If the save succeeds, the creature is thereafter immune to that particular dragon’s horrific stench for 1 turn.\n\n**Lightning Reflexes (1/4):** The dragon gains a +2 bonus to initiative rolls.\n\n**Massive Size:**The dragon is of enormous size for its age. Its Hit Dice are increased by 2, with a commensurate increase in damage from its claw and bite attacks and breath weapon. A dragon may take this special ability multiple times, representing a truly colossal specimen. Venerable dragons attack for 3d6/3d6/6d8 if this special ability is taken once and for 3d8/3d8/6d10 if the special ability is taken twice. See Legendary Dragons, below, for rules to create even larger dragons.\n\n**Invulnerable:**The dragon is immune to mundane damage.\n\n**Paralyzing Blows***:* Up to three of the dragon’s attacks can channel necrotic energy. Successful hits by these attacks cause the target to suffer **paralysis** for 3d4 turns unless it makes a successful Paralysis saving throw. If the dragon has only one attack in its attack routine, the saving throw is at a -2 penalty; if the dragon has two attacks in its attack routine, the saving throw is at -1. Only chaotic dragons can select this special ability.\n\n**Poisonous Blood:**Corrosive venom flows through the dragon’s veins. Any opponent that damages the dragon in melee must make a Death save to avoid being splashed with highly venomous blood. The saving throw is at a -1 penalty if the dragon is Very Old, or -2 if Venerable. If the save fails, the opponent dies. If the save succeeds, the creature is not affected.\n\n**Proficiency (1/8):** The dragon has a class proficiency appropriate to its powers and characteristics (Judge’s choice).\n\n**Resistant (1/2):** The dragon is resistant to mundane damage.\n\n**Stealthy (1/8)**: The dragon is difficult to notice. Characters encountering the dragon its natural habitat suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls.\n\n**Swallow Attack:**On an attack throw of an unmodified 20 against a target that is at least two size categories smaller than the dragon, the dragon can swallow it whole. Swallowed creatures suffer damage equal to a talon attack by a wyvern-form dragon of the dragon’s age category every round until they die, or until the monster is killed. If a dragon ever uses a breath weapon while one or more characters are within its belly, the swallowed character(s) take(s) full damage with no saving throw permitted. If the swallowed creature has a tiny, small, or natural piercing or slashing weapon, it can attack the dragon from inside its belly with an attack penalty of -4. Should a swallowed creature die and remain in a dragon’s belly for 6 turns, he has been irrecoverably digested. If the dragon is of gigantic size, it can swallow on 19-20; if of colossal size, on 18-20.\n\n**Swift (1/4):** The dragon moves rapidly. If wingless, its land encounter speed is increased by 30’ for every 120’ of encounter movement. If winged, its flight encounter speed is increased by 30’ for every 120’ of encounter speed. Its combat speed is adjusted by one-third the encounter speed adjustment.\n\n**Tail Lash:**The dragon can make one additional melee attack each round, lashing out with its tail at targets to its rear. When attacking with its tail lash, the dragon inflicts the tail damage of a guivre-form dragon of its own age category. Only lindworm- and drake-form dragons can select this special ability. (Guivre- and wyvern-form dragons already have tail attacks).\n\n**Terrifying Charge:**When the dragon completes a charge or dive attack, any creatures within 60’ must make a Paralysis saving throw. If the save fails, the creature becomes f**rightened**. If the save succeeds, the effect depends on the creature’s Hit Dice. If the creature has fewer than 2 HD, it still becomes frightened. If it has 2 HD or more, but ½ the dragon’s HD or less, the creature starts **faltering**. If it has HD equal to or greater than ½ the dragon’s HD, the creature is unaffected by terror. The terror continues until the dragon is slain or passes out of sight.\n\n**Trample (1/4)***:* The dragon can stomp on or slither over its an opponent, dealing damage through to its immense bulk. A trample attack occurs in lieu of a dragon’s normal attack routine. The trample attack inflicts the bite damage of a guivre-form dragon of its age category. When attacking with trample, the dragon gains a +4 bonus to its attack throw if the target is at least two sizes categories small than the dragon itself.. If the trample attack succeeds against such a creature, the creature must make a Paralysis saving throw at -6. If the save fails, the creature takes damage, then is forced aside 10’ (to a point left or right of the dragon), landing **prone**. If the saving throw succeeds, the creature takes damage but is not forced aside. A dragon can cleave after a successful trample attack that forces aside a creature.\n\n**Transformation:** The dragon can transform into another humanoid creature (as the spell *guise self*) or animal (as the spell *skinchange*) at will as an action in lieu of movement. In either case, it can ignore the ordinary constraints on size in those spells. The dragon does not gain any special abilities of the form, merely its physical characteristics, and cannot use its own special abilities while transformed except spellcasting. Only dragons capable of casting spells may select this special ability.\n\n**Venomous Bite or Tail:**The dragon’s bite or tails carries lethal poison. Any creature damaged by the dragon’s bite or tail must make a Death saving throw. The saving throw is at a -1 penalty if the dragon is Very Old, or -2 if Venerable. If the save fails, the creature instantly dies. If the save succeeds, the creature is not affected.\n\n**Wing / Arm Claws:**The dragon can make two additional melee attacks each round with the claws on its arms or wings. When attacking with its arms or wings, the dragon inflicts the claw damage of a drake-form dragon of its own age category. Winged guivre-, wingless lindworm-, wingless or winged wyvern-, and winged drake-form dragons can select this ability once. Winged lindworm-form dragons can select this ability twice (once for their arms and once for their wings). Wingless guivre- and wingless drake-form dragons cannot select this ability at all; the former have no claws, and the latter already attack with their foreclaws.\n\nEXAMPLE: Critothorax is a very old winged drake-form dragon. As a very old dragon, Critothorax has 3 special abilities. Because he has the drake body form, he gains one additional special ability. Because he is winged, he gains a flight speed and the **clutching claws** special ability, but loses one special ability. Therefore he has (3 + 1 – 1) = 3 special abilities. The Judge decides that Critothorax has the following special abilities: gem-encrusted hide, resistant, swift, and terrifying charge. Since resistant and swift each count as only half of a special ability, the tally adds up correctly.\n\n###### Dragon Breath Weapons\n\nDragons who select the **breath weapon** special ability are able to produce a powerful attack with a breath weapon. Though the classic breath weapon is the fire from a “fire-breathing dragon,” different dragons may breathe different kinds of effects based on their habitat.\n\nAll dragons' breath weapons deal 1d6 damage per Hit Die of the dragon. The damage type is determined by the type of breath, but is always extraordinary. Dragons with a breath weapon are immune to their own breath and to mundane damage of their breath type. They are resistant to extraordinary damage of their breath type.\n\nA dragon’s breath weapon can have one of three potential shapes: cloud shaped, cone shaped, and line shaped. All cloud-shaped breath effects occupy an area that is 20’ high, 40’ long, and 40’ wide. Cone-shaped effects begin with a width of 2’, and spread out into a cone shape 90’ long and 30’ wide. Line shaped breath weapons have the same 5’ width for their entire 120’ lengths. Each creature within the area of effect must make a Blast saving throws. If the save fails, the creature takes full damage from the breath and possibly suffers special effects (below). If the save succeeds, the creature takes only half damage and avoids any special effects.\n\nBreath weapons can either be limited-use or recharging. Limited-use breath weapons can be used 3 times per day. Recharging breath weapons can be used once every 1d6 rounds. If generating the dragon randomly, roll 1d6: 1-4 limited-use; 5-6 recharging.\n\nIn addition to damage, certain breath weapons have special effects, noted below:\n\n**Acid:**The acid stream can burn through wood and metal barriers to continue beyond them to its full length. The acid deals full structural damage to metal, wood, and cloth it touches, but cannot harm stone.\n\n**Fetid Gas:**Creatures that fail their Blast saving throws are afflicted by a noxious rotting disease which causes their body to deteriorate. They lose 1d4 points of STR, DEX, and CON each day until cured by a *cure disease*spell from a 9th level or higher cleric. If any of the character’s ability scores is reduced to 0, the character dies. Lost ability score points are recovered at a rate of 1 per day after the disease is cured.\n\n**Blistering Steam**, **Concussive Blast**, **Freezing Vapor**, **or Poison Vapor***:* For one round after the dragon breathes, the area of effect is partly obscured by the billowing vapors, steam, or dust. Attacks into or through the area suffer a -2 penalty. Characters who have Blind Fighting ignore this penalty.\n\n**Lightning Bolt:**The bolt damages objects in the area, dealing full damage to wood and one-tenth damage to stone. If the damage caused to an interposing barrier shatters or breaks through it, the bolt can continue beyond the barrier.\n\n**Fire:**Thefire ignites combustibles and damages objects in the area, dealing full damage to wood and one-tenth damage to stone. If the damage caused to an interposing barrier shatters or breaks through it, the breath can continue beyond the barrier in order to attain its full volume.\n\n###### Sleeping Dragons\n\nWhen a dragon is encountered in its lair, or otherwise in a location on the ground, there is a chance that the dragon will be asleep when stumbled across. Dragons are an ancient, long-lived race, and as such they operate on a different schedule than humanoids. Dragons may sleep in a safe location for days, weeks, or sometimes years if left undisturbed. However, despite sleeping more often, older, wiser dragons generally take precautions against being caught unawares. The percentage chance that a dragon will be caught asleep when found is provided on the Secondary Dragon Attributes table. If the dragon is found asleep, it is **surprised** in the first round of the encounter. The dragon will be roused after one round regardless of whether any attacks actually make contact, and combat will progress on the second round as normal.\n\n![](data:image/png;base64...)\n\n###### Dragon Interaction\n\nBecause of their long history, dragons seldom take notice of the lesser insignificant intelligent races, and view them as primitive upstarts. Nonetheless, dragons are extremely intelligent and value their own lives. To this end, dragons will bargain and even surrender to characters to save their lives or otherwise richly benefit. Dragons have immense egos, and even the most evil dragon may stop to listen to the pleas or praise of a soon to be lunch.\n\nDragons of differing alignment will interact with other intelligent creatures in different ways. Neutral dragons might or might not converse with characters, depending on the circumstances. Lawful dragons are more likely to aid a good party or a party on a noble mission. Chaotic dragons will likely attempt to destroy a party on sight unless there is something to be gained by exercising restraint.\n\n###### Dragon Eggs\n\nIf a mated pair of dragons without offspring is encountered in the dragons’ lair, the dragons will be incubating a clutch of 1d4 eggs. Dragon eggs fetch 600gp, weigh 8 st, and have 2 hp each. If properly incubated, dragon eggs will hatch into spawn after 1d4 x 12 months. The eggs must either be cared for by a dragon of adult age or older, or kept in a greater or supreme place of power. When born, each spawns’ body form will be identical to that of its same sex parent. All the spawn’s colors will be set by the environment in which they incubated.\n\n###### Dragon Components\n\nA slain dragon can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks). The components that can be harvested depend on the dragon’s age, color, and special abilities.\n\nDragon spawn can be harvested for a gizzard (2/6 st, 15gp, *call of the dragon, locate treasure*) and acomponent from their color list (2/6 st, 15gp, all effects associated with color).\n\nVery young dragons can be harvested for a gizzard (1 stone, 65gp, *call of the dragon, locate treasure*), acomponent from color list (1 stone, 65gp, all effects associated with color)and wingtips (1 stone, 65gp, *fly, winged flight,* *summon monstrosity).* A very young dragon has two horns, both of which fetch 2d3x10gp and weighs 1 st per 80gp, and an armored hide which fetches 50gp and weighs 4 st.\n\nYoung dragons can be harvested for a gizzard (3 3/6 st, 205gp, *call of the dragon, locate treasure),* a component from color list (3 3/6 st, 205gp, *all effects associated with color),* wingtips (3 3/6 st, 205gp, *flight, winged flight*), and front claws (3 3/6 st, 205gp, *swift strike*)*.* A young dragon has two horns, both of which fetch 2d6+1x5gp and weigh 1 st per 80gp, and an armored hide which fetches 100gp and weighs 8 4/6 st.\n\nJuvenile dragons can be harvested for a gizzard (5 2/6 st, 320gp, *call of the dragon, locate treasure),* a component from color list (5 2/6 st, 320gp, all effects associated with color)*,* wingtips (5 2/6 st, 320gp, *flight, winged flight*)*,* front claws (5 2/6 st, 320gp, *swift strike)* and fangs (5 2/6 st, 320gp, weapon +1*)*. A juvenile dragon has two horns, both of which fetch 2d6+1x10gp and weigh 1 1 st per 80gp, and an armored hide which fetches 125gp and weighs 16 st.\n\nAdult dragons can be harvested for a gizzard (8 stone, 480gp, *call of the dragon, locate treasure*)*,* a component from color list (8 stone, 480gp, all effects associated with color)*,* wingtips (8, 480gp, *flight, winged flight*)*,* front claws (8 stone, 480gp, *swift strike),* fangs (8 stone, 480gp, weapon +1) and a component from ability list (8 2/6 st, 500gp, all effects associated with special ability). An adult dragon has two horns, both of which fetch 3d8x10gp and weigh 1 stone for every 80gp, and an armored hide worth 400gp and weighing 24 stone.\n\nMature dragons can be harvested for a gizzard (9 stone, 540gp, *call of the dragon, locate treasure*), a component from color list (9 stone, 540gp, all effects associated with color*),* wingtips (9 stone, 540gp, *flight, winged flight*)*,* front claws (9 stone, 540gp, *swift strike*), fangs (9 stone, 540gp, weapon +1), a component from ability list (9 stone, 540gp, all effects associated with special ability), and dorsal scales (9 stone, 540gp, armor +1). A mature dragon has two horns, both of which fetch 1d3x100gp and weigh 1 stone for every 80gp. If its dorsal scales are not used for magic research, its armored hide fetches 100gp and weighs 35 st.\n\nOld dragons can be harvested for a gizzard (10 st, 600gp, *call of the dragon, locate treasure),* a component from color list (10 st, 600gp, all effects associated with color)*,* wingtips (10 st, 600gp, *flight, winged flight*)*,* front claws (10 st, 600gp, *swift strike*)*,* fangs (10 st, 600gp, weapon +1), a component from ability list (10 st, 600gp, all effects associated with special ability), dorsal scales (10 st, 600gp, armor +1), and a full set of teeth (10 st, 600gp, weapon +2). An old dragon has two horns, both of which fetch 1d10x50gp and weigh 1 stone. If its dorsal scales are not used for magic research, its armored hide fetches 1200gp and weighs 47 stone.\n\nVery old dragons can be harvested for a gizzard (13 2/6 st, 800gp, *call of the dragon, locate treasure),* a component from color list (13 2/6 st, 800gp, all effects associated with color)*,* wingtips (13 3/6 st, 800gp, *flight, winged flight*)*,* front claws (13 2/6 st, 800gp, *swift strike*),fangs (13 2/6 st, 800gp, weapon +1), dorsal scales (13 2/6 st, 800gp), a full set of teeth (13 2/6 st, 800gp,weapon +2), and two components from ability list (13 3/6 st each, 800gp each, all effects associated with special ability)*.* A very old dragon has two horns, both of which fetch 1d6x100gp and weigh. 1 stone for every 80gp. If its dorsal scales are not used for magic research, its armored hide fetches 2,250gp and weighs 60 st.\n\nAncient dragons can be harvested for a gizzard (14 stone, 840gp, *call of the dragon, locate treasure),* acomponent from color list (14 stone, 840gp, all effects associated with color)*,* wingtips (14 stone, 840gp, *flight, winged flight*)*,* front claws (14 stone, 840gp, *swift strike*),fangs (14 stone, 840gp, weapon +1), dorsal scales (14 stone, 840gp), a full set of teeth (14 stone, 840gp,weapon +2), two components from ability list (14 stone each, 840gp each, all effects associated with special ability), and a skull (14 stone, 840gp, armor +2)*..* An ancient dragon has two horns, both of which fetch 1d8x100gp and weighs 1 stone for every 80gp. If its dorsal scales are not used for magic research, its armored hide fetches 4,500gp and weighs 80 st.\n\nVenerable dragons can be harvested for a gizzard (19 stone, 1140gp, *call of the dragon, locate treasure),* acomponent from color list (19 stone, 1140gp, all effects associated with color)*,* wingtips (19 stone, 1140gp, *flight, winged flight*)*,* front claws (19 stone, 1140gp, *swift strike*),fangs (19 stone, 1140gp, weapon +1), dorsal scales (19 stone, 1140gp, armor +1), a full set of teeth (19 stone, 1140gp,weapon +2), three components from ability list (19 stone each, 1140gp each, all effects associated with special ability)*,* and a skull (19 stone, 1140gp, armor +2)*..* A venerable dragon has two horns, both of which fetch 1d10x100gp and weigh 1 stone per 80gp. If its dorsal scales are not used for magic research, its armored hide fetches 5,500gp and weighs 95 st.\n\nIf the dragon has two special abilities with the same component, the component’s value and weight are doubled and all effects applied.\n\nThe dragon components assume the body form is winged drake. If the dragon has another body form, the same components still exist but they are vestigial, e.g. a wingless guivre would have vestigial wingtips and front claws. Vestigial components retain their component value.\n\n**Dragon Components by Color**\n\n* Black - piceous gland (*rain of vitriol, vitriolic infusion, physical invulnerability – acidic*)\n* Blue - caesious gland (*lightning strike, thunderbolt, energy invulnerability – electrical*)\n* Brown - fuscous gland (*gale of wind, scouring zephyr, physical invulnerability – slash*)\n* Green - luteous gland (*cloud of poison, rain of vitriol, physical invulnerability – poisonous*)\n* Metallic - nacreous gland (*arrows of the sun, fireball, energy invulnerability – fire*)\n* Red - pyrrhous gland (*conflagration, fireball, energy invulnerability – fire*)\n* Sea - aqueous gland (*cone of frost, water breathing, energy invulnerability – cold*)\n* White - niveous gland (*cone of frost, wall of frost, energy invulnerability – cold*)\n* Wyrm - caseous gland (*cloud of poison, plague, energy invulnerability – necrotic)*\n\n**Dragon Components by Special Ability**\n\n* Clutching Claws – rear claws (*striking*)\n* Constriction – spine segments (*halt humanoid, iron maiden*)\n* Decapitating Bite – jawbone (*dismember, earth’s teeth*)\n* Draconic Persuasion – heart (*bewitch monster, dominate monster*)\n* Elemental Aura – secondary elemental gland (*wall of frost, wall of flame*)\n* Gem-Encrusted Hide – ventral scales (any protection effects)\n* Horrific Stench – lungs (*bloody flux,*\n* Invulnerability – ventral scales (any protection effects)\n* Massive Size – heart (*growth, vigor*)\n* Paralyzing Blows – horn (*halt monster*)\n* Poisonous Blood – blood (*neutralize poison, poison, vitriolic infusion*)\n* Swallow Whole – jawbone (*carnage, earth’s maw*)\n* Tail Lash – tail bone (*giant strength*)\n* Trample – spinal segments (*battering ram, force of impetus*)\n* Transformation - blood (*guise self*, *transform self*)\n* Terrifying Charge – heart (*cone of fear, panic*)\n* Venomous Bite – venom sacs (*neutralize poison, poison, vitriolic infusion*)\n* Wing/Arm Claws – wing claws (*swift strike*)\n\n###### Sea Dragons\n\nSea dragons have the ability to breathe underwater and swim at a rate of 240’ (80’). Sea dragons are almost always guivre-form.\n\nIf wingless they stay almost exclusively in the water. If winged, sea dragons may glide over the surface of water for up to 6 rounds (1 minute) before having to land. Sea dragons live in underwater caverns where they hoard treasure from sunken vessels. They will never be found asleep above water.\n\nA sea dragon with the **constriction** special ability can wrap its serpentine body around ships to deal structural damage each round. The shp dealt will be equal to the tail damage of a guivre-form dragon of one age category younger than itself.\n\n###### Legendary Dragons\n\nSome dragons are older than 700 years – much, much older – and they continue to grow with every passing year. For every full 700 years of additional age, the dragon gains two additional Hit Dice and +1 to AC. For every two additional HD, the dragon’s attack routine deals an additional 4 damage across its attacks. Legendary dragons sleep for decades or centuries at a time unless roused. They generally take precautions against being caught unawares by adventurers, though.\n\nEXAMPLE: Born before the Day Without Night, the dragon Chrios is 4,200 years old. (4,200 – 700) / 700 = 5. Chrios has +5 AC and +10 HD and deals an additional 20 points of damage with his attack routine. Chrios, a wyvern-form dragon, has AC 17, HD 30\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* and deals 8d6 per talon. His breath weapon deals 30d6 damage.\n\n",
  "html": "<h3>Dragon</h3>\n<p>Dragons are an ancient and dangerous reptilian species, capable of surviving for thousands of years, growing in size and power with each passing century. Throughout Aurëpos, they are held in awe and terror as living embodiments of avarice, gluttony, and wrath.</p>\n<p>Dragons come in an astounding variety of body forms, colors, and powers. The Tower of Knowledge claims that dragons are elemental creatures whose very bodies adapt to whatever <strong>habitat</strong> they choose to lair in. Whatever the case, a dragon’s color and its breath weapon (if any) usually reflect the terrain and climate of their habitats, and dragons are often grouped into general categories on this basis. For instance, dragons that dwell in frigid tundra will often have white hides and freezing breath weapons, earning the name white dragons. See the Dragon Characteristics by Habitat table.</p>\n<p>Dragons grow in power with <strong>age</strong>. A spawn will be no more powerful than a wolf, but a venerable dragon that has lived many centuries will possess titanic power. Many of a dragon’s characteristics primarily depend on its age, shown on the Dragon Characteristics by Age tables, below. To determine the age of a dragon randomly, roll 1d20! and multiply the result by 5. Determine the number of dragons encountered after determining the age. If two dragons are encountered, they will be a mated pair (if adult or older) or siblings (if juvenile or younger). If three or more dragons are encountered, they will be a mated pair (adults or older) along with their offspring. Determine the age of the offspring in years by rolling 1d10 x 5. Roll separately for treasure for each dragon by age.</p>\n<p>A dragon’s speed and attack routine are determined by its <strong>body form</strong>, while its damage per attack is determined by the intersection of its age and body form. A dragon’s natural weapons deal extraordinary damage regardless of its age. Dragons come in four basic body forms, each of which has winged and wingless variants, for a total of eight possibly body form configurations. To determine a dragon’s body form randomly, roll 1d12. 1 - wingless guivre; 2 – winged guivre; 3 – wingless lindworm; 4 – winged lindworm. 5 – wingless wyvern; 6 – winged wyvern; 7 – 9 – wingless drake; 10 – 12 – winged drake. See the Dragon Characteristics by Body Form table, below.</p>\n<p>All dragons have one special ability derived from their body form and at least one other special ability. As they age, dragons become increasingly powerful and gain additional special abilities. Winged dragons gain <strong>clutching claws</strong> along with flight, but pick one less special ability to compensate. Refer to the Secondary Dragon Attributes table for the number of special abilities the dragon should receive.</p>\n<p>Some dragons are capable of speech. The older the dragon, the greater the probability that it has the capability of speech. Refer to the Dragon Characteristics by Rank table for the probability of speech. All dragons that can speak know Common, Draconic, and one other language per age category.</p>\n<p>Dragons that can speak can also cast arcane spells at a caster level of ½ their HD. The arcane spells per day available is determined by the dragon’s age. Dragons always know the same number of arcane spells that they can cast per day. Their repertoire is innate and they have no need for spell formula or studying.</p>\n<p>Dragons that can speak and cast spells should be counted as having one additional special ability (*) for purposes of XP. (This is already factored into the HD entry and XP awards for Ancient and Venerable dragons, which always can speak and cast spells). If dragons are always unintelligent creatures incapable of speech in the Judge’s campaign setting, then Ancient and Venerable dragons should be assigned an additional special ability instead.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Dragon Primary

If wings are present, they are an addition to the body (giving it a total of six limbs). A drake has a speed of 90’ and, if winged, a flying speed of 240’. A drake’s attack routine consists of a pair of claw attacks and a bite attack. All drakes gain one <strong>bonus</strong> special ability from their body form. This body form is sometimes called “draconic” or “true dragon” form.</p>\n<p><strong>Guivre:</strong> A guivre has a limbless body form resembling a serpent. If wings are present, they are an addition to the body. A guivre has a speed of 90’ and, if winged, a flying speed of 240’. A guivre’s attack routine consists of a bite and a tail attack. All guivres possess the <strong>constriction</strong> special ability.</p>\n<p>**Lindworm:**A lindworm has a legless body form with two front claws resembling a worm lizard. If wings are present, they are an addition to the body. (That is, a winged lindworm has two front claws and two wings on a legless body, for a total of four limbs. A serpentine body form with two wings and no other limbs is a winged guivre.) A lindworm has a speed of 60’ and a burrowing speed of 30’; if winged, it also has a flying speed of 180’. A lindworm’s attack routine consists of a single very powerful bite attack. All lindworms possess the <strong>decapitating bite</strong> special ability.</p>\n<p><strong>Wyverns:</strong> A wyvern has a bipedal body form with two vestigial arms (like a tyrannosaur). If wings are present, they replace the arms (like a bat or bird). A wingless wyvern has a speed of 120’, while a winged wyvern has a speed of 90’ and a flying speed of 240’. A wyvern’s attack routine consists of either a bite and a tail attack and, if winged, two talon attacks. All wyverns possess the <strong>poisonous bite/tail</strong> special ability (Judge’s choice of whether the bite or tail is poisonous).</p>\n<p>IMAGE GOES HERE</p>\n<p>IMAGE GOES HERE</p>\n<p>IMAGE GOES HERE</p>\n<p>IMAGE GOES HERE</p>\n<h6>Dragon Special Abilities</h6>\n<p>Select powers appropriate to the dragon’s habitat and alignment from the list below, or make up your own. Some abilities are noted as counting as only fractions of one of the dragon’s special abilities.</p>\n<p>**Breath Weapons:**The dragon gains a breath weapon appropriate to its habitat. See <strong>Dragon Breath Weapons</strong>, below.</p>\n<p>**Clutching Claws (1/2):**The dragon can make a <strong>dive attack</strong> with its claws (or talons). A dive attack inflicts double the normal damage dice. If the dragon hits a creature smaller than itself with both its claws or talons while making a dive attack, the creature must make a size-adjusted Paralysis saving throw. If the save fails, the creature is <strong>grabbed</strong>. Only winged dragons with claw/talon attacks can select this ability.</p>\n<p>**Constriction:**On a successful tail attack, the dragon <strong>restrains</strong> the creature struck if it is smaller than the dragon. The restrained creature cannot move, but can still attack, cast spells, take actions in lieu of attacking, or attempt to escape. It is <strong>vulnerable</strong> while restrained. On the dragon’s initiative each round thereafter, it can either release or squeeze the victim. If the dragon releases the victim, it can attack another creature with its tail instead. If the dragon squeezes the victim, the victim suffers additional damage as if struck by the dragon’s tail. A constricted victim can attempt to break out of the hold on its initiative as a combat action. Breaking out of the dragon’s hold requires a successful size-adjusted Paralysis throw. A dragon can squeezed a restrained creature even if casting a spell or taking another full-round action. Only dragons with tails can select this special ability.</p>\n<p>**Decapitating Bite:**Anytime the dragon’s bite attack succeeds on an unmodified roll of 20, the bite might decapitate its target. The creature bitten must make a Death saving throw. If the throw fails, the creature dies as its head is torn off and swallowed by the dragon. If the throw succeeds, the creature suffers quadruple dice of damage from the bite. If the dragon is gigantic, it can decapitate on 19-20; if colossal, on 18-20.</p>\n<p><strong>Draconic Persuasion</strong><em>:</em> Some dragons have a dangerous charisma about them – their voices are inviting, cloying, seductive, their bearing commanding, their eyes penetrating. Any creature that speaks with such a dragon must make a Spells saving throw. If the save fails, the creature is <strong>bewitched</strong> (as per the spell <em>bewitch humanoid</em> if humanoid or <em>bewitch monster</em> otherwise). If the save succeeds, the creature is thereafter immune to that particular dragon’s draconic persuasion for 1 turn. Only dragons capable of speech may select this special ability.</p>\n<p><strong>Elemental Aura</strong><em>:</em> The dragon is surrounded by an aura of elemental energy appropriate to its habitat (a red dragon might be wreathed in flame, for instance). The dragon can activate or deactivate the aura as an action in lieu of moving. While active, the aura has a radius of 1’ per HD, rounded up to the nearest 5’. Characters who begin their initiative within the aura, or enter it during their initiative, immediately suffer damage as if hit by a claw attack by a drake-form dragon of the radiating dragon’s age category. Only dragons with breath weapons can select this special ability.</p>\n<p>**Gem-Encrusted Hide:**Thedragon’s hide is coated with gemstones and coins from centuries of lying on its treasure pile. Because of this protection, it gains a +4 bonus to AC, but its land speed is reduced by 30’. The AC bonus increases to +5 when the dragon becomes Very Old, and +6 when the dragon becomes Venerable.</p>\n<p>**Horrific Stench:**The dragon gives off a disgusting stench. Characters who begin their initiative, or move on their initiative to, within 20’ of the dragon must make a Poison saving throw. The saving throw is at a -1 penalty if the dragon is Very Old, or -2 if Venerable. If the save fails, the creature becomes <strong>queasy</strong>.Queasy creatures suffer -3 to attack throws, proficiency throws, and damage rolls while in, and for 1d4+4 rounds after, leaving the dragon’s vicinity. If the save succeeds, the creature is thereafter immune to that particular dragon’s horrific stench for 1 turn.</p>\n<p><strong>Lightning Reflexes (1/4):</strong> The dragon gains a +2 bonus to initiative rolls.</p>\n<p>**Massive Size:**The dragon is of enormous size for its age. Its Hit Dice are increased by 2, with a commensurate increase in damage from its claw and bite attacks and breath weapon. A dragon may take this special ability multiple times, representing a truly colossal specimen. Venerable dragons attack for 3d6/3d6/6d8 if this special ability is taken once and for 3d8/3d8/6d10 if the special ability is taken twice. See Legendary Dragons, below, for rules to create even larger dragons.</p>\n<p>**Invulnerable:**The dragon is immune to mundane damage.</p>\n<p><strong>Paralyzing Blows</strong><em>:</em> Up to three of the dragon’s attacks can channel necrotic energy. Successful hits by these attacks cause the target to suffer <strong>paralysis</strong> for 3d4 turns unless it makes a successful Paralysis saving throw. If the dragon has only one attack in its attack routine, the saving throw is at a -2 penalty; if the dragon has two attacks in its attack routine, the saving throw is at -1. Only chaotic dragons can select this special ability.</p>\n<p>**Poisonous Blood:**Corrosive venom flows through the dragon’s veins. Any opponent that damages the dragon in melee must make a Death save to avoid being splashed with highly venomous blood. The saving throw is at a -1 penalty if the dragon is Very Old, or -2 if Venerable. If the save fails, the opponent dies. If the save succeeds, the creature is not affected.</p>\n<p><strong>Proficiency (1/8):</strong> The dragon has a class proficiency appropriate to its powers and characteristics (Judge’s choice).</p>\n<p><strong>Resistant (1/2):</strong> The dragon is resistant to mundane damage.</p>\n<p><strong>Stealthy (1/8)</strong>: The dragon is difficult to notice. Characters encountering the dragon its natural habitat suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls.</p>\n<p>**Swallow Attack:**On an attack throw of an unmodified 20 against a target that is at least two size categories smaller than the dragon, the dragon can swallow it whole. Swallowed creatures suffer damage equal to a talon attack by a wyvern-form dragon of the dragon’s age category every round until they die, or until the monster is killed. If a dragon ever uses a breath weapon while one or more characters are within its belly, the swallowed character(s) take(s) full damage with no saving throw permitted. If the swallowed creature has a tiny, small, or natural piercing or slashing weapon, it can attack the dragon from inside its belly with an attack penalty of -4. Should a swallowed creature die and remain in a dragon’s belly for 6 turns, he has been irrecoverably digested. If the dragon is of gigantic size, it can swallow on 19-20; if of colossal size, on 18-20.</p>\n<p><strong>Swift (1/4):</strong> The dragon moves rapidly. If wingless, its land encounter speed is increased by 30’ for every 120’ of encounter movement. If winged, its flight encounter speed is increased by 30’ for every 120’ of encounter speed. Its combat speed is adjusted by one-third the encounter speed adjustment.</p>\n<p>**Tail Lash:**The dragon can make one additional melee attack each round, lashing out with its tail at targets to its rear. When attacking with its tail lash, the dragon inflicts the tail damage of a guivre-form dragon of its own age category. Only lindworm- and drake-form dragons can select this special ability. (Guivre- and wyvern-form dragons already have tail attacks).</p>\n<p><strong>Terrifying Charge:<strong>When the dragon completes a charge or dive attack, any creatures within 60’ must make a Paralysis saving throw. If the save fails, the creature becomes f</strong>rightened</strong>. If the save succeeds, the effect depends on the creature’s Hit Dice. If the creature has fewer than 2 HD, it still becomes frightened. If it has 2 HD or more, but ½ the dragon’s HD or less, the creature starts <strong>faltering</strong>. If it has HD equal to or greater than ½ the dragon’s HD, the creature is unaffected by terror. The terror continues until the dragon is slain or passes out of sight.</p>\n<p><strong>Trample (1/4)</strong><em>:</em> The dragon can stomp on or slither over its an opponent, dealing damage through to its immense bulk. A trample attack occurs in lieu of a dragon’s normal attack routine. The trample attack inflicts the bite damage of a guivre-form dragon of its age category. When attacking with trample, the dragon gains a +4 bonus to its attack throw if the target is at least two sizes categories small than the dragon itself.. If the trample attack succeeds against such a creature, the creature must make a Paralysis saving throw at -6. If the save fails, the creature takes damage, then is forced aside 10’ (to a point left or right of the dragon), landing <strong>prone</strong>. If the saving throw succeeds, the creature takes damage but is not forced aside. A dragon can cleave after a successful trample attack that forces aside a creature.</p>\n<p><strong>Transformation:</strong> The dragon can transform into another humanoid creature (as the spell <em>guise self</em>) or animal (as the spell <em>skinchange</em>) at will as an action in lieu of movement. In either case, it can ignore the ordinary constraints on size in those spells. The dragon does not gain any special abilities of the form, merely its physical characteristics, and cannot use its own special abilities while transformed except spellcasting. Only dragons capable of casting spells may select this special ability.</p>\n<p>**Venomous Bite or Tail:**The dragon’s bite or tails carries lethal poison. Any creature damaged by the dragon’s bite or tail must make a Death saving throw. The saving throw is at a -1 penalty if the dragon is Very Old, or -2 if Venerable. If the save fails, the creature instantly dies. If the save succeeds, the creature is not affected.</p>\n<p>**Wing / Arm Claws:**The dragon can make two additional melee attacks each round with the claws on its arms or wings. When attacking with its arms or wings, the dragon inflicts the claw damage of a drake-form dragon of its own age category. Winged guivre-, wingless lindworm-, wingless or winged wyvern-, and winged drake-form dragons can select this ability once. Winged lindworm-form dragons can select this ability twice (once for their arms and once for their wings). Wingless guivre- and wingless drake-form dragons cannot select this ability at all; the former have no claws, and the latter already attack with their foreclaws.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: Critothorax is a very old winged drake-form dragon. As a very old dragon, Critothorax has 3 special abilities. Because he has the drake body form, he gains one additional special ability. Because he is winged, he gains a flight speed and the <strong>clutching claws</strong> special ability, but loses one special ability. Therefore he has (3 + 1 – 1) = 3 special abilities. The Judge decides that Critothorax has the following special abilities: gem-encrusted hide, resistant, swift, and terrifying charge. Since resistant and swift each count as only half of a special ability, the tally adds up correctly.</p>\n<h6>Dragon Breath Weapons</h6>\n<p>Dragons who select the <strong>breath weapon</strong> special ability are able to produce a powerful attack with a breath weapon. Though the classic breath weapon is the fire from a “fire-breathing dragon,” different dragons may breathe different kinds of effects based on their habitat.</p>\n<p>All dragons&#39; breath weapons deal 1d6 damage per Hit Die of the dragon. The damage type is determined by the type of breath, but is always extraordinary. Dragons with a breath weapon are immune to their own breath and to mundane damage of their breath type. They are resistant to extraordinary damage of their breath type.</p>\n<p>A dragon’s breath weapon can have one of three potential shapes: cloud shaped, cone shaped, and line shaped. All cloud-shaped breath effects occupy an area that is 20’ high, 40’ long, and 40’ wide. Cone-shaped effects begin with a width of 2’, and spread out into a cone shape 90’ long and 30’ wide. Line shaped breath weapons have the same 5’ width for their entire 120’ lengths. Each creature within the area of effect must make a Blast saving throws. If the save fails, the creature takes full damage from the breath and possibly suffers special effects (below). If the save succeeds, the creature takes only half damage and avoids any special effects.</p>\n<p>Breath weapons can either be limited-use or recharging. Limited-use breath weapons can be used 3 times per day. Recharging breath weapons can be used once every 1d6 rounds. If generating the dragon randomly, roll 1d6: 1-4 limited-use; 5-6 recharging.</p>\n<p>In addition to damage, certain breath weapons have special effects, noted below:</p>\n<p>**Acid:**The acid stream can burn through wood and metal barriers to continue beyond them to its full length. The acid deals full structural damage to metal, wood, and cloth it touches, but cannot harm stone.</p>\n<p>**Fetid Gas:**Creatures that fail their Blast saving throws are afflicted by a noxious rotting disease which causes their body to deteriorate. They lose 1d4 points of STR, DEX, and CON each day until cured by a <em>cure disease</em>spell from a 9th level or higher cleric. If any of the character’s ability scores is reduced to 0, the character dies. Lost ability score points are recovered at a rate of 1 per day after the disease is cured.</p>\n<p><strong>Blistering Steam</strong>, <strong>Concussive Blast</strong>, <strong>Freezing Vapor</strong>, <strong>or Poison Vapor</strong><em>:</em> For one round after the dragon breathes, the area of effect is partly obscured by the billowing vapors, steam, or dust. Attacks into or through the area suffer a -2 penalty. Characters who have Blind Fighting ignore this penalty.</p>\n<p>**Lightning Bolt:**The bolt damages objects in the area, dealing full damage to wood and one-tenth damage to stone. If the damage caused to an interposing barrier shatters or breaks through it, the bolt can continue beyond the barrier.</p>\n<p>**Fire:**Thefire ignites combustibles and damages objects in the area, dealing full damage to wood and one-tenth damage to stone. If the damage caused to an interposing barrier shatters or breaks through it, the breath can continue beyond the barrier in order to attain its full volume.</p>\n<h6>Sleeping Dragons</h6>\n<p>When a dragon is encountered in its lair, or otherwise in a location on the ground, there is a chance that the dragon will be asleep when stumbled across. Dragons are an ancient, long-lived race, and as such they operate on a different schedule than humanoids. Dragons may sleep in a safe location for days, weeks, or sometimes years if left undisturbed. However, despite sleeping more often, older, wiser dragons generally take precautions against being caught unawares. The percentage chance that a dragon will be caught asleep when found is provided on the Secondary Dragon Attributes table. If the dragon is found asleep, it is <strong>surprised</strong> in the first round of the encounter. The dragon will be roused after one round regardless of whether any attacks actually make contact, and combat will progress on the second round as normal.</p>\n<p><img src=\"data:image/png;base64...\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h6>Dragon Interaction</h6>\n<p>Because of their long history, dragons seldom take notice of the lesser insignificant intelligent races, and view them as primitive upstarts. Nonetheless, dragons are extremely intelligent and value their own lives. To this end, dragons will bargain and even surrender to characters to save their lives or otherwise richly benefit. Dragons have immense egos, and even the most evil dragon may stop to listen to the pleas or praise of a soon to be lunch.</p>\n<p>Dragons of differing alignment will interact with other intelligent creatures in different ways. Neutral dragons might or might not converse with characters, depending on the circumstances. Lawful dragons are more likely to aid a good party or a party on a noble mission. Chaotic dragons will likely attempt to destroy a party on sight unless there is something to be gained by exercising restraint.</p>\n<h6>Dragon Eggs</h6>\n<p>If a mated pair of dragons without offspring is encountered in the dragons’ lair, the dragons will be incubating a clutch of 1d4 eggs. Dragon eggs fetch 600gp, weigh 8 st, and have 2 hp each. If properly incubated, dragon eggs will hatch into spawn after 1d4 x 12 months. The eggs must either be cared for by a dragon of adult age or older, or kept in a greater or supreme place of power. When born, each spawns’ body form will be identical to that of its same sex parent. All the spawn’s colors will be set by the environment in which they incubated.</p>\n<h6>Dragon Components</h6>\n<p>A slain dragon can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks). The components that can be harvested depend on the dragon’s age, color, and special abilities.</p>\n<p>Dragon spawn can be harvested for a gizzard (2/6 st, 15gp, <em>call of the dragon, locate treasure</em>) and acomponent from their color list (2/6 st, 15gp, all effects associated with color).</p>\n<p>Very young dragons can be harvested for a gizzard (1 stone, 65gp, <em>call of the dragon, locate treasure</em>), acomponent from color list (1 stone, 65gp, all effects associated with color)and wingtips (1 stone, 65gp, <em>fly, winged flight,</em> <em>summon monstrosity).</em> A very young dragon has two horns, both of which fetch 2d3x10gp and weighs 1 st per 80gp, and an armored hide which fetches 50gp and weighs 4 st.</p>\n<p>Young dragons can be harvested for a gizzard (3 3/6 st, 205gp, <em>call of the dragon, locate treasure),</em> a component from color list (3 3/6 st, 205gp, <em>all effects associated with color),</em> wingtips (3 3/6 st, 205gp, <em>flight, winged flight</em>), and front claws (3 3/6 st, 205gp, <em>swift strike</em>)<em>.</em> A young dragon has two horns, both of which fetch 2d6+1x5gp and weigh 1 st per 80gp, and an armored hide which fetches 100gp and weighs 8 4/6 st.</p>\n<p>Juvenile dragons can be harvested for a gizzard (5 2/6 st, 320gp, <em>call of the dragon, locate treasure),</em> a component from color list (5 2/6 st, 320gp, all effects associated with color)<em>,</em> wingtips (5 2/6 st, 320gp, <em>flight, winged flight</em>)<em>,</em> front claws (5 2/6 st, 320gp, <em>swift strike)</em> and fangs (5 2/6 st, 320gp, weapon +1*)*. A juvenile dragon has two horns, both of which fetch 2d6+1x10gp and weigh 1 1 st per 80gp, and an armored hide which fetches 125gp and weighs 16 st.</p>\n<p>Adult dragons can be harvested for a gizzard (8 stone, 480gp, <em>call of the dragon, locate treasure</em>)<em>,</em> a component from color list (8 stone, 480gp, all effects associated with color)<em>,</em> wingtips (8, 480gp, <em>flight, winged flight</em>)<em>,</em> front claws (8 stone, 480gp, <em>swift strike),</em> fangs (8 stone, 480gp, weapon +1) and a component from ability list (8 2/6 st, 500gp, all effects associated with special ability). An adult dragon has two horns, both of which fetch 3d8x10gp and weigh 1 stone for every 80gp, and an armored hide worth 400gp and weighing 24 stone.</p>\n<p>Mature dragons can be harvested for a gizzard (9 stone, 540gp, <em>call of the dragon, locate treasure</em>), a component from color list (9 stone, 540gp, all effects associated with color*),* wingtips (9 stone, 540gp, <em>flight, winged flight</em>)<em>,</em> front claws (9 stone, 540gp, <em>swift strike</em>), fangs (9 stone, 540gp, weapon +1), a component from ability list (9 stone, 540gp, all effects associated with special ability), and dorsal scales (9 stone, 540gp, armor +1). A mature dragon has two horns, both of which fetch 1d3x100gp and weigh 1 stone for every 80gp. If its dorsal scales are not used for magic research, its armored hide fetches 100gp and weighs 35 st.</p>\n<p>Old dragons can be harvested for a gizzard (10 st, 600gp, <em>call of the dragon, locate treasure),</em> a component from color list (10 st, 600gp, all effects associated with color)<em>,</em> wingtips (10 st, 600gp, <em>flight, winged flight</em>)<em>,</em> front claws (10 st, 600gp, <em>swift strike</em>)<em>,</em> fangs (10 st, 600gp, weapon +1), a component from ability list (10 st, 600gp, all effects associated with special ability), dorsal scales (10 st, 600gp, armor +1), and a full set of teeth (10 st, 600gp, weapon +2). An old dragon has two horns, both of which fetch 1d10x50gp and weigh 1 stone. If its dorsal scales are not used for magic research, its armored hide fetches 1200gp and weighs 47 stone.</p>\n<p>Very old dragons can be harvested for a gizzard (13 2/6 st, 800gp, <em>call of the dragon, locate treasure),</em> a component from color list (13 2/6 st, 800gp, all effects associated with color)<em>,</em> wingtips (13 3/6 st, 800gp, <em>flight, winged flight</em>)<em>,</em> front claws (13 2/6 st, 800gp, <em>swift strike</em>),fangs (13 2/6 st, 800gp, weapon +1), dorsal scales (13 2/6 st, 800gp), a full set of teeth (13 2/6 st, 800gp,weapon +2), and two components from ability list (13 3/6 st each, 800gp each, all effects associated with special ability)<em>.</em> A very old dragon has two horns, both of which fetch 1d6x100gp and weigh. 1 stone for every 80gp. If its dorsal scales are not used for magic research, its armored hide fetches 2,250gp and weighs 60 st.</p>\n<p>Ancient dragons can be harvested for a gizzard (14 stone, 840gp, <em>call of the dragon, locate treasure),</em> acomponent from color list (14 stone, 840gp, all effects associated with color)<em>,</em> wingtips (14 stone, 840gp, <em>flight, winged flight</em>)<em>,</em> front claws (14 stone, 840gp, <em>swift strike</em>),fangs (14 stone, 840gp, weapon +1), dorsal scales (14 stone, 840gp), a full set of teeth (14 stone, 840gp,weapon +2), two components from ability list (14 stone each, 840gp each, all effects associated with special ability), and a skull (14 stone, 840gp, armor +2)<em>..</em> An ancient dragon has two horns, both of which fetch 1d8x100gp and weighs 1 stone for every 80gp.

If its dorsal scales are not used for magic research, its armored hide fetches 5,500gp and weighs 95 st.</p>\n<p>If the dragon has two special abilities with the same component, the component’s value and weight are doubled and all effects applied.</p>\n<p>The dragon components assume the body form is winged drake. If the dragon has another body form, the same components still exist but they are vestigial, e.g. a wingless guivre would have vestigial wingtips and front claws. Vestigial components retain their component value.</p>\n<p><strong>Dragon Components by Color</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Black - piceous gland (<em>rain of vitriol, vitriolic infusion, physical invulnerability – acidic</em>)</li>\n<li>Blue - caesious gland (<em>lightning strike, thunderbolt, energy invulnerability – electrical</em>)</li>\n<li>Brown - fuscous gland (<em>gale of wind, scouring zephyr, physical invulnerability – slash</em>)</li>\n<li>Green - luteous gland (<em>cloud of poison, rain of vitriol, physical invulnerability – poisonous</em>)</li>\n<li>Metallic - nacreous gland (<em>arrows of the sun, fireball, energy invulnerability – fire</em>)</li>\n<li>Red - pyrrhous gland (<em>conflagration, fireball, energy invulnerability – fire</em>)</li>\n<li>Sea - aqueous gland (<em>cone of frost, water breathing, energy invulnerability – cold</em>)</li>\n<li>White - niveous gland (<em>cone of frost, wall of frost, energy invulnerability – cold</em>)</li>\n<li>Wyrm - caseous gland (<em>cloud of poison, plague, energy invulnerability – necrotic)</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Dragon Components by Special Ability</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Clutching Claws – rear claws (<em>striking</em>)</li>\n<li>Constriction – spine segments (<em>halt humanoid, iron maiden</em>)</li>\n<li>Decapitating Bite – jawbone (<em>dismember, earth’s teeth</em>)</li>\n<li>Draconic Persuasion – heart (<em>bewitch monster, dominate monster</em>)</li>\n<li>Elemental Aura – secondary elemental gland (<em>wall of frost, wall of flame</em>)</li>\n<li>Gem-Encrusted Hide – ventral scales (any protection effects)</li>\n<li>Horrific Stench – lungs (<em>bloody flux,</em></li>\n<li>Invulnerability – ventral scales (any protection effects)</li>\n<li>Massive Size – heart (<em>growth, vigor</em>)</li>\n<li>Paralyzing Blows – horn (<em>halt monster</em>)</li>\n<li>Poisonous Blood – blood (<em>neutralize poison, poison, vitriolic infusion</em>)</li>\n<li>Swallow Whole – jawbone (<em>carnage, earth’s maw</em>)</li>\n<li>Tail Lash – tail bone (<em>giant strength</em>)</li>\n<li>Trample – spinal segments (<em>battering ram, force of impetus</em>)</li>\n<li>Transformation - blood (<em>guise self</em>, <em>transform self</em>)</li>\n<li>Terrifying Charge – heart (<em>cone of fear, panic</em>)</li>\n<li>Venomous Bite – venom sacs (<em>neutralize poison, poison, vitriolic infusion</em>)</li>\n<li>Wing/Arm Claws – wing claws (<em>swift strike</em>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h6>Sea Dragons</h6>\n<p>Sea dragons have the ability to breathe underwater and swim at a rate of 240’ (80’). Sea dragons are almost always guivre-form.</p>\n<p>If wingless they stay almost exclusively in the water. If winged, sea dragons may glide over the surface of water for up to 6 rounds (1 minute) before having to land. Sea dragons live in underwater caverns where they hoard treasure from sunken vessels. They will never be found asleep above water.</p>\n<p>A sea dragon with the <strong>constriction</strong> special ability can wrap its serpentine body around ships to deal structural damage each round. The shp dealt will be equal to the tail damage of a guivre-form dragon of one age category younger than itself.</p>\n<h6>Legendary Dragons</h6>\n<p>Some dragons are older than 700 years – much, much older – and they continue to grow with every passing year. For every full 700 years of additional age, the dragon gains two additional Hit Dice and +1 to AC. For every two additional HD, the dragon’s attack routine deals an additional 4 damage across its attacks. Legendary dragons sleep for decades or centuries at a time unless roused. They generally take precautions against being caught unawares by adventurers, though.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: Born before the Day Without Night, the dragon Chrios is 4,200 years old. (4,200 – 700) / 700 = 5. Chrios has +5 AC and +10 HD and deals an additional 20 points of damage with his attack routine. Chrios, a wyvern-form dragon, has AC 17, HD 30****** and deals 8d6 per talon. His breath weapon deals 30d6 damage.</p>\n",
