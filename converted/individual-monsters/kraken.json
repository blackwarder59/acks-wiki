  "markdown": "### Kraken\n\nKraken were created by Lammala, the chthonic goddess of the abyssal depths, in time immemorial. The scourge of the deep, kraken are squid of truly colossal size. Their bodies and mantles reach lengths of 60’, with their cruelly-barbed tentacles, 2 large and 8 smaller, double this length. They weigh as much as 10,000 lbs (5 tons).\n\nThese monstrous beasts take cephalopod intellect to its animal extreme, and while not fully sapient, are nonetheless cunning predators, and will freely attack and devour smaller whales, sharks, giant squids, and other oceanic denizens, as well as boats, sometimes snatching unsuspecting sailors from atop the decks of their vessels.\n\nSome adventurers claim there are kraken lurking in the oceans that have achieved true sapience and serve as cephalopodic tyrants over lesser aquatic creatures. The most learned sages of the Tower of Knowledge consider this unlikely, however.\n\n###### Combat\n\nKrakens have **acute vision** and **acute olfaction** granting them a +2 bonus to avoid surprise in their native habitat. Their fluid-filled statocysts grant them **aquatic mechanoreception** that enables them to “see” underwater to a range of 270’ (p. XX).\n\nA kraken can attack from up to 90’ away with its tentacles. A kraken’s large tentacles can attack vessels or creatures of huge size or larger. Its smaller tentacles can attack vessels or creatures of any size within reach. As a colossal creature, a kraken deals full structural damage to vessels.\n\nA successful hit with a large tentacle deals 2d20 {B!} damage and **restrains** the creature or vessel. A successful hit with a small tentacles deals 2d12 {B!} damage and, if it struck a creature, **restrains** the creature. Small tentacles cannot restrain vessels.\n\nWhile a creature or vessel is restrained by a large tentacle, the kraken can automatically deal 2d20 {B!} (large tentacle) or 2d12 {B!} (small tentacle) on its initiative each round to the restrained vessel or creature without having to make an attack throw. Doing so counts as the kraken’s attack with that tentacle.\n\nA restrained creature cannot move but can still attack, cast spells, take actions in lieu of attacking, or attempt to escape. A restrained vessel cannot move, ram, or steer, but any crew can continue to act normally. A creature can escape by breaking free, slipping free, or cutting off the tentacle, but a vessel can only escape from restraint if the tentacle(s) restraining it are cut off. The normal rules of the restrained condition (p. XX) otherwise apply.\n\nTo cut off a large tentacle, an attack must deal 50 or more slashing damage to it in one blow. To cut off a small tentacle, an attack must deal 30 or more slashing damage to it in one blow. Any damage dealt beyond the required amount is not dealt to the kraken (the tentacle was severed).\n\nIn addition to attacking with its tentacles, a kraken can also attack with its great beak for 3d20 {P!} damage. If it is restraining a vessel, it can attack the vessel. Otherwise, it can attack a creature that is within 5’ of its beak.\n\nIf a kraken succeeds on a bite attack against a creature of huge size or less with an unmodified throw of 18 - 20, it can **swallow** the creature. The swallowed creature suffers 3d20 {A!} damage at the start of its initiative each round and drowns after 10 rounds. If the swallowed creature has a tiny, small, or natural piercing or slashing weapon, it can attack the kraken from inside its belly with an attack penalty of -4.\n\nShould a swallowed creature die and remain in the kraken’s belly for 6 turns, it is irrecoverably digested. The kraken can cleave after swallowing a creature.\n\nOnce per day, a kraken can use its combat action to create a 180' radius **cloud of black ink** around itself. It typically uses this to obscure itself long enough to flee from a losing encounter. The ink has the effect of a *tenebrosity* spell but it disperses into the water after 1 turn.\n\n###### Ecology\n\nKraken roam the oceans in search of prey, for their great bulk demands they feed constantly. They make their lairs in the abyssal depths, often near coral reefs, shipwrecks, or other underwater structures where they can lurk unseen and, more importantly, deposit their eggs in hidden places.\n\nThey reproduce only once in their lifetime and intensively care for their offspring. The female deposits a gelatinous egg mass in a hidden place, and then stays with the mass until the eggs hatch. When a kraken is encountered in its lair, there is a 15% chance it will be guarding one egg mass. Giant kraken egg masses have 5 hp and weigh 25 st.\n\n###### Spoils\n\nBecause of their propensity to swallow creatures whole, an encounter with a kraken may yield treasure even if the creature is encountered outside its lair. Such treasure (if any) is found inside the creatures’ bellies.\n\nA slain kraken can be harvested with Animal Husbandry or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the following components useful in magic research:\n\n* beak (66 4/6 st., 4000gp, *circle of agony,* weapon +5)\n* ink sac (66 4/6 st., 4000gp, *shrouding fog, tenebrosity*)\n* small tentacle (66 4/6 st., 4000gp, *choking grip, sunder structure*)\n* large tentacle (70 5/6 st., 4250gp, *cataclysm,* any water elemental effect)\n\nIf not used for magic research, a kraken’s beak fetches 60gp and weighs 1 st. A kraken’s ink sac fetches 3,600gp and weighs 4 st.\n\n###### Encounter\n\nFor leagues, the sea has been aquamarine green, the shallow water the color of the sea floor below. Ahead, however, lies a great disk of midnight blue water, almost 1000’ wide – a giant submarine sinkhole where the sea floor falls away into a chasm more than 700’ deep.\n\nA successful Loremastery or Knowledge (history) proficiency throw recalls that the *Leontophoros*, a Nicean royal galley, is reputed to have sunk in a “great blue hole in the sea” in this stretch of waters.\n\nThe treasure-filled wreck of the *Leontophoros* does rest at the floor of the sinkhole, alongside scores of other shipwrecks. All of these vessels were sunk by the immense **kraken** which lairs on the bottom of the blue hole. The kraken will attack any ships which sail across the blue hole, or which linger at its perimeter.\n\n**Kraken:** Con 16; Spd 180’ swim, AC 3, HD 36\\*\\*, hp 220, #AT 9 (2 large tentacles, 8 small tentacles, 1 bite -10+), Dmg 2d20 {B!} + restraint / 2d12 {B!} + restraint /3d20 {P!} + swallow whole, Save F15, ML 0, AL N, XP 18,350; Special: restrain creatures (2d12 ongoing, deal 30hp in one blow to cut off), restrain ships (2d20 shp ongoing, deal 50 hp in one blow to cut off), swallow whole (target swallowed if attack throw beats target value by 4+ or on unmodified 20, suffers 3d20 ongoing, may attack from within at -4, drowns in 10 rounds)\n\nIf the kraken is slain or driven off, the treasures on the sea-floor can be dredged to the surface.

(The remnants of other treasures are visible throughout the wreckage, but have been irreparably ruined by algae and salt water.) The kraken’s small tentacles (4,000gp, 66 4/6 st), large tentacles (4,250gp, 70 5/6 st), ink sac (4,000gp, 66 4/6 st), and stomach (4,000gp, 66 4/6 st) are valuable as special components.\n\nThe blue hole within which the kraken dwells is an *azure well of elemental water.* Spellcasters who cast water spells here calculate the spell effects as if they were two class levels higher than their actual level of experience. Characters performing magical research related to water spells in an azure well gain a +1 bonus to their magic research throws. If the azure wall is unoccupied, there is a 10% chance every 1d12 days that a water elemental (1 elemental or 1 marid) will manifest there.\n\n![](data:image/png;base64...)\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Kraken Primary Characteristics** | |\n| **Type:** | Monstrosity (bestial) |\n| **Size:** | Colossal (1,000 st.) |\n| **Speed (swim):** | 60’ / 180’ |\n| **Armor Class:** | 3 |\n| **Hit Dice:** | 36\\*\\* |\n| **Attacks:** | 11 (2 large tentacles, 8 small tentacles, bite -10+) |\n| **Damage:** | 2d20 {B!} + restraint per large / 2d12 {B!} + restraint per small / 3d20 {P!} |\n| **Save:** | F15 |\n| **Morale:** | 0 |\n| **Vision:** | Acute Vision, Lightless Vision (120’) |\n| **Other Senses:** | Acute Olfaction, Aquatic mechanoreception (270’) |\n| **Proficiencies:** | None |\n| **Normal Load:** | 330 st or 33 st per tentacle |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Kraken Secondary Characteristics** | |\n| **Expedition Speed:** | 36 miles (water) |\n| **Supply Cost:** | 480gp (carnivorous) |\n| **Training Period:** | 12 months |\n| **Training Modifier:** | +3 (semi-sapient) |\n| **Battle Rating:** | 4.258 (individual), 4.5 (unit) |\n| **Lifespan:** | E/8/16/32/64/96/128/160 |\n| **Reproduction:** | One egg mass per lifetime |\n| **Untrained Value:** | 80,000gp (A)/7,800gp (J)/625gp (E) |\n| **Trained Value:** | 100,000gp (guard) |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Kraken Encounter Set-Up** | |\n| **Lair:** | 10% |\n| **Dungeon Enc:** | None |\n| **Wilderness Enc:** | Solitary (1) / Den (1) |\n| **Alignment:** | Neutral |\n| **Treasure Type:** | F, I, K, M, P |\n| **XP:** | 18,350 |\n\n",
