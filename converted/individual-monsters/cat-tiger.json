  "markdown": "### Cat, Tiger\n\nTigers are the most powerful of all large cats. They roam the woodlands of Somirea, the jungles of Ulruk, and the cold northern forests of the Jutting Mountains. Most tigers avoid humans, but from time to time a beast will taste the blood of men and become a man-killer, thereafter hunting humans in preference to all other prey.\n\n###### Combat\n\nTigers have **acute hearing** and **acute olfaction.** They gain a +2 bonus to avoid surprise in their natural habitat. They can track the scent of creatures for up to 4 miles with the equivalent of two ranks of Tracking proficiency.\n\nThey are **quite agile** (as Acrobatics proficiency at 12+) and **good climbers**, able to ascend sheer surfaces as if they were thieves (5+). They are also **adept at swimming** (as Swimming proficiency). Their **lightning reflexes** grant a +1 bonus to initiative. They are **naturally stealthy** when in their native habitat, and creatures encountering them suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls.\n\nIf a tiger charges a creature or leaps over it (using Acrobatics), and successfully hits it with both claws, it immediately **pounces** onthe creature. The tiger’s subsequent bite attack automatically hits and the creature that has been pounced on must make a successful size-adjusted Paralysis saving throw or be knocked **prone**.\n\n###### Ecology\n\nWhen tigers are encountered in a wilderness den, there is a 50% chance the tigers will be rearing tiger cubs. Roll 1d4 for age and number; 1-2 it’s 1d2 juvenile tigers, 3-4 it’s 1d4 baby tigers. Juvenile tigers have AC 1, Spd 120’, HD 3, and attack with 2 claws (1d2 {S}) and a bite (1d6 {P}). Baby tigers have AC 0, Spd 120’, HD 2, and attack with 2 scratches (1 {S}) and a bite (1d2 {P}).\n\n###### Spoils\n\nA slain tiger with exceptional attributes can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following components useful in magic research:\n\n* heart (2 4/6 st, 160gp, *silent step, swift sword,* weapon +1)\n* tongue (2 4/6 st, 160gp, *call of the great cats*)\n\nA tiger's pelt fetches 75gp and weighs 1 2/6 st.\n\n###### Encounter\n\nA **tiger** has made a den out of several bushes covered by a dense umbrage of trees above.
