Their iridescent chitin is highly prized for its durability and glittering coloration.\n\nThey are mostly found in or near ponds, lakes, marshes, and rivers, but sometimes can be found in settled fields and gardens near water sources. Though beautiful, they are ferocious predators that hunt warm-blooded creatures and can be a menace to livestock. They sometimes even get a taste for human flesh.\n\n###### Combat\n\nGiant dragonflies have **acute hearing**, **olfaction**, and **vision.** They gain a +3 bonus to avoid surprise in their natural habitat.\n\nTheir **aerial mechanoreception** enables them to “see” up to 1350’ by sensing changes in air pressure. Spells or effects that would ordinarily cause blindness do not affect the dragonfly while it is using aerial mechanoreception. However, constructs, plants, oozes, and undead that remain motionless are invisible to the sense.
