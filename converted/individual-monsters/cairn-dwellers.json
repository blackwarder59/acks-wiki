To guarantee the victory of its invading legion, Y’chal blessed the cairn dwellers with immortal invulnerability. Whether it be burned to the bone, chopped into pieces or torn limb from limb, a cairn dweller simply cannot die.\n\nDefeated and broken in long-forgotten battles, the cairn dwellers have come to fear the agony of their unceasing lives more than anything else. Now they try to trick the gods of Cybele into letting them them die so their souls can be reformed into new life. To this end, they take up residence in tumuli and barrows, leaving only to feed and to find material for the crude copies they make of the grave goods they discover within their sepulchral homes - false offerings they hope will please their unhearing saviors.\n\nWhen not arranging and rearranging their worthless cult-objects - losing track of the real treasures amid their false ones - they often lay in the sarcophagus of the honored dead, draping themselves in burial shrouds or wearing the waxen death masks of the those whose resting places they defile.\n\nNearly every cairn dweller is both cowardly and insane.\n\n###### Combat\n\nAll cairn dwellers are protected by permanent *necromantic invulnerability* (as the spell). In addition, cairn dwellers are immune to necrotic and poison damage and cannot be coup de graced. Thus, the only means to actually destroy one is a *disintegration* spell or ritual magic.\n\nCairn dwellers tend to wear strange cobbled-together armor that shields their faces, necks, and limbs, while leaving their torso and abdomens exposed. They equip themselves with whatever hand weapons they find as grave goods.\n\n###### Ecology\n\nEach cell will be led by a champion with 3 AC, 3 HD, 16 hp, and a +2 damage bonus.

Leaders should also be assigned magic items by HD using the ***ACKS II JJ***rules (p. XX). The most dangerous few still possess the weapon they brought with them millennia ago — the thunder-lance.
