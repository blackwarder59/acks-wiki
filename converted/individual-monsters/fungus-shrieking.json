  "markdown": "### Fungus, Shrieking\n\nA shrieking fungus, sometimes called a shrieker, is a sessile fungus that grows in dark, subterranean places. Resembling a 3’ tall mushroom, shriekers are pale lavender to dull gray in color, dotted with purple spots. Shrieking fungi closely resemble violet fungi, with which they often grow in symbiotic patches. They are named for their notorious propensity for making a loud noise when disturbed. Found in dank caves, damp dungeons, and other dark, wet locations underground, they are virtually never seen on the surface. Some sporecasters have claimed that shrieking fungi can grow in the dank flesh of birds or mammals. However, this has not been confirmed by the sages of the Tower of Knowledge, who found the whole investigation rather appalling.\n\n###### Combat\n\nShrieking fungi lack the senses of ordinary animals. However, the spots on their caps are **photosensitive** and can detect light to a range of 60’. They also **echolocate**,emitting a constant subsonic hum with which they can “see” to a range of 30’.\n\nImmediately upon detecting light or movement, shriekers begin to emit the wailing scream that gives them their name.
