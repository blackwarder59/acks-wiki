Various sub-species can be found throughout the rivers, lakes, ponds, estuaries, coasts, and swamps of Aurëpos. They tend to stay near the bottom of the water where logs, vegetation, mud, and sand can provide shelter.\n\n###### Combat\n\nGiant catfish have highly developed olfactory rosettes which afford them **acute olfaction**. They gain a +1 bonus to avoid surprise in their natural habitat. They can track the scent of blood in the water for up to 2 miles with the equivalent of one rank of Tracking proficiency.\n\nThey can use their whiskers for **aquatic mechanoreception**,enabling them to “see” in water up to 480’ by sensing changes in water current and water pressure. Spells or effects that would ordinarily cause blindness do not affect the catfish while it is using aquatic mechanoreception. However, creatures that are not in the water are invisible to them. Aquatic mechanoreception does not penetrate structures or terrain features.\n\nIn combat, giant catfish can attack with their four whisker-like feelers and their vicious bite.\n\n###### Ecology\n\nUnlike most fish, a giant catfish extends parental care towards its offspring. The female deposit the eggs in a nest dug by the male, and the male then guards the nest and aerates the eggs until they hatch. Therefore, when a nest of giant catfish is encountered, the fish will be guarding 4d6 x 10 eggs.
