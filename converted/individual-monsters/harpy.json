  "markdown": "### Harpy\n\nAccording to Zaharan legend, the first harpies were born of the union of Nasga, Chthonic goddess of beauty and pain, by Ornaron, Chthonic god of the thundering skies. Harpies have the faces, breasts, arms, and abdomens of hideous women, but the wings, talons, and tail feathers of giant eagles. They stand about 6’ tall, with wings spanning 15’, and weigh 150 lbs.\n\nHarpies typically speak Ancient Zaharan, Common, and the local beastman dialects.\n\n###### Combat\n\nAs a full-round action, a harpy can sing an **enthralling song**.Once begun, the song continues until the start of the harpy’s next initiative or until it is slain. While a harpy is singing, each creature within earshot of it (45’ in normal environments), other than another harpy, must make a Spells saving throw at the start of its initiative. If more than one harpy is singing, the creature saves once with a -2 penalty for each additional harpy in earshot.\n\nIf the saving throw succeeds, the creature gains immunity to the effects of every harpy’s enthralling songs for 1 turn. If the saving throw fails, the creature becomes **enthralled**. On its initiative, an enthralled creature will move at combat speed towards the nearest harpy that enthralled it; if within 5’ of the harpy, or directly beneath it (if flying), the creature will remain stationary. The creature cannot take full-round actions, combat actions, or even speak, and is **vulnerable** to the harpies’ attacks.\n\nA creature remains enthralled until the effect is dispelled, the harpy is slain, or 6 turns elapse. Harpies delight in inflicting torment on their victims, and rarely kill them outright. Only when a harpy has played with her new “toys” for 1d6 turns will she release them from suffering by killing and consuming them.\n\nIf forced to fight, harpies take to the air, attacking with their eagle talons and/or with weapons (usually shortbows or javelins) carried in their arms. Harpies instinctually know how to take advantage of vulnerable targets (as Ambushing proficiency).\n\n###### Ecology\n\nHarpies inhabit bleak moors, dead forests, rocky cliffs, and other desolate and barren landscapes. Harpies reproduce by parthenogenesis without need for fertilization by males. When harpies are encountered in their nest, there is a 10% chance per harpy that it will be rearing offspring. Roll 1d4 for age and number: 1, 1d4 eggs, 2-4 1d2 juveniles. Eggs have 1 hp and weigh 1/6 st.\n\n###### Spoils\n\nA slain harpy can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the following components useful in magic research:\n\n* vocal cords (4/6 st, 40gp, *angelic choir, bewitch humanoid, dominate humanoid, enslave humanoid*)\n* wingtips (4/6 st, 40gp, winged flight)\n\n![](data:image/png;base64...)\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Harpy Primary Characteristics** | |\n| **Type:** | Monstrosity (sapient) |\n| **Size:** | Man-sized (15 st.) |\n| **Speed (land):** | 20’ / 60’ |\n| **Speed (fly):** | 50’ / 150’ |\n| **Armor Class:** | 2 |\n| **Hit Dice:** | 3\\*\\* |\n| **Attacks:** | 3 (2 talons, weapon, 8+) |\n| **Damage:** | 1d4 {S!} / 1d4 {S!} / 1d6 {W} |\n| **Save:** | F6 |\n| **Morale:** | -1 |\n| **Vision:** | Lightless Vision (60’) |\n| **Other Senses:** | Standard |\n| **Proficiencies:** | Ambushing |\n| **Normal Load:** | 9 st. |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Harpy Secondary Characteristics** | |\n| **Expedition Speed:** | 60 miles (air) or 12 miles (land) |\n| **Supply Cost:** | 2gp (carnivorous) |\n| **Training Period:** | 1 month (sapient) |\n| **Training Modifier:** | None (sapient) |\n| **Battle Rating:** | 0.884 (individual), 106 (unit) |\n| **Lifespan:** | E/1/12/18/54/110/200/250 |\n| **Reproduction:** | 1d4 eggs per 9 years |\n| **Untrained Value:** | 170gp (A) /600gp (J) / 435gp (E) |\n| **Trained Value:** | 21,000gp |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Harpy Encounter Set-Up** | |\n| **Lair:** | 25% |\n| **Dungeon Enc:** | Flight (1d6) / Nest (2d4) |\n| **Wilderness Enc:** | Wing (2d4) / Nest (2d4) |\n| **Alignment:** | Chaotic |\n| **Treasure Type:** | E |\n| **XP:** | 80 |\n\nA harpy’s 4d12 flight feathers each fetch 1d6gp and weigh 1/25 st.\n\n",
