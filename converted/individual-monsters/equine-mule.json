  "markdown": "### Equine, Mule\n\nMules are a hybrid of a donkey and a medium horse. Mules are primarily used for draft, but can be used for riding or war. Mules are never found in the wild and never have young. Because of their **sure-footedness**, mules can be taken into the depths of a dungeon to aid in transporting equipment or treasure and their movement multiplier in mountain hexes is x2/3 instead of x1/2.\n\n###### Combat\n\nMules are notoriously ornery, and may attack if particularly provoked. Like horses, mules can benefit from **training for war**. War-trained mules gain +2 to morale but does not gain an extra hoof attack. The rider of a war-trained mule can attack with a charge, dealing double damage with a lance, and a war-trained mule can attack with its hoof during the charge as well.\n\n###### Ecology\n\nWhen a mule herd is encountered, there is a 10% chance it will be accompanied by 1 medium horse, 1 donkey, 1d4 juvenile mules and 1d2 baby mules.

Their ability to travel long distances quickly is limited by their stamina as well as speed, so mules have their expeditions peed adjusted by the lower of DEX or CON bonus x 2.5 miles.
