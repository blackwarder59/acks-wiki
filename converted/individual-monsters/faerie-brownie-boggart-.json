A brownie labors nightly when the householders are asleep, invisibly performing menial chores such as cleaning away spider webs, sweeping the floor, and stacking hay bales. They avoid contact with the folks they aid, and dwell within unused areas of the house or farm. In exchange for their help, brownies expect small gifts of food, delighting in milk, cream, butter, honey, and porridge.\n\nFailure in this tribute, idleness on the part of the people they support, taking their assistance for granted, lavish gifting, or worse – insisting that the tribute given is payment or wage – enrages these faeries.\n\nAn enraged brownie becomes Chaotic in alignment, and is called a boggart. A boggart will use its invisibility and great strength to punish the family. It will break items, set loose or attack livestock, torment children and pets, steal and hide needed tools and implements, and in some cases assault and injure those responsible, until finally fleeing to another habitation where it feels its help is more welcome.\n\nBrownies are found in the northern shores of Aurëpos, particularly in Northern Argollë, Jutland, and Rorn. Though some dwell in Southern Argollë, they are otherwise very rare in the south, where nymphs rather than faeries reign.\n\nThey speak the lilting language of faeries and the languages spoken by dwarves, elves, and humans of their region.\n\n###### Combat\n\nDespite their tiny stature, brownies are **immensely strong** and gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls in melee.\n\nBrownies are naturally **invisible**, but can choose to become visible at will. Brownie invisibility is unlike the spell of the same name in that a brownie can act freely, including attacking, without becoming visible. However, the spell *discern invisibility* will reveal its presence.\n\n###### Ecology\n\nBrownies have no dwelling places of their own, always lairing in the homestead of humans and demi-humans. They do not have women or children of any sort. They reproduce by transforming abandoned, orphaned, and/or unloved dwarven, elven, or human children into their own kind in magic rituals performed in places of power on holy days.
