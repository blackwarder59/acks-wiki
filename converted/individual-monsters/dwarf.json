  "markdown": "### Dwarf\n\nDwarves are short, stout demi-humans that average 4' tall but weigh as much as adult humans. Their skin can be very dark, but it is always some shade of tan or brown. Hair color can be black, gray, or brown. Dwarves favor earth tones in their clothing and prefer simple and functional garb.\n\nThey dwell in forbidding mountain ranges such as the Meniri and Jutting Mountains, where they carve great vaults from the living rock. Tunnels connect the vault to the mines, mushroom farms, and terraces wherein the dwarves toil.\n\n###### Combat\n\nDwarves encountered outside a vault will be squads or companies of sentries (1st level vaultguards) on a mission or warrior pilgrimage. 50% of the sentries will be equipped with spears, hand axes, shields, and banded plate, while 50% will be crossbowmen equipped with arbalest, hand axe, and chain. All of the sentries will be **skilled warriors** who gain a +1 damage bonus.\n\nDwarven sentries will generally be intent on accomplishing whatever mission has brought them out of their vault. However, they revile goblins with such hatred that they will automatically have Hostile reactions to any encountered.\n\n###### Ecology\n\nEach squad will be led by a 2nd level vaultguard. Each company will be led by a 4th level vaultguard assisted by 2 3rd level vaultguards.\n\nWhen dwarves are encountered in a vault, it will be led a dwarven vaultguard of level 5+1d4. As long as the chief is alive, the dwarves will gain a +2 bonus to morale rolls. There is a 50% chance the vault will be ministered to by a dwarven craftpriest of level 5+1d4 and a 60% chance the vault will be protected by trained animals, either 5d4 war dogs or 2d4 brown bears.\n\nA newly-established vault will typically have few or no other residents, but in a long-established vault, additional dwarves will be present. In addition to the vaultguard companies, the vault will be protected by a militia (0th level troops) of up to 200% of the number of dwarven vaultguards. Dwarven militia have Sped 90’, AC 5, 1-1 HD, and ML 0. They are usually equipped with chain mail, shield, and war hammer or battle axe.\n\nA long-established vault will also be home to various dwarven workers, noncombatants (adolescent, disabled, elderly, nursing, or pregnant), and juveniles up to a maximum of 850%, 850% and 1200% of the number of vaultguards respectively. Workers have Spd 120’, AC 0, 1d4 hp, ML -2, and are equipped with hand axes. Noncombatants and juveniles have Spd 90’, AC 0, 1 hp, ML -4, and do not fight. The vaultguards and militia will fight to the death to defend the noncombatants and juveniles.\n\nDwarven leaders should be assigned magic items using the ***ACKS II JJ***rules (p. XX).\n\n![](data:image/png;base64...)\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Dwarf Primary Characteristics** | |\n| **Type:** | Humanoid (demi-human) |\n| **Size:** | Man-sized (15 st.) |\n| **Speed (land):** | 20’ / 60’ or 30’ / 90’ |\n| **Armor Class:** | 6 or 4 |\n| **Hit Dice:** | 1 |\n| **Attacks:** | 1 (weapon 10+) |\n| **Damage:** | By weapon +1 {W} |\n| **Save:** | D1 |\n| **Morale:** | +1 |\n| **Vision:** | Standard |\n| **Other Senses:** | Standard |\n| **Proficiencies:** | Listening 14+, Searching 14+ |\n| **Normal Load:** | 5 st. |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Dwarf Secondary Characteristics** | |\n| **Expedition Speed:** | 12 miles |\n| **Supply Cost:** | 0.5gp |\n| **Training Period:** | 1 month (sapient) |\n| **Training Modifier:** | None (sapient) |\n| **Battle Rating:** | 0.010 – 0.094 (ind.), 1 – 5.5 (unit) |\n| **Lifespan:** | 0/3/15/26/51/76/116/150 |\n| **Untrained Value:** | 40gp (A) / 8gp (J) / 3gp (B) |\n| **Trained Value:** | 235gp or more (sapient) |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Dwarf Encounter Set-Up** | |\n| **Lair:** | 50% |\n| **Dungeon Enc:** | Squad (1d6) /Redoubt (1 company) |\n| **Wilderness Enc:** | Company (1d12 squads) /  Vault (1d10 companies) |\n| **Alignment:** | Lawful, Neutral |\n| **Treasure Type:** | D x 2 (per company) |\n| **XP:** | 10 (warrior), 5 (militia), 20 (squad leader), 50 (company subaltern), 80 (company commander) |\n\n###### Spoils\n\nA slain dwarf can be harvested with Healing 1 for the following component:\n\n* hands (1/6 st., 10gp, *crafting, locate treasure*)\n\n",
