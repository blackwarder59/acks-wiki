  "markdown": "### Dragon Turtle\n\nThis massive beast has the arms, legs, head, and tail of a dragon with the torso and shell of a turtle. The dragon turtle’s rough, deep green shell is much the same color as the deep water the monster favors, and the silver highlights that line the shell resemble light dancing on open water. The turtle’s legs, tail, and head are a lighter green, flecked with golden highlights. A full-grown dragon turtle measures about 130’ in shell diameter and weighs about 115,000 lbs. They can speak Draconic, though true dragons consider their accent crass.\n\n###### Combat\n\nDragon turtles have **acute olfaction** that grants them a +1 bonus to avoid surprise in their natural habitat. Their **aquatic mechanoreception** enables them to “see” in water up to 270’ by sensing changes in water current and water pressure. Spells or effects that would ordinarily cause blindness do not affect the dragon turtle while it is using aquatic mechanoreception. However, creatures that are not in the water are invisible to the sense. Aquatic mechanoreception does not penetrate structures or terrain features.\n\nDragon turtles are **highly aggressive** (-3 penalty to reaction rolls) and frequently sink ships sailing across their territory. They can attack with their powerful claw and bite or with their **breath weapon**, a hot blistering cloud of steam 90’ long and 30’ wide that deals 36d6 {F!}damage to all creatures in its area of effect, or half that on a successful Blast save.\n\n###### Ecology\n\nDragon turtles make their lairs in submerged caverns deep under the water, where they hoard wealth from ships that have sunk to the bottom of the sea.\n\nDragon turtles mate only a few times per century, but a dragon turtle egg can take almost a decade to hatch. When a dragon turtle is encountered in its lair, there is a 30% chance it will be a female incubating 1d2 eggs. Dragon turtle eggs have 40 hp and weigh a titanic 200 st. When a dragon turtle egg hatches, the emerging spawn is driven off by its parent immediately to avoid competition for food. Fortunately, the spawn (at AC 9 and 18 HD) is already incredibly powerful and more than capable of fending for itself.\n\n###### Spoils\n\nA slain dragon turtle can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the following components useful in magic research:\n\n* beak (53 2/6 st, 3,200gp, *dismember, sharpness, swift strike,* weapon +4)\n* lungs (53 2/6 st, 3,200gp*, cone of frost, swimming, water breathing*)\n* shell-plates (51 4/6 st, 3,100gp, *capsizing wave, cataclysm, level water,* armor +4)\n\nEach of a dragon turtle's two horns fetch 2d6 x 250gp and weigh 1 st per 80gp value. A dragon turtle’s armored hide fetches 17,000gp and weighs 305 st.\n\n![](data:image/png;base64...)\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Dragon Turtle Primary Characteristics** | |\n| **Type:** | Monstrosity (sapient) |\n| **Size:** | Colossal (11,500 st.) |\n| **Speed (land):** | 10’ / 30' |\n| **Speed (swim):** | 30’ / 90’ |\n| **Armor Class:** | 12 |\n| **Hit Dice:** | 36\\* |\n| **Attacks:** | 3 (2 claws, bite -10+) or 1 (breath) |\n| **Damage:** | 1d8 {S!} /1d8 {S!} /1d6x10 {P!} or 36d6 {F!} |\n| **Save:** | F15 |\n| **Morale:** | +2 |\n| **Vision:** | Lightless Vision (60’), Night Vision |\n| **Other Senses:** | Acute Olfaction, Aquatic Mechanoreception (270’) |\n| **Proficiencies:** | None |\n| **Normal Load:** | 2,300 st. |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Dragon Turtle Secondary Characteristics** | |\n| **Expedition Speed:** | 18 miles (water) or 6 miles (land) |\n| **Supply Cost:** | 960gp (carnivorous) |\n| **Training Period:** | 1 month (sapient) |\n| **Training Modifier:** | None (sapient) |\n| **Battle Rating:** | 11 (individual / unit) |\n| **Lifespan:** | E/7/33/67/100/135/535/1350 |\n| **Reproduction:** | 1d2 eggs per 5d10 years |\n| **Untrained Value:** | 18,400gp (A)/5,500gp (J)/600gp (E) |\n| **Trained Value:** | 260,000gp (sapient war mount) |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Dragon Turtle Encounter Set-Up** | |\n| **Lair:** | 5% |\n| **Dungeon Enc:** | None |\n| **Wilderness Enc:** | Solitary (1) / Lair (1) |\n| **Alignment:** | Chaotic |\n| **Treasure Type:** | R, N |\n| **XP:** | 9,500 |\n\n",
