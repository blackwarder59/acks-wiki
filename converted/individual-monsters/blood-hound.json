  "markdown": "### Blood Hound\n\nA blood hound is a necromantic attack beast created from a lithe human corpse. With its skin stripped to ease movement and entrails removed to reduce weight, the corpse’s arm and leg joints are twisted and re-set, permitting the blood hound to crawl swift and low to the ground. The tongue is set with a hollow tip of sharp bone, and reattached with its base inside the mouth rather than down the throat; this, gives the blood hound a piercing tongue attack that it can use in close quarters. The tongue is also used to drain a victim's blood, replenishing it's necrotic flesh and permitting it to retain its flexibility.\n\n###### Combat\n\nBlood hounds have **acute olfaction** and gain a +1 bonus to avoid surprise in its natural habitat. They can track the scent of creatures for up to 6 miles with the equivalent of three ranks of Tracking proficiency.\n\nWhen they reach their prey, blood hounds claw with ragged, filthy, bone-like talons and lash with their spiky tongues. A blood hound can use its tongue attack to deal damage or to make a **Knockdown** special maneuver using Combat Trickery (Knockdown). If the blood hound damages a living creature with its tongue attack, the tongue attaches to the creature struck and begins to **drain its blood**.\n\nThereafter the blood hound can automatically deal 1d4 {N} damage to the creature each round without having to make an attack throw. Doing so counts as the blood hound’s attack with the tongue. Creatures that are having their blood drained by a blood hound can still move, but count as carrying 12 extra stone of encumbrance. The blood hound moves with the creature it is drinking blood from.\n\nA creature can only escape or be freed from the tongue by killing the blood hound or severing the tongue. To cut the tongue, a creature must deal 4 or more slashing damage to it in one blow. (Any damage dealt beyond 4 points is not dealt to the blood hound.) If the tongue is severed, the blood hound can no longer make tongue attacks.\n\nLike all undead, blood hounds are immune to enchantment effects, necrotic damage, and poisonous damage.
