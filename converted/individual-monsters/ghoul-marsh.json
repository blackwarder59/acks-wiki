  "markdown": "### Ghoul, Marsh\n\nThese murderous undead resemble men, save that their backs are horribly hunched, their teeth jagged, and their skin clammy greenish-brown pallid hue. Marsh ghouls are as greedy in undeath as they were in life, and enjoy collecting treasures from the dead. When not hunting or eating, they can spend hours counting their gold, silver, and gems.\n\n###### Combat\n\nMarsh ghouls are **naturally stealthy**, and characters encountering them have a -2 penalty to avoid surprise.\n\nThey have long-fingered hands with sharp talons at the end of their fingertips, which they use to rake their targets for 1d6 slashing damage. If both claws successfully strike in one round, the marsh ghoul **strangles** its target.\n\nThe strangled creature immediately suffers an additional 2d6 bludgeoning damage. In addition, if the creature is an animal, monstrosity, or humanoid, it also begins **choking**. Thereafter, the marsh ghoul can use its combat action to automatically deal 2d6 bludgeoning damage to the choking creature each round. The choking creature cannot take any actions or speak. A creature that has been choking for 10 consecutive rounds starts **slumbering** at the end of the round.\n\nThe unfortunate creatures incapacitated by marsh ghouls are carried back to their lairs to be consumed. The creatures that survive their predations are perhaps even more unfortunate. Any humanoid creature that suffers the loss of 50% or more of its total hp to a marsh ghoul is infected with **ghoul fever** and will become a marsh ghoul in 2d6 days. This transformation can be prevented with the divine spell *cure disease* if cast before the disease has taken full hold.\n\nAs undead, marsh ghouls are immune to enchantment effects, necrotic damage, and poisonous damage. They are inherently evil for purposes of *discern evil*and *holy circle*spells. They are rebuked as ghouls.\n\n###### Ecology\n\nMarsh ghouls dwell in sunless cellars, graveyards, or ruins in dark bogs, fetid marshes, or forbidding swamps, emerging only to hunt for victims.\n\nThey tend to keep their victims’ bones in sacks so that they can consume the bone-marrow at their leisure. When marsh ghouls are encountered in a cellar, there will be 1d4 sacks of bones per creature.\n\n###### Spoils\n\nA destroyed marsh ghoul can be harvested with Healing 2 for the following components useful in magic research:\n\n* claws (2/6 st., 20gp, *choking grip, swimming*)\n* liver (1/6 st., 10gp, *cause disease*)\n\n![](data:image/png;base64...)\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Marsh Ghoul Primary Characteristics** | |\n| **Type:** | Undead |\n| **Size:** | Man-sized (15 st.) |\n| **Speed (land):** | 40’ / 120’ |\n| **Speed (swim):** | 20’ / 60’ |\n| **Armor Class:** | 5 |\n| **Hit Dice:** | 3\\*\\* |\n| **Attacks:** | 2 (claws 8+) |\n| **Damage:** | 1d6 {S!} /1d6 {S!} |\n| **Save:** | F3 |\n| **Morale:** | +1 |\n| **Vision:** | Lightless Vision (60’) |\n| **Other Senses:** | Standard |\n| **Proficiencies:** | None |\n| **Normal Load:** | 5 st. |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Marsh Ghoul Secondary Characteristics** | |\n| **Expedition Speed:** | 24 miles (Land), 12 miles (water) |\n| **Supply Cost:** | 2gp (carnivorous) |\n| **Training Period:** | 1 month (sapient) |\n| **Training Modifier:** | None (sapient) |\n| **Battle Rating:** | 0.089 (individual), 10.5 (unit) |\n| **Lifespan:** | Indefinite |\n| **Reproduction:** | By infection |\n| **Untrained Value:** | 80gp (A) / - / - |\n| **Trained Value:** | 2,100gp (controlled) |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Marsh Ghoul Encounter Set-Up** | |\n| **Lair:** | 35% |\n| **Dungeon Enc:** | Pack (1d10) / Cellar (2d4 packs) |\n| **Wilderness Enc:** | Pack (1d10) / Cellar (2d4 packs) |\n| **Alignment:** | Chaotic |\n| **Treasure Type:** | N |\n| **XP:** | 80 |\n\n###### Lore\n\n*‘Ware the marsh-ghoul where it waits,*\n\n*In silence by the hellish gates,*\n\n*Where bones, stripped bare, within sacks lie,*\n\n*For feasting marrow under stygian sky.*\n\n* Borderlands nursery rhyme\n\n",
