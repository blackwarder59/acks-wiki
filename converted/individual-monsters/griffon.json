  "markdown": "### Griffon\n\nGriffons are powerful, majestic creatures crossbred from eagles and lions. Their forebody, front legs, head, and wings are those of a giant eagle while their hindquarters, hind legs, and tail are those of a lion. A typical griffon weighs around 825 lbs and measures 8’ long with a wingspan of 25’. Griffons are fierce carnivores with a particular taste for horse flesh.\n\n###### Combat\n\nLike eagles, griffons have **acute vision** and **alertness**, granting them a +2 bonus to avoid surprise in their natural habitat.\n\nThey prefer horseflesh to all other meat, and if a party encountering griffons has one or more horses, the griffons are automatically Hostile. The griffons will always attack the horses first, though they can switch targets later to defend themselves.\n\nA flying griffon can make a **dive attack** with its talons. A dive attack inflicts double the normal damage (2d4/2d4). If the griffon hits a creature smaller than itself with both its talons while making a dive attack, the creature must make a size-adjusted Paralysis saving throw. If the save fails, the creature is **grabbed**.\n\n###### Ecology\n\nWhen griffons are encountered in their aerie, there is a 25% chance each griffon is guarding offspring. Roll 1d6f or number and age: 1-2, it’s 1d3 eggs, 3-6, it’s 1 juvenile. Juvenile griffons have AC 1, Spd 90’, HD 3+2, and attack with 2 talons (1d2 {S}) and 1 bite (1d8 {P}). They cannot fly. Griffon eggs have 1 hp and weigh 3/6 st.\n\nThe valuable offspring are not easy to claim, because griffons are intensely protective of their young.
