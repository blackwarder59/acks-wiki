They measure about 8’ long and 7’ tall and weigh about 1,500 lbs.\n\nAccording to Zaharan myth, the first lamia was a priestess of Nasga who displeased the goddess of pain and beauty by becoming a mother without her permission. To punish her wayward cultist, Nasga forced her to devour her own infant, thereafter transforming her into a monstrosity that hungers for the flesh of the young. Even today, lamia delight in nothing more than devouring children.\n\nAs intelligent as human beings, lamia can speak Ancient Zaharan, Common, Elvish, and the dialect of any local beastmen.\n\n###### Combat\n\nThough a lamia is powerful and dangerous in close combat, it has no stomach for a fair fight, preferring to use its spell-like abilities to befuddle, bewitch, and deceive its prey. At will, a lamia can use *perpetual figment*, *spectral figment,* and *word of command*. Once per day, it can use *bewitch humanoid* and *illusory duplicates*.\n\nIf forced to fight, a lamia can attack with a weapon (often a composite bow or spear) or with its serpentine tail. The tail deals 1d6 {B!} damage and any creature damaged by it is drained of 1 point of WIL permanently. When a creature reaches WIL 3, it becomes permanently **enslaved** to the lamia. No magic short of *miracle* or *wish* can restore WIL lost to a lamia’s scaly touch or free a creature enslaved to it.\n\n###### Ecology\n\nLamia are often found in ruins or labyrinths, waiting for unsuspecting adventurers. They reproduce but rarely, in congress with human men they have enslaved into their service. Such children, always female, are reared far from the lamia, for the creatures would devour their own offspring as readily as another’s. The young lamia’s true nature does not reveal itself until the child reaches adolescence and undergoes a horrific metamorphosis.\n\n###### Spoils\n\nA slain lamia can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the following components useful in magic research:\n\n* fingers (11 4/6 st, 700gp, *enslave humanoid, madness of crowds, weakness of mind*)\n* hair (11 4/6 st., 700gp, *illusory duplicates, mirage, perpetual figment*)\n* heart (11 4/6 st, 700gp, *bewitch humanoid*)\n* tongue (6 4/6 st, 400gp, *discern gist, tongues, word of command*)\n\n![](data:image/png;base64...)\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Lamia Primary Characteristics** | |\n| **Type:** | Monstrosity (sapient) |\n| **Size:** | Large (150 st.) |\n| **Speed (land):** | 40’ / 240’ |\n| **Armor Class:** | 7 |\n| **Hit Dice:** | 9\\*\\*\\* |\n| **Attacks:** | 1 (hoof or weapon 2+) |\n| **Damage:** | 1d6 {B!} + WIS drain or  by weapon {W} |\n| **Save:** | F9 |\n| **Morale:** | +1 |\n| **Vision:** | Lightless Vision (60’), Night Vision |\n| **Other Senses:** | Standard |\n| **Proficiencies:** | None |\n| **Normal Load:** | 30 st. |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Lamia Secondary Characteristics** | |\n| **Expedition Speed:** | 48 miles |\n| **Supply Cost:** | 16gp (carnivorous) |\n| **Training Period:** | 1 month (sapient) |\n| **Training Modifier:** | None (sapient) |\n| **Battle Rating:** | 3.25 (individual), 195 (unit) |\n| **Lifespan:** | E/1.66/20/27/50/75/100/125 |\n| **Reproduction:** | 1 egg every 5 years |\n| **Untrained Value:** | 2,500gp (A)/1,250gp (J)/825gp (B) |\n| **Trained Value:** | 77,000gp (sapient) |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Lamia Encounter Set-Up** | |\n| **Lair:** | 40% |\n| **Dungeon Enc:** | Solitary (1) / Lair (1) |\n| **Wilderness Enc:** | Solitary (1) / Lair (1) |\n| **Alignment:** | Chaotic |\n| **Treasure Type:** | N |\n| **XP:** | 2,500 |\n\n",
