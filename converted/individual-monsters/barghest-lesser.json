  "markdown": "### Barghest, Lesser\n\nIskara, mother of monsters, bred the first barghests by infusing cacodemon ichor into the bodies of great wolves. The lesser barghests were bred with hellions (8 HD cacodemons). Though called “lesser”, these barghests are larger and stronger than even wargs, with a length of 12’, a height of 7’3” at the shoulder, and a weight of 2,100 lbs. Barghests are as intelligent as mortal men. They can speak Ancient Zaharan, Classical Auran, Common, Elvish, and the dialect of any local beastmen.\n\n###### Combat\n\nLesser barghests have **acute hearing** and **acute olfaction.** They gain a +2 bonus to avoid surprise in their natural habitat. They can track the scent of creatures for up to 6 miles with the equivalent of three ranks of Tracking proficiency.\n\nDue to their powerful jaws, lesser barghests have **bone-breaking bites**. If the barghest succeeds on an attack throw with an unmodified 20, the creature bitten must make a Death saving throw. If the save succeeds, the creature suffers double the ordinary damage dice (6d6). If the save fails, the creature suffers triple the ordinary damage (9d6) and has a limb broken. Roll 1d6 to determine which limb is broken: 1-2 weapon hand, 3 weapon arm, 4-5 near leg, 6 far leg.\n\nA broken limb has the same game effect as a missing limb (***ACKS II RR***Permanent Wounds tables, p. XX – XX) until it heals. A broken wound heals after 180 days, or 90 days under treatment of a healer.\n\n###### Ecology\n\nLesser barghest studs mate rather indiscriminately, freely coupling with lesser barghests, wargs, dire wolves, and wolves in order to produce various lupin sub-species. Lesser barghest bitches reproduce only with greater or lesser barghests.\n\nWhen lesser barghests are encountered in their den, the adults will be rearing puppies. Roll 1d6 for age and number: 1-4, it’s 1d2 juveniles, 5-6 it’s 1d2+2 babies. Juveniles have AC 3, Spd 150’, HD 4+1, and attack with 1 bite (1d10). Babies have AC 2, Spd 150’, HD 2+3, and 1 bite (1d4). The bites of the puppies are not venomous or maiming.\n\nThere is a 10% chance the den will be ruled by a **greater barghest**. If so, then any offspring will be greater barghest juveniles and babies.\n\n###### Spoils\n\nA slain barghest can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the following components useful in magic research:\n\n* fangs (9 2/6 st, 550gp, *carnage, dismember, ogre strength, slicing blow*)\n* heart (9 2/6 st, 550gp, *call of the wolf pack, dominate beast, frighten beast*)\n\n![](data:image/png;base64...)\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Lesser Barghest Primary Characteristics** | |\n| **Type:** | Monstrosity (sapient) |\n| **Size:** | Huge (210 st.) |\n| **Speed (land):** | 60’ / 180’ |\n| **Armor Class:** | 5 |\n| **Hit Dice:** | 8+2\\* |\n| **Attacks:** | 1 (bite 2+) |\n| **Damage:** | 3d6 {P!} |\n| **Save:** | F8 |\n| **Morale:** | +3 |\n| **Vision:** | Lightless Vision (60’), Night Vision |\n| **Other Senses:** | Acute Hearing, Acute Olfaction |\n| **Proficiencies:** | Listening 8+, Tracking 3+ |\n| **Normal Load:** | 64 st. |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Lesser Barghest Secondary Characteristics** | |\n| **Expedition Speed:** | 36 miles (land) |\n| **Supply Cost:** | 48gp (carnivorous) |\n| **Training Period:** | 1 month (sapient) |\n| **Training Modifier:** | None (sapient) |\n| **Battle Rating:** | 1.022 (individual), 20.5 (unit) |\n| **Lifespan:** | 0/8/25/50/100/150/200/245 |\n| **Reproduction:** | 1d2+2 pups per 25 years |\n| **Untrained Value:** | 1,275gp (A)/100gp (J)/ 8gp (B) |\n| **Trained Value:** | 24,275gp |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Lesser Barghest Encounter Set-Up** | |\n| **Lair:** | 10% |\n| **Dungeon Enc:** | Solitary (1) / Den (1d4) |\n| **Wilderness Enc:** | Pack (1d4) / Den (1d4) |\n| **Alignment:** | Chaotic |\n| **Treasure Type:** | L, J |\n| **XP:** | 1,100 |\n\nIf not used for magic research, a lesser barghest’s fangs fetch 18gp and weigh 2/6 st.
