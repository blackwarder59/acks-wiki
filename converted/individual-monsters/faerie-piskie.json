  "markdown": "### Faerie, Piskie\n\nThese attractive faeries resemble 2’ tall boys and girls with elfin features and green eyes, clad in green or red clothes and caps.\n\nLargely benign, they spend their days dancing, wrestling, and exploring. That they enjoy nothing more than riding horses or ponies, whether these belong to them or not, does not endear them to travelers. Piskies show little malice to others, though they are mischievous by nature and delight in confusing and misleading outsiders. Only the pixies and sprites are regarded with real enmity, and it is not uncommon for conflict to break about between bands of piskies and those other faeries.\n\nPiskies have a love of finery, and the easiest way to win their cooperation is in gifting them with shiny trinkets, fine ribbons, and well-made clothing in green and red as suits their stature. (Double the bonus from Bribery when offering finery.)\n\nLike other faeries, piskies are found primarily in northern Aurëpos, particularly in Northern Argollë, Jutland, and Rorn. Though some dwell in Southern Argollë, they are otherwise very rare in the south, where nymphs rather than faeries reign.\n\nThey speak the lilting language of faeries and the languages spoken by elves and humans of their region.\n\n###### Combat\n\nPiskies are notorious for their ability to confound and confuse those that encounter them. Every piskie can use *incite madness* at will as a spell-like ability. If forced to fight, piskies arm themselves with tiny bows (the size of slingshots), lances (the size of javelins) and swords (the size of daggers). They sometimes ride foals or ponies into battle.\n\n###### Ecology\n\nPiskies live within barrows or beneath stone circles, dolmens, and menhir. They will not dwell in places of death that have become sinkholes of evil, however.\n\nThey reproduce by breathing life into elven infants who have died of accident or injury. When an elven child dies from a horseback fall or other mishap, the parents will often pray the piskies will come for the body so that their child might live on as a piskie. The transformations require complex magic rituals performed in places of power on holy days. The newborn piskie remembers his or her old life dimly as if a dream, which fades with time.\n\nWhen piskies are encountered in a wilderness lair, there is a 70% chance that there will be a herd of wild horses grazing in the vicinity.\n\n###### Spoils\n\nA slain piskie can be harvested with Healing 1 for the following component:\n\n* scalp (1/6 st, 13gp, *incite madness, madness of crowds, shrinking*)\n\n![](data:image/png;base64...)\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Piskie Primary Characteristics** | |\n| **Type:** | Enchanted Humanoid |\n| **Size:** | Small (1 ½ st.) |\n| **Speed (land):** | 40’ / 120’ |\n| **Armor Class:** | 5 |\n| **Hit Dice:** | 1\\* |\n| **Attacks:** | 1 (tiny bow, lance, or sword 10+) |\n| **Damage:** | 1d4 {P!} |\n| **Save:** | E1 |\n| **Morale:** | 0 |\n| **Vision:** | Lightless Vision (60’) |\n| **Other Senses:** | Standard |\n| **Proficiencies:** | Combat Trickery (Wrestling), Navigation, Riding |\n| **Normal Load:** | 25 st. |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Piskie Secondary Characteristics** | |\n| **Expedition Speed:** | 24 miles |\n| **Supply Cost:** | 0.5gp |\n| **Training Period:** | 1 month (sapient) |\n| **Training Modifier:** | None (sapient) |\n| **Battle Rating:** | 0.078 (individual), 9.5 (unit) |\n| **Lifespan:** | 0/4/15/51/-/-/-/200 |\n| **Reproduction:** | Special |\n| **Untrained Value:** | 325gp (A)/165gp (J)/ 45gp (B) |\n| **Trained Value:** | 1,850gp |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Piskie Encounter Set-Up** | |\n| **Lair:** | 10% |\n| **Dungeon Enc:** | None |\n| **Wilderness Enc:** | Band (2d4) / Lair (1d4x10) |\n| **Alignment:** | Troop (1d4x10) / Lair (1d4x10) |\n| **Treasure Type:** | E |\n| **XP:** | 13 |\n\n",
