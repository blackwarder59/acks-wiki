  "markdown": "### Hobgholl\n\nA hobgholl might appear to be a hobgoblin at first glance, but these monsters are a actually a wicked, unholy magical hybrid of hobgoblin, ghoul, and troll.\n\nHobgholls have an affinity for the company of hobgoblins and trolls, and are occasionally employed as bodyguards to chiefs of those races. Despite their ghoulish bloodline, hobgholls are not undead.\n\n###### Combat\n\nHobgholls have the same paralyzing touch as a ghoul, and can regenerate as a troll for 1 hp per round. Hit points are gained at the start of each combat round.\n\nHobgholls can attack with two vicious claws or with a weapon. After a hobgholl completes a claw attack routine (including any cleaves), each humanoid it successfully struck that initiative must make a Paralysis saving throw. If the save fails, the creature struck becomes **paralyzed** at the end of the hobgholl’s initiative. If the save succeeds, the creature is not affected. The paralysis can be cured with *cure light injury*. Elves, and those with an elven bloodline, are immune to the paralysis of hobgholls.\n\n###### Ecology\n\nHobgholls are exclusively male. They can reproduce by copulating with either hobgoblin or troll breeders. However, the tainted bloodline of the hobgholl causes many of these unions to fail. Roll 1d6 upon childbirth: 1-2, the whelp is shriveled, ghoulish, and stillborn; 3-4, the whelp is an ordinary specimen of its mother’s race; 5-6, the whelp is a baby hobgholl.\n\n###### Spoils\n\nA slain hobgholl can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 2 for the following components useful in magic research:\n\n* blood (2/6 st, 20gp, *trollblood*)\n* claws (1 stone, 60gp, *halt humanoid, halt monster*)\n\n###### Lair\n\nA crumbling and abandoned watchtower has become the lair of a pack of **7 hobgholls**. At one time, the hobgholls had been prized bodyguards of a hobgoblin chief, but after the chief lost his throne to a rival the hobgholls were forced into exile.\n\n**Hobgholls (7):** Spd 120’, AC 3, HD 3\\*\\*, hp 20, 18, 15, 15, 14, 12, 10, #AT 2 or 1 (2 claws or weapon 8+), Dmg 1d3 {S} /1d3 {S} or 1d6+1 {W}, Save F3, ML +2, XP 80; Special: paralyzing claw, regeneration\n\nThe hobgholls were able to carry off some loot when they were exiled, all of which is stored in the basement of the watchtower.
