  "markdown": "### Equine, Heavy Horse\n\nHeavy horses are the largest of all equines, bred to be big, strong laborers. Most breeds of heavy horses are too placid to be trained for war, so heavy warhorses are very expensive. If trained for war, they function as noted above. Heavy horses are not usually found in the wild except through happenstance.\n\n###### Combat\n\nMost heavy horses are easily frightened (-2 Morale). Some heavy horses, however, can overcome their skittishness through **training for war**. War-trained heavy horses gain +2 to morale and (if a horse) one extra hoof attack. The rider of a war-trained heavy horse can attack with a charge, dealing double damage with a lance, and a war-trained equine can attack with its hooves during the charge as well.\n\n###### Ecology\n\nWhen a heavy horse herd is encountered, there is a 50% chance they will be a matriarchal herd with 1d6 juvenile horses and 1d2 baby horses. (Otherwise, it’s a bachelor herd.) Juveniles have AC 0, Spd 120’, HD 1+3, and attack with 1 hoof (1d3 {B}). Babies have AC -1, Spd 120’, HD 1+1, and attack with 1 hoof (1 {B}).\n\nHeavy horses are bred for strength, speed, and stamina, and finely-bred specimens often have exceptional attributes (see “Attributes for Monsters,” on p. XXX). Heavy horses with DEX 13+ have their encounter speed adjusted by 12.5’ x DEX bonus. Their combat speed is adjusted by one-third the encounter speed adjustment. Their ability to travel long distances quickly is limited by their stamina as well as speed, so heavy horses have their expedition speed adjusted by the lower of DEX or CON bonus x 2.5 miles. Equines with STR 13+ have their maximum load adjusted by their STR bonus x 4 st.\n\n###### Spoils\n\nA slain horse with exceptional attributes can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following component:\n\n* hooves (1 st., 65gp, *call of the galloping herd, safe travels, vigor*)\n\n###### Lore\n\n*While the light sandy soils of the Southern Ammasaurëan are easily worked with a scratch plough pulled by a donkey, the thick clay-rich soils of Dappakosea and Ivorea require a much heavier plough pulled by a much stronger workbeast.*\n\n*To meet this need, the northern peoples bred a fine equine commonly called the Dappakosean draft horse, Juttish horse, and Northern workhorse. Famed for its size, strength, and sweet temperament, the breed is larger than any other found in Aurëpos. Powerful as a bear but as gentle as a fawn, its shaggy coat can be bay, black, blood bay, blue roan, chestnut, gray, or red roan.*\n\n* Xenocrates, *On Horsemanship*\n\n![](data:image/png;base64...)\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Heavy Horse Primary Characteristics** | |\n| **Type:** | Animal (domestic) |\n| **Size:** | Large (200 st.) |\n| **Speed (land):** | 50’/ 150’ |\n| **Armor Class:** | 2 |\n| **Hit Dice:** | 3+3 |\n| **Attacks:** | 1 or 2 (hooves 7+) |\n| **Damage:** | 1d8 {B} /1d8 {B} |\n| **Save:** | F2 |\n| **Morale:** | -2 or 0 |\n| **Vision:** | Night Vision |\n| **Other Senses:** | Standard |\n| **Proficiencies:** | None |\n| **Normal Load:** | 40 st. |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Heavy Horse Secondary Characteristics** | |\n| **Expedition Speed:** | 30 miles |\n| **Supply Cost:** | 4gp |\n| **Training Period:** | 2 months |\n| **Training Modifier:** | 0 |\n| **Battle Rating:** | 0.029 (individual), 1.5 (unit) |\n| **Lifespan:** | 0/0.5/2/5/12/18/24/30 |\n| **Reproduction:** | 1 foal every 2 years |\n| **Untrained Value:** | 20gp (A) / 10gp (J) / 8gp (B) |\n| **Trained Value:** | 315gp (war mount)  40gp (work beast) |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Heavy Horse Encounter Set-Up** | |\n| **Lair:** | None |\n| **Dungeon Enc:** | None |\n| **Wilderness Enc:** | Herd (1d10x10) |\n| **Alignment:** | Neutral |\n| **Treasure Type:** | None |\n| **XP:** | 65 |\n\n",
