  "markdown": "### Hyena, Giant\n\nThese giant beasts resemble common hyenas, but measure 10’ in length and weigh 1,100lbs. Like hyenas they have oversized skulls and massive jaws on bear-like bodies. Their fur is tawny and leonine, with a prominent crest. Larger and slower than common hyenas, giant hyenas hunt alone or in small packs.\n\n###### Combat\n\nGiant hyenas have incredibly powerful jaws that deliver **bone-breaking bites**. On an attack throw of an unmodified 20 , the creature bitten must make a Death saving throw. If the save succeeds, the creature suffers double the ordinary damage dice (4d10 {P}). If the save fails, the creature suffers triple the ordinary damage (6d10 {P}) and has a limb broken. Roll 1d6 to determine which limb is broken: 1-2 weapon hand, 3 weapon arm, 4-5 near leg, 6 far leg.\n\nA broken limb has the same game effect as a missing limb (***ACKS II RR***Permanent Wounds tables, p. XX – XX) until it heals. A broken wound heals after 180 days, or 90 days under treatment of a healer.\n\n###### Ecology\n\nWhen giant hyenas are encountered in their den, the adults will be rearing 1d4+1 juvenile giant hyenas and 1d2 baby giant hyenas. Juvenile giant hyenas have AC 2, Spd 90’, HD 3, and attack with 1 bite (1d10 {P} + bone-crush). Baby hyenas have AC 0, Spd 90’, HD 2, and attack with 1 bite (1d4 {P}).\n\n###### Spoils\n\nLike common hyenas, giant hyenas mark their territory with a white, gooey cream known as hyena butter that they secrete from their rectum. The foul-smelling substance is sometimes collected by alchemist and shamans, as it can be used as a miscellaneous special component for magic research. There will be 2d6gp worth of hyena butter per hyena encountered.\n\nA slain giant hyena can be harvested for the following component:\n\n* jawbone (6 2/6 st, 380gp, *dismember, slicing blow,* +2 weapon)\n\nA giant hyena's hide fetches 105gp and weighs 2 5/6 st. Its fangs fetch 20gp and weigh 2/6 st.\n\n###### Lore\n\n*On my second night in the Besheradi badlands, I was awakened from my slumber by a sudden cacophony of high-pitched giggles and hysterical chuckles By the time I had roused myself enough to investigate, our guide Munatas had already armed the sentries into a formidable phalanx of bright torches and readied crossbows. In the darkness beyond the torch line I saw the shadows of great beasts, but our show of strength must have been enough, for the beasts came no closer.
