  "markdown": "### Lycanthrope, Weretiger\n\nWeretigers are lycanthropes who can transform into tigers. In their tiger form, they measure about 7’6” long and weigh about 500 lbs. In their human form, they often have almond-shaped eyes, supple muscles, and colorful streaks of black or gold in their hair.\n\nThe Chthonic god Ravanor, the Bitter Prince, created the first weretigers to cause terror in the weak and innocent. Like their god, weretigers are arrogant, cunning, and utterly ruthless.\n\nWeretigers prefer to find mates from among the human population, seeking out the most beautiful and healthy specimens and infecting them with lycanthropy.\n\n###### Combat\n\nIn beast form, weretigers have **acute hearing** and **acute olfaction.** They gain a +2 bonus to avoid surprise in their natural habitat. They can track the scent of creatures for up to 4 miles with the equivalent of two ranks of Tracking proficiency.\n\nAs beasts, they are also **quite agile** (Acrobatics 12+) and **good climbers** (Climbing 5+). Their **lightning reflexes** grant a +1 bonus to initiative. They are **naturally stealthy** when in native habitats, where creatures encountering them suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls.\n\nIf a weretiger charges a creature or leaps over it (using Acrobatics), and successfully hits it with both claws, it immediately **pounces** onthe creature. The weretiger’s subsequent bite attack automatically hits and the creature that has been pounced on must make a successful size-adjusted Paralysis saving throw or be knocked **prone**.\n\n###### Ecology\n\nWeretigers prefer to dwell in forests or jungles near human settlements. In the Sunset Kingdoms, weretigers are often considered avatars of the gods or rakshasa, and placated with offerings of food, wine, and treasure.\n\n###### Spoils\n\nA slain weretiger can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the following components useful in magic research:\n\n* blood (3 st, 180gp, *deflect ordinary weapons, skinchange*)\n* scalp (2 5/6 st, 170gp, *call of the great cats, silent step, transform beast*)\n\nBecause they revert to human form when slain, werertigers cannot be harvested for claws, fangs, or fur.\n\n![](data:image/png;base64...)\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Weretiger Primary Characteristics** | |\n| **Type:** | Enchanted Monstrosity (sapient) |\n| **Size:** | Large (50 st.) |\n| **Speed (land):** | 50’ / 150' |\n| **Armor Class:** | 6 (0) |\n| **Hit Dice:** | 5\\* |\n| **Attacks:** | 3 (2 claws, bite 6+) or 1 (weapon 6+) |\n| **Damage:** | 1d6 {S!} /1d6 {S!} / 2d6 {P!} or  by weapon +2 {W} |\n| **Save:** | F5 |\n| **Morale:** | +1 |\n| **Vision:** | Night Vision |\n| **Other Senses:** | Acute Hearing, Acute Olfaction |\n| **Proficiencies:** | Acrobatics 12+, Climbing 5+,  Listen. 14+, Swimming, Tracking 7+ |\n| **Normal Load:** | 30 st. |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Weretiger Secondary Characteristics** | |\n| **Expedition Speed:** | 30 miles |\n| **Supply Cost:** | 8gp (carnivorous) |\n| **Training Period:** | 1 month (sapient) |\n| **Training Modifier:** | None (sapient) |\n| **Battle Rating:** | 0.530 (individual), 32 (unit) |\n| **Lifespan:** | 0/2/13/18/38/57/76/95 |\n| **Reproduction:** | By infection or as human |\n| **Untrained Value:** | 350gp (A) / 215gp (J) /115gp (B) |\n| **Trained Value:** | 12,600gp |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Weretiger Encounter Set-Up** | |\n| **Lair:** | 15% |\n| **Dungeon Enc:** | Troop (1d4) / Lair (1d4) |\n| **Wilderness Enc:** | Troop (1d4) / Lair (1d4) |\n| **Alignment:** | Chaotic |\n| **Treasure Type:** | J |\n| **XP:** | 350 |\n\n",
