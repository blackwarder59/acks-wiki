  "markdown": "### Dolphin, Common\n\nCommon dolphins are small cetaceans that often reach a length of 8’ and weight of 350 lbs. They are found throughout the warmer seas and oceans of Cybele, include the Ammas Aurë, the Narrow Sea, and the Tehonaurë coast of Ulruk.\n\nAmong the most intelligent animals in the known world, dolphins are playful, curious creatures that have been known to aid drowning divers and cooperate with fishermen to drive fish into nets. They communicate through whistles with a complexity approaching true language.\n\n###### Combat\n\nHumans and demi-humans swimming in water gain a +2 reaction roll bonus when encountering dolphins. Mariners universally consider the sight of dolphins to be a **good omen** on a voyage, and with good reason. If a vessel encounters a pod of dolphins, all mariners and marines on board gain a +1 bonus to saving throws and swimming throws until the next day. (If the dolphins are called by magic, however, they do not grant the bonus – you can’t fake a good omen!)\n\nDolphins have **acute hearing** and gain +2 bonus to avoid surprise in their natural habitat. They also use **aquatic mechanoreception** to “see” in water up to 600’. Spells or effects that would ordinarily cause blindness do not affect the dolphin while it is using aquatic mechanoreception. However, creatures that are not in the water are invisible to them. Aquatic mechanoreception does not penetrate structures or terrain features.\n\nWhen forced to fight, dolphins prefer to start combat by **charging** into the enemy, dealing double damage dice (2d8) from their ram attack if successful. Subsequently the dolphin might bite its foe or use its Acrobatics proficiency to move past the opponent to line up another ram.\n\nThey are **exceptionally agile** (as Acrobatics 7+) in the water, and often outmaneuver predators such as sharks. They are also **prodigious leapers**; a dolphin that charges on its initiative can jump up to 20’ vertically and horizontally out of the water at any point in its movement. While often done just for play, dolphins in combat can leap over small vessels or even ram creatures on board.\n\nDolphins depend on their pod members for security against sharks and other threats, and can become nervous If encountered in or reduced to a pod of 5 or fewer, their morale score is reduced by 1.\n\n###### Ecology\n\nWhen a pod of dolphins is encountered, there is a 50% chance the adults will be accompanied by 2d6 juveniles and 2d6 babies. Juvenile dolphins have AC 3, Spd 210’, HD 1, and attack with 1 bite (1d3 {P}). Baby dolphins have AC 2, Spd 180’, HD 1/2, and attack with 1 bite (1 {P}).\n\n###### Spoils\n\nA slain dolphin with extraordinary characteristics can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following component useful in magic research:\n\n* tail fluke (3/6 st., 29gp, *leaping, swimming*)\n\n![](data:image/png;base64...)\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Common Dolphin Primary Characteristics** | |\n| **Type:** | Animal (wild) |\n| **Size:** | Man-sized (35 st.) |\n| **Speed (land):** | - |\n| **Speed (swim):** | 80’ / 240’ |\n| **Armor Class:** | 5 |\n| **Hit Dice:** | 2\\* |\n| **Attacks:** | 1 (bite or ram 9+) |\n| **Damage:** | 1d6 {P} or 1d8 {B} |\n| **Save:** | F1 |\n| **Morale:** | 0 |\n| **Vision:** | Night Vision |\n| **Other Senses:** | Acute Hearing, Aquatic Mechanoreception (600’) |\n| **Proficiencies:** | Acrobatics 7+, Navigation 3+ |\n| **Normal Load:** | 7 st. |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Common Dolphin Secondary Characteristics** | |\n| **Expedition Speed:** | 48 miles (water) |\n| **Supply Cost:** | 2gp (carnivorous) |\n| **Training Period:** | 1 month |\n| **Training Modifier:** | +3 (semi-sapient) |\n| **Battle Rating:** | 0.029 (individual), 3.5 (unit) |\n| **Lifespan:** | 0/2.5/5/12/24/36/48/60 |\n| **Reproduction:** | 1 calf every 2.5 years |\n| **Untrained Value:** | 35gp (A) / 80gp (J) / 35gp (B) |\n| **Trained Value:** | 375gp (hunter) |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Common Dolphin Statue Encounter Set-Up** | |\n| **Lair:** | None |\n| **Dungeon Enc:** | Pod (3d10) |\n| **Wilderness Enc:** | Pod (3d10) |\n| **Alignment:** | Lawful |\n| **Treasure Type:** | None |\n| **XP:** | 29 |\n\n",
