  "markdown": "### Gnome\n\nGnomes are a rare breed of demi-humans believed to be the outcome of dwarven and elven crossbreeding in the distant past. Standing 3' to 3’6” tall, they are of slighter build than dwarves, though noticeably bulkier than elves. Their skin color ranges from light tan to woody brown, while their hair is fair, eyes blue, noses large, and ears pointed. They make their homes in isolated hideaways and enclaves cultivated in forested hillsides or the woody feet of mountains.\n\nNeither as industrious as dwarves or artistic as elves, gnomes are nevertheless famous for their alchemical skill. The source of this skill, however, is hotly contested. The elves argue it is clearly due to their sylvan magical heritage, while the dwarves insist it is an outgrowth of traditional dwarven brew-craft. Gnomes are equally famous for their love of pranks, especially alchemical pranks. Many children’s fables warn of hapless victims temporarily besotted by donkeys or turned into mice after accepting “tasty cocktails” from gnomes.\n\nGnomes have a fierce hatred for kobolds and bitter dislike for goblins. Dwarves they treat as welcome relatives, an affection they awkwardly reciprocate. Elves see gnomes as something of a historical embarrassment, but gnomes continuously attempt to impress their aristocratic cousins.\n\n###### Combat\n\nGnomes encountered outside a gnomish hideaway or enclave will be groups or gatherings of grenadiers (1st level NPCs). The grenadiers will be equipped with chain mail, shields, short swords, arbalests, and 6 vials of military oil. All of the grenadiers will be **skilled warriors** with a +1 damage bonus.\n\n###### Ecology\n\nEach gnome group will be led by a maester with 6 AC, 2 HD, and 11 hp. Each gnome gathering will be led by an elder maester with 7 AC, 3 HD, and 20 hp.\n\nWhen gnomes are encountered in an enclave, they will be led by a grand maester with 7 AC, 5 HD, 22 hp, and a +2 damage bonus. As long as the grand maester is alive, the gnomes will gain a +2 bonus to morale rolls. The enclave will be protected by a militia (0th level troops) equal to 200% of the number of gnomish grenadiers. Gnomish militia have Spd 90’, AC 3, 1-1 HD, and ML 0. They are usually equipped with leather armor, shield, crossbow, short sword, and one flask of military oil. There is a 70% chance the enclave will be further protected by 2d4 trained giant shrews.\n\nAn enclave might also be home to various gnomish workers, noncombatants (disabled, elderly, or pregnant) and juveniles, to a maximum 850%, 850%, and 1200% of the number of warriors respectively. Workers have Spd 90’, AC 0, 1d4 hp, ML -2, and are equipped with short swords. Noncombatants and juveniles have Spd 60’, AC 0, 1 hp, ML -4, and do not fight. The grenadiers and militia will fight to the death to defend the noncombatants and juveniles.\n\nGnomish leaders should be assigned magic items using the ***ACKS II JJ***rules (p. XX). In addition, each will carry one random potion per HD.\n\n![](data:image/png;base64...)\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Gnome Primary Characteristics** | |\n| **Type:** | Humanoid (demi-human) |\n| **Size:** | Man-Sized (6 st.) |\n| **Speed (land):** | 20’ / 60’ |\n| **Armor Class:** | 5 |\n| **Hit Dice:** | 1 |\n| **Attacks:** | 1 (weapon 10+) |\n| **Damage:** | By weapon +1 {W} |\n| **Save:** | D1 |\n| **Morale:** | +1 |\n| **Vision:** | Standard |\n| **Other Senses:** | Standard |\n| **Proficiencies:** | Listening 14+, Searching 14+ |\n| **Normal Load:** | 4 st. |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Gnome Secondary Characteristics** | |\n| **Expedition Speed:** | 12 miles |\n| **Supply Cost:** | 0.5gp |\n| **Training Period:** | 1 month (sapient) |\n| **Training Modifier:** | None (sapient) |\n| **Battle Rating:** | 0.014 (individual), 1.5 (unit) |\n| **Lifespan:** | 0/3.5/15/26/63/96/136/175 |\n| **Untrained Value:** | 15gp (A) / 16gp (J) / 5gp (B) |\n| **Trained Value:** | 400gp (sapient) |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Gnome Encounter Set-Up** | |\n| **Lair:** | 50% |\n| **Dungeon Enc:** | Group (1d8) /  Hideaway (1 gathering) |\n| **Wilderness Enc:** | Gathering (1d10 groups) /  Enclave (1d10 gatherings) |\n| **Alignment:** | Neutral |\n| **Treasure Type:** | D (per gathering) |\n| **XP:** | 10 (warrior), 20 (maester), 50 (elder maester), 200 (grand maester) |\n\n###### Spoils\n\nA slain gnome can be harvested with Healing 1 for the following component:\n\n* liver (1/6 st, 10gp, any potions)\n\n",
