Their black carapaces are decorated with yellow stripes, the pattern somewhat resembling the hide of a tiger. Though they typically prey on other giant insects, giant tiger beetles can and do hunt and devour large mammals, including humanoids.\n\n###### Combat\n\nGiant tiger beetles have **terrestrial mechanoreception** enabling them to sense vibration in the ground over long distances equivalent to line of sight in full daylight. Spells or effects that would ordinarily cause blindness do not affect the beetle when its using terrestrial mechanoreception. However, creatures that are flying, levitating, or otherwise not touching the ground are invisible to the sense. Terrestrial mechanoreception can penetrate structures and terrain features.\n\nGiant tiger beetles are immensely strong even for beetles. In combat, they attack using their razor-sharp mandibles for deadly effect.\n\n###### Ecology\n\nWhen a nest of giant tiger beetles is encountered, there is a 7% chance per beetle that it will be incubating a clutch of 2d6 eggs. The eggs have 1 hp and weigh 2/6 st. Beetle larvae are rarely found in nests, because the larvae immediately disperse into the wild after they emerge from their eggs.\n\n###### Spoils\n\nA slain giant tiger beetle can be harvested with Animal Husbandry 2 for the following component:\n\n* chitinous spurs (1 stone, 65gp, armor +2, weapon +1)\n\nA giant tiger beetle's two largest mandibles fetch 6sp each.

The tunnels look to have been burrowed by a pony-sized animal, perhaps a giant weasel. The tunnels are each 10-30’ long, all terminating in a central 30’ square room occupied by **four giant tiger beetles**.

All of the remains are just bones, except for the gruesomely masticated cadaver of an explorer. The explorer’s backpack holds two bundles of weasel fur pelts (15gp, 3 st each).
