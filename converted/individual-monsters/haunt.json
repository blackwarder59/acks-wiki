Sometimes haunts arise when sapient creatures are violently slain in sinkholes of evil, which can trap souls and prevent their transmigration to other spheres. Other times haunts are created by greater undead such as wights or specters, whose enervating touch can leave a soul too weak to pass on to the afterlife.\n\nHowever it is made, a haunt looks much as it did just before its death, though it is weightless and slightly transparent. It can be easily recognized by those who knew the haunt in life, or have seen its face in paintings or statues. Whatever wounds claimed its life will always be visible on its ghostly body.\n\nHaunts remember their prior lives dimly, as if it were a dream. Though sapient, they do not form lasting memories based on their undead existence, living in an ephemeral eternal now.\n\n###### Combat\n\nEvery haunt is condemned to remain within 300’ of the place where it died until it is destroyed. For instance, a specter might enervate all of the residents of a hamlet, and its victims would thereafter linger as haunts in and around their hamlet.\n\nLeft undisturbed, haunts tend to re-play moments from their mortal lives, often the moment of their death. If disturbed, they will attack with their **haunting embrace**. Any creature embraced by the haunt must make a Paralysis saving throw. If the save succeeds, the creature suffers 1 {N!}damage. If the save fails the creature suffers 1 {N!} damage and is **faltering** until the end of its next initiative. However:\n\n* If already faltering, the creature suffers 1d3 {N!} damage and is **frightened** until the end of its next initiative.\n* If already frightened, the creature suffers 1d6 {N!} damage.\n\nHaunts are **immune** to enchantment effects, necrotic damage, poisonous damage, and all mundane damage. As **incorporeal** beings, natural and non-magical weapons always deal mundane damage against them, even if the creature would otherwise deal extraordinary damage. However, silver weapons deal extraordinary damage against them.\n\nHaunts created by violent death in a sinkhole of evil are automatically destroyed if their remains are found and cremated outside the sinkhole. Haunts created by enervation are automatically destroyed if their remains are found and cremated and the undead which created them is destroyed.\n\nThey are inherently evil for purposes of *discern evil*and *holy circle*spells and are rebuked as zombies. Rebuked haunts instantly vanish, returning only when the duration expires.\n\n###### Ecology\n\nHaunts can be encountered any place the chill of undeath has touched. It is not uncommon to find them haunting lonely mansions, remote lighthouses, and other places where isolated men and women might fall victim to undeath.\n\n![](data:image/png;base64...)\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Haunt Primary Characteristics** | |\n| **Type:** | Undead |\n| **Size:** | Man-sized (incorporeal) |\n| **Speed (land):** | 50’ / 150’ |\n| **Speed (fly):** | 100’ / 300’ |\n| **Armor Class:** | 2 |\n| **Hit Dice:** | 1\\* |\n| **Attacks:** | 1 (haunting embrace 10+) |\n| **Damage:** | Special |\n| **Save:** | F1 |\n| **Morale:** | NA |\n| **Vision:** | Lightless Vision (60’) |\n| **Other Senses:** | Standard |\n| **Proficiencies:** | None |\n| **Normal Load:** | None |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Haunt Secondary Characteristics** | |\n| **Expedition Speed:** | None (cannot exit lair) |\n| **Supply Cost:** | None |\n| **Training Period:** | Untrainable |\n| **Training Modifier:** | Untrainable |\n| **Battle Rating:** | 0.259 (individual), 31 (unit) |\n| **Lifespan:** | Indefinite |\n| **Reproduction:** | None |\n| **Untrained Value:** | 13gp (A) / - / - |\n| **Trained Value:** | 6,150gp (controlled) |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Haunt Encounter Set-Up** | |\n| **Lair:** | 100% |\n| **Dungeon Enc:** | Happening (1d8) |\n| **Wilderness Enc:** | Haunting (1d8 Happenings) |\n| **Alignment:** | Chaotic |\n| **Treasure Type:** | A (per happening) |\n| **XP:** | 13 |\n\n###### Spoils\n\nA destroyed haunt can be harvested with Alchemy 2 for the following component:\n\n* ectoplasm (1/6 st, 13gp, *deflect ordinary weapons, locate haunting, spiritwalk*)\n\n",
