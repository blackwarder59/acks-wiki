  "markdown": "### Beastman, Orc\n\nOrcs are grotesque beastmen bred as warriors from men and wild boars by the ancient Zaharans. They stand just over 6’ tall and weigh around 200 lbs, with pig-like faces, reddish eyes, black hair, and ochre to olive skin. Orcs prefer wearing vivid colors that many humans would consider unpleasant, such as blood red, mustard yellow, yellow-green, and deep purple. Orcs are exceedingly cruel, even by beastman standards, and delight in the torment and murder of others. They are also exceptionally greedy, which makes them particularly attractive to the chaotic rulers who hire orcs as mercenary soldiers.\n\n###### Combat\n\nUnless special troops are present (p. XX), 50% of gangs or warbands encountered will be archers (round up), 50% will be warriors (round down). Most orc warriors are equipped with leather armor, spear, short sword, and shield. Some orc tribes field warriors equipped with scale armor and pole arm. Most orc archers are equipped with scale armor, short bows, 20 arrows, and short sword. Some orc tribes field crossbowmen in lieu of archers, equipped with scale armor, crossbow, 20 bolts, and short sword.\n\n###### Ecology\n\nEach orc gang will be led by a champion with 4 AC, 1+1 HD, 8 hp, and a +1 damage bonus. Each orc warband will be led by a sub-chieftain with 5 AC, 2 HD, 12 hp, and a +1 damage bonus. An orc lair or village will be led by a chieftain with 6 AC, 4 HD, 20 hp, and a +2 damage bonus. As long as the chieftain is alive, the orcs will gain a +2 bonus to morale rolls.\n\nOrc lairs and villages will have drudges and whelps equal to 100% and 200% of the number of warriors respectively. Orc drudges fight as kobolds. Orc whelps have Spd 90’, AC 0, 1 hp, ML -4, and do not fight.\n\nWhen orcs are encountered in a village, certain additional creatures will be present. There is a 50% chance an orc village will be guarded by 1d4+1 ogres and a 60% chance it will be guarded by 2d4 giant boars. There is a 50% chance for 1d10 enslaved captives per warband. In addition, an orc village has a 75% chance of a shaman being present, and a 50% chance of a witch doctor. A shaman is equivalent to a sub-chieftain statistically, but has Shaman abilities at level 1d6. A witch doctor is equivalent to a champion statistically, but has Mage abilities at level 1d4.\n\n###### Spoils\n\nA slain orc can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 2 for the following component:\n\n* canine teeth (1/6 st, 10gp, *beguile humanoid*)\n\n![](data:image/png;base64...)\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Orc Primary Characteristics** | |\n| **Type:** | Humanoid Beastman |\n| **Size:** | Man-sized (20 st.) |\n| **Speed:** | 40’ / 120’ |\n| **Armor Class:** | 3 |\n| **Hit Dice:** | 1 |\n| **Attacks:** | 1 (weapon 10+) |\n| **Damage:** | By weapon |\n| **Save:** | F1 |\n| **Morale:** | 0 |\n| **Vision:** | Lightless Vision (30’) |\n| **Other Senses:** | Standard |\n| **Proficiencies:** | None |\n| **Normal Load:** | 7 st. |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Orc Secondary Characteristics** | |\n| **Expedition Speed:** | 24 miles |\n| **Supply Cost:** | 0.5gp |\n| **Training Period:** | 1 month (sapient) |\n| **Training Modifier:** | None (sapient) |\n| **Battle Rating:** | 0.009 – 0.205 (ind.), 1 – 12.5 (unit) |\n| **Lifespan:** | 0/1/12/16/30/45/60/75 |\n| **Reproduction:** | 1 whelp per year |\n| **Untrained Value:** | 58gp (A) / 16gp (J) / 12gp (B) |\n| **Trained Value:** | 225gp or more |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Orc Encounters** | |\n| **Lair:** | 35% |\n| **Dungeon Enc:** | Gang (2d4) / Lair (1 warband) |\n| **Wilderness Enc:** | Warband (2d6 gangs) / Village (1d10 warbands) |\n| **Alignment:** | Chaotic |\n| **Treasure Type:** | G (per warband) |\n| **XP:** | 10 (warrior), 15 (champion), 20 (sub-chieftain), 80 (chieftain) |\n\n",
