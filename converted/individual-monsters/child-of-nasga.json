  "markdown": "### Child of Nasga\n\nBeautiful yet alien, sensuous and wicked, the Children of Nasga are 20’ long snakes with silken black scales and androgynous human-like faces. They possess a cunning intellect and can speak both Ancient Zaharan and Ancient Thrassian. Devoted to Nasga, the Serpent, they are known to have served the most powerful cultists of that chthonic faith in ages past, or in some cases to have led Nasgan cults of their own.\n\n###### Combat\n\nThe Children of Nasga have **bewitching beauty.** Each creature that is beholding the Child at the start of its initiative must make a Spells saving throw. If the save fails, the creature is **bewitched** for 1 turn. If the save succeeds, the creature is not betwitched and cannot be effected again by any Child’s bewitching beauty for 1 turn.\n\nThe Children of Nasga have **venomous bites** that deal 1d4 {P!}damage. Any creature damaged by a Child’s bite must make a Death saving throw. If the save fails, the creature dies of poison 1d4+2 turns later. In addition, when a Child successfully bites a creature, it also constricts the creature for 2d8 {B!}damage and **restrains** it. If the Child misses its bite, it can separately attack by constriction. Once it has restrained a creature, the Child can automatically deal 2d8 [B!] damage on its initiative each round to the restrained creature without having to make an attack throw. Doing so counts as the Child’s constriction attack.\n\nAs a full-round action, a Child of Nasga can perform a sinuous and seductive **hypnotic dance.** Once begun, the dance continues until the start of the Child’s next initiative or until it is slain.Each creature that beholds the dance must make a Spells saving throw at the start of its initiative. Creatures bewitched by the Child save at a -4 penalty. If the save fails, the creature becomes **mesmerized** for 2d6 rounds. If the save succeeds, there is no effect. The Child cannot perform a hypnotic dance while restraining a creature.\n\nLike other Chaotic incarnations, Children of Nasga can be detected with *discern evil*, held at bay by *holy circle,* destroyed with *dispel evil*,and rebuked as infernals.\n\n###### Ecology\n\nWith the fall of the Zaharan Empire, most of the Children of Nasga were bound into great etched copper bowls sealed with magical runes and wax, there to await in slumber until the Awakening, when the Chthonic gods will call them forth to fulfill their dark purposes again. As such, they are only rarely encountered outside ancient temples and tombs.\n\n###### Spoils\n\nA slain child of Nasga can be harvested with Alchemy 2 for the following components useful in magic research:\n\n* golden eyes (11 4/6 st., 700gp, *bewitch monster, hypnotic sigil*)\n* fangs (10 st., 600gp, *poison*)\n* heart (10 st., 600gp, *torpor*)\n\n![](data:image/png;base64...)\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Child of Nasga** **Primary Characteristics** | |\n| **Type:** | Incarnation (demon) |\n| **Size:** | Large (20 st.) |\n| **Speed (land):** | 40’ / 120’ |\n| **Armor Class:** | 6 |\n| **Hit Dice:** | 8\\*\\*\\*\\* |\n| **Attacks:** | 2 (bite, constrict 3+) |\n| **Damage:** | 1d4 {P!} + poison/2d8 {B!} |\n| **Save:** | C8 |\n| **Morale:** | +4 |\n| **Vision:** | Lightless Vision (60’) |\n| **Other Senses:** | Standard |\n| **Proficiencies:** | Loremastery 11+, Theology 3+ |\n| **Normal Load:** | 13 st. |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Child of Nasga** **Secondary Characteristics** | |\n| **Expedition Speed:** | 24 miles |\n| **Supply Cost:** | None |\n| **Training Period:** | 1 month (sapient) |\n| **Training Modifier:** | None (sapient) |\n| **Battle Rating:** | 1.927 (individual), 115.5 (unit) |\n| **Lifespan:** | Indefinite |\n| **Reproduction:** | None |\n| **Untrained Value:** | 2,800gp (A) / - / - |\n| **Trained Value:** | 45,750gp (controlled) |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Child of Nasga** **Encounter Set-Up** | |\n| **Lair:** | 90% |\n| **Dungeon Enc:** | Solitary (1) |\n| **Wilderness Enc:** | Solitary (1) |\n| **Alignment:** | Chaotic |\n| **Treasure Type:** | N, D |\n| **XP:** | 2,600 |\n\n* pit organs (10 st, 600gp, *lightless vision*)\n* spine (10 st., 600gp, *choking grip, halt humanoid*)\n\nIf not used for magic research, a child of Nasga’s fangs fetch 4gp and weigh 1/6 st.
