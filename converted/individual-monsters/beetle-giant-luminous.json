These subterranean nocturnal insects are about 2 ½' in length and 75 lbs in weight and are named for the luminescent organs that adorn it, two on the head and one on the abdomen. The luminescent organs produce illumination within a 10' radius each.\n\n###### Combat\n\nGiant luminous beetles have **terrestrial mechanoreception** enabling them to sense vibration in the ground over long distances equivalent to line of sight in full daylight. Spells or effects that would ordinarily cause blindness do not affect the beetle when its using terrestrial mechanoreception. However, creatures that are flying, levitating, or otherwise not touching the ground are invisible to the sense. Terrestrial mechanoreception can penetrate structures and terrain features.\n\nThough not particularly aggressive, giant luminous beetles are immensely strong for their body weight. A single bite of their razor-sharp mandibles can slay an ordinary man.\n\n###### Ecology\n\nWhen a nest of luminous beetles is encountered, there is a 10% chance per beetle that it will be incubating a clutch of 2d6 eggs. The eggs have 1 hp and weigh 1/30 st.
