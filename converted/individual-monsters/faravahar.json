Some texts imply they have operated as messengers or prophets of the Empyrean gods in elder ages, and it is believed that those who are truly dedicated to Law will find them staunch allies and wise counsels.\n\nDepicted in ancient artwork as winged wise men, Faravahar are actually avian humanoids with owlish heads with colored feathers about the head and neck that give the impression of beards. An adult faravahar stand about 8’6” tall and weigh about 410 lbs. Faravahar coloring tends to bronze and gunmetal; rarely intruding into copper and silver, sometimes dyed into jewel tones. Their hind legs end in six talons, strong enough to clutch to sheer surfaces but nimble enough to wield tools and weapons. Their forearms and hands are dexterous but slender, used for delicate work.\n\nFaravahar speak their own ancient tongue, which resembles Proto-Danean, as well as Argollëan, Classical Auran, and Common.\n\n###### Combat\n\nFaravahar have **acute vision** and gain a +1 bonus to avoid surprise in their natural habitat. They can **cast arcane and divine spells** as Nobiran Wonderworkers of their HD. Blessed with **divine health**, they are immune to diseases, including magic diseases.\n\nBecause their forearms cannot wield weapons, faravahar prefer to fight from the air, attacking with their talons in melee, using their talons to fire crossbows at range, or blasting their foes with spells.
