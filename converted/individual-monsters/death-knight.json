In the closing days of the Empyrean War, it became clear that this stately tradition was under terrible threat. When great Suhgurim, prince of ruinguards, was felled at the fields of Morgot by his half-brother Valerian, even the sorcerer-king Sebek was forced to admit that defeat was at hand. Violating a millennium of tradition, Sebek ordered that Suhgurim and his other fallen ruinguards be raised as fearsome undead of a type never created before or since: death knights. To be made a death knight was to be doomed to an eternity of suffering. Bound forever into irremovable plate armor, denied all the pleasures of life, the death knights were also forbidden the peace of *torpor*. Instead, they were sent straight back onto the battlefields, undead juggernauts whose hatred for their own horrific existence was matched only by their enmity for the Empyrean crusaders who had destroyed their birthright.\n\nThe *Fourth Book of the Empyrean War,* part of the *Seven Radiant Scrolls,* claims that all of the death knights were destroyed when Zahar was sacked.
