  "markdown": "### Bear, Polar\n\nThese bears live in the freezing climates of Danae north of the Jutting Mountains. During very cold winters, polar bears have been known to cross the snowy passes and range across Jutland and Rorn. Polar bears average about 11' tall and can weigh as much as 1,400 lbs.\n\n###### Combat\n\nPolar bears are almost purely carnivorous and highly aggressive. All creatures suffer a -4 reaction roll penalty when encountering them.\n\nLike other bears, they have **acute olfaction** and gain a +1 bonus to avoid surprise in their natural habitat. They can track the scent of creatures for up to 6 miles with the equivalent of three ranks of Tracking proficiency. They are **adept at swimming** (as Swimming proficiency) and **surefooted on snow**, allowing them to ignore the movement penalties from Snowy conditions.\n\nIf a polar bear successfully attacks the same target with both claws in the same attack routine, it immediately **hugs** the target for an additional 2d8 {B} damage. If the hug kills the target, the bear can cleave with its claw.\n\n###### Ecology\n\nWhen polar bears are encountered in a wilderness den, there is a 66% chance the adults will be rearing bear cubs. Roll 1d4 for their age; 1-2, it’s 1d2+1 babies, 3-4 it’s 1d3-1 juveniles. Juvenile polar bears have AC 2, Spd 90’, HD 3+2, and attack with two claws (1d3 {S}) and bite (1d6 {S}). Baby cave bears have AC 1, Spd 90’, HD 2+1, and attack with two scritches (1 {S}) and one nibble (1d2 {P}).\n\n###### Spoils\n\nA slain polar bear with exceptional attributes can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) for the following components useful in magic research:\n\n* claws (4 stone, 240gp, *ice floe, ice sheet, iron maiden, swift sword*)\n* stomach (3 2/6 st, 200gp, *call of the wild bear, protection from temperature, slumber*)\n\nA polar bear's pelt fetches 200gp and weighs 3 4/6 st.\n\nPolar bears are rather more difficult to train than their smaller cousins.\n\n###### Encounter\n\nThe snow-blanketed landscape is pierced by a burrowed hole, about 4’ in diameter. Close inspection of the hole reveals icicles of blood and white hairs frozen along its edge. Lingering too long, or entering the hole itself, earns the ire of the **polar bear** within, which will aggressively charge the adventurers. Characters clambering into the hole will discover a 10’ long tunnel that terminates in a large burrow filled with bones.\n\nPolar bear: Spd 120’, AC 4, HD 7, hp 37, #AT 3 (2 claws/bite 4+), Dmg 1d8 {S} /1d8 {S} /2d6 {S} , Save F3, ML +1, AL N, XP 440; Special: hug (2d8 {B} if both claws strike in one round)\n\n![](data:image/png;base64...)\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Polar Bear Primary Characteristics** | |\n| **Type:** | Animal (wild) |\n| **Size:** | Large (140 st.) |\n| **Speed:** | 40’ / 120' |\n| **Armor Class:** | 4 |\n| **Hit Dice:** | 7 |\n| **Attacks:** | 3 (2 claws, bite 4+) |\n| **Damage:** | 1d8 {S} / 1d8 {S} / 2d6 {P} |\n| **Save:** | F3 |\n| **Morale:** | +1 |\n| **Vision:** | Night Vision |\n| **Other Senses:** | Acute Olfaction |\n| **Proficiencies:** | Swimming, Tracking 3+ |\n| **Normal Load:** | 45 st. |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Polar Bear Secondary Characteristics** | |\n| **Expedition Speed:** | 24 Miles |\n| **Supply Cost:** | 4gp |\n| **Training Period:** | 3 months |\n| **Training Modifier:** | +1 |\n| **Battle Rating:** | 0.190 (individual), 11.5 (unit) |\n| **Lifespan:** | 0/2/4/8/14/21/28/35 |\n| **Reproduction:** | 1d2+1 cubs every 3 years |\n| **Untrained Value:** | 3,000gp (A)/2,000gp (J)/1,000gp (B) |\n| **Trained Value:** | 5,000gp (war mount)  4,100gp (hunter) |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Polar Bear Encounters** | |\n| **Lair:** | 25% |\n| **Dungeon Enc:** | Solitary (1) / Den (1d2) |\n| **Wilderness Enc:** | Sloth (1d2) / Den (1d2) |\n| **Alignment:** | Neutral |\n| **Treasure Type:** | None |\n| **XP:** | 440 |\n\n",
