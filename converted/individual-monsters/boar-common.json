An ordinary wild boar is about 5’ long and weighs about 375 lbs.\n\n###### Combat\n\nCommon boars have **acute hearing** and **acute olfaction.** They gain a +2 bonus to avoid surprise in their natural habitat. They can track the scent of creatures for up to 4 miles with the equivalent of two ranks of Tracking proficiency.\n\nThough cantankerous, common boars do not generally attack man-sized creatures, unless defending their young. If they do attack, they use their great tusks to rend and gore their targets.\n\n###### Ecology\n\nWhen common boars are encountered in their den, the boars will be rearing 3d6-3 juvenile boars and 2d6-2 baby boars. Juvenile boars have AC 0, Spd 120’, HD 1+2, and attack with stubby tusks (1d3 {P}). Baby boars have AC -1, Spd 120’, HD 1, and attack with head butts (1{P}).\n\n###### Spoils\n\nA slain boar with exceptional attributes can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following component:\n\n* tusks (50gp, 5/6 st, *curse of the swine,* armor +1)\n\nIf not used for magic research, a wild boar’s two tusks fetch 1gp and weigh 1/6 st each.\n\n###### Lore\n\n*The traditional manner of cooking wild boar is as follows. First, the boar is flensed of hair and skin, then sponged clean. Next, it is sprinkled with coarse salt and roasted cumin. It is then left to stand overnight to enable the seasoning to flavor the meat.*\n\n*The following day, the boar is wrapped in sliced bacon or pork caul. Then it is placed within a brick oven, preferably fired with apple wood, which adds a sweet and fruity flavor to the game. The boar is then roasted for one hour per stone of weight.*\n\n*While the boar roasts, the sweet sauce is prepared. To begin, a pint of unmixed dry wine is boiled until only half remains. To this reduced wine are added 2 tablespoons of honey and a half-pint of sweet wine made from dried grapes. The admixture is then seasoned with pepper.*\n\n*When the boar is finished roasting, it is removed from the oven and glazed with the sweet sauce until the boar flesh has a caramel finish. Finally, the boar meat is carve into thin slices and served alongside any remaining sauce.*\n\n* Apicius*, On the Preparation of Feasts*\n\n![](data:image/png;base64...)\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Ordinary Boar Primary Characteristics** | |\n| **Type:** | Animal (domestic or wild) |\n| **Size:** | Man-Sized (38 st.) |\n| **Speed (land):** | 50’ / 150’ |\n| **Armor Class:** | 2 |\n| **Hit Dice:** | 3 |\n| **Attacks:** | 1 (tusk 8+) |\n| **Damage:** | 2d4 {P} |\n| **Save:** | F2 |\n| **Morale:** | +2 |\n| **Vision:** | Night Vision |\n| **Other Senses:** | Acute Hearing, Acute Olfaction |\n| **Proficiencies:** | Listening 8+, Tracking 7+ |\n| **Normal Load:** | 12 st. |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Ordinary Boar Secondary Characteristics** | |\n| **Expedition Speed:** | 30 miles |\n| **Supply Cost:** | 0.5gp |\n| **Training Period:** | 6 months |\n| **Training Modifier:** | -2 |\n| **Battle Rating:** | 0.028 (individual), 3.5 (unit) |\n| **Lifespan:** | 0/0.75/2/4/6/9/12/15 |\n| **Reproduction:** | 2d4 piglets every 6 months |\n| **Untrained Value:** | 4gp (A) / 1gp (J) / 0.75gp (B) |\n| **Trained Value:** | 240gp (hunter) |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Ordinary Boar Encounter Set-Up** | |\n| Lair: | 25% |\n| **Dungeon Enc:** | Sounder (1d4) / Den (1d6) |\n| **Wilderness Enc:** | Sounder (1d4) / Den (1d6) |\n| **Alignment:** | Neutral |\n| **Treasure Type:** | None |\n| **XP:** | 50 |\n\n",
