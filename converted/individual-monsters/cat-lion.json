They are found primarily in Kemesh, Opelenea, Shebatea, and southern Krysea and Somirea, as well as Ulruk south of the Great Waste. Lions are popular attractions at the arena and many are imported throughout the Auran Empire. Some later escape or are bought as guards or hunt animals, so lions often appear well outside their native habitats.\n\n###### Combat\n\nLions have **acute hearing** and **acute olfaction.** They gain a +2 bonus to avoid surprise in their natural habitat. They can track the scent of creatures for up to 4 miles with the equivalent of two ranks of Tracking proficiency.\n\nThey are **quite agile** (as Acrobatics proficiency at 12+) and **good climbers**, able to ascend sheer surfaces as if they were thieves (6+). Their **lightning reflexes** grant a +1 bonus to initiative. They are **naturally stealthy** when in their native habitat, and creatures encountering them suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls.\n\nIf a lion charges a creature or leaps over it (using Acrobatics), and successfully hits it with both claws, it immediately **pounces** onthe creature. The lion’s subsequent bite attack automatically hits and the creature that has been pounced on must make a successful size-adjusted Paralysis saving throw or be knocked **prone**.\n\n###### Ecology\n\nWhen lions are encountered in a wilderness den, the lions will be rearing 1d4 juvenile lions and 2d4 baby lions. Juvenile lions have AC 1, Spd 150’, HD 2+2, and attack with 2 claws (1d2 {S}) and a bite (1d4 {P}). Baby lions have AC 0, Spd 120’, HD 1+2, and attack with 2 scratches (1 {S}) and a bite (1d2 {P}).\n\n###### Spoils\n\nA slain lion with exceptional attributes can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following components useful in magic research:\n\n* heart (3 st, 175gp, *dominate beast, remove fear, silent step, swift sword*)\n* tongue (3 st, 175gp, *call of the great cats*)\n\nA lion’s pelt fetches 50gp and weighs 1 stone.\n\n###### Encounter\n\nRising from the scrubland is a thousand-year old baobab tree, 72’ tall and 33’ in diameter. Large grooves are cut into the tree’s wood, signs of territorial marking and claw sharpening. A hollow in its great trunk serves as the den of a pride of great cats, including **seven lions**, **two cubs** and **four** **baby cubs**.
