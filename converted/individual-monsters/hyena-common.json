  "markdown": "### Hyena, Common\n\nHyenas are pack hunters that rove the warm shrublands of Opelenea, Kemesh, Somirea, Shebatea, and Ulruk. They typically measure 4’ – 5.5’ in length and weigh 90 to 150lbs. They have huge skulls with powerfully-built jaws set on squat, bear-like bodies with short hind legs. Their fur is typically greyish-brown or yellowish-grey with irregular spots.\n\nWrongly despised as cowardly scavengers, hyenas are actually cunning predators capable of taking down wildebeests.\n\n###### Combat\n\nHyenas prefer to attack in packs and are more confident when their numbers are greater. If they do not outnumber their prey by at least 3:1, or if 50% of their number has been lost, their morale drops to -2.\n\nHyenas have incredibly powerful jaws that deliver **bone-breaking bites**. On an attack throw of an unmodified 20 , the creature bitten must make a Death saving throw. If the save succeeds, the creature suffers double the ordinary damage dice (2d8 {P}). If the save fails, the creature suffers triple the ordinary damage (3d8 {P}) and has a limb broken. Roll 1d6 to determine which limb is broken: 1-2 weapon hand, 3 weapon arm, 4-5 near leg, 6 far leg.\n\nA broken limb has the same game effect as a missing limb (***ACKS II RR***Permanent Wounds tables, p. XX – XX) until it heals. A broken limb heals after 180 days, or 90 days under treatment of a healer.\n\n###### Ecology\n\nHyenas organize themselves in large clans that can number as many as 90 animals. No more than 15-25 are typically encountered at once, however, as the hyenas are dispersed across a wide hunting range. When hyenas are encountered in their den, the adults will be rearing 1d3 juvenile hyenas and 1d2 baby hyenas. Juvenile hyenas have AC 1, Spd 120’, HD 1, and attack with 1 bite (1d3 {P}). Baby hyenas have AC 0, Spd 120’, HD 1-1, and attack with 1 bite (1 {P!}).\n\n###### Spoils\n\nHyenas mark their territory with a white, gooey cream known as hyena butter that they secrete from their rectum. The foul-smelling substance is sometimes collected by alchemist and shamans, as it can be used as a miscellaneous special component for magic research. There will be 1d4gp worth of hyena butter per hyena encountered.\n\nA slain hyena with exceptional attributes can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following component:\n\n* jawbone (3/6 st, 35gp, *dismember,* weapon +1)\n\nA hyena's hide fetches 12gp and weighs 2/6 st. A hyena’s fangs fetch 8gp and weigh 1/6 st.\n\nHyena are smart enough to be trained, but their foul temper makes it unpleasant to do so. Most trainers prefer to focus on more manageable beasts, such as war dogs.\n\n![](data:image/png;base64...)\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Common Hyena Primary Characteristics** | |\n| **Type:** | Animal (wild) |\n| **Size:** | Man-sized (12 st.) |\n| **Speed (land):** | 50’ / 150’ |\n| **Armor Class:** | 2 |\n| **Hit Dice:** | 2+1 |\n| **Attacks:** | 1 (bite 8+) |\n| **Damage:** | 1d8 {P} + bone-crush |\n| **Save:** | F1 |\n| **Morale:** | -1 |\n| **Vision:** | Night Vision |\n| **Other Senses:** | Standard |\n| **Proficiencies:** | None |\n| **Normal Load:** | 4 st. |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Common Hyena Secondary Characteristics** | |\n| **Expedition Speed:** | 30 miles |\n| **Supply Cost:** | 2gp (carnivorous) |\n| **Training Period:** | 3.5 months |\n| **Training Modifier:** | +1 |\n| **Battle Rating:** | 0.027 (individual), 3 (unit) |\n| **Lifespan:** | 0/1/3/6/12/16/19/24 |\n| **Reproduction:** | 1d3+1 cubs per 18 months |\n| **Untrained Value:** | 20gp (A) / 45gp (J) / 30gp (B) |\n| **Trained Value:** | 225gp (hunter) |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Common Hyena Encounter Set-Up** | |\n| **Lair:** | 25% |\n| **Dungeon Enc:** | Pack (1d4+1) / Den (5d6) |\n| **Wilderness Enc:** | Clan (5d6) / Den (5d6) |\n| **Alignment:** | Neutral |\n| **Treasure Type:** | Special |\n| **XP:** | 35 |\n\n",
