  "markdown": "### Beastman, Hobgoblin\n\nHobgoblins were cross-bred from goblins and men by the ancient Zaharans as elite shock troops during the Empyrean War. Standing well over 6’ tall and weighing around 215 lbs, they are much larger, stronger, and smarter than their diminutive cousins. Hobgoblins have dark orange or red-orange skin, with hair ranging from dark reddish-brown to dark gray. Hobgoblins’ eyes are yellowish or dark brown, while their teeth are yellow. Their garments tend to be brightly colored, often blood red with black-dyed leather.\n\n###### Combat\n\nHobgoblins are **formidable warriors** and receive a +1 damage bonus. They always keep their arms and armor in good repair and close at hand and are capable of fighting in well-ordered close formations such as maniples and phalanxes.\n\nUnless special troops are present (p. XX), 50% of gangs or warbands encountered will be archers (round up), 50% will be warriors (round down). Hobgoblin warriors are equipped with leather armor, spear, sword, and shield. Some hobgoblin tribes field warriors equipped with scale armor and pole arm. Hobgoblin archers are equipped with scale armor, composite bow, 20 arrows, and sword.\n\n###### Ecology\n\nEach hobgoblin gang will be led by a champion with 5 AC, 2 HD, 9 hp, and a +1 damage bonus. Each hobgoblin warband will be led by a sub-chieftain with 6 AC, 3 HD, 13 hp, and a +2 damage bonus. A hobgoblin lair or village will be led by a chieftain with 7 AC, 5 HD, 21 hp, and a +3 damage bonus. As long as the chieftain is alive, the hobgoblins will gain a +2 bonus to morale rolls.\n\nHobgoblin lairs and villages will have drudges and whelps equal to 100% and 200% of the number of warriors, respectively. Hobgoblin drudges fight as goblins. Hobgoblin whelps have Spd 60’, AC 0, 1 hp, ML -4, and do not fight.\n\nWhen hobgoblins are encountered in a village, certain additional creatures may be present. There is a 60% chance a hobgoblin village will be guarded by 2d6 trained cave gorillas. There is a 50% chance for 1d10 enslaved captives per warband. In addition, a hobgoblin village has a 90% chance to have a shaman present and a 75% chance of a witch doctor. A shaman is equivalent to a sub-chieftain statistically, but has Shaman abilities at level 1d8. A witch doctor is equivalent to a champion statistically, but has Mage abilities at level 1d6.\n\n###### Spoils\n\nA slain hobgoblin can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 2 for the following component:\n\n* canine teeth (1/6 st, 15gp, *beguile humanoid*)\n\n![](data:image/png;base64...)\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Hobgoblin Primary Characteristics** | |\n| **Type:** | Humanoid Beastman |\n| **Size:** | Man-sized (22 st.) |\n| **Speed:** | 30’ / 90’ |\n| **Armor Class:** | 3 |\n| **Hit Dice:** | 1+1 |\n| **Attacks:** | 1 (weapon 9+) |\n| **Damage:** | By weapon +1 |\n| **Save:** | F1 |\n| **Morale:** | 0 |\n| **Vision:** | Lightless Vision (30’) |\n| **Other Senses:** | Standard |\n| **Proficiencies:** | Manual of Arms |\n| **Normal Load:** | 7 st. |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Hobgoblin Secondary Characteristics** | |\n| **Expedition Speed:** | 18 miles |\n| **Supply Cost:** | 0.5gp |\n| **Training Period:** | 1 month (sapient) |\n| **Training Modifier:** | None (sapient) |\n| **Battle Rating:** | 0.028 – 0.155 (ind.), 2.5 – 9.5 (unit) |\n| **Lifespan:** | 0/1/12/16/30/45/60/75 |\n| **Reproduction:** | 1 whelp per year |\n| **Untrained Value:** | 55gp (A) / 16gp (J) / 12gp |\n| **Trained Value:** | 515gp or more (sapient) |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Hobgoblin Encounters** | |\n| **Lair:** | 25% |\n| **Dungeon Enc:** | Gang (1d6) / Lair (1 warband) |\n| **Wilderness Enc:** | Warband (1d8 gangs) /  Village (1d10 warbands) |\n| **Alignment:** | Chaotic |\n| **Treasure Type:** | E (per warband) |\n| **XP:** | 15 (warrior), 20 (champion), 50 (sub-chieftain), chieftain (200) |\n\n",
