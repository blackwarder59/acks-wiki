  "markdown": "### Beastman, Kobold\n\nKobolds are short, cowardly, and sadistic beastmen bred as pets from lizardmen and dogs by the ancient Zaharans to mock their former masters, the Thrassians. Standing 2’ to 2 ½’ tall and weighing about 40 lbs, kobold have scaly lizard-like skin ranging from dark rusty brown to a rusty black color, but an overall conformation that is vaguely dog-like. All have glowing red eyes with reptilian pupils. They dwell exclusively underground. They wear little more than ragged hides and scraps of leather armor, favoring red and orange colors.\n\n###### Combat\n\nKobolds are **weak warriors** and suffer a -1 damage penalty. Note that kobold champions, sub-chieftains, and chieftains do not suffer this penalty, and chieftains have a damage bonus (see below).\n\nUnless special troops are present (p. XX), 50% of gangs or warbands encountered will be archers (round up), 50% will be warriors (round down). Most kobolds warriors are equipped with hide armor, shield, 3 javelins, and either a spiked club or hand axe. Kobold archers are equipped with leather armor, short bows, 20 arrows, and either a spiked club or hand axe.\n\n###### Ecology\n\nEach kobold gang will be led by one champion with 3 AC, 1-1 HD, and 4 hp. Each kobold warband will be led by a sub-chieftain with 4 AC, 1 HD, and 8 hp. A kobold lair or village will be led by a chieftain with 5 AC, 2 HD, 12 hp, and a +1 damage bonus. As long as the chieftain is alive, the kobolds will gain a +2 bonus to morale rolls.\n\nKobold lairs and villages will have drudges and whelps equal to 100% and 100% of the number of warriors, respectively. Kobold drudges and whelps have Spd 45’, AC 0, 1 hp, ML -4, and do not fight.\n\nWhen kobolds are encountered in a village, certain additional creatures will be present. The chieftain will be defended by 5d4 guards (equivalent to champions statistically). There is a 60% chance a kobold village will be guarded 4d6 tokay gulls or 1d4 giant weasels. There is a 50% chance for 1d10 enslaved captives per warband. In addition, a kobold village has a 75% chance of a shaman being present, and a 50% chance of a witch doctor. A shaman is equivalent to a sub-chieftain statistically, but has Shaman abilities at level 1d6. A witch doctor is equivalent to a champion statistically, but has Mage abilities at level 1d4.\n\n###### Spoils\n\nA slain kobold can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 2 for the following component:\n\n* canine teeth (1/6 st, 5gp, *beguile humanoid*)\n\n![](data:image/png;base64...)\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Kobold Primary Characteristics** | |\n| **Type:** | Humanoid Beastman |\n| **Size:** | Small (4 st.) |\n| **Speed:** | 20’ / 60’ |\n| **Armor Class:** | 2 |\n| **Hit Dice:** | ½ (1d4 hp) |\n| **Attacks:** | 1 (weapon 12+) |\n| **Damage:** | By weapon -1 |\n| **Save:** | F0 |\n| **Morale:** | -2 |\n| **Vision:** | Lightless Vision (60’) |\n| **Other Senses:** | Standard |\n| **Proficiencies:** | Caving 11+ |\n| **Normal Load:** | 3 st. |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Kobold Secondary Characteristics** | |\n| **Expedition Speed:** | 12 miles |\n| **Supply Cost:** | 0.5gp |\n| **Training Period:** | 1 month (sapient) |\n| **Training Modifier:** | None (sapient) |\n| **Battle Rating:** | 0.004 (ind.), 0.5 (unit) |\n| **Lifespan:** | 0/0.66/8/11/20/30/40/50 |\n| **Reproduction:** | 1 whelp per 8 months |\n| **Untrained Value:** | 33gp (A) / 16gp (J) /12gp (B) |\n| **Trained Value:** | 105gp or more |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Kobold Encounters** | |\n| **Lair:** | 40% |\n| **Dungeon Enc:** | Gang (4d4) / Lair (1 warband) |\n| **Wilderness Enc:** | Warband (1d6 gangs) / Village (1d10 warbands) |\n| **Alignment:** | Chaotic |\n| **Treasure Type:** | E (per warband) |\n| **XP:** | 5 (warrior), 5 (champion), 10 (sub-chieftain), 20 (chieftain) |\n\n",
