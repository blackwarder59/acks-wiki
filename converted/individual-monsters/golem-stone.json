  "markdown": "### Golem, Stone\n\nStone golems are 10’ tall magical constructs made of granite, marble, or other statuary stone, weighing around 1 ton. Most stone golems are fastened to resemble kings or lords. Creating one involves the employment of mighty magic by exceptionally powerful clerics and mages.\n\nLike most constructs, stone golems have no true intelligence. The magic that animates them imbues them with just enough sapience to follow simple or standing orders from their creators.\n\n###### Combat\n\nWhen encountered, a stone golem’s reactions are always determined by its creator’s orders (even if given long, long ago).\n\nIn combat, stone golems smash foes with a powerful punch or large weapon. When armed with a large piercing or slashing weapon, stone golems deal **vicious blows** that inflict an additional 2 points of damage per hit. When armed with a large bludgeoning weapon, stone golems can **topple** man-sized or smaller creatures with every attack. A small or man-sized creature struck by a stone golem’s smash must make a size-adjusted Paralysis saving throw. If the save fails, the creature takes damage and is knocked **prone**. If the save succeeds, the creatures take damage but stays on its feet. The stone golem can cleave after a successful attack that topples its target.\n\nIn addition, on the first round of combat and every 5 rounds thereafter, a stone golem can breathe out a 10’ x 10’ x 10’ **cloud of heavy clogging dust.** Each creature within the area of effect must make a Poison saving throw or immediately become **queasy** for 2d6 rounds.\n\nStone golems are very hard to hurt. A stone golem is **immune** to enchantment effects, all mundane damage; and virtually all extraordinary damage except extraordinary seismic damage. *Disintegration, depetrification, earth’s mire,* and *earth’s hardening* have special effects:\n\n* *Disintegration* can destroy a stone golem.\n* *Depetrification* spell cannot harm a stone golem, but it automatically removes its immunity to damage until the start of the same initiative count on the following round.\n* *Earth’s mire* automatically causes a stone golem to become **queasy** for 2d6 rounds.\n* *Earth’s hardening* automatically restores all of a stone golem’s lost hit points.\n\nAs constructs, they count as enchanted creatures for purposes of spells such as *dispel evil*and *holy circle*.\n\n###### Ecology\n\nAs constructs, stone golems have no natural habitat. They can be found guarding ancient treasures, dwarven vaults, or places of power or serving powerful spellcasters.\n\n![](data:image/png;base64...)\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Stone Golem Primary Characteristics** | |\n| **Type:** | Construct |\n| **Size:** | Large (175 st.) |\n| **Speed (land):** | 20’ / 60’ |\n| **Armor Class:** | 5 |\n| **Hit Dice:** | 12\\*\\*\\* |\n| **Attacks:** | 1 (smash -1+) |\n| **Damage:** | 3d8 {W!} |\n| **Save:** | F6 |\n| **Morale:** | N/A |\n| **Vision:** | Lightless Vision (60’) |\n| **Other Senses:** | Standard |\n| **Proficiencies:** | None |\n| **Normal Load:** | 58 st. |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Stone Golem Secondary Characteristics** | |\n| **Expedition Speed:** | 12 miles |\n| **Supply Cost:** | None |\n| **Training Period:** | Untrainable |\n| **Training Modifier:** | Untrainable |\n| **Battle Rating:** | 1.529 (individual), 91.5 (unit) |\n| **Lifespan:** | Indefinite |\n| **Reproduction:** | None |\n| **Untrained Value:** | 3,900gp (A) / - / - |\n| **Trained Value:** | 36,000gp (controlled) |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Stone Golem Encounter Set-Up** | |\n| **Lair:** | 35% |\n| **Dungeon Enc:** | Solitary (1) |\n| **Wilderness Enc:** | Solitary (1) |\n| **Alignment:** | Neutral |\n| **Treasure Type:** | K, M |\n| **XP:** | 3,900 |\n\n###### Spoils\n\nA destroyed stone golem can be harvested with Magical Engineering for the following component:\n\n* stone head (65 st, 3900gp, *anti-magic sphere, earth’s mire, earth’s movement, energy invulnerability (all), giant strength, physical protection (all), protection from blast*, armor +2)\n\n",
