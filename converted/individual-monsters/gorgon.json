  "markdown": "### Gorgon\n\nAccording to Auran myth, the first gorgon was once Ianna’s most beloved bladedancer, Madosara (“golden sword”), renowned for her blonde locks and brazen blades. Though favored in all things by her goddess, Madosara sadly succumbed to Nasga’s blandishments and pursued forbidden ecstasies. When Ianna discovered the deceit, she transformed her wayward priestess into a form befitting her monstrous deeds – that of a statuesque golden-winged woman with writhing snakes for hair, brazen nails, and tusk-like fangs on a hideous face. Gorgons have adopted Draconic as their language. They typically also speak archaic versions of the local dialects.\n\n###### Combat\n\nA gorgon can attack with its brazen claws for 2d6 {S!} damage and its huge fangs for 4d6 {P!} damage. If a gorgon successfully bites a creature, the creature is immediately attacked by 1d6 **writhing vipers**. Each viper attacks at 9+ for 1d4 {P!} damage. A creature damaged by one or more of the viper’s bite must make a Death saving throw, with a -1 penalty per viper after the first. If the save fails, the creature dies of poison 1d4+2 turns later.\n\nIn lieu of attacking with its claws and bite, a gorgon can direct its **petrifying gaze** in in a cone 60' long and 30' wide in front of itself. Each creature within the cone that is beholding the gorgon must make a Paralysis saving throw. If the save succeeds, the creature is not affected. If the save fails, the creature is instantly **petrified**.\n\nGorgons are **immune** to poisonous damage and to mundane bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.\n\n###### Ecology\n\nGorgons prefer to dwell alone or in the company of others of their kind. They seem to favor ancient buildings of ruined grandeur that remind them of their lost beauty. They can have offspring with both human and elven men. All children of the union will resemble ordinary girls, but when they reach adolescence will transform into medusa over the course of 1d6 horrific days. Gorgons never raise their own children, abandoning them at orphanages or villages. New gorgons are born when a medusa lives to ancient age and metamorphizes (see p. XX).\n\n###### Spoils\n\nA slain gorgon can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the following components useful in magic research:\n\n* eyes (6 4/6 st., 400gp, *petrification*)\n* fangs (6 4/6 st, 400gp, *swift strike,* weapon +2)\n* serpentine locks (6 4/6 st., 400gp, *poison, staffs to snakes, snakes to staffs*)\n* wingtips (6 4/6 st., 400gp, *flight, winged flight*)\n\n![](data:image/png;base64...)\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Gorgon Primary Characteristics** | |\n| **Type:** | Monstrosity (sapient) |\n| **Size:** | Man-sized (20 st.) |\n| **Speed (land):** | 40’ / 120’ |\n| **Speed (fly):** | 40’ / 120’ |\n| **Armor Class:** | 8 |\n| **Hit Dice:** | 12\\*\\*\\* |\n| **Attacks:** | 3 or 1 (2 claws, 1 bite -1, or gaze) |\n| **Damage:** | 2d6 {S!} /2d6 {S!} /4d6 {P!} + poison or petrification |\n| **Save:** | F12 |\n| **Morale:** | +4 |\n| **Vision:** | Lightless Vision (60’) |\n| **Other Senses:** | Standard |\n| **Proficiencies:** | None |\n| **Normal Load:** | 10 st. |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Gorgon Secondary Characteristics** | |\n| **Expedition Speed:** | 48 miles (air) or 24 miles (land) |\n| **Supply Cost:** | 2gp (carnivorous) |\n| **Training Period:** | 1 month (sapient) |\n| **Training Modifier:** | None (sapient) |\n| **Battle Rating:** | 3.691 (individual), 443 (unit) |\n| **Lifespan:** | -/-/-/-/-/-/-/1000+ |\n| **Reproduction:** | 1 child per 2 years |\n| **Untrained Value:** | 76,775gp (A) / - / - |\n| **Trained Value:** | 87,275gp |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Gorgon Encounter Set-Up** | |\n| **Lair:** | 40% |\n| **Dungeon Enc:** | Solitary (1) / Sisterhood (1d4) |\n| **Wilderness Enc:** | Solitary (1) / Sisterhood (1d4) |\n| **Alignment:** | Chaotic |\n| **Treasure Type:** | R |\n| **XP:** | 3,900 |\n\nA gorgon’s head retains its ability to petrify creatures for 10 rounds after it is severed.
