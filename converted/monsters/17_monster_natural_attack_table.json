An ursine’s natural attacks are 2 claws and 1 bite. Its average damage per attack sequence should be around (8 x 2) 16 points. The Judge chooses 2 small claws (at 8 HD, these deal 1d6 points of damage each) and 1 small bite (at 8 HD, this deals 2d8 points of damage). The koalataur’s average damage per attack sequence is (3.5 + 3.5 + 9) 16 points.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: #2: The Judge is creating a 10 HD monstrosity with a scolopendrine body form called the chittering crawler. A scolopendrine’s natural attacks are 1 bite and 0-8 tentacles. Its average damage per attack sequence should be around (10 x 2) 20 points. The Judge first chooses 1 medium bite dealing 2d10 points of damage.

He opts for 6 tentacles dealing 1d2 points of damage each. The chittering crawler’s average damage per attack sequence is [11 + 6 x (1.5)] 20 points.</p>\n<h3>Monsters with Weapons</h3>\n<p>Some monsters may use weapons in lieu of or in addition to natural attacks. Monsters using a normal weapon such as a sword, battle axe, or mace inflict an average of 2.5 hp of damage plus 1 hp of damage per HD the monster possesses. The amount should be increased or decreased if the weapon is tiny or large. Extra damage dice can be granted in lieu of a damage bonus (e.g., grant +1d6 instead of +4 damage). Monsters using weapons can be given a fighter damage bonus based on their HD when using weapons.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: Orcs are 1 HD beastmen, so they do an average of (2.5 + 1) = 3.5 or 1d6 damage with weapons. Hobgoblins are 1+1 HD, but gain an additional fighter damage bonus of +1, so they deal 4.5 or 1d6+1 damage with weapons.</p>\n",

The chittering crawler’s average damage per attack sequence is [11 + 6 x (1.5)] 20 points.\n\n### Monsters with Weapons\n\nSome monsters may use weapons in lieu of or in addition to natural attacks. Monsters using a normal weapon such as a sword, battle axe, or mace inflict an average of 2.5 hp of damage plus 1 hp of damage per HD the monster possesses. The amount should be increased or decreased if the weapon is tiny or large. Extra damage dice can be granted in lieu of a damage bonus (e.g., grant +1d6 instead of +4 damage). Monsters using weapons can be given a fighter damage bonus based on their HD when using weapons.\n\nEXAMPLE: Orcs are 1 HD beastmen, so they do an average of (2.5 + 1) = 3.5 or 1d6 damage with weapons. Hobgoblins are 1+1 HD, but gain an additional fighter damage bonus of +1, so they deal 4.5 or 1d6+1 damage with weapons.\n"
