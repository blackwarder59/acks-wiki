The monster’s mass then determines its size category, as shown on the table below. A creature’s size category usually determines its height and length. Wingspans of flying creatures will typically be three times length. Creatures with light bones or long frames can be assigned a higher size category than their weight warrants; those made of heavy materials such as iron can be assigned a smaller size category than their weight (Judge’s discretion).</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Mass</strong></td>\n<td><strong>35 lbs</strong>  <strong>or less</strong></td>\n<td><strong>36 lbs to</strong>  <strong>400 lbs</strong></td>\n<td><strong>401 lbs to</strong>  <strong>2,000 lbs</strong></td>\n<td><strong>2,001 lbs to</strong>  <strong>8,000 lbs</strong></td>\n<td><strong>8,001 lbs to</strong>  <strong>32,000 lbs</strong></td>\n<td><strong>More than</strong>  <strong>32,000 lbs</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Size Category</td>\n<td>Small</td>\n<td>Man-Sized</td>\n<td>Large</td>\n<td>Huge</td>\n<td>Gigantic</td>\n<td>Colossal</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Length/Height</td>\n<td>Less than 2’ long/tall</td>\n<td>Less than 8’ long/tall</td>\n<td>8’ to 12’ long/tall</td>\n<td>12’ to 20’ long/tall</td>\n<td>20’ to 32’ long/tall</td>\n<td>32’ or more long/tall</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>AC Modifier</td>\n<td>+1</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>-1</td>\n<td>-2</td>\n<td>-4</td>\n<td>-8</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>EXAMPLE: The Judge is creating a 20 HD monster inspired by Shelob of Middle Earth fame. It has an arachnine body form with BME 1.68, so the monster weighs ((20*10)1.68) 7,340 lbs. That classifies the arachnine as huge size. The Judge notes the high CCF of 0.125. The monster’s carrying capacity is therefore (7,340 x 0.125) 918 stone – enough to wrap up and carry off an entire clan of meddlesome halflings.</p>\n<h3>Square-Cube Law (Optional)</h3>\n<p>In real life, animals are proportionately weaker the heavier they are, because strength increases with area (square) while weight increases with volume (cube). The ratio which governs strength and weight is known as the square-cube law. If you want to take into account the square-cube law’s effects on carrying capacity, find a creature of the same body form with a known weight to use as a baseline. Your new monster’s carrying capacity will be (baseline monster’s [CCF) x (new monster’s weight)] x [(new monster’s weight / baseline monster’s weight)2/3 / (new monster’s weight / baseline monster’s weight)]. This rule dramatically reduces the carrying capacity of larger monsters.</p>\n<p>We only recommend using this rule when creating new monsters that are one or more size categories larger than is typical for that body form. It’s not worth worrying about the square-cube law when dealing with weight variances like those of a panther and a lion, or an elephant and mammoth, but it will make a difference if you are creating a 20 HD 3,000 lb giant cat or 65-ton 36 HD elephant. In this book, we have generally used the square-cube law for real-world animals and giant humanoids. We have ignored it for other magical or imaginary monsters.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: The ersatz Shelob weighs 7,340 lbs. A giant tarantula weighs 500 lbs. Since the spider is in a larger size category than other monsters of its body form, the Judge decides to use the square-cube law. The huge new spider’s carrying capacity is therefore [(0.125) x (7,340)] x [(7,340/500)2/3 / (7,340/500)] = 375 stone.</p>\n<h3>AC Modifier</h3>\n<p>Armor class starts at 0 and increases with Hit Dice at a rate of 0.8 AC per HD for the first 9 HD. (Round the result to the nearest whole number, rounding 0.5 up if odd and down if even.) Additional HD thereafter do not increase AC. More massive monsters are, by virtue of size and bulk, easier to hit than smaller monsters. This is reflected with a modifier to armor class on the Monster Size Category table, above. Body forms may also provide a bonus or penalty to AC, as shown on the Monster Body Form table. AC may also vary by one point in either direction due to minor differences in agility, natural armor, etc. between species. Roll 1d6 or choose. 1-2: -1 AC; 3-4: +0 AC; 5-6: +1 AC.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE**:** The ersatz Shelob has 20 HD, but only the first 9 count for AC purposes, so it has a base AC of (0.8 x 9) 7.2, rounded to 7. As an arachnine, it has an AC modifier of +1. As a huge monster, the arachnine has an AC modifier of -2. Its final AC is (7 + 1 - 2) 6. The Judge decides his arachnine has a thick, spiky carapace, so he adjusts its AC by +1 to 7.</p>\n<h3>Unnaturally Tough Monsters</h3>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Monster Size and Hit Dice</strong></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Size</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Maximum Hit Dice</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Man-Sized or less</td>\n<td>9</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Large</td>\n<td>13</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Huge</td>\n<td>17</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Gigantic</td>\n<td>25</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Colossal</td>\n<td>40</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The rules for Hit Dice, body mass exponent, and weight assume a naturalistic progression of size, durability, and fighting power.

Normally, an 8 HD humanoid with BME 1.88 would weigh (8*10)1.88 = 3,782 lbs, so he must create an unnaturally tough monster. For the purposes of weight and size, he sets its HD at 1+2, yielding a 162-pound man-sized monster. For all other purposes its HD is 8. The Judge cannot make its HD 10 or more, because man-sized monstrosities cannot exceed 9 HD, even if unnaturally tough. (If the monster were an enchanted creature or undead it could possess 10, 15, or even 40 HD while still being man-sized.)</p>\n",
