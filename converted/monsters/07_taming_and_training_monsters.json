The following rules expand on the mechanics for Animal Training presented in the <em>ACKS</em> core rules.</p>\n<h3>Overview of Taming and Training</h3>\n<p><strong>Taming</strong> a monster teaches it submit to being handled without threatening or injuring its handler or the handler’s companions. <strong>Training</strong> a monster teaches it one or more <strong>tricks</strong>, such as responding to verbal commands. Taming and training monsters is performed by Animal Trainer specialists.</p>\n<p>Animals, vermin, and bestial or semi-sapient monstrosities must be tamed before they can be trained. Giants, humanoids, and sapient monstrosities cannot be tamed. They can voluntarily accept training, however. Usually sapient monsters would only need to be trained if they were to serve as mounts or war mounts. Constructs, incarnations, oozes, and undead can be neither tamed nor trained. The Taming and Training Monsters table lists all monsters which can be tamed and trained.</p>\n<p>Each monster has a <strong>training period</strong>. The training period for most monsters is one to three months, but exceptionally stupid or willful monsters may have a much longer training period. Ittakes one training period to initially tame a monster. It then takes one additional training period to teach a tame monster its first trick. (Sapient monsters which have voluntarily accepted training can proceed to learning tricks without needing to be tamed.). After a monster has learned its first trick, additional tricks can be taught in half a training period each. The training period for each creature is listed on the Taming and Training Monsters table.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: A war dog has a training period of one month. A juvenile war dog can be tamed in one month, taught its first trick in another month, and then learn another trick every two weeks thereafter. In contrast, a tiger has a training period of six months. It takes six months to tame a juvenile tiger, another six months to teach the juvenile tiger its first trick, and another three months for each subsequent trick.</p>\n<p>The training period assumes that the taming and training process begins when the monster is a baby or child. If the taming and training process begins when the monster is already an adult or adolescent, then the training period is increased. For adult domestic animals, the period is increased 4x for taming and 2x for each trick. For other adult monsters, the training period is increased to 12x taming and 6x for each trick.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: One day while out hunting in his forests, Marcus captures a grizzled old hunting dog, untrained and feral. He hands it off to the kennel master to be tamed and trained. A hunting dog has a training period of 1 month, so it will take (1 x 4) 4 months for the grizzled old cur to be tamed, and then (1 x 2) 2 months for it to learn its first trick. Each subsequent trick will take (1/2 x 1 x 2) 1 month to learn. You can, in fact, teach an old dog new tricks, it just takes longer!</p>\n<p>Normally, a monster can be taught a maximum of 2d4 different tricks (or 5 tricks +/- its INT modifier, if the optional <strong>Ability Scores for Monsters</strong> rules are being used). Some monsters are innately more or less trainable and have a <strong>trainability modifier</strong> applied to their maximum number of tricks. These are listed on the Taming and Training Monsters table. (The table shows that animals specifically bred for war are more alert and trainable than less well-bred specimens.) An animal trainer will learn the creature’s limit when he tames the creature.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: An elephant has a trainability modifier of +3. Even the dumbest elephant can learn 5 tricks, the average elephant can learn 8 tricks, and a very smart elephant can learn 11 tricks. In contrast, a giant centipede has a trainability modifier of -3. Even the smartest giant centipede can learn 5 tricks at most, putting it on par with the dumbest of elephants. An average giant centipede can only learn 2 tricks, and a truly stupid giant centipede couldn’t learn any tricks at all.</p>\n<h3>Animal Trainers</h3>\n<p>Taming and training monsters requires an animal trainer specialist or other character with the appropriate type of Animal Training proficiency. With one rank of Animal Training, the character can train domestic animals such as dogs, falcons, and horses. With two ranks, he can train wild animals such as bears and lions. With three ranks, he can train dire, giant or prehistoric animals such as cave bears or giant hawks. With four ranks, he can train monstrosities of bestial intelligence, such as griffons or owlbeasts, as well as vermin such as carrion horrors or giant black worms.</p>\n<p>A single trainer can train and manage up to six creatures at once as a dedicated activity. However, if a trainer works one-on-one with a particular creature for its entire course of training (a process sometimes called <strong>monster whispering</strong>), the creature’s maximum number of tricks is increased by two. Once a creature is tamed and trained, a trainer can control up to one mount or warmount, 6 workbeasts, 6 droving creatures, or 20 guard creatures at once. The trainer gains a +1 bonus to reaction rolls when approaching tame but uncontrolled animals of any type he can train.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Trainer Type</td>\n<td>Wage</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Domestic animal (Dog, hawk, horse, etc.)</td>\n<td>25gp/month</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Wild animal (Bear, cat, etc.)</td>\n<td>75gp/month</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Dire, giant, or prehistoric animal (any)</td>\n<td>150gp/month</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Monstrosity or vermin (any)</td>\n<td>250gp/month</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>Animal trainers cost between 25gp/month and 250gp/month to hire. Those able to train wild animals, giant animals, or monsters increasingly more expensive to hire. The Animal Trainer Wages table shows the average cost to hire different types of trainers. If a creature is of gigantic size or larger, its trainers cost a minimum of 150gp/month.</p>\n<p>In order to train mounts for combat (e.g., warhorses), a trainer must also be a marshal of the appropriate type. The character earns either his wages as an animal trainer or wages as a marshal, whichever is higher. In general, light cavalry marshals earn 60gp/month while heavy cavalry marshals earn 120gp/month. See <em>Domains at War: Campaigns</em> for more information on marshals.</p>\n<p>Flying creatures trained as adults require monster whispering, e.g., one trainer per creature. (Certain other particularly willful monsters also require monster whispering.)</p>\n<h3>Tricks</h3>\n<p>Tricks are tasks or activities that a monster has been trained to perform on command. Possible tricks include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Attack:</strong> The creature attacks apparent enemies. Its handler may point to a particular creature that he wishes the creature to attack, and it will comply if able.</li>\n<li><strong>Carry:</strong> The creature allows its handler to ride on its back.</li>\n<li><strong>Come:</strong> The creature comes to its handler, even if it normally would not do so.</li>\n<li><strong>Defend:</strong> The creature defends its handler (or is ready to defend its master if no threat is present), even without any command being given. Alternatively, its master can command the creature to defend a specific other character.</li>\n<li><strong>Down:</strong> The creature breaks off from combat or otherwise backs down. A creature that doesn’t know this trick continues to fight until it must flee (due to injury, a fear effect, or the like) or its opponent is defeated.</li>\n<li><strong>Fetch:</strong> The creature goes and gets something. If its handler does not point out a specific item, the creature fetches some random object.</li>\n<li><strong>Guard:</strong> The creature stays in place and prevents others from approaching.</li>\n<li><strong>Heel:</strong> The creature follows its handler closely, even to places where it normally wouldn’t go.</li>\n<li><strong>Perform:</strong> The creature performs a variety of simple tricks, such as sitting up, rolling over, roaring or barking, and so on.</li>\n<li><strong>Seek:</strong> The creature moves into an area and looks around for anything that is obviously alive or animate.</li>\n<li><strong>Stay:</strong> The creature stays in place, waiting for its handler to return. It does not challenge other creatures that come by, though it still defends itself if it needs to.</li>\n<li><strong>Track:</strong> The creature tracks the scent presented to it.</li>\n<li><strong>Work:</strong> The creature carries, pulls, or pushes more than its normal load.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A tamed and trained monster will perform its tricks for its trainer and for any additional <strong>handlers</strong> the trainer introduces to it. Handlers do not need to be proficient in the appropriate Animal Training proficiency, but if they are not they can only safely control one monster at a time. (Monsters trained to particular roles may be more easily handled, as described below).</p>\n<h3>Roles</h3>\n<p>Rather than teaching a monster individual tricks, its trainer can train it for a particular <strong>role</strong>. Essentially, a monster’s role represents a preselected set of known tricks that fit into a common scheme, such as guarding, hunting, or working. Each role counts as one or more tricks. A monster can be trained for only one role, and only for roles for which it can learn the required number of tricks. If the creature is capable of learning additional tricks (above and beyond those included in its role), it may do so when training for its role is completed.</p>\n<p><strong>Drovers (D):</strong> Drovers are trained to bring livestock together into a herd and move the herd from place to place. A proficient character (e.g., one with the appropriate Animal Training proficiency) can safely control up to six droving creatures, and an unproficient character can control only one. Drover training is exceptionally demanding, and counts as <strong>seven tricks</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Guards (G):</strong> Guards are trained to attack designated targets and defend designated characters or locations. Guards will accompany their handlers when requested, but loyally stay in place when their handlers are not present. A proficient character can safely control up to 20 guard creatures. An unproficient character can safely control up to 6 guard creatures, if an animal trainer has taught him the appropriate commands. Guard training increases a creature’s morale score (ML) by 2, to a maximum of +2, but it is highly demanding, equivalent to learning <strong>seven tricks</strong> from an animal trainer. Many creatures lack the intelligence or temperament to be guards – these are usually trained as hunters instead. (Some races have an affinity with certain creatures, and can train them as guards more easily. See p. XX for more details.).</p>\n<p><strong>Hunters (H):</strong> Hunters are trained to accompany their handlers on hunts, where they will track and kill designated targets. Unlike guard creatures, hunters require constant monitoring and discipline to ensure they stay under control. Therefore, a proficient character can safely control only six hunter creatures, and an unproficient character can control only one. Hunter training counts as learning only <strong>two tricks</strong>, so most animals of a carnivorous nature can be trained as hunters even if they are not suitable as guards.</p>\n<p><strong>Livestock (L):</strong> Livestock is trained to be easily herded by a shepherd, sheepdog, or similar. A proficient character or drover animal can safely control any number of livestock, provided they are part of the same social group (pack, herd, etc.). An unproficient character can safely control only one livestock. Livestock will not accept riders, pull loads, or carry burdens, and in battle or other stressful situations will tend to react according to their natural instincts (fleeing if a prey animal, or attacking if a predator). Domesticated herd animals can serve as livestock without taming or training. Otherwise, livestock training counts as learning <strong>one trick</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Mounts (M):</strong> Mounts are trained to carry a rider on their back and accept his directions. Mounts will not wear barding, and will not charge into melee unless facing natural predators. They will not attack with their natural weapons while carrying a rider. A proficient character (one with Adventuring, Animal Training, Beast Friendship, or Riding proficiency) can safely control a ridden mount outside of battle. If the character has Riding proficiency, he can control a ridden mount in battle; and outside of battle, he can control up to six mounts, one ridden and the others ponied on lead ropes. An unproficient character can safely control a mount on a lead rope, but cannot ride one without grave risk to himself (save versus Paralysis each round or fall off). Mount training counts as <strong>five tricks</strong>, so when dealing with less-intelligent beasts, suitable specimens might be rare and expensive. Note that even sapient creatures which are to carry riders must be trained as mounts, because the subtleties of communication between rider and mount, and of movement while laden with a rider, do not come naturally. A flying creature cannot be trained as a mount until it reaches adolescent age.</p>\n<p><strong>War Mounts (WM):</strong> War mounts are trained to carry a rider into battle and accept his directions despite the chaos around it. War mounts will wear barding, and will charge into melee, even if not naturally willing to do so. In melee, war mounts will attack their masters’ targets using their natural weapons. War mounts are subject to the same limits on control as mounts (see above). As with guard training, war mount training increases a creature’s morale score by 2, to a maximum of +2, and war mounts without riders can function as guard creatures. Training as a war mount is even more demanding than guard or mount training, counting as <strong>eight tricks</strong>. Very few animals have the intelligence and temperament to serve as war mounts, so they tend to be very expensive. Sapient creatures which are to carry troops into battle must receive war mount training. Unlike creatures of animal intelligence, their morale score is not increased by war mount training, however. A flying creature cannot be trained as a war mount until it reaches adolescent age.</p>\n<p><strong>Work Beast (WB):</strong> Work beasts are trained to pull heavy loads or carry burdens. Work beasts are not trained to accept a rider, and in battle or other stressful situations will tend to react according to their natural instincts (fleeing if a prey animal, or attacking if a predator). Teaching an animal to be a work beast counts as <strong>two tricks</strong>. A proficient character can safely control six work beasts, and an unproficient character can control only one.</p>\n<h3>Magic and Monster Training</h3>\n<p>When available, magic can be a powerful aid to monster training.</p>\n<h6>Animal Friendship</h6>\n<p>Whenever elves build fastnesses, all ordinary animals within 5 miles of the stronghold become kind and helpful to the elves. Such animals are always considered tame for the purposes of training by the elves who reside in the fastness.</p>\n<h6>Beast Friendship/Friend of Birds and Beasts</h6>\n<p>All animal henchman recruited with Beast Friendship are automatically considered tame towards the character for the purposes of training. Animal henchmen can be trained by the character, via monster whispering, for any role for which they possess sufficient intelligence (tricks); the character does not have to separately possess Animal Training to train his animal henchman. Because of his innate understanding of the language of beasts, a character with Beast Friendship always counts as proficient for purposes of handling trained animals in their roles.</p>\n<h6>Bewitch</h6>\n<p>The various <strong>bewitch</strong> spells are a great boon to animal trainers. As soon as a creature is <strong>bewitched</strong> it is immediately considered tame for the purposes of training by the spellcaster. An appropriate Animal Training proficiency is still required to train a <strong>bewitched</strong> creature, but such training will occur at child rates, even if the creature is already an adolescent or older. However, if the <strong>bewitchment’s</strong> duration ever expires (whether from <strong>dispel</strong> or a successful saving throw), the creature will revert to being wild until it is <strong>bewitched</strong> again. As always, a creature’s behavior when the spell ends will depend on how it was treated while <strong>bewitched</strong>.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: Llewyn, an elven animal trainer with Animal Training (bears), has captured an adult grizzly bear. He decides to train it as a hunter (2 tricks). Grizzly bears have a base training time of 3 months. Therefore, it will take Llewyn (1 x 3 x 6) 18 months to tame the adult bear, and another (1 x 3 x 2) + (1 x 3 x 2 x ½) 9 months train it, 27 months total. Although ageless, Llewyn is quite impatient, so he casts <em>bewitch beast</em>on the bear instead. It is immediately tamed, and he can now train it as if it were a child. Now it will take only (1 x 3) + (1 x ½ x 3) 4.5 months to train it! The downside, however, is that Llewyn will lose control of his bear if the bewitch ever expires.</p>\n<h6>Speak with Beasts</h6>\n<p>A character under the effects of <em>speak with beasts</em>always counts as proficient for the purposes of handling trained animals in their roles. He may handle a friendly but untrained animal in any role it is capable of fulfilling as if it were trained for the role. The character does not count as proficient in this case (unless he actually does possess the appropriate proficiency). He automatically counts as monster whispering when training animals he can speak with.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: Llewyn has stumbled upon an enormous stash of ivory hidden in a jungle temple. After bagging the ivory, Llewyn discovers it weighs 100 stone, well more than he can carry. Llewyn casts <em>bewitch beast</em>on a nearby rhinoceros (rendering it friendly), then <em>speak with beasts</em>.While the spells last, Llewyn can handle the rhinoceros as if he were an unproficient handler of a trained workbeast. This allows him to benefit from its 100-stone carrying capacity.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Training Race</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Affinity</strong></td>\n<td><strong>No Affinity</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Bugbear</td>\n<td>Cave Bears</td>\n<td>Dogs (all), Equines (all)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Centaur</td>\n<td>Equines (all), Herd Animals (all)</td>\n<td>Wolves (all)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Dwarf</td>\n<td>Bears (all)</td>\n<td>Camels</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Elf</td>\n<td>Cats (all), Dolphins, Raptors (all)</td>\n<td>None</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cyclops</td>\n<td>Herd Animals (all)</td>\n<td>Dogs (all), Equines (all)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Ettin</td>\n<td>Cave Bears</td>\n<td>Dogs (all), Equines (all)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Faerie, Brownie</td>\n<td>None</td>\n<td>Dogs (all), Equines (all)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Faerie, Knocker</td>\n<td>None</td>\n<td>Dogs (all), Equines (all)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Faerie, Nixie</td>\n<td>Giant Fish (all), Equines (all)</td>\n<td>Bears (all), Dogs (all)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Faerie, Piskie</td>\n<td>Dogs (all), Equines (all)</td>\n<td>Cats (all), Herd Animals</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Faerie, Pixie</td>\n<td>Giant Bats, Raptors (small, medium)</td>\n<td>Dogs (all), Equines (all)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Faerie, Redcap</td>\n<td>Giant Bats, Raptors (small, medium)</td>\n<td>Dogs (all), Equines (all)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Faerie, Spriggan</td>\n<td>Giant Bats, Raptors (small, medium)</td>\n<td>Dogs (all), Equines (all)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Faerie, Sprite</td>\n<td>Giant Bats, Raptors (small, medium)</td>\n<td>Dogs (all), Equines (all)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Giant, Hill</td>\n<td>Cave Bears, Dire Wolves</td>\n<td>Dogs (all), Equines (all)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Giant, Stone</td>\n<td>Cave Bears, Cave Gorillas</td>\n<td>Dogs (all), Equines (all)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Giant, Frost</td>\n<td>Dire Wolves, Polar Bears</td>\n<td>Dogs (all), Equines (all)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Giant, Fire</td>\n<td>Hellhounds, Hydras</td>\n<td>Dogs (all), Equines (all)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Gnome</td>\n<td>Giant Shrews</td>\n<td>Wolves (all)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Gnoll</td>\n<td>Hyenas (all)</td>\n<td>Dogs (all), Equines (all)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Goblin</td>\n<td>Dire Wolves, Giant Rats</td>\n<td>Dogs (all), Equines (all)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Halfling</td>\n<td>None</td>\n<td>Wolves (all)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Hobgoblin</td>\n<td>Cave Gorillas</td>\n<td>Dogs (all)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Kobold</td>\n<td>Giant Weasels, Tokay Gulls</td>\n<td>Dogs (all), Equines (all)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Lizardman</td>\n<td>Giant Lizards (all)</td>\n<td>Dogs (all), Equines (all)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Morlock</td>\n<td>Cave Gorillas</td>\n<td>Dogs (all), Equines (all)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Neanderthal</td>\n<td>Cave Gorillas</td>\n<td>Wolves (all)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Nymph, Dryad</td>\n<td>Giant Bees</td>\n<td>Dogs (all), Equines (all)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Nymph, Naiad</td>\n<td>Giant Fish (all)</td>\n<td>Raptors (all)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Nymph, Oread</td>\n<td>Raptors (all), Wolves (all)</td>\n<td>Dogs (all), Equines (all)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Orc</td>\n<td>Boars (all)</td>\n<td>Dogs (all), Equines (all)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Ogre</td>\n<td>Cave Bears</td>\n<td>Dogs (all), Equines (all)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Titan, Greater</td>\n<td>Giant Crabs, Giant Raptors, Griffons</td>\n<td>None</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Titan, Lesser</td>\n<td>Dire Wolves, Giant Raptors, Lions</td>\n<td>None</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Triton</td>\n<td>Devil Rays, Giant Crabs, Giant Fish (all)</td>\n<td>Land animals (all)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Troglodyte</td>\n<td>Giant Chameleons</td>\n<td>Dogs (all), Equines (all)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Troll</td>\n<td>None</td>\n<td>Dogs (all), Equines (all)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h3>Encounters with Tamed Monsters</h3>\n<p>Normally, a tamed and trained monster is introduced to a new handler by a character that already controls it. Sometimes this process breaks down – a trainer might be killed or quit before control is handed over, or a monster might be encountered “off the leash.”</p>\n<p>To determine how a tame but uncontrolled monster responds, make a reaction roll. Apply a +2 bonus if the character approaching it has the appropriate Animal Training proficiency. (Remember that characters with Beast Friendship or under the effects of <em>speak with beasts</em>always count as proficient for the purposes of handling trained animals*.*) If the reaction roll is 9 or higher, the character immediately becomes the animal’s handler.</p>\n<h3>Monster Taming and Training by Other Races</h3>\n<p>Mankind is not the only race to tame and train beasts to serve it. Dwarves, elves, giants, and beastmen of various sorts all rely on trained monsters. Just as each race has its own distinct physical and mental characteristics, so too does each race have certain monsters with which it has affinity, or lacks affinity, for training.</p>\n<p>The Monster Taming and Training by Race table lists the races and the creatures they have an affinity, or lack of an affinity, with. Feel free to add or subtract races and affinities to reflect your campaign setting.</p>\n<p>When a trainer has an affinity with a monster he is training, training it as a guard or war mount only counts as teaching it two tricks. This reflects the mutual bond that forms between the trainer and trainee.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: Kurk has just tamed a brown bear cub that he wants to train as a guard. He rolls 2d4 to see how many tricks the cub can learn, and scores a 5. A brown bear has a trainability modifier of +1, meaning the cub can only learn (5+1) 6 tricks. Guard training counts as seven tricks, so most trainers would not be able to train the cub. However, Kurk is a dwarf, so he has an affinity with brown bears. That means training the cub to be a guard will only count as teaching it two tricks. Kurk’s affinity for brown bears will also speed up the training time. Grizzly bears have a training period of 3 months, so, normally, training a tamed cub to be a guard would take [(3 months x 1 trick) + (3 months x 6/2 tricks)] 12 months. But Kurk will be able to train the cub to be a guard in [(3 months x 1 trick) + (3 months x ½ tricks)] 4.5 months.</p>\n<p>When a trainer has no affinity with a monster he is training, its base training period is doubled for all purposes. The morale of a trained monster is reduced by 2 points while handled by a creature with no affinity with it. Mounts will not accept riders who have no affinity for them (treat the rider as unproficient if he attempts to ride anyway). War mounts will accept riders who have no affinity for them, but function only as (non-war) mounts when doing so.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: Mulik, an orc chieftain, captures a baby mastiff (war dog) during a caravan raid. Mulik decides he would like to tame and train the puppy to be a guard dog. Normally it would take [(1 month) + (1 month x 1 trick) + (1 month x 6/2 tricks)] 5 months to tame and train the puppy, but it will take Mulik 10 months because orcs have no affinity with dogs. A war dog, when trained as a guard, normally has a morale score of +2, but Mulik’s war dog only has a morale score of 0. The puppy grows up into a mangy cur that has little love for its brutish master.</p>\n<h3>Monster Taming and Training Characteristics</h3>\n<h6>Diminutive</h6>\n<p>The name given to the creature’s young, e.g., pup for dire wolf or maggot for giant fly.</p>\n<h6>Weight</h6>\n<p>The average weight of the creature when full grown, in lbs. Adolescents weigh 75% of adult weight. Children weigh 25% to 75% of adult weight (50% on average). Babies weigh 5% to 25% of adult weight (15% on average). A clutch of eggs weigh 2.5% of adult weight in total (i.e. creatures that lay more eggs lay smaller eggs).</p>\n<h6>Size Category</h6>\n<p>The relative size of the creature – man-size (M), large (L), huge (H), gigantic (G), or colossal (C). A creature’s size category is determined by its length or height and its weight, as shown on the table below. If a creature’s height and weight place it in two different categories, weight is generally determinative. Flying creatures with particularly large wing spans on light frames are sometimes placed in one size category larger than their weight would indicate.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td></td>\n<td><strong>Man-Sized</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Large</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Huge</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Gigantic</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Colossal</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Length/Height</strong></td>\n<td>Less than 8’ long/tall</td>\n<td>8’ to 12’ long/tall</td>\n<td>12’ to 20’ long/tall</td>\n<td>20’ to 32’ long/tall</td>\n<td>32’ or more long/tall</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Weight</strong></td>\n<td>Up to 400 lbs</td>\n<td>401 to 2,000 lbs</td>\n<td>2,001 to 8,000 lbs</td>\n<td>8,001 to 32,000 lbs</td>\n<td>More than 32,000 lbs</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h6>Normal Load</h6>\n<p>Some creatures are valued primarily for their ability to carry equipment, supplies, or treasure. The figure listed is the <strong>normal load</strong> the creature can carry in stone. Most creatures can carry a maximum of twice their normal load. When carrying more than their normal load, their speed is reduced to half.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: A giant tiger beetle can carry its normal load of 250 stone at its full speed of 150’ per turn. It can carry up to 500 stone at 75’ per turn.</p>\n<p>Humanoids can endure heavier loads relative to their own size. Humanoids may carry their normal load at full movement. They may carry up to half again of their normal load at three-quarters movement. They may carry up to twice their normal load at half movement. They may carry up to four times their normal load at one-quarter movement.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: A cyclops can carry 90 stone at its full speed of 90’ per turn. It can carry up to 135 stone at 67’ per turn. It can carry up to 180 stone at 45’ per turn. It can carry up to 360 stone at 22’ per turn.</p>\n<h6>Lifespan</h6>\n<p>Lifespan indicates the ages at which a creature enters each age category, in the order Baby/Juvenile/Adolescent/Adult/Middle Aged/Old/Ancient/Maximum. All creatures enter the baby category at age 0, but the baby categories of oviparous creatures are designated with an E instead of 0 to indicate that the creature begins its life as an egg. Creatures with short lifespans tend to be more valuable as babies and juveniles, while creatures with long lifespans tend to be more valuable as adults.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: A griffin’s lifespan is designated E/0.25/0.5/3.3/22/33/44/55. A griffin begins as an egg when born; at 3 months (0.25 years) old it hatches into a child; at 6 months (0.5 years) it becomes an adolescent; at 3.3 years it becomes an adult; at 22 years it becomes middle aged; at 33 years it becomes old; at 44 years it becomes ancient; and at 55 years it reaches its maximum lifespan.</p>\n<h6>Role</h6>\n<p>Role indicates the type of training the creature would typically receive, including Drover (D), Guard (G), Hunter (H), livestock (L), mount (M), war mount (WM), or work beast (WB). Training is not applicable (N/A) to sapient creatures, unless they are typically used as mounts.</p>\n<h6>Trained Value</h6>\n<p>This column shows the typical market price in gold pieces at which a trained and tamed adolescent or adult creature could be bought or sold. Note that trained value varies by training. Guards and war mounts, being rare specimens, often command a premium.</p>\n<p>In most cases, trained creatures sell for much more than untrained creatures. However, some creatures’ trained value will simply be equal to their untrained adult value. This occurs when the creature is very difficult to manage, such that the cost of the creature handlers required to field the creatures simply does not justify training or using them. Such creature are essentially valuable only for their monster parts (p. XX – XX).</p>\n<p>Animals, constructs, oozes, vermin, and other creatures of less than sapient intelligence can be bought and sold as property in most realms. Creatures of sapient intelligence are generally only be bought and sold as property (slaves) in chaotic realms where slavery is permitted. Some Lawful realms permit criminals or prisoners of war to be sold into indentured servitude until they pay off their debt to society.</p>\n<p>Trained value also determines the wage that a creature can command as a mercenary, or that a controller can charge for controlling the creature on behalf of an employer. The wage equals the trained value/33. If the creature’s weekly supply cost is more than 0.5gp per month, reduce its wage by 4 x excess supply cost.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: A demonic attercop is a sapient monstrosity with a trained value of 93,500gp and a weekly supply cost of 48gp per month. A dark lord that wishes to hire a demonic attercop to undertake his evil schemes would have to pay (93,500 / 33) – (48 x 4) = 2,641gp per month.</p>\n<p><strong>Limits of Availability:</strong> For all transactions, apply the limits of the Equipment Availability by Market Class table. You can impose further limits depending on your setting. Just because a price is listed doesn’t mean the monster is available in every market everywhere.</p>\n<p><strong>Attributes:</strong> Monsters with high attributes are worth more. Each attribute of 13-15 adds 25% to the monster’s cost. Each attribute of 16-17 adds 100% to the monster’s cost. Each attribute of 18 adds 400% to the monster’s cost.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: Bucephalus is a medium warhorse fit for a world conqueror, with STR 18, INT 18, WIS 18, DEX 18, CON 18, and CHA 18. A typical medium warhorse costs 250gp. Bucephalus costs 250gp + (400% x 250gp) + (400% x 250gp) + (400% x 250gp) + (400% x 250gp) + (400% x 250gp) + (400% x 250gp) = 6,250gp. The historical Bucephalus cost 13 silver talents, which equates to 7,800gp, so ACKS is giving Alexander the Great a discount.</p>\n<p>Monsters with low attributes are worth less. Reduce the monster’s price by 15% for each ability score of 3, 10% for each ability score of 4-5, and 5% for each ability score of 6-8.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: Encephalitus is a medium warhorse fit for not much at all, with STR 3, INT 3, WIS 3, DEX 3, CON 3, and CHA 3. A typical medium warhorse costs 250gp. Encephalitus costs 250gp – [6 x (15% x 250gp)], or 25gp.</p>\n<h6>Adult/Juvenile/Baby Value</h6>\n<p>This column shows the typical market price in gold pieces at which an untamed, untrained creature of that age could be bought or sold. Adolescent creatures are priced as adults. Eggs are priced as babies.</p>\n<p>Untrained adults are usually worth much less than trained adults. Untrained sapient adults are essentially worthless except as slave labor or monster parts. Untrained adults of less-than-sapient intelligence can sometimes be valuable if they are readily trained and quite powerful.</p>\n<p>Juveniles and babies usually are worth more than untrained adults, but less than trained adults. Creatures that mature quickly are generally most valuable as juveniles or babies. At that age, they can be readily trained and then quickly put into service, owing to their short age-to-maturity. Creatures that mature slowly and/or are expensive to maintain are often captured as adults. The additional time and cost of training an adult (or of magically bewitching it) can be worthwhile if it will take a juvenile creature years to mature, during which it must be fed and cared for. Elephants, which take years to mature, were captured and trained as adults for this reason in our real world.</p>\n<p>Adult, juvenile, and baby value can be adjusted by high and low ability scores, as above. Availability is limited by market and setting, as with trained monsters.</p>\n<p>Note that dragons of each age category are purchased as adult creatures. There is no such thing as a “baby venerable dragon”; it’s a dragon spawn.</p>\n<h6>Supply Cost</h6>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Size</td>\n<td>Herbivore/Omnivore</td>\n<td>Carnivore</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Small or Man-Sized</td>\n<td>0.5</td>\n<td>2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Large</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>16</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Huge</td>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>48</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Gigantic</td>\n<td>48</td>\n<td>192</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Colossal</td>\n<td>240</td>\n<td>960</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The cost per week in gold pieces to supply an adult creature with adequate provisions. Carnivorous creatures cost more to supply than herbivorous ones, and big creatures cost more to supply than small ones, as shown on the adjoining table. Where creatures have been assigned a size category larger than their weight would otherwise indicate (due to, e.g. long frame, wings, etc.) supply cost is halved.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: With its 200’ wingspan, a giant roc is a colossal carnivore. However, based on its weight (15,000 lbs), it is merely gigantic. Therefore it is assigned a supply cost of 480gp, one-half that of a colossal carnivore by weight.</p>\n<p>Eggs, herbivorous creatures grazing on a pasture, and carnivorous creatures hunting on a range need not be supplied. Baby, juvenile, and adolescent creatures require less food; multiply the supply cost by the creature’s age as a percentage of its age upon entering adulthood. Round to the nearest 0.5gp. (This usually matters only if the adventurers have set up a program of monster breeding.)</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: An adult griffin has a supply cost of 16gp per week. A griffin enters adulthood at 3.3 years old. Therefore a 1-year-old griffin has a supply cost of (1/3.3) x (16) = 4.84gp per week, rounded to 5gp per week.</p>\n<p>Any time small or man-sized creatures are mounted on creatures of large size or more, just use mount’s supply cost rather than the total. This allows a unit of 60 ogres and a unit of 60 cavalry to maintain the same supply cost (4gp each) without fractional gp values.</p>\n<h6>Training Period</h6>\n<p>The number of months it takes to tame the creature, or teach the creature its first trick. Training period is determined by a creature’s sapience and temperament. If the value listed is “-“, then the creature cannot be trained.</p>\n<h6>Trainability Modifier (TM)</h6>\n<p>A modifier applied to the number of tricks the creature can learn, representing differences due to the species’ sapience and temperament. If the modifier listed is “S”, then the creature is sapient. Sapient creatures do not need to be trained unless they want to serve as mounts or war mounts, and are not limited to a number of tricks. If the value listed is “+3”, then the creature is semi-sapient. If the value listed is “-“, then the creature is mindless or otherwise cannot be trained.</p>\n<h3>Monster Taming and Training

      "level": 3,
      "html": "<p><strong>Taming</strong> a monster teaches it submit to being handled without threatening or injuring its handler or the handler’s companions. <strong>Training</strong> a monster teaches it one or more <strong>tricks</strong>, such as responding to verbal commands. Taming and training monsters is performed by Animal Trainer specialists.</p>\n<p>Animals, vermin, and bestial or semi-sapient monstrosities must be tamed before they can be trained. Giants, humanoids, and sapient monstrosities cannot be tamed. They can voluntarily accept training, however. Usually sapient monsters would only need to be trained if they were to serve as mounts or war mounts. Constructs, incarnations, oozes, and undead can be neither tamed nor trained. The Taming and Training Monsters table lists all monsters which can be tamed and trained.</p>\n<p>Each monster has a <strong>training period</strong>. The training period for most monsters is one to three months, but exceptionally stupid or willful monsters may have a much longer training period. Ittakes one training period to initially tame a monster. It then takes one additional training period to teach a tame monster its first trick. (Sapient monsters which have voluntarily accepted training can proceed to learning tricks without needing to be tamed.). After a monster has learned its first trick, additional tricks can be taught in half a training period each. The training period for each creature is listed on the Taming and Training Monsters table.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: A war dog has a training period of one month. A juvenile war dog can be tamed in one month, taught its first trick in another month, and then learn another trick every two weeks thereafter. In contrast, a tiger has a training period of six months. It takes six months to tame a juvenile tiger, another six months to teach the juvenile tiger its first trick, and another three months for each subsequent trick.</p>\n<p>The training period assumes that the taming and training process begins when the monster is a baby or child. If the taming and training process begins when the monster is already an adult or adolescent, then the training period is increased. For adult domestic animals, the period is increased 4x for taming and 2x for each trick. For other adult monsters, the training period is increased to 12x taming and 6x for each trick.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: One day while out hunting in his forests, Marcus captures a grizzled old hunting dog, untrained and feral. He hands it off to the kennel master to be tamed and trained. A hunting dog has a training period of 1 month, so it will take (1 x 4) 4 months for the grizzled old cur to be tamed, and then (1 x 2) 2 months for it to learn its first trick. Each subsequent trick will take (1/2 x 1 x 2) 1 month to learn. You can, in fact, teach an old dog new tricks, it just takes longer!</p>\n<p>Normally, a monster can be taught a maximum of 2d4 different tricks (or 5 tricks +/- its INT modifier, if the optional <strong>Ability Scores for Monsters</strong> rules are being used). Some monsters are innately more or less trainable and have a <strong>trainability modifier</strong> applied to their maximum number of tricks. These are listed on the Taming and Training Monsters table. (The table shows that animals specifically bred for war are more alert and trainable than less well-bred specimens.) An animal trainer will learn the creature’s limit when he tames the creature.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: An elephant has a trainability modifier of +3. Even the dumbest elephant can learn 5 tricks, the average elephant can learn 8 tricks, and a very smart elephant can learn 11 tricks. In contrast, a giant centipede has a trainability modifier of -3. Even the smartest giant centipede can learn 5 tricks at most, putting it on par with the dumbest of elephants. An average giant centipede can only learn 2 tricks, and a truly stupid giant centipede couldn’t learn any tricks at all.</p>\n"

      "html": "<p>Taming and training monsters requires an animal trainer specialist or other character with the appropriate type of Animal Training proficiency. With one rank of Animal Training, the character can train domestic animals such as dogs, falcons, and horses. With two ranks, he can train wild animals such as bears and lions. With three ranks, he can train dire, giant or prehistoric animals such as cave bears or giant hawks. With four ranks, he can train monstrosities of bestial intelligence, such as griffons or owlbeasts, as well as vermin such as carrion horrors or giant black worms.</p>\n<p>A single trainer can train and manage up to six creatures at once as a dedicated activity. However, if a trainer works one-on-one with a particular creature for its entire course of training (a process sometimes called <strong>monster whispering</strong>), the creature’s maximum number of tricks is increased by two. Once a creature is tamed and trained, a trainer can control up to one mount or warmount, 6 workbeasts, 6 droving creatures, or 20 guard creatures at once. The trainer gains a +1 bonus to reaction rolls when approaching tame but uncontrolled animals of any type he can train.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Trainer Type</td>\n<td>Wage</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Domestic animal (Dog, hawk, horse, etc.)</td>\n<td>25gp/month</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Wild animal (Bear, cat, etc.)</td>\n<td>75gp/month</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Dire, giant, or prehistoric animal (any)</td>\n<td>150gp/month</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Monstrosity or vermin (any)</td>\n<td>250gp/month</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>Animal trainers cost between 25gp/month and 250gp/month to hire. Those able to train wild animals, giant animals, or monsters increasingly more expensive to hire. The Animal Trainer Wages table shows the average cost to hire different types of trainers. If a creature is of gigantic size or larger, its trainers cost a minimum of 150gp/month.</p>\n<p>In order to train mounts for combat (e.g., warhorses), a trainer must also be a marshal of the appropriate type. The character earns either his wages as an animal trainer or wages as a marshal, whichever is higher. In general, light cavalry marshals earn 60gp/month while heavy cavalry marshals earn 120gp/month. See <em>Domains at War: Campaigns</em> for more information on marshals.</p>\n<p>Flying creatures trained as adults require monster whispering, e.g., one trainer per creature.

Its handler may point to a particular creature that he wishes the creature to attack, and it will comply if able.</li>\n<li><strong>Carry:</strong> The creature allows its handler to ride on its back.</li>\n<li><strong>Come:</strong> The creature comes to its handler, even if it normally would not do so.</li>\n<li><strong>Defend:</strong> The creature defends its handler (or is ready to defend its master if no threat is present), even without any command being given. Alternatively, its master can command the creature to defend a specific other character.</li>\n<li><strong>Down:</strong> The creature breaks off from combat or otherwise backs down. A creature that doesn’t know this trick continues to fight until it must flee (due to injury, a fear effect, or the like) or its opponent is defeated.</li>\n<li><strong>Fetch:</strong> The creature goes and gets something. If its handler does not point out a specific item, the creature fetches some random object.</li>\n<li><strong>Guard:</strong> The creature stays in place and prevents others from approaching.</li>\n<li><strong>Heel:</strong> The creature follows its handler closely, even to places where it normally wouldn’t go.</li>\n<li><strong>Perform:</strong> The creature performs a variety of simple tricks, such as sitting up, rolling over, roaring or barking, and so on.</li>\n<li><strong>Seek:</strong> The creature moves into an area and looks around for anything that is obviously alive or animate.</li>\n<li><strong>Stay:</strong> The creature stays in place, waiting for its handler to return. It does not challenge other creatures that come by, though it still defends itself if it needs to.</li>\n<li><strong>Track:</strong> The creature tracks the scent presented to it.</li>\n<li><strong>Work:</strong> The creature carries, pulls, or pushes more than its normal load.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A tamed and trained monster will perform its tricks for its trainer and for any additional <strong>handlers</strong> the trainer introduces to it. Handlers do not need to be proficient in the appropriate Animal Training proficiency, but if they are not they can only safely control one monster at a time.

      "title": "Roles",
      "level": 3,
      "html": "<p>Rather than teaching a monster individual tricks, its trainer can train it for a particular <strong>role</strong>. Essentially, a monster’s role represents a preselected set of known tricks that fit into a common scheme, such as guarding, hunting, or working. Each role counts as one or more tricks. A monster can be trained for only one role, and only for roles for which it can learn the required number of tricks. If the creature is capable of learning additional tricks (above and beyond those included in its role), it may do so when training for its role is completed.</p>\n<p><strong>Drovers (D):</strong> Drovers are trained to bring livestock together into a herd and move the herd from place to place. A proficient character (e.g., one with the appropriate Animal Training proficiency) can safely control up to six droving creatures, and an unproficient character can control only one. Drover training is exceptionally demanding, and counts as <strong>seven tricks</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Guards (G):</strong> Guards are trained to attack designated targets and defend designated characters or locations. Guards will accompany their handlers when requested, but loyally stay in place when their handlers are not present. A proficient character can safely control up to 20 guard creatures. An unproficient character can safely control up to 6 guard creatures, if an animal trainer has taught him the appropriate commands. Guard training increases a creature’s morale score (ML) by 2, to a maximum of +2, but it is highly demanding, equivalent to learning <strong>seven tricks</strong> from an animal trainer. Many creatures lack the intelligence or temperament to be guards – these are usually trained as hunters instead. (Some races have an affinity with certain creatures, and can train them as guards more easily. See p. XX for more details.).</p>\n<p><strong>Hunters (H):</strong> Hunters are trained to accompany their handlers on hunts, where they will track and kill designated targets. Unlike guard creatures, hunters require constant monitoring and discipline to ensure they stay under control. Therefore, a proficient character can safely control only six hunter creatures, and an unproficient character can control only one. Hunter training counts as learning only <strong>two tricks</strong>, so most animals of a carnivorous nature can be trained as hunters even if they are not suitable as guards.</p>\n<p><strong>Livestock (L):</strong> Livestock is trained to be easily herded by a shepherd, sheepdog, or similar. A proficient character or drover animal can safely control any number of livestock, provided they are part of the same social group (pack, herd, etc.). An unproficient character can safely control only one livestock. Livestock will not accept riders, pull loads, or carry burdens, and in battle or other stressful situations will tend to react according to their natural instincts (fleeing if a prey animal, or attacking if a predator). Domesticated herd animals can serve as livestock without taming or training. Otherwise, livestock training counts as learning <strong>one trick</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Mounts (M):</strong> Mounts are trained to carry a rider on their back and accept his directions. Mounts will not wear barding, and will not charge into melee unless facing natural predators. They will not attack with their natural weapons while carrying a rider. A proficient character (one with Adventuring, Animal Training, Beast Friendship, or Riding proficiency) can safely control a ridden mount outside of battle. If the character has Riding proficiency, he can control a ridden mount in battle; and outside of battle, he can control up to six mounts, one ridden and the others ponied on lead ropes. An unproficient character can safely control a mount on a lead rope, but cannot ride one without grave risk to himself (save versus Paralysis each round or fall off). Mount training counts as <strong>five tricks</strong>, so when dealing with less-intelligent beasts, suitable specimens might be rare and expensive. Note that even sapient creatures which are to carry riders must be trained as mounts, because the subtleties of communication between rider and mount, and of movement while laden with a rider, do not come naturally. A flying creature cannot be trained as a mount until it reaches adolescent age.</p>\n<p><strong>War Mounts (WM):</strong> War mounts are trained to carry a rider into battle and accept his directions despite the chaos around it. War mounts will wear barding, and will charge into melee, even if not naturally willing to do so. In melee, war mounts will attack their masters’ targets using their natural weapons. War mounts are subject to the same limits on control as mounts (see above). As with guard training, war mount training increases a creature’s morale score by 2, to a maximum of +2, and war mounts without riders can function as guard creatures. Training as a war mount is even more demanding than guard or mount training, counting as <strong>eight tricks</strong>. Very few animals have the intelligence and temperament to serve as war mounts, so they tend to be very expensive. Sapient creatures which are to carry troops into battle must receive war mount training. Unlike creatures of animal intelligence, their morale score is not increased by war mount training, however. A flying creature cannot be trained as a war mount until it reaches adolescent age.</p>\n<p><strong>Work Beast (WB):</strong> Work beasts are trained to pull heavy loads or carry burdens. Work beasts are not trained to accept a rider, and in battle or other stressful situations will tend to react according to their natural instincts (fleeing if a prey animal, or attacking if a predator). Teaching an animal to be a work beast counts as <strong>two tricks</strong>. A proficient character can safely control six work beasts, and an unproficient character can control only one.</p>\n"

However, if the <strong>bewitchment’s</strong> duration ever expires (whether from <strong>dispel</strong> or a successful saving throw), the creature will revert to being wild until it is <strong>bewitched</strong> again. As always, a creature’s behavior when the spell ends will depend on how it was treated while <strong>bewitched</strong>.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: Llewyn, an elven animal trainer with Animal Training (bears), has captured an adult grizzly bear. He decides to train it as a hunter (2 tricks). Grizzly bears have a base training time of 3 months. Therefore, it will take Llewyn (1 x 3 x 6) 18 months to tame the adult bear, and another (1 x 3 x 2) + (1 x 3 x 2 x ½) 9 months train it, 27 months total. Although ageless, Llewyn is quite impatient, so he casts <em>bewitch beast</em>on the bear instead. It is immediately tamed, and he can now train it as if it were a child. Now it will take only (1 x 3) + (1 x ½ x 3) 4.5 months to train it! The downside, however, is that Llewyn will lose control of his bear if the bewitch ever expires.</p>\n"

Just as each race has its own distinct physical and mental characteristics, so too does each race have certain monsters with which it has affinity, or lacks affinity, for training.</p>\n<p>The Monster Taming and Training by Race table lists the races and the creatures they have an affinity, or lack of an affinity, with. Feel free to add or subtract races and affinities to reflect your campaign setting.</p>\n<p>When a trainer has an affinity with a monster he is training, training it as a guard or war mount only counts as teaching it two tricks. This reflects the mutual bond that forms between the trainer and trainee.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: Kurk has just tamed a brown bear cub that he wants to train as a guard. He rolls 2d4 to see how many tricks the cub can learn, and scores a 5. A brown bear has a trainability modifier of +1, meaning the cub can only learn (5+1) 6 tricks. Guard training counts as seven tricks, so most trainers would not be able to train the cub. However, Kurk is a dwarf, so he has an affinity with brown bears. That means training the cub to be a guard will only count as teaching it two tricks. Kurk’s affinity for brown bears will also speed up the training time. Grizzly bears have a training period of 3 months, so, normally, training a tamed cub to be a guard would take [(3 months x 1 trick) + (3 months x 6/2 tricks)] 12 months. But Kurk will be able to train the cub to be a guard in [(3 months x 1 trick) + (3 months x ½ tricks)] 4.5 months.</p>\n<p>When a trainer has no affinity with a monster he is training, its base training period is doubled for all purposes. The morale of a trained monster is reduced by 2 points while handled by a creature with no affinity with it. Mounts will not accept riders who have no affinity for them (treat the rider as unproficient if he attempts to ride anyway). War mounts will accept riders who have no affinity for them, but function only as (non-war) mounts when doing so.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: Mulik, an orc chieftain, captures a baby mastiff (war dog) during a caravan raid. Mulik decides he would like to tame and train the puppy to be a guard dog. Normally it would take [(1 month) + (1 month x 1 trick) + (1 month x 6/2 tricks)] 5 months to tame and train the puppy, but it will take Mulik 10 months because orcs have no affinity with dogs. A war dog, when trained as a guard, normally has a morale score of +2, but Mulik’s war dog only has a morale score of 0. The puppy grows up into a mangy cur that has little love for its brutish master.</p>\n"

Carnivorous creatures cost more to supply than herbivorous ones, and big creatures cost more to supply than small ones, as shown on the adjoining table. Where creatures have been assigned a size category larger than their weight would otherwise indicate (due to, e.g. long frame, wings, etc.) supply cost is halved.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: With its 200’ wingspan, a giant roc is a colossal carnivore. However, based on its weight (15,000 lbs), it is merely gigantic. Therefore it is assigned a supply cost of 480gp, one-half that of a colossal carnivore by weight.</p>\n<p>Eggs, herbivorous creatures grazing on a pasture, and carnivorous creatures hunting on a range need not be supplied. Baby, juvenile, and adolescent creatures require less food; multiply the supply cost by the creature’s age as a percentage of its age upon entering adulthood. Round to the nearest 0.5gp. (This usually matters only if the adventurers have set up a program of monster breeding.)</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: An adult griffin has a supply cost of 16gp per week. A griffin enters adulthood at 3.3 years old. Therefore a 1-year-old griffin has a supply cost of (1/3.3) x (16) = 4.84gp per week, rounded to 5gp per week.</p>\n<p>Any time small or man-sized creatures are mounted on creatures of large size or more, just use mount’s supply cost rather than the total. This allows a unit of 60 ogres and a unit of 60 cavalry to maintain the same supply cost (4gp each) without fractional gp values.</p>\n"

  "rawMarkdown": "## Taming and Training Monsters\n\nCharacters who capture monsters might be able to tame and train them, or sell them to NPCs interested in doing so. The following rules expand on the mechanics for Animal Training presented in the *ACKS* core rules.\n\n### Overview of Taming and Training\n\n**Taming** a monster teaches it submit to being handled without threatening or injuring its handler or the handler’s companions. **Training** a monster teaches it one or more **tricks**, such as responding to verbal commands. Taming and training monsters is performed by Animal Trainer specialists.\n\nAnimals, vermin, and bestial or semi-sapient monstrosities must be tamed before they can be trained. Giants, humanoids, and sapient monstrosities cannot be tamed. They can voluntarily accept training, however. Usually sapient monsters would only need to be trained if they were to serve as mounts or war mounts. Constructs, incarnations, oozes, and undead can be neither tamed nor trained. The Taming and Training Monsters table lists all monsters which can be tamed and trained.\n\nEach monster has a **training period**. The training period for most monsters is one to three months, but exceptionally stupid or willful monsters may have a much longer training period. Ittakes one training period to initially tame a monster. It then takes one additional training period to teach a tame monster its first trick. (Sapient monsters which have voluntarily accepted training can proceed to learning tricks without needing to be tamed.). After a monster has learned its first trick, additional tricks can be taught in half a training period each. The training period for each creature is listed on the Taming and Training Monsters table.\n\nEXAMPLE: A war dog has a training period of one month. A juvenile war dog can be tamed in one month, taught its first trick in another month, and then learn another trick every two weeks thereafter. In contrast, a tiger has a training period of six months. It takes six months to tame a juvenile tiger, another six months to teach the juvenile tiger its first trick, and another three months for each subsequent trick.\n\nThe training period assumes that the taming and training process begins when the monster is a baby or child. If the taming and training process begins when the monster is already an adult or adolescent, then the training period is increased. For adult domestic animals, the period is increased 4x for taming and 2x for each trick. For other adult monsters, the training period is increased to 12x taming and 6x for each trick.\n\nEXAMPLE: One day while out hunting in his forests, Marcus captures a grizzled old hunting dog, untrained and feral. He hands it off to the kennel master to be tamed and trained. A hunting dog has a training period of 1 month, so it will take (1 x 4) 4 months for the grizzled old cur to be tamed, and then (1 x 2) 2 months for it to learn its first trick. Each subsequent trick will take (1/2 x 1 x 2) 1 month to learn. You can, in fact, teach an old dog new tricks, it just takes longer!\n\nNormally, a monster can be taught a maximum of 2d4 different tricks (or 5 tricks +/- its INT modifier, if the optional **Ability Scores for Monsters** rules are being used). Some monsters are innately more or less trainable and have a **trainability modifier** applied to their maximum number of tricks. These are listed on the Taming and Training Monsters table. (The table shows that animals specifically bred for war are more alert and trainable than less well-bred specimens.) An animal trainer will learn the creature’s limit when he tames the creature.\n\nEXAMPLE: An elephant has a trainability modifier of +3. Even the dumbest elephant can learn 5 tricks, the average elephant can learn 8 tricks, and a very smart elephant can learn 11 tricks. In contrast, a giant centipede has a trainability modifier of -3. Even the smartest giant centipede can learn 5 tricks at most, putting it on par with the dumbest of elephants. An average giant centipede can only learn 2 tricks, and a truly stupid giant centipede couldn’t learn any tricks at all.\n\n### Animal Trainers\n\nTaming and training monsters requires an animal trainer specialist or other character with the appropriate type of Animal Training proficiency. With one rank of Animal Training, the character can train domestic animals such as dogs, falcons, and horses. With two ranks, he can train wild animals such as bears and lions. With three ranks, he can train dire, giant or prehistoric animals such as cave bears or giant hawks. With four ranks, he can train monstrosities of bestial intelligence, such as griffons or owlbeasts, as well as vermin such as carrion horrors or giant black worms.\n\nA single trainer can train and manage up to six creatures at once as a dedicated activity. However, if a trainer works one-on-one with a particular creature for its entire course of training (a process sometimes called **monster whispering**), the creature’s maximum number of tricks is increased by two. Once a creature is tamed and trained, a trainer can control up to one mount or warmount, 6 workbeasts, 6 droving creatures, or 20 guard creatures at once. The trainer gains a +1 bonus to reaction rolls when approaching tame but uncontrolled animals of any type he can train.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Trainer Type | Wage |\n| Domestic animal (Dog, hawk, horse, etc.) | 25gp/month |\n| Wild animal (Bear, cat, etc.) | 75gp/month |\n| Dire, giant, or prehistoric animal (any) | 150gp/month |\n| Monstrosity or vermin (any) | 250gp/month |\n\nAnimal trainers cost between 25gp/month and 250gp/month to hire. Those able to train wild animals, giant animals, or monsters increasingly more expensive to hire. The Animal Trainer Wages table shows the average cost to hire different types of trainers. If a creature is of gigantic size or larger, its trainers cost a minimum of 150gp/month.\n\nIn order to train mounts for combat (e.g., warhorses), a trainer must also be a marshal of the appropriate type. The character earns either his wages as an animal trainer or wages as a marshal, whichever is higher. In general, light cavalry marshals earn 60gp/month while heavy cavalry marshals earn 120gp/month. See *Domains at War: Campaigns* for more information on marshals.\n\nFlying creatures trained as adults require monster whispering, e.g., one trainer per creature. (Certain other particularly willful monsters also require monster whispering.)\n\n### Tricks\n\nTricks are tasks or activities that a monster has been trained to perform on command. Possible tricks include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following:\n\n* **Attack:** The creature attacks apparent enemies. Its handler may point to a particular creature that he wishes the creature to attack, and it will comply if able.\n* **Carry:** The creature allows its handler to ride on its back.\n* **Come:** The creature comes to its handler, even if it normally would not do so.\n* **Defend:** The creature defends its handler (or is ready to defend its master if no threat is present), even without any command being given. Alternatively, its master can command the creature to defend a specific other character.\n* **Down:** The creature breaks off from combat or otherwise backs down. A creature that doesn’t know this trick continues to fight until it must flee (due to injury, a fear effect, or the like) or its opponent is defeated.\n* **Fetch:** The creature goes and gets something. If its handler does not point out a specific item, the creature fetches some random object.\n* **Guard:** The creature stays in place and prevents others from approaching.\n* **Heel:** The creature follows its handler closely, even to places where it normally wouldn’t go.\n* **Perform:** The creature performs a variety of simple tricks, such as sitting up, rolling over, roaring or barking, and so on.\n* **Seek:** The creature moves into an area and looks around for anything that is obviously alive or animate.\n* **Stay:** The creature stays in place, waiting for its handler to return. It does not challenge other creatures that come by, though it still defends itself if it needs to.\n* **Track:** The creature tracks the scent presented to it.\n* **Work:** The creature carries, pulls, or pushes more than its normal load.\n\nA tamed and trained monster will perform its tricks for its trainer and for any additional **handlers** the trainer introduces to it. Handlers do not need to be proficient in the appropriate Animal Training proficiency, but if they are not they can only safely control one monster at a time. (Monsters trained to particular roles may be more easily handled, as described below).\n\n### Roles\n\nRather than teaching a monster individual tricks, its trainer can train it for a particular **role**. Essentially, a monster’s role represents a preselected set of known tricks that fit into a common scheme, such as guarding, hunting, or working. Each role counts as one or more tricks. A monster can be trained for only one role, and only for roles for which it can learn the required number of tricks. If the creature is capable of learning additional tricks (above and beyond those included in its role), it may do so when training for its role is completed.\n\n**Drovers (D):** Drovers are trained to bring livestock together into a herd and move the herd from place to place. A proficient character (e.g., one with the appropriate Animal Training proficiency) can safely control up to six droving creatures, and an unproficient character can control only one. Drover training is exceptionally demanding, and counts as **seven tricks**.\n\n**Guards (G):** Guards are trained to attack designated targets and defend designated characters or locations. Guards will accompany their handlers when requested, but loyally stay in place when their handlers are not present. A proficient character can safely control up to 20 guard creatures. An unproficient character can safely control up to 6 guard creatures, if an animal trainer has taught him the appropriate commands. Guard training increases a creature’s morale score (ML) by 2, to a maximum of +2, but it is highly demanding, equivalent to learning **seven tricks** from an animal trainer. Many creatures lack the intelligence or temperament to be guards – these are usually trained as hunters instead. (Some races have an affinity with certain creatures, and can train them as guards more easily. See p. XX for more details.).\n\n**Hunters (H):** Hunters are trained to accompany their handlers on hunts, where they will track and kill designated targets. Unlike guard creatures, hunters require constant monitoring and discipline to ensure they stay under control. Therefore, a proficient character can safely control only six hunter creatures, and an unproficient character can control only one. Hunter training counts as learning only **two tricks**, so most animals of a carnivorous nature can be trained as hunters even if they are not suitable as guards.\n\n**Livestock (L):** Livestock is trained to be easily herded by a shepherd, sheepdog, or similar. A proficient character or drover animal can safely control any number of livestock, provided they are part of the same social group (pack, herd, etc.). An unproficient character can safely control only one livestock. Livestock will not accept riders, pull loads, or carry burdens, and in battle or other stressful situations will tend to react according to their natural instincts (fleeing if a prey animal, or attacking if a predator). Domesticated herd animals can serve as livestock without taming or training. Otherwise, livestock training counts as learning **one trick**.\n\n**Mounts (M):** Mounts are trained to carry a rider on their back and accept his directions. Mounts will not wear barding, and will not charge into melee unless facing natural predators. They will not attack with their natural weapons while carrying a rider. A proficient character (one with Adventuring, Animal Training, Beast Friendship, or Riding proficiency) can safely control a ridden mount outside of battle. If the character has Riding proficiency, he can control a ridden mount in battle; and outside of battle, he can control up to six mounts, one ridden and the others ponied on lead ropes. An unproficient character can safely control a mount on a lead rope, but cannot ride one without grave risk to himself (save versus Paralysis each round or fall off). Mount training counts as **five tricks**, so when dealing with less-intelligent beasts, suitable specimens might be rare and expensive. Note that even sapient creatures which are to carry riders must be trained as mounts, because the subtleties of communication between rider and mount, and of movement while laden with a rider, do not come naturally. A flying creature cannot be trained as a mount until it reaches adolescent age.\n\n**War Mounts (WM):** War mounts are trained to carry a rider into battle and accept his directions despite the chaos around it. War mounts will wear barding, and will charge into melee, even if not naturally willing to do so. In melee, war mounts will attack their masters’ targets using their natural weapons. War mounts are subject to the same limits on control as mounts (see above). As with guard training, war mount training increases a creature’s morale score by 2, to a maximum of +2, and war mounts without riders can function as guard creatures. Training as a war mount is even more demanding than guard or mount training, counting as **eight tricks**. Very few animals have the intelligence and temperament to serve as war mounts, so they tend to be very expensive. Sapient creatures which are to carry troops into battle must receive war mount training. Unlike creatures of animal intelligence, their morale score is not increased by war mount training, however. A flying creature cannot be trained as a war mount until it reaches adolescent age.\n\n**Work Beast (WB):** Work beasts are trained to pull heavy loads or carry burdens. Work beasts are not trained to accept a rider, and in battle or other stressful situations will tend to react according to their natural instincts (fleeing if a prey animal, or attacking if a predator). Teaching an animal to be a work beast counts as **two tricks**. A proficient character can safely control six work beasts, and an unproficient character can control only one.\n\n### Magic and Monster Training\n\nWhen available, magic can be a powerful aid to monster training.\n\n###### Animal Friendship\n\nWhenever elves build fastnesses, all ordinary animals within 5 miles of the stronghold become kind and helpful to the elves. Such animals are always considered tame for the purposes of training by the elves who reside in the fastness.\n\n###### Beast Friendship/Friend of Birds and Beasts\n\nAll animal henchman recruited with Beast Friendship are automatically considered tame towards the character for the purposes of training. Animal henchmen can be trained by the character, via monster whispering, for any role for which they possess sufficient intelligence (tricks); the character does not have to separately possess Animal Training to train his animal henchman. Because of his innate understanding of the language of beasts, a character with Beast Friendship always counts as proficient for purposes of handling trained animals in their roles.\n\n###### Bewitch\n\nThe various **bewitch** spells are a great boon to animal trainers. As soon as a creature is **bewitched** it is immediately considered tame for the purposes of training by the spellcaster. An appropriate Animal Training proficiency is still required to train a **bewitched** creature, but such training will occur at child rates, even if the creature is already an adolescent or older. However, if the **bewitchment’s** duration ever expires (whether from **dispel** or a successful saving throw), the creature will revert to being wild until it is **bewitched** again. As always, a creature’s behavior when the spell ends will depend on how it was treated while **bewitched**.\n\nEXAMPLE: Llewyn, an elven animal trainer with Animal Training (bears), has captured an adult grizzly bear. He decides to train it as a hunter (2 tricks). Grizzly bears have a base training time of 3 months. Therefore, it will take Llewyn (1 x 3 x 6) 18 months to tame the adult bear, and another (1 x 3 x 2) + (1 x 3 x 2 x ½) 9 months train it, 27 months total. Although ageless, Llewyn is quite impatient, so he casts *bewitch beast*on the bear instead. It is immediately tamed, and he can now train it as if it were a child. Now it will take only (1 x 3) + (1 x ½ x 3) 4.5 months to train it! The downside, however, is that Llewyn will lose control of his bear if the bewitch ever expires.\n\n###### Speak with Beasts\n\nA character under the effects of *speak with beasts*always counts as proficient for the purposes of handling trained animals in their roles. He may handle a friendly but untrained animal in any role it is capable of fulfilling as if it were trained for the role. The character does not count as proficient in this case (unless he actually does possess the appropriate proficiency). He automatically counts as monster whispering when training animals he can speak with.\n\nEXAMPLE: Llewyn has stumbled upon an enormous stash of ivory hidden in a jungle temple. After bagging the ivory, Llewyn discovers it weighs 100 stone, well more than he can carry. Llewyn casts *bewitch beast*on a nearby rhinoceros (rendering it friendly), then *speak with beasts*.While the spells last, Llewyn can handle the rhinoceros as if he were an unproficient handler of a trained workbeast. This allows him to benefit from its 100-stone carrying capacity.\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Training Race** | **Affinity** | **No Affinity** |\n| Bugbear | Cave Bears | Dogs (all), Equines (all) |\n| Centaur | Equines (all), Herd Animals (all) | Wolves (all) |\n| Dwarf | Bears (all) | Camels |\n| Elf | Cats (all), Dolphins, Raptors (all) | None |\n| Cyclops | Herd Animals (all) | Dogs (all), Equines (all) |\n| Ettin | Cave Bears | Dogs (all), Equines (all) |\n| Faerie, Brownie | None | Dogs (all), Equines (all) |\n| Faerie, Knocker | None | Dogs (all), Equines (all) |\n| Faerie, Nixie | Giant Fish (all), Equines (all) | Bears (all), Dogs (all) |\n| Faerie, Piskie | Dogs (all), Equines (all) | Cats (all), Herd Animals |\n| Faerie, Pixie | Giant Bats, Raptors (small, medium) | Dogs (all), Equines (all) |\n| Faerie, Redcap | Giant Bats, Raptors (small, medium) | Dogs (all), Equines (all) |\n| Faerie, Spriggan | Giant Bats, Raptors (small, medium) | Dogs (all), Equines (all) |\n| Faerie, Sprite | Giant Bats, Raptors (small, medium) | Dogs (all), Equines (all) |\n| Giant, Hill | Cave Bears, Dire Wolves | Dogs (all), Equines (all) |\n| Giant, Stone | Cave Bears, Cave Gorillas | Dogs (all), Equines (all) |\n| Giant, Frost | Dire Wolves, Polar Bears | Dogs (all), Equines (all) |\n| Giant, Fire | Hellhounds, Hydras | Dogs (all), Equines (all) |\n| Gnome | Giant Shrews | Wolves (all) |\n| Gnoll | Hyenas (all) | Dogs (all), Equines (all) |\n| Goblin | Dire Wolves, Giant Rats | Dogs (all), Equines (all) |\n| Halfling | None | Wolves (all) |\n| Hobgoblin | Cave Gorillas | Dogs (all) |\n| Kobold | Giant Weasels, Tokay Gulls | Dogs (all), Equines (all) |\n| Lizardman | Giant Lizards (all) | Dogs (all), Equines (all) |\n| Morlock | Cave Gorillas | Dogs (all), Equines (all) |\n| Neanderthal | Cave Gorillas | Wolves (all) |\n| Nymph, Dryad | Giant Bees | Dogs (all), Equines (all) |\n| Nymph, Naiad | Giant Fish (all) | Raptors (all) |\n| Nymph, Oread | Raptors (all), Wolves (all) | Dogs (all), Equines (all) |\n| Orc | Boars (all) | Dogs (all), Equines (all) |\n| Ogre | Cave Bears | Dogs (all), Equines (all) |\n| Titan, Greater | Giant Crabs, Giant Raptors, Griffons | None |\n| Titan, Lesser | Dire Wolves, Giant Raptors, Lions | None |\n| Triton | Devil Rays, Giant Crabs, Giant Fish (all) | Land animals (all) |\n| Troglodyte | Giant Chameleons | Dogs (all), Equines (all) |\n| Troll | None | Dogs (all), Equines (all) |\n\n### Encounters with Tamed Monsters\n\nNormally, a tamed and trained monster is introduced to a new handler by a character that already controls it. Sometimes this process breaks down – a trainer might be killed or quit before control is handed over, or a monster might be encountered “off the leash.”\n\nTo determine how a tame but uncontrolled monster responds, make a reaction roll. Apply a +2 bonus if the character approaching it has the appropriate Animal Training proficiency. (Remember that characters with Beast Friendship or under the effects of *speak with beasts*always count as proficient for the purposes of handling trained animals*.*) If the reaction roll is 9 or higher, the character immediately becomes the animal’s handler.\n\n### Monster Taming and Training by Other Races\n\nMankind is not the only race to tame and train beasts to serve it. Dwarves, elves, giants, and beastmen of various sorts all rely on trained monsters. Just as each race has its own distinct physical and mental characteristics, so too does each race have certain monsters with which it has affinity, or lacks affinity, for training.\n\nThe Monster Taming and Training by Race table lists the races and the creatures they have an affinity, or lack of an affinity, with. Feel free to add or subtract races and affinities to reflect your campaign setting.\n\nWhen a trainer has an affinity with a monster he is training, training it as a guard or war mount only counts as teaching it two tricks. This reflects the mutual bond that forms between the trainer and trainee.\n\nEXAMPLE: Kurk has just tamed a brown bear cub that he wants to train as a guard. He rolls 2d4 to see how many tricks the cub can learn, and scores a 5. A brown bear has a trainability modifier of +1, meaning the cub can only learn (5+1) 6 tricks. Guard training counts as seven tricks, so most trainers would not be able to train the cub. However, Kurk is a dwarf, so he has an affinity with brown bears. That means training the cub to be a guard will only count as teaching it two tricks. Kurk’s affinity for brown bears will also speed up the training time. Grizzly bears have a training period of 3 months, so, normally, training a tamed cub to be a guard would take [(3 months x 1 trick) + (3 months x 6/2 tricks)] 12 months. But Kurk will be able to train the cub to be a guard in [(3 months x 1 trick) + (3 months x ½ tricks)] 4.5 months.\n\nWhen a trainer has no affinity with a monster he is training, its base training period is doubled for all purposes. The morale of a trained monster is reduced by 2 points while handled by a creature with no affinity with it. Mounts will not accept riders who have no affinity for them (treat the rider as unproficient if he attempts to ride anyway). War mounts will accept riders who have no affinity for them, but function only as (non-war) mounts when doing so.\n\nEXAMPLE: Mulik, an orc chieftain, captures a baby mastiff (war dog) during a caravan raid. Mulik decides he would like to tame and train the puppy to be a guard dog. Normally it would take [(1 month) + (1 month x 1 trick) + (1 month x 6/2 tricks)] 5 months to tame and train the puppy, but it will take Mulik 10 months because orcs have no affinity with dogs. A war dog, when trained as a guard, normally has a morale score of +2, but Mulik’s war dog only has a morale score of 0. The puppy grows up into a mangy cur that has little love for its brutish master.\n\n### Monster Taming and Training Characteristics\n\n###### Diminutive\n\nThe name given to the creature’s young, e.g., pup for dire wolf or maggot for giant fly.\n\n###### Weight\n\nThe average weight of the creature when full grown, in lbs. Adolescents weigh 75% of adult weight. Children weigh 25% to 75% of adult weight (50% on average). Babies weigh 5% to 25% of adult weight (15% on average). A clutch of eggs weigh 2.5% of adult weight in total (i.e. creatures that lay more eggs lay smaller eggs).\n\n###### Size Category\n\nThe relative size of the creature – man-size (M), large (L), huge (H), gigantic (G), or colossal (C). A creature’s size category is determined by its length or height and its weight, as shown on the table below. If a creature’s height and weight place it in two different categories, weight is generally determinative. Flying creatures with particularly large wing spans on light frames are sometimes placed in one size category larger than their weight would indicate.\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Man-Sized** | **Large** | **Huge** | **Gigantic** | **Colossal** |\n| **Length/Height** | Less than 8’ long/tall | 8’ to 12’ long/tall | 12’ to 20’ long/tall | 20’ to 32’ long/tall | 32’ or more long/tall |\n| **Weight** | Up to 400 lbs | 401 to 2,000 lbs | 2,001 to 8,000 lbs | 8,001 to 32,000 lbs | More than 32,000 lbs |\n\n###### Normal Load\n\nSome creatures are valued primarily for their ability to carry equipment, supplies, or treasure. The figure listed is the **normal load** the creature can carry in stone. Most creatures can carry a maximum of twice their normal load. When carrying more than their normal load, their speed is reduced to half.\n\nEXAMPLE: A giant tiger beetle can carry its normal load of 250 stone at its full speed of 150’ per turn. It can carry up to 500 stone at 75’ per turn.\n\nHumanoids can endure heavier loads relative to their own size. Humanoids may carry their normal load at full movement. They may carry up to half again of their normal load at three-quarters movement. They may carry up to twice their normal load at half movement. They may carry up to four times their normal load at one-quarter movement.\n\nEXAMPLE: A cyclops can carry 90 stone at its full speed of 90’ per turn. It can carry up to 135 stone at 67’ per turn. It can carry up to 180 stone at 45’ per turn. It can carry up to 360 stone at 22’ per turn.\n\n###### Lifespan\n\nLifespan indicates the ages at which a creature enters each age category, in the order Baby/Juvenile/Adolescent/Adult/Middle Aged/Old/Ancient/Maximum. All creatures enter the baby category at age 0, but the baby categories of oviparous creatures are designated with an E instead of 0 to indicate that the creature begins its life as an egg. Creatures with short lifespans tend to be more valuable as babies and juveniles, while creatures with long lifespans tend to be more valuable as adults.\n\nEXAMPLE: A griffin’s lifespan is designated E/0.25/0.5/3.3/22/33/44/55. A griffin begins as an egg when born; at 3 months (0.25 years) old it hatches into a child; at 6 months (0.5 years) it becomes an adolescent; at 3.3 years it becomes an adult; at 22 years it becomes middle aged; at 33 years it becomes old; at 44 years it becomes ancient; and at 55 years it reaches its maximum lifespan.\n\n###### Role\n\nRole indicates the type of training the creature would typically receive, including Drover (D), Guard (G), Hunter (H), livestock (L), mount (M), war mount (WM), or work beast (WB). Training is not applicable (N/A) to sapient creatures, unless they are typically used as mounts.\n\n###### Trained Value\n\nThis column shows the typical market price in gold pieces at which a trained and tamed adolescent or adult creature could be bought or sold. Note that trained value varies by training. Guards and war mounts, being rare specimens, often command a premium.\n\nIn most cases, trained creatures sell for much more than untrained creatures. However, some creatures’ trained value will simply be equal to their untrained adult value. This occurs when the creature is very difficult to manage, such that the cost of the creature handlers required to field the creatures simply does not justify training or using them. Such creature are essentially valuable only for their monster parts (p. XX – XX).\n\nAnimals, constructs, oozes, vermin, and other creatures of less than sapient intelligence can be bought and sold as property in most realms. Creatures of sapient intelligence are generally only be bought and sold as property (slaves) in chaotic realms where slavery is permitted. Some Lawful realms permit criminals or prisoners of war to be sold into indentured servitude until they pay off their debt to society.\n\nTrained value also determines the wage that a creature can command as a mercenary, or that a controller can charge for controlling the creature on behalf of an employer. The wage equals the trained value/33. If the creature’s weekly supply cost is more than 0.5gp per month, reduce its wage by 4 x excess supply cost.\n\nEXAMPLE: A demonic attercop is a sapient monstrosity with a trained value of 93,500gp and a weekly supply cost of 48gp per month. A dark lord that wishes to hire a demonic attercop to undertake his evil schemes would have to pay (93,500 / 33) – (48 x 4) = 2,641gp per month.\n\n**Limits of Availability:** For all transactions, apply the limits of the Equipment Availability by Market Class table. You can impose further limits depending on your setting. Just because a price is listed doesn’t mean the monster is available in every market everywhere.\n\n**Attributes:** Monsters with high attributes are worth more. Each attribute of 13-15 adds 25% to the monster’s cost. Each attribute of 16-17 adds 100% to the monster’s cost. Each attribute of 18 adds 400% to the monster’s cost.\n\nEXAMPLE: Bucephalus is a medium warhorse fit for a world conqueror, with STR 18, INT 18, WIS 18, DEX 18, CON 18, and CHA 18. A typical medium warhorse costs 250gp. Bucephalus costs 250gp + (400% x 250gp) + (400% x 250gp) + (400% x 250gp) + (400% x 250gp) + (400% x 250gp) + (400% x 250gp) = 6,250gp. The historical Bucephalus cost 13 silver talents, which equates to 7,800gp, so ACKS is giving Alexander the Great a discount.\n\nMonsters with low attributes are worth less. Reduce the monster’s price by 15% for each ability score of 3, 10% for each ability score of 4-5, and 5% for each ability score of 6-8.\n\nEXAMPLE: Encephalitus is a medium warhorse fit for not much at all, with STR 3, INT 3, WIS 3, DEX 3, CON 3, and CHA 3. A typical medium warhorse costs 250gp. Encephalitus costs 250gp – [6 x (15% x 250gp)], or 25gp.\n\n###### Adult/Juvenile/Baby Value\n\nThis column shows the typical market price in gold pieces at which an untamed, untrained creature of that age could be bought or sold. Adolescent creatures are priced as adults. Eggs are priced as babies.\n\nUntrained adults are usually worth much less than trained adults. Untrained sapient adults are essentially worthless except as slave labor or monster parts. Untrained adults of less-than-sapient intelligence can sometimes be valuable if they are readily trained and quite powerful.\n\nJuveniles and babies usually are worth more than untrained adults, but less than trained adults. Creatures that mature quickly are generally most valuable as juveniles or babies. At that age, they can be readily trained and then quickly put into service, owing to their short age-to-maturity. Creatures that mature slowly and/or are expensive to maintain are often captured as adults. The additional time and cost of training an adult (or of magically bewitching it) can be worthwhile if it will take a juvenile creature years to mature, during which it must be fed and cared for. Elephants, which take years to mature, were captured and trained as adults for this reason in our real world.\n\nAdult, juvenile, and baby value can be adjusted by high and low ability scores, as above. Availability is limited by market and setting, as with trained monsters.\n\nNote that dragons of each age category are purchased as adult creatures. There is no such thing as a “baby venerable dragon”; it’s a dragon spawn.\n\n###### Supply Cost\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Size | Herbivore/Omnivore | Carnivore |\n| Small or Man-Sized | 0.5 | 2 |\n| Large | 4 | 16 |\n| Huge | 12 | 48 |\n| Gigantic | 48 | 192 |\n| Colossal | 240 | 960 |\n\nThe cost per week in gold pieces to supply an adult creature with adequate provisions. Carnivorous creatures cost more to supply than herbivorous ones, and big creatures cost more to supply than small ones, as shown on the adjoining table. Where creatures have been assigned a size category larger than their weight would otherwise indicate (due to, e.g. long frame, wings, etc.) supply cost is halved.\n\nEXAMPLE: With its 200’ wingspan, a giant roc is a colossal carnivore. However, based on its weight (15,000 lbs), it is merely gigantic. Therefore it is assigned a supply cost of 480gp, one-half that of a colossal carnivore by weight.\n\nEggs, herbivorous creatures grazing on a pasture, and carnivorous creatures hunting on a range need not be supplied. Baby, juvenile, and adolescent creatures require less food; multiply the supply cost by the creature’s age as a percentage of its age upon entering adulthood. Round to the nearest 0.5gp. (This usually matters only if the adventurers have set up a program of monster breeding.)\n\nEXAMPLE: An adult griffin has a supply cost of 16gp per week. A griffin enters adulthood at 3.3 years old. Therefore a 1-year-old griffin has a supply cost of (1/3.3) x (16) = 4.84gp per week, rounded to 5gp per week.\n\nAny time small or man-sized creatures are mounted on creatures of large size or more, just use mount’s supply cost rather than the total. This allows a unit of 60 ogres and a unit of 60 cavalry to maintain the same supply cost (4gp each) without fractional gp values.\n\n###### Training Period\n\nThe number of months it takes to tame the creature, or teach the creature its first trick. Training period is determined by a creature’s sapience and temperament. If the value listed is “-“, then the creature cannot be trained.\n\n###### Trainability Modifier (TM)\n\nA modifier applied to the number of tricks the creature can learn, representing differences due to the species’ sapience and temperament. If the modifier listed is “S”, then the creature is sapient. Sapient creatures do not need to be trained unless they want to serve as mounts or war mounts, and are not limited to a number of tricks. If the value listed is “+3”, then the creature is semi-sapient. If the value listed is “-“, then the creature is mindless or otherwise cannot be trained.\n\n### Monster Taming and Training Tables\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Animals** | **Diminutive** | **Weight (lbs)** | **Size** | **Normal**  **Load (st)** | **Lifespan** | **Role** | **Trained**  **Value** | **Adult**  **Value** | **Juvenile**  **Value** | **Baby**  **Value** | **Supply**  **Cost** | **Training**  **Period** | **TM** | **BR** |\n| Baboon, Rock | Infant | 230 | M | 14 | 0/4/7.5/12/18/27/36/45 | G | 280 | 110 | 50 | 15 | 0.5 | 1 | +3 | 0.017 |\n| Bat, Giant | Pup | 75 | M | 4 | 0/0.5/2/4/9.66/14.5/19.25/24 | G | 110 | 20 | 2.5 | 2 | 2 | 5 | +1 | 0.035 |\n| Bear, Black | Cub | 550 | L | 18 | 0/2/4/8/14/21/28/35 | H | 345 | 45 | 100 | 50 | 2 | 2 | +1 | 0.032 |\n| Bear, Brown | Cub | 800 | L | 25 | 0/2/4/8/14/21/28/35 | H | 890 | 335 | 370 | 170 | 4 | 2 | +1 | 0.055 |\n| Bear, Brown, Riding | Cub | 800 | L | 25 | 0/2/4/8/14/21/28/35 | WM | 1,450 | 335 | 370 | 170 | 4 | 2 | +1 | 0.062 |\n| Bear, Cave | Cub | 1,100 | L | 36 | 0/2/4/8/14/21/28/35 | H | 1,850 | 850 | 830 | 40 | 4 | 3 | +1 | 0.096 |\n| Bear, Cave, Riding | Cub | 1,100 | L | 36 | 0/2/4/8/14/21/28/35 | WM | 2,550 | 850 | 8300 | 440 | 4 | 3 | +1 | 0.108 |\n| Bear, Polar | Cub | 1,400 | L | 45 | 0/2/4/8/14/21/28/35 | H | 4,100 | 3,000 | 2,000 | 1,000 | 4 | 3 | +1 | 0.190 |\n| Bear, Polar, Riding | Cub | 1,400 | L | 45 | 0/2/4/8/14/21/28/35 | WM | 5,000 | 3,000 | 2,000 | 1,000 | 4 | 3 | +1 | 0.212 |\n| Boar, Common | Piglet | 375 | M | 12 | 0/0.75/2/4/6/9/12/15 | H | 240 | 4 | 1 | 0.75 | 0.5 | 6 | -2 | 0.028 |\n| Boar, Giant | Piglet | 930 | L | 30 | 0/1/5/9/15/22/30/37 | H | 850 | 200 | 3 | 2 | 16 | 2 | +2 | 0.070 |\n| Boar, Giant, Riding | Piglet | 930 | L | 30 | 0/1/5/9/15/22/30/37 | WM | 1,675 | 200 | 3 | 2 | 16 | 2 | +2 | 0.070 |\n| Camel | Calf | 1,000 | L | 30 | 0/2/5/8/20/30/40/50 | M | 100 | 10 | 2 | 1 | 4 | 5 | +1 | 0.011 |\n| Cat, Catamount | Cub | 210 | M | 12 | 0/1/2.5/5/10/15/20/25 | H | 850 | 25 | 480 | 325 | 2 | 2.5 | +1 | 0.040 |\n| Cat, Cheetah | Cub | 100 | M | 6 | 0/1/2.5/5/10/15/20/25 | H | 475 | 50 | 250 | 170 | 2 | 2.5 | +1 | 0.037 |\n| Cat, Lion | Cub | 375 | L | 25 | 0/2/4/6/12/16/21/30 | H | 2,600 | 1,000 | 1,200 | 640 | 8 | 4.5 | +1 | 0.127 |\n| Cat, Leopard | Cub | 300 | M | 18 | 0/1.25/2.5/5/10/15/20/25 | H | 1,185 | 35 | 640 | 430 | 2 | 4 | +1 | 0.087 |\n| Cat, Lynx | Kitten | 60 | S | 3 | 0/0.75/1.5/3/12/15/18/21 | H | 175 | **16.5** | 110 | 85 | 2 | 2.5 | +1 | 0.013 |\n| Cat, Saber-Tooth | Cub | 800 | L | 48 | 0/2.5/5/7.5/14/21/28/35 | H | 6,000 | 3,000 | 2,365 | 1,000 | 16 | 6 | +1 | 0.268 |\n| Cat, Saber-Tooth, Riding | Cub | 800 | L | 48 | 0/2.5/5/7.5/14/21/28/35 | WM | 6,365 | 3,000 | 2,365 | 1,000 | 16 | 6 | +1 | 0.268 |\n| Cat, Tiger | Cub | 500 | L | 30 | 0/2/4/6/12/16/21/30 | H | 3,325 | 1,465 | 1,550 | 800 | 16 | 5.5 | +1 | 0.157 |\n| Crocodile, Common | Hatchling | 375 | L | 8 | E/0.25/3/8/22/33/44/55 | H | 5 | 4 | 1 | 0.75 | 16 | 8 | -2 | 0.006 |\n| Crocodile, Giant | Hatchling | 17,600 | G | 400 | E/0.5/5/20/100/150/200/250 | H | 10,250 | 2,600 | 50 | 45 | 192 | 12 | -2 | 0.468 |\n| Crocodile, Large | Hatchling | 2,200 | H | 65 | E/0.25/4/10/28/42/56/70 | H | 800 | 150 | 8.5 | 7.5 | 48 | 11 | -2 | 0.051 |\n| Devil Ray, Giant | Pup | 3,500 | H | 70 | 0/J/5/10/15/25/35/45 | M | 1,785 | 800 | 200 | 150 | 12 | **3** | 0 | 0.110 |\n| Dog, Hunting | Pup | 60 | M | 2 | 0/0.16/0.5/1.5/6/9/12/15 | H | 10 | 5.5 | 6 | 5.5 | 0.5 | 1 | +1 | 0.006 |\n| Dog, War | Pup | 180 | M | 6 | 0/0.16/0.5/1.5/5.5/7.5/10/12.5 | G | 75 | 17.5 | 3 | 2.25 | 0.5 | 1 | +2 | 0.019 |\n| Dolphin | Calf | 350 | M | 7 | 0/2.5/5/12/24/36/47/60 | H | 375 | 35 | 80 | 35 | 2 | 1 | +3 | 0.029 |\n| Elephant | Calf | 9,000 | G | 180 | 0/5/12/18/34/51/68/85 | WB | 1,150 | 1,150 | 630 | 315 | 48 | 1 | +3 | 0.229 |\n| Elephant, War | Calf | 9,000 | G | 180 | 0/5/12/18/34/51/68/85 | WM | 2,000 | 1,150 | 630 | 315 | 48 | 3 | +3 | 0.605 |\n| Equine, Donkey | Foal | 500 | L | 15 | 0/0.5/2/6/20/30/40/50 | WB | 10 | 5 | 1.75 | 1.25 | 0 | 1 | +2 | 0.002 |\n| Equine, Heavy Horse | Foal | 2,000 | L | 40 | 0/0.5/2/5/12/18/24/30 | WB | 40 | 20 | 10 | 8 | 4 | 2 | 0 | 0.029 |\n| Equine, Heavy War Horse | Foal | 2,000 | L | 40 | 0/0.5/2/5/12/18/24/30 | WM | 315 | 20 | 10 | 8 | 4 | 2 | 0 | 0.046 |\n| Equine, Light Horse | Foal | 1,000 | L | 20 | 0/0.5/2/5/12/18/24/30 | M | 75 | 10 | 20 | 15 | 4 | 2 | +1 | 0.008 |\n| Equine, Light War Horse | Foal | 1,000 | L | 20 | 0/0.5/2/5/12/18/24/30 | WM | 150 | 10 | 20 | 15 | 4 | 2 | +1 | 0.018 |\n| Equine, Medium Horse | Foal | 1,500 | L | 30 | 0/0.5/2/5/12/18/24/30 | M | 40 | 15 | 12 | 10 | 4 | 2 | +1 | 0.019 |\n| Equine, Med.
