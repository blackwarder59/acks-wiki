The Judge may use whichever method he prefers for any given monster. |\n\nIf you are using ability scores for the monster (p. XX), then the aging effects for AC, speed, HD, and damage can be calculated by applying the appropriate penalty (-6, -4, or -2) for the age category (Baby/Ancient, Child/Old, and Adolescent/Middle-Aged) respectively.\n\nAdjustments for size and maximum load should still be applied using the Monster Age Adjustment table.\n\nEXAMPLE: An adult lion with 9 STR, DEX, and CON has AC 3, HD 5, MV 150’, and maximum load 50. It has an attack throw of 6+ and deals 1d4+1 points of damage with its claws and 1d10 with its bite. Years later, it has become ancient, leaving it with 3 STR, DEX, and CON. This reduces its AC to 0 and its MV by 35’ to 115’ [150’ – (30’ x 150’/120’)], and maximum load to 50 – [3 x 25/10] 42. As a 5 HD creature with a -3 STR penalty, it has an attack throw of 9+. It deals 1d4-3 points of damage with its claws and 1d10-3 damage with its bite. Its HD are reduced by 3 points per die, from 22 down to 7.\n"
