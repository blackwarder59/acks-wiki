  "html": "<h2>Monster Parts (Mundane)</h2>\n<p>Several entries on Merchandise tables and Special Treasure tables describe the gp value of meats, hides, furs, and other monster parts. The rules in this section explain how monsters slain in the course of play can be harvested for parts to sell or use. The subsequent section details using monster parts as special components in magic research (see <em><strong>ACKS II RR</strong></em>, p. XX).</p>\n<p>Adventurers can identify the value of a monster’s parts with a Naturalism proficiency throw or a Loremastery throw. Adventurers will require certain proficiencies to be able to efficiently harvest a monster’s parts for sale or use; these are noted in each section.</p>\n<p>Once harvested, monster parts may be sold at their market value, subject to the limitations of Equipment Availability in Markets (<em><strong>ACKS II RR</strong></em><em>,</em> p. 39). Alternatively, monster parts may be sold as trade goods following the rules for Mercantile Ventures (<em><strong>ACKS II RR</strong></em><em>,</em> p. 142). Adventurers may gain XP from mercantile ventures selling monster parts. Treat the base market value of the monster parts as their cost of the goods sold for the purposes of calculating their mercantile income.</p>\n<h4>Antlers, Horns, and Tusks</h4>\n<p>Some monsters have antlers, horns, or tusks with decorative, instrumental, or medicinal value (hereafter just called horns, for simplicity). Common animal horns are worth 10gp per stone of weight, while exotic horns are worth 40gp – 100gp per stone of encumbrance.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Antlers, Horns, and Tusks</strong></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Monster</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Number</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Encumbrance (st)</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Value (gp)</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Avg.

Since the size and stature of a creature’s horns can vary widely based on its age, health, and physical condition, the table provides a set of random ranges as well as average values. Only male mammals should have antlers.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: The Judge is building a lair with an old dragon. The Judge decides to roll randomly for the value of the dragon’s horns. The roll of 1d10x50 yields a result of 450gp for the left horn and 500gp for the right horn, 950gp total. Since an old dragon typically has horns worth around 560gp, this is clearly a large, healthy specimen with a proud crown.</p>\n<p>Horns can be sold or used as raw materials by a weaponsmith. Horns can also be used as precious materials when enchanting magical weapons.</p>\n<p>Horns must be captured intact or they will be worthless. Horns will be intact provided the monster was not damaged with an area-of-effect attack. A character equipped with an axe or other cutting tool can remove a dead or helpless monster’s horns in one round per stone of encumbrance. Before a horn can be sold, it must be properly cleansed, trimmed, and polished. Properly preparing a horn requires Animal Husbandry or Trapping proficiency, and requires 1 turn (10 rounds) per stone encumbrance.</p>\n<p>Monsters in the baby, juvenile, and adolescent age categories never have antlers, horns, or tusks.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: The Zaharan ruinguard Moruvai has slain a unicorn with a 1,500gp horn (1 3/6 stone). It takes him (6 x 9/6) 9 rounds of hacking with his axe to cleave off the precious horn. He departs the site of his atrocity before any do-gooders can punish him. Cleaning, trimming, and polishing the horn will take (60 x 9/6) 90 more rounds (15 minutes), but this he can do later in the comfort of his evil lair.</p>\n<h4>Claws, Fangs, Stingers, Tails, and Talons</h4>\n<p>While most claws, fangs, stingers, tails, and talons are of little interest, a few monsters have particularly fierce natural weapons. These are often prized as museum pieces, trophies, or fetishes.</p>\n<p>A prized natural weapon is worth a number of gp equal to the maximum damage it can deal. For exceptional monsters with STR of 13 or more, include the damage bonus from high STR into the weapons’ damage when calculating its value. Natural weapons have an encumbrance of 1/6 stone per 10gp.</p>\n<h6>Claws/Talons</h6>\n<p>Claws/talons are prized if the monster’s claw/talon attack can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>break bone, eviscerate, or maim targets; or</li>\n<li>grab and carry man-sized or larger targets</li>\n</ul>\n<h6>Fangs</h6>\n<p>Fangs are prized if the monster’s bite attack can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>break bones, eviscerate, or maim targets</li>\n<li>inject acid or poison; or</li>\n<li>swallow man-sized or larger targets</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For game purposes “fangs” collectively encompasses all of the creature’s mouthparts, such as beaks, cuspids, incisors, mandibles, maxillae, molars, etc. Note that particularly impressive teeth are handled as tusks under Antlers, Horns, and Tusks, above.</p>\n<h6>Stinger</h6>\n<p>Stingers are prized if the monster’s sting attack can inject acid or poison into a target.</p>\n<h4>Feathers and Plumage</h4>\n<p>Some monsters and animals may have large, colorful feathers that command a high value – typically 1gp to 6gp in value each, with an encumbrance of 1 stone per 25 feathers. Feathers of some particularly impressive monsters can be even larger and more valuable. The feathers of a giant roc can be up to 20’ long and worth 120gp each!</p>\n<p>Feathers can be sold or used as raw materials by a fletcher. Feathers can also be used to pay the material cost of magical arrows or cloaks.</p>\n<p>As with fur pelts, feathers must be captured intact to maintain their value. Feathers will be intact provided the monster was not damaged with an area-of-effect attack. Damaged feathers are worthless. Plucking feathers takes 1 turn per stone of feathers.</p>\n<p>The Feathers and Plumage table catalogs which monsters have valuable feathers. Although feathered creatures have anywhere from 1,000 to 25,000 feathers, only a small percentage have notable market value: the 10 primary and 14 secondary flight feathers of each wing, and the 12 flight feathers of the tail (60 total). Crossbreeds have fewer feathers, depending on their body form. Some feathers may be damaged by age, weather, illness, or battle, so the table provides a set of random ranges as well as typical value for a monster’s plumage.</p>\n<p>Baby, juvenile, and adolescent monsters have feathers worth 25%, 50%, and 75% of the value of an adult monster.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Feathers and Plumage</strong></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Monster</strong></td>\n<td><strong>No. of Feathers</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Feather Length</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Feathers per Stone</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Value (per feather)</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Typical Plumage</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Faravahar*</td>\n<td>6d10</td>\n<td>40” – 75”</td>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>2d6 gp</td>\n<td>33 feathers, 230gp and 2 4/6 st</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Griffon*</td>\n<td>4d12*</td>\n<td>42” – 82”</td>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>2d6 gp</td>\n<td>24 feathers, 170gp and 2 st</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Gorgon*</td>\n<td>4d12*</td>\n<td>42” – 82”</td>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>2d6 gp</td>\n<td>24 feathers, 170gp and 2 st</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Harpy*</td>\n<td>4d12</td>\n<td>40” – 54”</td>\n<td>25</td>\n<td>1d6 gp</td>\n<td>25 feathers, 90gp and 1 st</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Hippogriff*</td>\n<td>4d12*</td>\n<td>54” – 102”</td>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>3d6 gp</td>\n<td>24 feathers, 250gp and 3 st</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Lammasu*</td>\n<td>4d12</td>\n<td>42” – 82”</td>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>2d6 gp</td>\n<td>24 feathers, 170gp and 2 st</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Ostrich</td>\n<td>6d10</td>\n<td>11” – 22”</td>\n<td>150</td>\n<td>1d3 sp</td>\n<td>33 feathers, 66sp, 1/6 st</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Ostrich, Giant</td>\n<td>6d10</td>\n<td>29” – 55”</td>\n<td>25</td>\n<td>1d6gp</td>\n<td>33 feathers, 115gp and 1 2/6 st</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Owlbeast</td>\n<td>3d10</td>\n<td>29” – 55”</td>\n<td>25</td>\n<td>1d6 gp</td>\n<td>16 feathers, 60gp and 4/6 st</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Pegasus*</td>\n<td>4d12*</td>\n<td>62” – 116”</td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>4d6 gp</td>\n<td>24 feathers, 335gp and 4 st</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Raptor, Giant</td>\n<td>6d10</td>\n<td>29” – 55”</td>\n<td>25</td>\n<td>1d6 gp</td>\n<td>33 feathers, 115gp and 1 2/6 st</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Raptor, Large</td>\n<td>6d10</td>\n<td>11” – 22”</td>\n<td>150</td>\n<td>1d3 sp</td>\n<td>33 feathers, 66sp, 1/6 st</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Raptor, Med.</td>\n<td>6d10</td>\n<td>7” – 15”</td>\n<td>225</td>\n<td>1d2 sp</td>\n<td>33 feathers, 5gp and 1/6 st</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Roc, Giant</td>\n<td>6d10</td>\n<td>11’ – 20’</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>6d20 gp</td>\n<td>33 feathers, 2,100gp and 33st</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Roc, Large</td>\n<td>6d10*</td>\n<td>6’ – 12’</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>7d6 gp</td>\n<td>33 feathers, 800gp and 8 2/6st</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Roc, Small</td>\n<td>6d10</td>\n<td>51” – 94”</td>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>3d6 gp</td>\n<td>33 feathers, 350gp and 4st</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Sphinx*</td>\n<td>4d12*</td>\n<td>70” – 128”</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4d8 gp</td>\n<td>25 feathers, 450gp and 5 st</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Strix</td>\n<td>6d10</td>\n<td>7” – 15”</td>\n<td>225</td>\n<td>1d2 sp</td>\n<td>33 feathers, 5gp and 1/6 st</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Stymph*</td>\n<td>6d10</td>\n<td>7” – 15”</td>\n<td>225</td>\n<td>1d2 sp</td>\n<td>33 feathers, 5gp and 1/6 st</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>*Feathers may also be valuable as special components, see p.

The time required for this labor, and the weight and value of the resulting product, is based on the monster’s weight, as shown on the Skinning, Fleshing, and Butchering table, below. Adventurers must have one of the following proficiencies in order to properly prepare animal products: Animal Husbandry, Labor (butchery), Labor (farming), or Trapping. If not, the time required for each process is doubled, and the amount yielded is halved. If desired, adventurers may collaborate in butchering monsters, dividing its weight amongst themselves. All participating characters must have the appropriate craftsman’s tools (even if they are unproficient).</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Process</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Time Required (turns)</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Product</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Amount Yielded (st)</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Value (gp)</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Skinning and Fleshing</td>\n<td>Monster Weight in lbs. / 10</td>\n<td>Pelt</td>\n<td>0.00265 x Monster Weight in lbs.</td>\n<td>1 x Pelt Encumbrance</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Butchering</td>\n<td>Monster Weight in lbs. / 5</td>\n<td>Meat</td>\n<td>0.0265 x Monster Weight in lbs.</td>\n<td>0.3 x Meat Encumbrance</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>EXAMPLE: Sorcha, a ranger with Trapping proficiency, kills a 600-pound dire wolf. It will take her (600/10) 60 turns to skin the animal, or about 10 hours. The dire wolf’s pelt will weigh (0.00265 x 600) 1.59 stone and be worth (1 x 1.59) 1.59gp. She can then butcher the dire wolf’s carcass, which will take her (600/5) 120 turns, about 20 hours. Butchering the dire wolf yields (0.0265 x 600) 15.9 stone of wolf meat, worth (0.3 x 15.9) 4.8gp. Her total profit on 30 hours of labor is 6.39gp. If Sorcha did not have Trapping proficiency, these tasks would take twice as long and yield half the value.</p>\n<p>Adventurers can hire laborers at a rate of 1sp per 8 hours to skin, flesh, and butcher their kills for them. The labor cost will work out to 0.000625gp x Monster Weight, and the net profit for the adventurers will work out to 0.01gp x Monster Weight.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: Sorcha hires a laborer to skin, flesh, and butcher the slain dire wolf. Since the wolf weighs 600 lbs, the laborer charges (600 x .000625) 0.38gp. That is, her laborer charges 1sp every 8 hours; 30 hours of his labor costs (1sp/8 hours x 30 hours) 3.8sp or 0.38gp. Sorcha’s net profit is (6.39gp – 0.38gp) or 6.01gp.

Particularly rare fur pelts are worth as much as 100gp per stone of encumbrance.</p>\n<p>The Foe Fur table catalogs which monsters have notably valuable pelts, along with their respective values and encumbrance.</p>\n<p>Adventurers who want a fur pelt must take great care when killing the monster. A monster’s carcass will yield an intact fur pelt only if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The monster was slain with just one attack; or</li>\n<li>The monster was slain entirely with blunt weapons; or</li>\n<li>The monster was slain by cold, death magic, electricity, or poison, and lost less than half its hit points to other attacks.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Damaged fur pelts are worth just 1gp per stone. Like normal pelts, fur pelts must be skinned and fleshed before they can be sold. Fur pelts can be used to make valuable rugs, capes, coats, and trophies.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: If Sorcha had slain the dire wolf entirely with blunt weapons, its pelt would have been worth 50gp instead of 1.59gp.</p>\n<h6>Armored Hides</h6>\n<p>Some monster pelts are so thick, durable, or hard that they can be used to forge armor. These <strong>armored hides</strong> can be sold or used as raw materials by an armorer. (Raw materials reduce the labor cost of a construction project by their value, to a maximum 25% of the total cost of the construction project; see <em>D@W: Campaigns,</em> p. 51). Armored hides can be used to pay material costs when enchanting magical armor and shields.</p>\n<p>The Monster Armored Hide table catalogs which monsters have armored hides, along with their respective values and encumbrance. Like all pelts, armored hides must be skinned and fleshed (see p. XX).</p>\n<p>As with fur pelts, armored hides must be captured intact to maintain their value. A monster’s armored hide will only be intact if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The monster was slain with just one attack; or</li>\n<li>The monster was slain by cold, death magic, electricity, or poison and lost half its hit points or less to other attacks.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Damaged armored pelts are worth just 1gp per stone.

Unless otherwise noted, baby, juvenile, and adolescent monsters have pelts and meat worth 25%, 50%, and 75% of the value of an adult monster.</p>\n<h6>Extraordinary Pelts</h6>\n<p>Monsters with high STR, CON, or CHA will have more valuable pelts than normal creatures of their type. If STR, CON, or CHA are 13-15, add 25% to the value of the monster’s pelt. If STR, CON, or CHA are 16-17, add 100% to the value. If STR, CON, or CHA are 18, add 400% to the value. The bonus from ability scores stacks.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: The adventurers have slain a particularly large and impressive mammoth (STR 16, CHA 14). A normal mammoth’s hide is worth 350gp. This mammoth’s hide is worth 350gp + (25% x 350gp) + (100% x 350gp), or 787gp.</p>\n<p>Monsters with low STR, CON, or CHA will have less valuable pelts. If STR, CON, or CHA are 3, reduce the value of the monster’s pelt by 75%. If STR, CON, or CHA are 4-5, reduce the value by 50%. If STR, CON, or CHA are 6-8, reduce the value by 25%. The penalty from ability scores stacks. If the penalty reduces the value to 0 or less, the pelt is simply worthless.</p>\n<h4>Venoms</h4>\n<p>Characters with Naturalism proficiency can identify venomous monsters and distinguish their different poisons with a successful proficiency throw of 11+. Extracting venom from a slain monster requires 1 hour of ancillary activity and a successful Animal Husbandry proficiency throw of 18+. The character gains a +4 bonus to the throw per additional rank of Animal Husbandry. If the throw fails, the character can try again. If the character’s proficiency throw to extract venom is an unmodified 1, he has accidentally gotten scratched by a fang or stinger. The character must immediately save versus Poison, as if hit by the monster.</p>\n<p>Once extracted, monster venoms can be applied to weapons. Each monster yields one dose of its venom. A dose is enough venom to treat twenty missiles (arrows, bolts, or darts) or one melee weapon. Note that venoms applied to missiles and melee weapons are not as effective as they are when coming from the monster itself. Venomous monsters penetrate their prey’s skin with hollow fangs or tubular stingers, then use muscles attached to their venom reservoirs to forcibly squirt venom deep within the target’s body tissue. In comparison, a sword or arrow is simply a less effective mechanism for delivering poison.</p>\n<p>The Monster Venoms table shows the market cost, onset time, save modifier, and effects of monster venoms when applied to missiles and melee weapons. An onset time of instant means the poison takes effect at the end of the attacker’s initiative. An onset time of “one round” means the poison takes effect at the end of the round following the target’s next initiative (e.g. the target gets to act once before the poison affects him).</p>\n<p>Note that baby and juvenile monsters do not have sufficient venom to extract. Adolescent monsters have a full dose of venom.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Monster Venoms</td>\n<td>Onset Time</td>\n<td>Save Modifier</td>\n<td>Effect on Failed Save</td>\n<td>Cost</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Giant Centipede</td>\n<td>1 turn</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td><strong>Incapacitation</strong>, 1d10 turns</td>\n<td>50gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Giant Killer Bee</td>\n<td>1 turn</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td>1d4 {Po} damage</td>\n<td>75gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Spitting Cobra</td>\n<td>1 turn</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td>1d6 {Po} damage</td>\n<td>100gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Giant Crab Spider</td>\n<td>1d8 turns</td>\n<td>+4</td>\n<td>2d6 {Po} damage</td>\n<td>100gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Pit Viper</td>\n<td>1d10 turns</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td>2d6 {Po} damage</td>\n<td>125gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Foul Attercop</td>\n<td>1 turn</td>\n<td>+6</td>\n<td><strong>Paralysis</strong> 1d4 turns + 1d6 {Po} damage</td>\n<td>125gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Giant Parasitic Wasp</td>\n<td>1 turn</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td><strong>Paralysis</strong> 1d6 turns</td>\n<td>175gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Amphisbaena, Child of Nasga</td>\n<td>1d10 turns</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td>4d4 {Po} damage</td>\n<td>200gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Sea Snake</td>\n<td>1d10 turns</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td>4d4 {Po} damage</td>\n<td>200gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>King Cobra</td>\n<td>1d10 turns</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td>4d6 {Po} damage</td>\n<td>250gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Black Widow</td>\n<td>1d4 turns</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td>4d4 {Po} damage</td>\n<td>250gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Hideous Attercop</td>\n<td>1 turn</td>\n<td>+4</td>\n<td><strong>Paralysis</strong> 1d4 turns + 1d8 {Po} damage</td>\n<td>250gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Carrion Horror</td>\n<td>1 turn</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td><strong>Paralysis</strong> 2d4 turns</td>\n<td>300gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Monstrous Attercop</td>\n<td>1 turn</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td><strong>Paralysis</strong> 1d4 turns + 2d6 {Po} damage</td>\n<td>325gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Arane</td>\n<td>1d8 turn</td>\n<td>+1</td>\n<td>6d6 {Po} damage</td>\n<td>350gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Giant Tarantula</td>\n<td>1d4 turns</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td>3d10 {Po} damage</td>\n<td>375gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Giant Scorpion</td>\n<td>1 turn</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td>2d10 {Po} damage</td>\n<td>400gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Giant Rockfish</td>\n<td>1 round</td>\n<td>+1</td>\n<td>5d6 {Po} damage</td>\n<td>450gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Wyvern</td>\n<td>1 round</td>\n<td>+1</td>\n<td>7d6 {Po} damage</td>\n<td>600gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Skittering Maw</td>\n<td>1 round</td>\n<td>+1</td>\n<td>8d6 {Po} damage</td>\n<td>700gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Greater Barghest, Rakshasa</td>\n<td>1 round</td>\n<td>+1</td>\n<td>10d6 {Po} damage</td>\n<td>800gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Demonic Attercop</td>\n<td>1 round</td>\n<td>-3</td>\n<td><strong>Paralysis</strong> 1d4 turns + 5d6 {Po} damage</td>\n<td>1,000gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Giant Constricting Viper</td>\n<td>Instant/1d4+2 turns</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td><strong>Madness</strong> / Death</td>\n<td>1,000gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Giant Black Worm, Dragon</td>\n<td>Instant</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>Death</td>\n<td>1,500gp</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n",

Since the size and stature of a creature’s horns can vary widely based on its age, health, and physical condition, the table provides a set of random ranges as well as average values. Only male mammals should have antlers.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: The Judge is building a lair with an old dragon. The Judge decides to roll randomly for the value of the dragon’s horns. The roll of 1d10x50 yields a result of 450gp for the left horn and 500gp for the right horn, 950gp total. Since an old dragon typically has horns worth around 560gp, this is clearly a large, healthy specimen with a proud crown.</p>\n<p>Horns can be sold or used as raw materials by a weaponsmith. Horns can also be used as precious materials when enchanting magical weapons.</p>\n<p>Horns must be captured intact or they will be worthless. Horns will be intact provided the monster was not damaged with an area-of-effect attack. A character equipped with an axe or other cutting tool can remove a dead or helpless monster’s horns in one round per stone of encumbrance. Before a horn can be sold, it must be properly cleansed, trimmed, and polished. Properly preparing a horn requires Animal Husbandry or Trapping proficiency, and requires 1 turn (10 rounds) per stone encumbrance.</p>\n<p>Monsters in the baby, juvenile, and adolescent age categories never have antlers, horns, or tusks.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: The Zaharan ruinguard Moruvai has slain a unicorn with a 1,500gp horn (1 3/6 stone). It takes him (6 x 9/6) 9 rounds of hacking with his axe to cleave off the precious horn. He departs the site of his atrocity before any do-gooders can punish him. Cleaning, trimming, and polishing the horn will take (60 x 9/6) 90 more rounds (15 minutes), but this he can do later in the comfort of his evil lair.</p>\n"

  "rawMarkdown": "## Monster Parts (Mundane)\n\nSeveral entries on Merchandise tables and Special Treasure tables describe the gp value of meats, hides, furs, and other monster parts. The rules in this section explain how monsters slain in the course of play can be harvested for parts to sell or use. The subsequent section details using monster parts as special components in magic research (see ***ACKS II RR***, p. XX).\n\nAdventurers can identify the value of a monster’s parts with a Naturalism proficiency throw or a Loremastery throw. Adventurers will require certain proficiencies to be able to efficiently harvest a monster’s parts for sale or use; these are noted in each section.\n\nOnce harvested, monster parts may be sold at their market value, subject to the limitations of Equipment Availability in Markets (***ACKS II RR****,* p. 39). Alternatively, monster parts may be sold as trade goods following the rules for Mercantile Ventures (***ACKS II RR****,* p. 142). Adventurers may gain XP from mercantile ventures selling monster parts. Treat the base market value of the monster parts as their cost of the goods sold for the purposes of calculating their mercantile income.\n\n#### Antlers, Horns, and Tusks\n\nSome monsters have antlers, horns, or tusks with decorative, instrumental, or medicinal value (hereafter just called horns, for simplicity). Common animal horns are worth 10gp per stone of weight, while exotic horns are worth 40gp – 100gp per stone of encumbrance.\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Antlers, Horns, and Tusks** | | | | |\n| **Monster** | **Number** | **Encumbrance (st)** | **Value (gp)** | **Avg.

XX. | | | | |\n\nThe Antler, Horn, and Tusk table catalogs which monsters have notably valuable antlers, horns, and tusks, along with their respective number, weights, and values. Since the size and stature of a creature’s horns can vary widely based on its age, health, and physical condition, the table provides a set of random ranges as well as average values. Only male mammals should have antlers.\n\nEXAMPLE: The Judge is building a lair with an old dragon. The Judge decides to roll randomly for the value of the dragon’s horns. The roll of 1d10x50 yields a result of 450gp for the left horn and 500gp for the right horn, 950gp total. Since an old dragon typically has horns worth around 560gp, this is clearly a large, healthy specimen with a proud crown.\n\nHorns can be sold or used as raw materials by a weaponsmith. Horns can also be used as precious materials when enchanting magical weapons.\n\nHorns must be captured intact or they will be worthless. Horns will be intact provided the monster was not damaged with an area-of-effect attack. A character equipped with an axe or other cutting tool can remove a dead or helpless monster’s horns in one round per stone of encumbrance. Before a horn can be sold, it must be properly cleansed, trimmed, and polished. Properly preparing a horn requires Animal Husbandry or Trapping proficiency, and requires 1 turn (10 rounds) per stone encumbrance.\n\nMonsters in the baby, juvenile, and adolescent age categories never have antlers, horns, or tusks.\n\nEXAMPLE: The Zaharan ruinguard Moruvai has slain a unicorn with a 1,500gp horn (1 3/6 stone). It takes him (6 x 9/6) 9 rounds of hacking with his axe to cleave off the precious horn. He departs the site of his atrocity before any do-gooders can punish him. Cleaning, trimming, and polishing the horn will take (60 x 9/6) 90 more rounds (15 minutes), but this he can do later in the comfort of his evil lair.\n\n#### Claws, Fangs, Stingers, Tails, and Talons\n\nWhile most claws, fangs, stingers, tails, and talons are of little interest, a few monsters have particularly fierce natural weapons. These are often prized as museum pieces, trophies, or fetishes.\n\nA prized natural weapon is worth a number of gp equal to the maximum damage it can deal. For exceptional monsters with STR of 13 or more, include the damage bonus from high STR into the weapons’ damage when calculating its value. Natural weapons have an encumbrance of 1/6 stone per 10gp.\n\n###### Claws/Talons\n\nClaws/talons are prized if the monster’s claw/talon attack can:\n\n* break bone, eviscerate, or maim targets; or\n* grab and carry man-sized or larger targets\n\n###### Fangs\n\nFangs are prized if the monster’s bite attack can:\n\n* break bones, eviscerate, or maim targets\n* inject acid or poison; or\n* swallow man-sized or larger targets\n\nFor game purposes “fangs” collectively encompasses all of the creature’s mouthparts, such as beaks, cuspids, incisors, mandibles, maxillae, molars, etc. Note that particularly impressive teeth are handled as tusks under Antlers, Horns, and Tusks, above.\n\n###### Stinger\n\nStingers are prized if the monster’s sting attack can inject acid or poison into a target.\n\n#### Feathers and Plumage\n\nSome monsters and animals may have large, colorful feathers that command a high value – typically 1gp to 6gp in value each, with an encumbrance of 1 stone per 25 feathers. Feathers of some particularly impressive monsters can be even larger and more valuable. The feathers of a giant roc can be up to 20’ long and worth 120gp each!\n\nFeathers can be sold or used as raw materials by a fletcher. Feathers can also be used to pay the material cost of magical arrows or cloaks.\n\nAs with fur pelts, feathers must be captured intact to maintain their value. Feathers will be intact provided the monster was not damaged with an area-of-effect attack. Damaged feathers are worthless. Plucking feathers takes 1 turn per stone of feathers.\n\nThe Feathers and Plumage table catalogs which monsters have valuable feathers. Although feathered creatures have anywhere from 1,000 to 25,000 feathers, only a small percentage have notable market value: the 10 primary and 14 secondary flight feathers of each wing, and the 12 flight feathers of the tail (60 total). Crossbreeds have fewer feathers, depending on their body form. Some feathers may be damaged by age, weather, illness, or battle, so the table provides a set of random ranges as well as typical value for a monster’s plumage.\n\nBaby, juvenile, and adolescent monsters have feathers worth 25%, 50%, and 75% of the value of an adult monster.\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Feathers and Plumage** | | | | | |\n| **Monster** | **No. of Feathers** | **Feather Length** | **Feathers per Stone** | **Value (per feather)** | **Typical Plumage** |\n| Faravahar\\* | 6d10 | 40” – 75” | 12 | 2d6 gp | 33 feathers, 230gp and 2 4/6 st |\n| Griffon\\* | 4d12\\* | 42” – 82” | 12 | 2d6 gp | 24 feathers, 170gp and 2 st |\n| Gorgon\\* | 4d12\\* | 42” – 82” | 12 | 2d6 gp | 24 feathers, 170gp and 2 st |\n| Harpy\\* | 4d12 | 40” – 54” | 25 | 1d6 gp | 25 feathers, 90gp and 1 st |\n| Hippogriff\\* | 4d12\\* | 54” – 102” | 8 | 3d6 gp | 24 feathers, 250gp and 3 st |\n| Lammasu\\* | 4d12 | 42” – 82” | 12 | 2d6 gp | 24 feathers, 170gp and 2 st |\n| Ostrich | 6d10 | 11” – 22” | 150 | 1d3 sp | 33 feathers, 66sp, 1/6 st |\n| Ostrich, Giant | 6d10 | 29” – 55” | 25 | 1d6gp | 33 feathers, 115gp and 1 2/6 st |\n| Owlbeast | 3d10 | 29” – 55” | 25 | 1d6 gp | 16 feathers, 60gp and 4/6 st |\n| Pegasus\\* | 4d12\\* | 62” – 116” | 6 | 4d6 gp | 24 feathers, 335gp and 4 st |\n| Raptor, Giant | 6d10 | 29” – 55” | 25 | 1d6 gp | 33 feathers, 115gp and 1 2/6 st |\n| Raptor, Large | 6d10 | 11” – 22” | 150 | 1d3 sp | 33 feathers, 66sp, 1/6 st |\n| Raptor, Med. | 6d10 | 7” – 15” | 225 | 1d2 sp | 33 feathers, 5gp and 1/6 st |\n| Roc, Giant | 6d10 | 11’ – 20’ | 1 | 6d20 gp | 33 feathers, 2,100gp and 33st |\n| Roc, Large | 6d10\\* | 6’ – 12’ | 4 | 7d6 gp | 33 feathers, 800gp and 8 2/6st |\n| Roc, Small | 6d10 | 51” – 94” | 8 | 3d6 gp | 33 feathers, 350gp and 4st |\n| Sphinx\\* | 4d12\\* | 70” – 128” | 5 | 4d8 gp | 25 feathers, 450gp and 5 st |\n| Strix | 6d10 | 7” – 15” | 225 | 1d2 sp | 33 feathers, 5gp and 1/6 st |\n| Stymph\\* | 6d10 | 7” – 15” | 225 | 1d2 sp | 33 feathers, 5gp and 1/6 st |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| \\*Feathers may also be valuable as special components, see p. XX. | | | | | |\n\n#### Pelts and Meats\n\nAdventurers may skin, flesh, and butcher slain monsters in order to harvest their pelts and meat. The time required for this labor, and the weight and value of the resulting product, is based on the monster’s weight, as shown on the Skinning, Fleshing, and Butchering table, below. Adventurers must have one of the following proficiencies in order to properly prepare animal products: Animal Husbandry, Labor (butchery), Labor (farming), or Trapping. If not, the time required for each process is doubled, and the amount yielded is halved. If desired, adventurers may collaborate in butchering monsters, dividing its weight amongst themselves. All participating characters must have the appropriate craftsman’s tools (even if they are unproficient).\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Process** | **Time Required (turns)** | **Product** | **Amount Yielded (st)** | **Value (gp)** |\n| Skinning and Fleshing | Monster Weight in lbs. / 10 | Pelt | 0.00265 x Monster Weight in lbs. | 1 x Pelt Encumbrance |\n| Butchering | Monster Weight in lbs. / 5 | Meat | 0.0265 x Monster Weight in lbs. | 0.3 x Meat Encumbrance |\n\nEXAMPLE: Sorcha, a ranger with Trapping proficiency, kills a 600-pound dire wolf. It will take her (600/10) 60 turns to skin the animal, or about 10 hours. The dire wolf’s pelt will weigh (0.00265 x 600) 1.59 stone and be worth (1 x 1.59) 1.59gp. She can then butcher the dire wolf’s carcass, which will take her (600/5) 120 turns, about 20 hours. Butchering the dire wolf yields (0.0265 x 600) 15.9 stone of wolf meat, worth (0.3 x 15.9) 4.8gp. Her total profit on 30 hours of labor is 6.39gp. If Sorcha did not have Trapping proficiency, these tasks would take twice as long and yield half the value.\n\nAdventurers can hire laborers at a rate of 1sp per 8 hours to skin, flesh, and butcher their kills for them. The labor cost will work out to 0.000625gp x Monster Weight, and the net profit for the adventurers will work out to 0.01gp x Monster Weight.\n\nEXAMPLE: Sorcha hires a laborer to skin, flesh, and butcher the slain dire wolf. Since the wolf weighs 600 lbs, the laborer charges (600 x .000625) 0.38gp. That is, her laborer charges 1sp every 8 hours; 30 hours of his labor costs (1sp/8 hours x 30 hours) 3.8sp or 0.38gp. Sorcha’s net profit is (6.39gp – 0.38gp) or 6.01gp. Sorcha has tediously determined that she is, indeed, earning 0.1gp per pound of monster.\n\nDecimal stone weights should be converted to items for encumbrance purposes by rounding to the nearest 1/6.\n\n#### Rugs, Capes, Coats, and Trophies\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Good** | **Value (gp)** | **Enc. (st)** | **# of Pelts Required** |\n| Rug | 2d4 x Pelt Value | Pelt Weight(s) | 1 / Pelt Weight (rounded up) |\n| Cape | 4d6 x Pelt Value | 1 | 2 / Pelt Weight (rounded up) |\n| Coat | 1d6 x 10 x Pelt Value | 1 | 3 / Pelt Weight (rounded up) |\n| Trophy | 3d4 x Pelt Value | Pelt Weight x 7 | 1 |\n\nPelts can be cut and sewn into rugs, capes, and coats, or stuffed and mounted as trophies. The value and encumbrance of rugs, capes, coats, and trophies is based on the pelt used. Sewing or stuffing is a construction project with a labor cost equal to the final value less the value of the pelts used (see ***ACKS II RR****,* XX).\n\nEXAMPLE: Sorcha’s dire wolf pelt weighs 1.6 stone and is worth 159cp. She could have it made into a rug worth 318cp to 1,272cp and weighing 1.6 stone; or stuffed as a trophy mount worth 477cp to 1,908cp and weighing 11.2st. She would need 2 pelts to make a cape and 3 to make a coat. She hires a master furrier to sew the pelt into a rug worth 1,159cp. The furrier’s construction rate is 1gp per day, equaling 100cp per day. It takes the furrier [1,159cp – 159cp) / 100cp per day] 10 days.\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Foe Fur** | | | | | |\n| **Monster** | **Enc.

In general, such **fur pelts** are worth 5gp per stone of encumbrance or more. Particularly rare fur pelts are worth as much as 100gp per stone of encumbrance.\n\nThe Foe Fur table catalogs which monsters have notably valuable pelts, along with their respective values and encumbrance.\n\nAdventurers who want a fur pelt must take great care when killing the monster. A monster’s carcass will yield an intact fur pelt only if:\n\n* The monster was slain with just one attack; or\n* The monster was slain entirely with blunt weapons; or\n* The monster was slain by cold, death magic, electricity, or poison, and lost less than half its hit points to other attacks.\n\nDamaged fur pelts are worth just 1gp per stone. Like normal pelts, fur pelts must be skinned and fleshed before they can be sold. Fur pelts can be used to make valuable rugs, capes, coats, and trophies.\n\nEXAMPLE: If Sorcha had slain the dire wolf entirely with blunt weapons, its pelt would have been worth 50gp instead of 1.59gp.\n\n###### Armored Hides\n\nSome monster pelts are so thick, durable, or hard that they can be used to forge armor. These **armored hides** can be sold or used as raw materials by an armorer. (Raw materials reduce the labor cost of a construction project by their value, to a maximum 25% of the total cost of the construction project; see *D@W: Campaigns,* p. 51). Armored hides can be used to pay material costs when enchanting magical armor and shields.\n\nThe Monster Armored Hide table catalogs which monsters have armored hides, along with their respective values and encumbrance. Like all pelts, armored hides must be skinned and fleshed (see p. XX).\n\nAs with fur pelts, armored hides must be captured intact to maintain their value. A monster’s armored hide will only be intact if:\n\n* The monster was slain with just one attack; or\n* The monster was slain by cold, death magic, electricity, or poison and lost half its hit points or less to other attacks.\n\nDamaged armored pelts are worth just 1gp per stone. Like all pelts, armored hides must be skinned and fleshed (see p. XX).\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Armored Hides** | | |\n| **Monster** | **Hide Enc.

Unless otherwise noted, baby, juvenile, and adolescent monsters have pelts and meat worth 25%, 50%, and 75% of the value of an adult monster.\n\n###### Extraordinary Pelts\n\nMonsters with high STR, CON, or CHA will have more valuable pelts than normal creatures of their type. If STR, CON, or CHA are 13-15, add 25% to the value of the monster’s pelt. If STR, CON, or CHA are 16-17, add 100% to the value. If STR, CON, or CHA are 18, add 400% to the value. The bonus from ability scores stacks.\n\nEXAMPLE: The adventurers have slain a particularly large and impressive mammoth (STR 16, CHA 14). A normal mammoth’s hide is worth 350gp. This mammoth’s hide is worth 350gp + (25% x 350gp) + (100% x 350gp), or 787gp.\n\nMonsters with low STR, CON, or CHA will have less valuable pelts. If STR, CON, or CHA are 3, reduce the value of the monster’s pelt by 75%. If STR, CON, or CHA are 4-5, reduce the value by 50%. If STR, CON, or CHA are 6-8, reduce the value by 25%. The penalty from ability scores stacks. If the penalty reduces the value to 0 or less, the pelt is simply worthless.\n\n#### Venoms\n\nCharacters with Naturalism proficiency can identify venomous monsters and distinguish their different poisons with a successful proficiency throw of 11+. Extracting venom from a slain monster requires 1 hour of ancillary activity and a successful Animal Husbandry proficiency throw of 18+. The character gains a +4 bonus to the throw per additional rank of Animal Husbandry. If the throw fails, the character can try again. If the character’s proficiency throw to extract venom is an unmodified 1, he has accidentally gotten scratched by a fang or stinger. The character must immediately save versus Poison, as if hit by the monster.\n\nOnce extracted, monster venoms can be applied to weapons. Each monster yields one dose of its venom. A dose is enough venom to treat twenty missiles (arrows, bolts, or darts) or one melee weapon. Note that venoms applied to missiles and melee weapons are not as effective as they are when coming from the monster itself. Venomous monsters penetrate their prey’s skin with hollow fangs or tubular stingers, then use muscles attached to their venom reservoirs to forcibly squirt venom deep within the target’s body tissue. In comparison, a sword or arrow is simply a less effective mechanism for delivering poison.\n\nThe Monster Venoms table shows the market cost, onset time, save modifier, and effects of monster venoms when applied to missiles and melee weapons. An onset time of instant means the poison takes effect at the end of the attacker’s initiative. An onset time of “one round” means the poison takes effect at the end of the round following the target’s next initiative (e.g. the target gets to act once before the poison affects him).\n\nNote that baby and juvenile monsters do not have sufficient venom to extract. Adolescent monsters have a full dose of venom.\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monster Venoms | Onset Time | Save Modifier | Effect on Failed Save | Cost |\n| Giant Centipede | 1 turn | +2 | **Incapacitation**, 1d10 turns | 50gp |\n| Giant Killer Bee | 1 turn | +2 | 1d4 {Po} damage | 75gp |\n| Spitting Cobra | 1 turn | +2 | 1d6 {Po} damage | 100gp |\n| Giant Crab Spider | 1d8 turns | +4 | 2d6 {Po} damage | 100gp |\n| Pit Viper | 1d10 turns | +2 | 2d6 {Po} damage | 125gp |\n| Foul Attercop | 1 turn | +6 | **Paralysis** 1d4 turns + 1d6 {Po} damage | 125gp |\n| Giant Parasitic Wasp | 1 turn | 0 | **Paralysis** 1d6 turns | 175gp |\n| Amphisbaena, Child of Nasga | 1d10 turns | +2 | 4d4 {Po} damage | 200gp |\n| Sea Snake | 1d10 turns | +2 | 4d4 {Po} damage | 200gp |\n| King Cobra | 1d10 turns | +2 | 4d6 {Po} damage | 250gp |\n| Black Widow | 1d4 turns | +2 | 4d4 {Po} damage | 250gp |\n| Hideous Attercop | 1 turn | +4 | **Paralysis** 1d4 turns + 1d8 {Po} damage | 250gp |\n| Carrion Horror | 1 turn | +2 | **Paralysis** 2d4 turns | 300gp |\n| Monstrous Attercop | 1 turn | 0 | **Paralysis** 1d4 turns + 2d6 {Po} damage | 325gp |\n| Arane | 1d8 turn | +1 | 6d6 {Po} damage | 350gp |\n| Giant Tarantula | 1d4 turns | +2 | 3d10 {Po} damage | 375gp |\n| Giant Scorpion | 1 turn | +2 | 2d10 {Po} damage | 400gp |\n| Giant Rockfish | 1 round | +1 | 5d6 {Po} damage | 450gp |\n| Wyvern | 1 round | +1 | 7d6 {Po} damage | 600gp |\n| Skittering Maw | 1 round | +1 | 8d6 {Po} damage | 700gp |\n| Greater Barghest, Rakshasa | 1 round | +1 | 10d6 {Po} damage | 800gp |\n| Demonic Attercop | 1 round | -3 | **Paralysis** 1d4 turns + 5d6 {Po} damage | 1,000gp |\n| Giant Constricting Viper | Instant/1d4+2 turns | 0 | **Madness** / Death | 1,000gp |\n| Giant Black Worm, Dragon | Instant | 0 | Death | 1,500gp |\n"
