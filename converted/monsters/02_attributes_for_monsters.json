A dragon turtle with STR 18 has its maximum load increased by [3 x (2,300/10)] 414 stone to 5,014 stone.</p>\n<h3>Intelligence</h3>\n<p>Monsters can be mindless, bestial, semi-sapient, or sapient. Sapient monsters, such as giants, humanoids, most undead (except skeletons and zombies), and some monstrosities, can gain bonus proficiencies and languages from an Intelligence bonus just as a human or demi-human character does. A sapient monster that casts arcane spells (such as dragons) can increase the number of spells of each level in its repertoire by its Intelligence bonus.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: A mature adult dragon capable of speech has a repertoire of 2 1st, 2 2nd, and 2 3rd level spells. A mature adult dragon with INT 16 has its repertoire increased to 4 1st, 4 2nd, and 4 3rd level spells.</p>\n<p>Semi-sapient and bestial monsters do not gain proficiencies, languages, or spells from their INT bonus. The monster’s Intelligence instead determines how easy the monster is to train. The number of tricks such a monster may be taught by an animal trainer is equal to 5 plus the INT bonus or penalty. The number of tricks therefore ranges from 2 to 8. Some monsters are innately more or less trainable and have a <strong>trainability modifier</strong> applied to their maximum number of tricks. See <strong>Taming and Training Monsters</strong>, below, for more details.</p>\n<p><em>“Tim is In Trouble” Memorial Rule:</em> If a creature of bestial intelligence has a combined INT modifier plus trainability modifierof 3 or more, it can (at your discretion) be considered semi-sapient and capable of learning primitive communication, simple math, and basic tool use.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: Tim, an enchanter, is the proud owner of Lacey, a hunting dog (trainability modifier +2) of unusual intelligence for her kind (INT 18). Because Lacey’s combined INT and trainability modifiers combine to 5, she is semi-sapient. Thus, when Tim falls down a 10’ pit, Lacey is able to rush to his companions and alert them that Tim is in trouble with sharp barks, even though she hasn’t been taught a trick to do this.</p>\n<p>Mindless monsters, such as most constructs (except gargoyles) and all oozes, do not have Intelligence scores or trainability modifiers.</p>\n<h3>Dexterity</h3>\n<p>Non-humanoid monsters have their speed adjusted by their DEX modifier. The creature’s encounter speed is adjusted by 10’ x DEX bonus x (Speed/120’). Its combat speed is adjusted by one-third the encounter speed adjustment. A creature’s ability to travel long distances quickly is limited by its stamina as well as its speed, so its expedition speed is adjusted by the lower of DEX or CON bonus x 2 miles x (Speed/120’).</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: A light horse has an encounter speed of 240’, combat speed of 80’, and wilderness rate of 48 miles per day. A light horse with DEX 18 (+3 bonus) and CON 14 (+1) has its encounter speed adjusted by (10’ x 3 x 240’ / 120’) = 60’, yielding an adjusted encounter speed of 300’. Its combat speed is increased from 80’ by (60’/3) to 100’. Its expedition speed is limited by its CON bonus of +1, so it is increased by just (1 x 2 x 240’/120’) 2 miles, to 50 miles per day.</p>\n<h3>Constitution</h3>\n<p>For monsters other than constructs and undead, the CON score represents general health and vitality. For constructs, the CON score represents the sturdiness of construction. For undead, the CON score represents the negative animus which sustains its baneful existence. In all cases, the bonus or penalty from Constitution is added as a modifier to each Hit Die roll. (Monsters who have advanced in HD beyond the maximum permitted for their size may not apply their CON modifier towards those HD; see p. XX.)</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: A storm giant has 15 HD, so it rolls 15d8 for its hit points. If the storm giant has CON 16, it will roll 15d8+30 for its hit points.</p>\n<h3>Charisma</h3>\n<p>Add the monster’s Charisma bonus or penalty to its morale score and to the morale score of any monsters it leads. Mindless monsters (such as skeletons) do not have Charisma scores.</p>\n",

For simplicity, we assume most monsters are average specimens of their species, with ability scores of 9 in all characteristics. Note that a monster’s ability scores are *not* measured against the human average. A horse with INT 18 is smart *for a horse*,but is not capable of tool use or mathematics*.* A giant with STR 7 is quite weak *for a giant*, but is still considerably stronger than a man!\n\nAs with human and demi-human characters, a monstrous ability score of less than 9 or greater than 12 will provide a bonus or penalty on rolls and throws related to the ability score. Except as noted below, the bonus or penalty is identical to that for human and demi-human characters.\n\n### Strength\n\nThe bonus or penalty to attack throws and damage rolls is adjusted by how damaging the monster’s natural attacks are. Cross-reference the monster’s STR score with its average damage from each natural attack on the table below to find the bonus or penalty to the attack throws and damage rolls.\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Ability Score** | **2 or less** | **3 – 6** | **7-12** | **13-24** | **25 or more** |\n| 3 | -2 | -3 | -6 | -8 | -12 |\n| 4 | -1 | -2 | -5 | -7 | -10 |\n| 5 | -1 | -2 | -4 | -6 | -8 |\n| 6 | 0 | -1 | -3 | -4 | -6 |\n| 7 | 0 | -1 | -2 | -3 | -4 |\n| 8 | 0 | -1 | -1 | -2 | -3 |\n| 9 | 0 | 0 | 0 | -1 | -2 |\n| 10 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| 11 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| 12 | 0 | 0 | 0 | +1 | +2 |\n| 13 | 0 | +1 | +1 | +2 | +3 |\n| 14 | 0 | +1 | +2 | +3 | +4 |\n| 15 | 0 | +1 | +3 | +4 | +6 |\n| 16 | +1 | +2 | +4 | +6 | +8 |\n| 17 | +1 | +2 | +5 | +7 | +10 |\n| 18 | +2 | +3 | +6 | +8 | +12 |\n\nEXAMPLE #1: A dragon turtle deals 1d8 points of damage (4.5 average) with its claws and 1d6x10 (35 average) with its bite. A dragon turtle with STR 18 gets +3 to hit and damage with its claws and +12 to hit and damage with its bite.\n\nEXAMPLE #2: A medium raptor deals 1d2 points of damage (1.5 average) with its talons. A medium raptor with STR 4 has -1 to hit and damage with its talons. A medium raptor with STR 18 has +2 to hit and damage.\n\nA creature’s maximum load is adjusted by its STR modifier x (normal load/10). (Most creatures have a maximum load equal to twice their normal load, see p. XX). A humanoid creature’s maximum load is adjusted by its STR modifier x (normal load/5), rounded to the nearest stone. Round 0.5 up if negative, down if positive.\n\nEXAMPLE #1: A dragon turtle has a normal load of 2,300 stone. Therefore, it has a maximum load of 4,600 stone. A dragon turtle with STR 18 has its maximum load increased by [3 x (2,300/10)] 414 stone to 5,014 stone.\n\n### Intelligence\n\nMonsters can be mindless, bestial, semi-sapient, or sapient. Sapient monsters, such as giants, humanoids, most undead (except skeletons and zombies), and some monstrosities, can gain bonus proficiencies and languages from an Intelligence bonus just as a human or demi-human character does. A sapient monster that casts arcane spells (such as dragons) can increase the number of spells of each level in its repertoire by its Intelligence bonus.\n\nEXAMPLE: A mature adult dragon capable of speech has a repertoire of 2 1st, 2 2nd, and 2 3rd level spells. A mature adult dragon with INT 16 has its repertoire increased to 4 1st, 4 2nd, and 4 3rd level spells.\n\nSemi-sapient and bestial monsters do not gain proficiencies, languages, or spells from their INT bonus. The monster’s Intelligence instead determines how easy the monster is to train. The number of tricks such a monster may be taught by an animal trainer is equal to 5 plus the INT bonus or penalty. The number of tricks therefore ranges from 2 to 8. Some monsters are innately more or less trainable and have a **trainability modifier** applied to their maximum number of tricks. See **Taming and Training Monsters**, below, for more details.\n\n*“Tim is In Trouble” Memorial Rule:* If a creature of bestial intelligence has a combined INT modifier plus trainability modifierof 3 or more, it can (at your discretion) be considered semi-sapient and capable of learning primitive communication, simple math, and basic tool use.\n\nEXAMPLE: Tim, an enchanter, is the proud owner of Lacey, a hunting dog (trainability modifier +2) of unusual intelligence for her kind (INT 18).

The creature’s encounter speed is adjusted by 10’ x DEX bonus x (Speed/120’). Its combat speed is adjusted by one-third the encounter speed adjustment. A creature’s ability to travel long distances quickly is limited by its stamina as well as its speed, so its expedition speed is adjusted by the lower of DEX or CON bonus x 2 miles x (Speed/120’).\n\nEXAMPLE: A light horse has an encounter speed of 240’, combat speed of 80’, and wilderness rate of 48 miles per day. A light horse with DEX 18 (+3 bonus) and CON 14 (+1) has its encounter speed adjusted by (10’ x 3 x 240’ / 120’) = 60’, yielding an adjusted encounter speed of 300’. Its combat speed is increased from 80’ by (60’/3) to 100’. Its expedition speed is limited by its CON bonus of +1, so it is increased by just (1 x 2 x 240’/120’) 2 miles, to 50 miles per day.\n\n### Constitution\n\nFor monsters other than constructs and undead, the CON score represents general health and vitality. For constructs, the CON score represents the sturdiness of construction. For undead, the CON score represents the negative animus which sustains its baneful existence. In all cases, the bonus or penalty from Constitution is added as a modifier to each Hit Die roll. (Monsters who have advanced in HD beyond the maximum permitted for their size may not apply their CON modifier towards those HD; see p. XX.)\n\nEXAMPLE: A storm giant has 15 HD, so it rolls 15d8 for its hit points. If the storm giant has CON 16, it will roll 15d8+30 for its hit points.\n\n### Charisma\n\nAdd the monster’s Charisma bonus or penalty to its morale score and to the morale score of any monsters it leads. Mindless monsters (such as skeletons) do not have Charisma scores.\n"
