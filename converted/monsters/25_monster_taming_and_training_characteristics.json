XX) introduces several new characteristics for monsters, including lifespan, supply cost, trained value, untrained adult value, child value, and baby value. While not strictly necessary, these characteristics can be useful to know in campaign play.</p>\n<h3>Monster Lifespan</h3>\n<p>The age categories that constitute a monster’s lifespan are calculated by working backwards from the monster’s maximum age. Three methods are available to compute maximum lifespan for a new monster:</p>\n<p>First, there is a known correlation between a creature’s full-grown weight and its maximum lifespan. Starting with the new monster’s weight in pounds (calculated on p. XX), its maximum lifespan in years will approximate 10.14 x (Monster Weight/2.2)0.18. This formula is most accurate for common mammals. Monsters with high brain mass (intelligence) will tend to live longer than this formula indicates, as will birds and reptiles.</p>\n<p>Second, if the new monster is very similar to an existing creature with a known lifespan and weight, the new monster’s lifespan in years can be calculated as a ratio of that baseline. The formula is New Monster Maximum Lifespan = Baseline Monster Lifespan x (New Monster Weight/Baseline Monster Weight)0.25</p>\n<p>Third, if the new monster is based on a real-world creature, or a creature from myth and legend, that has a known or reputed lifespan, that value can simply be used. Powerful monsters with many special abilities should usually be given a very long life span, as this helps rationalize in-world why they are not bred in captivity at a wide scale.</p>\n<p>Once the monster’s maximum lifespan is known, its other age categories can be calculated using the table below. These percentages are based on averages across all monsters in the <em><strong>ACKS II MM</strong></em>so many monsters vary from these proportions. If desired, you can set the monster’s age categories by hand, or model them on a similar monster’s age categories.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Baby</td>\n<td>Juvenile</td>\n<td>Adolescent</td>\n<td>Adult</td>\n<td>Middle-Aged</td>\n<td>Old</td>\n<td>Ancient</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>0% Of Maximum</td>\n<td>1% Maximum</td>\n<td>5% Maximum</td>\n<td>10% Maximum</td>\n<td>40% Maximum</td>\n<td>60% Maximum</td>\n<td>80% Maximum</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>EXAMPLE: The crawling horror is a 10 HD monster with the scolopendrine body form, weighing 1,100 lbs. The Judge calculates that his monster has a weight-based maximum lifespan of [10.14 x (1,100/2.2)0.18] = 31 years. Since Scolopendrine monsters are essentially giant centipedes, he looks up the maximum lifespan and weight of a centipede on the internet. He finds that centipedes live a surprisingly-long 5 years despite weighing just 140 milligrams (0.0003 lbs). Using that as a baseline, he determines that the maximum lifespan of his 10 HD monster will be (5 years) x (1,100 lbs / 0.0003 lbs)0.25 = 219 years. He chooses to use the latter value, rounded to 220 years. From there, he calculates the monster’s lifespan as 0/2/11/22/88/132/176/220.</p>\n<h3>Trained Value and Battle Rating</h3>\n<p>The trained value is, in most cases, calculated from its battle rating (BR), with various adjustments applied if the monster requires expensive supplies or handlers. <em><strong>Domains at War: Battles</strong></em>, available separately,includes detailed rules on how to calculate a monster’s BR, monthly wage, and value. Judges without access to <em><strong>Domains at War: Battles</strong></em><em>,</em> or who simply prefer to avoid the complex calculations therein, can use the following simplified formulas to estimate trained value and BR:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Trained Value = (Creature’s AC/2+1) x (Creature’s HD) x (Creature’s average damage/2) x (1 + Creature’s # of special abilities) x 24</li>\n<li>BR = Trained Value / 24,000</li>\n</ul>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Characteristic</td>\n<td>Special Multiplier</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Monster is bestial or mindless and not a mount</td>\n<td>x0.5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Monster can fly at speed of 240’ or less</td>\n<td>x2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Monster can fly at speed more than 240’</td>\n<td>x4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Monster can carry riders weighing 20 st. or more</td>\n<td>x2*</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>*Bonus does not increase BR</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>Only special abilities that warrant an asterisk (*) count for these purposes. Before calculating BR, apply any applicable special multipliers from the adjoining table. Round calculated values of 10,000gp or less to the nearest 100gp, and larger values to the nearest 250gp.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE #1: A giant acanthaspis has AC 8, 5 HD, deals an average of 10 damage, and has 2 special abilities. It’s of bestial intelligence. Therefore the trained value is (8/2 +1) x (5) x (10/2) x (1 + 2) x 24 = 9,000gp. Because it’s of bestial intelligence, its estimated trained value is halved to 4,500gp. Its estimated BR is 4,500 / 24,000 = 0.1875. In comparison, the official values for a giant acanthaspis are 4,235gp and 0.236 respectively.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE #2: A small roc has AC 5, HD 6, deals an average of 14 damage, and has 1 special ability. It’s of sapient intelligence. It can fly at 480’ carrying a rider weighing 20 st. or more. Therefore the trained value is (5/2 +1) x (6) x (14/2) x (1 +1) x 24 = 7,056gp. Because it can fly at 480’ carrying a rider, its estimated value is then multiplied by x8 to 56,448, rounded to 56,500gp. However, its BR is calculated as [ (56,500 / 2) / 24,000] = 1.177. In comparison, the official values are 65,000gp and 1.288 respectively.</p>\n<p>Trained values estimated using the formula above will not always be so close to the value derived using <em>Domains at War: Battles.</em> Monsters with exceptional HD, special abilities, spellcasting, or other characteristics can vary greatly, so use common sense when making the estimate. In addition, some monsters have such unusual abilities that their value is driven by other factors.</p>\n<h3>Untrained Values</h3>\n<p>The untrained adult, juvenile, and child values in the <em><strong>ACKS II MM</strong></em> were calculated with a robust spreadsheet that takes into account the net present value of money based on the monster’s ages, the changing cost of food as the monster grows, the cost to train the monster, and more. (If there is interest within the <em>ACKS</em> community we may work to develop an online calculator for our Judges.) The following paragraphs offer suggestions on how to estimate these values.</p>\n<p>To estimate the untrained adult values of a monster, start by checking if it is sapient or not. If the monster is sapient, its untrained adult value will be the greater of the monster’s normal load x 8gp or the value of the monster’s spoils. If the monster is not sapient, its untrained value will be the greater of its trained value less the cost to train it, its normal load x 4gp, or its spoils value. Across all monsters in the <em><strong>ACKS II MM</strong></em>, the untrained value of monsters averages around 10% its trained value.</p>\n<p>To estimate the untrained juvenile and baby values of a monster, benchmark it against a creature with a similar diet, size, and lifecycle. If all else fails, go with an average -- across all monsters in the <em><strong>ACKS II MM</strong></em>, the juvenile and baby values of a monster average around 40% and 20% of its untrained value or 4% and 2% of its trained value, respectively.</p>\n",
