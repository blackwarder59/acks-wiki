  "html": "<h2>Monster Types</h2>\n<p>Monsters with similar characteristics are grouped into <strong>monster types</strong>. The monster types are <strong>animal</strong>, <strong>beastman</strong>, <strong>construct</strong>, <strong>enchanted creature</strong>, <strong>giant humanoid</strong>, <strong>humanoid</strong>, <strong>incarnation</strong>, <strong>monstrosity</strong>, <strong>ooze</strong>, <strong>undead</strong>, and <strong>vermin</strong>. Monster type determines the effectiveness of various spells against the creature. Some monsters belong to multiple types, in the following combinations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A beastman can be a giant (noted as giant beastman) or humanoid (noted as humanoid beastman).</li>\n<li>A construct can be an undead (noted as undead construct).</li>\n<li>Any type of monster can be an enchanted creature (noted as enchanted [type]). Constructs, incarnations and undead creatures are always enchanted creatures and hence not called out as such.</li>\n<li>Some monsters have a sub-type noted in parentheses such as (Demon).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Animal</h3>\n<p>Animals are a type of monster that includes baboons, bats, bears, boars, camels, cats, crocodiles, devil rays, dogs, dolphins, elephants, ferrets, fish, frogs, gorillas, herd animals, hippos, horses, hyenas, jackals, lizards, mules, octopuses, raptors, rats, rays, rhinoceroses, seals, sharks, shrews, snakes, squids, turtles, toads, weasels, whales, wolves, and any other creatures of sub-human intelligence that occur in the real world. Giant animals are merely larger version of normal animals, and therefore part of this type. (They are not Giant type.) Prehistoric animals, such as cave bears, mammoths, and saber-toothed tigers are also animals. <em>Bewitch beast, speak with beasts,</em> and related magic items only work on animals. Animals are also vulnerable to <em>bewitch monster</em>and <em>halt monster</em>spells. An animal reduced to 0 hp is left unconscious and possibly slain.</p>\n<h3>Beastman</h3>\n<p>Beastmen are a special type of monster that were created through ancient magic by blending a humanoid with an animal or monstrosity. Beastmen include bugbears, centaurs, gnolls, goblins, hobgoblins, hobgholls, kobolds, lizardmen, minotaurs, ogres, orcs, thrassians, tritons, trolls, and troglodytes. All beastmen are also either giants or humanoids. A beastman reduced to 0 hp is left unconscious and possibly slain.</p>\n<h3>Construct</h3>\n<p>Constructs are a type of unliving monster, usually mindless, that includes animated statues, blood hounds, bronze bulls, death chargers, flay fiends, gargoyles, golems, living ancestors, necropedes, skeletons, venous sentinels, and zombies. Note that some constructs are undead. Because they are not truly alive, constructs are immune to enchantment effects, necrotic damage, and poisonous damage. All constructs are enchanted creatures for purposes of spells such as <em>dispel evil</em>and <em>holy circle</em>. A construct reduced to 0 hp is destroyed.</p>\n<h3>Enchanted Creature</h3>\n<p>Enchanted creatures are a special type of monster that can be kept at bay by <em>holy circle</em>and, depending on alignment, detected by <em>discern evil</em> and destroyed or driven off by <em>dispel evil.</em> All constructs, incarnations, and undead are enchanted creatures, as are certain other creatures noted as such in their listing. Conjured or summoned creature are temporarily considered enchanted for the duration of the spell, regardless of type. Called creatures are not considered enchanted creatures, however.</p>\n<h3>Giants</h3>\n<p>Giants are creatures that would be humanoids were it not for their great size and 5 or more Hit Dice. Giants include cyclops, ettin, giants, titans, and trolls. Giants cannot be affected by enchantments that target humanoids (e.g. <em>bewitch humanoid</em>) but are usually vulnerable to enchantments that can affect living creatures in general (e.g. <em>bewitch monster</em>). A giant reduced to 0 hp is left unconscious and possibly slain.</p>\n<h3>Humanoid</h3>\n<p>Humanoids are a type of monster that includes bugbears, centaurs, dwarves, elves, faeries, gnolls, gnomes, goblins, grimlocks, hobgoblins, hobgholls, kobolds, lizardmen, men, morlocks, neanderthals, nymphs, ogres, orcs, thrassians, tritons, troglodytes, and other creatures no larger than an ogre. Humanoids (other than humans) with character classes are called demi-humans. Humanoids who advance in class level do not cease to be humanoids even if they achieve 5 HD or more. All humanoids can be affected by <em>bewitch humanoid</em>and similar enchantments that target humanoids. A humanoid reduced to 0 hp is left unconscious and possibly slain.</p>\n<h3>Incarnation</h3>\n<p>Incarnations are manifestations of metaphysical powers from other sphere of existence. Incarnations can be kept at bay by <em>holy circle</em>and destroyed or driven off by <em>dispel evil</em><strong>.</strong> Incarnations include báleygr, cacodemons, chaos hulks, children of Nasga, elementals, genies, herald angels, manes, invisible stalkers, rakshasa, salamanders, and shadows. Incarnations of Chaotic alignment are inherently evil for purposes of <em>discern evil</em>and <em>holy circle</em>spells; the converse is true for Lawful incarnations. Most, but not all, incarnations can be affected by spells that can target living creatures (e.g. <em>bewitch monster</em>). All incarnations are immune to poisonous damage. Most are usually immune to either luminous or necrotic damage as well. An incarnation reduced to 0 hp is destroyed. Destruction triggers a dissipation of the incarnation’s soul, annihilating its individual existence. Only a <em>wish</em> or <em>miracle</em> can restore a destroyed incarnation to existence.</p>\n<h3>Monstrosity</h3>\n<p>Monstrosities are a type of monster characterized by supernatural abilities, impossible combinations of body parts, or both, including amphisbaenas, arane, attercop, barghests, basilisks, cairn dwellers, catoblepas, chimeras, dakhanavar, devil boars, doppelgangers, dragons, dragon turtles, faravahar, giant vampire bats, gorgons, griffons, hags, harpies, hellhawks, hellhounds, hippogriffs, hydra, khepri, lamias, lammasu, leyak, lycanthropes, manticore, medusas, minotaurs, owlbeasts, pegasi, phoenixes, rocs, rust beasts, sea serpents, sirens, skittering maws, spell tyrants, sphinxes, strix, stymphs, unicorns, wargs, wyverns, yali, and similar monsters. Some monstrosities are noted as bestial. A bestial monstrosity has animal-like intelligence. All other monstrosities are sapient and possess human or even super-human intelligence. Regardless of intelligence, monstrosities cannot be affected by enchantments that target humanoids (e.g. <em>bewitch humanoid</em>) but can be affected by enchantments that target living creatures in general (e.g. <em>bewitch monster</em>). A monstrosity reduced to 0 hp is left unconscious and possibly slain.</p>\n<h3>Ooze</h3>\n<p>Oozes are a type of mindless monster that include black blobs, gelatinous masses, grey goo, mustard molds, ochre oozes, and sage slimes. Oozes have a variety of different immunities and vulnerabilities, but all are immune to enchantment effects. An ooze reduced to 0 hp is slain.</p>\n<h3>Plant</h3>\n<p>Plants are a type of monsters that includes galdrtré, treeherders, and other sentient plants. All plants are immune to necrotic damage and poisonous damage. They can be dominated with <em>dominate plants</em> and spoken with via <em>speak with plants</em>. A plant reduced to 0 hp is slain.</p>\n<h3>Undead</h3>\n<p>Undead are a type of monster that include blood hounds, death chargers, draugr, flay fiends, haugbui, hoarflesh, mummies, mummy lords, nathaghol, necropedes, sepulchral worms, specters, skeletal slayers, skeletons, wights, wild huntsmen, wraiths, vampires, and zombies. These beings may have been alive at one time, but through foul magic or by dying at the hands of another undead type, have risen again as undead horrors. All undead are immune to enchantment effects, necrotic damage, and poisonous damage. All undead are inherently evil for purposes of <em>discern evil</em>and <em>holy circle</em>spells. An undead reduced to 0 hp is destroyed. If the undead was a construct, this destroys the magic animating the body. If the undead was not a construct, destruction triggers the previously-delayed dissipation of the undead’s soul, annihilating its individual existence. Only a <em>wish</em> or <em>miracle</em> can restore a destroyed undead to existence.</p>\n<h3>Vermin</h3>\n<p>Vermin are a type of monster that includes cavern locusts, carrion horrors, giant acanthaspis, giant ants, giant beetles, giant crabs, giant centipedes, giant killer bees, giant leeches, giant parasitic wasps, giant scorpions, giant spiders, giant ticks, giant worms, great ice worms, insect swarms, murder maggots, and other lower life forms. Vermin have such alien physiology and psychology that they cannot be affected by spells that affect animals. They can be affected by spells that target living creatures (e.g. <em>bewitch monster</em>). A vermin reduced to 0 hp is left unconscious and possibly slain.</p>\n",
