  "html": "<h2>Pastoralist Economics</h2>\n<p>Calculating revenue from livestock is complicated by the fact that livestock are born, reproduce, and die. To address this dynamic, we developed the concept of an <strong>equilibrium herd</strong>. The equilibrium herd is a set of animals of sufficient size to maintain its numbers year over year while producing milk, meat, wool, and other goods at a stable level. By using an equilibrium herd, average revenue per animal can be calculated as the revenue produced by the equilibrium herd divided by the number of animals in the herd. Using an equilibrium also enables us to assess the return on investment in livestock.</p>\n<p>Child-aged livestock have been priced at 50% of adult price, while adolescent livestock are at full price. Baby, child, and adolescent livestock have pelts and meat worth 25%, 50%, and 75% of the value of adult livestock, but adolescent males are treated as adult females due to dimorphism. Pasture is priced at 15gp per acre.</p>\n<h3>Cattle Herds</h3>\n<p>An equilibrium herd consists of 16 cattle, including 8 adult cows, 2 heifers (adolescent female cows), 2 bullocks (adolescent male cows), 2 bull calves (child male cows), and 2 cow calves (child female cows). The adult cows have access to a bull (not included in the herd). Every year, the following occurs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Each head of cattle receives 5 days of labor costing 1sp per day, for a total of (16 x 5 x .1) 8gp.</li>\n<li>Each of the 16 heads of cattle grazes on 1.33 acres of pasture, for a total of 21.28 acres.</li>\n<li>Each of the 8 milk-cows has a 70% annual chance of giving birth to a calf, which has a 70% chance of surviving to mid-year. Therefore there are (8 x .7 x .7) 4 calves by mid-year, of which 2 are bull calves and 2 are cow calves.</li>\n<li>6 of the milk cows produce 125 gallons of milk each. The 2 oldest milk cows and the 2 heifers produce 112.5 gallons of milk each. Total milk production is [(6 x 125) + (4 x 112.5)] 1,200 gallons. Milk is worth 1sp per gallon, so the herd produces 120gp worth of milk.</li>\n<li>The 2 oldest milk cows and the 2 bullocks are slaughtered for beef and leather. Each produces 250lbs of beef valued at 4cp per pound, or 10gp, for 40gp worth of meat total. Each produces 25lbs of leather valued at 6.6cp per pound, or 1.65gp, for 6.6gp worth of leather total.</li>\n<li>The 2 heifers develop into milk-cows.</li>\n<li>The 2 bull calves develops into bullocks.</li>\n<li>The 2 cow calves develop into heifers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At year’s end, the herd has returned to its equilibrium of 8 milk-cows, 2 heifers, 2 bullocks, 2 bull calves, and 2 cow calves. Total production is (120gp + 40gp +6.6) 166.6gp and total cost is 8gp, for profit of 158.6gp. On average, revenue per head of cattle is (166.6/16) 10.41gp and labor cost is (8/16) 0.5gp.</p>\n<h6>Return on Investment</h6>\n<p>Purchasing 8 milk-cows, 2 heifers, 2 bull calves, and 2 cow calves costs [(8 x 10) + (2 x 10) + (2 x 5) + (2 x 5) ] 120gp. Pasture can be purchased at 15gp per acre, so purchasing 21.28 acres of pasture costs 319.2gp. Total investment is therefore 439.2gp, rounded to 440gp. According to <em><strong>ACKS</strong></em>secret ratio, that should yield 13.33gp per month or 160gp per year profit. At 158.6gp per year, cattle herding yields 99% of the value predicted by the secret ratio. It’s much more profitable than mixed farming.</p>\n<h6>Caloric Return on Acreage</h6>\n<p>A gallon of cow milk has 2,400 calories and a pound of beef has 1,000 calories. Caloric production is therefore (1,200 x 2,400) 2,880,000 calories of milk and (250 x 4 x 1000) 1,000,000 calories of beef, or 3,880,000 calories. This takes 21.28 acres of pasture. In contrast, 21.28 acres of farmland will produce 21.28 quarters of wheat with 576,000 calories per quarter. Therefore a similar acreage of wheat farmland will produce (21.28 quarters x 8 bushel/quarter x 72 loaves/bushel x 1000 calories/loaf) 12,257,280 calories. Raising cattle is only about 30% as efficient in producing calories as wheat farming. A civilization can get rich on cattle farming, but can’t feed itself.</p>\n<h6>Terrain</h6>\n<p>Cattle can only be reared in Clear, Grass, Scrub, Woods, and Hills terrain. They cannot be reared in Barrens, Desert, Mountains, Swamp, or Jungle terrain.</p>\n<h6>Mixed Grazing</h6>\n<p>For each cattle grazed on a farm, one goat or sheep may be grazed in the same acreage. Each species eats the grasses, shrubs, and bushes it prefers, increasing the efficiency of the pasturage.</p>\n<h3>Goat Flocks</h3>\n<p>An equilibrium flock consists of 16 goats, including 8 doe, 2 yearling doe, 2 yearling bucks, 2 doe kids, and 2 buck kids. All the does have access to an uncastrated buck. Every year, the following occurs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Each goat requires 5 days of labor costing 1sp per day, for a total of (16 x 5 x .1) 8gp.</li>\n<li>Each of the 16 goat requires 0.167 acres of pasture to graze on, for a total of 2.67 acres.</li>\n<li>Each of the 8 doe has a 70% annual chance of giving birth to a kid, which has a 70% chance of surviving to mid-year. Therefore there are (8 x .7 x .7) 4 kids born, of which 2 are doe kids and 2 are buck kids.</li>\n<li>Each of the 16 goats produces 0.5lbs of fleece worth 5sp per lbs, or 2.5sp per fleece, for a total of (16 x .25) 4gp.</li>\n<li>6 of the doe produce 22.5 gallons of milk each. The 2 oldest doe and the 2 yearling doe produce 20 gallons of milk each. Total milk production is [(6 x 22.5) + (4 x 20)] 215 gallons. Milk is worth 1sp per gallon, so the herd produces 21.5gp worth of milk.</li>\n<li>The 2 oldest does and the 2 yearling bucks are slaughtered for chevon and leather. Each produces 33lbs of chevon valued at 3cp per pound, or 1gp, for 4gp worth of meat total. Each produces 3.3lbs of leather valued at 6.6cp per pound, or 0.22gp, for 0.88gp worth of leather total.</li>\n<li>The 2 yearling does develop into does.</li>\n<li>The 2 buck kids develops into yearling bucks.</li>\n<li>The 2 doe kids develop into yearling doe.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At year’s end, the flock has returned to its equilibrium of 8 doe, 2 yearling doe, 2 yearling bucks, 2 doe kids, and 2 buck kids. Total production is (4 + 21.5 + 4 + 0.88) 30.3gp and total cost is 8gp, for profit of 22.38gp. On average, revenue per goat is (30.38/16) 1.90gp and labor cost is (8/16) 0.5gp.</p>\n<h6>Return on Investment</h6>\n<p>Purchasing 8 doe, 2 yearling doe, 2 doe kids, and 2 buck kids cost costs [ (8 x 2) + (2 x 2) + (2 x 1) + (2 x 1) ] 24gp. Pasture can be purchased at 15gp per acre, so purchasing 2.67 acres of pasture costs 40gp. Total investment is therefore (24 + 40) 64gp. According to the <em><strong>ACKS</strong></em>secret ratio, that should yield 1.93gp per month or 23.27gp per year profit. At 22.38gp per year, goat herding yields 96% of the value predicted by the secret ratio. Goats have a lower return than sheep or cattle, but a higher return than pigs or mixed farming.</p>\n<h6>Caloric Return on Acreage</h6>\n<p>A gallon of goat’s milk has 2,250 calories and a pound of chevon has 650 calories. Caloric production is therefore (215 x 2,250) 483,750 calories of milk and (4 x 33 x 650) 85,800 calories of chevon, or 569,550 calories, over 2.67 acres. In contrast, 2.67 acres of farmland will (2.67 quarters x 8 bushel/quarter x 72 loaves/bushel x 1000 calories/loaf) 1,537,920 calories, or 2.7 times as much. Raising goats is only 37% as efficient in producing calories as farming. They are less calorically efficient than pigs but more calorically efficient than cattle or sheep.</p>\n<h6>Terrain</h6>\n<p>Goats can be reared in Clear, Grass, Scrub, Woods, Mountains, Hills, or Barrens terrain. They cannot be reared in Swamp, Jungle, or Desert terrain. The ability to be reared in Mountains and Barrens terrain makes them economically competitive for peasants living outside of the most fertile lands.</p>\n<h6>Mixed Grazing</h6>\n<p>For each cattle grazed on a farm, one goat or sheep may be grazed in the same acreage. Each species eats the grasses, shrubs, and bushes it prefers, increasing the efficiency of the pasturage.</p>\n<h3>Sheep Flocks</h3>\n<p>An equilibrium flock consists of 16 sheep, including 8 ewes, 2 yearling ewes, 2 yearling rams, 2 ewe lambs, and 2 ram lambs. All the ewes have access to an uncastrated ram. Every year, the following occurs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Each sheep requires 1.33 days of labor costing 1sp per day, for a total of (16 x 1.33 x .1) 2.13gp.</li>\n<li>Each of the 16 sheep requires 0.167 acres of pasture to graze on, for a total of 2.67 acres.</li>\n<li>Each of the 8 ewes has a 70% annual chance of giving birth to a lamb, which has a 70% chance of surviving to mid-year. Therefore there are (8 x .7 x .7) 4 lambs born, of which 2 are ewe lambs and 2 are ram lambs.</li>\n<li>Each of the 16 sheep produces an average of 1.5lbs of fleece, worth 5sp per lb, or 7.5sp per fleece, for a total of (16 x .75) 12gp.</li>\n<li>6 of the ewes produce 9 gallons of milk each. The 2 oldest ewes and the 2 yearling ewes produce 8 gallons of milk each. Total milk production is [(6 x 9) + (4 x 8)] 86 gallons. Milk is worth 1sp per gallon, so the herd produces 8.6gp worth of milk.</li>\n<li>The 2 oldest ewes and the 2 yearling rams are slaughtered for mutton and leather. Each produces 25lbs of mutton valued at 4cp per pound, or 1gp, for 4gp worth of meat total. Each produces 2.5lbs of leather valued at 6.6cp per pound, or 0.165gp, for 0.67cp worth of leather total.</li>\n<li>The 2 yearling ewes develop into ewes.</li>\n<li>The 2 ram lambs develops into yearling rams.</li>\n<li>The 2 ewe lambs develop into yearling ewes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At year’s end, the flock has returned to its equilibrium of 8 ewes, 2 yearling ewes, 2 yearling rams, 2 ewe lambs, and 2 ram lambs. Total production is (12 + 8.6 + 4 +0.67) 25.3gp and total cost is 2.13gp, for profit of 23.17gp. On average, revenue per sheep is (25.2 / 16) 1.58gp and labor cost is (2.13/16) 0.13gp.</p>\n<h6>Return on Investment</h6>\n<p>Purchasing 8 ewes, 2 yearling ewes, 2 ewe lambs, and 2 ram lambs cost costs [ (8 x 2) + (2 x 2) + (2 x 1) + (2 x 1) ] 24gp. Pasture can be purchased at 15gp per acre, so purchasing 2.67 acres of pasture costs 40gp. Total investment is therefore 64gp. According to the <em><strong>ACKS</strong></em>secret ratio, that should yield 1.93gp per month or 23.16gp per year profit. At 23.17gp per year, sheep herding yields 100% of the value predicted by the secret ratio. Sheep have the highest return on investment of any livestock.</p>\n<p>However, over 45% of a sheep’s revenue is derived from its wool. Annual consumption of wool was historically around one pound per person in pre-modern times. Since each sheep produces more than a pound of wool annually, a farmer with more than a half-dozen sheep must be producing wool for sale. Sheep herding will therefore only truly realize its value when a well-developed wool export market exists. Moreover, sheep herding is quite inefficient as a means of producing calories. Therefore, even if an export market exists, land must be widely available relative to the size of the populace in order for enough to be available as pasture for sheep. The most well-known historical confluence of these requirements is England in the centuries after the Black Death.</p>\n<h6>Caloric Return on Acreage</h6>\n<p>A gallon of sheep’s milk has 2,400 calories and a pound of mutton has 1,000 calories. Caloric production is therefore (86 x 2,400) 206,400 calories of milk and (4 x 25 x 1,000) 100,000 calories of mutton, or 306,400 calories. This takes 2.67 acres of pasture. In contrast, 2.67 acres of farmland will produce (2.67 quarters x 8 bushel/quarter x 72 loaves/bushel x 1000 calories/loaf) 1,537,920 calories, or 5 times as much. Raising sheep is only 20% as efficient in producing calories as farming.</p>\n<h6>Terrain</h6>\n<p>Sheep can be reared in Clear, Grass, Scrub, Woods, Mountains, and Hills terrain. They cannot be reared in Swamp, Barren, Desert, or Jungle terrain.</p>\n<h6>Mixed Grazing</h6>\n<p>For each cattle grazed on a farm, one goat or sheep may be grazed in the same acreage. Each species eats the grasses, shrubs, and bushes it prefers, increasing the efficiency of the pasturage.</p>\n<h3>Swine Herds</h3>\n<p>An equilibrium herd consists of 11 swine, including 1 sow, 5 pigs, and 5 piglets. The sow has access to a boar. Every year, the following occurs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Each swine requires 3 days of labor costing 1sp per day, for a total of (11 x 3 x .1) 3.3gp.</li>\n<li>Each swine requires 0.1 acres of pasture to graze on, for a total of 1.1 acres.</li>\n<li>The sow gives birth to a litter of 6 piglets, of which 5 survive to mid-year.</li>\n<li>The 5 pigs are slaughtered for pork. Each produces 83lbs of pork valued at 3cp per pound, or 2.5gp, for 12.5gp worth of meat total.</li>\n<li>The 5 piglets develop into pigs.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Total production is 12.5gp worth of meat and total cost is 3.3gp, for a profit of 9.2gp. On average, revenue per pig is (12.5/11) 1.14gp and labor cost is (3.3/11) 0.3gp.</p>\n<h6>Return on Investment</h6>\n<p>Purchasing a sow and 5 piglets costs [3 + (5 x 1.5) ] 10.5gp. Pasture can be purchased at 15gp per acre, so purchasing 1.1 acres costs 16.5gp. Total investment is therefore 27gp. According to the <em><strong>ACKS</strong></em>secret ratio, that should yield 0.82gp per month or 9.82gp per year profit. At 9.2gp per year, swine herding yields 94% of the value predicted by the secret ratio. Swine have the lowest return on investment of any livestock.</p>\n<h6>Caloric Return on Acreage</h6>\n<p>A pound of pork has 650 calories. Caloric production is therefore (5 x 83 x 650) 269,750 calories over 1.1 acres. 1.1 acres of farmland will produce 1.1 quarters of wheat, yielding (1.1 quarters x 8 bushels/quarter x 72 loaves/bushel x 1000 calories/loaf) 633,600 calories, or 2.34 times as much. Raising swine is 42% as efficient in producing calories as farming. Swine are thus the most calorically-efficient livestock. Since a single pig requires no acreage, the easiest way for peasants to introduce meat into their diet is by pig farming.</p>\n<h6>Terrain</h6>\n<p>Swine can be reared in Clear, Grass, Scrub, Woods, Hills, Swamp, and Jungle terrain. They cannot be reared in Mountain, Barren, or Desert terrain.</p>\n<h6>Pannage</h6>\n<p>To represent the practice of allowing peasant-owned swine to feed on fallen acorns and nuts in nearby woodlands, each peasant family can rear a single swine without allocating acreage per family.</p>\n<p><strong>Historical Note:</strong> Historically, meat has been estimated at 5 to 6 1/2 times as expensive as wheat on a caloric basis. Since a 1,000-calorie loaf of bread costs 0.69cp, we should expect a 1,000-calorie serving of meat to cost 3.45cp to 4.49cp. Mutton and beef have about 1,000 calories per pound, so they should cost about 3.45cp to 4.49cp per pound. Chevon and pork have about 650 calories per pound, so they should cost 2.25cp to 2.93cp per pound. In these rules, we assume that beef and mutton costs 4cp per pound, chevon and pork costs 3cp per pound, and other meat costs 2cp per pound.</p>\n",

  "rawMarkdown": "## Pastoralist Economics\n\nCalculating revenue from livestock is complicated by the fact that livestock are born, reproduce, and die. To address this dynamic, we developed the concept of an **equilibrium herd**. The equilibrium herd is a set of animals of sufficient size to maintain its numbers year over year while producing milk, meat, wool, and other goods at a stable level. By using an equilibrium herd, average revenue per animal can be calculated as the revenue produced by the equilibrium herd divided by the number of animals in the herd. Using an equilibrium also enables us to assess the return on investment in livestock.\n\nChild-aged livestock have been priced at 50% of adult price, while adolescent livestock are at full price. Baby, child, and adolescent livestock have pelts and meat worth 25%, 50%, and 75% of the value of adult livestock, but adolescent males are treated as adult females due to dimorphism. Pasture is priced at 15gp per acre.\n\n### Cattle Herds\n\nAn equilibrium herd consists of 16 cattle, including 8 adult cows, 2 heifers (adolescent female cows), 2 bullocks (adolescent male cows), 2 bull calves (child male cows), and 2 cow calves (child female cows). The adult cows have access to a bull (not included in the herd). Every year, the following occurs:\n\n* Each head of cattle receives 5 days of labor costing 1sp per day, for a total of (16 x 5 x .1) 8gp.\n* Each of the 16 heads of cattle grazes on 1.33 acres of pasture, for a total of 21.28 acres.\n* Each of the 8 milk-cows has a 70% annual chance of giving birth to a calf, which has a 70% chance of surviving to mid-year. Therefore there are (8 x .7 x .7) 4 calves by mid-year, of which 2 are bull calves and 2 are cow calves.\n* 6 of the milk cows produce 125 gallons of milk each. The 2 oldest milk cows and the 2 heifers produce 112.5 gallons of milk each. Total milk production is [(6 x 125) + (4 x 112.5)] 1,200 gallons. Milk is worth 1sp per gallon, so the herd produces 120gp worth of milk.\n* The 2 oldest milk cows and the 2 bullocks are slaughtered for beef and leather. Each produces 250lbs of beef valued at 4cp per pound, or 10gp, for 40gp worth of meat total. Each produces 25lbs of leather valued at 6.6cp per pound, or 1.65gp, for 6.6gp worth of leather total.\n* The 2 heifers develop into milk-cows.\n* The 2 bull calves develops into bullocks.\n* The 2 cow calves develop into heifers.\n\nAt year’s end, the herd has returned to its equilibrium of 8 milk-cows, 2 heifers, 2 bullocks, 2 bull calves, and 2 cow calves. Total production is (120gp + 40gp +6.6) 166.6gp and total cost is 8gp, for profit of 158.6gp. On average, revenue per head of cattle is (166.6/16) 10.41gp and labor cost is (8/16) 0.5gp.\n\n###### Return on Investment\n\nPurchasing 8 milk-cows, 2 heifers, 2 bull calves, and 2 cow calves costs [(8 x 10) + (2 x 10) + (2 x 5) + (2 x 5) ] 120gp. Pasture can be purchased at 15gp per acre, so purchasing 21.28 acres of pasture costs 319.2gp. Total investment is therefore 439.2gp, rounded to 440gp. According to ***ACKS***secret ratio, that should yield 13.33gp per month or 160gp per year profit. At 158.6gp per year, cattle herding yields 99% of the value predicted by the secret ratio. It’s much more profitable than mixed farming.\n\n###### Caloric Return on Acreage\n\nA gallon of cow milk has 2,400 calories and a pound of beef has 1,000 calories. Caloric production is therefore (1,200 x 2,400) 2,880,000 calories of milk and (250 x 4 x 1000) 1,000,000 calories of beef, or 3,880,000 calories. This takes 21.28 acres of pasture. In contrast, 21.28 acres of farmland will produce 21.28 quarters of wheat with 576,000 calories per quarter. Therefore a similar acreage of wheat farmland will produce (21.28 quarters x 8 bushel/quarter x 72 loaves/bushel x 1000 calories/loaf) 12,257,280 calories. Raising cattle is only about 30% as efficient in producing calories as wheat farming. A civilization can get rich on cattle farming, but can’t feed itself.\n\n###### Terrain\n\nCattle can only be reared in Clear, Grass, Scrub, Woods, and Hills terrain. They cannot be reared in Barrens, Desert, Mountains, Swamp, or Jungle terrain.\n\n###### Mixed Grazing\n\nFor each cattle grazed on a farm, one goat or sheep may be grazed in the same acreage. Each species eats the grasses, shrubs, and bushes it prefers, increasing the efficiency of the pasturage.\n\n### Goat Flocks\n\nAn equilibrium flock consists of 16 goats, including 8 doe, 2 yearling doe, 2 yearling bucks, 2 doe kids, and 2 buck kids. All the does have access to an uncastrated buck. Every year, the following occurs:\n\n* Each goat requires 5 days of labor costing 1sp per day, for a total of (16 x 5 x .1) 8gp.\n* Each of the 16 goat requires 0.167 acres of pasture to graze on, for a total of 2.67 acres.\n* Each of the 8 doe has a 70% annual chance of giving birth to a kid, which has a 70% chance of surviving to mid-year. Therefore there are (8 x .7 x .7) 4 kids born, of which 2 are doe kids and 2 are buck kids.\n* Each of the 16 goats produces 0.5lbs of fleece worth 5sp per lbs, or 2.5sp per fleece, for a total of (16 x .25) 4gp.\n* 6 of the doe produce 22.5 gallons of milk each. The 2 oldest doe and the 2 yearling doe produce 20 gallons of milk each. Total milk production is [(6 x 22.5) + (4 x 20)] 215 gallons. Milk is worth 1sp per gallon, so the herd produces 21.5gp worth of milk.\n* The 2 oldest does and the 2 yearling bucks are slaughtered for chevon and leather. Each produces 33lbs of chevon valued at 3cp per pound, or 1gp, for 4gp worth of meat total. Each produces 3.3lbs of leather valued at 6.6cp per pound, or 0.22gp, for 0.88gp worth of leather total.\n* The 2 yearling does develop into does.\n* The 2 buck kids develops into yearling bucks.\n* The 2 doe kids develop into yearling doe.\n\nAt year’s end, the flock has returned to its equilibrium of 8 doe, 2 yearling doe, 2 yearling bucks, 2 doe kids, and 2 buck kids. Total production is (4 + 21.5 + 4 + 0.88) 30.3gp and total cost is 8gp, for profit of 22.38gp. On average, revenue per goat is (30.38/16) 1.90gp and labor cost is (8/16) 0.5gp.\n\n###### Return on Investment\n\nPurchasing 8 doe, 2 yearling doe, 2 doe kids, and 2 buck kids cost costs [ (8 x 2) + (2 x 2) + (2 x 1) + (2 x 1) ] 24gp. Pasture can be purchased at 15gp per acre, so purchasing 2.67 acres of pasture costs 40gp. Total investment is therefore (24 + 40) 64gp. According to the ***ACKS***secret ratio, that should yield 1.93gp per month or 23.27gp per year profit. At 22.38gp per year, goat herding yields 96% of the value predicted by the secret ratio. Goats have a lower return than sheep or cattle, but a higher return than pigs or mixed farming.\n\n###### Caloric Return on Acreage\n\nA gallon of goat’s milk has 2,250 calories and a pound of chevon has 650 calories. Caloric production is therefore (215 x 2,250) 483,750 calories of milk and (4 x 33 x 650) 85,800 calories of chevon, or 569,550 calories, over 2.67 acres. In contrast, 2.67 acres of farmland will (2.67 quarters x 8 bushel/quarter x 72 loaves/bushel x 1000 calories/loaf) 1,537,920 calories, or 2.7 times as much. Raising goats is only 37% as efficient in producing calories as farming. They are less calorically efficient than pigs but more calorically efficient than cattle or sheep.\n\n###### Terrain\n\nGoats can be reared in Clear, Grass, Scrub, Woods, Mountains, Hills, or Barrens terrain. They cannot be reared in Swamp, Jungle, or Desert terrain. The ability to be reared in Mountains and Barrens terrain makes them economically competitive for peasants living outside of the most fertile lands.\n\n###### Mixed Grazing\n\nFor each cattle grazed on a farm, one goat or sheep may be grazed in the same acreage. Each species eats the grasses, shrubs, and bushes it prefers, increasing the efficiency of the pasturage.\n\n### Sheep Flocks\n\nAn equilibrium flock consists of 16 sheep, including 8 ewes, 2 yearling ewes, 2 yearling rams, 2 ewe lambs, and 2 ram lambs. All the ewes have access to an uncastrated ram. Every year, the following occurs:\n\n* Each sheep requires 1.33 days of labor costing 1sp per day, for a total of (16 x 1.33 x .1) 2.13gp.\n* Each of the 16 sheep requires 0.167 acres of pasture to graze on, for a total of 2.67 acres.\n* Each of the 8 ewes has a 70% annual chance of giving birth to a lamb, which has a 70% chance of surviving to mid-year. Therefore there are (8 x .7 x .7) 4 lambs born, of which 2 are ewe lambs and 2 are ram lambs.\n* Each of the 16 sheep produces an average of 1.5lbs of fleece, worth 5sp per lb, or 7.5sp per fleece, for a total of (16 x .75) 12gp.\n* 6 of the ewes produce 9 gallons of milk each. The 2 oldest ewes and the 2 yearling ewes produce 8 gallons of milk each. Total milk production is [(6 x 9) + (4 x 8)] 86 gallons. Milk is worth 1sp per gallon, so the herd produces 8.6gp worth of milk.\n* The 2 oldest ewes and the 2 yearling rams are slaughtered for mutton and leather. Each produces 25lbs of mutton valued at 4cp per pound, or 1gp, for 4gp worth of meat total. Each produces 2.5lbs of leather valued at 6.6cp per pound, or 0.165gp, for 0.67cp worth of leather total.\n* The 2 yearling ewes develop into ewes.\n* The 2 ram lambs develops into yearling rams.\n* The 2 ewe lambs develop into yearling ewes.\n\nAt year’s end, the flock has returned to its equilibrium of 8 ewes, 2 yearling ewes, 2 yearling rams, 2 ewe lambs, and 2 ram lambs. Total production is (12 + 8.6 + 4 +0.67) 25.3gp and total cost is 2.13gp, for profit of 23.17gp. On average, revenue per sheep is (25.2 / 16) 1.58gp and labor cost is (2.13/16) 0.13gp.\n\n###### Return on Investment\n\nPurchasing 8 ewes, 2 yearling ewes, 2 ewe lambs, and 2 ram lambs cost costs [ (8 x 2) + (2 x 2) + (2 x 1) + (2 x 1) ] 24gp. Pasture can be purchased at 15gp per acre, so purchasing 2.67 acres of pasture costs 40gp. Total investment is therefore 64gp. According to the ***ACKS***secret ratio, that should yield 1.93gp per month or 23.16gp per year profit. At 23.17gp per year, sheep herding yields 100% of the value predicted by the secret ratio. Sheep have the highest return on investment of any livestock.\n\nHowever, over 45% of a sheep’s revenue is derived from its wool. Annual consumption of wool was historically around one pound per person in pre-modern times. Since each sheep produces more than a pound of wool annually, a farmer with more than a half-dozen sheep must be producing wool for sale.

Therefore, even if an export market exists, land must be widely available relative to the size of the populace in order for enough to be available as pasture for sheep. The most well-known historical confluence of these requirements is England in the centuries after the Black Death.\n\n###### Caloric Return on Acreage\n\nA gallon of sheep’s milk has 2,400 calories and a pound of mutton has 1,000 calories. Caloric production is therefore (86 x 2,400) 206,400 calories of milk and (4 x 25 x 1,000) 100,000 calories of mutton, or 306,400 calories. This takes 2.67 acres of pasture. In contrast, 2.67 acres of farmland will produce (2.67 quarters x 8 bushel/quarter x 72 loaves/bushel x 1000 calories/loaf) 1,537,920 calories, or 5 times as much. Raising sheep is only 20% as efficient in producing calories as farming.\n\n###### Terrain\n\nSheep can be reared in Clear, Grass, Scrub, Woods, Mountains, and Hills terrain. They cannot be reared in Swamp, Barren, Desert, or Jungle terrain.\n\n###### Mixed Grazing\n\nFor each cattle grazed on a farm, one goat or sheep may be grazed in the same acreage. Each species eats the grasses, shrubs, and bushes it prefers, increasing the efficiency of the pasturage.\n\n### Swine Herds\n\nAn equilibrium herd consists of 11 swine, including 1 sow, 5 pigs, and 5 piglets. The sow has access to a boar. Every year, the following occurs:\n\n* Each swine requires 3 days of labor costing 1sp per day, for a total of (11 x 3 x .1) 3.3gp.\n* Each swine requires 0.1 acres of pasture to graze on, for a total of 1.1 acres.\n* The sow gives birth to a litter of 6 piglets, of which 5 survive to mid-year.\n* The 5 pigs are slaughtered for pork. Each produces 83lbs of pork valued at 3cp per pound, or 2.5gp, for 12.5gp worth of meat total.\n* The 5 piglets develop into pigs.\n\nTotal production is 12.5gp worth of meat and total cost is 3.3gp, for a profit of 9.2gp. On average, revenue per pig is (12.5/11) 1.14gp and labor cost is (3.3/11) 0.3gp.\n\n###### Return on Investment\n\nPurchasing a sow and 5 piglets costs [3 + (5 x 1.5) ] 10.5gp. Pasture can be purchased at 15gp per acre, so purchasing 1.1 acres costs 16.5gp. Total investment is therefore 27gp. According to the ***ACKS***secret ratio, that should yield 0.82gp per month or 9.82gp per year profit. At 9.2gp per year, swine herding yields 94% of the value predicted by the secret ratio. Swine have the lowest return on investment of any livestock.\n\n###### Caloric Return on Acreage\n\nA pound of pork has 650 calories. Caloric production is therefore (5 x 83 x 650) 269,750 calories over 1.1 acres. 1.1 acres of farmland will produce 1.1 quarters of wheat, yielding (1.1 quarters x 8 bushels/quarter x 72 loaves/bushel x 1000 calories/loaf) 633,600 calories, or 2.34 times as much. Raising swine is 42% as efficient in producing calories as farming. Swine are thus the most calorically-efficient livestock.

They cannot be reared in Mountain, Barren, or Desert terrain.\n\n###### Pannage\n\nTo represent the practice of allowing peasant-owned swine to feed on fallen acorns and nuts in nearby woodlands, each peasant family can rear a single swine without allocating acreage per family.\n\n**Historical Note:** Historically, meat has been estimated at 5 to 6 1/2 times as expensive as wheat on a caloric basis. Since a 1,000-calorie loaf of bread costs 0.69cp, we should expect a 1,000-calorie serving of meat to cost 3.45cp to 4.49cp.
