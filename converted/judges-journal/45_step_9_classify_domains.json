P. XX of the <em><strong>ACKS II Revised Rulebook</strong></em>states that “Existing domains ... are classified by the Judge based on the geography, history, and politics of the region. Newly established domains are classified based on their proximity to urban settlements. A newly-established domain is classified as civilized if all of its territory is within 48 miles of a city or large town. A newly established domain is classified as borderlands if all of its territory is within 72 miles of a city or large town. All other newly established domains are classified as outlands.

Likewise, being within 72 miles of a city or large town always makes a domain at least borderlands, but it’s not the only way for a domain to be borderlands. Apart from those two conditions, it’s entirely up to you to decide which territory counts as civilized, borderlands, or outlands.

We classified Siadanos and Menicos as borderlands even though they are not within 72 miles of Cyfaraun. What was our justification? Siadanos was once a large elven city, and the region around it had long been purged of dangerous monsters. With the Auran takeover, it has lapsed from civilized into borderlands. Menicos, meanwhile, we decided was within 72 miles of an off-table city to the northeast. The Lusaun Forest, Viamir Marshes, and Viaspen Forest are all classified as unsettled wildlands despite being “within” the Principality because they are uninhabited and untamed lands.</p>\n<p><img src=\"data:image/png;base64...\" alt=\"\"></p>\n",
