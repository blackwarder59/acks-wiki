Worship was an act of propitiation, expressed in the formula <em>do ut des</em> (“I give that you might give”): The gods were expected to reward acts of worship with blessings, gifts, victories, and so on.</p>\n<p><em>Do ut des</em> is the basis for the mechanics of divine power detailed in the <em><strong>ACKS II</strong></em><em><strong>Revised Rulebook</strong></em>. While the rules discuss divine power in the context of divine magic, all magic is, in effect, an application of divine power. The difference between arcane and divine magic is that mages use their personal power to manipulate sources immanent within the world, while crusaders use their personal power to channel divine sources.</p>\n<h3>Divine Power of Creatures</h3>\n<p>The total amount of divine power possessed by a creature is equal to ten times its XP value. When a creature dies, about 90% of this value rapidly transmigrates; the other 10% remains as a residue within the creature’s blood or organs, which can be harvested as special components for magical research. When a creature is sacrificed, 80% of its divine power passes to the entity worshipped, 10% is retained by the sacrificier for his own ends, and 10% remains residual within its blood and organs. This why XP value = special component value = sacrifice value.</p>\n<p>A living creature will generate excess divine power each day equal to 6% of its XP value. Casters use caster level instead of HD for this determination and add one * for partial progression and ** for full progression. For example, a 14th level mage counts as a HD 14** creature (worth 3,800XP); he therefore has (3,800 x 6%) about 230 points of divine power available. Casters use some of this to fuel their spells (a 14th level mage’s spells cost about 190 divine power). The rest is dissipated or bequeathed to a god through worship. (As with sacrifice, a crusader that leads a congregant in worship collects 10% while the god collects the rest). Once expended, the creature’s divine power will recharge through food and drink.</p>\n<h3>The Cost of Spells</h3>\n<p>For Judges who, like Pythagoras, believe that numbers constitute the true nature of things, here are the actual costs in divine power to cast each level of spell in <em><strong>ACKS</strong></em>:</p>\n<p>1st: 1 / 5 4th: 10 / 50</p>\n<p>2nd: 3 / 15 5th: 15 / 75</p>\n<p>3rd: 6 / 30 6th: 21 / 105</p>\n<p>The number before the slash is how much of his own divine power the spellcaster must expend to channel the spell’s magic, while the number after the slash represents the total divine power consumed to fuel the spell, drawn from the caster’s god or from immanent sources in the environment. (If the spellcaster is himself a god using arcane or divine power to cast, he must pay full cost.) 7th – 9th level spells can only be cast by rituals with much higher costs.</p>\n<p>Note that spell point costs for spells (found in the <em><strong>Heroic Fantasy Handbook</strong></em>) are actually the cost in divine power divided by 2 and rounded off into a smooth progression. Hence 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, and 21 became 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 10.</p>\n<p>Creating magical items (including the components to cast ritual magic) requires additional divine power to transform the materials used into a form which can hold and sustain the magic. This extra divine power is sourced from special components, sacrifice, etc.</p>\n<h3>Divine Power of the Gods</h3>\n<p>How much divine power do the gods have access to? Gods gain divine power from two sources, sacrifice and worship.</p>\n<p>From the <em><strong>ACKS II Revised Rulebook</strong></em><em>,</em> we know that sacrificing a peasant worth 5 XP to a god will yield 5 points of divine power to the sacrificier. Since the sacrificier gets 10% and the god gets 80%, the sacrifice must get 40 points to the god. Sacrificing 50 peasants will yield 2,000 points of divine power.</p>\n<p>That same peasant, if kept alive, will produce a surplus of (5 XP x 0.06 DP/XP) = 3 divine power per day or 21 divine power per week. 50 such peasants will produce 110 divine power per week. If the peasants were utterly faithful, 90% of this would go to their god and 10% would go to the divine spellcaster who organized their congregation. That’s 99 for the god and 11 for the caster. That tracks with the <em><strong>ACKS II</strong></em><em><strong>Revised Rulebook</strong></em>, where every fifty congregants earns the caster 10gp worth of divine power per week of faithful worship.</p>\n<p>Of course, most divine casters don’t have that many utterly faithful congregants. Most are ministering to domains filled with somewhat-faithful peasants who yield the caster about 4 points of divine power per week. That means the caster’s god is getting 36 points of divine power per week from those 50 men (or about 0.7 points per worshipper).</p>\n<p>Given its global population of about 150 million normal men, the world of Cybele yields around 108 million points of divine power per week. There are around 2.7 million crusaders in Cybele; fueling their spells costs about 80 million divine power per week. That leaves the gods with about 25% of their power available for other purposes.</p>\n<h3>Apotheosis</h3>\n<p>How much divine power would a mortal have to accumulate to achieve godhood? For a deceased creature to maintain its soul requires excess divine power each day equal to 6% of its XP value or caster level (whichever is greater). Thus the 14th level mage whose body has died now requires 230 divine power per day just to sustain himself, which works out to 1,610 divine power per week. At 0.7 divine power per worshipper per week, the apotheosizing character will need 2,300 worshippers to sustain himself.</p>\n<p>What if the would-be god also wants to have divine magic? It costs 800 divine power to fuel a 14th level crusader for a single day, 5,600 to fuel him for a week. This would require about (800 divine power / 0.7 divine power per worshipper) 11,420 worshippers. It is thus conceivable that a deified priest-king of a city-state who persuaded his subjects to worship him could cast divine magic powered by his own worship.</p>\n<p>That priest-king is not really a god, of course, merely a crusader of his own faith. To be a powerful polytheistic god, for example one that could cast 6th level spellsevery round, how many worshippers would be required? Being able to cast a 6th level spellevery round for a week would cost (126 divine power x 60 rounds/hour x 24 hours/day x 7 days/week) 1,270,080 divine power per week. That would require (1,270,080 / 0.7) 1,814,400 worshippers. That is not inconceivable for a powerful god-emperor, but he who dares to try will face challenges from the existing gods and clerics of the world.</p>\n<p>To be a nigh-almighty being that could cast <em>wish</em> every round would require much more: 200,000 divine power x 60 rounds/hour x 24 hours/day x 7 days/week) = 2,016,000,000 divine power per week. That would require 2.88 billion worshippers, far more than the population of Cybele. None of the gods of Cybele are omnipotent.</p>\n",
