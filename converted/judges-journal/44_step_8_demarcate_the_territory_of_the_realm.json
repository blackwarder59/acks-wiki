This step, and all subsequent steps, are optional at this point. They will not matter much to your campaign until your players have advanced in several levels of experience.

That said, at some point the player characters will advance into conqueror-tier play and you’ll want to be ready for that by knowing who rules what.</p>\n<h3>A. Demarcate the Territory of the Prince’s Personal Domain</h3>\n<p>Earlier, in Step 5, you estimated the population of the Prince’s personal domain. Now you’re going to finalize that number and use it to demarcate the territory that belongs to your Prince. Although most of your sandbox is going to have a low population density (discussed below), the territory ruled by your Prince is going to be densely-populated, as befitting a capital region – 450 to 550 families per hex is a good number.

Determine Peasant Population Density for Remainder of Sandbox</h3>\n<p>In this step, you’ll choose the population density of peasant families in your sandbox. This is important because the size of the rulers’ domains is largely determined by their population relative to their population density. The table below shows the Population Density of various historical regions. Since your sandbox is supposed to be a somewhat dangerous frontier territory, we recommend a population density of 20-30 people per square mile (125 – 185 peasant families per 6-mile hex) which is about the population density of the Roman Imperial frontier areas. Choosing a value of 185 or below means that you don’t have to worry about the limits of growth on any hex – they can be civilized, borderlands, or outlands without affecting the population in the hex.</p>\n<p>For the Borderlands, we chose a population density of 30 people per square mile and 185 peasant families per hex.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Historical Era/Region</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Approx.

Demarcate the Territory of the Dukes’ Personal Domains</h3>\n<p>Now you’re going to use the population density you’ve chosen in 7(B) to determine the size of each of the Duke’s personal domains. Just divide the number of families by the population density to calculate the number of 6-mile hexes in each Duke’s territory. If you’ve been following our recommendations, each of the Dukes will have a personal domain of around 1,250 – 1,750 peasant families, so their territory will be around 7 to 9 hexes each. Draw borders on your regional map that encompass the appropriate number of hexes for each Duke’s personal domain.</p>\n<p>In the Borderlands, each of the Palatines (Dukes) has a personal domain of around 1,250 families. At 185 peasant families per hex, that’s (1,250 / 185) = 6.75 hexes per Palatine, rounded to 7 hexes. 7 hexes is our preferred size for a domain centered on an urban settlement because it encompasses the settlement’s hex and 6 other adjacent hexes.</p>\n<p><img src=\"data:image/png;base64...\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h3>D. Demarcate the Territory of the Counts’ Personal Domains</h3>\n<p>Now you’re going to use the population density again to determine the size of each of the Count’s personal domains. Again divide the number of families by the population density to calculate the number of 6-mile hexes in each Count’s territory. If you’ve been following our recommendations, each of the Counts will have a personal domain of around 700 – 850 peasant families, so their territory will be around 4 to 6 hexes each. Draw borders on your regional map that encompass the appropriate number of hexes for each Counts’ personal domain.</p>\n<p>In the borderlands, each of the Legates (Counts) has a personal domain of around 725 peasant families. At 185 peasant families per hex, that’s (725 / 185) = 4 hexes per Legate.</p>\n<p><img src=\"data:image/png;base64...\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h3>E. Demarcate the Territory of the Counties</h3>\n<p>Each Counts is assumed to have 4 - 6 Viscounts and 16 - 24 Barons beneath him. However, we don’t need or want to model those rulers – it makes the map far too messy and it’s largely irrelevant to gameplay.</p>\n<p>Instead, we’re going to abstract them. Back in Step 5, you estimated the size of each Count’s realm and personal domain and in Step 6 you estimate the size of each count’s urban settlement. If you followed our recommendations, it’ll be around 4,600 – 8,500 peasant families and 100 to 250 urban families. Add those together and subtract the total from number of families in each Count’s realm. That tells us how many peasant families are spread out across the various Viscounts and Barons. We then divide that total by the population density of our sandbox and – voila! – we know how much territory is required for the Viscounts and Baronies in total. Add that to the number of hexes in the Count’s personal domain and that’s the size of each County. Draw borders on your regional map that encompass the appropriate number of hexes for each County.</p>\n<p>For simplicity, we recommend making the Counties contiguous so that all of the territory held by Viscounts and Barons can be accessed by the Count without having to travel through another ruler’s realm. However, depending on the terrain of your map, this might not be possible; sometimes you will need to split a realm into parts spread across the map. As long as the personal domains are contiguous, it’s fine if the rest of the territory in the realms is scattered about. Indeed, it’s probably more realistic!</p>\n<p>In the Borderlands, each Legate (Count) has around 3,950 peasant families in his realm, 725 peasant families in his personal domain, and 110 urban families in his urban settlement. That leaves [3,950 – (725 + 110)] 3,115 families in the domains of his vassals. At 185 peasant families per hex, that means each Legate’s County occupies about (3,115 / 185) = 17 hexes.</p>\n<p>Add that to the Legate’s personal domain and it’s 21 hexes per Legature (County). Most of the Legatures are contiguous but not all – a few of the Legates’ personal domains are so hemmed in by inhospitable terrain that the rest of their Legature is some distance away.</p>\n<p>We left all of the named forests and swamps uninhabited. The unnamed northwest of the Krysivor we assumed was inhabited, presumably by woodsmen, trappers, and fisherman on the coast. The unnamed forest near Samos we left outside the Prefecture of the Borderlands entirely; it’s often a good place to drop an elven fastness if your players create elven characters local to the area.</p>\n<p>We counted the small chunks of land in Lake Laman as full hexes for purposes of realm size because of the rule in <em><strong>ACKS II</strong></em>that allows littoral hexes to have higher population densities (p. XX), and allocated them accordingly.</p>\n<p><img src=\"data:image/png;base64...\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h3>F. Demarcate the Territory of the Duchies</h3>\n<p>This step is easy: Just draw a border around the territory of each Duchy that encompasses the Duke’s personal domain and each of the Counties that make up his realm. If the Duke’s realm isn’t contiguous, that’s fine – you can use colors or symbols to differentiate which Duke owns which territory.</p>\n<p>In the Borderlands, the Palatinates (Duchies) are contiguous, with the Palatinate of Menicos in the northeast, the Palatinate of Türos Orn southwest of Menicos, the Palatinate of Samos in the west, and the Palatinate of Siadanos in the southeast.</p>\n<h3>G. Demarcate the Territory of the Principality</h3>\n<p>Draw a border around the territory of the entire Principality, including the Prince’s personal domain and each of the Duchies that make up his realm. Again, if it’s not contiguous, that’s fine! If you’re using map software, you can use this stage to make a political map of the Principality that shows the Duchies in contrasting colors.</p>\n<p>In the Borderlands map below, we’ve illustrated Cyfaraun in red, Samos in orange, Siadanos in purple, Türos Orn in green, and Menicos in blue. The areas colored in grey are realms friendly to the Prefecture of the Borderlands but outside of its borders. The uncolored areas are outside the territory of demi-human or human realms.</p>\n<p><img src=\"data:image/png;base64...\" alt=\"\"></p>\n",

The unnamed forest near Samos we left outside the Prefecture of the Borderlands entirely; it’s often a good place to drop an elven fastness if your players create elven characters local to the area.\n\nWe counted the small chunks of land in Lake Laman as full hexes for purposes of realm size because of the rule in ***ACKS II***that allows littoral hexes to have higher population densities (p. XX), and allocated them accordingly.\n\n![](data:image/png;base64...)\n\n### F. Demarcate the Territory of the Duchies\n\nThis step is easy: Just draw a border around the territory of each Duchy that encompasses the Duke’s personal domain and each of the Counties that make up his realm. If the Duke’s realm isn’t contiguous, that’s fine – you can use colors or symbols to differentiate which Duke owns which territory.\n\nIn the Borderlands, the Palatinates (Duchies) are contiguous, with the Palatinate of Menicos in the northeast, the Palatinate of Türos Orn southwest of Menicos, the Palatinate of Samos in the west, and the Palatinate of Siadanos in the southeast.\n\n### G. Demarcate the Territory of the Principality\n\nDraw a border around the territory of the entire Principality, including the Prince’s personal domain and each of the Duchies that make up his realm. Again, if it’s not contiguous, that’s fine! If you’re using map software, you can use this stage to make a political map of the Principality that shows the Duchies in contrasting colors.\n\nIn the Borderlands map below, we’ve illustrated Cyfaraun in red, Samos in orange, Siadanos in purple, Türos Orn in green, and Menicos in blue. The areas colored in grey are realms friendly to the Prefecture of the Borderlands but outside of its borders. The uncolored areas are outside the territory of demi-human or human realms.\n\n![](data:image/png;base64...)\n"
