  "html": "<h2>Optional Rules</h2>\n<p>A variety of optional rules or expanded rules can be used with abstract dungeons.</p>\n<h3>Finding Monster Parts</h3>\n<p>A party might wish to retrieve monster parts (special components) from the dungeon. They can exchange treasure found for monster parts, up to a limit of their metamphora capacity or the XP of defeated monsters, whichever is lower. This exchange does not alter their chance to find magical items.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: A party that defeats three encounters in a first-level dungeon has earned a base of 270 XP and 1080 GP. If they desire, they may trade 270 GP worth of that 1080 GP for monster parts instead, assuming they have the metamphora to store 270 GP worth of monster parts, giving them 270 XP earned, plus 270 GP worth of monster parts, plus 810 GP.</p>\n<p>The specific monster that the parts come from should be determined by you. You might pick the monsters based on the region and dungeon, you might allow the adventurers to specify the monster parts they are seeking, or determine it randomly by rolling on the dungeon or wilderness encounter chart, as you feel is appropriate for the situation.</p>\n<h3>Multiple Forays</h3>\n<p>Some parties might wish to push their luck and continue foraying after defeating encounters already. If so, the encounter modifier for forays after the first should be calculated based on the total number of encounters that day, plus an additional -1 penalty per foray after the first.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: A party has forayed and cleared two encounters already, before finding that they now have access to a lower dungeon level. They decide to immediately charge on downwards and declare two encounters on the lower level. Their encounter-based difficulty modifier is calculated as if they had declared four encounters (a penalty of -1), plus an additional -1 for being their second foray of the day, for a total of -2 difficulty steps. If they survived that, and declared two more encounters, their penalty would be -2 (for six encounters), plus an additional -2 (for being the third foray), for a total of -4 steps. This example party who has pushed their luck this far has likely died at this point.</p>\n<h3>Random Dungeon Size and Level</h3>\n<p>If you do not want to decide what size and level a randomly located dungeon is, you can determine their values randomly. Roll 1d100 for each on the tables below.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Random Dungeon Level</strong></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Level</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Roll (1d100)</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>1</strong></td>\n<td>1-51</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>2</strong></td>\n<td>52-77</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>3</strong></td>\n<td>78-90</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>4</strong></td>\n<td>91-96</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>5</strong></td>\n<td>97-99</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>6</strong></td>\n<td>100</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Random Dungeon Size</strong></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Size</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Roll (1d100)</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Small</strong></td>\n<td>1-54</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Medium</strong></td>\n<td>55-81</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Large</strong></td>\n<td>82-98</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Mega</strong></td>\n<td>99-100</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h3>Situational Modifiers to Resolution</h3>\n<p>If you want to go into greater detail in the factors that affect dungeon clearing success, you can apply situational modifiers to the resolution roll. These modifiers should affect the resolution roll directly, rather than altering the base difficulty. Below are examples of some potential situational modifiers.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Party Missing Key Role: -1 per key role missing. Key roles are fighter, explorer, mage, crusader, thief, venturer. No adventurer can fill more than one key role at a time, so an elven spellsword could count as a fighter or a mage, but not both at once.</li>\n<li>Well-Balanced Party: +1. A well-balanced party covers all key roles.</li>\n<li>Party Well Prepared for Threats In Dungeon: +2</li>\n<li>Party Poorly Prepared for Threats in Dungeon: -2. An example of being well or poorly prepared would be whether a party brought wolfsbane, belladonna, and silver weapons to fight against werewolves.</li>\n<li>Party Has Unexpectedly Powerful Magic: +1. An example of this might be the PCs lending their henchmen some useful and powerful magic items before sending them off to clear a dungeon.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Generally speaking, a modifier of +/- 1 can be applied for things that are nice but not necessary, while things that are extraordinarily valuable or important receive a modifier of +/- 2. With a few exceptions for things that are suicidal or all but guaranteed, any individual situational modifier should not exceed plus or minus two.</p>\n<h3>Travel Time To Dungeons</h3>\n<p>If you are a Judge who prefers to run low-prep, you might not want to fill out your campaign map with every possible dungeon in every possible hex. The Travel Time rules allow you to use this system without knowing where exactly the dungeons are beforehand; simply roll to find how far away they are from the point that the adventurers set out from. (Usually, this will be a fort, town or city of some kind.)</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Random Travel Time</strong></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Dungeon Size</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Travel Time</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Small</td>\n<td>1d6 days</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Medium</td>\n<td>2d6 days</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Large</td>\n<td>1d6 weeks</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mega</td>\n<td>1d6 months</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The level of civilization of the starting point affects the distance to dungeons. After rolling for base travel time, multiply the result by the starting point modifier: 4x base time if the starting point is Civilized, 2x base time if the starting point is Borderlands, and 1x base time if the starting point is Outlands. Note that the travel time given is one-way, and it will require an equal amount of time to return.</p>\n<h3>Unknown Dungeon Size and Level</h3>\n<p>The Abstract Dungeon rules are written as if the players were aware of the size and level of the dungeon. This works well for solo play and might even be plausible if the adventurers are well-informed, have a dungeon map, etc. However, it is usually a better simulation of actual play if the dungeon size and level are kept secret from the players.</p>\n<p>When the Unknown Dungeon Size and Level rule is in effect, the adventurers must foray without knowing the number of encounters or their level. The party must still declare how many encounters they will face. If they declare a number larger than the actual number remaining in the dungeon, use the modifier only for the number remaining. However, if there is only one encounter remaining, and the party is not aware of that, they receive a +0 modifier instead of +1 (because they needlessly conserve spells and resources).</p>\n<p>Players can scout the dungeon instead of clearing encounters. To scout the dungeon, make a resolution roll as normal, as if the party was facing one-third of the total number of encounters in the dungeon. (Again, to a maximum modifier of +0.) Regardless of the result of this resolution roll, they receive neither experience nor treasure, and no encounters are cleared. Instead, they learn either the dungeon level or the number of encounters remaining in the dungeon, at their choice.</p>\n",
