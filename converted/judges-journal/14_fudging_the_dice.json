When the dice come up in ways that were unexpected or create situations that are uncomfortable or unwanted, the temptation hangs omnipresent to say the dice said something they did not — to fudge.</p>\n<p>Earlier in this chapter, we explained why you should never fudge a meaningful die roll, noting “the desire to fudge is founded on the faulty premise that you need to make sure people have fun. But it’s a mistake to believe that letting a character die destroys fun... It’s fudging the dice that destroys fun, by destroying the ability for the players to make meaningful choices.”</p>\n<p>Having said that, it’s now time to discuss when you should fudge. Obviously, if you should never fudge a meaningful die roll, the universe of available fudging is limited to meaninglessdie rolls. But many die rolls aremeaningless, or seemingly meaningless. Should you fudge some of them? All of them?</p>\n<p>The short answer is that you can fudge a die roll when it benefits play without impacting the ability of the players to make meaningful choices. As an illustration of this general point, here are three situations where fudging makes sense.</p>\n<h3>Fudging for Speed When the Outcome Is Virtually Certain</h3>\n<p>Sometimes, the outcome of a situation is virtually certain. For instance, imagine that there are eight player characters about to attack one easy-to-hit adversary with only 2 hit points remaining. The first player character, Marcus, hits and inflicts 1 point of damage. In this circumstance, it might be appropriate for you to “fudge” the adversary’s remaining hp so that Marcus’s damage is enough to kill, in the interest of speed of play. After all, the adversary is going to die regardless, and depending on the system, going through the attack routine of another character will just waste a lot of time that might be better spent on more meaningful play.</p>\n<p>Note that we said it <strong>might</strong> be appropriate to fudge. But it might not be. If the adversary is a notorious warlord, and whoever lands the killing blow will earn much honor, then who lands the killing blow is meaningful. Or if Marcus wanted to kill the adversary, but his comrade Quintus, acting next in the round, wanted to capture him, then the fact that Marcus didn&#39;t kill the adversary is very meaningful indeed.</p>\n<p>A quick way to determine whether fudging for speed is appropriate is to ask, “If I just narrated this outcome without a die roll, would any player be deprived of meaningful choice and would any player character experience a meaningful difference in the game world?” If the answer is no, fudge away.</p>\n<h3><strong>Fudging for Verisimilitude when the Alternative is Inconsistency</strong></h3>\n<p>Campaign worlds can range from the gonzo (in which internal consistency matters less than the “wow factor”, so that you might have space aliens riding psychic dinosaurs) to the naturalistic (in which internal consistency trumps the wow factor). But even at their most gonzo, most campaign worlds aim for some sense of verisimilitude, that is, some quality of realism, and the need for realism is reflected in much of the “mechanics” of game play.</p>\n<p>For instance, the wandering monster tables in <em><strong>ACKS</strong></em>make it more likely to encounter crocodiles near rivers and cougars near mountains; and more likely to encounter bears in general than to encounter ancient red dragons in general. Thus even a naturalistic GM can use these random encounter tables and have assurance that the will produce results that have some sense of verisimilitude or internal consistency. But sometimes even the best mechanics produce results that make no sense.</p>\n<p>For instance, imagine that at the start of a wilderness adventure, only a few miles from the adventure’s starting village, the very first random encounter is the lair of an ancient red dragon. This “one in a thousand” outcomes poses a tremendous challenge to you as the Judge: Why is there an ancient red dragon living next door to the starting village, and why did no one know about it? Now, you might decide to run with this result. You might decide the dragon had only recently moved in, and its presence was not yet known; or that its presence had always been known, but that talking about it was a taboo, so the villagers hadn’t warned the PCs; or that the villagers were actually evil cultists in cahoots with the dragon, and the adventurers were just another sacrifice sent to die. All of these are examples of excellence in abductive reasoning — of finding a reason to explain a surprising fact.</p>\n<p>But it’s also possible that you had previously established to the players that this was a safe village, with a sage who had briefed the party on local lore; and that the party’s crusaders had already used magic to ascertain the villager’s good intentions. In this case, the dice have created a situation that makes no sense within the context of what’s gone before. Here, you could fudge the dice to create a realistic situation.</p>\n<p>Now, it might be suggested that this fudging has deprived the players of meaningful choice — for instance, of the chance to interact with the red dragon. But as we discussed at length earlier, agency requires precedent. The players in your game cannot make meaningful choices if the world can shift around them with no apparent consistency. There are times when consistency must trump randomness.</p>\n<h3><strong>Fudging to Fix Mistakes</strong></h3>\n<p>From time to time, you will make a mistake. It happens to the best of us. At some point the caffeine-induced high will wear off, the Doritos will mess with your synaptic speed, and you’ll accidentally forget that a Kraken gets to do both standard damage and bonus constriction damage when grappling with a tentacle. Because of this mistake, the situation in the game world will bear no relation to what it would have been had you not erred. If you value consistency and realism in your game play (or are simply a compulsive perfectionist), this is a traumatic moment.</p>\n<p>In the face of this situation, you can simply ignore the error and keep playing. This is fine in most cases, but if your error has been egregious and involves critical aspects of the game (or major adversaries), it won’t be acceptable. Your second option is to “rewind” gameplay — but this is often impossible.</p>\n<p>Your third option is to fudge some die rolls to get things back on track. For example, if you realize you’ve been rolling only half the appropriate amount of damage for the villain, you might fudge some damage rolls to be higher over the next few rounds. Or, if you accidentally have been hitting a player character you actually missed, you could fudge your next few attack rolls to ensure some misses occur.</p>\n<p>It&#39;s important to keep in mind the goal of this sort of fudging: You are not trying to alter the outcome to fit some preconceived notion of what the dice ought to have rolled. You are, rather, adjusting the dice to fix errors you created. Done properly, the outcome should be close to what would have happened if you&#39;d never erred at all.</p>\n<p>Are there any other circumstances where fudging makes sense in the context of agency-driven sandbox play? There might be, but we haven’t encountered them if so. The three above are by far the most common ones an <em><strong>ACKS</strong></em>Judge will encounter. But every campaign is a law unto itself, and you might encounter situations we haven’t thought of that demand fudging. Be cautious but do what you deem best to maintain player agency in your world.</p>\n",
