Hit points are <em>not</em> a direct representation of the character’s capacity to receive physical injury. A character with 40 hp cannot survive eight sword stabs to the stomach! Rather, they represent a holistic combination of fighting skill, stamina, luck, and the favor of the gods, all of which contribute to helping the character roll with blows and survive attacks that would have killed a lesser combatant.

When the normal man is dealt 4 points of damage by a sword, this is a grievous blow (80% of his hit points); when the epic hero is dealt the same 4 points of damage, this is merely a flesh wound (10% of his hp). This is exactly as it should be. Yet when the epic hero is treated with <em>cure light injury</em>, he recovers 1d6+1 points of damage – enough to repair a light wound, as the spell suggests; while when the normal man is treated with <em>cure light injury</em>, he is likely to recover from what we just said was a grievous blow that brought him near death.

For each full day of dedicated rest in reasonably sanitary conditions, a creature will recover its <strong>base healing rate (BHR)</strong>. If its rest is interrupted, the creature will not heal that day. A creature’s base healing rate is based on its maximum hit points, as shown on the Base Healing Rate table. A character’s BHR should be recorded on its character sheet, and updated each time the character gains additional hit points.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: Athelstan has 12 hp.

A creature’s base healing rate is based on its maximum hit points, as shown on the Base Healing Rate table.
