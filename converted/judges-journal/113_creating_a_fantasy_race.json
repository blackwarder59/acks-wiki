  "rawMarkdown": "## Creating a Fantasy Race\n\nFollow these steps to create a custom fantasy race for your campaign:\n\n1. Develop a name and concept for the fantasy race. Is it a sinister race of serpent-men with access to dark magic? Is it a titanic race of giant-sized humanoids? Perhaps it is a race of human-sized talking rabbits. The concept should drive your choice in the remaining steps.\n2. Determine the ability score requirements for the race (see Requirements below).\n3. Determine any modifications or restrictions that may apply to the race’s allocation of build points to the class category values (see Class Category Values below).\n4. Select one or more custom powers for the fantasy race and assign them to the racial values of 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 (see Racial Powers below)\n5. Calculate the cost for racial value 0.\n   1. Count the total number of racial powers available at racial value 0. Remember that some racial powers count as negative, half, two, or other variable numbers of powers.\n   2. For each racial power, increase the cost of the race at this value by 40 XP, or more if the power is directly applicable to all of the race’s likely classes (see Racial Powers below).\n   3. For each racial power that is a spell-like ability, increase the cost of the race at this value by 65 XP + 5 XP per level of the spell (see Racial Powers below).\n   4. If the race’s racial value mimics or stacks with a class category value (such as Elf and Arcane), add the cost of the mimicked class value at that level.\n   5. If the race’s racial value mimics or stacks with a negative class category value (such as Halfling and HD), subtract the cost of the mimicked class value.\n   6. Subtract 40 XP from this total to represent the fact that racial classes lose maximum levels of experience.\n6. Calculate the cost for racial value 1, 2, 3, and 4 by repeating these steps.\n7. Calculate the additional cost per level after 8.\n   1. If the race’s racial value mimics a class category value (such as Elf and Arcane), divide the Racial Value XP cost at Value 4 by the cost for elf 4 (2,625) and multiply the result by 50,000. Round to the nearest 5,000. This is the additional cost per level after 8.\n   2. If the race’s racial value does not mimic a class category value (such as Dwarf), divide the Racial Value XP cost at Value 4 by the cost for dwarf 4 (1,400). Pick two saving throw progressions, and for those progressions multiply the result by 10,000. For all other saving throw progressions, multiply the result by 30,000. Round to the nearest 25,000. This is the additional cost per level after 8.\n   3. If the race is monstrous (as determined by you), the cost per level after 8 continues to double. Apply this rule for races that are particularly inhuman and powerful.\n8. You’re finished. Time to build a class using your new fantasy race!\n"
