If you do want to create your own Wandering Monsters by Level tables, read on.</p>\n<p>The first consideration in designing random encounter tables is providing a mix of challenges. As you’ll recall from Chapter 2, the Wandering Monsters by Level tables are sub-divided into columns by Monster Level, with 12 rows per column.
