Divide this number by six to find the <strong>scaling modifier</strong>. Multiply the number of mortal wounds rolled by the scaling modifier.

Rolling 1d4-1, they roll a 4, indicating a base of three mortal wounds. However, because there are fourteen participants in the expedition, their scaling modifier is (14/6) = 2.33. Three mortal wounds times 2.33 indicates that the expedition suffers seven mortal wounds.</p>\n<p>When one or more expedition participants suffer a mortal wound, determine which participant was injured randomly. When randomly determining which participant suffered the wound, no participant can suffer a second wound unless every participant has already suffered one. An adventurer who suffers a mortal wound can no longer participate in the expedition until they recover. Roll on the Mortal Wounds - Savage table using only the adventurer&#39;s Constitution, and HD, and equipment modifiers as adjustments to the d20. An adventurer whose mortal wound requires that he be healed to 1 HP dies unless the party can heal the character or bring him back to civilization in the time allotted.</p>\n<p>If a unit suffers a mortal wound, 50% of the unit members are casualties. If the resolution result was Indifferent or better, 50% of the casualties will recover in one week. If the resolution result was worse than Indifferent, all the casualties are slain.</p>\n<p>In addition, armies in the field are always in danger of attrition and casualties even in a won battle. After the resolution roll, each unwounded unit that benefited the Army Adjustment of the expedition must make a successful Death saving throw or suffer 5% casualties. Casualties will recover or die, as above, based on whether or not the resolution roll was at least Indifferent.</p>\n<p>Units that have suffered casualties and are under-strength contribute less to Army Adjustment. Reduce their effective Battle Rating by their percentage under-strength. Round up to the nearest 0.5 BR. Units can be combined if sufficient casualties were suffered.</p>\n",
