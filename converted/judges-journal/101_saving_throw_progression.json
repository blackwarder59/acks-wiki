The saving throw progression is critical, because it also determines the character’s magical item options, prime requisite, proficiencies, and hit points after 9th level.</p>\n<p>To determine which saving throw progression your class uses, follow these steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Compare the values for Fighting, Thievery, Divine, and Arcane.</li>\n<li>If the rating for one category is highest, use the Saving Throw progression for the core class which is associated with that category - fighter for Fighting, thief for Thievery, crusader for Divine, and mage for Arcane.</li>\n<li>If two or more abilities are tied, use the progression for the first of the tied categories to appear in order on this list: Arcane, then Divine, then Fighting, then Thievery.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>EXAMPLE: A custom class has the values Hit Die 0, Fighting 0, Thievery 0, Divine 2, Arcane 2. The class uses the saving throw progression for mages, because Arcane takes priority over Divine.</p>\n<h3>Magical Items</h3>\n<p>Every custom class has access to magical items useable by all classes as well as the ability to use enchanted versions of weapons and armor available to it based on its Fighting Value. A custom class will also gain access to magic items useable by the core class associated with its saving throw progression, and for any class category with a value of at least 2 assigned.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE #1: A custom class has the values Hit Die 0, Fighting 0, Thievery 0, Divine 2, Arcane 2. The class uses the saving throw progression for mages, so it can use magical items restricted to mages. The class can also use magic items restricted to crusaders, because it has a Divine value of 2.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE #2: A custom class has the values Hit Die 0, Fighting 1, Thievery 2, Divine 0, Arcane 1. The class uses the saving throw progression for thieves, so it can use magical items restricted to thieves. Even though the class can cast arcane spells, it cannotuse magic items restricted to mages because it only has an Arcane value of 1.</p>\n<h3>Key Attributes</h3>\n<p>Every custom class must have a key attribute. The prime requisite is determined by the class’s saving throw progression: Either STR or CON for fighter, INT for mage, WIL for crusader, and either DEX or CHA for thieves. The key attribute is chosen when the class is created.</p>\n<p>In most cases, an additional key attribute is added for each class category (excluding HD value) in which a value of at least 2 is assigned. These requirements can be waived or expanded by the GM if he deems it necessary for balance or class favor.</p>\n<h3>Proficiencies</h3>\n<p>Each custom class gets one general proficiency as a starting class power.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: The standard fighter has Manual of Arms, a general proficiency, as a starting class power.</p>\n<p>Each custom class also begins with one class proficiency and one general proficiency, selected by the template or roll or player’s choice, at 1st level. All classes share the same general proficiency list. Each custom class should be assigned a custom list of class proficiencies specifically chosen to reflect its powers and background. The custom class’s proficiency list could be drawn from whichever class it saves as, and/or from class categories with a value of at least 1 assigned. If desired, you can create new and unique proficiencies for the custom class’s proficiency list as well.</p>\n<p><strong>Number of Proficiencies in Class List:</strong> The number of proficiencies available to a custom class is always equal to (42 - maximum level). For most classes, this will be 28 proficiencies. Certain racial classes (described later) will have more proficiencies on their class list.</p>\n<p><strong>Specialized Selection:</strong> When a class list only has access to a specialized selection within either Art, Craft, Performance, or Profession, such as Performance (dance) or Profession (mortician), count that specialized selection as only 1/2 a proficiency for purposes of the class list.</p>\n<h3>Hit Points after 9th Level</h3>\n<p>A custom class’s saving throw progression determines how many hit points it gains per level after 9th, according to the following mechanic:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Crusader or Mage:</strong> 1 hit point per level after 9th</li>\n<li><strong>Fighter or Thief:</strong> 2 hit points per level after 9th</li>\n</ul>\n",

Compare the values for Fighting, Thievery, Divine, and Arcane.\n2. If the rating for one category is highest, use the Saving Throw progression for the core class which is associated with that category - fighter for Fighting, thief for Thievery, crusader for Divine, and mage for Arcane.\n3. If two or more abilities are tied, use the progression for the first of the tied categories to appear in order on this list: Arcane, then Divine, then Fighting, then Thievery.\n\nEXAMPLE: A custom class has the values Hit Die 0, Fighting 0, Thievery 0, Divine 2, Arcane 2. The class uses the saving throw progression for mages, because Arcane takes priority over Divine.\n\n### Magical Items\n\nEvery custom class has access to magical items useable by all classes as well as the ability to use enchanted versions of weapons and armor available to it based on its Fighting Value.
