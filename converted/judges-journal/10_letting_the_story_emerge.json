  "html": "<h2>Letting the Story Emerge</h2>\n<p>The agency theory of fun we introduced earlier asserts that by focusing on objective rules, honest dice, and player choice, you maximize the fun for your players in the long term. This theory is almost entirely incompatible with the narrativist school of gamemastering that has dominated in the past two decades, which teaches that telling a story is the most important function of the GM, with a particular emphasis on the need to create a “story arc” for the players to follow.</p>\n<p>Stories, of course, are as old as mankind, but not every story is part of a story arc. Consider the early Greek myths of Perseus slaying the Medusa, and of Bellerophon slaying the Chimera. Each has a story “line,” but there is no link between the two. In contrast, consider the later myths of Paris wooing Helen of Troy, Achilles slaying Hector, and Odysseus encountering Circe — these are all linked by the &quot;Trojan War&quot; story arc. For a more recent example, contrast the adventures of Robert Howard’s Conan (short stories enjoyable in any order without a story arc) with Tolkien&#39;s Bilbo and Frodo (adventures within a larger story arc).</p>\n<p>Many people&#39;s earliest experiences of role-playing games are similar to those early Greek myths or Conan short stories. The party of adventurers goes to the dungeon, knocks down some doors, kills some orcs, and goes home. Next week’s adventure, they knock down some thicker doors, kill some ogres, and so on. The first published RPG products that actually linked adventures across space and time was Gary Gygax&#39;s G-D-Q series of modules (<em><strong>Against the Giants</strong></em> leading to <em><strong>Vault of the Drow</strong></em> culminating in <em><strong>Queen of the Demonweb Pits</strong></em>). But the big breakthrough came when TSR gave us the <em><strong>Dragonlance</strong></em>series, which featured a story arc over a dozen modules long.</p>\n<p>To players in the mid ‘80s, story arcs were revolutionary, adding highly detailed backgrounds, flavorful depth, and a sense of purpose to what had previously been only loosely connected modules. And those are all wonderful things, things that any good <em><strong>ACKS</strong></em>Judge should strive to have in his games. But there was a hidden cost to the story arc: a cost in player agency. A story arc only works if the narrator can create a plot — that is: a sequence of events that effects change on the situation of his protagonists. If the narrator is a gamemaster, then the players are his protagonists, and he&#39;s made a commitment to effecting change on them. The players are now the objects, rather than subjects, of a story. A story arc transforms adventurers and agents into actors and audience.</p>\n<p>For this reason, we call campaigns that use a story arc “<strong>directed stories</strong>.” The gamemaster, like a stage or movie director, is directing the sequence of events that will occur with an eye towards achieving particular outcomes or expressing particular themes. It is story focused on what happens next. The opposite of directed story is “<strong>emergent story</strong>,” story focused on what just happened. Emergent story is the memoirs of your fictional characters, and the history of their fictional deeds.</p>\n<p>A directed story GM is concerned with whether or not what the players are doing is moving things in the direction the gamemaster desires. An emergent story GM is concerned with whether or not the players are succeeding in moving things in the direction the players desire.</p>\n<p><em><strong>ACKS</strong></em>is intended to be a game of emergent stories, not directed stories.</p>\n<h3>A Web, Not an Arc</h3>\n<p>Emergent story does not happen in a vacuum. You cannot simply release your players into the Auran Empire and expect entertainment to ensue — or if entertainment does ensue, it will likely be very short term and involve inns, bar brawls, or orcs. Emergent story needs its own version of the story arc, but one catered to emergent play. The technique we recommend to enable emergent storytelling is something we call a “<strong>story web</strong>.”</p>\n<p>The story web approach is location based, rather than event based. It begins with a map of the region within which the campaign will launch (often called the “<strong>sandbox</strong>”), and developing a few dozen “<strong>points of interest</strong>” within it. Points of interest are simply locations in your game world that will be interesting to adventurers. Different Judges use different methods to create their points of interest. You could use a mix of free-form creativity, adaptation/borrowing of other published material, rolls on random encounter charts, or other techniques. A good point of interest is not more than a paragraph or two in length. Here’s an example of a point of interest from Autarch’s official campaign setting, the Borderlands of the Auran Empire:</p>\n<p><strong>21. Shrine of the White Lady:</strong> Hidden in a secluded forest clearing is an ivy-covered shrine of white marble, sacred to Demara, the White Lady, built by the elves when they ruled Southern Argollë. The shrine is guarded by a <strong>unicorn</strong> (20 hp) who protects it from the monsters of the Viaspen Forest. Within the shrine is a pool of crystal-clear water. The waters of the pool carry a fey magic. Any Lawful character who drinks from it is relieved of one side effect from <strong>tampering with mortality</strong>; in exchange for this boon, the character receives a <em>quest</em> to destroy Chaotic creatures in Southern Argollë. The pool’s waters work but once in a character’s lifetime. The ceiling of the shrine carries a mosaic map of the Borderlands as it stood before the Argollëan War and shows the locations of Cyfaraun (#10), the Collapsed Elven Keep (#16), the Ruined City of Cyfandir (#25), and the Watchtower at Eammon Mór (45).</p>\n<p>Once you’ve come up with some points of interest, you go back and look for possible links between them — proximity, shared history, etc. The idea is that since story is going to emerge from the characters encountering interesting stuff, the story web should help them move from one point of interest to another. The Shrine of the White Lady, for instance, has a ceiling mosaic that shows the path to four other points of interest that were all historically linked to the fallen elven kingdom.</p>\n<p>But having a mosaic in a point of interest is just one way of linking up the story web. Other ways players could uncover links between locations in your sandbox include finding treasure maps in hoards that lead to another point of interest; rescuing captives that hail from another place; translating hieroglyphic carvings on the wall that mention another point of interest; reading NPC journals about other locations; talking to NPCs who traveled between the two locations; and so on.</p>\n<p>What contrasts the story web from the story arc is that it offers two different layers of choice. The first layer of choice is that at any point the party has multiple threads of the web to pursue. Do they want to see where the treasure map leads, or visit the elven ruins they learned about from the mosaic? The second layer of choice is the ability for the party to ignore the web entirely. Since the points of interest exist independently as locations in the game world, the party can go explore as it would like. In short, the story web is a road network to a range of destinations, not a railroad track leading down one way.</p>\n<p>With a story web, you can&#39;t be sure that your players will encounter #1 before #2, or #2 before #10. Nor can you be sure they&#39;ll encounter any particular location, character, or monster at all. You have established a setting, but the story that occurs within that setting will be the result of player choice. They will be enjoying an emergent story as they move along the strands of your story web. (Or they may enjoy burning your story web to the ground, as the case may be.)</p>\n<p>At a certain point in the course of running your campaign, you might begin to feel the urge to transform the emergent story into a directed story. You might find yourself saying, &quot;The Lost Temple of Arneson is so cool! I really want them to go there.&quot; And so the local King will come down with Bubonic Ebola, which will only be cured if the Polyhedral of Power can be recovered from the Lost Temple. Now, there&#39;s nothing wrong with this per se; later in this book we offer a set of random charts to create background events in your setting, and one of them really can inflict pestilence on the population.</p>\n<p>But to stay true to player agency, you need to be willing to let your players say, &quot;Nah. I&#39;d rather go check out the Tower of Gygax. Pass the King our best wishes for his recovery.&quot; You need to run with what the players want to do. Maybe that means the King dies, and the land is in upheaval. Maybe it means that another adventurer recovers the Polyhedral, and the PCs suddenly have rivals for their fame in the land. Maybe it means that the King declares them outlaws, and they join forces with the monsters. Again, the point is that the story isn&#39;t something you decide alone. The story emerges from what the players decide.</p>\n<p>Don’t let yourself get too disconcerted about the challenges of emergent storytelling. <em><strong>ACKS</strong></em>is built from the ground-up to make it happen, and in subsequent chapters we’ll give you all the tools you need to create an amazing sandbox. This section is just providing you with the philosophical framework to understand what comes later.</p>\n",
