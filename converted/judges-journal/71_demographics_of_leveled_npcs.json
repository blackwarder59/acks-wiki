Levelled characters become increasingly rare with each level after 1st. The exact frequency at which leveled characters appear in a population depends on the nature of the civilization to which the population belongs. The Demographics of Leveled NPCs tables, below, show the frequencies at which leveled characters occur for civilized human realms, demi-human realms, and barbarian realms.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Demographics of Leveled NPCs in Human Realm</strong></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Level</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Frequency</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Possible Realm</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1 in 40</td>\n<td>Extended Family</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1 in 100</td>\n<td>Tiny hamlet</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>1 in 285</td>\n<td>Small barony or hamlet</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>1 in 780</td>\n<td>Barony or village</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>1 in 2,150</td>\n<td>Small viscounty or large village</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>1 in 5,900</td>\n<td>Viscounty or large town</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>1 in 16,225</td>\n<td>Small county or small city</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>1 in 45,000</td>\n<td>County or large city</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>1 in 111,500</td>\n<td>Small duchy or large city</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>1 in 280,000</td>\n<td>Duchy or metropolis</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>1 in 627,000</td>\n<td>Principality or huge metropolis</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>1 in 1,725,000</td>\n<td>Large principality or small kingdom</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>1 in 4,750,000</td>\n<td>Kingdom</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>1 in 13,000,000</td>\n<td>Empire</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Demographics of Leveled NPCs in Demi-human Realm</strong></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Level</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Frequency</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Possible Realm</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1 in 20</td>\n<td>Extended Family</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1 in 50</td>\n<td>Hamlet</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>1 in 150</td>\n<td>Small barony</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>1 in 375</td>\n<td>Barony or village</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>1 in 1,000</td>\n<td>Small viscounty or large village</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>1 in 3,000</td>\n<td>Viscounty or large town</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>1 in 8,000</td>\n<td>County or city</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>1 in 20,000</td>\n<td>Large county or city</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>1 in 60,000</td>\n<td>Duchy or large city</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>1 in 160,000</td>\n<td>Small principality or metropolis</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>1 in 450,000</td>\n<td>Principality</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>1 in 1,200,000</td>\n<td>Small kingdom</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>1 in 3,250,000</td>\n<td>Kingdom</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>1 in 10,000,000</td>\n<td>Empire</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Demographics of Leveled NPC in Barbarian Clanhold</strong></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Level</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Frequency</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Possible Realm</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1 in 15</td>\n<td>Extended Family</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1 in 25</td>\n<td>Extended Family</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>1 in 40</td>\n<td>Extended Family</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>1 in 60</td>\n<td>Hamlet</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>1 in 165</td>\n<td>Hamlet</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>1 in 400</td>\n<td>Small barony</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>1 in 900</td>\n<td>Barony or village</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>1 in 2,100</td>\n<td>Small viscounty</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>1 in 5,000</td>\n<td>Viscounty</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>1 in 15,000</td>\n<td>Small Jarldom</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>1 in 40,000</td>\n<td>Jarldom</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>1 in 115,000</td>\n<td>Small Barbarian Kingdom</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>1 in 265,000</td>\n<td>Barbarian Kingdom</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>1 in 550,000</td>\n<td>Barbarian High Kingdom</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>Civilized human realms have the lowest proportion of leveled characters. The crushing reality of agricultural economics leaves only a small elite available to study war, magic, and theology. Only 1 in 40 inhabitants of, e.g., the Auran Empire is 1st level. There are only 2 adults per 5 inhabitants, so 1 in 16 (6.25%) of human adults is 1st level.</p>\n<p>Demi-human realms have a higher proportion of leveled characters. Demi-humans have longer lifespans than humans, which offers more opportunity for members of their races to gain levels. They also face more frequent incursions from beastmen raiders. Therefore, 1 in 20 inhabitants of a typical elven fastness or dwarven vault, or 1 in 8 adults (12.5%) of demi-human adults is 1st level.</p>\n<p>Clanholds and nomad hordes, of the sort found in Ulruk, Jutland, and Skysostan, have the highest proportion of leveled characters. 1 in 15 inhabitants, or 1 in 6 adults (16.7%) of tribal and nomad realms are 1st level. Fortunately for the inhabitants of civilized realms, clanholds and nomad hordes tend to have much lower population densities, so the higher frequency of leveled characters does not necessarily overwhelm the number in civilized realms.</p>\n<p>We strongly encourage you to use these demographics to guide the number of leveled NPCs you place in your <em>ACKS</em> campaigns. Everything from the personal authority of leaders, the GP thresholds for campaign XP, and the expected wealth of characters by level is attuned to these demographics.</p>\n<p>That said, the Demographics of Leveled Characters should not be treated like a straitjacket on your creativity. If your campaign calls for a demographically-unlikely number of powerful mages in a particular city, so be it. Just be aware of the implications!</p>\n<h3>Leveled NPCs of Aurëpos</h3>\n<p>The table below provides the frequency by class and level of leveled characters within the population of Aurëpos, home of the Auran Empire.

The most important fact to note is that, while there are sufficient commanders available to lead the armies of Aurëpos, there are not enough lieutenants available to staff every unit: a typical realm will simply not have a lieutenant available for every unit of each size. Moreover, lieutenants become progressively scarcer for larger units, which nicely reflects the real-world difficulty of finding competent people capable of managing large bodies of troops. In a company-sized battle, fewer than half (46%) of the units will have lieutenants, and in a huge brigade-scale battle, less than a quarter (24%) will.</p>\n<h3>Age of Leveled NPCs</h3>\n<p>Using the XP thresholds and the mathematics for earning XP from campaign activities, we can calculate the minimum age of various NPCs if they have not undertaken adventuring or other high-risk activities. Note that these are minimums – they assume that at every step, the NPC has the resources necessary to advance. If those resources are not available, the increase in XP threshold by level will ensure they do not make progress. For instance, a tribune will never advance from 5th level, no matter how old he gets, if his domain income remains below his XP threshold.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fighter/Other (noble)</strong> includes aristocrats, nobles, and patricians with opportunities for command and rulership from a young age, either from inherited lands or a ladder of offices such as the <em>cursus honorum</em>. They accumulate XP from their rule and advance relatively quickly (though not so quickly as adventurers!). Around 7th level, they hit middle age.</li>\n<li><strong>Fighter/Other (magistrate)</strong> represents the armigers, knights, serjeants, stewards, and other retainers of the nobility, who work as magistrates in their domains. They accumulate XP from the fee paid for their magistrature. Because they do not directly rule domains, they advance much slower. It would not be uncommon for a 40-year old 9th level prefect to have a 56-year old guard captain or steward of 7th level. Magistrates with ambitions for swifter progress often seek to become domain rulers themselves, usually at the expense of their ostensible lords.</li>\n<li><strong>Fighter/Other (commoner/enlisted)</strong> represents the path of common enlisted troops of the realm. They are assumed to fight no more than one major battle every other year, gaining battle and spoils XP in each battle. Veteran troops (1st level characters) will generally be the survivors of 5-7 battles over 15 years. Across all troops, the average age of active-duty troops is 28, the average age of veteran soldiers is 36, and the average age of retired soldiers is 50.</li>\n<li><strong>Crusader (proselytizer)</strong> encompasses all those divine spellcasters who peacefully advance in level by means of acquiring divine power from congregants and returning it to their patron deity. This a slow process, as the faithful are few in number. Crusaders, priestesses, and shamans who have advanced by proselytization will be almost 70 years old by the time they reach 11th level. Note that divine power alone is not sufficient to enable a crusader to reach 14th level; for this he must be a theocratic ruler!</li>\n<li><strong>Mage (researcher)</strong> includes those arcane spellcasters who peacefully advance in level through magical research. At lower levels they work as assistants for more advanced colleagues, while at higher levels they pursue their own projects. If a mage is fortunate enough to have a steady supply of gold and special components, advancement can be relatively swift. In many cases, however, mages lack the resources they need to advance.</li>\n<li><strong>Thief (carouser)</strong> represents the thieves, assassins, bards, and other streetwise types. They are assumed to advance in level by perpetrating petty hijinks such as carousing. As a result, they advance quite slowly.

As such they will have already lost at least 2 points of STR, DEX, and CON, making them (relatively) weaker than comparable PCs of the same level who have advanced quicker. This helps explain both why adventurers are often called on to quests by various patrons, as well as why adventurers can, when ready, claim crowns and take thrones.</p>\n<p><strong>Designer’s Note:</strong> Because of their unpleasant complexity, we have excluded the comprehensive workbooks that were used to calculate these numbers.

For instance, if your campaign entails that a 1st level halfling owns a legendary magic item, so be it (that might make a suitable basis for a great campaign!). However, in most cases, those who are most powerful will have the most powerful magic items.</p>\n<h3>Entourages of Leveled Character</h3>\n<p>One of the common questions that every <em>ACKS</em> Judge faces is deciding how much high-level help a ruler can call on. Does a 9th level duke have a mage on his payroll? What level is the chief priest of a principality ruled by a 12th level mage? To solve this problem, we first made some simplifying assumptions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Every ruler pays himself a wage equal to his henchman salary. He uses this wage for rent, food, drink, ordinary servants, pets, and so on.</li>\n<li>Every ruler allocates an amount of treasure equal to the supply cost needed to field his own fighting forces. During campaign months, these funds are used for supply troops; during other months, they might be spent on agricultural investments or stronghold construction.</li>\n<li>The amount of treasure available to hire an entourage of supporters is therefore equal to Domain Income – (Ruler Salary + Supply Cost).</li>\n<li>In addition, every ruler pays 1gp per family per month in tithes towards the local ecclesiastics. While not directly under the control of the ruler, these crusaders tend to be cooperative with and supportive of a ruler who pays his tithes and upholds the law. The amount of treasure spent on maintaining clergy is equal to the tithes paid.</li>\n<li>If desired, “non-cleric” funds can be spent on clerics, but not vice versa.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Since we know the number of rulers of each level, their average domain income, their salaries by level, and their domain tithes, we can work out the gp value of entourages. Note that is the maximumentourage of an averageruler. Because salary changes with level, rulers with the same title who pay themselves a higher salary will have smaller entourages and vice versa. Each ruler would, of course, choose for himself.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Ruler</strong>  <strong>Level</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Ruler</strong>  <strong>Title</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Domain</strong>  <strong>Income</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Ruler</strong>  <strong>Salary</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Supply</strong>  <strong>Cost</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Domain</strong>  <strong>Tithe</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Entourage</strong>  <strong>(Non-Clerical)</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Entourage</strong>  <strong>(Clerical)</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>3</strong></td>\n<td>Baron</td>\n<td>656</td>\n<td>100</td>\n<td>73</td>\n<td>157</td>\n<td>483</td>\n<td>157</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>4</strong></td>\n<td>Baron</td>\n<td>656</td>\n<td>200</td>\n<td>73</td>\n<td>157</td>\n<td>383</td>\n<td>157</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>5</strong></td>\n<td>Viscount</td>\n<td>2,831</td>\n<td>400</td>\n<td>189</td>\n<td>351</td>\n<td>2,242</td>\n<td>351</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>6</strong></td>\n<td>Viscount</td>\n<td>2,831</td>\n<td>800</td>\n<td>189</td>\n<td>351</td>\n<td>1,842</td>\n<td>351</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>7</strong></td>\n<td>Count</td>\n<td>8,444</td>\n<td>1,600</td>\n<td>535</td>\n<td>982</td>\n<td>6,309</td>\n<td>982</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>8</strong></td>\n<td>Count</td>\n<td>8,444</td>\n<td>3,000</td>\n<td>535</td>\n<td>982</td>\n<td>4,909</td>\n<td>982</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>9</strong></td>\n<td>Duke</td>\n<td>22,655</td>\n<td>7,250</td>\n<td>1,480</td>\n<td>2,658</td>\n<td>13,925</td>\n<td>2,658</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>10</strong></td>\n<td>Duke</td>\n<td>22,655</td>\n<td>12,000</td>\n<td>1,480</td>\n<td>2,658</td>\n<td>9,175</td>\n<td>2,658</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>11</strong></td>\n<td>Prince</td>\n<td>88,414</td>\n<td>32,000</td>\n<td>6,810</td>\n<td>13,065</td>\n<td>49,604</td>\n<td>13,065</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>12</strong></td>\n<td>Prince</td>\n<td>88,414</td>\n<td>50,000</td>\n<td>6,810</td>\n<td>13,065</td>\n<td>31,604</td>\n<td>13,065</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>13 + 14</strong></td>\n<td>King</td>\n<td>214,294</td>\n<td>135,000</td>\n<td>17,340</td>\n<td>34,156</td>\n<td>61,954</td>\n<td>34,156</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>14</strong></td>\n<td>Emperor</td>\n<td>911,172</td>\n<td>350,000</td>\n<td>49,500</td>\n<td>112,500</td>\n<td>511,672</td>\n<td>112,500</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>Below are sample entourages showing how funds could be spent. The specific entourage of any given NPC should be chosen by you with reference to the Demographics of Leveled Characters in your setting.</p>\n<p>Members of a ruler’s entourage might be followers or henchmen, or might be non-henchmen mercenaries retained for pay. If the latter, they will have the loyalty of Mercenary Commanders or Non-Henchmen Vassals depending on their relationship and treatment (Judge’s discretion). Since henchmen slots are limited and followers are only available at high level, most rulers are forced to choose between having untrustworthy people in their entourage or having untrustworthy people managing their sub-domains.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: The adventurers are attacking Aura to claim the throne, where they will face the usurper Tarkaun Drakomir. Drakomir is a 14th level fighter. As an emperor, he can call on a maximum of 1 divine spellcasters of 12th, 11th, and 10th level, and 2 9th level divine casters. He can call on 2 other NPCs of 13th, 12th, and 11th level, 3 of 10th level, and 6 of 9th level. The Judge decides the emperor’s entourage is as follows:</p>\n<p>Regent of the Tower of Knowledge: 1 x 13th level mage</p>\n<p>Prefect of the Emperor’s Talons: 1 x 13th level fighter</p>\n<p>Grand Patriarch of the Temple of the Winged Sun: 1 x 12th level crusader</p>\n<p>Master of Spies: 1 x 12th level thief</p>\n<p>Master of Coin: 1 x 12th level venturer</p>\n<p>Matriarch of the Keepers of the Hearth Fire: 1 x 11th level priestess</p>\n<p>Blade-Mistress of the Temple of the Blade and Veil: 1 x 10th level bladedancer</p>\n<p>Patriarchs of the Temple of the Winged Sun: 2 x 9th level crusaders</p>\n<p>Officers of the Emperor’s Talons: 3 x 10th level fighters, 2 x 9th level assassins, 2 x 9th level bards, 2 x 9th level fighters</p>\n<p>The emperor has CHA 13 and Leadership proficiency, enabling him to have 6 henchmen. As Tarkaun of Aura, he has five vassals: the exarchs of Krysea, Nicea, Opelenea, Southern Argollë, and Tirenea. The Judge decides that the exarchs of Krysea, Nicea, and Southern Argollë are henchmen, while those of Opelenea and Tirenea are non-henchman vassals. That leaves the emperor with 3 henchmen available. The Judge decides that the Prefect of the Emperor’s Talons, the Master of Spies, and the Master of Coin are his henchmen. The other members of the entourage are non-henchmen and thus less loyal.</p>\n<h6>Emperor’s Sample

The Demographics of Leveled NPCs tables, below, show the frequencies at which leveled characters occur for civilized human realms, demi-human realms, and barbarian realms.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Demographics of Leveled NPCs in Human Realm</strong></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Level</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Frequency</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Possible Realm</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1 in 40</td>\n<td>Extended Family</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1 in 100</td>\n<td>Tiny hamlet</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>1 in 285</td>\n<td>Small barony or hamlet</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>1 in 780</td>\n<td>Barony or village</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>1 in 2,150</td>\n<td>Small viscounty or large village</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>1 in 5,900</td>\n<td>Viscounty or large town</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>1 in 16,225</td>\n<td>Small county or small city</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>1 in 45,000</td>\n<td>County or large city</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>1 in 111,500</td>\n<td>Small duchy or large city</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>1 in 280,000</td>\n<td>Duchy or metropolis</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>1 in 627,000</td>\n<td>Principality or huge metropolis</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>1 in 1,725,000</td>\n<td>Large principality or small kingdom</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>1 in 4,750,000</td>\n<td>Kingdom</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>1 in 13,000,000</td>\n<td>Empire</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Demographics of Leveled NPCs in Demi-human Realm</strong></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Level</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Frequency</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Possible Realm</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1 in 20</td>\n<td>Extended Family</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1 in 50</td>\n<td>Hamlet</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>1 in 150</td>\n<td>Small barony</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>1 in 375</td>\n<td>Barony or village</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>1 in 1,000</td>\n<td>Small viscounty or large village</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>1 in 3,000</td>\n<td>Viscounty or large town</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>1 in 8,000</td>\n<td>County or city</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>1 in 20,000</td>\n<td>Large county or city</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>1 in 60,000</td>\n<td>Duchy or large city</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>1 in 160,000</td>\n<td>Small principality or metropolis</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>1 in 450,000</td>\n<td>Principality</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>1 in 1,200,000</td>\n<td>Small kingdom</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>1 in 3,250,000</td>\n<td>Kingdom</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>1 in 10,000,000</td>\n<td>Empire</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Demographics of Leveled NPC in Barbarian Clanhold</strong></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Level</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Frequency</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Possible Realm</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1 in 15</td>\n<td>Extended Family</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1 in 25</td>\n<td>Extended Family</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>1 in 40</td>\n<td>Extended Family</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>1 in 60</td>\n<td>Hamlet</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>1 in 165</td>\n<td>Hamlet</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>1 in 400</td>\n<td>Small barony</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>1 in 900</td>\n<td>Barony or village</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>1 in 2,100</td>\n<td>Small viscounty</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>1 in 5,000</td>\n<td>Viscounty</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>1 in 15,000</td>\n<td>Small Jarldom</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>1 in 40,000</td>\n<td>Jarldom</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>1 in 115,000</td>\n<td>Small Barbarian Kingdom</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>1 in 265,000</td>\n<td>Barbarian Kingdom</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>1 in 550,000</td>\n<td>Barbarian High Kingdom</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>Civilized human realms have the lowest proportion of leveled characters. The crushing reality of agricultural economics leaves only a small elite available to study war, magic, and theology. Only 1 in 40 inhabitants of, e.g., the Auran Empire is 1st level. There are only 2 adults per 5 inhabitants, so 1 in 16 (6.25%) of human adults is 1st level.</p>\n<p>Demi-human realms have a higher proportion of leveled characters. Demi-humans have longer lifespans than humans, which offers more opportunity for members of their races to gain levels. They also face more frequent incursions from beastmen raiders. Therefore, 1 in 20 inhabitants of a typical elven fastness or dwarven vault, or 1 in 8 adults (12.5%) of demi-human adults is 1st level.</p>\n<p>Clanholds and nomad hordes, of the sort found in Ulruk, Jutland, and Skysostan, have the highest proportion of leveled characters. 1 in 15 inhabitants, or 1 in 6 adults (16.7%) of tribal and nomad realms are 1st level. Fortunately for the inhabitants of civilized realms, clanholds and nomad hordes tend to have much lower population densities, so the higher frequency of leveled characters does not necessarily overwhelm the number in civilized realms.</p>\n<p>We strongly encourage you to use these demographics to guide the number of leveled NPCs you place in your <em>ACKS</em> campaigns. Everything from the personal authority of leaders, the GP thresholds for campaign XP, and the expected wealth of characters by level is attuned to these demographics.</p>\n<p>That said, the Demographics of Leveled Characters should not be treated like a straitjacket on your creativity. If your campaign calls for a demographically-unlikely number of powerful mages in a particular city, so be it. Just be aware of the implications!</p>\n"

Moreover, lieutenants become progressively scarcer for larger units, which nicely reflects the real-world difficulty of finding competent people capable of managing large bodies of troops.

      "html": "<p>Using the XP thresholds and the mathematics for earning XP from campaign activities, we can calculate the minimum age of various NPCs if they have not undertaken adventuring or other high-risk activities. Note that these are minimums – they assume that at every step, the NPC has the resources necessary to advance. If those resources are not available, the increase in XP threshold by level will ensure they do not make progress. For instance, a tribune will never advance from 5th level, no matter how old he gets, if his domain income remains below his XP threshold.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fighter/Other (noble)</strong> includes aristocrats, nobles, and patricians with opportunities for command and rulership from a young age, either from inherited lands or a ladder of offices such as the <em>cursus honorum</em>. They accumulate XP from their rule and advance relatively quickly (though not so quickly as adventurers!). Around 7th level, they hit middle age.</li>\n<li><strong>Fighter/Other (magistrate)</strong> represents the armigers, knights, serjeants, stewards, and other retainers of the nobility, who work as magistrates in their domains. They accumulate XP from the fee paid for their magistrature. Because they do not directly rule domains, they advance much slower. It would not be uncommon for a 40-year old 9th level prefect to have a 56-year old guard captain or steward of 7th level. Magistrates with ambitions for swifter progress often seek to become domain rulers themselves, usually at the expense of their ostensible lords.</li>\n<li><strong>Fighter/Other (commoner/enlisted)</strong> represents the path of common enlisted troops of the realm. They are assumed to fight no more than one major battle every other year, gaining battle and spoils XP in each battle. Veteran troops (1st level characters) will generally be the survivors of 5-7 battles over 15 years. Across all troops, the average age of active-duty troops is 28, the average age of veteran soldiers is 36, and the average age of retired soldiers is 50.</li>\n<li><strong>Crusader (proselytizer)</strong> encompasses all those divine spellcasters who peacefully advance in level by means of acquiring divine power from congregants and returning it to their patron deity. This a slow process, as the faithful are few in number. Crusaders, priestesses, and shamans who have advanced by proselytization will be almost 70 years old by the time they reach 11th level. Note that divine power alone is not sufficient to enable a crusader to reach 14th level; for this he must be a theocratic ruler!</li>\n<li><strong>Mage (researcher)</strong> includes those arcane spellcasters who peacefully advance in level through magical research. At lower levels they work as assistants for more advanced colleagues, while at higher levels they pursue their own projects. If a mage is fortunate enough to have a steady supply of gold and special components, advancement can be relatively swift.

This helps explain both why adventurers are often called on to quests by various patrons, as well as why adventurers can, when ready, claim crowns and take thrones.</p>\n<p><strong>Designer’s Note:</strong> Because of their unpleasant complexity, we have excluded the comprehensive workbooks that were used to calculate these numbers.

      "html": "<p>One of the common questions that every <em>ACKS</em> Judge faces is deciding how much high-level help a ruler can call on. Does a 9th level duke have a mage on his payroll? What level is the chief priest of a principality ruled by a 12th level mage? To solve this problem, we first made some simplifying assumptions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Every ruler pays himself a wage equal to his henchman salary. He uses this wage for rent, food, drink, ordinary servants, pets, and so on.</li>\n<li>Every ruler allocates an amount of treasure equal to the supply cost needed to field his own fighting forces. During campaign months, these funds are used for supply troops; during other months, they might be spent on agricultural investments or stronghold construction.</li>\n<li>The amount of treasure available to hire an entourage of supporters is therefore equal to Domain Income – (Ruler Salary + Supply Cost).</li>\n<li>In addition, every ruler pays 1gp per family per month in tithes towards the local ecclesiastics. While not directly under the control of the ruler, these crusaders tend to be cooperative with and supportive of a ruler who pays his tithes and upholds the law. The amount of treasure spent on maintaining clergy is equal to the tithes paid.</li>\n<li>If desired, “non-cleric” funds can be spent on clerics, but not vice versa.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Since we know the number of rulers of each level, their average domain income, their salaries by level, and their domain tithes, we can work out the gp value of entourages. Note that is the maximumentourage of an averageruler. Because salary changes with level, rulers with the same title who pay themselves a higher salary will have smaller entourages and vice versa.

The specific entourage of any given NPC should be chosen by you with reference to the Demographics of Leveled Characters in your setting.</p>\n<p>Members of a ruler’s entourage might be followers or henchmen, or might be non-henchmen mercenaries retained for pay. If the latter, they will have the loyalty of Mercenary Commanders or Non-Henchmen Vassals depending on their relationship and treatment (Judge’s discretion). Since henchmen slots are limited and followers are only available at high level, most rulers are forced to choose between having untrustworthy people in their entourage or having untrustworthy people managing their sub-domains.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: The adventurers are attacking Aura to claim the throne, where they will face the usurper Tarkaun Drakomir. Drakomir is a 14th level fighter. As an emperor, he can call on a maximum of 1 divine spellcasters of 12th, 11th, and 10th level, and 2 9th level divine casters. He can call on 2 other NPCs of 13th, 12th, and 11th level, 3 of 10th level, and 6 of 9th level. The Judge decides the emperor’s entourage is as follows:</p>\n<p>Regent of the Tower of Knowledge: 1 x 13th level mage</p>\n<p>Prefect of the Emperor’s Talons: 1 x 13th level fighter</p>\n<p>Grand Patriarch of the Temple of the Winged Sun: 1 x 12th level crusader</p>\n<p>Master of Spies: 1 x 12th level thief</p>\n<p>Master of Coin: 1 x 12th level venturer</p>\n<p>Matriarch of the Keepers of the Hearth Fire: 1 x 11th level priestess</p>\n<p>Blade-Mistress of the Temple of the Blade and Veil: 1 x 10th level bladedancer</p>\n<p>Patriarchs of the Temple of the Winged Sun: 2 x 9th level crusaders</p>\n<p>Officers of the Emperor’s Talons: 3 x 10th level fighters, 2 x 9th level assassins, 2 x 9th level bards, 2 x 9th level fighters</p>\n<p>The emperor has CHA 13 and Leadership proficiency, enabling him to have 6 henchmen. As Tarkaun of Aura, he has five vassals: the exarchs of Krysea, Nicea, Opelenea, Southern Argollë, and Tirenea. The Judge decides that the exarchs of Krysea, Nicea, and Southern Argollë are henchmen, while those of Opelenea and Tirenea are non-henchman vassals. That leaves the emperor with 3 henchmen available. The Judge decides that the Prefect of the Emperor’s Talons, the Master of Spies, and the Master of Coin are his henchmen. The other members of the entourage are non-henchmen and thus less loyal.</p>\n"

  "rawMarkdown": "## Demographics of Leveled NPCs\n\nThe vast majority of NPCs are 0th level characters. A small minority are leveled characters of 1st level and above. Levelled characters become increasingly rare with each level after 1st. The exact frequency at which leveled characters appear in a population depends on the nature of the civilization to which the population belongs. The Demographics of Leveled NPCs tables, below, show the frequencies at which leveled characters occur for civilized human realms, demi-human realms, and barbarian realms.\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Demographics of Leveled NPCs in Human Realm** | | |\n| **Level** | **Frequency** | **Possible Realm** |\n| 1 | 1 in 40 | Extended Family |\n| 2 | 1 in 100 | Tiny hamlet |\n| 3 | 1 in 285 | Small barony or hamlet |\n| 4 | 1 in 780 | Barony or village |\n| 5 | 1 in 2,150 | Small viscounty or large village |\n| 6 | 1 in 5,900 | Viscounty or large town |\n| 7 | 1 in 16,225 | Small county or small city |\n| 8 | 1 in 45,000 | County or large city |\n| 9 | 1 in 111,500 | Small duchy or large city |\n| 10 | 1 in 280,000 | Duchy or metropolis |\n| 11 | 1 in 627,000 | Principality or huge metropolis |\n| 12 | 1 in 1,725,000 | Large principality or small kingdom |\n| 13 | 1 in 4,750,000 | Kingdom |\n| 14 | 1 in 13,000,000 | Empire |\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Demographics of Leveled NPCs in Demi-human Realm** | | |\n| **Level** | **Frequency** | **Possible Realm** |\n| 1 | 1 in 20 | Extended Family |\n| 2 | 1 in 50 | Hamlet |\n| 3 | 1 in 150 | Small barony |\n| 4 | 1 in 375 | Barony or village |\n| 5 | 1 in 1,000 | Small viscounty or large village |\n| 6 | 1 in 3,000 | Viscounty or large town |\n| 7 | 1 in 8,000 | County or city |\n| 8 | 1 in 20,000 | Large county or city |\n| 9 | 1 in 60,000 | Duchy or large city |\n| 10 | 1 in 160,000 | Small principality or metropolis |\n| 11 | 1 in 450,000 | Principality |\n| 12 | 1 in 1,200,000 | Small kingdom |\n| 13 | 1 in 3,250,000 | Kingdom |\n| 14 | 1 in 10,000,000 | Empire |\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Demographics of Leveled NPC in Barbarian Clanhold** | | |\n| **Level** | **Frequency** | **Possible Realm** |\n| 1 | 1 in 15 | Extended Family |\n| 2 | 1 in 25 | Extended Family |\n| 3 | 1 in 40 | Extended Family |\n| 4 | 1 in 60 | Hamlet |\n| 5 | 1 in 165 | Hamlet |\n| 6 | 1 in 400 | Small barony |\n| 7 | 1 in 900 | Barony or village |\n| 8 | 1 in 2,100 | Small viscounty |\n| 9 | 1 in 5,000 | Viscounty |\n| 10 | 1 in 15,000 | Small Jarldom |\n| 11 | 1 in 40,000 | Jarldom |\n| 12 | 1 in 115,000 | Small Barbarian Kingdom |\n| 13 | 1 in 265,000 | Barbarian Kingdom |\n| 14 | 1 in 550,000 | Barbarian High Kingdom |\n\nCivilized human realms have the lowest proportion of leveled characters. The crushing reality of agricultural economics leaves only a small elite available to study war, magic, and theology. Only 1 in 40 inhabitants of, e.g., the Auran Empire is 1st level. There are only 2 adults per 5 inhabitants, so 1 in 16 (6.25%) of human adults is 1st level.\n\nDemi-human realms have a higher proportion of leveled characters. Demi-humans have longer lifespans than humans, which offers more opportunity for members of their races to gain levels. They also face more frequent incursions from beastmen raiders. Therefore, 1 in 20 inhabitants of a typical elven fastness or dwarven vault, or 1 in 8 adults (12.5%) of demi-human adults is 1st level.\n\nClanholds and nomad hordes, of the sort found in Ulruk, Jutland, and Skysostan, have the highest proportion of leveled characters. 1 in 15 inhabitants, or 1 in 6 adults (16.7%) of tribal and nomad realms are 1st level. Fortunately for the inhabitants of civilized realms, clanholds and nomad hordes tend to have much lower population densities, so the higher frequency of leveled characters does not necessarily overwhelm the number in civilized realms.\n\nWe strongly encourage you to use these demographics to guide the number of leveled NPCs you place in your *ACKS* campaigns. Everything from the personal authority of leaders, the GP thresholds for campaign XP, and the expected wealth of characters by level is attuned to these demographics.\n\nThat said, the Demographics of Leveled Characters should not be treated like a straitjacket on your creativity. If your campaign calls for a demographically-unlikely number of powerful mages in a particular city, so be it. Just be aware of the implications!\n\n### Leveled NPCs of Aurëpos\n\nThe table below provides the frequency by class and level of leveled characters within the population of Aurëpos, home of the Auran Empire. Aurëpos has a population of 66,067,940 people. You can adapt these values to your own campaign by simply multiplying the number appearing by the population of your continent or region divided by the population of Aurëpos.\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Character**  **Level** | **% of Population** | **## of**  **Characters** | **Fighters/Explorers**  **(~ 40%)** | **Crusaders**  **(~ 20%)** | **Thieves**  **(~ 20%)** | **Mage**  **(~ 10%)** | **Venturers**  **(~ 10%)** |\n| 1st | 2.666382% | 1,761,624 | 704,650 | 352,325 | 352,325 | 176,162 | 176,162 |\n| 2nd | 0.969594% | 640,590 | 256,236 | 128,118 | 128,118 | 64,059 | 64,059 |\n| 3rd | 0.352579% | 232,942 | 93,177 | 46,588 | 46,588 | 23,294 | 23,294 |\n| 4th | 0.128211% | 84,706 | 33,882 | 16,941 | 16,941 | 8,471 | 8,471 |\n| 5th | 0.046622% | 30,802 | 10,011 | 6,160 | 6,160 | 5,390 | 3,080 |\n| 6th | 0.016953% | 11,201 | 3,920 | 2,240 | 2,240 | 1,680 | 1,120 |\n| 7th | 0.006165% | 4,073 | 1,426 | 815 | 815 | 611 | 407 |\n| 8th | 0.002242% | 1,481 | 518 | 296 | 296 | 222 | 148 |\n| 9th | 0.000897% | 592 | 207 | 118 | 118 | 89 | 59 |\n| 10th | 0.000359% | 237 | 59 | 47 | 47 | 59 | 24 |\n| 11th | 0.000159% | 105 | 26 | 21 | 21 | 26 | 11 |\n| 12th | 0.000058% | 38 | 10 | 8 | 8 | 10 | 4 |\n| 13th | 0.000021% | 14 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 1 |\n| 14th | 0.000008% | 5 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |\n\n### NPC Rulers of Aurëpos\n\nThis table presents the number of rulers of each title; the average families governed by each title of ruler; the average income per month of each title of ruler; the average tithe paid of each title of ruler; and the average garrison expenditure per month of each title of ruler in Aurëpos. The average garrison is then multiplied by the number of rulers to determine the total garrison of all Aurëpos. We assume that the average troop earns 25gp. These metrics feed into ruler entourages (p. XX)\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Ruler**  **Title** | **No. of**  **Rulers** | **Average**  **Families** | **Average**  **Income** | **Average**  **Tithe** | **Average**  **Garrison Cost** | **Total**  **Garrison Cost** |\n| Emperor | 1 | 112,500 | 911,172 | 112,500 | 225,000 | 225,000 |\n| King | 11 | 34,156 | 214,294 | 34,156 | 78,820 | 867,020 |\n| Prince | 47 | 12,771 | 88,414 | 12,771 | 30,954 | 1,454,834 |\n| Duke | 224 | 2,583 | 22,655 | 2,583 | 6,726 | 1,499,934 |\n| Count | 1,178 | 963 | 8,444 | 963 | 2,433 | 2,866,157 |\n| Viscounty | 6,324 | 346 | 2,831 | 346 | 859 | 5,435,411 |\n| Baron | 32,665 | 154 | 656 | 154 | 332 | 10,836,453 |\n| **Total of Total:** | | | | | | 23,184,809 |\n| **Total No. of Troops:** | | | | | | 927,392 |\n\nThe following table shows the level of experience of the rulers of each title. Note that the levels of rulers are skewed towards the higher level range for each title, because rulers tend to accumulate XP (income – GP threshold) until they stop leveling. Some of the rulers will have advanced to a higher level and be actively seeking to expand their domains in order to advance in power.\n\nYou can adapt these values to your own campaign by simply multiplying the number appearing by the population of your continent or region divided by the population of Aurëpos.\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Ruler Title** | **14th** | **13th** | **12th** | **11th** | **10th** | **9th** | **8th** | **7th** | **6th** | **5th** | **4th** | **3rd** |\n| Emperor | 1 | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - |\n| King | 2 | 9 | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - |\n| Prince | - | - | 35 | 12 | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - |\n| Duke | - | - | - | - | 186 | 37 | - | - | - | - | - | - |\n| Count | - | - | - | - | - | - | 896 | 282 | - | - | - | - |\n| Viscounty | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | 4,684 | 1,640 | - | - |\n| Baron | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | 23,951 | 8,709 |\n\n### NPC Military Commanders of Aurëpos\n\nKnowing the total number of troops in Aurëpos (927,392) allows us to work out the number of brigades, battalions, companies, and platoons that exist on the continent. We assume troops are 80% infantry and 20% cavalry, and that they are organized into units of the sizes presented in ***ACKS II******Revised Rulebook***and ***Domains at War***. Each commander is assumed to be able to command 4 units, although in practice many commanders can control many more than that. Each lieutenant can lead 1 unit.\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  | **Realm**  **Troops** | **Infantry**  **Only** | **Cavalry**  **Only** | **Total**  **Units** | **Commanders**  **Required** | **Lieutenants**  **Required** |\n|  |  | 927,392 | 741,914 | 185,478 | -- | -- | - |\n| Number of Brigades | | | 386 | 193 | 580 | 145 | 580 |\n| Number of Battalions | | | 1,546 | 773 | 2,318 | 580 | 2,318 |\n| Number of Companies | | | 6,183 | 3,091 | 9,274 | 2,318 | 9,274 |\n| Number of Platoons | | | 24,730 | 12,365 | 37,096 | 9,274 | 37,096 |\n\nThese numbers are then used to calculate the available leaders for the troops of the realm. The table below shows the number of commanders required to command the units; the number of NPCs eligible to hold those commands; the number of lieutenants required to lead the units; and the number of NPCs eligible to hold those lieutenancies; and the percentage of the requirement that can be met.\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Unit**  **Size** | **Infantry**  **Only** | **Cavalry**  **Only** | **Total**  **Units** | **Cmdrs.**  **Required** | **Cmdrs.**  **Level Require.** | **Eligible**  **Cmdrs.** |  | **Excess**  **Cmdrs.** | **Lieut.**  **Required** | **Lieut.**  **Level Req.** | **Eligible**  **Lieut.** | **Lieut.**  **%%** |\n| Brigades | 386 | 193 | 580 | 145 | 10 | 245 |  | 100 | 580 | 9 | 137 | 24% |\n| Battalions | 1,546 | 773 | 2,318 | 580 | 8 | 933 |  | 353 | 2,318 | 7 | 635 | 28% |\n| Companies | 6,183 | 3,091 | 9,274 | 2,318 | 6 | 4,976 |  | 2,658 | 9,274 | 5 | 4,298 | 46% |\n| Platoons | 24,730 | 12,365 | 37,096 | 9,274 | 4 | 25,591 |  | 16,317 | 37,096 | 3 | 25,026 | 67% |\n\nYou can use these metrics as benchmarks when developing and staffing the armies that guard – or threaten – your campaign’s realms. The most important fact to note is that, while there are sufficient commanders available to lead the armies of Aurëpos, there are not enough lieutenants available to staff every unit: a typical realm will simply not have a lieutenant available for every unit of each size. Moreover, lieutenants become progressively scarcer for larger units, which nicely reflects the real-world difficulty of finding competent people capable of managing large bodies of troops. In a company-sized battle, fewer than half (46%) of the units will have lieutenants, and in a huge brigade-scale battle, less than a quarter (24%) will.\n\n### Age of Leveled NPCs\n\nUsing the XP thresholds and the mathematics for earning XP from campaign activities, we can calculate the minimum age of various NPCs if they have not undertaken adventuring or other high-risk activities. Note that these are minimums – they assume that at every step, the NPC has the resources necessary to advance. If those resources are not available, the increase in XP threshold by level will ensure they do not make progress. For instance, a tribune will never advance from 5th level, no matter how old he gets, if his domain income remains below his XP threshold.\n\n* **Fighter/Other (noble)** includes aristocrats, nobles, and patricians with opportunities for command and rulership from a young age, either from inherited lands or a ladder of offices such as the *cursus honorum*. They accumulate XP from their rule and advance relatively quickly (though not so quickly as adventurers!). Around 7th level, they hit middle age.\n* **Fighter/Other (magistrate)** represents the armigers, knights, serjeants, stewards, and other retainers of the nobility, who work as magistrates in their domains. They accumulate XP from the fee paid for their magistrature. Because they do not directly rule domains, they advance much slower. It would not be uncommon for a 40-year old 9th level prefect to have a 56-year old guard captain or steward of 7th level. Magistrates with ambitions for swifter progress often seek to become domain rulers themselves, usually at the expense of their ostensible lords.\n* **Fighter/Other (commoner/enlisted)** represents the path of common enlisted troops of the realm. They are assumed to fight no more than one major battle every other year, gaining battle and spoils XP in each battle. Veteran troops (1st level characters) will generally be the survivors of 5-7 battles over 15 years. Across all troops, the average age of active-duty troops is 28, the average age of veteran soldiers is 36, and the average age of retired soldiers is 50.\n* **Crusader (proselytizer)** encompasses all those divine spellcasters who peacefully advance in level by means of acquiring divine power from congregants and returning it to their patron deity. This a slow process, as the faithful are few in number. Crusaders, priestesses, and shamans who have advanced by proselytization will be almost 70 years old by the time they reach 11th level. Note that divine power alone is not sufficient to enable a crusader to reach 14th level; for this he must be a theocratic ruler!\n* **Mage (researcher)** includes those arcane spellcasters who peacefully advance in level through magical research. At lower levels they work as assistants for more advanced colleagues, while at higher levels they pursue their own projects. If a mage is fortunate enough to have a steady supply of gold and special components, advancement can be relatively swift. In many cases, however, mages lack the resources they need to advance.\n* **Thief (carouser)** represents the thieves, assassins, bards, and other streetwise types. They are assumed to advance in level by perpetrating petty hijinks such as carousing. As a result, they advance quite slowly. A 3rd level thief will already be middle aged and virtually none will advance past 5th level unless they become willing to take big risks, such as adventuring or dangerous hijinks.\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **NPC Level** | **Fighter/Other**  **(noble)** | **Fighter/Other (magistrate)** | **Fighter/Other (commoner/enlisted)** | **Crusader (proselytizer)** | **Mage (researcher)** | **Thief (carouser)** |\n| 0 | 18 | 18 | 18 | 18 | 18 | 18 |\n| 1 | 20 | 20 | 33 | 25 | 20 | 29 |\n| 2 | 25 | 27 | 44 M | 28 | 21 | 36 M |\n| 3 | 30 | 31 | 55+ O | 30 | 23 | 40 |\n| 4 | 32 | 33 | - | 33 | 25 | 43 |\n| 5 | 33 | 44 M | - | 36 M | 26 | 44+ |\n| 6 | 34 | 51 | - | 38 | 28 | - |\n| 7 | 35M | 56 O | - | 46 | 30 | - |\n| 8 | 38 | 58 | - | 49 | 31 | - |\n| 9 | 40 | 61 | - | 49 | 33 | - |\n| 10 | 41 | 62 | - | 50 | 35 M | - |\n| 11 | 41 | 63+ | - | 69 O | 36 | - |\n| 12 | 41 | - | - | 70 | 38 | - |\n| 13 | 42 | - | - | 70 | 41 | - |\n| 14 | 43+ | - | - | - | 43+ | - |\n\nWhat should be clear to you from these tables is that the vast majority of mid- to high-level NPCs in the world are middle aged or old. As such they will have already lost at least 2 points of STR, DEX, and CON, making them (relatively) weaker than comparable PCs of the same level who have advanced quicker. This helps explain both why adventurers are often called on to quests by various patrons, as well as why adventurers can, when ready, claim crowns and take thrones.\n\n**Designer’s Note:** Because of their unpleasant complexity, we have excluded the comprehensive workbooks that were used to calculate these numbers. If you are interested in learning more about the demographic calculations of *ACKS*,you can gain access to additional information and (at some tiers) workbooks detailing the calculations on the Autarch Patreon.\n\n### Wealth and Magic Item Availability by NPC Level\n\nHow much wealth does a typical NPC have? How many magic items? The table below shows the expected wealth and the number of magic items of each category (common, uncommon, rare, very rare, and legendary) a typical NPC of each level will have access to.\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **NPC**  **Level** | **Wealth**  **Per NPC** | **Magic Item**  **Value Per NPC** | **Common**  **(500gp)** | **Uncommon**  **(2,500gp)** | **Rare**  **(12,500gp)** | **Very Rare**  **(60,000gp)** | **Legendary**  **(300,000gp)** |\n| **0** | 70 gp | 4.2036 gp | 1% | - | - | - | - |\n| **1** | 770 gp | 150 gp | 30% | - | - | - | - |\n| **2** | 2,310 gp | 450 gp | 90% | - | - | - | - |\n| **3** | 4,620 gp | 875 gp | 1 | 15% | - | - | - |\n| **4** | 9,240 gp | 1,750 gp | 1.5 | .40% | - | - | - |\n| **5** | 19,200 gp | 3,500 gp | 2 | 1 | - | - | - |\n| **6** | 38,640 gp | 7,000 gp | 4 | 2 | - | - | - |\n| **7** | 76,800 gp | 15,250 gp | 4 | 2 | 66% | - | - |\n| **8** | 153,600 gp | 28,500 gp | 5 | 3 | 1 | 10% | - |\n| **9** | 346,244 gp | 65,000 gp | 5 | 3 | 2 | 50% | - |\n| **10** | 505,533 gp | 97,500 gp | 5 | 5 | 3 | 75% | - |\n| **11** | 1,139,969 gp | 228,500 gp | 7 | 7 | 7 | 2 | - |\n| **12** | 1,774,405 gp | 349,000 gp | 8 | 7 | 7 | 4 | - |\n| **13** | 4,538,039 gp | 892,500 gp | 10 | 10 | 9 | 5 | 1.5 |\n| **14** | 12,982,800 gp | 2,555,000 gp | 10 | 10 | 10 | 10 | 6 |\n\nAs always, these are just guideline and you do not need to strictly adhere to them when developing your NPCs. For instance, if your campaign entails that a 1st level halfling owns a legendary magic item, so be it (that might make a suitable basis for a great campaign!). However, in most cases, those who are most powerful will have the most powerful magic items.\n\n### Entourages of Leveled Character\n\nOne of the common questions that every *ACKS* Judge faces is deciding how much high-level help a ruler can call on. Does a 9th level duke have a mage on his payroll? What level is the chief priest of a principality ruled by a 12th level mage? To solve this problem, we first made some simplifying assumptions:\n\n* Every ruler pays himself a wage equal to his henchman salary. He uses this wage for rent, food, drink, ordinary servants, pets, and so on.\n* Every ruler allocates an amount of treasure equal to the supply cost needed to field his own fighting forces. During campaign months, these funds are used for supply troops; during other months, they might be spent on agricultural investments or stronghold construction.\n* The amount of treasure available to hire an entourage of supporters is therefore equal to Domain Income – (Ruler Salary + Supply Cost).\n* In addition, every ruler pays 1gp per family per month in tithes towards the local ecclesiastics. While not directly under the control of the ruler, these crusaders tend to be cooperative with and supportive of a ruler who pays his tithes and upholds the law. The amount of treasure spent on maintaining clergy is equal to the tithes paid.\n* If desired, “non-cleric” funds can be spent on clerics, but not vice versa.\n\nSince we know the number of rulers of each level, their average domain income, their salaries by level, and their domain tithes, we can work out the gp value of entourages. Note that is the maximumentourage of an averageruler. Because salary changes with level, rulers with the same title who pay themselves a higher salary will have smaller entourages and vice versa. Each ruler would, of course, choose for himself.\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Ruler**  **Level** | **Ruler**  **Title** | **Domain**  **Income** | **Ruler**  **Salary** | **Supply**  **Cost** | **Domain**  **Tithe** | **Entourage**  **(Non-Clerical)** | **Entourage**  **(Clerical)** |\n| **3** | Baron | 656 | 100 | 73 | 157 | 483 | 157 |\n| **4** | Baron | 656 | 200 | 73 | 157 | 383 | 157 |\n| **5** | Viscount | 2,831 | 400 | 189 | 351 | 2,242 | 351 |\n| **6** | Viscount | 2,831 | 800 | 189 | 351 | 1,842 | 351 |\n| **7** | Count | 8,444 | 1,600 | 535 | 982 | 6,309 | 982 |\n| **8** | Count | 8,444 | 3,000 | 535 | 982 | 4,909 | 982 |\n| **9** | Duke | 22,655 | 7,250 | 1,480 | 2,658 | 13,925 | 2,658 |\n| **10** | Duke | 22,655 | 12,000 | 1,480 | 2,658 | 9,175 | 2,658 |\n| **11** | Prince | 88,414 | 32,000 | 6,810 | 13,065 | 49,604 | 13,065 |\n| **12** | Prince | 88,414 | 50,000 | 6,810 | 13,065 | 31,604 | 13,065 |\n| **13 + 14** | King | 214,294 | 135,000 | 17,340 | 34,156 | 61,954 | 34,156 |\n| **14** | Emperor | 911,172 | 350,000 | 49,500 | 112,500 | 511,672 | 112,500 |\n\nBelow are sample entourages showing how funds could be spent. The specific entourage of any given NPC should be chosen by you with reference to the Demographics of Leveled Characters in your setting.\n\nMembers of a ruler’s entourage might be followers or henchmen, or might be non-henchmen mercenaries retained for pay. If the latter, they will have the loyalty of Mercenary Commanders or Non-Henchmen Vassals depending on their relationship and treatment (Judge’s discretion). Since henchmen slots are limited and followers are only available at high level, most rulers are forced to choose between having untrustworthy people in their entourage or having untrustworthy people managing their sub-domains.\n\nEXAMPLE: The adventurers are attacking Aura to claim the throne, where they will face the usurper Tarkaun Drakomir. Drakomir is a 14th level fighter. As an emperor, he can call on a maximum of 1 divine spellcasters of 12th, 11th, and 10th level, and 2 9th level divine casters. He can call on 2 other NPCs of 13th, 12th, and 11th level, 3 of 10th level, and 6 of 9th level. The Judge decides the emperor’s entourage is as follows:\n\nRegent of the Tower of Knowledge: 1 x 13th level mage\n\nPrefect of the Emperor’s Talons: 1 x 13th level fighter\n\nGrand Patriarch of the Temple of the Winged Sun: 1 x 12th level crusader\n\nMaster of Spies: 1 x 12th level thief\n\nMaster of Coin: 1 x 12th level venturer\n\nMatriarch of the Keepers of the Hearth Fire: 1 x 11th level priestess\n\nBlade-Mistress of the Temple of the Blade and Veil: 1 x 10th level bladedancer\n\nPatriarchs of the Temple of the Winged Sun: 2 x 9th level crusaders\n\nOfficers of the Emperor’s Talons: 3 x 10th level fighters, 2 x 9th level assassins, 2 x 9th level bards, 2 x 9th level fighters\n\nThe emperor has CHA 13 and Leadership proficiency, enabling him to have 6 henchmen. As Tarkaun of Aura, he has five vassals: the exarchs of Krysea, Nicea, Opelenea, Southern Argollë, and Tirenea. The Judge decides that the exarchs of Krysea, Nicea, and Southern Argollë are henchmen, while those of Opelenea and Tirenea are non-henchman vassals. That leaves the emperor with 3 henchmen available. The Judge decides that the Prefect of the Emperor’s Talons, the Master of Spies, and the Master of Coin are his henchmen. The other members of the entourage are non-henchmen and thus less loyal.\n\n###### Emperor’s Sample Entourage\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Character**  **Level** | **Salary**  **Required** | **No. of**  **Divine** | **Total**  **Salary** | **No. of**  **Non-Divine** | **Total**  **Salary** |\n| 13 | 135,000 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 270,000 |\n| 12 | 50,000 | 1 | 50,000 | 2 | 100,000 |\n| 11 | 32,000 | 1 | 32,000 | 2 | 64,000 |\n| 10 | 12,000 | 1 | 12,000 | 3 | 36,000 |\n| 9 | 7,250 | 2 | 14,5000 | 6 | 43,500 |\n| Total: |  |  | 108,500 |  | 513,500 |\n| Max: |  |  | 112,500 |  | 511,672 |\n\n###### King’s Entourage\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Character**  **Level** | **Salary**  **Required** | **No. of**  **Divine** | **Total**  **Salary** | **No. of**  **Non-Divine** | **Total**  **Salary** |\n| 11 | 32,000 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 32,000 |\n| 10 | 12,000 | 1 | 12,000 | 1 | 12,000 |\n| 9 | 7,250 | 2 | 14,500 | 2 | 14,500 |\n| 8 | 3,000 | 3 | 9,000 | 0 | 0 |\n| Total: |  |  | 35,500 |  | 58,500 |\n| Max: |  |  | 34,156 |  | 61,954 |\n\n###### Prince’s Entourage\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Character**  **Level** | **Salary**  **Required** | **No. of**  **Divine** | **Total**  **Salary** | **No. of**  **Non-Divine** | **Total**  **Salary** |\n| 10 | 12,000 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 12,000 |\n| 9 | 7,250 | 1 | 7,250 | 1 | 7,250 |\n| 8 | 3,000 | 1 | 3,000 | 2 | 6,000 |\n| 7 | 1,800 | 2 | 3,600 | 3 | 4,800 |\n| Total: |  |  | 13,850 |  | 30,050 |\n| Max: |  |  | 13,065 |  | 31,604 |\n\n###### Duke’s Entourage\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Character**  **Level** | **Salary**  **Required** | **No. of**  **Divine** | **Total**  **Salary** | **No. of**  **Non-Divine** | **Total**  **Salary** |\n| 8 | 3,000 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 3,000 |\n| 7 | 1,800 | 1 | 1,800 | 2 | 3,200 |\n| 6 | 800 | 1 | 800 | 3 | 2,400 |\n| Total: |  |  | 2,600 |  | 8,600 |\n| Max: |  |  | 2,648 |  | 9,175 |\n\n###### Count’s Entourage\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Character**  **Level** | **Salary**  **Required** | **No. of**  **Divine** | **Total**  **Salary** | **No. of**  **Non-Divine** | **Total**  **Salary** |\n| 7 | 1,600 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1,600 |\n| 6 | 800 | 1 | 800 | 1 | 800 |\n| 5 | 400 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 400 |\n| 4 | 200 | 0 | 0 | 4 | 800 |\n| 3 | 100 | 2 | 200 | 5 | 500 |\n| Total: |  |  | 1,000 |  | 4,100 |\n| Max: |  |  | 1,217 |  | 4,909 |\n\n###### Viscount’s Entourage\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Character**  **Level** | **Salary**  **Required** | **No. of**  **Divine** | **Total**  **Salary** | **No. of**  **Non-Divine** | **Total**  **Salary** |\n| 5 | 400 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 400 |\n| 4 | 200 | 1 | 200 | 2 | 400 |\n| 3 | 100 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 200 |\n| 2 | 50 | 1 | 50 | 5 | 250 |\n| 1 | 25 | 4 | 100 | 14 | 350 |\n| Total: |  |  | 350 |  | 1,600 |\n| Max: |  |  | 351 |  | 1,842 |\n\n###### Baron’s Entourage\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Character**  **Level** | **Salary**  **Required** | **No. of**  **Divine** | **Total**  **Salary** | **No. of**  **Non-Divine** | **Total**  **Salary** |\n| 3 | 100 | 1 | 100 | 2 | 200 |\n| 2 | 50 | 1 | 50 | 2 | 100 |\n| 1 | 25 | 0 | 0 | 3 | 75 |\n| Total: |  |  | 150 |  | 375 |\n| Max: |  |  | 157 |  | 383 |\n"
