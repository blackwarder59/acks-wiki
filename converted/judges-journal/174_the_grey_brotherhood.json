Though his parents encouraged him to pursue an independent path, Andravus enlisted when he came of age. He was soon drummed out of the legion after running afoul of a corrupt centurion.

Cade was largely absent from Avaris’s life for over a decade, but he made sure to divert funds from his adventuring exploits to give him a comfortable childhood. Around the time Avaris became a teenager, his father retired from adventuring and sought him out. Cade began to teach Avaris the tradecraft of the thief. Though Avaris proved skillful in executing hijinks with his father, he aspired to greater deeds. When the Grey Brotherhood was re-established, Avaris saw his chance to prove his worth.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> Avaris is a lean man with narrow eyes and bland appearance, apart from a devilish smile that occasionally flashes when he has pulled off a hijink. He favors non-descript clothes that don’t attract attention.</p>\n<h6>Castinus Acrodynas</h6>\n<p><strong>1st level Venturer</strong> (played by Sean Falconi)</p>\n<p><strong>Stat Line:</strong> AC 2, Spd 30’ / 90’, HP 5, ATK 1 (crossbow 10+ or short sword and dagger 9+), Dmg 1d6, Init +0, ML 0, AL Neutral</p>\n<p><strong>Attributes:</strong> STR 9, INT 9, WIL 9, DEX 10, CON 10, CHA 16</p>\n<p><strong>Saving Throws:</strong> Paralysis 13+, Death 13+, Blast 13+, Implements 14+, Spells 15+</p>\n<p><strong>Class Powers:</strong>  Bribery, Diplomacy, Expert Bargaining, Expert Traveling, Mercantile Network, Multilingual, Pathfinding, Treachery</p>\n<p><strong>Proficiencies:</strong> Adventuring, Alertness, Driving, Navigation</p>\n<p><strong>Languages:</strong> Common, Classical Auran, Elvish, Dwarvish, Goblin</p>\n<p><strong>Equipment:</strong> Crossbow, case with 20 bolts, short sword, 2 throwing daggers, sturdy leather armor, tanned brown cloak, thick tunic and pants, leather belt, high boots, backpack, large treasure sack, 50’ rope, tinderbox, lantern, small hammer, 12 iron spikes, flask of common oil, flask of military oil, waterskin, 1 week’s iron rations, 1gp (enc. 6 3/6 st)</p>\n<p><strong>Background:</strong> Castinus was born into a family of merchants that has done business in the Borderlands for generations – though not always successfully. After incurring disastrous losses in the spice trade, Castinus’ father Paternus founded the original Grey Brotherhood in a desperate attempt to regain his wealth. To Paternus’s surprise, the Grey Brotherhood proved highly profitable. With the plunder earned on over a decade of exploits, Paternus was able to rebuild the family’s trading business into a thriving enterprise. Recently, the family caravan has headed west, to support the legions fighting the Skysos. Castinus has stayed behind in order to re-form his father’s old adventuring company with his childhood friends.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> Castinus maintains high standards of clothing and appearance. His build is average for Auran society, and lean from a lifetime of travel and hustle on the road. Before he became an adventurer, Castinus was a highly social “man about town.” Having nearly died several times, an air of grit and pragmatism has set in him. While still able to negotiate and build financial relationships, he is increasingly looking to violently punish the enemies of law, commerce and the empire.</p>\n<h6>Hyglak Halfhand</h6>\n<p><strong>1st level Fighter</strong> (played by Grant Sinclair)</p>\n<p><strong>Stat Line:</strong> AC 4, Spd 30’ / 90’, HP 6, ATK 1 (great axe 7+ or thrown axe 10+), Dmg 1d10+4 or 1d6+4, Init +0, ML +1, AL Neutral</p>\n<p><strong>Attributes:</strong> STR 18, INT 8, WIL 7, DEX 10, CON 10, CHA 9</p>\n<p><strong>Saving Throws:</strong> Paralysis 14+, Death 15+, Blast 16+, Implements 17+, Spells 18+</p>\n<p><strong>Class Powers:</strong>  Manual of Arms</p>\n<p><strong>Proficiencies:</strong> Adventuring, Berserkergang, Endurance</p>\n<p><strong>Languages:</strong> Common, Juttish</p>\n<p><strong>Equipment:</strong> Great axe, hand axe, chain mail armor, thick wool cloak, wool tunic and pants, leather belt, low boots, belt pouch, small sack, waterskin, 1 week’s iron rations (enc. 6 4/6 st)</p>\n<p><strong>Background:</strong> Hyglak Hergerson is the son of Herger, one of the original Grey Brothers. Following his retirement from the Brotherhood, Herger returned north to his home amongst the Jutland raiders and started a family. Herger trained his children in the Auran arts of war, creating fighters with civilized skill and barbarian courage. Hyglak, the third son, chaffed under his father’s and elder brother’s rule of the family assets and desired to earn his own name. With his father’s blessing, he headed south to join with the sons of his father’s former mercenary company to seek fortune and glory.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> Hyglak is tall and well-muscled with a harsh, chiseled face. He has bright grey eyes almost hidden by an unkempt mane of ruddy brown hair and full beard. In civilized company, his lack of manners is balanced by his love of ale and a good time. In battle, his recklessness is only barely restrained by the discipline of his father’s training. Early on, he earned the name “Halfhand” from his propensity to lose fingers in battle.</p>\n<h6>Raemon Ouras</h6>\n<p><strong>1st level Crusader</strong> (played by Grant Sinclair)</p>\n<p><strong>Stat Line:</strong> AC 7, Spd 20’ / 60’, HP 6, ATK 1 (mace 10+), Dmg 1d6 Init +1, ML +1, AL Lawful</p>\n<p><strong>Attributes:</strong> STR 12, INT 10, WIL 15, DEX 13, CON 13, CHA 16</p>\n<p><strong>Saving Throws:</strong> Paralysis 10+, Death 7+, Blast 13+, Implements 10+, Spells 12+</p>\n<p><strong>Class Powers:</strong>  Divine Magic (1 1st), Rebuke Undead, Theology</p>\n<p><strong>Proficiencies:</strong> Divine Blessing, Theology 2</p>\n<p><strong>Languages:</strong> Common, Classical Auran</p>\n<p><strong>Equipment:</strong> Holy symbol (winged sun of Ammonar), mace, wooden shield, banded plate armor, purple priest’s cassock, embossed belt, high boots, small sack, holy book (The Laws of the Light), waterskin, 1 week’s iron rations, 25sp for alms (8 1/6 st)</p>\n<p><strong>Background:</strong> Raemon the Elder – better known as the Sideral Stallion – was a gregarious bard of Nicean and Opelenean descent who served as the herald of the original Grey Brotherhood. He had hoped his namesake, Raemon the Younger, would follow in his footsteps and become a man of lore and song. Instead, the young Raemon fell under the influence of his uncle, Horatio the Hammer, who had served as a crusader in battles across the Ammas Aurë. To honor his father’s legacy, Raemon has joined the re-established Grey Brotherhood; but he carries with him his uncle’s pious spiritual fire to spread the Empyrean faith and utterly crush evil underfoot.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> Raemon is a tall and imposing man with a handsome face and well-muscled body with dark bronze skin and wavy ebon hair. Those who confront him in his crusader panoply face a veritable wall of iron and sinew.</p>\n<h6>Tirenius Orn</h6>\n<p><strong>1st level Mage</strong> (played by William Macris)</p>\n<p><strong>Stat Line:</strong> AC 0, Spd 40’ / 120’, HP 4, ATK 1 (staff 10+ or dart 10+), Dmg 1d6 or 1d4, Init +0, ML +1, AL Neutral</p>\n<p><strong>Attributes:</strong> STR 9, INT 16, WIL 9, DEX 9, CON 9, CHA 10</p>\n<p><strong>Saving Throws:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Class Powers:</strong>  Arcane Magic (1 1st), Collegiate Wizardry</p>\n<p><strong>Proficiencies:</strong> Elementalism (air), Alchemy 2, Naturalism</p>\n<p><strong>Languages:</strong> Common, Classical Auran</p>\n<p><strong>Spellcasting:</strong> Caster Level 1; Spells per day: 1 1st.</p>\n<p><strong>Spell Repertoire:</strong> 1st – <em>slumber, thunderclap, weave smoke</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Equipment:</strong> Wood-paneled spellbook, gnarled oaken quarterstaff, 5 darts, four-colored cassock with hood, embossed belt, low boots, backpack, quill and ink, waterskin, 1 week’s iron rations, 60gp (enc. 3 1/6 st)</p>\n<p><strong>Background:</strong> The only son of the wizard Zeodan, Tirenius was raised in the Tower of Knowledge in Aura. His costly apprenticeship was easily paid for by the plunder his father earned adventuring with the Grey Brotherhood. Tirenius proved an apt pupil with a predilection for calling on the power of the elemental sphere of air that earned him his robes at a young age. Though invited to stay on as a at the Tower, Tirenius had little desire to spend his life in perpetual study. Instead, he join the re-established Grey Brotherhood.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> Tirenius is a tall, husky man with curly hair and a long, pointed goatee that has gone prematurely grey. While air elementalists have a reputation for being as ever-changing and unpredictable as the wind, Tirenius’s personality is more akin to the darkening sky of a thunder storm – slow to arrive but inexorable and wrathful when it does.</p>\n",

Though explorers are often dour and gruff, Andravus is an affable fellow that wins friends easily.\n\n###### Avaris Mac Cade\n\n**1st level Thief** (played by James Young)\n\n**Stat Line:** AC 3, Spd 20’ / 60’, HP 4, ATK 1 (short bow 9+, Short sword and dagger 9+), Dmg 1d6, Init +1, ML 0, AL Neutral\n\n**Attributes:** STR 11, INT 10, WIL 9, DEX 13, CON 13, CHA 16\n\n**Saving Throws:** Paralysis 13+, Death 13+, Blast 13+, Implements 14+, Spells 15+\n\n**Class Powers:**  Climbing 6+, Hiding 19+, Listening 14+, Lockpicking 18+, Pickpocket 17+, Searching 16+ Sneaking 17+, Trapbreaking 16+\n\n**Proficiencies:** Adventuring, Mapping, Trapfinding\n\n**Languages:** Common, Rornish\n\n**Equipment:** Short bow, quiver with 20 arrows, 10’ pole, short sword, throwing dagger, sturdy leather armor, tanned brown cloak, thick tunic and pants, leather belt, low boots, backpack, 2 large treasure sacks, thieves’ tools, 50’ rope, tinderbox, lantern, small hammer, 12 iron spikes, 2 flasks of common oil, 2 flasks of military oil, wineskin, 1 week’s iron rations, 4gp (enc. 8 st)\n\n**Background:** Avaris’s father, Cade, sired him on a harlot who worked in one of Cyfaraun’s many brothels. Cade was largely absent from Avaris’s life for over a decade, but he made sure to divert funds from his adventuring exploits to give him a comfortable childhood. Around the time Avaris became a teenager, his father retired from adventuring and sought him out. Cade began to teach Avaris the tradecraft of the thief. Though Avaris proved skillful in executing hijinks with his father, he aspired to greater deeds. When the Grey Brotherhood was re-established, Avaris saw his chance to prove his worth.\n\n**Description:** Avaris is a lean man with narrow eyes and bland appearance, apart from a devilish smile that occasionally flashes when he has pulled off a hijink. He favors non-descript clothes that don’t attract attention.\n\n###### Castinus Acrodynas\n\n**1st level Venturer** (played by Sean Falconi)\n\n**Stat Line:** AC 2, Spd 30’ / 90’, HP 5, ATK 1 (crossbow 10+ or short sword and dagger 9+), Dmg 1d6, Init +0, ML 0, AL Neutral\n\n**Attributes:** STR 9, INT 9, WIL 9, DEX 10, CON 10, CHA 16\n\n**Saving Throws:** Paralysis 13+, Death 13+, Blast 13+, Implements 14+, Spells 15+\n\n**Class Powers:**  Bribery, Diplomacy, Expert Bargaining, Expert Traveling, Mercantile Network, Multilingual, Pathfinding, Treachery\n\n**Proficiencies:** Adventuring, Alertness, Driving, Navigation\n\n**Languages:** Common, Classical Auran, Elvish, Dwarvish, Goblin\n\n**Equipment:** Crossbow, case with 20 bolts, short sword, 2 throwing daggers, sturdy leather armor, tanned brown cloak, thick tunic and pants, leather belt, high boots, backpack, large treasure sack, 50’ rope, tinderbox, lantern, small hammer, 12 iron spikes, flask of common oil, flask of military oil, waterskin, 1 week’s iron rations, 1gp (enc. 6 3/6 st)\n\n**Background:** Castinus was born into a family of merchants that has done business in the Borderlands for generations – though not always successfully. After incurring disastrous losses in the spice trade, Castinus’ father Paternus founded the original Grey Brotherhood in a desperate attempt to regain his wealth. To Paternus’s surprise, the Grey Brotherhood proved highly profitable. With the plunder earned on over a decade of exploits, Paternus was able to rebuild the family’s trading business into a thriving enterprise. Recently, the family caravan has headed west, to support the legions fighting the Skysos. Castinus has stayed behind in order to re-form his father’s old adventuring company with his childhood friends.\n\n**Description:** Castinus maintains high standards of clothing and appearance. His build is average for Auran society, and lean from a lifetime of travel and hustle on the road. Before he became an adventurer, Castinus was a highly social “man about town.” Having nearly died several times, an air of grit and pragmatism has set in him. While still able to negotiate and build financial relationships, he is increasingly looking to violently punish the enemies of law, commerce and the empire.\n\n###### Hyglak Halfhand\n\n**1st level Fighter** (played by Grant Sinclair)\n\n**Stat Line:** AC 4, Spd 30’ / 90’, HP 6, ATK 1 (great axe 7+ or thrown axe 10+), Dmg 1d10+4 or 1d6+4, Init +0, ML +1, AL Neutral\n\n**Attributes:** STR 18, INT 8, WIL 7, DEX 10, CON 10, CHA 9\n\n**Saving Throws:** Paralysis 14+, Death 15+, Blast 16+, Implements 17+, Spells 18+\n\n**Class Powers:**  Manual of Arms\n\n**Proficiencies:** Adventuring, Berserkergang, Endurance\n\n**Languages:** Common, Juttish\n\n**Equipment:** Great axe, hand axe, chain mail armor, thick wool cloak, wool tunic and pants, leather belt, low boots, belt pouch, small sack, waterskin, 1 week’s iron rations (enc. 6 4/6 st)\n\n**Background:** Hyglak Hergerson is the son of Herger, one of the original Grey Brothers. Following his retirement from the Brotherhood, Herger returned north to his home amongst the Jutland raiders and started a family. Herger trained his children in the Auran arts of war, creating fighters with civilized skill and barbarian courage. Hyglak, the third son, chaffed under his father’s and elder brother’s rule of the family assets and desired to earn his own name. With his father’s blessing, he headed south to join with the sons of his father’s former mercenary company to seek fortune and glory.\n\n**Description:** Hyglak is tall and well-muscled with a harsh, chiseled face. He has bright grey eyes almost hidden by an unkempt mane of ruddy brown hair and full beard. In civilized company, his lack of manners is balanced by his love of ale and a good time. In battle, his recklessness is only barely restrained by the discipline of his father’s training. Early on, he earned the name “Halfhand” from his propensity to lose fingers in battle.\n\n###### Raemon Ouras\n\n**1st level Crusader** (played by Grant Sinclair)\n\n**Stat Line:** AC 7, Spd 20’ / 60’, HP 6, ATK 1 (mace 10+), Dmg 1d6 Init +1, ML +1, AL Lawful\n\n**Attributes:** STR 12, INT 10, WIL 15, DEX 13, CON 13, CHA 16\n\n**Saving Throws:** Paralysis 10+, Death 7+, Blast 13+, Implements 10+, Spells 12+\n\n**Class Powers:**  Divine Magic (1 1st), Rebuke Undead, Theology\n\n**Proficiencies:** Divine Blessing, Theology 2\n\n**Languages:** Common, Classical Auran\n\n**Equipment:** Holy symbol (winged sun of Ammonar), mace, wooden shield, banded plate armor, purple priest’s cassock, embossed belt, high boots, small sack, holy book (The Laws of the Light), waterskin, 1 week’s iron rations, 25sp for alms (8 1/6 st)\n\n**Background:** Raemon the Elder – better known as the Sideral Stallion – was a gregarious bard of Nicean and Opelenean descent who served as the herald of the original Grey Brotherhood. He had hoped his namesake, Raemon the Younger, would follow in his footsteps and become a man of lore and song. Instead, the young Raemon fell under the influence of his uncle, Horatio the Hammer, who had served as a crusader in battles across the Ammas Aurë. To honor his father’s legacy, Raemon has joined the re-established Grey Brotherhood; but he carries with him his uncle’s pious spiritual fire to spread the Empyrean faith and utterly crush evil underfoot.\n\n**Description:** Raemon is a tall and imposing man with a handsome face and well-muscled body with dark bronze skin and wavy ebon hair. Those who confront him in his crusader panoply face a veritable wall of iron and sinew.\n\n###### Tirenius Orn\n\n**1st level Mage** (played by William Macris)\n\n**Stat Line:** AC 0, Spd 40’ / 120’, HP 4, ATK 1 (staff 10+ or dart 10+), Dmg 1d6 or 1d4, Init +0, ML +1, AL Neutral\n\n**Attributes:** STR 9, INT 16, WIL 9, DEX 9, CON 9, CHA 10\n\n**Saving Throws:**\n\n**Class Powers:**  Arcane Magic (1 1st), Collegiate Wizardry\n\n**Proficiencies:** Elementalism (air), Alchemy 2, Naturalism\n\n**Languages:** Common, Classical Auran\n\n**Spellcasting:** Caster Level 1; Spells per day: 1 1st.\n\n**Spell Repertoire:** 1st – *slumber, thunderclap, weave smoke*.\n\n**Equipment:** Wood-paneled spellbook, gnarled oaken quarterstaff, 5 darts, four-colored cassock with hood, embossed belt, low boots, backpack, quill and ink, waterskin, 1 week’s iron rations, 60gp (enc. 3 1/6 st)\n\n**Background:** The only son of the wizard Zeodan, Tirenius was raised in the Tower of Knowledge in Aura. His costly apprenticeship was easily paid for by the plunder his father earned adventuring with the Grey Brotherhood. Tirenius proved an apt pupil with a predilection for calling on the power of the elemental sphere of air that earned him his robes at a young age. Though invited to stay on as a at the Tower, Tirenius had little desire to spend his life in perpetual study. Instead, he join the re-established Grey Brotherhood.\n\n**Description:** Tirenius is a tall, husky man with curly hair and a long, pointed goatee that has gone prematurely grey. While air elementalists have a reputation for being as ever-changing and unpredictable as the wind, Tirenius’s personality is more akin to the darkening sky of a thunder storm – slow to arrive but inexorable and wrathful when it does.\n"
