Requirements, class category values, hit points per level after 9th, and experience point progressions are modified as noted below. There are no mechanical differences between “high” and “wood” elves, but different classes may be appropriate.\n\n### Requirements\n\nAll elven classes require a minimum Intellect 9 or better.\n\n### Class Category Values\n\n**Fighting:** Elves with narrow or broad weapon selections *must* include at least two bows, crossbows, swords, or daggers among their selections.\n\n**Arcane:** Any build points allocated to the Arcane Value stack with build points allocated to the Elf value for purposes of determining the class’s spellcasting ability (see below).

The XP cost for level 2 is 500 + 1,000 + (625-125) + 2000, for a total of 4,000XP.\n\n### Elf Value\n\nWhen building an elven custom class, assign between 0 and 4 build points to the class’s Elf Value. At Elf 0, all elves gain the following four elven custom powers:\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Value** | **Elf** | **XP Cost** |\n| 4 | Elf + 100% Arcane | 2500 |\n| 3 | Elf + 66% Arcane | 2000 |\n| 2 | Elf + 50% Arcane | 1375 |\n| 1 | Elf + 33% Arcane | 750 |\n| 0 | Elf | 125 |\n\n* **Animal Friendship:** Whenever elves build fastnesses, all ordinary animals within 5 miles of the stronghold become kind and helpful to the elves.\n* **Attunement to Nature:** Elves gain a +1 bonus to surprise rolls when in the wilderness.

Add the two values to find the class’s effective spellcasting abilities. For values of 5 or greater, use the following mechanics:\n\n**Arcane + Elf 5:** The class has the ability to cast spells and engage in magical research as a mage, with the class’s spells per level increased by 33%. The class uses its class level for all level-dependent spell ranges, durations, and damages; these are not increased.\n\n**Arcane + Elf 6:** As above, but the class’s spells per level are increased by 50%.\n\n**Arcane + Elf 7:** As above, but the class’s spells per level are increased by 66%.\n\n**Arcane + Elf 8:** As above, but the class’s spells per level are increased by 100%.\n\nWhen calculating number of spells available, round fractions of 1/2 or more up; round any smaller fractions down.\n\nEXAMPLE: An elven custom class has Arcane 3 and Elf 3. Adding the values together yields 6. The custom class has the spellcasting abilities of a mage with a spell progression with 50% more spells.
