They decide to send the henchmen back in for a second foray to clear the dungeon. The party level is unchanged, as [ (1 + 1 + 2 + 5) / 4 ] = 2. With a dungeon level of 1, their base modifier remains +2. However, the party has been reduced to only four combat-ready henchmen, which removes the party’s +1 modifier for party size.

This Excellent result earns them 150% treasure from this encounter. Only 1d6-5 adventurers suffer mortal wounds; the 1d6 roll is a 4 so no one suffered harm.

Sadly, this is not enough GP to roll for magic items (a level 1 dungeon requires a full 1,000 GP per magic item roll). Because this adventuring party is composed of henchmen, they receive half combat XP, plus XP for the 50% of the gold they get to retain, for a total of (135 + 450) = 585 XP gained (to be divided among them as normal).</p>\n<p>The henchmen return to their employers with loot to divide and stories to tell, with only one in three among them having been maimed by the experience.</p>\n<p>Note that in the example above, the players made all the decisions about their henchman; as always, at your discretion, the henchmen can make their own decisions. The Morale rules (<em><strong>ACKS II</strong></em><em><strong>Revised Rulebook</strong></em>, p. XX) can be used to determine how the henchmen react. Perhaps after seeing two among them maimed the first time they went into a dungeon, they decided that two encounters was enough! If that were the case, they would walk out of the dungeon with only 25% of the running total of treasure, giving them base earnings of 180 XP plus 90 GP. (As henchmen, they would gain only half XP from the combat and keep half of that treasure.) In addition, even if 25% of earned treasure had been sufficient to qualify for a magic item roll, failing to fully clear the dungeon would prevent them from getting to roll.</p>\n<p>Remember also that a henchman receiving a mortal wound usually qualifies as a calamity, and grounds for a loyalty check.
