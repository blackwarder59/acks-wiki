  "html": "<h2>Optional Rules</h2>\n<p>Although the core rules described above will work perfectly fine, a variety of optional rules can assist in bookkeeping, or help you dial in your desired level of complexity and abstraction. Some of these optional rules will decrease complexity, while others will increase it.</p>\n<p>In addition to those rules listed here, any optional rule from Abstract Dungeons can be used in Abstract Wilderness. Though some may not be directly applicable, such as Travel Time to Dungeon, others like Abstract Leveling and Finding Monster Parts can be used without any modification needed.</p>\n<h3>Leading from the Rear</h3>\n<p>Some adventurers may be unwilling to bravely take the fore and charge directly into combat, leading their army behind them. Granted, such a plan is much more likely to get them killed, and so there are some very noticeable benefits to leading from the rear.</p>\n<p>If an adventurer wishes to reduce the chance that they will be injured in combat, they may choose to lead from the rear. An adventurer leading from the rear counts as two levels lower (to a minimum of 0) when calculating expedition level. However, when resolving expedition participants who suffer mortal wounds, an adventurer leading from the rear will not suffer a mortal wound unless all platoon-scale units have suffered one first.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: An expedition has a total of 43 levels of leveled characters and six platoon-scale units. Three of the adventurers leading the expedition choose to lead from the rear, reducing the total effective levels by six, from 43 to 37. This reduces the expedition level from 7 to 6. Later, after a wilderness encounter, a resolution roll indicates that five participants suffer mortal wounds. Because there are five mortal wounds to parcel out and six platoon-scale units, the adventurers who led from the rear are safe. If there had been seven mortal wounds, it would have been possible (if unlikely) for them to suffer one.</p>\n<h3>Multiple Rolls for Multiple Encounters</h3>\n<p>Instead of rolling once to resolve all encounters when multiple encounters are faced, you can instead choose to roll for each individually. When doing so, each roll past the first applies a stacking -1 step penalty to the resolution roll.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: An expedition faces three encounters in a day. The Judge chooses to roll for each individually. The first encounter has no modifier, and is resolved normally. The second modifier has a -1 penalty, in addition to any changes in expedition level and Army Adjustment that may have occurred from the first encounter (as a result of casualties or mortal wounds). The third encounter has a -2 penalty, in addition to any changes that may have occurred as a result of the prior two.</p>\n<p>The average results of either the single roll or multiple rolls are nearly identical, and as a result, it is left to your discretion which to use. The single roll was chosen as the default in order to cut down on complexity and time required to resolve.</p>\n<h3>Situational Modifiers and Adjustments to Wilderness Resolution</h3>\n<p>In addition to the situational modifiers described in Abstract Dungeons, which apply a flat modifier to the resolution roll, situational adjustments can apply difficulty step bonuses or penalties in Abstract Wilderness. Any situational modifier or adjustment is at your discretion.</p>\n<p>For instance, you could roll encounter distance for an encounter; since the majority of wilderness encounters have weak ranged attacks, you might decide to give a bonus to an expedition armed with archers if the encounter is at a very long range. The vast majority of any such situational adjustments or modifiers should be plus or minus one (+/- ±1), but an adjustment or modifier of plus or minus two (+/- ±2) might be applied for extreme situations.</p>\n<h3>Splitting Encounters</h3>\n<p>When an expedition finds a wilderness encounter with a very difficult Challenge Adjustment (-4 or worse), the encounter might qualify to be split up into sub-encounters. This could represent, e.g. a sortie into a sprawling beastman village, where only a fraction of the enemy can confront the adventurers at a time.</p>\n<p>Any encounter with a Challenge Adjustment of -4 or worse has a 75% chance that it can be split into 1d4+1 separate sub-encounters, with a minimum Challenge Adjustment of -2. Should the encounter not divide appropriately, split it into fewer sub-encounters. At your discretion, you can split the encounter up manually based on the context and circumstances.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: An expedition encounters a huge beastman village, a dangerous encounter with a Challenge Adjustment of -7. The Judge decides it can be split up, and rolls 1d4+1 for the number of separate sub-encounters. He rolls a 4. The Challenge Adjustment of -7 cannot be divided by 4 without violating the minimum, so he reduces it to 3 sub-encounters, one with Challenge Adjustment -3 and two with Challenge Adjustment of -2.</p>\n<p>Although an encounter is split up into sub-encounters, all of the sub-encounters are resolved with a single resolution roll. The base resolution adjustment is calculated based on the most difficult Challenge Adjustment of any sub-encounter. Then a penalty of -1 step adjustment is applied per sub-encounter. This penalty is applied as a situational adjustment, after the Army Adjustment and Challenge Adjustment have been accounted for already.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: The expedition now faces three sub-encounters of monster level 3 and Challenge Adjustments -3, -2, and -2. Since -3 is the most difficult Challenge Adjustment, that sets the overall Challenge Adjustment. The expedition level is 9 and the expedition’s modified Army Adjustment is 3. Cross-referencing an expedition level of 9 with a monster level of 3 on the Base Resolution table, the Judge sees that the base difficulty is now Simple (+4). Adding together the Army Adjustment (3) and the Challenge Adjustment (-3) yields 0, so he does not need to shift columns. However, because there are three encounters, the Judge does need to shift the difficulty by 3 steps to the right. Consulting the Base Resolution table, he sees the difficulty is now Dangerous (-2) ; therefore Judge rolls once at a difficulty of Dangerous (-2) to determine the combined results of all three encounters.</p>\n<p>What if the encounter couldn’t be split up? In that case, the base difficulty would still have been Simple (+4) but the Challenge Adjustment would have been -7. After adding the Challenge Adjustment (-7) to the Army Adjustment (+3) to yield -4, he would shift the difficulty by four columns leftward, making it Horrifying (-4).</p>\n<p><strong>Designer’s Note:</strong> Because wilderness encounters cannot be easily categorized by difficulty like dungeon levels, we needed a way to determine how dangerous each encounter would be. This is the purpose of the Challenge Adjustment. The Challenge Adjustment relies on the Abstract Dungeon rules and their generalization of the level of danger. An average dungeon encounter of a given level has a particular XP value, derived by averaging together all such possible encounters. This value is the amount given for Challenge Adjustment 0 as seen in the Treasure and XP section. Since we know generally how dangerous this encounter is, it can be used as the base. Encounters with a higher XPV carry greater danger, and therefore have a Challenge Adjustment, based off of the ratio between the specific encounter’s XPV and the average encounter XPV of that level.</p>\n<p>Unlike in dungeons, in wilderness encounters, parties have a tendency to bring back-up in large amounts. This required a method to calculate the contribution of an army. Battle Rating was the obvious choice. For example, say 90 orc bowmen are encountered. This is 3 platoon-scale units of orc bowmen, a total BR of 4.5. 90 orcs is also 900 XPV, of monster level 1; Challenge Adjustment -5. Thus, it requires 5 BR to negate their Challenge Adjustment, which is close to their own 4.5 BR.</p>\n<p>Consider also a venerable dragon; a level 6 encounter of Challenge Adjustment -1. A venerable dragon has a BR of 38. An expedition that brings along 38 BR of ordinary units must divide their 38 BR by 32 (for the five levels of difference), giving a result of 1.25 which rounds up down to 1, negating the dragon’s Challenge Adjustment.</p>\n<p>It does not always line up perfectly, but the comparison is fairly close, and allows a relatively easy way to calculate their effectiveness. The division for different levels is necessary because the amount of XPV per encounter scales up with level; a level 6 encounter of Challenge Adjustment -1 is much more XPV than a level 1 encounter of Challenge Adjustment -1, and would have a much higher BR.</p>\n",
