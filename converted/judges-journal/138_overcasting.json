  "html": "<h2>Overcasting</h2>\n<p>In some settings, spellcasters can push themselves beyond the ordinary limits of magic, accomplishing more than is normally possible – albeit at great risk. Use these rules if you want magic-users to be more powerful and unpredictable.</p>\n<h3>Overview</h3>\n<p>Casters of Arcane and Divine magic can attempt to Overcast extra spells beyond those they are allotted each day. Each time that a spell is Overcast, however, the player must roll a d20 and consult the Overcasting Success table. Failure results in a fumble. Throwing an unmodified 20 results in an automatic Overcasting Success. Throwing an unmodified 1 is an automatic failure.</p>\n<p>Subsequent attempts to Overcast require successively higher throws to succeed. The Overcasting Success throw is reset each time the caster meets his studious or prayerful requirements.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: A 1st-level mage can normally cast one 1st-level spell per day. If she elects to Overcast a second 1st-level spell on the same day before resting, she fumbles the spell on a throw of 1-5. A third spell cast through Overcasting before resting will result in a fumble on a d20 throw of 1-10.</p>\n<p>A caster cannot Overcast spells of a level to which he does not already have access. However, custom classes built with the alternative spell progression table (who cannot cast spells at 1st level), can Overcast 1st-level spells, even though they do not normally have access to spellcasting until 2nd-level. Doing so is considered the first Overcast of the day and requires an Overcasting Success throw of 6+.</p>\n<p>A caster can choose to spend double the time Overcasting a spell in order to gain a bonus of +2 to the Overcasting Success throw. In most cases, this means taking two rounds to Overcast a spell. The player must indicate that he is taking double the casting time when the casting of the spell is declared. Note that if the character takes damage or fails a saving throw at any time during the Overcast before the spell goes off, the spell is lost. In this case, no success throw is made, but it does count as an attempt.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Overcasting Success</strong></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Attempt of the Day</td>\n<td>Throw</td>\n<td>Throw w/ Double Time</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1st</td>\n<td>6+</td>\n<td>4+</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2nd</td>\n<td>11+</td>\n<td>9+</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3rd</td>\n<td>16+</td>\n<td>14+</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4th</td>\n<td>20+</td>\n<td>18+</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h3>Arcane Calamity</h3>\n<p>When a caster of arcane magic fumbles due to Overcasting, he must roll d% on the Arcane Calamity table. A calamity represents a mistake of some kind. Perhaps the caster mispronounced a magical syllable, or waggled his fingers the wrong way. The caster might also have let his guard down, allowing the extra-planar creature he had bound to his will to gain the upper hand.</p>\n<h3>Divine Transgression</h3>\n<p>When a caster of divine magic fumbles due to Overcasting, he must roll d% on the Divine Transgression table. The transgression might be that he misspoke a prayer or performed a holy ritual incorrectly. The caster’s deity, or their intercessor, might decide to teach them a lesson.

This is so that the Overcasting of higher-level spells becomes relatively more dangerous. In this case, add the level of the spell to the Overcasting Success throw number needed to avoid a fumble or, alternatively, add the level of the spell to the roll on the Arcane Calamity and Divine Disfavor tables.</p>\n<h4>Proficiencies</h4>\n<p>At the Judge’s discretion, the following Class Proficiencies become available to Arcane and Divine casters. Players who elect to use any of these proficiencies must substitute each one taken for an existing class proficiency, permanently losing access to the replaced proficiency.</p>\n<h6>Careful Overcaster</h6>\n<p>When taking double the amount of time to Overcast a spell, the character gains a bonus of +4 to the Overcasting Success throw, instead of the normal +2 bonus.</p>\n<h6>Master Overcaster</h6>\n<p>The character gains a +1 to all Overcasting Success throws. This proficiency may be taken only once.</p>\n",

  "rawMarkdown": "## Overcasting\n\nIn some settings, spellcasters can push themselves beyond the ordinary limits of magic, accomplishing more than is normally possible – albeit at great risk. Use these rules if you want magic-users to be more powerful and unpredictable.\n\n### Overview\n\nCasters of Arcane and Divine magic can attempt to Overcast extra spells beyond those they are allotted each day. Each time that a spell is Overcast, however, the player must roll a d20 and consult the Overcasting Success table. Failure results in a fumble. Throwing an unmodified 20 results in an automatic Overcasting Success. Throwing an unmodified 1 is an automatic failure.\n\nSubsequent attempts to Overcast require successively higher throws to succeed. The Overcasting Success throw is reset each time the caster meets his studious or prayerful requirements.\n\nEXAMPLE: A 1st-level mage can normally cast one 1st-level spell per day. If she elects to Overcast a second 1st-level spell on the same day before resting, she fumbles the spell on a throw of 1-5. A third spell cast through Overcasting before resting will result in a fumble on a d20 throw of 1-10.\n\nA caster cannot Overcast spells of a level to which he does not already have access. However, custom classes built with the alternative spell progression table (who cannot cast spells at 1st level), can Overcast 1st-level spells, even though they do not normally have access to spellcasting until 2nd-level. Doing so is considered the first Overcast of the day and requires an Overcasting Success throw of 6+.\n\nA caster can choose to spend double the time Overcasting a spell in order to gain a bonus of +2 to the Overcasting Success throw. In most cases, this means taking two rounds to Overcast a spell. The player must indicate that he is taking double the casting time when the casting of the spell is declared. Note that if the character takes damage or fails a saving throw at any time during the Overcast before the spell goes off, the spell is lost. In this case, no success throw is made, but it does count as an attempt.\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Overcasting Success** | | |\n| Attempt of the Day | Throw | Throw w/ Double Time |\n| 1st | 6+ | 4+ |\n| 2nd | 11+ | 9+ |\n| 3rd | 16+ | 14+ |\n| 4th | 20+ | 18+ |\n\n### Arcane Calamity\n\nWhen a caster of arcane magic fumbles due to Overcasting, he must roll d% on the Arcane Calamity table. A calamity represents a mistake of some kind. Perhaps the caster mispronounced a magical syllable, or waggled his fingers the wrong way. The caster might also have let his guard down, allowing the extra-planar creature he had bound to his will to gain the upper hand.\n\n### Divine Transgression\n\nWhen a caster of divine magic fumbles due to Overcasting, he must roll d% on the Divine Transgression table. The transgression might be that he misspoke a prayer or performed a holy ritual incorrectly. The caster’s deity, or their intercessor, might decide to teach them a lesson. It might just be a rough day in the Spheres of Existence. The gods are fickle, callous, and pernicious, and they and their representatives sometimes care little for the travails of mere mortals.\n\n### Axioms Tables\n\nThe Arcane Calamity and Divine Transgression tables presented in ***ACKS II***have been modified from their original tables published in ***AXIOMS Issue 1****.* While the odds of a negative outcome are identical on both tables, the original ***AXIOMS***tables have a wider variety of effects, many of which could permanently change the campaign setting by e.g. creating places of power, altering the weather, inflicting a plague, and so on. These results could be very exciting, but they made some Judges reluctant to introduce overcasting into their campaigns because they did not want low-level casters to be able to have such a powerful impact when they screwed up. However, if you prefer your magic to be wild, powerful, and strange, the tables found in ***AXIOMS Issue 1***are fully compatible with ***ACKS II****.*\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **1d100** | **Arcane Calamity** |\n| **01-60** | **Failure:** The overcasting fails, but nothing else untoward occurs to the caster. |\n| **61-65** | **Stunned:** The overcasting fails, and the caster becomes **vulnerable** until the start of his next initiative. |\n| **66-68** | **Random:** The caster casts a random spell of the same level from his repertoire instead of the intended spell. |\n| **69-71** | **Internalized:** The overcasting fails, and the caster takes 1d4 extraordinary arcane damage per spell level. |\n| **72-74** | **Target Self:** The caster targets himself. If the spell is beneficial, treat this as an Internalized result. |\n| **75-77** | **Target Ally:** The caster targets a random ally in range. If there are no allies in range, treat this as a Target Self result. |\n| **78-80** | **Spellcasting Loss:** The overcasting fails and the caster loses the ability to cast arcane spells for 1d4+1 rounds. |\n| **81-83** | **Unconscious:** The overcasting fails and the caster falls **unconscious** for 1d4+1 rounds. |\n| **84-86** | **Repertoire Loss:** The overcasting fails and the caster loses the spell from his repertoire until he gets 8 hours of restful sleep. |\n| **87-89** | **Severe Spellcasting Loss:** The overcasting fails and the caster loses the ability to cast arcane spells until he gets 8 hours of restful sleep. |\n| **90-91** | **Repertoire Loss:** The overcasting fails and the spell is lost from the caster’s repertoire. It can be re-learned or replaced. |\n| **92-93** | **Prone to Calamity:** The overcasting fails and the caster permanently increases his overcasting target value by 1. |\n| **94-95** | **Spell Signature:** The overcasting fails and the caster suffers a permanent side effect. Roll on the Spell Signature sub-table. |\n| **96-97** | **Age:** The overcasting fails and the caster is aged 1d4 years per spell level. |\n| **98** | **Mutated:** The overcasting fails and the caster’s body is magically mutated. Roll 2d10-1 on the Magical Mutations sub-table. |\n| **99** | **Explosion:** The overcasting fails. The caster explodes in a disgusting shower of blood and gore, dying instantly. The explosion deals 1d6 extraordinary arcane damage per spell level in a radius of 5’ per spell level around the caster. Creatures within the radius who make a successful Blast saving throw reduce damage by half. |\n| **100** | **Death:** Arcane energies from another sphere of existence obliterate the caster utterly. The caster cannot be restored to life by any means short of *miracle* or *wish*. |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **1d100** | **Divine Transgression** |\n| **01-60** | **Failure:** The overcasting fails, but nothing else untoward occurs to the caster. |\n| **61-65** | **Prostration Required:** The god demands public prostration in exchange for granting the spell. The caster can choose to fall **prone** in obeisance or remain standing. If he falls prone, the overcasting succeeds. If he remains standing, it fails. |\n| **66-68** | **Trickster:** The caster’s god does not hear his prayer, but another god takes the opportunity to intervene. The caster casts a random spell of the same level from the divine spell list instead of the intended spell. |\n| **69-71** | **Castigation:** The overcasting succeeds, but the caster is wracked with wounds. He takes 1d4 extraordinary luminous damage per spell level. (If Chaotic, he takes necrotic damage.) |\n| **72-74** | **Target Self:** The caster targets himself. If the spell is beneficial, treat this as a Castigation result. |\n| **75-77** | **Target Ally:** The caster targets a random ally in range. If there are no allies in range, treat this as a Target Self result. |\n| **78-80** | **Divine Link Severed:** The overcasting fails and the caster loses the ability to cast divine spells for 1d4+1 rounds. |\n| **81-83** | **Unconscious:** The overcasting fails and the caster falls unconscious for 1d4+1 rounds. |\n| **84-86** | **Repertoire Loss:** The overcasting fails and the caster is no longer allowed to cast that spell until he receives an *atonement*. |\n| **87-89** | **Severe Divine Disfavor:** The overcasting fails and the caster becomes **disfavored** until he is the beneficiary of an *atonement*. |\n| **90-91** | **Loss of Powers:** The overcasting fails and the caster loses any class powers other than spellcasting until he receives an *atonement.* |\n| **92-93** | **Divine Dislike:** The overcasting fails and the caster permanently increases his overcasting target value by 1. |\n| **94-95** | **Divine Signature:** The overcasting fails and the caster suffers a permanent side effect. Roll on the Spell Signature sub-table. |\n| **96-97** | **Mission from God:** The overcasting succeeds, but the caster is given a *quest* to serve his deity. |\n| **98-99** | **Bolt from Heaven:** The deity smites the caster with a bolt from heaven. The caster is immediately slain. While he can be restored to life, no one of his faith will do so willingly. Any divine caster of the same god who casts *restore life and limb* on the caster will also be smote by the deity! |\n| **100** | **Death:** At the behest of the caster’s deity, shadowy servants of death erupt from the ground and pull him body and soul into the underworld. The caster cannot be restored to life by any means short of *miracle* or *wish*. |\n\n### Additional Rules\n\nThe following additional rules are included to provide the Judge with additional ways to augment Overcasting for her campaign.\n\n#### Calamity and Disfavor\n\nThe Judge should feel free to use the Arcane Calamity and Divine Transgression tables for appropriate situations other than Overcasting. For example, if a Cleric does something particularly offensive in the eyes of his deity, perhaps a roll on the Divine Transgression table is in order.\n\n#### Power and Risk\n\nSome Judges might prefer that the risk of Overcasting should increase with the power of the spell being attempted. This is so that the Overcasting of higher-level spells becomes relatively more dangerous. In this case, add the level of the spell to the Overcasting Success throw number needed to avoid a fumble or, alternatively, add the level of the spell to the roll on the Arcane Calamity and Divine Disfavor tables.\n\n#### Proficiencies\n\nAt the Judge’s discretion, the following Class Proficiencies become available to Arcane and Divine casters. Players who elect to use any of these proficiencies must substitute each one taken for an existing class proficiency, permanently losing access to the replaced proficiency.\n\n###### Careful Overcaster\n\nWhen taking double the amount of time to Overcast a spell, the character gains a bonus of +4 to the Overcasting Success throw, instead of the normal +2 bonus.\n\n###### Master Overcaster\n\nThe character gains a +1 to all Overcasting Success throws. This proficiency may be taken only once.\n"
