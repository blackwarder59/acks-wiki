They are determined by supply and a demand, and they change in response to changes to that supply and demand. In any given year, month, week, or even day the price of a good can fluctuate widely. In any given town, county, state, or nation, it can vary with geography. It is exceptionally difficult to simulate dynamic and subjective prices in a tabletop role-playing game, and largely unnecessary outside of a limited scope (arbitrage trading, perhaps). All RPGs largely depend on static and objective prices.</p>\n<p>In the long term, prices are relational. Offering goods and services requires consuming goods and services. The price of a good or service must exceed the cost of the goods and services consumed in offering it; those in turn must exceed the cost of the goods and services consumed in offering them; and so on. Ultimately, the price of food must exceed the cost of producing food, directly measured in food required to feed the family producing it, or a society cannot have any economic activity beyond subsistence. Unlike dynamic and subjective prices, relational prices <em>can</em> be simulated. If the game is to be coherent at campaign scale, they <em>must</em> be simulated. Having proper relations between prices has long been the goal for <em><strong>ACKS</strong></em><em>,</em> and was the goal introduced in our very first post on the Autarch blog, entitled <em>Starting from the Ground Up</em>:</p>\n<p>Unlike many contemporary fantasy RPGs, the Adventurer Conqueror King System has been designed with the view that many gamemasters want to be able to simulate an ancient and/or medieval world in such a way that their campaign world makes sense. The income of peasants makes sense in relation to the income of kings. The cost of swords and the income of the swordsmiths who make them has some relation. Treasure exists in more forms than simply gold, gems, and magic. The easiest and best way to achieve a world with verisimilitude is to start with historical assumptions.</p>\n<p>But starting with historical assumptions does not mean just using historical prices. Indeed, the most common mistake that designers make in pricing goods and services is to compile historical price lists from widely separate regions or eras, assume that those prices were static and objective, and then ignore the relations between them. These “Cargo Cult” prices are everywhere in RPGs.</p>\n<p>When the original Auran Empire campaign began, we were using the prices found in the <em>D&amp;D Rules Cyclopedia</em>. As the game progressed into high levels, where military affairs and domain rulership become ever-more-important, it became clear to me that the prices didn’t relate to each other correctly. As we sought other solutions, we reviewed <em>OD&amp;D, AD&amp;D,</em> and even Dave Arneson’s <em>First Fantasy Campaign.</em> As we explained in <em>Starting from the Ground Up, Part II</em>:</p>\n<p>In the <em>D&amp;D Cyclopedia</em>, a peasant family is worth 12gp per month, while in the <em>First Fantasy Campaign</em> its worth only 3gp per month. Meanwhile, in both <em>D&amp;D Cyclopedia</em> and <em>First Fantasy</em>, a heavy footman costs just 1/4 of that, or 3gp per month. The gp revenue per peasant for <em>First Fantasy</em> is too low relative to historical values and compared to other prices in the rules. A footman paid 3gp per month cannot afford to live on the prices in the rules. Since the <em>First Fantasy Campaign</em> undervalued the value of a peasant, the <em>First Fantasy Campaign</em> had to set its population densities vastly in excess of historical standards, which was necessary to provide sufficient funds for the players to field appropriately sized armies. Meanwhile the <em>D&amp;D Cyclopedia</em> has population densities vastly below historical standards, which was necessary because <em>D&amp;D Cyclopedia</em> has undervalued how much armies cost. The <em>First Fantasy Campaign</em> has densely packed countrysides filled with inefficient farmers paying the wages of dirt-cheap soldiers; while <em>D&amp;D Cyclopedia</em> has empty countrysides filled with standard medieval farmers in just sufficient numbers to pay the wages of dirt-cheap soldiers.</p>\n<p>The earliest foundations of our hobby had gotten the core relationship between the price of labor, the price of food, and the price of soldiers totally wrong! <em><strong>ACKS II</strong></em>has corrected this, in what is arguably its most important economic improvement of what has come before. These solutions have already been discussed under Baseline Assumptions earlier in this appendix.</p>\n<p>But what about the price of everything else?</p>\n<h3>How ACKS Prices Were Set</h3>\n<p>To correctly set the relational price of any given good or service in <em><strong>ACKS</strong></em><em>,</em> we needed a historical price for the good, and the historical price for wheat, extracted from the same time and place. Otherwise we’d just have Cargo Cult prices.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, while developing <em><strong>ACKS II</strong></em><em>,</em> we were able to find an English translation of all of the known fragments of the <em>Edictum de Pretiis Rerum Venalium,</em> better known as the Edict on Maximum Prices. Issued in 301 AD by Emperor Diocletian, the Edict sets the maximum price for hundreds of goods and services in denarii.</p>\n<p>What makes the Edict so useful for <em><strong>ACKS</strong></em>is that it is set in the time period that the Auran Empire campaign emulates, Late Antiquity. By knowing how much a Diocletian denarii was worth in <em><strong>ACKS</strong></em><em>,</em> we were able to use the Edict to establish historical prices for the huge number of goods and services that it covers. Since <em><strong>ACKS</strong></em>prices were benchmarked against wheat, where 1 quarter of wheat costs 4gp, we were able to use the price of wheat in the Edict to work out the value of the denarii.</p>\n<p>The Edict tells us that 1 modius kastrensis (“k. mod.”) of wheat sold for 100 denarii. The modius is a unit of dry measure equivalent to 8.73 liters. The modius kastrensis is equal to 1.5 modius, hence 12.93 liters. 12.93 liters of wheat weighs 22.15lbs. Since a quarter of wheat is 480lbs, there are (480/22.15 =) 21.67 k. mod per quarter. Therefore the price of a quarter of wheat, under the Edict, is (100 denarii / k. mod) x (21.67 k. mod / quarter) = 2166.33 denarii. We have established that 1 quarter of wheat is worth 4gp. Therefore 4gp/quarter = 2166 denarii/quarter; and 1gp = 541.58 denarii.</p>\n<p>With this conversion rate established, we are able to establish wheat-relative prices for all the various goods and services extracted from the Edict and convert them into denominations of gp, sp, and cp. However, as we did so, we discovered that just because a price is in the Edict doesn’t necessarily mean it’s the proper price for <em><strong>ACKS</strong></em><em>.</em> For one thing, the Edict itself was a price fixing statute, and governments have a long history of getting price controls very wrong. Diocletian might have been – for all we know – as bad at pricing goods and services as the typical RPG. In addition, the very particular conditions means that some prices might be peculiar to that place and time. From time to time, we even encountered prices in the Edict that were mathematically impossible – goods selling for less than their cost of production, for instance. In such cases we have revised the prices based on other research. Finally, we must also note that certain adventuring equipment in <em><strong>ACKS II</strong></em>are simply not priced historically. In particular:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>While the medium and heavy armors are correctly priced, padded and leather armor are too expensive relative to historical norms. Padded armor should probably be 2-5gp while leather armor should be no more than 5gp. For simplicity we standardized at 10gp = 1 AC = 1 stone.</li>\n<li>Grappling hooks and other climbing gear do not seem to have been in wide use during Late Antiquity. Their use in naval warfare (with grappling ballista) is notable enough that the ancient historians go out of their way to mention it. We have retained them in <em><strong>ACKS II</strong></em><em>,</em> but raised the price to reflect that they are a specialized technology not otherwise in use.</li>\n<li>Healing herbs with the potent efficacy of those found in <em><strong>ACKS II</strong></em>are simply fantasy. No poultice of comfrey or woundwort had anywhere near the curative power we have assigned them. However, healing herbs with a realistic level of efficacy would have almost no discernable game effect. Therefore we have magnified the efficacy of healing herbs to a playable (albeit fantastical) level, and increased their cost to an ahistorical level to compensate. If verisimilitude is a worry, assume the healing herbs are rare, fragile, and hard-to-find varietals of the real-world herbs.</li>\n<li>Lanterns of the sort described in the Adventuring Equipment section did not exist in Late Antiquity. However, they probably <em>would have</em> existed in a Late Antiquity in which legionaries had to enter dungeons to fight monsters. Therefore we have included them in the game but at an ahistorical high cost. The same is true for adventurer’s harnesses, disguise kits, thieves’ tools, and other adventuring equipment. All of these items were well within the capabilities of the ancients.</li>\n<li>The carts and wagons that existed in Late Antiquity were relatively primitive in the construction of their harnesses, yokes, and wheels. Rather than force adventurers to endlessly deal with broken axels, oxen choking on poor harness, and so on, we have included vehicles more appropriate for a later era and raised the price accordingly. You can simulate historical carts and wagons by applying some of the cost reduction and penalties from the scavenged equipment tables.</li>\n</ul>\n",
