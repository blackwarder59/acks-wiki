Sea voyages are common in the mid- and high-levels of play but can happen earlier if the campaign is focused on nautical action.</p>\n<h3>Sequence of Play (Sea Voyages)</h3>\n<p>During a sea voyage, gameplay is handled in increments of <strong>game days</strong> and <strong>hours</strong>. Each game day, the adventurers can undertake 1 dedicated activity (8 hours) and 4 ancillary activities (1 hour each).</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Determine Weather:</strong> Determine the wind strength and wind direction (<em><strong>ACKS II RR</strong></em>, p. XX). Optionally, determine overall weather conditions. Weather conditions such as Frigid, Foggy, Rainy, Stormy, Windy, etc. can apply penalties to certain activities.</li>\n<li><strong>Check for Starvation, Dehydration, and Scurvy:</strong> Check to see if any creatures on the voyage are starving, dehydrated, or scurvy. If so, starving creatures lose 1 CON and dehydrated creatures lose 1d6 CON (or 2d6 CON if weather conditions are Sweltering). Scurvy characters lose 1 STR and 1 CON immediately and another point of STR and CON each week thereafter during this step.</li>\n<li><strong>Determine Activities:</strong> Ask the party what dedicated and/or ancillary activities it plans to undertake. Usually this will simply be traveling.</li>\n<li><strong>Check for Daily Encounters:</strong> If the vessel is under anchor or the crew will be fishing, roll to see if any random encounters will occur that day. If a random encounter will occur, roll 1d12 to determine the hour of its occurrence.</li>\n<li><strong>Check if the Vessel is Lost:</strong> If the vessel is moving, check to see if it stays on course (<em><strong>ACKS II RR</strong></em>, p. XX). If it gets lost, determine the direction they will erroneously be sailing.</li>\n<li><strong>Adjudicate Each Hour:</strong> Each of the 12 adventuring hours in the day, follow the steps below.<ol>\n<li><em>Determine Direction of Sail:</em> Ask the captain of the vessel what direction the vessel is sailing.</li>\n<li><em>Determine Maximum Vessel Speed:</em> Determine the vessel’s maximum speed for the hour based on its direction, the wind direction, and the wind strength.</li>\n<li><em>Determine Actual Vessel Speed:</em> Ask the captain of the vessel the actual speed. (Sometimes the captain might want to sail at less than maximum speed so as not to overshoot a destination.)</li>\n<li><em>Adjudicate Special Activities:</em> If the party is undertaking any activities this hour, adjudicate them now.</li>\n<li><em>Adjudicate Movement:</em> Adjust the vessel’s position on your nautical map based on one hour of travel at its chosen speed in the appropriate direction. If this causes the party to enter a new hex, roll to see if a random encounter occurs. If an encounter occurs, follow the encounter procedure (described below).</li>\n<li><em>Adjudicate Weather Effects.</em> If weather conditions are Frigid, check to see if any creature becomes hypothermic either from cold water or lack of protective clothing. Each hypothermic creature loses 1d3 CON now. If weather conditions are Sweltering, check to see if any creatures in heavy armor become fatigued now.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Resolve Fishing:</strong> If any adventurers or crew have been fishing, roll to see if they caught fish. If so, add the fish to their available supplies of rations.</li>\n<li><strong>Consume Rations:</strong> Mark off no, half, or full food rations and no, half, or full water rations for each creature on the journey.<ol>\n<li>If any underfed creature eats a full ration of food, the condition ends.</li>\n<li>If any starving creature eats a full ration of food, the condition ends and the creature becomes underfed.</li>\n<li>If any dehydrated creature drinks a full ration of water, the condition ends.</li>\n<li>If any creature has gone 2 consecutive days without food, or 5 consecutive days with half rations, it becomes underfed.</li>\n<li>If any creature has been underfed for 5 days with no food, or for 10 days with an average of half rations, it becomes starving.</li>\n<li>If any creature has gone a day without water, or 2 days with half water, it becomes dehydrated.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Adjudicate Weather Effects:</strong> Follow the steps below to resolve any additional weather effects.<ol>\n<li><em>Disease:</em> If any creature has suffered seven consecutive days of Frigid or Rainy weather, check to see if it catches a disease (10% chance). If so, resolve the disease using the rules on p. XX.</li>\n<li><em>Hypothermia:</em> If any creature on the expedition was hypothermic or suffered cold damage in Frigid temperatures, check to see if they suffer Frostbite. If so, resolve its effects.</li>\n<li><em>Snow:</em> If conditions were Flurry for three consecutive days or Snowy today, terrain becomes Snowy. If conditions were Sweltering today, or Mild for the past seven days, the snow melts.</li>\n<li><em>Sunburn:</em> If conditions were Sunbaked today, creatures that lacked protective clothing take 1 fire damage.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Adjudicate Fatigue</strong>: Check to see if any creatures on the expedition has undertaken six consecutive days of strenuous activity (or the equivalent thereof by force marching). If so, it becomes fatigued (<em><strong>ACKS II</strong></em> <em>RR,</em> p. XX).</li>\n<li><strong>Adjudicate Healing</strong>: If any characters rested, they heal 1d3 hit points, or 2d3 hit points if under the care of a healer.</li>\n<li><strong>Assess Nighttime Situation</strong>: If the vessel is anchoring at night, roll to see if any random encounters will occur that night. If a random encounter will occur, roll 1d12 to determine the hour of its occurrence and resolve it at that time. If under sail or oar, revert to step 1 and run 12 hours of nighttime travel.</li>\n<li><strong>Advance Calendar:</strong> Mark off 1 day of game time.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Do not feel strictly beholden to this sequence. Sometimes, to adjudicate the action, you’ll need to adjust the sequence of events, other times disregard it altogether. The sequence of play is just intended as a checklist, not a mandate from heaven.</p>\n<h3>Encounters at Sea</h3>\n<p>Like wilderness expeditions, sea voyages can confront adventurers with dangerous monsters, hazardous terrain, and more.</p>\n<h4>Frequency of Encounter Throws</h4>\n<p>The frequency of sea encounter throws is determined by the activities of the vessel and the classification of the territory. For purposes of encounters, sea territory can be classified as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sea hexes within 6 miles (1 hex) of shoreland have the same territory classification of the shoreland.</li>\n<li>Sea hexes more than 6 miles but less than 24 miles (4 hexes) from shore reduce the territory classification of the shoreland by one step (e.g. from civilized to borderlands).</li>\n<li>All other sea hexes count as unsettled.</li>\n</ul>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Activity</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Civilized</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Borderlands</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Outlands</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Unsettled</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Anchored/Beached (day)</td>\n<td>None</td>\n<td>None</td>\n<td>None</td>\n<td>Once per 12 hours</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Anchored/Beached (night)</td>\n<td>Once per 7 nights</td>\n<td>Once per 3 nights</td>\n<td>Once per 12 hours</td>\n<td>Once per 12 hours</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Fishing</td>\n<td>Once per attempt</td>\n<td>Once per attempt</td>\n<td>Once per attempt</td>\n<td>Once per attempt</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Searching</td>\n<td>Once per hour</td>\n<td>Once per hour</td>\n<td>Once per hour</td>\n<td>Once per hour</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Sailing/Rowing</td>\n<td>Once per 24-mile hex</td>\n<td>Once per 24-mile hex</td>\n<td>Once per 24-mile hex</td>\n<td>Once per 24-mile hex</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Sailing/Rowing (trade route)</td>\n<td>Once per 6-mile hex</td>\n<td>Once per 6-mile hex</td>\n<td>Once per 6-mile hex</td>\n<td>Once per 6-mile hex</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h4>Making Sea Encounter Throws</h4>\n<p>To make a sea encounter throw, follow these steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Roll 1d20 on the appropriate column of the Sea Encounters by Territory Classification table.</li>\n<li>If the roll indicates a “Column Shift, Roll Again” result, shift one column right on the Sea Encounters by Territory Classifications table and roll again.</li>\n<li>If the roll indicates a “No Encounter” result, there is no encounter.</li>\n<li>If the roll indicates a “Civilized Encounter” result, roll 1d100 on the Civilized Encounter by Territory Classification table to find the type of creature encountered.</li>\n<li>If the roll indicates a “Monster Encounter” result:<ol>\n<li>Roll 1d20 on the Monster Rarity by Territory Classification table and consult the resulting sub-table for the terrain type.</li>\n<li>Roll 1d100 on the appropriate Monster Encounter by Terrain Type and Rarity to find the type of creature encountered.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>If creatures have been encountered in steps 4 or 5:<ol>\n<li>Find the encountered creature’s entry in the <em><strong>ACKS II Monstrous Manual</strong></em>and roll against its <strong>Lair</strong> characteristic to determine whether the creature is in its lair. (If the creature is in its lair, a <strong>dynamic lair</strong> can be used if one is available).</li>\n<li>Roll the appropriate <strong>number encountered</strong> for the creature to determine how many are present.</li>\n<li>Follow the rules for Sea Encounter Distance to determine the distance in feet at the start of the encounter. If the creature is in its lair, the encounter distance is the distance to the lair. (If the lair is underwater, the depth counts as additional distance). If the creature is outside its lair, the encounter distance is the distance to the creature.</li>\n<li>Check for surprise and evasion, where necessary, and then proceed to reactions or combat.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>If the roll indicates a “Nautical Encounter” result, treat it as a result of “No Encounter” if the party is anchored/beached or is following a known or previously-charted route. Otherwise, roll 1d12 on the appropriate Nautical Encounter sub-table to determine the nature of the encounter.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The results of rolls on the Sea Encounter tables and sub-tables should always be handled in a fashion that makes sense in the context of the terrain, weather, time of year, and other factors. If necessary to maintain the verisimilitude of the setting, disregard the result and roll again.</p>\n<h4>Sea Encounter by Territory Classification</h4>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td></td>\n<td><strong>Civilized +</strong>  <strong>Trade Route</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Civilized or Borderlands</strong>  <strong>+ Trade Route</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Borderlands or</strong>  <strong>Outlands + Trade Route</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Outlands or</strong>  <strong>Unsettled +</strong>  <strong>Trade Route</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Unsettled</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Column Shift, Roll Again</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td><strong>-</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>No Encounter</td>\n<td>2 - 13</td>\n<td>2 – 12</td>\n<td>2 – 12</td>\n<td>2 – 11</td>\n<td>1 – 10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Civilized Encounter</td>\n<td>14 - 20</td>\n<td>13 – 18</td>\n<td>13 – 16</td>\n<td>12 - 14</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Monster Encounter</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>19</td>\n<td>17 – 19</td>\n<td>15 – 18</td>\n<td>11 – 17</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Nautical Encounter</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>19 - 20</td>\n<td>18 - 20</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>Roll 1d20 on the appropriate column of the Sea Encounters by Territory Classification table.

Generate the castaway using the tables on p. XX – p. XX. The castaway will automatically have a Friendly reactions if rescued. He knows one rumor (probably related to whatever destroyed his vessel) and could be recruited as a henchman.</p>\n<p><strong>Derelict:</strong> The vessel spots a derelict drifting in the water. Roll 1d20 on the Vessels sub-table to determine the type of vessel. The derelict has only 2d4 x 10% of its SHP, the rest having been lost to battle damage, monster attack, weather, or other causes. There is a 25% chance the derelict’s hold will contain cargo equal to its maximum capacity times its percentage of SHP remaining. Roll once on the Random Merchandise table for every 1,000 st to determine the type.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: The adventurers’ vessel spots a derelict. The Judge rolls 1d20 on the Vessel sub-table and gets a 16, so the derelict is a small sailing ship (75 SHP and 10,000 st cargo capacity). The Judge uses 2d4 x 10% to determine how many structural hit points the derelict has left; he rolls 40%, so the ship has only 30 SHP remaining. Next the Judge checks to see if the derelict is carrying cargo; a roll of 17 on 1d100 says it is. Since it has only 40% of its SHP, it has only 40% of its maximum cargo, or 4,000 st. The Judge rolls for 4 lots of 1,000 st each on the Random Merchandise table.</p>\n<p><strong>Favorable Current:</strong> The vessel benefits from a strong underwater current that helps propel it in its desired direction. The vessel’s speed is increased by 50% in this hex.</p>\n<p><strong>Favored Winds:</strong> The gods of the seas have smiled on the vessel, and it enjoys favorable winds. If the vessel is not running before the wind, shift the wind direction by 30 degrees towards the vessel’s preferred direction. If the vessel is already running before the wind, adjust the wind speed by one step towards strong.</p>\n<p><strong>Flotsam:</strong> The vessel spots cargo floating on the water. The encounter distance to the flotsam is determined as if they were flying creatures. There will be 2d6 lots each of 1,000 st. Roll on the Random Merchandise table for each lot, re-rolling results of common metal, tools, armor &amp; weapons, and precious merchandise.</p>\n<p><strong>Good Omen:</strong> The vessel is blessed with a good omen, such as an albatross flying around the ship, dolphins swimming at the bow, or a rainbow appearing in the sky. The crew is so inspired that it can ignore the next morale calamity that occurs.</p>\n<p><strong>Monster Carcass:</strong> The vessel comes upon the floating carcass of a monster or monsters. Roll on the Monster Encounter table to determine the type of creature(s). The encounter distance to the carcass(es) is determined as if they were flying creatures. The corpse(s) are 1d4 days old. The monster will have salvageable parts as per <em><strong>ACKS Lairs &amp; Encounters</strong></em> <em>or</em> <em><strong>ACKS II Monstrous Manual</strong></em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Navigational Sign:</strong> The navigator benefits from a lighthouse, landmark, or other astronomical or terrain feature that helps keep him on course. If the vessel is currently lost, the navigator learns its actual position. If the vessel is currently on course, the navigator gains a +4 bonus to his next throw to avoid getting lost. Mark down the location of the navigational sign on your campaign map, as it will remain there going forward.</p>\n<p><strong>Plentiful Fish:</strong> The vessel has sailed into a region of water with abundant sea-life. Catching fish is as easy as lowering a line or tossing a net. Even if it does not stop to fish, the vessel gains 4d10 x 2 pounds of standard rations per 20 crew. If the vessel stops, each fisher that spends an ancillary activity fishing can capture 4d10 x 2 lbs of standard rations on a successful Fishing proficiency throw. Remember that 2 pounds of rations are sufficient to feed one person for one day. One week of rations weighs 1 stone. Be sure to mark down the location of plentiful fish on your campaign map, as it will remain there going forward.</p>\n<p><strong>Safe Haven:</strong> The vessel has spotted a safe haven such as a coastal cave or grotto, estuary, fjord or inlet, or hidden cove. It can anchor, beach, or harbor at the safe haven and enjoy protection from inclement weather and spotting by passersby. Do not roll encounter throws while the vessel is in the safe haven. Mark down the location of the safe haven on your campaign map, as it will remain there going forward. However, if the vessel is not within sight of the shore, treat this result as Smooth Sailing.</p>\n<p><strong>Smooth Sailing:</strong> The voyage is going as well as can be expected! The vessel ignores the next sea monster encounter or detrimental nautical encounter that would otherwise occur.</p>\n<p><strong>Double:</strong> Roll twice on this table. If either or both rolls are &#39;double&#39;, again, roll on Unique Nautical Encounters instead. If neither reroll is &#39;double&#39;, the vessel runs into both indicated beneficial nautical encounters.</p>\n<h6>Detrimental Nautical Encounters</h6>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Detrimental Encounter (1d12)</strong></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>1</strong></td>\n<td>Bad Omen</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>2</strong></td>\n<td>Dead Sea</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>3</strong></td>\n<td>Food Spoilage</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>4</strong></td>\n<td>Mariner Overboard</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>5</strong></td>\n<td>Nautical Challenge</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>6</strong></td>\n<td>Nautical Hazard</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>7</strong></td>\n<td>Rogue Wave</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>8</strong></td>\n<td>Rough Conditions</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>9</strong></td>\n<td>Unpredictable Weather</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>10</strong></td>\n<td>Water Spoilage</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>11</strong></td>\n<td>Wear-and-Tear</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>12</strong></td>\n<td>Double</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Bad Omen:</strong> The vessel’s crew is unsettled by a bad omen, such as an albatross getting injured by flying into the rigging, red skies appearing in the morning, or a shark following the ship. Being a superstitious lot, the crew considers this a morale calamity.</p>\n<p><strong>Dead Sea:</strong> The sea here is lifeless. This might be due to natural causes, such as hypoxic or oligotrophic conditions, or it might be due to magical or monstrous activity. The vessel cannot fish in this hex. Mark down the location of the dead sea on your campaign map, as it will remain there going forward.</p>\n<p><strong>Food Spoilage:</strong> Bad packing, mold infection, rat infestation, or some other accident or negligence causes the vessel to lose 2d10% of its stored food. The crew considers this a morale calamity.</p>\n<p><strong>Mariner Overboard:</strong> An NPC on the vessel has fallen from the rigging or been thrown overboard by the ship’s heaving and churning. Roll randomly to determine who has fallen overboard; there is an equal chance of it being any crew or passengers on deck. If not rescued (whether by magic, swimming, throwing a rope, etc.) the NPC will eventually drown. If the NPC is a crew member and no effort is made to rescue him, the remaining crew considers this a morale calamity.</p>\n<p><strong>Nautical Challenge:</strong> Accident, age, inclement weather, or wear-and-tear have caused a deterioration in a critical component of the vessel. Until the problem is fixed, the vessel cannot move at greater than 1/4 speed. Fixing the problem swiftly will require one of the crew to succeed on 1d3 difficult and dangerous proficiency throws. Roll 1d10 on the Challenge Type table to find the exact nature of the challenge. If a nautical challenge occurs during very strong winds (Windy conditions), apply a -4 penalty to the proficiency throw. If a nautical challenge occurs during gale winds (Stormy conditions), apply a -10 penalty. If none of the crew can or does meet the challenge, roll 1d12, adding 4 in Windy conditions and 10 in Stormy conditions. That many hours are lost finding another solution to the challenge.

Nautical hazards include underwater or partially submerged rocks, coral reefs, kelp forests, sandbars, seamounts, shoals, sunken wrecks, and whirlpools. Roll 1d20 to determine the nature of the hazard. (Feel free to devise other nautical hazards for your setting!) Unless the hazard is a recent development, characters with Navigation and Seafaring proficiency will know about the hazards on common routes and can simply sail or row around them.</p>\n<p>When a vessel enters a hex containing a nautical hazard, the captain must make a Seafaring proficiency throw of 11+ (7+ if master mariner). If the vessel is moving at 1/2 speed or less, the captain gains a +4 bonus. If the vessel is a galley or longship, the captain gains +4 if navigating sandbars/shoals. If the throw succeeds, the vessel safely traverses the hex. If the throw fails, the vessel runs into the hazard, suffering the effects described below. The suggestions for spells to escape nautical hazards are just that and are not intended to be an exclusive list of the ways a vessel might benefit from magic.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>*Kelp Forest:*The vessel is entangled in seaweed. It cannot move until it is disentangled. Disentangling the vessel requires 1d4 hours plus an additional hour per 60 tons the vessel weighs. A <em>disintegrate</em> or <em>dominate plants</em> spell can instantly disentangle the vessel.</li>\n<li>*Rock/Reef/Seamount/Wreck:*The vessel strikes the hazard below the waterline and suffers 8d10 structural piercing damage. If the vessel was traveling at 1/2 speed or less when it entered the hex, damage is halved.</li>\n<li>*Sandbar/Shoal:*The vessel runs aground and suffers 4d10 structural bludgeoning damage. If the vessel was traveling at 1/2 speed or less when it entered the hex, damage is halved. The vessel cannot move until it is refloated by high tide in 1d12 hours (Judge’s discretion) or until the vessel is freed from the shoal. The crew can attempt to free the vessel by lightening its load or by rocking it back and forth to dislodge it. Lightening the load grants a cumulative 5% chance the vessel escapes for every 200 st of cargo thrown overboard. Each crew member can unload 33 st of cargo per turn (200 st per hour). Rocking the vessel back and forth requires the entire crew to work at shifting ballast and cargo back and forth through the hold. Rocking the vessel grants a 5% cumulative chance per turn that the vessel escapes, but each time the roll fails the vessel suffers 1d4 structural bludgeoning damage. <em>Force of impetus</em> can dislodge the vessel immediately but deals 4d10 structural damage to it. <em>Earth’s movement</em> can dislodge the vessel in one turn.</li>\n<li>*Whirlpool:*The vessel is sucked into a whirling maelstrom of water with spouting upswelling fountains and swirling vortices of depressed water. When the vessel enters the whirlpool, and at the end of each round that it remains in the whirlpool, it suffers 25-40 (1d4+4 x 5) structural bludgeoning damage and each crew member on deck must succeed on a Paralysis saving throw or be thrown overboard and must swim or drown. Swimming proficiencies suffer a -8 penalty in a whirlpool. On the captain’s initiative, he can make a Seafaring proficiency throw to steer out of the whirlpool. The target value is based on the vessel’s speed, as if targeted by a <em>capsizing wave</em> (p. XX). If the captain’s proficiency throw succeeds, the vessel escapes. If the captain’s proficiency throw fails, the vessel does not escape that round.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Mark down the location of the nautical hazard on your campaign map, as it will remain there going forward.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Wind Speed</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Seafaring Throw</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Save Fails</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Save Succeeds</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Gentle</td>\n<td>+15</td>\n<td>1d4+4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Moderate</td>\n<td>+10</td>\n<td>1d4+4 x 5</td>\n<td>1d2+2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Strong</td>\n<td>+5</td>\n<td>1d4 +4 x 10</td>\n<td>1d4+4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Very Strong</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td>1d4+4 x 20</td>\n<td>1d4+4 x 2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Gale</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>1d4+4 x 50</td>\n<td>1d4+4 x 5</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Rogue Wave:</strong> A sudden and unexpected swell of water threatens to slam into the vessel, possibly capsizing it. Treat the rogue wave as a <em>capsizing wave</em> spell, but modify the damage and saving throw as shown based on wind conditions. Provided the captain succeeds on his Seafaring saving throw, the vessel cannot lose more than 25% of its SHP to this encounter. Re-roll this encounter if the wind speed is Still.</p>\n<p><strong>Rough Conditions:</strong> The water is choppy and rough, and the wind is ever-shifting. There is no particular challenge that can be overcome nor is there any danger or hazard that can be bypassed, it simply is just rough going. All speeds are reduced by 1/2 in this hex.</p>\n<p><strong>Unpredictable Weather:</strong> Nothing is as unpredictable as the weather at sea. When this encounter occurs, immediately re-roll the day’s weather, including temperature, precipitation, wind strength, and wind direction.</p>\n<p><strong>Water Spoilage:</strong> Leaky caskets, fouled water, or some other accident or negligence causes the vessel to lose 2d10% of its stored water. The crew considers this a morale calamity.</p>\n<p><strong>Wear-and-Tear:</strong> The vessel takes 1 structural bludgeoning damage from the wear-and-tear of salt water, waves, and winds. This damage cannot be repaired at sea but can be repaired if the ship beaches/docks. Note that this encounter is much more dangerous to small vessels with low SHP!</p>\n<p><strong>Double:</strong> Roll twice on this table. If either or both rolls are &#39;double&#39;, again, roll on Unique Terrain instead.

The statue is large enough to stretch to the sea floor below, while its highest point (head, trident, tentacle, or other feature) juts out from the waterline by 2d6 x 10’. If the colossal statue appears along a trade route, then it has only recently emerged in the last 1d3 days due to tectonic movement of the seabed, and its exposed portions will be covered by strands of kelp and seaweed. Mark down the location of the colossal statue on your campaign map, as it will remain there going forward.</p>\n<p>The appearance, magical powers, and significance of the statue is left to the Judge’s discretion. It could be anything from a curiosity to a dungeon crawl into the depths. In the Auran Empire campaign setting, roll 1d6 to determine which god the statue represents: 1-3 it’s Naurivus, Empyrean god of the high seas; 4-6 it’s Lammala, Chthonic god of the oceanic abyss. In either case, such a colossus could only have been built before the apocalyptic Day Without Night.</p>\n<p><strong>Damned Mariners:</strong> A mysterious vessel with tattered sails becomes visible on the horizon. Roll 1d10+5 on the Vessels sub-table to determine the type of vessel. However, this is no ordinary vessel – this is a ship crewed by the damned! Each mariner and marine is a <strong>haugbui</strong> while the navigator is a <strong>7HD draugr</strong> and the captain is <strong>9 HD</strong> <strong>draugr</strong>. (You can substitute other undead if desired.) The ship has lost 2d10% of its SHP to battle damage, monster attack, weather, or other causes, but this does not reduce its movement while the undead crew it. The damned crew are automatically hostile and will attempt to intercept the party’s vessel and board it.</p>\n<p>Treat the ship of the damned as the draugr’s barrow for all purposes; once the ship of the damned has grappled the party’s vessel, the party’s vessel is part of the barrow. If everyone on board the party’s vessel is slain or fled, the slain crew rise as haugbui under the command of the draugr. If among the slain crew there were leveled characters of 7th level or more, then the two highest level characters rise as draugr rather than haugbui. The damnation spreads...</p>\n<p>The ship as a whole is a blighted sinkhole of evil, which can only be purged by scuttling it. The ship of the damned will be laden with treasure – roll twice for treasure type Q.</p>\n<p><strong>Deafening Mist:</strong> The air falls still and mist suddenly shrouds the vessel. But this is no ordinary mist – it not only creates Foggy weather conditions that reduce visibility to just 20’, it also deadens all sound. All characters are considered <strong>deafened</strong> while in the mist. Does something lurk in this silent shroud? Maybe! Roll for an additional random encounter, treating a civilized encounter as no encounter. After resolving the encounter (if any), the vessel emerges from the mist one hour later, having traveled at its voyage speed in a random hex direction. The navigator must make an additional Navigation proficiency throw at a -4 penalty to avoid being lost with a -4 penalty.</p>\n<p><strong>Ghost Ship:</strong> The vessel spots a derelict drifting in the water. Roll 1d20 on the Vessels sub-table to determine the type of vessel. The vessel has lost 5d10% of its SHP to battle damage, monster attack, weather, or other causes. However, unlike an ordinary derelict, the vessel is a ghost ship. All of the mariners and marines are <strong>haunts</strong> confined to the vessel in endless repetition of the tasks they were doing just before death. The vessel as a whole is a shadowed sinkhole of evil. If the haunts are destroyed, the ship can be salvaged and its cargo claimed. For every 5 haunts, roll once on Treasure Type A.</p>\n<p><strong>Leviathan:</strong> A monstrous leviathan of some sort dwells in the depths. Roll a sea monster encounter to determine the type of leviathan, re-rolling any humanoids. If the encounter includes multiple monsters, only one of them is the leviathan, and it leads the others. The leviathan is always in a lair - even if its type does not normally make lairs. If the leviathan has less than 20 HD, increase its HD to 20 as a result of the powers it has been infused with. For each HD of increase, the leviathan’s AC improves by 1 and it deals an average of 2 hp more damage divided among all its attacks. Increase the monster&#39;s size by one category, to a minimum of Huge. If already Colossal, increase its HD by (another) 4 instead. If its alignment is Lawful or Neutral, change it to Chaotic. The leviathan’s lair is a shadowed sinkhole of evil. If it is slain, the sinkhole of evil will disperse in 1d4 days. The creature rarely goes far from its lair, but considers any vessels which traverse the vicinity to be prey. The lair will have normal treasure for the monster’s type, plus additional treasure type O. Mark down the location of the leviathan’s lair on your campaign map, as it will remain there going forward.</p>\n<p><strong>Magical Resource:</strong> The vessel comes upon a naturally-occurring magical resource worth 3d6 x 1,000gp. The resource might be eldritch coral, magic kelp, mana-infused fish, etc. Roll on the encounter table to find out what creature it counts as a component from. The magical resource does not require metamphora to store. It weighs 1 stone per 10 gp value. It takes one character an hour (one ancillary activity) to harvest 1,000gp worth of resources. Mark down the location of the magical resource on your campaign map, as it will remain there going forward. If the vessel returns later to the magical resource, they will find that more has grown; you can assign a growth rate (a reasonable average is approximately 33 months to restore the full amount) or reroll its value.</p>\n<p><strong>Marine Formation:</strong> The vessel comes upon marine formation of sublime beauty and vast extent. It could be a blue hole, a colorful coral reef, a kelp forest, an underwater waterfall, a seamount, etc. The marine formation has a 25% chance of also being a well of elemental water; roll on the table below for power. The marine formation has a 50% chance of being occupied by sea creatures; roll for a Sea Monster encounter and place a monster lair in the marine formation. Mark the location of the marine formation on your campaign map, as it will remain there going forward.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Roll (1d6)</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Treasure Type</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Average Value</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>1</strong></td>\n<td>K</td>\n<td>5,000 gp average value</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>2</strong></td>\n<td>L, J</td>\n<td>10,000 gp average value</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>3</strong></td>\n<td>P</td>\n<td>17,000 gp average value</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>4</strong></td>\n<td>Q</td>\n<td>22,000 gp average value</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>5</strong></td>\n<td>Ox2</td>\n<td>24,000 gp average value</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>6</strong></td>\n<td>Q, N</td>\n<td>31,000 gp average value</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Message in a Bottle:</strong> The vessel spots a sealed bottle floating in the water.

The exact nature of the message is left to your discretion but often such messages contain cryptic hints to the location of a valuable buried treasure. Roll 1d6 to determine the treasure type the message points to. The treasure is 1 hex away per 1,000 gp value (you can use the average value and roll the actual contents of the treasure later).</p>\n<p><strong>Place of Power:</strong> The vessel travels over or through a place of power of some kind. Roll to determine the type and power.

The portal might transfer only sensory information (sight and/or sound), or might allow travel through it. The portal might be always active, or might be limited in some fashion (such as functioning only during an eclipse). A portal that allows travel is always limited in some fashion (though a portal might be always active for sight and/or sound, but allow travel only in limited circumstances). You should choose a location for the other end of the portal that is appropriate for your setting. Note that the two ends of the portal can have different conditions for when they activate – for instance, one end could activate during a lunar eclipse while the other end activates during a solar eclipse – and the other end is not guaranteed to be a safe destination, making travel through an unknown portal extremely dangerous. At your discretion, the portal link might manifest in other ways than an actual portal (such as treating the two locations as the same for the purposes of spellcasting range). Mark down the location of the portals on your campaign map, as they will remain there going forward.</p>\n<p><strong>Sunken Treasure Ship:</strong> The vessel spots a shipwreck visible 100’ + 1d6 x 10’ below. If the vessel is currently in deeper water, then the shipwreck is on an atoll, coral reef, seamount, or similar structure. Roll 1d20 on the Vessels sub-table to determine the type of shipwreck. The shipwreck will contain treasure equal to its maximum capacity. Roll 1d100. On 1-90, the treasure is common metal ingots (such as bronze, copper, iron, lead, or tin) worth 2gp per stone. On 90-99, the treasure is 90% common metal ingots and 10% of the cargo is precious metal ingots (such as electrum, gold, platinum, silver, or tumbaga) worth 100gp per stone. On 100, the treasure is entirely precious metal ingots. A sunken treasure ship has a 75% chance to be the lair of a monster. Roll on the Sea Monster table.</p>\n<p><strong>Truly Unique:</strong> The vessel discovers something truly unique. This category is a catch-all for anything you want to place in the hex (for instance, something you saw in a third-party product and thought was awesome). If you (justifiably) feel that the point of a random table is to keep from having to invent things whole cloth like this, choose another result or reroll!</p>\n<p><strong>Double:</strong> Roll twice and combine the results, which may be a single terrain feature with two powers or two different terrain features, at your discretion. If the result is rolled again, ignore it and reroll (there cannot be more than two Unique effects in a hex).</p>\n",

If this causes the party to enter a new hex, roll to see if a random encounter occurs. If an encounter occurs, follow the encounter procedure (described below).</li>\n<li><em>Adjudicate Weather Effects.</em> If weather conditions are Frigid, check to see if any creature becomes hypothermic either from cold water or lack of protective clothing. Each hypothermic creature loses 1d3 CON now.

If so, resolve the disease using the rules on p.

If so, resolve its effects.</li>\n<li><em>Snow:</em> If conditions were Flurry for three consecutive days or Snowy today, terrain becomes Snowy. If conditions were Sweltering today, or Mild for the past seven days, the snow melts.</li>\n<li><em>Sunburn:</em> If conditions were Sunbaked today, creatures that lacked protective clothing take 1 fire damage.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Adjudicate Fatigue</strong>: Check to see if any creatures on the expedition has undertaken six consecutive days of strenuous activity (or the equivalent thereof by force marching). If so, it becomes fatigued (<em><strong>ACKS II</strong></em> <em>RR,</em> p. XX).</li>\n<li><strong>Adjudicate Healing</strong>: If any characters rested, they heal 1d3 hit points, or 2d3 hit points if under the care of a healer.</li>\n<li><strong>Assess Nighttime Situation</strong>: If the vessel is anchoring at night, roll to see if any random encounters will occur that night. If a random encounter will occur, roll 1d12 to determine the hour of its occurrence and resolve it at that time. If under sail or oar, revert to step 1 and run 12 hours of nighttime travel.</li>\n<li><strong>Advance Calendar:</strong> Mark off 1 day of game time.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Do not feel strictly beholden to this sequence.

The Judge uses 2d4 x 10% to determine how many structural hit points the derelict has left; he rolls 40%, so the ship has only 30 SHP remaining. Next the Judge checks to see if the derelict is carrying cargo; a roll of 17 on 1d100 says it is. Since it has only 40% of its SHP, it has only 40% of its maximum cargo, or 4,000 st. The Judge rolls for 4 lots of 1,000 st each on the Random Merchandise table.</p>\n<p><strong>Favorable Current:</strong> The vessel benefits from a strong underwater current that helps propel it in its desired direction. The vessel’s speed is increased by 50% in this hex.</p>\n<p><strong>Favored Winds:</strong> The gods of the seas have smiled on the vessel, and it enjoys favorable winds. If the vessel is not running before the wind, shift the wind direction by 30 degrees towards the vessel’s preferred direction. If the vessel is already running before the wind, adjust the wind speed by one step towards strong.</p>\n<p><strong>Flotsam:</strong> The vessel spots cargo floating on the water. The encounter distance to the flotsam is determined as if they were flying creatures. There will be 2d6 lots each of 1,000 st. Roll on the Random Merchandise table for each lot, re-rolling results of common metal, tools, armor &amp; weapons, and precious merchandise.</p>\n<p><strong>Good Omen:</strong> The vessel is blessed with a good omen, such as an albatross flying around the ship, dolphins swimming at the bow, or a rainbow appearing in the sky. The crew is so inspired that it can ignore the next morale calamity that occurs.</p>\n<p><strong>Monster Carcass:</strong> The vessel comes upon the floating carcass of a monster or monsters. Roll on the Monster Encounter table to determine the type of creature(s). The encounter distance to the carcass(es) is determined as if they were flying creatures. The corpse(s) are 1d4 days old. The monster will have salvageable parts as per <em><strong>ACKS Lairs &amp; Encounters</strong></em> <em>or</em> <em><strong>ACKS II Monstrous Manual</strong></em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Navigational Sign:</strong> The navigator benefits from a lighthouse, landmark, or other astronomical or terrain feature that helps keep him on course. If the vessel is currently lost, the navigator learns its actual position. If the vessel is currently on course, the navigator gains a +4 bonus to his next throw to avoid getting lost. Mark down the location of the navigational sign on your campaign map, as it will remain there going forward.</p>\n<p><strong>Plentiful Fish:</strong> The vessel has sailed into a region of water with abundant sea-life. Catching fish is as easy as lowering a line or tossing a net. Even if it does not stop to fish, the vessel gains 4d10 x 2 pounds of standard rations per 20 crew. If the vessel stops, each fisher that spends an ancillary activity fishing can capture 4d10 x 2 lbs of standard rations on a successful Fishing proficiency throw. Remember that 2 pounds of rations are sufficient to feed one person for one day. One week of rations weighs 1 stone. Be sure to mark down the location of plentiful fish on your campaign map, as it will remain there going forward.</p>\n<p><strong>Safe Haven:</strong> The vessel has spotted a safe haven such as a coastal cave or grotto, estuary, fjord or inlet, or hidden cove. It can anchor, beach, or harbor at the safe haven and enjoy protection from inclement weather and spotting by passersby. Do not roll encounter throws while the vessel is in the safe haven. Mark down the location of the safe haven on your campaign map, as it will remain there going forward. However, if the vessel is not within sight of the shore, treat this result as Smooth Sailing.</p>\n<p><strong>Smooth Sailing:</strong> The voyage is going as well as can be expected! The vessel ignores the next sea monster encounter or detrimental nautical encounter that would otherwise occur.</p>\n<p><strong>Double:</strong> Roll twice on this table. If either or both rolls are &#39;double&#39;, again, roll on Unique Nautical Encounters instead. If neither reroll is &#39;double&#39;, the vessel runs into both indicated beneficial nautical encounters.</p>\n"

This might be due to natural causes, such as hypoxic or oligotrophic conditions, or it might be due to magical or monstrous activity. The vessel cannot fish in this hex. Mark down the location of the dead sea on your campaign map, as it will remain there going forward.</p>\n<p><strong>Food Spoilage:</strong> Bad packing, mold infection, rat infestation, or some other accident or negligence causes the vessel to lose 2d10% of its stored food. The crew considers this a morale calamity.</p>\n<p><strong>Mariner Overboard:</strong> An NPC on the vessel has fallen from the rigging or been thrown overboard by the ship’s heaving and churning.

Nautical hazards include underwater or partially submerged rocks, coral reefs, kelp forests, sandbars, seamounts, shoals, sunken wrecks, and whirlpools. Roll 1d20 to determine the nature of the hazard. (Feel free to devise other nautical hazards for your setting!) Unless the hazard is a recent development, characters with Navigation and Seafaring proficiency will know about the hazards on common routes and can simply sail or row around them.</p>\n<p>When a vessel enters a hex containing a nautical hazard, the captain must make a Seafaring proficiency throw of 11+ (7+ if master mariner). If the vessel is moving at 1/2 speed or less, the captain gains a +4 bonus. If the vessel is a galley or longship, the captain gains +4 if navigating sandbars/shoals. If the throw succeeds, the vessel safely traverses the hex. If the throw fails, the vessel runs into the hazard, suffering the effects described below. The suggestions for spells to escape nautical hazards are just that and are not intended to be an exclusive list of the ways a vessel might benefit from magic.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>*Kelp Forest:*The vessel is entangled in seaweed. It cannot move until it is disentangled. Disentangling the vessel requires 1d4 hours plus an additional hour per 60 tons the vessel weighs. A <em>disintegrate</em> or <em>dominate plants</em> spell can instantly disentangle the vessel.</li>\n<li>*Rock/Reef/Seamount/Wreck:*The vessel strikes the hazard below the waterline and suffers 8d10 structural piercing damage. If the vessel was traveling at 1/2 speed or less when it entered the hex, damage is halved.</li>\n<li>*Sandbar/Shoal:*The vessel runs aground and suffers 4d10 structural bludgeoning damage. If the vessel was traveling at 1/2 speed or less when it entered the hex, damage is halved. The vessel cannot move until it is refloated by high tide in 1d12 hours (Judge’s discretion) or until the vessel is freed from the shoal. The crew can attempt to free the vessel by lightening its load or by rocking it back and forth to dislodge it. Lightening the load grants a cumulative 5% chance the vessel escapes for every 200 st of cargo thrown overboard. Each crew member can unload 33 st of cargo per turn (200 st per hour). Rocking the vessel back and forth requires the entire crew to work at shifting ballast and cargo back and forth through the hold. Rocking the vessel grants a 5% cumulative chance per turn that the vessel escapes, but each time the roll fails the vessel suffers 1d4 structural bludgeoning damage. <em>Force of impetus</em> can dislodge the vessel immediately but deals 4d10 structural damage to it. <em>Earth’s movement</em> can dislodge the vessel in one turn.</li>\n<li>*Whirlpool:*The vessel is sucked into a whirling maelstrom of water with spouting upswelling fountains and swirling vortices of depressed water. When the vessel enters the whirlpool, and at the end of each round that it remains in the whirlpool, it suffers 25-40 (1d4+4 x 5) structural bludgeoning damage and each crew member on deck must succeed on a Paralysis saving throw or be thrown overboard and must swim or drown. Swimming proficiencies suffer a -8 penalty in a whirlpool. On the captain’s initiative, he can make a Seafaring proficiency throw to steer out of the whirlpool. The target value is based on the vessel’s speed, as if targeted by a <em>capsizing wave</em> (p. XX). If the captain’s proficiency throw succeeds, the vessel escapes. If the captain’s proficiency throw fails, the vessel does not escape that round.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Mark down the location of the nautical hazard on your campaign map, as it will remain there going forward.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Wind Speed</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Seafaring Throw</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Save Fails</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Save Succeeds</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Gentle</td>\n<td>+15</td>\n<td>1d4+4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Moderate</td>\n<td>+10</td>\n<td>1d4+4 x 5</td>\n<td>1d2+2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Strong</td>\n<td>+5</td>\n<td>1d4 +4 x 10</td>\n<td>1d4+4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Very Strong</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td>1d4+4 x 20</td>\n<td>1d4+4 x 2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Gale</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>1d4+4 x 50</td>\n<td>1d4+4 x 5</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Rogue Wave:</strong> A sudden and unexpected swell of water threatens to slam into the vessel, possibly capsizing it. Treat the rogue wave as a <em>capsizing wave</em> spell, but modify the damage and saving throw as shown based on wind conditions. Provided the captain succeeds on his Seafaring saving throw, the vessel cannot lose more than 25% of its SHP to this encounter. Re-roll this encounter if the wind speed is Still.</p>\n<p><strong>Rough Conditions:</strong> The water is choppy and rough, and the wind is ever-shifting. There is no particular challenge that can be overcome nor is there any danger or hazard that can be bypassed, it simply is just rough going. All speeds are reduced by 1/2 in this hex.</p>\n<p><strong>Unpredictable Weather:</strong> Nothing is as unpredictable as the weather at sea. When this encounter occurs, immediately re-roll the day’s weather, including temperature, precipitation, wind strength, and wind direction.</p>\n<p><strong>Water Spoilage:</strong> Leaky caskets, fouled water, or some other accident or negligence causes the vessel to lose 2d10% of its stored water. The crew considers this a morale calamity.</p>\n<p><strong>Wear-and-Tear:</strong> The vessel takes 1 structural bludgeoning damage from the wear-and-tear of salt water, waves, and winds. This damage cannot be repaired at sea but can be repaired if the ship beaches/docks. Note that this encounter is much more dangerous to small vessels with low SHP!</p>\n<p><strong>Double:</strong> Roll twice on this table. If either or both rolls are &#39;double&#39;, again, roll on Unique Terrain instead. If neither reroll is &#39;double&#39;, the vessel runs into both indicated dangerous nautical encounters.</p>\n"

The statue is large enough to stretch to the sea floor below, while its highest point (head, trident, tentacle, or other feature) juts out from the waterline by 2d6 x 10’. If the colossal statue appears along a trade route, then it has only recently emerged in the last 1d3 days due to tectonic movement of the seabed, and its exposed portions will be covered by strands of kelp and seaweed. Mark down the location of the colossal statue on your campaign map, as it will remain there going forward.</p>\n<p>The appearance, magical powers, and significance of the statue is left to the Judge’s discretion. It could be anything from a curiosity to a dungeon crawl into the depths. In the Auran Empire campaign setting, roll 1d6 to determine which god the statue represents: 1-3 it’s Naurivus, Empyrean god of the high seas; 4-6 it’s Lammala, Chthonic god of the oceanic abyss. In either case, such a colossus could only have been built before the apocalyptic Day Without Night.</p>\n<p><strong>Damned Mariners:</strong> A mysterious vessel with tattered sails becomes visible on the horizon. Roll 1d10+5 on the Vessels sub-table to determine the type of vessel. However, this is no ordinary vessel – this is a ship crewed by the damned! Each mariner and marine is a <strong>haugbui</strong> while the navigator is a <strong>7HD draugr</strong> and the captain is <strong>9 HD</strong> <strong>draugr</strong>. (You can substitute other undead if desired.) The ship has lost 2d10% of its SHP to battle damage, monster attack, weather, or other causes, but this does not reduce its movement while the undead crew it. The damned crew are automatically hostile and will attempt to intercept the party’s vessel and board it.</p>\n<p>Treat the ship of the damned as the draugr’s barrow for all purposes; once the ship of the damned has grappled the party’s vessel, the party’s vessel is part of the barrow. If everyone on board the party’s vessel is slain or fled, the slain crew rise as haugbui under the command of the draugr. If among the slain crew there were leveled characters of 7th level or more, then the two highest level characters rise as draugr rather than haugbui. The damnation spreads...</p>\n<p>The ship as a whole is a blighted sinkhole of evil, which can only be purged by scuttling it. The ship of the damned will be laden with treasure – roll twice for treasure type Q.</p>\n<p><strong>Deafening Mist:</strong> The air falls still and mist suddenly shrouds the vessel. But this is no ordinary mist – it not only creates Foggy weather conditions that reduce visibility to just 20’, it also deadens all sound. All characters are considered <strong>deafened</strong> while in the mist. Does something lurk in this silent shroud? Maybe! Roll for an additional random encounter, treating a civilized encounter as no encounter. After resolving the encounter (if any), the vessel emerges from the mist one hour later, having traveled at its voyage speed in a random hex direction. The navigator must make an additional Navigation proficiency throw at a -4 penalty to avoid being lost with a -4 penalty.</p>\n<p><strong>Ghost Ship:</strong> The vessel spots a derelict drifting in the water. Roll 1d20 on the Vessels sub-table to determine the type of vessel. The vessel has lost 5d10% of its SHP to battle damage, monster attack, weather, or other causes. However, unlike an ordinary derelict, the vessel is a ghost ship. All of the mariners and marines are <strong>haunts</strong> confined to the vessel in endless repetition of the tasks they were doing just before death. The vessel as a whole is a shadowed sinkhole of evil. If the haunts are destroyed, the ship can be salvaged and its cargo claimed. For every 5 haunts, roll once on Treasure Type A.</p>\n<p><strong>Leviathan:</strong> A monstrous leviathan of some sort dwells in the depths. Roll a sea monster encounter to determine the type of leviathan, re-rolling any humanoids. If the encounter includes multiple monsters, only one of them is the leviathan, and it leads the others. The leviathan is always in a lair - even if its type does not normally make lairs. If the leviathan has less than 20 HD, increase its HD to 20 as a result of the powers it has been infused with. For each HD of increase, the leviathan’s AC improves by 1 and it deals an average of 2 hp more damage divided among all its attacks. Increase the monster&#39;s size by one category, to a minimum of Huge. If already Colossal, increase its HD by (another) 4 instead. If its alignment is Lawful or Neutral, change it to Chaotic. The leviathan’s lair is a shadowed sinkhole of evil. If it is slain, the sinkhole of evil will disperse in 1d4 days. The creature rarely goes far from its lair, but considers any vessels which traverse the vicinity to be prey. The lair will have normal treasure for the monster’s type, plus additional treasure type O. Mark down the location of the leviathan’s lair on your campaign map, as it will remain there going forward.</p>\n<p><strong>Magical Resource:</strong> The vessel comes upon a naturally-occurring magical resource worth 3d6 x 1,000gp. The resource might be eldritch coral, magic kelp, mana-infused fish, etc. Roll on the encounter table to find out what creature it counts as a component from. The magical resource does not require metamphora to store. It weighs 1 stone per 10 gp value. It takes one character an hour (one ancillary activity) to harvest 1,000gp worth of resources. Mark down the location of the magical resource on your campaign map, as it will remain there going forward. If the vessel returns later to the magical resource, they will find that more has grown; you can assign a growth rate (a reasonable average is approximately 33 months to restore the full amount) or reroll its value.</p>\n<p><strong>Marine Formation:</strong> The vessel comes upon marine formation of sublime beauty and vast extent. It could be a blue hole, a colorful coral reef, a kelp forest, an underwater waterfall, a seamount, etc. The marine formation has a 25% chance of also being a well of elemental water; roll on the table below for power. The marine formation has a 50% chance of being occupied by sea creatures; roll for a Sea Monster encounter and place a monster lair in the marine formation. Mark the location of the marine formation on your campaign map, as it will remain there going forward.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Roll (1d6)</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Treasure Type</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Average Value</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>1</strong></td>\n<td>K</td>\n<td>5,000 gp average value</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>2</strong></td>\n<td>L, J</td>\n<td>10,000 gp average value</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>3</strong></td>\n<td>P</td>\n<td>17,000 gp average value</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>4</strong></td>\n<td>Q</td>\n<td>22,000 gp average value</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>5</strong></td>\n<td>Ox2</td>\n<td>24,000 gp average value</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>6</strong></td>\n<td>Q, N</td>\n<td>31,000 gp average value</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Message in a Bottle:</strong> The vessel spots a sealed bottle floating in the water. If the bottle is recovered and opened, it reveals a message within. The exact nature of the message is left to your discretion but often such messages contain cryptic hints to the location of a valuable buried treasure. Roll 1d6 to determine the treasure type the message points to. The treasure is 1 hex away per 1,000 gp value (you can use the average value and roll the actual contents of the treasure later).</p>\n<p><strong>Place of Power:</strong> The vessel travels over or through a place of power of some kind. Roll to determine the type and power. The existence of the place of power will be evident from observable phenomena, such as strange swirling air currents, smoky water from subterranean vents, a huge blue hole in the sea floor, etc. Mark down the location of the place of power on your campaign map, as it will remain there going forward.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Type (1d10)</strong></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>1</strong></td>\n<td>Sinkhole of evil</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>2</strong></td>\n<td>Pinnacle of good</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>3</strong></td>\n<td>Aerie of elemental air</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>4</strong></td>\n<td>Edifice of elemental earth</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>5</strong></td>\n<td>Furnace of elemental fire</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>6-10</strong></td>\n<td>Well of elemental water</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Power (1d12)</strong></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>1-11</strong></td>\n<td>Minor</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>12</strong></td>\n<td>Roll again on the Major Power Table</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Major Power (1d12)</strong></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>1-11</strong></td>\n<td>Major</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>12</strong></td>\n<td>Supreme</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Portal:</strong> The vessel discovers a portal linking two locations. The portal might transfer only sensory information (sight and/or sound), or might allow travel through it. The portal might be always active, or might be limited in some fashion (such as functioning only during an eclipse). A portal that allows travel is always limited in some fashion (though a portal might be always active for sight and/or sound, but allow travel only in limited circumstances). You should choose a location for the other end of the portal that is appropriate for your setting. Note that the two ends of the portal can have different conditions for when they activate – for instance, one end could activate during a lunar eclipse while the other end activates during a solar eclipse – and the other end is not guaranteed to be a safe destination, making travel through an unknown portal extremely dangerous. At your discretion, the portal link might manifest in other ways than an actual portal (such as treating the two locations as the same for the purposes of spellcasting range). Mark down the location of the portals on your campaign map, as they will remain there going forward.</p>\n<p><strong>Sunken Treasure Ship:</strong> The vessel spots a shipwreck visible 100’ + 1d6 x 10’ below. If the vessel is currently in deeper water, then the shipwreck is on an atoll, coral reef, seamount, or similar structure. Roll 1d20 on the Vessels sub-table to determine the type of shipwreck. The shipwreck will contain treasure equal to its maximum capacity. Roll 1d100. On 1-90, the treasure is common metal ingots (such as bronze, copper, iron, lead, or tin) worth 2gp per stone. On 90-99, the treasure is 90% common metal ingots and 10% of the cargo is precious metal ingots (such as electrum, gold, platinum, silver, or tumbaga) worth 100gp per stone. On 100, the treasure is entirely precious metal ingots. A sunken treasure ship has a 75% chance to be the lair of a monster. Roll on the Sea Monster table.</p>\n<p><strong>Truly Unique:</strong> The vessel discovers something truly unique. This category is a catch-all for anything you want to place in the hex (for instance, something you saw in a third-party product and thought was awesome). If you (justifiably) feel that the point of a random table is to keep from having to invent things whole cloth like this, choose another result or reroll!</p>\n<p><strong>Double:</strong> Roll twice and combine the results, which may be a single terrain feature with two powers or two different terrain features, at your discretion. If the result is rolled again, ignore it and reroll (there cannot be more than two Unique effects in a hex).</p>\n"

  "rawMarkdown": "## Sea Voyages\n\nAdventures on the high seas are called voyages and can challenge the characters with lacerating weather, sea monsters, and enemy vessels. Sea voyages are common in the mid- and high-levels of play but can happen earlier if the campaign is focused on nautical action.\n\n### Sequence of Play (Sea Voyages)\n\nDuring a sea voyage, gameplay is handled in increments of **game days** and **hours**. Each game day, the adventurers can undertake 1 dedicated activity (8 hours) and 4 ancillary activities (1 hour each).\n\n1. **Determine Weather:** Determine the wind strength and wind direction (***ACKS II RR***, p. XX). Optionally, determine overall weather conditions. Weather conditions such as Frigid, Foggy, Rainy, Stormy, Windy, etc. can apply penalties to certain activities.\n2. **Check for Starvation, Dehydration, and Scurvy:** Check to see if any creatures on the voyage are starving, dehydrated, or scurvy. If so, starving creatures lose 1 CON and dehydrated creatures lose 1d6 CON (or 2d6 CON if weather conditions are Sweltering). Scurvy characters lose 1 STR and 1 CON immediately and another point of STR and CON each week thereafter during this step.\n3. **Determine Activities:** Ask the party what dedicated and/or ancillary activities it plans to undertake. Usually this will simply be traveling.\n4. **Check for Daily Encounters:** If the vessel is under anchor or the crew will be fishing, roll to see if any random encounters will occur that day. If a random encounter will occur, roll 1d12 to determine the hour of its occurrence.\n5. **Check if the Vessel is Lost:** If the vessel is moving, check to see if it stays on course (***ACKS II RR***, p. XX). If it gets lost, determine the direction they will erroneously be sailing.\n6. **Adjudicate Each Hour:** Each of the 12 adventuring hours in the day, follow the steps below.\n   1. *Determine Direction of Sail:* Ask the captain of the vessel what direction the vessel is sailing.\n   2. *Determine Maximum Vessel Speed:* Determine the vessel’s maximum speed for the hour based on its direction, the wind direction, and the wind strength.\n   3. *Determine Actual Vessel Speed:* Ask the captain of the vessel the actual speed. (Sometimes the captain might want to sail at less than maximum speed so as not to overshoot a destination.)\n   4. *Adjudicate Special Activities:* If the party is undertaking any activities this hour, adjudicate them now.\n   5. *Adjudicate Movement:* Adjust the vessel’s position on your nautical map based on one hour of travel at its chosen speed in the appropriate direction. If this causes the party to enter a new hex, roll to see if a random encounter occurs. If an encounter occurs, follow the encounter procedure (described below).\n   6. *Adjudicate Weather Effects.* If weather conditions are Frigid, check to see if any creature becomes hypothermic either from cold water or lack of protective clothing. Each hypothermic creature loses 1d3 CON now. If weather conditions are Sweltering, check to see if any creatures in heavy armor become fatigued now.\n7. **Resolve Fishing:** If any adventurers or crew have been fishing, roll to see if they caught fish. If so, add the fish to their available supplies of rations.\n8. **Consume Rations:** Mark off no, half, or full food rations and no, half, or full water rations for each creature on the journey.\n   1. If any underfed creature eats a full ration of food, the condition ends.\n   2. If any starving creature eats a full ration of food, the condition ends and the creature becomes underfed.\n   3. If any dehydrated creature drinks a full ration of water, the condition ends.\n   4. If any creature has gone 2 consecutive days without food, or 5 consecutive days with half rations, it becomes underfed.\n   5. If any creature has been underfed for 5 days with no food, or for 10 days with an average of half rations, it becomes starving.\n   6. If any creature has gone a day without water, or 2 days with half water, it becomes dehydrated.\n9. **Adjudicate Weather Effects:** Follow the steps below to resolve any additional weather effects.\n   1. *Disease:* If any creature has suffered seven consecutive days of Frigid or Rainy weather, check to see if it catches a disease (10% chance). If so, resolve the disease using the rules on p. XX.\n   2. *Hypothermia:* If any creature on the expedition was hypothermic or suffered cold damage in Frigid temperatures, check to see if they suffer Frostbite. If so, resolve its effects.\n   3. *Snow:* If conditions were Flurry for three consecutive days or Snowy today, terrain becomes Snowy. If conditions were Sweltering today, or Mild for the past seven days, the snow melts.\n   4. *Sunburn:* If conditions were Sunbaked today, creatures that lacked protective clothing take 1 fire damage.\n10. **Adjudicate Fatigue**: Check to see if any creatures on the expedition has undertaken six consecutive days of strenuous activity (or the equivalent thereof by force marching). If so, it becomes fatigued (***ACKS II*** *RR,* p. XX).\n11. **Adjudicate Healing**: If any characters rested, they heal 1d3 hit points, or 2d3 hit points if under the care of a healer.\n12. **Assess Nighttime Situation**: If the vessel is anchoring at night, roll to see if any random encounters will occur that night. If a random encounter will occur, roll 1d12 to determine the hour of its occurrence and resolve it at that time. If under sail or oar, revert to step 1 and run 12 hours of nighttime travel.\n13. **Advance Calendar:** Mark off 1 day of game time.\n\nDo not feel strictly beholden to this sequence. Sometimes, to adjudicate the action, you’ll need to adjust the sequence of events, other times disregard it altogether. The sequence of play is just intended as a checklist, not a mandate from heaven.\n\n### Encounters at Sea\n\nLike wilderness expeditions, sea voyages can confront adventurers with dangerous monsters, hazardous terrain, and more.\n\n#### Frequency of Encounter Throws\n\nThe frequency of sea encounter throws is determined by the activities of the vessel and the classification of the territory. For purposes of encounters, sea territory can be classified as follows:\n\n* Sea hexes within 6 miles (1 hex) of shoreland have the same territory classification of the shoreland.\n* Sea hexes more than 6 miles but less than 24 miles (4 hexes) from shore reduce the territory classification of the shoreland by one step (e.g. from civilized to borderlands).\n* All other sea hexes count as unsettled.\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Activity** | **Civilized** | **Borderlands** | **Outlands** | **Unsettled** |\n| Anchored/Beached (day) | None | None | None | Once per 12 hours |\n| Anchored/Beached (night) | Once per 7 nights | Once per 3 nights | Once per 12 hours | Once per 12 hours |\n| Fishing | Once per attempt | Once per attempt | Once per attempt | Once per attempt |\n| Searching | Once per hour | Once per hour | Once per hour | Once per hour |\n| Sailing/Rowing | Once per 24-mile hex | Once per 24-mile hex | Once per 24-mile hex | Once per 24-mile hex |\n| Sailing/Rowing (trade route) | Once per 6-mile hex | Once per 6-mile hex | Once per 6-mile hex | Once per 6-mile hex |\n\n#### Making Sea Encounter Throws\n\nTo make a sea encounter throw, follow these steps:\n\n1. Roll 1d20 on the appropriate column of the Sea Encounters by Territory Classification table.\n2. If the roll indicates a “Column Shift, Roll Again” result, shift one column right on the Sea Encounters by Territory Classifications table and roll again.\n3. If the roll indicates a “No Encounter” result, there is no encounter.\n4. If the roll indicates a “Civilized Encounter” result, roll 1d100 on the Civilized Encounter by Territory Classification table to find the type of creature encountered.\n5. If the roll indicates a “Monster Encounter” result:\n   1. Roll 1d20 on the Monster Rarity by Territory Classification table and consult the resulting sub-table for the terrain type.\n   2. Roll 1d100 on the appropriate Monster Encounter by Terrain Type and Rarity to find the type of creature encountered.\n6. If creatures have been encountered in steps 4 or 5:\n   1. Find the encountered creature’s entry in the ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual***and roll against its **Lair** characteristic to determine whether the creature is in its lair. (If the creature is in its lair, a **dynamic lair** can be used if one is available).\n   2. Roll the appropriate **number encountered** for the creature to determine how many are present.\n   3. Follow the rules for Sea Encounter Distance to determine the distance in feet at the start of the encounter. If the creature is in its lair, the encounter distance is the distance to the lair. (If the lair is underwater, the depth counts as additional distance). If the creature is outside its lair, the encounter distance is the distance to the creature.\n   4. Check for surprise and evasion, where necessary, and then proceed to reactions or combat.\n7. If the roll indicates a “Nautical Encounter” result, treat it as a result of “No Encounter” if the party is anchored/beached or is following a known or previously-charted route. Otherwise, roll 1d12 on the appropriate Nautical Encounter sub-table to determine the nature of the encounter.\n\nThe results of rolls on the Sea Encounter tables and sub-tables should always be handled in a fashion that makes sense in the context of the terrain, weather, time of year, and other factors. If necessary to maintain the verisimilitude of the setting, disregard the result and roll again.\n\n#### Sea Encounter by Territory Classification\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Civilized +**  **Trade Route** | **Civilized or Borderlands**  **+ Trade Route** | **Borderlands or**  **Outlands + Trade Route** | **Outlands or**  **Unsettled +**  **Trade Route** | **Unsettled** |\n| Column Shift, Roll Again | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | **-** |\n| No Encounter | 2 - 13 | 2 – 12 | 2 – 12 | 2 – 11 | 1 – 10 |\n| Civilized Encounter | 14 - 20 | 13 – 18 | 13 – 16 | 12 - 14 | - |\n| Monster Encounter | - | 19 | 17 – 19 | 15 – 18 | 11 – 17 |\n| Nautical Encounter | - | 20 | 20 | 19 - 20 | 18 - 20 |\n\nRoll 1d20 on the appropriate column of the Sea Encounters by Territory Classification table. If the party is traveling along a trade route, be sure to use the “+ Trade Route” column for the territory class. If the party is sailing at night in civilized, borderlands, or outlands territory, shift one column to the right.\n\n#### Sea Civilized Encounters\n\nRoll 1d100 on the Sea Civilized Encounter by Territory Classification table to find the type of creature encountered.\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Die Roll**  **(1d100)** | **Civilized** | **Borderlands** | **Outlands** | **Unsettled** |\n| **Die Roll**  **(1d100)** | Man, Commoner (fishers) | Man, Commoner (fishers) | Man, Commoner (fishers) | Man, Commoner (fishers) |\n| 01-05 | Man, Commoner (fishers) | Man, Commoner (fishers) | Man, Commoner (fishers) | Man, Commoner (fishers) |\n| 06-10 | Man, Commoner (fishers) | Man, Commoner (fishers) | Man, Commoner (fishers) | Man, Commoner (fishers) |\n| 11-15 | Man, Commoner (fishers) | Man, Commoner (fishers) | Man, Commoner (fishers) | Man, Commoner (fishers) |\n| 16-20 | Man, Commoner (fishers) | Man, Commoner (fishers) | Man, Commoner (fishers) | Man, Merchant Mariner |\n| 21-25 | Man, Commoner (fishers) | Man, Commoner (fishers) | Man, Commoner (fishers) | Man, Merchant Mariner |\n| 26-30 | Man, Commoner (fishers) | Man, Commoner (fishers) | Man, Commoner (fishers) | Man, Merchant Mariner |\n| 31-35 | Man, Merchant Mariner | Man, Commoner (fishers) | Man, Commoner (fishers) | Man, Merchant Mariner |\n| 36-40 | Man, Merchant Mariner | Man, Merchant Mariner | Man, Commoner (fishers) | Man, Merchant Mariner |\n| 41-45 | Man, Merchant Mariner | Man, Merchant Mariner | Man, Merchant Mariner | Man, Merchant Mariner |\n| 46-50 | Man, Merchant Mariner | Man, Merchant Mariner | Man, Merchant Mariner | Man, Merchant Mariner |\n| 51-55 | Man, Merchant Mariner | Man, Merchant Mariner | Man, Merchant Mariner | Man, Merchant Mariner |\n| 56-60 | Man, Merchant Mariner | Man, Merchant Mariner | Man, Merchant Mariner | Man, Naval Mariner |\n| 61-65 | Man, Merchant Mariner | Man, Merchant Mariner | Man, Merchant Mariner | Man, Naval Mariner |\n| 66-70 | Man, Merchant Mariner | Man, Merchant Mariner | Man, Merchant Mariner | Man, Pirate |\n| 71-75 | Man, Merchant Mariner | Man, Merchant Mariner | Man, Merchant Mariner | Man, Pirate |\n| 76-80 | Man, Naval Mariner | Man, Naval Mariner | Man, Naval Mariner | Man, Pirate |\n| 81-85 | Man, Pirate | Man, Pirate | Man, Pirate | Man, Pirate |\n| 86-90 | Man, Pirate | Man, Pirate | Man, Pirate | Man, Raider |\n| 91-95 | Man, Raider | Man, Raider | Man, Raider | Man, Raider |\n\n#### Sea Monster Encounters\n\nSea monster encounters can confront the vessel with anything from a pirate fleet to a kraken. The farther the party travels from civilization, the more likely the party is to face rare and dangerous monsters.\n\n###### Sea Monster Rarity by Terrain Classification\n\nRoll 1d20 and cross-reference the result with the territory classification on the Monster Rarity by Terrain Classification table. After determining whether the monster encountered is common, uncommon, rare, or very rare, proceed to the Sea Monster Encounter by Rarity table.\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Dice Roll (d20)** | **Civilized** | **Borderlands** | **Outlands** | **Unsettled** |\n| Common | 1-14 | 1-12 | 1-10 | 1-8 |\n| Uncommon | 15-19 | 13-18 | 11-15 | 9-14 |\n| Rare | 20 | 19-20 | 16-19 | 15-18 |\n| Very Rare | - | - | 20 | 19-20 |\n\n###### Sea Monster Encounters by Rarity\n\nRoll 1d100 and cross-reference the result with the monster rarity on the Sea Monster Encounters by Rarity table. Flyers will be in the air unless at a lair; flyer lairs will be on small and uncharted islets, reefs, shipwrecks., etc.\n\n**Sea Monster Encounters by Rarity**\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Die Roll**  **(1d100)** | **Common** | **Uncommon** | **Rare** | **Very Rare** |\n| 01-05 | Dolphin, Common | Crab, Giant | Elemental, Major Water | Damned Mariners\\* |\n| 06-10 | Dolphin, Common | Devil Ray, Giant | Fish, Giant Sturgeon | Dragon, Sea |\n| 11-15 | Dolphin, Common | Dragonfly, Giant | Griffon | Dragon, Sea |\n| 16-20 | Elemental, Petty Water | Elemental, Minor Water | Hippogriff | Dragon Turtle |\n| 21-25 | Raptor, Small (osprey) | Fish, Giant Catfish | Jellyfish, Giant | Dragon Turtle |\n| 26-30 | Raptor, Small (osprey) | Fish, Giant Piranha | Manticore | Elemental, Supreme Water |\n| 31-35 | Raptor, Med.

Adventurers might discover treasure-laden derelicts, sail through dead waters, or encounter supernatural phenomena.\n\n###### Type of Encounter\n\nThere are three types of nautical encounters – beneficial, detrimental, and unique. The type of nautical encounter that confronts the vessel is determined by rolling 1d12 on the table below.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Nautical Encounter Type (1d12)** | |\n| **1-5** | Beneficial Nautical Encounter |\n| **6-10** | Detrimental Nautical Encounter |\n| **11-12** | Unique Nautical Encounter |\n\nRemember, nautical encounters do not occur if the party is anchored/beached or are following a known or previously-charted route.\n\n###### Depth\n\nWhen necessary to resolve a nautical encounter, the depth of the seafloor can be randomly determined based on the vessel’s distance from shore. Submerged features can only be spotted from the surface to a depth of 120’. (Of course, if you’ve mapped the seafloor of your campaign setting, you can use the values from your map instead. At least one ***ACKS II***Judge is known to have done this.)\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Distance to Shore** | **1-4 Hexes** | **5-8 Hexes** | **9-11 Hexes** | **12+ Hexes** |\n| **Depth** | 2d4 x 50’ | 2d8 x 50’ | 3d6 x 500’ | 3d6 x 1000’ |\n\n###### Vessels\n\nWhen any sub-table result directs a roll for Vessel Type, choose or roll for a result on this table. Rolling 1d20 will yield both commercial and military vessels, while 1d10+5 will yield primarily military vessels.\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Roll** | **Vessel Type** | **Roll** | **Vessel Type** |\n| **1** | Barge, Small | **11** | Galley, 3-Rower |\n| **2** | Barge, Small | **12** | Galley, 4-Rower |\n| **3** | Barge, Large | **13** | Galley, 5-Rower |\n| **4** | Barge, Large | **14** | Galley, 8-Rower |\n| **5** | Barge, Huge | **15** | Longship |\n| **6** | Galley, 1-Rower | **16** | Sailing Ship, Small |\n| **7** | Galley, 1.5-Rower | **17** | Sailing Ship, Small |\n| **8** | Galley, 2-Rower | **18** | Sailing Ship, Large |\n| **9** | Galley, 2.5-Rower | **19** | Sailing Ship, Large |\n| **10** | Galley, 3-Rower | **20** | Sailing Ship, Huge |\n\n###### Treasure Types\n\nWhen any sub-table result directs a roll for Treasure by Terrain, roll using the treasure type indicated by this table.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Territory Classification** | **Treasure Type** |\n| Civilized | L,D |\n| Borderlands | K,C |\n| Outlands | L |\n| Unsettled | O |\n\n###### Beneficial Nautical Encounters\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Beneficial Encounter (1d12)** | |\n| **1** | Castaway |\n| **2** | Derelict |\n| **3** | Favorable Current |\n| **4** | Favorable Winds |\n| **5** | Flotsam |\n| **6** | Good Omen |\n| **7** | Monster Carcass |\n| **8** | Navigational Sign |\n| **9** | Plentiful Fish |\n| **10** | Safe Haven |\n| **11** | Smooth Sailing |\n| **12** | Double |\n\n**Castaway:** The vessel spots a castaway drifting across the water on a canoe, raft, sailboat, or wrecked piece of hull. Generate the castaway using the tables on p. XX – p. XX. The castaway will automatically have a Friendly reactions if rescued. He knows one rumor (probably related to whatever destroyed his vessel) and could be recruited as a henchman.\n\n**Derelict:** The vessel spots a derelict drifting in the water. Roll 1d20 on the Vessels sub-table to determine the type of vessel. The derelict has only 2d4 x 10% of its SHP, the rest having been lost to battle damage, monster attack, weather, or other causes. There is a 25% chance the derelict’s hold will contain cargo equal to its maximum capacity times its percentage of SHP remaining. Roll once on the Random Merchandise table for every 1,000 st to determine the type.\n\nEXAMPLE: The adventurers’ vessel spots a derelict. The Judge rolls 1d20 on the Vessel sub-table and gets a 16, so the derelict is a small sailing ship (75 SHP and 10,000 st cargo capacity). The Judge uses 2d4 x 10% to determine how many structural hit points the derelict has left; he rolls 40%, so the ship has only 30 SHP remaining. Next the Judge checks to see if the derelict is carrying cargo; a roll of 17 on 1d100 says it is. Since it has only 40% of its SHP, it has only 40% of its maximum cargo, or 4,000 st. The Judge rolls for 4 lots of 1,000 st each on the Random Merchandise table.\n\n**Favorable Current:** The vessel benefits from a strong underwater current that helps propel it in its desired direction. The vessel’s speed is increased by 50% in this hex.\n\n**Favored Winds:** The gods of the seas have smiled on the vessel, and it enjoys favorable winds. If the vessel is not running before the wind, shift the wind direction by 30 degrees towards the vessel’s preferred direction. If the vessel is already running before the wind, adjust the wind speed by one step towards strong.\n\n**Flotsam:** The vessel spots cargo floating on the water. The encounter distance to the flotsam is determined as if they were flying creatures. There will be 2d6 lots each of 1,000 st. Roll on the Random Merchandise table for each lot, re-rolling results of common metal, tools, armor & weapons, and precious merchandise.\n\n**Good Omen:** The vessel is blessed with a good omen, such as an albatross flying around the ship, dolphins swimming at the bow, or a rainbow appearing in the sky. The crew is so inspired that it can ignore the next morale calamity that occurs.\n\n**Monster Carcass:** The vessel comes upon the floating carcass of a monster or monsters. Roll on the Monster Encounter table to determine the type of creature(s). The encounter distance to the carcass(es) is determined as if they were flying creatures. The corpse(s) are 1d4 days old. The monster will have salvageable parts as per ***ACKS Lairs & Encounters*** *or* ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual***.\n\n**Navigational Sign:** The navigator benefits from a lighthouse, landmark, or other astronomical or terrain feature that helps keep him on course. If the vessel is currently lost, the navigator learns its actual position. If the vessel is currently on course, the navigator gains a +4 bonus to his next throw to avoid getting lost. Mark down the location of the navigational sign on your campaign map, as it will remain there going forward.\n\n**Plentiful Fish:** The vessel has sailed into a region of water with abundant sea-life. Catching fish is as easy as lowering a line or tossing a net. Even if it does not stop to fish, the vessel gains 4d10 x 2 pounds of standard rations per 20 crew. If the vessel stops, each fisher that spends an ancillary activity fishing can capture 4d10 x 2 lbs of standard rations on a successful Fishing proficiency throw. Remember that 2 pounds of rations are sufficient to feed one person for one day. One week of rations weighs 1 stone. Be sure to mark down the location of plentiful fish on your campaign map, as it will remain there going forward.\n\n**Safe Haven:** The vessel has spotted a safe haven such as a coastal cave or grotto, estuary, fjord or inlet, or hidden cove. It can anchor, beach, or harbor at the safe haven and enjoy protection from inclement weather and spotting by passersby. Do not roll encounter throws while the vessel is in the safe haven. Mark down the location of the safe haven on your campaign map, as it will remain there going forward. However, if the vessel is not within sight of the shore, treat this result as Smooth Sailing.\n\n**Smooth Sailing:** The voyage is going as well as can be expected! The vessel ignores the next sea monster encounter or detrimental nautical encounter that would otherwise occur.\n\n**Double:** Roll twice on this table. If either or both rolls are 'double', again, roll on Unique Nautical Encounters instead. If neither reroll is 'double', the vessel runs into both indicated beneficial nautical encounters.\n\n###### Detrimental Nautical Encounters\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Detrimental Encounter (1d12)** | |\n| **1** | Bad Omen |\n| **2** | Dead Sea |\n| **3** | Food Spoilage |\n| **4** | Mariner Overboard |\n| **5** | Nautical Challenge |\n| **6** | Nautical Hazard |\n| **7** | Rogue Wave |\n| **8** | Rough Conditions |\n| **9** | Unpredictable Weather |\n| **10** | Water Spoilage |\n| **11** | Wear-and-Tear |\n| **12** | Double |\n\n**Bad Omen:** The vessel’s crew is unsettled by a bad omen, such as an albatross getting injured by flying into the rigging, red skies appearing in the morning, or a shark following the ship. Being a superstitious lot, the crew considers this a morale calamity.\n\n**Dead Sea:** The sea here is lifeless. This might be due to natural causes, such as hypoxic or oligotrophic conditions, or it might be due to magical or monstrous activity. The vessel cannot fish in this hex. Mark down the location of the dead sea on your campaign map, as it will remain there going forward.\n\n**Food Spoilage:** Bad packing, mold infection, rat infestation, or some other accident or negligence causes the vessel to lose 2d10% of its stored food. The crew considers this a morale calamity.\n\n**Mariner Overboard:** An NPC on the vessel has fallen from the rigging or been thrown overboard by the ship’s heaving and churning. Roll randomly to determine who has fallen overboard; there is an equal chance of it being any crew or passengers on deck. If not rescued (whether by magic, swimming, throwing a rope, etc.) the NPC will eventually drown. If the NPC is a crew member and no effort is made to rescue him, the remaining crew considers this a morale calamity.\n\n**Nautical Challenge:** Accident, age, inclement weather, or wear-and-tear have caused a deterioration in a critical component of the vessel. Until the problem is fixed, the vessel cannot move at greater than 1/4 speed. Fixing the problem swiftly will require one of the crew to succeed on 1d3 difficult and dangerous proficiency throws. Roll 1d10 on the Challenge Type table to find the exact nature of the challenge. If a nautical challenge occurs during very strong winds (Windy conditions), apply a -4 penalty to the proficiency throw. If a nautical challenge occurs during gale winds (Stormy conditions), apply a -10 penalty. If none of the crew can or does meet the challenge, roll 1d12, adding 4 in Windy conditions and 10 in Stormy conditions. That many hours are lost finding another solution to the challenge. Roll for another encounter throw.\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Challenge Type** | | |\n| **Die Roll** | **Challenge** | **Example Obstacle** |\n| 1 | Balancing Traverse (narrow) | Move outboard to the quarters of a yard to re-secure braces that have come loose |\n| 2 | Balancing Traverse (precarious) | Move outboard to the edge of a yardarm to re-attach lifts that have come loose |\n| 3 | Climbing (easy) | Climb up a moving boom to install or take off sail covers |\n| 4 | Climbing (sheer) | Climb up a main-mast destabilized by loose rigging and re-secure the braces |\n| 5 | Crawling Traverse | Shimmy along underside of a yardarm to re-attach lifts that have come loose |\n| 8 | Rappelling | Rappel down the size of the ship to repair a hole in the hull |\n| 9 | Squeezing | Squeeze through narrow, tangled spaces in ship’s hold to secure shifted cargo |\n| 10 | Swimming | Dive underwater to repair rudder or disentangle the ship from entanglement |\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Hazard** | **Distance from Shore** | | |\n| **Type** | **1- Hex** | **2 - 4 Hexes** | **5+ Hexes** |\n| Kelp Forest | 1-4 | 1-4 | 1 |\n| Rock | 5-8 | 5-7 | 2 |\n| Reef | 9-12 | 8-11 | 3 |\n| Sandbar | 13-15 | 12-13 | 4 |\n| Seamount | - | 14 | 5-10 |\n| Shoal | 16 | 15-16 | 11-16 |\n| Wreck | 17-19 | 17-19 | 17 |\n| Whirlpool | 20 | 19-20 | 18-20 |\n\n**Nautical Hazard:** The hex the vessel has entered contains a nautical hazard. Nautical hazards include underwater or partially submerged rocks, coral reefs, kelp forests, sandbars, seamounts, shoals, sunken wrecks, and whirlpools. Roll 1d20 to determine the nature of the hazard. (Feel free to devise other nautical hazards for your setting!) Unless the hazard is a recent development, characters with Navigation and Seafaring proficiency will know about the hazards on common routes and can simply sail or row around them.\n\nWhen a vessel enters a hex containing a nautical hazard, the captain must make a Seafaring proficiency throw of 11+ (7+ if master mariner). If the vessel is moving at 1/2 speed or less, the captain gains a +4 bonus. If the vessel is a galley or longship, the captain gains +4 if navigating sandbars/shoals. If the throw succeeds, the vessel safely traverses the hex. If the throw fails, the vessel runs into the hazard, suffering the effects described below. The suggestions for spells to escape nautical hazards are just that and are not intended to be an exclusive list of the ways a vessel might benefit from magic.\n\n* *Kelp Forest:*The vessel is entangled in seaweed. It cannot move until it is disentangled. Disentangling the vessel requires 1d4 hours plus an additional hour per 60 tons the vessel weighs. A *disintegrate* or *dominate plants* spell can instantly disentangle the vessel.\n* *Rock/Reef/Seamount/Wreck:*The vessel strikes the hazard below the waterline and suffers 8d10 structural piercing damage. If the vessel was traveling at 1/2 speed or less when it entered the hex, damage is halved.\n* *Sandbar/Shoal:*The vessel runs aground and suffers 4d10 structural bludgeoning damage. If the vessel was traveling at 1/2 speed or less when it entered the hex, damage is halved. The vessel cannot move until it is refloated by high tide in 1d12 hours (Judge’s discretion) or until the vessel is freed from the shoal. The crew can attempt to free the vessel by lightening its load or by rocking it back and forth to dislodge it. Lightening the load grants a cumulative 5% chance the vessel escapes for every 200 st of cargo thrown overboard. Each crew member can unload 33 st of cargo per turn (200 st per hour). Rocking the vessel back and forth requires the entire crew to work at shifting ballast and cargo back and forth through the hold. Rocking the vessel grants a 5% cumulative chance per turn that the vessel escapes, but each time the roll fails the vessel suffers 1d4 structural bludgeoning damage. *Force of impetus* can dislodge the vessel immediately but deals 4d10 structural damage to it. *Earth’s movement* can dislodge the vessel in one turn.\n* *Whirlpool:*The vessel is sucked into a whirling maelstrom of water with spouting upswelling fountains and swirling vortices of depressed water. When the vessel enters the whirlpool, and at the end of each round that it remains in the whirlpool, it suffers 25-40 (1d4+4 x 5) structural bludgeoning damage and each crew member on deck must succeed on a Paralysis saving throw or be thrown overboard and must swim or drown. Swimming proficiencies suffer a -8 penalty in a whirlpool. On the captain’s initiative, he can make a Seafaring proficiency throw to steer out of the whirlpool. The target value is based on the vessel’s speed, as if targeted by a *capsizing wave* (p. XX). If the captain’s proficiency throw succeeds, the vessel escapes. If the captain’s proficiency throw fails, the vessel does not escape that round.\n\nMark down the location of the nautical hazard on your campaign map, as it will remain there going forward.\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Wind Speed** | **Seafaring Throw** | **Save Fails** | **Save Succeeds** |\n| Gentle | +15 | 1d4+4 | - |\n| Moderate | +10 | 1d4+4 x 5 | 1d2+2 |\n| Strong | +5 | 1d4 +4 x 10 | 1d4+4 |\n| Very Strong | +2 | 1d4+4 x 20 | 1d4+4 x 2 |\n| Gale | 0 | 1d4+4 x 50 | 1d4+4 x 5 |\n\n**Rogue Wave:** A sudden and unexpected swell of water threatens to slam into the vessel, possibly capsizing it. Treat the rogue wave as a *capsizing wave* spell, but modify the damage and saving throw as shown based on wind conditions. Provided the captain succeeds on his Seafaring saving throw, the vessel cannot lose more than 25% of its SHP to this encounter. Re-roll this encounter if the wind speed is Still.\n\n**Rough Conditions:** The water is choppy and rough, and the wind is ever-shifting. There is no particular challenge that can be overcome nor is there any danger or hazard that can be bypassed, it simply is just rough going. All speeds are reduced by 1/2 in this hex.\n\n**Unpredictable Weather:** Nothing is as unpredictable as the weather at sea. When this encounter occurs, immediately re-roll the day’s weather, including temperature, precipitation, wind strength, and wind direction.\n\n**Water Spoilage:** Leaky caskets, fouled water, or some other accident or negligence causes the vessel to lose 2d10% of its stored water. The crew considers this a morale calamity.\n\n**Wear-and-Tear:** The vessel takes 1 structural bludgeoning damage from the wear-and-tear of salt water, waves, and winds. This damage cannot be repaired at sea but can be repaired if the ship beaches/docks. Note that this encounter is much more dangerous to small vessels with low SHP!\n\n**Double:** Roll twice on this table. If either or both rolls are 'double', again, roll on Unique Terrain instead. If neither reroll is 'double', the vessel runs into both indicated dangerous nautical encounters.\n\n###### Unique Nautical Encounters\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Unique Encounters (1d12)** | |\n| **1** | Colossal Statue |\n| **2** | Damned Mariners |\n| **3** | Deafening Mist |\n| **4** | Ghost Ship |\n| **5** | Leviathan |\n| **6** | Magical Resource |\n| **7** | Marine Formation |\n| **8** | Message in a Bottle |\n| **9** | Place of Power |\n| **10** | Sunken Treasure Ship |\n| **11** | Truly Unique |\n| **12** | Double |\n\n**Colossal Statue:** A colossal statue of a god of the sea emerges from the water here. The statue is large enough to stretch to the sea floor below, while its highest point (head, trident, tentacle, or other feature) juts out from the waterline by 2d6 x 10’. If the colossal statue appears along a trade route, then it has only recently emerged in the last 1d3 days due to tectonic movement of the seabed, and its exposed portions will be covered by strands of kelp and seaweed. Mark down the location of the colossal statue on your campaign map, as it will remain there going forward.\n\nThe appearance, magical powers, and significance of the statue is left to the Judge’s discretion. It could be anything from a curiosity to a dungeon crawl into the depths. In the Auran Empire campaign setting, roll 1d6 to determine which god the statue represents: 1-3 it’s Naurivus, Empyrean god of the high seas; 4-6 it’s Lammala, Chthonic god of the oceanic abyss. In either case, such a colossus could only have been built before the apocalyptic Day Without Night.\n\n**Damned Mariners:** A mysterious vessel with tattered sails becomes visible on the horizon. Roll 1d10+5 on the Vessels sub-table to determine the type of vessel. However, this is no ordinary vessel – this is a ship crewed by the damned! Each mariner and marine is a **haugbui** while the navigator is a **7HD draugr** and the captain is **9 HD** **draugr**. (You can substitute other undead if desired.) The ship has lost 2d10% of its SHP to battle damage, monster attack, weather, or other causes, but this does not reduce its movement while the undead crew it. The damned crew are automatically hostile and will attempt to intercept the party’s vessel and board it.\n\nTreat the ship of the damned as the draugr’s barrow for all purposes; once the ship of the damned has grappled the party’s vessel, the party’s vessel is part of the barrow. If everyone on board the party’s vessel is slain or fled, the slain crew rise as haugbui under the command of the draugr. If among the slain crew there were leveled characters of 7th level or more, then the two highest level characters rise as draugr rather than haugbui. The damnation spreads...\n\nThe ship as a whole is a blighted sinkhole of evil, which can only be purged by scuttling it. The ship of the damned will be laden with treasure – roll twice for treasure type Q.\n\n**Deafening Mist:** The air falls still and mist suddenly shrouds the vessel. But this is no ordinary mist – it not only creates Foggy weather conditions that reduce visibility to just 20’, it also deadens all sound. All characters are considered **deafened** while in the mist. Does something lurk in this silent shroud? Maybe! Roll for an additional random encounter, treating a civilized encounter as no encounter. After resolving the encounter (if any), the vessel emerges from the mist one hour later, having traveled at its voyage speed in a random hex direction. The navigator must make an additional Navigation proficiency throw at a -4 penalty to avoid being lost with a -4 penalty.\n\n**Ghost Ship:** The vessel spots a derelict drifting in the water. Roll 1d20 on the Vessels sub-table to determine the type of vessel. The vessel has lost 5d10% of its SHP to battle damage, monster attack, weather, or other causes. However, unlike an ordinary derelict, the vessel is a ghost ship. All of the mariners and marines are **haunts** confined to the vessel in endless repetition of the tasks they were doing just before death. The vessel as a whole is a shadowed sinkhole of evil. If the haunts are destroyed, the ship can be salvaged and its cargo claimed. For every 5 haunts, roll once on Treasure Type A.\n\n**Leviathan:** A monstrous leviathan of some sort dwells in the depths. Roll a sea monster encounter to determine the type of leviathan, re-rolling any humanoids. If the encounter includes multiple monsters, only one of them is the leviathan, and it leads the others. The leviathan is always in a lair - even if its type does not normally make lairs. If the leviathan has less than 20 HD, increase its HD to 20 as a result of the powers it has been infused with. For each HD of increase, the leviathan’s AC improves by 1 and it deals an average of 2 hp more damage divided among all its attacks. Increase the monster's size by one category, to a minimum of Huge. If already Colossal, increase its HD by (another) 4 instead. If its alignment is Lawful or Neutral, change it to Chaotic. The leviathan’s lair is a shadowed sinkhole of evil. If it is slain, the sinkhole of evil will disperse in 1d4 days. The creature rarely goes far from its lair, but considers any vessels which traverse the vicinity to be prey. The lair will have normal treasure for the monster’s type, plus additional treasure type O. Mark down the location of the leviathan’s lair on your campaign map, as it will remain there going forward.\n\n**Magical Resource:** The vessel comes upon a naturally-occurring magical resource worth 3d6 x 1,000gp. The resource might be eldritch coral, magic kelp, mana-infused fish, etc. Roll on the encounter table to find out what creature it counts as a component from. The magical resource does not require metamphora to store. It weighs 1 stone per 10 gp value. It takes one character an hour (one ancillary activity) to harvest 1,000gp worth of resources. Mark down the location of the magical resource on your campaign map, as it will remain there going forward. If the vessel returns later to the magical resource, they will find that more has grown; you can assign a growth rate (a reasonable average is approximately 33 months to restore the full amount) or reroll its value.\n\n**Marine Formation:** The vessel comes upon marine formation of sublime beauty and vast extent. It could be a blue hole, a colorful coral reef, a kelp forest, an underwater waterfall, a seamount, etc. The marine formation has a 25% chance of also being a well of elemental water; roll on the table below for power. The marine formation has a 50% chance of being occupied by sea creatures; roll for a Sea Monster encounter and place a monster lair in the marine formation. Mark the location of the marine formation on your campaign map, as it will remain there going forward.\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Roll (1d6)** | **Treasure Type** | **Average Value** |\n| **1** | K | 5,000 gp average value |\n| **2** | L, J | 10,000 gp average value |\n| **3** | P | 17,000 gp average value |\n| **4** | Q | 22,000 gp average value |\n| **5** | Ox2 | 24,000 gp average value |\n| **6** | Q, N | 31,000 gp average value |\n\n**Message in a Bottle:** The vessel spots a sealed bottle floating in the water. If the bottle is recovered and opened, it reveals a message within. The exact nature of the message is left to your discretion but often such messages contain cryptic hints to the location of a valuable buried treasure. Roll 1d6 to determine the treasure type the message points to. The treasure is 1 hex away per 1,000 gp value (you can use the average value and roll the actual contents of the treasure later).\n\n**Place of Power:** The vessel travels over or through a place of power of some kind. Roll to determine the type and power. The existence of the place of power will be evident from observable phenomena, such as strange swirling air currents, smoky water from subterranean vents, a huge blue hole in the sea floor, etc. Mark down the location of the place of power on your campaign map, as it will remain there going forward.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Type (1d10)** | |\n| **1** | Sinkhole of evil |\n| **2** | Pinnacle of good |\n| **3** | Aerie of elemental air |\n| **4** | Edifice of elemental earth |\n| **5** | Furnace of elemental fire |\n| **6-10** | Well of elemental water |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Power (1d12)** | |\n| **1-11** | Minor |\n| **12** | Roll again on the Major Power Table |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Major Power (1d12)** | |\n| **1-11** | Major |\n| **12** | Supreme |\n\n**Portal:** The vessel discovers a portal linking two locations. The portal might transfer only sensory information (sight and/or sound), or might allow travel through it. The portal might be always active, or might be limited in some fashion (such as functioning only during an eclipse). A portal that allows travel is always limited in some fashion (though a portal might be always active for sight and/or sound, but allow travel only in limited circumstances). You should choose a location for the other end of the portal that is appropriate for your setting. Note that the two ends of the portal can have different conditions for when they activate – for instance, one end could activate during a lunar eclipse while the other end activates during a solar eclipse – and the other end is not guaranteed to be a safe destination, making travel through an unknown portal extremely dangerous. At your discretion, the portal link might manifest in other ways than an actual portal (such as treating the two locations as the same for the purposes of spellcasting range). Mark down the location of the portals on your campaign map, as they will remain there going forward.\n\n**Sunken Treasure Ship:** The vessel spots a shipwreck visible 100’ + 1d6 x 10’ below. If the vessel is currently in deeper water, then the shipwreck is on an atoll, coral reef, seamount, or similar structure. Roll 1d20 on the Vessels sub-table to determine the type of shipwreck. The shipwreck will contain treasure equal to its maximum capacity. Roll 1d100. On 1-90, the treasure is common metal ingots (such as bronze, copper, iron, lead, or tin) worth 2gp per stone. On 90-99, the treasure is 90% common metal ingots and 10% of the cargo is precious metal ingots (such as electrum, gold, platinum, silver, or tumbaga) worth 100gp per stone. On 100, the treasure is entirely precious metal ingots. A sunken treasure ship has a 75% chance to be the lair of a monster. Roll on the Sea Monster table.\n\n**Truly Unique:** The vessel discovers something truly unique. This category is a catch-all for anything you want to place in the hex (for instance, something you saw in a third-party product and thought was awesome). If you (justifiably) feel that the point of a random table is to keep from having to invent things whole cloth like this, choose another result or reroll!\n\n**Double:** Roll twice and combine the results, which may be a single terrain feature with two powers or two different terrain features, at your discretion. If the result is rolled again, ignore it and reroll (there cannot be more than two Unique effects in a hex).\n"
