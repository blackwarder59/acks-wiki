For instance, if a <em>cataclysm</em> will destroy a PC’s domain on the 15th day of a month, it might make sense to closely track revenue and expenses per day! We reiterate that the sequence of play is intended to be a framework to help you simulate a living world, not a prison that forces your campaign into absurd situations.</p>\n<h3>Start of Month Stage</h3>\n<p>This stage occurs at the beginning of every game month. It consists of two phases, Random Events and Investment.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Random Events:</strong> During this phase, each PC ruler adjudicates any various random events that might occur. The Random Events phase has the following sub-phases:<ol>\n<li><em>Favors and Duties:</em> Roll for Favors and Duties imposed by NPC lords on PC vassals.</li>\n<li><em>Vagaries of Investment:</em> Roll for Vagaries of Investment for each mercantile investment made by the PCs.</li>\n<li><em>Vagaries of Recruitment:</em> Roll for Vagaries of Recruitment for each domain whose ruler is calling up vassal troops, conscripting peasants, hiring mercenaries from his realm, or levying militia this month.</li>\n<li><em>Event Allocation:</em> For each random event scheduled to occur this month, choose or roll to determine which week it will take place in this month.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Investments:</strong> During this phase, each PC ruler can make agricultural or urban investments or land improvements. Each PC can also make passive investments (see p. XX). Investments that were made during role-play in the prior month also take effect now.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Campaign Activities Stage</h3>\n<p>Most action in an ongoing <em><strong>ACKS</strong></em>campaign happens during the campaign activities stage, which can include dungeon delving, wilderness travel, magical research, and more. Four phases occur during the Campaign Activities phase, during which these events are resolved.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>First Week:</strong> During this phase, each character in the campaign can undertake up to seven days’ worth of campaign activities. There are nine sub-phases in the First Week phase:<ol>\n<li><em>Vagaries of War:</em> Roll for Vagaries of War for each army that has left garrison to undertake a campaign.</li>\n<li><em>Schedule Random Events:</em> For each random event scheduled to occur this week, choose or roll 1d8 to determine which day it will take place on (re-roll or choose on an 8). Random events include those from prior Random Events steps, as well as any events triggered by prior campaign activities, such as the arrival of mercenaries seeking employment, or merchants interested in transactions.</li>\n<li><em>First Day’s Activities:</em> For each domain controlled by a PC or his vassals, make a daily domain encounter throw to see if a vagary of incursion occurs (p. XX). If so, determine the domain encounter. Afterwards, run the day’s activities, which might include dungeon delving (p. XX) or wilderness expeditions (p. XX).</li>\n<li><em>Second Day’s Activities</em>: As above.</li>\n<li><em>Third Day’s Activities</em>: As above.</li>\n<li><em>Fourth Day’s Activities:</em> As above.</li>\n<li><em>Fifth Day’s Activities:</em> As above.</li>\n<li><em>Sixth Day’s Activities:</em> As above.</li>\n<li><em>Seventh Day’s Activities:</em> As above.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Second Week:</strong> As above.</li>\n<li><strong>Third Week:</strong> As above.</li>\n<li><strong>Fourth Week:</strong> As above. (If your campaign calendar has months with five or more weeks, add more phases.)</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>End of Month Stage</h3>\n<p>This stage occurs at the end of every game month. It consists of five phases: Domain Growth, Congregant Growth, Revenue Collection, Expense Payment, and Domain Morale.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Domain Growth:</strong> During this phase, each PC and named NPC ruler’s domain grows as per <em>Growing the Domain</em> in <em><strong>ACKS II</strong></em><em>,</em> p. XX. Note that Domain Growth occurs <em>after</em> revenue collection. The Domain Growth phase has three sub-phases that occur in the following order:<ol>\n<li><em>Adventuring:</em> Determine growth triggered by the ruler’s adventures occurring this game month.</li>\n<li><em>Investment:</em> Determine growth triggered by agricultural or urban investments made this game month.</li>\n<li><em>Random Growth:</em> Determine growth from fortune and misfortune (+1d10! - 1d10!, as modified by domain morale).</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Congregant Growth:</strong> During this phase, each divine spellcaster gains 1d10 + CHA bonus congregants per 1,000gp spent proselytizing during this month’s Campaign Activities stage.</li>\n<li><strong>Revenue Collection:</strong> During this phase, each PC and named NPC ruler collects revenue from his domain and urban settlement. The Revenue Collection phase has seven sub-phases that occur in the following order:<ol>\n<li><em>Domain Revenue:</em> Collect land, service, and tax revenue.</li>\n<li><em>Urban Revenue:</em> Collect urban revenue.</li>\n<li><em>Tribute:</em> Collect tribute from loyal vassals paid last month.</li>\n<li><em>Special Taxes:</em> Collect special tax revenue from loyal vassals on whom the “Tax Demanded” duty was imposed or maintained last month.</li>\n<li><em>Loans:</em> Collect loans from loyal vassals on whom the “Loan Demanded” duty was imposed or maintained last month.</li>\n<li><em>Investment Revenue:</em> Collect revenue from passive investments made or held this month.</li>\n<li><em>Hijink Revenue:</em> Collect tribute from syndicate members who did not undertake a specific hijink adjudicated as a campaign activity.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Expense Payment:</strong> During this phase, each PC and named NPC ruler pays expenses for his domain and settlement. The Expense Payment phase has seven ub-phases that occur in the following order:<ol>\n<li><em>Living Expenses:</em> PC and NPC living expenses are paid, if not previously paid in play.</li>\n<li><em>Hireling Wages:</em> Wages of henchmen, mercenaries, specialists, and other hirelings are paid.</li>\n<li><em>Domain Expenses:</em> Domain expenses are paid.</li>\n<li><em>Settlement Expenses:</em> Settlement expenses are paid.</li>\n<li><em>Tribute:</em> Tributes owed to lords are paid. (Note that lords will collect Tribute, as well as Special Taxes and Loans, during the Revenue Collection phase of the next game month.)</li>\n<li><em>Special Taxes:</em> Special tax revenue is paid if a “Tax Demanded” duty was imposed or maintained on the PC this month.</li>\n<li><em>Loans:</em> Loans are paid if a “Loan Demanded” duty was imposed or maintained on the PC last month.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>A ruler may opt to leave one or more expenses unpaid, suffering the appropriate in-game consequences from doing so.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Domain Morale:</strong> During this sub-phase, resolve domain morale rolls and other game mechanics that relate to domain morale. Starting with the domain with the lowest current morale score, make a domain morale roll for each domain with a PC or named NPC ruler, applying any modifiers based on taxes, liturgies, campaign activities, etc. and notes down any effects.</li>\n</ol>\n",
