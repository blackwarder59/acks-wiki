  "html": "<h2>Step 7: Place Traps</h2>\n<p>Traps include deadfalls, spiked pits, poisoned needles in door handles, and other obstacles intended to harm, capture, or delay dungeon explorers. A trap is defined by its location, its trigger, its level, and its effects.</p>\n<h3>Trap Locations</h3>\n<p>When determining the location of traps, you should consider their proximity to entryways, chokepoints, key intersections, and other factors. Unless the dungeon is a “fun house” made by some mad mage, traps should be placed with a purpose, such as protecting an area, interdicting a passage, raising an alarm, and so on.</p>\n<h3>Trap Trigger Mechanisms</h3>\n<p>When you place a trap in a dungeon, you must decide how the trap is triggered. A trap might have a magical or mechanical trigger or even a combination of both. Some examples of trap triggers are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>*Counterweights:*A system of weights that shifts when an object is removed or added, triggering a trap, such as a dart trap or a portcullis slamming down.</li>\n<li><em>Gear Systems:</em> Complex arrangements of gears that interact when a specific action is taken, such as turning a key or solving a puzzle, which in turn triggers a trap.</li>\n<li><em>Hidden Buttons:</em> Small buttons hidden in plain sight or disguised as part of the scenery that, when pressed, activate a trap, such as a wall of spikes or a sudden gust of wind.</li>\n<li><em>Levers and Pulleys:</em> Hidden or disguised levers that, when pulled, trigger a trap, such as a collapsing floor or a flood of water.</li>\n<li><em>Pivoting Floor Tiles:</em> Tiles that rotate when stepped on, causing the character to fall into a hidden pit or releasing a hidden mechanism.</li>\n<li><em>Pressure plates:</em> Plates that, when stepped on, depress and activate a connected mechanism, such as releasing a projectile or opening a hidden door.</li>\n<li><em>Proximity Triggers:</em> Devices that react to the presence of heat, sound, or movement, such as a brazier that ignites a flammable gas or a chime that summons guardians.</li>\n<li><em>Runes:</em> Magical symbols that trigger a trap when touched or activated by a specific action, such as casting a spell or speaking a command word.</li>\n<li><em>Tripwires:</em> Thin wires or ropes stretched across a path or doorway that, when tripped over, activate a trap, such as releasing a swinging log or dropping a net.</li>\n<li><em>Weight-Sensitive Platforms:</em> Platforms that activate a trap when a specific weight is applied, such as a boulder rolling down a slope or a retracting bridge.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When an adventurer takes an action that might (but not necessarily will) activate a trap, such as walking down a corridor with a tripwire, you secretly roll 1d6. On a roll of 1-2, the adventurer has accidentally activated the trap. On a roll of 3-6, the adventurer has accidentally missed the trap entirely and it remains inactivated. (You can adjust the range of success if the trap is particularly hard or easy to set off.) Depending on the location of the trigger, the party’s formation, and the vagaries of chance, you might secretly roll many times before a hapless adventurer sets off a trap! Some traps can be accidentally activated by probing with a 10’ pole; in that case the pole is treated as an adventurer moving 5’ ahead of its bearer for purposes of activation.</p>\n<h6>Crude Traps</h6>\n<p>Some traps are crudely constructed with simple or jury-rigged mechanisms. These function similarly to ordinary traps, but are easier to spot and less effective. All characters gain a +4 bonus to find and remove crude traps. If a crude trap triggers an attack, it attacks with a -2 penalty. If a crude trap grants a saving throw, the target saves with a +2 bonus. Once set, a crude trap must be maintained, which requires one hour’s worth of maintenance per day. If unmaintained it ceases functioning.</p>\n<h3>Trap Level</h3>\n<p>Like dungeons and spells, traps are rated in levels (1st – 6th). The level of a trap has two meanings. First, it indicates what level of a dungeon the trap is likely to appear on. For instance, the 1st level of a dungeon typically has 1st level traps. Second, it indicates the dangerousness of the trap relative to a divine spell of the same level when cast at minimum caster level. For instance, a 3rd level trap should be approximately as dangerous as a 3rd level divine spell cast by a 5th level caster.</p>\n<p>Magical traps can simply trigger the desired spell, but non-magical traps should approximate the effect of a spell through mechanical means – ignition of flammable gases, release of darts, and so on. The comparison to spell level is intended as a guideline to appropriate areas of effect, attack throws, saving throws, and damage for mechanical traps, not an invitation to give miraculous powers to trappers.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: The Judge is placing a trap on Level 1 of a dungeon. He decides that the trap’s trigger is a pressure plate that, when stepped on, triggers a blast of burning naphtha. How powerful should the naphtha blast be? Since it’s being placed on Level 1 of a dungeon, it should be about as powerful as a 1st level arcane spell. <strong>Fan of flames</strong> is a 1st level spell that deals 1d4 fire damage to all creatures within a 40’ x 20’ cone, or half that on a successful Blast save. <strong>Fireball</strong> is a 3rd level spell that deals 5d6 damage to all creatures in a 20’ diameter, half that on a successful Blast save. His naphtha trap should do damage that’s equal to or less than the damage from <strong>fan of flames</strong>, not <strong>fireball</strong>.</p>\n<h3>Trap Effects</h3>\n<p>Thes effects of a trap can range from damaging attacks to area effects that require a saving throw to avoid or mitigate. The traps below are examples of classic traps with common mechanisms. Do not be afraid to concoct your own fiendish traps in addition to these! The suggestions below range from 1st to 6th level. Remember that more challenging dungeons should have deadlier traps.</p>\n<h6>Ceiling Collapse Trap</h6>\n<p>A section of the ceiling is rigged to collapse when triggered, potentially crushing characters underneath with bricks or stones. Each creature in a 10’ radius must make a Blast saving throw. If the save fails, the creature suffers bludgeoning damage from falling bricks or stones. If the save succeeds, the creature suffers half damage.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>1st level:</em> The falling stones deal 1d6 bludgeoning damage.</li>\n<li><em>2nd level</em>: The falling stones deal 3d6 bludgeoning damage.</li>\n<li><em>3rd level</em>: The falling stones deal 5d6 bludgeoning damage.</li>\n<li><em>4th level</em>: The falling stones deal 7d6 bludgeoning damage.</li>\n<li><em>5th level</em>: The falling stones deal 9d6 bludgeoning damage and knock prone any creatures that fail their saves.</li>\n<li><em>6th level</em>: The falling stones deal 11d6+11 bludgeoning damage and knock prone any creatures that fail their saves.</li>\n</ul>\n<h6>Deadfall Trap</h6>\n<p>When triggered, a heavy object falls from overhead tree branches. Each creature in the area of effect must make a Blast saving throw. If the save fails, the creature suffers the listed effect. If the save succeeds, the creature dodges the deadfall.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>1st level:</em> The deadfall deals 1d12 bludgeoning damage to all creatures in a 5’ diameter.</li>\n<li><em>2nd level</em>: The deadfall deals 3d12 bludgeoning damage to all creatures in a 10’ diameter.</li>\n<li><em>3rd level</em>: The deadfall deals 5d12 bludgeoning damage to all creatures in a 10’ diameter.</li>\n<li><em>4th level</em>: The deadfall deals 7d12 bludgeoning damage to and knocks <strong>prone</strong> all creatures in a 10’ diameter.</li>\n<li><em>5th level</em>: The deadfall deals 9d12 bludgeoning damage to and knocks <strong>prone</strong> all creatures in a 10’ diameter.</li>\n<li><em>6th level</em>: The deadfall instantly kills all creatures in a 10’ line.</li>\n</ul>\n<h6>Excavated Earth Pit Trap</h6>\n<p>A 10’ x 10’ hole in the ground is covered with leaves and brush rigged to collapse when triggered by someone walking across it. Creatures on top of the pit when it is triggered fall in, suffering 1d6 bludgeoning damage per 10’. If the pit is spiked, creatures that fall into it are also impaled on 1d4 spikes dealing 1d6 damage each.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>1st level:</em> The pit is 10’ deep.</li>\n<li><em>2nd level</em>: The pit is 20’ deep</li>\n<li><em>3rd level</em>: The pit is 10’ deep with spikes.</li>\n<li><em>4th level</em>: The pit is 20’ deep with spikes.</li>\n<li><em>5th level:</em> The pit is 30’ deep with spikes.</li>\n<li><em>6th level:</em> The pit is 40’ deep with spikes.</li>\n</ul>\n<h6>Fire Trap</h6>\n<p>A hidden canister contains a volume of flammable substance. When triggered, a valve on the canister is opened and the substance is ignited and ejected onto one or more creatures or an area of effect.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>1st level:</em> Flammable oil is sprayed over a 10’ diameter area of floor and ignited. Each creature in the area of effect must make a Blast saving throw. If the save fails, the creature takes 1d8 fire damage immediately and an additional 1d8 fire damage on the following round. If the save succeeds, the creatures 1d4 fire damage.</li>\n<li><em>2nd level:</em> Naphtha is projected in a 40’ long and 20’ wide cone. Each creature in the area of effect must make a Blast saving throw. If the save fails, the creature takes 2d4 fire damage.

The creature in the area of effect must make a Death saving throw. If the save fails, the creature is disintegrated.</li>\n</ul>\n<h6>Missile Trap</h6>\n<p>An arbalest, ballista, bow, crossbow, or dart-thrower in a hidden location is rigged to fire at a target point when triggered. The missile can be magical or poisoned.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>1st level:</em> A crossbow fires one bolt, attacking as a 1st level fighter and dealing 1d6+1 piercing damage.</li>\n<li><em>2nd level:</em> A battery of crossbows fires three bolts, each attacking as a 3rd level fighter and each dealing 1d6+1 piercing damage.</li>\n<li><em>3rd level:</em> A ballista fires one bolt, attacking as a 5th level fighter. If it hits, the target suffers 3d6 piercing damage. If it misses, the bolt scatters to a new target. Thereafter each creature within a 5’ line of the target struck must make Blast saves. If the save fails, the creatures suffer 3d6 piercing damage. If the save succeeds, the creature suffers half that.</li>\n<li>4th <em>level:</em> A crossbow fires one poisoned bolt, attacking as a 7th level fighter for 1d6+1 piercing damage.

The needle can be poisoned.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>1st level</em>: A needle attacks the triggering creature as a 1st level fighter for 1 piercing damage. It is poisoned with cobra venom. If the creature is damaged, it must succeed on a Death save at +2 or suffer 1d6 poisonous damage.</li>\n<li><em>2nd level</em>: A needle attacks the triggering creature as a 3rd level fighter for 1 piercing damage.

The needle is cursed with black magic to slowly sap life energy over a duration of 10 rounds. If the creature is damaged by the needle, it must make a Death save each round at the start of its initiative until the duration elapses. Each time the save fails, the creature instantly loses 1d8 points from its maximum hp. If the creature fails the save even once, it becomes <strong>enervated</strong> at the end of the duration. For purposes of removing the curse, consider it a 6th level spell cast by an 11th level caster.</li>\n</ul>\n<h6>Portcullis Trap</h6>\n<p>A portcullis is hidden above an entryway. When triggered, the portcullis falls suddenly downward. The creature who triggered the trap must make a Blast saving throw. If the save succeeds, the creature can choose on which side of the portcullis it lands.

Alternatively a pressure sensitive trap door, with or without locking mechanism, can trigger the trap when an appropriate weight is on top. Creatures on top of the pit when it is triggered fall in, suffering 1d6 bludgeoning damage per 10’. If the pit is spiked, creatures that fall into it are also impaled on 1d4 spikes dealing 1d6 damage each.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>1st level:</em> The pit is 10’ deep.</li>\n<li><em>2nd level</em>: The pit is 20’ deep</li>\n<li><em>3rd level</em>: The pit is 10’ deep with spikes.</li>\n<li><em>4th level</em>: The pit is 20’ deep with spikes.</li>\n<li><em>5th level:</em> The pit is 30’ deep with spikes.</li>\n<li><em>6th level:</em> The pit is 40’ deep with spikes.</li>\n</ul>\n<h6>Rolling Rock Trap</h6>\n<p>A massive boulder is set to roll down a slope or chute when triggered, crushing anything in its path.

All creatures in the area must then succeed on a second Blast saving throw or suffer 7d8 slashing damage as the scythe swings back.</li>\n<li><em>6th level:</em> Affected creatures suffer 7d8 slashing damage and must immediately roll on the Slashing Mortal Woundstable and suffer the result listed under Permanent Wounds Suffered. When rolling on the table, the only modifiers that apply are those from CON and HD.</li>\n</ul>\n<h6>Spring Snare Trap</h6>\n<p>A snare is connected to a taut branch overhead. When triggered, the snare fastens around the legs of creatures in the snare’s area of effect. Each creature in the area of effect must make Paralysis saving throw. If the save succeeds, the creature avoids the trap. If the save fails, the creature suffers bludgeoning damage, is hoisted into the air, and becomes <strong>restrained</strong> until he escapes or cuts free. When a creature escapes or cuts free, it falls to the ground unless protective measures are taken, suffering an additional 1d6 bludgeoning damage per 10’ of fall.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>1st level:</em> The trap targets a 5’ diameter area, deals 1d6 bludgeoning damage, and hoists the affected creatures 10’ up.</li>\n<li><em>2nd level</em>:The trap targets a 10’ diameter area, deals 2d6 bludgeoning damage, and hoists the affected creatures 20’ up.</li>\n<li><em>3rd level</em>: The trap targets a 20’ diameter area, deals 3d6 bludgeoning damage, and hoists the affected creatures 30’ up.</li>\n<li><em>4th level</em>: The trap targets a 20’ diameter area, deals 4d6 bludgeoning damage, and hoists the affected creatures 40’ up.</li>\n<li><em>5th level</em>: The trap targets a 20’ diameter area, deals 5d6 bludgeoning damage, and hoists the affected creatures 50’ up.</li>\n<li><em>6th level</em>: The trap targets a 25’ diameter area, deals 5d6 bludgeoning damage, and hoists the affected creatures 50’ up.</li>\n</ul>\n<h6>Swinging Log Trap</h6>\n<p>A large log is hidden above an entryway or passage.

  "metadata": {},
  "rawMarkdown": "## Step 7: Place Traps\n\nTraps include deadfalls, spiked pits, poisoned needles in door handles, and other obstacles intended to harm, capture, or delay dungeon explorers. A trap is defined by its location, its trigger, its level, and its effects.\n\n### Trap Locations\n\nWhen determining the location of traps, you should consider their proximity to entryways, chokepoints, key intersections, and other factors. Unless the dungeon is a “fun house” made by some mad mage, traps should be placed with a purpose, such as protecting an area, interdicting a passage, raising an alarm, and so on.\n\n### Trap Trigger Mechanisms\n\nWhen you place a trap in a dungeon, you must decide how the trap is triggered. A trap might have a magical or mechanical trigger or even a combination of both. Some examples of trap triggers are:\n\n* *Counterweights:*A system of weights that shifts when an object is removed or added, triggering a trap, such as a dart trap or a portcullis slamming down.\n* *Gear Systems:* Complex arrangements of gears that interact when a specific action is taken, such as turning a key or solving a puzzle, which in turn triggers a trap.\n* *Hidden Buttons:* Small buttons hidden in plain sight or disguised as part of the scenery that, when pressed, activate a trap, such as a wall of spikes or a sudden gust of wind.\n* *Levers and Pulleys:* Hidden or disguised levers that, when pulled, trigger a trap, such as a collapsing floor or a flood of water.\n* *Pivoting Floor Tiles:* Tiles that rotate when stepped on, causing the character to fall into a hidden pit or releasing a hidden mechanism.\n* *Pressure plates:* Plates that, when stepped on, depress and activate a connected mechanism, such as releasing a projectile or opening a hidden door.\n* *Proximity Triggers:* Devices that react to the presence of heat, sound, or movement, such as a brazier that ignites a flammable gas or a chime that summons guardians.\n* *Runes:* Magical symbols that trigger a trap when touched or activated by a specific action, such as casting a spell or speaking a command word.\n* *Tripwires:* Thin wires or ropes stretched across a path or doorway that, when tripped over, activate a trap, such as releasing a swinging log or dropping a net.\n* *Weight-Sensitive Platforms:* Platforms that activate a trap when a specific weight is applied, such as a boulder rolling down a slope or a retracting bridge.\n\nWhen an adventurer takes an action that might (but not necessarily will) activate a trap, such as walking down a corridor with a tripwire, you secretly roll 1d6. On a roll of 1-2, the adventurer has accidentally activated the trap. On a roll of 3-6, the adventurer has accidentally missed the trap entirely and it remains inactivated. (You can adjust the range of success if the trap is particularly hard or easy to set off.) Depending on the location of the trigger, the party’s formation, and the vagaries of chance, you might secretly roll many times before a hapless adventurer sets off a trap! Some traps can be accidentally activated by probing with a 10’ pole; in that case the pole is treated as an adventurer moving 5’ ahead of its bearer for purposes of activation.\n\n###### Crude Traps\n\nSome traps are crudely constructed with simple or jury-rigged mechanisms. These function similarly to ordinary traps, but are easier to spot and less effective. All characters gain a +4 bonus to find and remove crude traps. If a crude trap triggers an attack, it attacks with a -2 penalty. If a crude trap grants a saving throw, the target saves with a +2 bonus. Once set, a crude trap must be maintained, which requires one hour’s worth of maintenance per day. If unmaintained it ceases functioning.\n\n### Trap Level\n\nLike dungeons and spells, traps are rated in levels (1st – 6th). The level of a trap has two meanings. First, it indicates what level of a dungeon the trap is likely to appear on. For instance, the 1st level of a dungeon typically has 1st level traps. Second, it indicates the dangerousness of the trap relative to a divine spell of the same level when cast at minimum caster level. For instance, a 3rd level trap should be approximately as dangerous as a 3rd level divine spell cast by a 5th level caster.\n\nMagical traps can simply trigger the desired spell, but non-magical traps should approximate the effect of a spell through mechanical means – ignition of flammable gases, release of darts, and so on. The comparison to spell level is intended as a guideline to appropriate areas of effect, attack throws, saving throws, and damage for mechanical traps, not an invitation to give miraculous powers to trappers.\n\nEXAMPLE: The Judge is placing a trap on Level 1 of a dungeon. He decides that the trap’s trigger is a pressure plate that, when stepped on, triggers a blast of burning naphtha. How powerful should the naphtha blast be? Since it’s being placed on Level 1 of a dungeon, it should be about as powerful as a 1st level arcane spell. **Fan of flames** is a 1st level spell that deals 1d4 fire damage to all creatures within a 40’ x 20’ cone, or half that on a successful Blast save. **Fireball** is a 3rd level spell that deals 5d6 damage to all creatures in a 20’ diameter, half that on a successful Blast save. His naphtha trap should do damage that’s equal to or less than the damage from **fan of flames**, not **fireball**.\n\n### Trap Effects\n\nThes effects of a trap can range from damaging attacks to area effects that require a saving throw to avoid or mitigate. The traps below are examples of classic traps with common mechanisms. Do not be afraid to concoct your own fiendish traps in addition to these! The suggestions below range from 1st to 6th level. Remember that more challenging dungeons should have deadlier traps.\n\n###### Ceiling Collapse Trap\n\nA section of the ceiling is rigged to collapse when triggered, potentially crushing characters underneath with bricks or stones. Each creature in a 10’ radius must make a Blast saving throw. If the save fails, the creature suffers bludgeoning damage from falling bricks or stones. If the save succeeds, the creature suffers half damage.\n\n* *1st level:* The falling stones deal 1d6 bludgeoning damage.\n* *2nd level*: The falling stones deal 3d6 bludgeoning damage.\n* *3rd level*: The falling stones deal 5d6 bludgeoning damage.\n* *4th level*: The falling stones deal 7d6 bludgeoning damage.\n* *5th level*: The falling stones deal 9d6 bludgeoning damage and knock prone any creatures that fail their saves.\n* *6th level*: The falling stones deal 11d6+11 bludgeoning damage and knock prone any creatures that fail their saves.\n\n###### Deadfall Trap\n\nWhen triggered, a heavy object falls from overhead tree branches. Each creature in the area of effect must make a Blast saving throw. If the save fails, the creature suffers the listed effect. If the save succeeds, the creature dodges the deadfall.\n\n* *1st level:* The deadfall deals 1d12 bludgeoning damage to all creatures in a 5’ diameter.\n* *2nd level*: The deadfall deals 3d12 bludgeoning damage to all creatures in a 10’ diameter.\n* *3rd level*: The deadfall deals 5d12 bludgeoning damage to all creatures in a 10’ diameter.\n* *4th level*: The deadfall deals 7d12 bludgeoning damage to and knocks **prone** all creatures in a 10’ diameter.\n* *5th level*: The deadfall deals 9d12 bludgeoning damage to and knocks **prone** all creatures in a 10’ diameter.\n* *6th level*: The deadfall instantly kills all creatures in a 10’ line.\n\n###### Excavated Earth Pit Trap\n\nA 10’ x 10’ hole in the ground is covered with leaves and brush rigged to collapse when triggered by someone walking across it. Creatures on top of the pit when it is triggered fall in, suffering 1d6 bludgeoning damage per 10’. If the pit is spiked, creatures that fall into it are also impaled on 1d4 spikes dealing 1d6 damage each.\n\n* *1st level:* The pit is 10’ deep.\n* *2nd level*: The pit is 20’ deep\n* *3rd level*: The pit is 10’ deep with spikes.\n* *4th level*: The pit is 20’ deep with spikes.\n* *5th level:* The pit is 30’ deep with spikes.\n* *6th level:* The pit is 40’ deep with spikes.\n\n###### Fire Trap\n\nA hidden canister contains a volume of flammable substance. When triggered, a valve on the canister is opened and the substance is ignited and ejected onto one or more creatures or an area of effect.\n\n* *1st level:* Flammable oil is sprayed over a 10’ diameter area of floor and ignited. Each creature in the area of effect must make a Blast saving throw. If the save fails, the creature takes 1d8 fire damage immediately and an additional 1d8 fire damage on the following round. If the save succeeds, the creatures 1d4 fire damage.\n* *2nd level:* Naphtha is projected in a 40’ long and 20’ wide cone. Each creature in the area of effect must make a Blast saving throw. If the save fails, the creature takes 2d4 fire damage. If the save succeeds, the creature takes half that damage.\n* *3rd level:* Flammable gas in a 20’ diameter sphere is ignited. Each creature in the area of effect must make a Blast saving throw. If the save fails, the creature takes 5d6 fire damage. If the save succeeds, the creature takes half that damage.\n* *4th level:* Flammable gas in a 20’ diameter sphere is ignited. Each creature in the area of effect must make a Blast saving throw. If the save fails, the creature takes 7d6+7 fire damage. If the save succeeds, the creature takes half that damage.\n* *5th level:* Sticky flammable gas in a 20’ diameter sphere is ignited. Each creature in the area of effect must make a Blast saving throw. If the save fails, the creatures takes 9d6 fire damage and starts **burning** (as per the spell *kindle flame*).\n* *6th level:* Magma pours over a 5’ diameter sphere. The creature in the area of effect must make a Death saving throw.
