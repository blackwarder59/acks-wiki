  "html": "<h2>Halfling Custom Classes</h2>\n<p>Halflings are a race of diminutive and insular humanoids noted for their love of food, wealth, and comfort and their dislike of big people, strangers, and travel. Descending from human and dwarven stock, they stand about 3’ tall, with ruddy skin, dark hair, and brown or black eyes. Among the most hirsute of the humanoid races, halflings cultivate their body hair the way dwarves cultivate their beards. Well-groomed foot hair is the mark of a halfling of fine breeding. Halflings live in small, close-knit communities of hill burrows with big, round windows. These “halfling holes” are a compromise between a dwarven heritage that craves the security of thick earth overhead and a human bloodline clamoring for sun and space.</p>\n<h3>Requirements</h3>\n<p>All halfling classes require a minimum Dexterity 9 or better.</p>\n<h3>Class Category Values</h3>\n<p><strong>Fighting:</strong> Halflings with narrow weapon selections are limited to choosing from the following weapons: bola, dagger, darts, hand axe, javelin, sling, short bow, short sword. Halflings with broad weapon selections can also choose battle axe, crossbow, mace, or sword. (Also see the Undersized racial weakness, below.) Halflings cannot allocate more than 2 points to Fighting.</p>\n<p><strong>Arcane:</strong> Halflings may not allocate points to the Arcane value.</p>\n<h3>Halfling Value</h3>\n<p>When building a halfling custom class, assign between 0 and 4 build points to the class’s Halfling Value. These points represent the degree by which the members of the class embody archetypical halfling characteristics.</p>\n<p><strong>Halfling 0:</strong> At Halfling 0, all halflings gain the following halfling custom powers:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Value</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Halfling</strong></td>\n<td><strong>XP Cost</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>Halfling 4</td>\n<td>-150</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>Halfling 3</td>\n<td>-225</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>Halfling 2</td>\n<td>-300</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>Halfling 1</td>\n<td>-375</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>Halfling 0</td>\n<td>-450</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Child-like:</strong> Any halfling character suffers -2 to loyalty and morale from any non-halfling henchman, but gains +2 to loyalty and morale from any halfling henchman. This does not affect their reaction rolls.</li>\n<li><strong>Demi-human Ancestry:</strong> Due to their dwarven ancestry, halflings gain a +1 bonus on Paralysis and Spells saving throws.</li>\n<li><strong>Difficult to Corrupt:</strong>  Halfling crave comfort and security far to much to be able to descend into dastardly wickedness. They suffer only 1/2 the usual amount of Corruption from spending time in sinkholes of evil (p. XX), using evil magic items (p. XX), or other causes of corruption. (If the campaign does not include corruption, this power has no effect.)</li>\n<li><strong>Easily Encumbered:</strong> Halflings have a normal load of 3 st instead of 5 st. They have a speed of 60’ when carrying 3 1/6 to 4 3/6 st. They have a speed of 45’ when carrying 4 4/6 st to 6 st. They have a speed of 30’ when carrying more than 6 st. A halfling can carry a maximum of 12 stone, modified by his Strength bonus or penalty.</li>\n<li><strong>Halfling Tongues:</strong> All halflings speak the common tongue, their native tongue, and three bonus languages, selected from the following list based on their shire’s proximity to other races and realms: Bugbear, Dwarf, Elf, Gnome, Goblin, Human (various), Hobgoblin, Kobold, Orc.</li>\n<li><strong>Heroic Breakfast:</strong> Once per day a halfling can recover hp by consuming a meal accompanied by alcohol, coffee, or tea. This recovery is equal to the hit points gained from a day of rest, and can be in addition to rest.</li>\n<li><strong>Underfoot:</strong> Because of their small size, halflings can more easily avoid attacks by big, clumsy creatures. Monsters of larger than man-sized suffer a -2 penalty to their attack throws against halflings.</li>\n<li><strong>Short-Statured:</strong> Due to their short stature, halflings have a speed of 90’ when unencumbered. They can never wield large-sized weapons such as arbalests, great axes, morning stars, lances, longbows, polearms, staffs, or two-handed swords, and must use two hands when wielding medium-sized weapons such as battle axes, maces, and swords.</li>\n<li><strong>Weak:</strong> Halflings have a -4 penalty to proficiency throws to Dungeonbashing proficiency throws. In addition, they roll one die size smaller than normal for their Hit Dice (d8 becomes d6; d6 becomes d4; d4 becomes d2).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additional points allocated to the Halfling Value represents the halfling’s expertise in certain specialized skills and abilities that are shared by word of mouth between halfling adventurers, free spirits, and travelers. Each point provides one <strong>halfling skill</strong> selected from the following: Hiding, Listening, Lockpicking, Searching, Sneaking, or Trapbreaking (as thief); Natural Stealth or Evasion (as explorer); or Arcane Dabbling, Beast Friendship, Magical Music, Passing Without Trace, Precise Shooting, Running, Skirmishing, Swashbuckling (as class proficiency); or Placating, a special halfling-only class power.</p>\n<p><strong>Placating:</strong> A halfling may use disarming words, glib talk, or submissive body language to avoid being attacked. A halfling may not attack while placating, but may walk at half speed, or perform an action in lieu of moving, such as standing up from being knocked down, picking an item off the ground, or retrieving an item from a pack or sack. A halfling may not placate if he, or any other halflings in his party, have already attacked an opponent during the present encounter. When a halfling is placating, any opponent attempting to strike or otherwise directly attack the halfling must attempt a saving throw versus Spells. If the save succeeds, the opponent can attack the halfling normally that round. If the save fails, the opponent will not attack the halfling that round and will attack another creature instead. Area effects may still affect the halfling. Mindless creatures and fantastic creatures of animal intelligence cannot be placated, but ordinary animals and all sapient creatures are susceptible to a halfling&#39;s cringing placation.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: The Halfling Burglar is built with class category values of HD 1, Fighting 1b, Thief 2, Halfling 3. The HD 1 value would normally yield 1d6 hp per level, but the Weak class power reduces this to 1d4 hp per level. The Fighting 1b Broad weapon selection is traded down to Narrow weapon selection in exchange for 2 class powers. Therefore the Halfling Burglar receives 2 class powers, 5 thief skills, and 3 halfling skills, for a total of 10 special abilities. As a 7-point racial class build, Halfling Burglars are limited to the 10th level of experience. They require (500 + 500 + 400 - 225) 1,175 XP to advance to level 2.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: The Halfling Bounder is built with class category values of HD 2, Fighting 2, Halfling 4. The HD 2 value would normally yield 1d8 hp per level, but the Weak class power reduces this to 1d6 hp per level. The Fighting 2 Unrestricted weapon selection is traded down to Broad weapon selection in exchange for 1 class power. Therefore the Halfling Bounder receives 1 class power and 4 halfling skills, for a total of 5 special abilities. As an 8-point racial build, Halfling Bounders are limited to the 8th level of experience. They require (1000 + 1000 + 150 - 150) 2,000 XP to advance to level 2.</p>\n",
