In <em><strong>ACKS</strong></em><em>,</em> it involves a concept we call “<strong>the agency theory of fun</strong>.”</p>\n<p>In philosophy, agency is the capacity for human beings to make choices and to impose those choices on the world. Agency is an important psychological need. Yet in our everyday lives, humans in modern society feel an absence of agency. Most of our capacity for meaningful choice is illusory; our daily lives are routine, and our scope of choice limited by lack of opportunity or resources. Very few people can really “change the world” in even a small way. Almost all of us lock on to meaningless decisions, such as what football team to support, or what color to dye our hair, as a means of expressing our need for agency. When those decisions don’t bring us any sense of agency, we grow ever more frustrated.</p>\n<p>At Autarch, we believe the great enjoyment elicited by tabletop RPGs is a result of creating a sense of agency among their players. In an RPG, by making choice X, the player can impose result Y, which is the essence of agency. And because tabletop RPGs are an experience shared within a meaningful social circle of friends and colleagues, result Y feels meaningful. In a sense, in the context of your circle of friends, Nick really did save Erik&#39;s life last week.</p>\n<p>Moreover, because tabletop RPGs are enjoyed sequentially, in a campaign format, the number of choices made and the impact of those choices compounds over time. The game becomes more meaningful the longer it is experienced. This is why long-term campaigns are more fun than one-off sessions, and why playing with a bunch of close friends is more fun than playing solitaire or with a group of strangers. Sustained campaigns with close friends create a stronger sense of agency.</p>\n<p>However, in order for a campaign to effectively create a sense of agency, the players must be able to make real (not faux) choices that have meaningful consequences on the players and their world. And that&#39;s a requirement which is in direct opposition to storytelling, or making sure everyone has fun.</p>\n<h3><strong>The Paradox of Gamemastering</strong></h3>\n<p>Imagine that your party has only a few minutes to find the artifact that can close the gate to the abyss. The artifact could be underneath the dark citadel, or on the peak of the lonely mountain — but they don&#39;t have time to search both. Now, if your players have real choice, the artifact is really in one location or the other, and their choice will determine whether or not they find it. On the other hand, if they have faux choice, then they only think they have choice. Whichever choice they make, that will be where the artifact is, along with an interesting, pre-scripted encounter of their level forcing them to fight to get it. So in the latter instance either choice is ‘fun” — but both are faux.</p>\n<p>Many GMs never offer real choice, because the problem with real choice is that players can only be sure they have real choice when they suffer meaningfully bad consequences. And in the context of a tabletop RPG, that usually means permanent destruction of something unique - a favored henchmen, irreplaceable magic artifact, animal companion, or player character.</p>\n<p>For a while, a skilled sleight-of-hand artist can maintain suspension of disbelief about the reality of choice, leading players on a roller coaster ride that makes them think they are making real choices and facing meaningful consequences. It&#39;s the same art that a skilled novelist can use to make us believe that a favorite character is in danger, even though he&#39;s not. But a never-ending string of perfect, dramatically appropriate, fun outcomes that defies probability eventually leads even the dimmest players to realize they don&#39;t have real choice at all. A roller coaster may be a wild ride, but it&#39;s still a railroad. And when the railroading gets revealed, the sense of agency dies, and with it dies the unique value of the tabletop RPG.</p>\n<p>So this, then, is the paradox of gamemastering: In order to make sure that everybody could have fun, you have to be willing to let the players make choices that lead to results that aren&#39;t fun. You can&#39;t guarantee the fun. And if you try to make sure everyone has fun, eventually you&#39;ll guarantee that no one has fun at all, because you&#39;ll destroy the sense of agency which is the root of the hobby&#39;s pleasure.</p>\n<h3>Why Rules Matter</h3>\n<p><em><strong>ACKS</strong></em>is first and foremost designed as a game that creates, empowers, and leverages player agency in the world. In fact, the agency theory of fun is precisely why <em><strong>ACKS</strong></em>offers rules for every aspect of the game world.</p>\n<p>Rules, in a tabletop RPG, are ultimately about what philosophers call action, where &quot;action&quot; means intentional effects caused by an agent. It is the rules that dictate the results of action, and thus define the relationship between a player&#39;s choices and the consequence he experiences. The rules provide the framework of cause and effect that gives meaning to choice. For instance, virtually every RPG has rules that dictate when you may choose to attack a target, how the success or failure of this attack is determined, and the consequences of each.</p>\n<p>A game without rules cannot provide a sense of agency, any more than a world without causality can. If the players operate subject to arbitrary outcomes — what the ancients called “Acts of God” and RPG designers call “GM Fiat” — they have no meaningful way of knowing or understanding what the consequences of their choices will be, and thus no agency.</p>\n<p>We believe that the agency theory of fun is the reason that esoteric games like <em><strong>Amber Diceless Roleplaying</strong></em> or <em><strong>Everway</strong></em> have never caught on, and why as games evolve, they tend to evolve in the direction of more rules. Comprehensible, detailed rules add to the players’ sense of agency, just as playing with friends in an ongoing campaign does.</p>\n<p>Agency also explains why dice are, and will always be, a popular mechanic with RPGs. As we explained above with the example of the hidden artifact, if the consequences are pre-determined, then the choice is not real. The inherent contradiction between omniscience and free will has plagued religion for thousands of years, and it plagues RPGs, too. For instance, imagine if tabletop RPG combat went like this:</p>\n<p>Player: “I attack the dragon.”</p>\n<p>Judge: “Based on your attack bonus and the dragon’s armor class, if you attack, you are certain to miss.”</p>\n<p>Player: “Uh... well I don&#39;t attack, then.”</p>\n<p>It&#39;s hard to imagine that game being much fun because the result of the player&#39;s choices is determined before he&#39;s made them. (This is the same reason that Tic-Tac-Toe isn&#39;t fun.) Agency, then, requires that we be able to predict the consequences of our choices, but not with certainty.</p>\n<p><em><strong>ACKS</strong></em> creates agency with its core mechanic, the throw: “A throw occurs whenever a character or monster is taking an action that will succeed or fail. To make a throw of the dice, you follow these steps: Throw the appropriate die for the action chosen; add any relevant modifiers to the number generated by the die; compare the total to a target value for the action, usually expressed as #+ (such as 12+).” The relevant modifiers and the target number provide causality. The die roll provides uncertainty. Both are essential.</p>\n",
