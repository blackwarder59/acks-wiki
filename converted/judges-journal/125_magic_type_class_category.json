As explained in the prior chapter*,* creating a custom class is a process of allocating <strong>build points</strong> to various <strong>class categories</strong> that define the strengths and weaknesses of the class. The Divine and Arcane magic types each have their own class category, and any new magic type must have its own class category value as well. When building a custom class, each class category is allocated between 0 and 4 build points. When more build points are allocated to the class category, more abilities from within that class category are available, and more XP are required to advance in level.</p>\n<p>At each build point (1-4), the magic type’s spell progression and Base XP Cost is modified upward or downward. As such, different class categories can be more or less powerful and expensive depending on the underlying magic type’s Base XP Cost. For example, assigning 2 build points to the Divine value allows a character class to cast spells at the full power of the character’s actual level, at a cost of 500 XP. Assigning 2 build points to the Arcane value allows a character class to cast spells at about half the characters’ actual level, at a cost of 1,250 XP.
