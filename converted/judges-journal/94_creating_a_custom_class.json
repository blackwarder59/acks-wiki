  "rawMarkdown": "## Creating a Custom Class\n\nThe core, campaign, and racial classes available in *ACKS Imperial Imprint* can create characters that fill the most common and popular archetypes of myth, legend, film, and literature. The variety of options for proficiencies, spells, spell signatures, alignment, and such can allow for fine-tuning characters, such that a fighter can be easily be a pirate or a mage can easily be a necromancer. Nevertheless, sometimes a campaign setting or a player’s character concept will demand a set of game mechanics that no combination of existing class powers and proficiencies can offer. In this case, you can use the custom class rules to create unique classes for your campaign and players.\n\nTo create a custom class of the human race, follow these ten steps:\n\n1. Start by allocating a total of 4 **build points** across each of 5 class categories: Hit Die, Fighting, Thievery, Divine, and Arcane. See the **Build Points and Class Categories** section, below.\n2. Determine the class Hit Dice per level based on its Hit Die Value. See the **Hit Die Value** section.\n3. Select weapons, armor, and fighting style proficiencies appropriate to the chosen Fighting Value. If desired, trade in selections of weapons, armor, or fighting style proficiencies in exchange for a choice of one or more custom powers. If the class has Fighting Value 2 or higher, note down the experience point cost for the custom powers. See the **Fighting Value** section.\n4. Select thief skills appropriate to the chosen Thievery Value. If desired, trade in thief skills for custom powers. See the **Thievery Value** section.\n5. Note down any spellcasting abilities appropriate to the chosen Divine or Arcane Values. If desired, trade in the ability to rebuke undead for one or more custom powers. See the **Divine Value** and **Arcane Value** sections, respectively.\n6. Determine the custom class’s saving throw progression based on its build point allocation. Use this information to determine magic items useable by the class, proficiencies, hit points after 9th level, and prime requisites. See the **Saving Throw Progress** section.\n7. Determine what type of stronghold and followers the custom class will receive at 9th level based on its build point allocation. Select a 5th level bonus power if appropriate. See the **Stronghold and Followers** section.\n8. Final the selection of the class’s custom powers. If desired, trade in a selection of skills or powers at 1st level for a larger selection of multiple powers unlocked at a higher level. See the **Custom Powers** section.\n9. Calculate the experience points required to advance to 2nd level and each level thereafter. Write these values down, assigning a title to each level appropriate to the theme of the custom class. See the **Experience Points per Level** section.\n10. Name the character class. Detail its role in the game world and explain why members of the class become adventurers.\n\nNote that Demi-Human Classes, discussed later under **Custom Demi-Human Classes**, are built using the same steps, but have more build points and categories.\n"
