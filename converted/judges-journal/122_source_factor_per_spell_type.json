There are 12 different <strong>spell types</strong>: Blast, Death, Detection, Enchantment, Esoteric, Healing, Illusion, Movement, Protection, Summoning, Transmogrification, and Wall. Esoteric spells are always created by you outside the strict categories of the game rules, so they are excluded from these mechanics. For each of the remaining 11 types, each magic type will have a different <strong>source factor</strong>. The lower the source factor, the easier it is for the spellcaster to cast spells of that type. For example, arcane magic excels in Blast type spells (source factor 1) while divine magic is very poor at this type (source factor 2.25). Conversely, divine magic excels at Healing spells (source factor 1) while arcane magic is sub-par at this type (source factor 2).</p>\n<p>The first step in creating a new magic type is to choose a source factor for each of the 11 spell types. Each spell type must have a source factor of at least 1 and no more than 2.25. Write down your magic type’s source factors in the appropriate rows of the Type Modifier column of the Source Factor Construction table, below.</p>\n<p>Now total all of the source factors and enter the sum in the Total row of the Type Modifier column. This is the type’s <strong>source factor total</strong>. The source factor total must be at least 11 and no more than 15. If source factor total is not within this range, increase or decrease your source factors until the sum of their values is between 11 and 15.</p>\n<p>The lower the source factor total, the more powerful the magic type and the more XP it will cost to advance in classes which use that type of magic. For reference, the arcane magic type has a source factor total of 12.5, while the divine magic type has a source factor total of 15.</p>\n<p>Next, find the difference between the Base Modifier listed on the table and the Type Modifier you wrote down in each row. Enter this value in the Variance column. Then multiply each Variance by the appropriate Cost of Variance to determine the Type Cost of that spell type. Total all of the Type Costs and enter the sum in the Total row of the Type Cost column.</p>\n<p>Finally, add the value you wrote down in the Type Cost column to 500. The resulting sum is the <strong>Base XP Cost</strong> of the new magic type you’ve created. Round this value to the closest value divisible by 25. Base XP Cost can never be lower than 500 XP; if less, increase or decrease your source factors until Base XP Cost is at least 500.</p>\n<p><strong>Source Factor Construction</strong></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Spell</strong>  <strong>Type</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Base</strong>  <strong>Modifier</strong></td>\n<td><strong>-</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Type</strong>  <strong>Modifier</strong></td>\n<td><strong>=</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Variance</strong></td>\n<td><strong>x</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Cost of</strong>  <strong>Variance</strong></td>\n<td><strong>=</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Type</strong>  <strong>Cost</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Magic Type’s</strong>  <strong>Base XP Cost</strong></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Blast</td>\n<td>2.25</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>=</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>x</td>\n<td>1,300</td>\n<td>=</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Death</td>\n<td>1.5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>=</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>x</td>\n<td>500</td>\n<td>=</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Detection</td>\n<td>1.25</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>=</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>x</td>\n<td>500</td>\n<td>=</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Enchantment</td>\n<td>1.3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>=</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>x</td>\n<td>500</td>\n<td>=</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Healing</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>=</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>x</td>\n<td>1,000</td>\n<td>=</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Illusion</td>\n<td>1.5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>=</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>x</td>\n<td>500</td>\n<td>=</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Movement</td>\n<td>1.25</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>=</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>x</td>\n<td>500</td>\n<td>=</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Protection</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>=</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>x</td>\n<td>500</td>\n<td>=</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Summoning</td>\n<td>1.2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>=</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>x</td>\n<td>500</td>\n<td>=</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Transmogrification</td>\n<td>1.25</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>=</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>x</td>\n<td>500</td>\n<td>=</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Wall</td>\n<td>1.5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>=</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>x</td>\n<td>500</td>\n<td>=</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Total</strong></td>\n<td>15.0</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td>n/a</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>n/a</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td>+ 500 =</td>\n<td>Base Cost</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>EXAMPLE: Below are three completed Source Factor Construction tables.

It has a Base XP Cost of 1,500 XP, lower than the Arcane type’s Base XP Cost of 2,500 but higher than the Divine type’s Base XP Cost of 500 XP.</p>\n<p><strong>A Note on Source Factors:</strong> The custom magic type construction rules require that each spell type be assigned a specific source factor. This is not always a simple matter, however. The source factor for Detection spells is subject to a host of modifiers that can make the source factor as high as x3 for some spells (e.g. arcane detection of curse). The source factor for Enchantment spells is even more ambiguous, as there are several source factors listed, depending on the type of effect, from x1 to x1.5 for Arcane and from x1 to x1.5 for Divine, again with source modifier factor stacked on top.</p>\n<p>To calculate the source factor for Detection spells, we assumed that each effect is approximately equal, and then calculated an average source factor for all of the effects. There are 13 different effects listed. Divine magic has a source factor of x1 on nine of these; x1.5 on two of these; and x2 on the last two. The average source factor is [(1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 +1 + 1 + 1.5 + 1.5 + 2 + 2) / 13] = 1.23. We rounded this to 1.25.</p>\n<p>For your own magic types, you can create similarly complex source factors and source factor modifiers if desired, at the cost of some math scribbling. If you want a custom magic type to have precisely the same factors as Arcane or Divine magic, just use the ones listed above – we’ve done the math for you. The fact that Faery type magic has a Detection source factor of 1.25 (same as Divine) could be understood to mean it builds Detection spells using the source modifier factors for Divine magic. But you could also disregard those complexities and simply build Faery spells with a source factor of x1.25, making it better than Divine magic at detecting treasure or secret doors, but worse at detecting evil or danger, for instance. This decision should be made when the magic type is created!</p>\n<h6>Specialized Magic types</h6>\n<p>The source factor rules above assume that all types of magic are capable of casting all 11 types of spells, albeit at greater or lesser effectiveness. Particular classes that use that type of magic, or particular characters of that class, might be specialized but the magic type itself is not.</p>\n<p>In some cases, you might wish to create a type of magic which is itself specialized. Perhaps he wants to create an evil type of sorcery that can only be used for death and summoning spells, or an elemental magic that can only be used for blast and wall spells. Because of this specialization, the magic type might be better at certain spells than is otherwise possible in the rules. For this reason, specialized magic types must be used carefully.</p>\n<p>To create a specialized magic type, simply remove one or more of the 11 spell types. Cross them out on the Source Factor Construction table – do not write down a type modifier for them and do not calculate a variance. For each spell type removed from the Source Factor Construction table, the magic type’s minimum source factor totals are reduced by 1.125, and its Base XP Cost is reduced by 45. (Base XP Cost must still be at least 500, however).</p>\n<p>Source factor modifiers for specialized magic types must always be equal to or lower than the base modifier for that type, to a minimum of 1. (You cannot have a specialized school of magic that is bad in casting its specialty!) Some specialized schools of magics might have some source factors below 1. If two spell types unavailable to the magic type, the minimum source factor for one spell type is reduced from 1 to 0.75. If four spell types are unavailable, the minimum source factor for two spell types is reduced from 1 to 0.75. Finally, if six or more spell types are unavailable, the minimum source factor for three spell types is reduced from 1 to 0.75.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: The Judge decides to create a magic type called Battlelore. Battlelore can only use Blast, Death, Protection, and Wall spells. This eliminates Detection, Enchantment, Illusion, Movement, Summoning, and Transmogrification, or 7 spell types. Battlelore’s minimum source factor total is [11 – (7 x 1.125)] 3.125. Its Base XP Cost is reduced by (7 x 45) 315 points. Since six or more spell types are unavailable to the magic type, up to three spell types can have source factors as low as 0.75. Battlelore’s source factors are set at Blast 0.75, Death 1, Protection 0.75, and Wall 0.75, for a source factor total of 3.25. Its Base XP Cost works out to 2,310, which rounds to 2,300. Battlelore has far less flexibility than Arcane magic, but a 6th blast, protection, or wall spell using Battlelore could be as powerful as an 8th level spell using Arcane magic!</p>\n<p><strong>Battlelore Type</strong></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Spell</strong>  <strong>Type</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Base</strong>  <strong>Modifier</strong></td>\n<td><strong>-</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Type</strong>  <strong>Modifier</strong></td>\n<td><strong>=</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Variance</strong></td>\n<td><strong>x</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Cost of</strong>  <strong>Variance</strong></td>\n<td><strong>=</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Type</strong>  <strong>Cost</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Magic Type’s</strong>  <strong>Base XP Cost</strong></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Blast</td>\n<td>2.25</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>0.75</td>\n<td>=</td>\n<td>1.25</td>\n<td>x</td>\n<td>1,300</td>\n<td>=</td>\n<td>1,625</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Death</td>\n<td><del>1.5</del></td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>1.0</td>\n<td>=</td>\n<td>0.5</td>\n<td>x</td>\n<td><del>500</del></td>\n<td>=</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><del>Detection</del></td>\n<td><del>1.25</del></td>\n<td><del>-</del></td>\n<td></td>\n<td><del>=</del></td>\n<td></td>\n<td><del>x</del></td>\n<td><del>500</del></td>\n<td><del>=</del></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><del>Enchantment</del></td>\n<td><del>1.3</del></td>\n<td><del>-</del></td>\n<td></td>\n<td><del>=</del></td>\n<td></td>\n<td><del>x</del></td>\n<td><del>500</del></td>\n<td><del>=</del></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><del>Healing</del></td>\n<td><del>1</del></td>\n<td><del>-</del></td>\n<td></td>\n<td><del>=</del></td>\n<td></td>\n<td><del>x</del></td>\n<td><del>1,000</del></td>\n<td><del>=</del></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><del>Illusion</del></td>\n<td><del>1.5</del></td>\n<td><del>-</del></td>\n<td></td>\n<td><del>=</del></td>\n<td></td>\n<td><del>x</del></td>\n<td><del>500</del></td>\n<td><del>=</del></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><del>Movement</del></td>\n<td><del>1.25</del></td>\n<td><del>-</del></td>\n<td></td>\n<td><del>=</del></td>\n<td></td>\n<td><del>x</del></td>\n<td><del>500</del></td>\n<td><del>=</del></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Protection</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>0.75</td>\n<td>=</td>\n<td>0.25</td>\n<td>x</td>\n<td>500</td>\n<td>=</td>\n<td>125</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><del>Summoning</del></td>\n<td><del>1.2</del></td>\n<td><del>-</del></td>\n<td></td>\n<td><del>=</del></td>\n<td></td>\n<td><del>x</del></td>\n<td><del>500</del></td>\n<td><del>=</del></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><del>Transmogrification</del></td>\n<td><del>1.25</del></td>\n<td><del>-</del></td>\n<td></td>\n<td><del>=</del></td>\n<td></td>\n<td><del>x</del></td>\n<td><del>500</del></td>\n<td><del>=</del></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Wall</td>\n<td>1.5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>0.75</td>\n<td>=</td>\n<td>0.75</td>\n<td>x</td>\n<td>500</td>\n<td>=</td>\n<td>375</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Total</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td>3.25</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>n/a</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>n/a</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>2,125</td>\n<td>+ <del>500</del> 185 =</td>\n<td>2,310</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n",

Each spell type must have a source factor of at least 1 and no more than 2.25. Write down your magic type’s source factors in the appropriate rows of the Type Modifier column of the Source Factor Construction table, below.</p>\n<p>Now total all of the source factors and enter the sum in the Total row of the Type Modifier column. This is the type’s <strong>source factor total</strong>. The source factor total must be at least 11 and no more than 15. If source factor total is not within this range, increase or decrease your source factors until the sum of their values is between 11 and 15.</p>\n<p>The lower the source factor total, the more powerful the magic type and the more XP it will cost to advance in classes which use that type of magic. For reference, the arcane magic type has a source factor total of 12.5, while the divine magic type has a source factor total of 15.</p>\n<p>Next, find the difference between the Base Modifier listed on the table and the Type Modifier you wrote down in each row. Enter this value in the Variance column. Then multiply each Variance by the appropriate Cost of Variance to determine the Type Cost of that spell type. Total all of the Type Costs and enter the sum in the Total row of the Type Cost column.</p>\n<p>Finally, add the value you wrote down in the Type Cost column to 500. The resulting sum is the <strong>Base XP Cost</strong> of the new magic type you’ve created. Round this value to the closest value divisible by 25. Base XP Cost can never be lower than 500 XP; if less, increase or decrease your source factors until Base XP Cost is at least 500.</p>\n<p><strong>Source Factor Construction</strong></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Spell</strong>  <strong>Type</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Base</strong>  <strong>Modifier</strong></td>\n<td><strong>-</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Type</strong>  <strong>Modifier</strong></td>\n<td><strong>=</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Variance</strong></td>\n<td><strong>x</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Cost of</strong>  <strong>Variance</strong></td>\n<td><strong>=</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Type</strong>  <strong>Cost</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Magic Type’s</strong>  <strong>Base XP Cost</strong></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Blast</td>\n<td>2.25</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>=</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>x</td>\n<td>1,300</td>\n<td>=</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Death</td>\n<td>1.5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>=</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>x</td>\n<td>500</td>\n<td>=</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Detection</td>\n<td>1.25</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>=</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>x</td>\n<td>500</td>\n<td>=</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Enchantment</td>\n<td>1.3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>=</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>x</td>\n<td>500</td>\n<td>=</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Healing</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>=</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>x</td>\n<td>1,000</td>\n<td>=</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Illusion</td>\n<td>1.5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>=</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>x</td>\n<td>500</td>\n<td>=</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Movement</td>\n<td>1.25</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>=</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>x</td>\n<td>500</td>\n<td>=</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Protection</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>=</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>x</td>\n<td>500</td>\n<td>=</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Summoning</td>\n<td>1.2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>=</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>x</td>\n<td>500</td>\n<td>=</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Transmogrification</td>\n<td>1.25</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>=</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>x</td>\n<td>500</td>\n<td>=</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Wall</td>\n<td>1.5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>=</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>x</td>\n<td>500</td>\n<td>=</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Total</strong></td>\n<td>15.0</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td>n/a</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>n/a</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td>+ 500 =</td>\n<td>Base Cost</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>EXAMPLE: Below are three completed Source Factor Construction tables.

It has a Base XP Cost of 1,500 XP, lower than the Arcane type’s Base XP Cost of 2,500 but higher than the Divine type’s Base XP Cost of 500 XP.</p>\n<p><strong>A Note on Source Factors:</strong> The custom magic type construction rules require that each spell type be assigned a specific source factor. This is not always a simple matter, however. The source factor for Detection spells is subject to a host of modifiers that can make the source factor as high as x3 for some spells (e.g. arcane detection of curse). The source factor for Enchantment spells is even more ambiguous, as there are several source factors listed, depending on the type of effect, from x1 to x1.5 for Arcane and from x1 to x1.5 for Divine, again with source modifier factor stacked on top.</p>\n<p>To calculate the source factor for Detection spells, we assumed that each effect is approximately equal, and then calculated an average source factor for all of the effects. There are 13 different effects listed. Divine magic has a source factor of x1 on nine of these; x1.5 on two of these; and x2 on the last two. The average source factor is [(1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 +1 + 1 + 1.5 + 1.5 + 2 + 2) / 13] = 1.23. We rounded this to 1.25.</p>\n<p>For your own magic types, you can create similarly complex source factors and source factor modifiers if desired, at the cost of some math scribbling. If you want a custom magic type to have precisely the same factors as Arcane or Divine magic, just use the ones listed above – we’ve done the math for you. The fact that Faery type magic has a Detection source factor of 1.25 (same as Divine) could be understood to mean it builds Detection spells using the source modifier factors for Divine magic. But you could also disregard those complexities and simply build Faery spells with a source factor of x1.25, making it better than Divine magic at detecting treasure or secret doors, but worse at detecting evil or danger, for instance. This decision should be made when the magic type is created!</p>\n"

Perhaps he wants to create an evil type of sorcery that can only be used for death and summoning spells, or an elemental magic that can only be used for blast and wall spells. Because of this specialization, the magic type might be better at certain spells than is otherwise possible in the rules. For this reason, specialized magic types must be used carefully.</p>\n<p>To create a specialized magic type, simply remove one or more of the 11 spell types. Cross them out on the Source Factor Construction table – do not write down a type modifier for them and do not calculate a variance.

If four spell types are unavailable, the minimum source factor for two spell types is reduced from 1 to 0.75. Finally, if six or more spell types are unavailable, the minimum source factor for three spell types is reduced from 1 to 0.75.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: The Judge decides to create a magic type called Battlelore. Battlelore can only use Blast, Death, Protection, and Wall spells. This eliminates Detection, Enchantment, Illusion, Movement, Summoning, and Transmogrification, or 7 spell types. Battlelore’s minimum source factor total is [11 – (7 x 1.125)] 3.125. Its Base XP Cost is reduced by (7 x 45) 315 points. Since six or more spell types are unavailable to the magic type, up to three spell types can have source factors as low as 0.75. Battlelore’s source factors are set at Blast 0.75, Death 1, Protection 0.75, and Wall 0.75, for a source factor total of 3.25. Its Base XP Cost works out to 2,310, which rounds to 2,300.

  "rawMarkdown": "## Source Factor per Spell Type\n\nAs explained in the ***ACKS II Revised Rulebook****,* all spells are categorized into **spell types**, which are broad descriptions of what spells are supposed to do. There are 12 different **spell types**: Blast, Death, Detection, Enchantment, Esoteric, Healing, Illusion, Movement, Protection, Summoning, Transmogrification, and Wall. Esoteric spells are always created by you outside the strict categories of the game rules, so they are excluded from these mechanics. For each of the remaining 11 types, each magic type will have a different **source factor**. The lower the source factor, the easier it is for the spellcaster to cast spells of that type. For example, arcane magic excels in Blast type spells (source factor 1) while divine magic is very poor at this type (source factor 2.25). Conversely, divine magic excels at Healing spells (source factor 1) while arcane magic is sub-par at this type (source factor 2).\n\nThe first step in creating a new magic type is to choose a source factor for each of the 11 spell types. Each spell type must have a source factor of at least 1 and no more than 2.25. Write down your magic type’s source factors in the appropriate rows of the Type Modifier column of the Source Factor Construction table, below.\n\nNow total all of the source factors and enter the sum in the Total row of the Type Modifier column. This is the type’s **source factor total**. The source factor total must be at least 11 and no more than 15. If source factor total is not within this range, increase or decrease your source factors until the sum of their values is between 11 and 15.\n\nThe lower the source factor total, the more powerful the magic type and the more XP it will cost to advance in classes which use that type of magic. For reference, the arcane magic type has a source factor total of 12.5, while the divine magic type has a source factor total of 15.\n\nNext, find the difference between the Base Modifier listed on the table and the Type Modifier you wrote down in each row. Enter this value in the Variance column. Then multiply each Variance by the appropriate Cost of Variance to determine the Type Cost of that spell type. Total all of the Type Costs and enter the sum in the Total row of the Type Cost column.\n\nFinally, add the value you wrote down in the Type Cost column to 500. The resulting sum is the **Base XP Cost** of the new magic type you’ve created. Round this value to the closest value divisible by 25. Base XP Cost can never be lower than 500 XP; if less, increase or decrease your source factors until Base XP Cost is at least 500.\n\n**Source Factor Construction**\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Spell**  **Type** | **Base**  **Modifier** | **-** | **Type**  **Modifier** | **=** | **Variance** | **x** | **Cost of**  **Variance** | **=** | **Type**  **Cost** | **Magic Type’s**  **Base XP Cost** | |\n| Blast | 2.25 | - |  | = |  | x | 1,300 | = |  |  |  |\n| Death | 1.5 | - |  | = |  | x | 500 | = |  |  |  |\n| Detection | 1.25 | - |  | = |  | x | 500 | = |  |  |  |\n| Enchantment | 1.3 | - |  | = |  | x | 500 | = |  |  |  |\n| Healing | 1 | - |  | = |  | x | 1,000 | = |  |  |  |\n| Illusion | 1.5 | - |  | = |  | x | 500 | = |  |  |  |\n| Movement | 1.25 | - |  | = |  | x | 500 | = |  |  |  |\n| Protection | 1 | - |  | = |  | x | 500 | = |  |  |  |\n| Summoning | 1.2 | - |  | = |  | x | 500 | = |  |  |  |\n| Transmogrification | 1.25 | - |  | = |  | x | 500 | = |  |  |  |\n| Wall | 1.5 | - |  | = |  | x | 500 | = |  |  |  |\n| **Total** | 15.0 |  |  |  | n/a |  | n/a |  |  | + 500 = | Base Cost |\n\nEXAMPLE: Below are three completed Source Factor Construction tables. The first table is for the Divine magic type (used by crusaders), the second table is for the Arcane magic type (used by mages) and the third table is for a new magic type called Faery. The Faery magic type excels at enchantments, illusion, transformation, and similar glamours, but is poor at blast and death spells.\n\n**Divine Magic Type**\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Spell**  **Type** | **Base**  **Modifier** | **-** | **Type**  **Modifier** | **=** | **Variance** | **x** | **Cost of**  **Variance** | **=** | **Type**  **Cost** | **Magic Type’s**  **Base XP Cost** | |\n| Blast | 2.25 | - | 2.25 | = | 0 | x | 1,300 | = | 0 |  |  |\n| Death | 1.5 | - | 1.5 | = | 0 | x | 500 | = | 0 |  |  |\n| Detection | 1.25 | - | 1.25 | = | 0 | x | 500 | = | 0 |  |  |\n| Enchantment | 1.3 | - | 1.3 | = | 0 | x | 500 | = | 0 |  |  |\n| Healing | 1 | - | 1 | = | 0 | x | 1,000 | = | 0 |  |  |\n| Illusion | 1.5 | - | 1.5 | = | 0 | x | 500 | = | 0 |  |  |\n| Movement | 1.25 | - | 1.25 | = | 0 | x | 500 | = | 0 |  |  |\n| Protection | 1 | - | 1 | = | 0 | x | 500 | = | 0 |  |  |\n| Summoning | 1.2 | - | 1.2 | = | 0 | x | 500 | = | 0 |  |  |\n| Transmogrification | 1.25 | - | 1.25 | = | 0 | x | 500 | = | 0 |  |  |\n| Wall | 1.5 | - | 1.5 | = | 0 | x | 500 | = | 0 |  |  |\n| Total | 15.0 |  | 15.0 |  | n/a |  | n/a |  | 0 | + 500 = | 500 |\n\n**Arcane Magic Type**\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Spell**  **Type** | **Base**  **Modifier** | **-** | **Type**  **Modifier** | **=** | **Variance** | **x** | **Cost of**  **Variance** | **=** | **Type**  **Cost** | **Magic Type’s**  **Base XP Cost** | |\n| Blast | 2.25 | - | 1 | = | 1.25 | x | 1,300 | = | 1625 |  |  |\n| Death | 1.5 | - | 1 | = | 0.5 | x | 500 | = | 250 |  |  |\n| Detection | 1.25 | - | 1 | = | 0.25 | x | 500 | = | 125 |  |  |\n| Enchantment | 1.3 | - | 1 | = | 0.3 | x | 500 | = | 150 |  |  |\n| Healing | 1 | - | 2 | = | -1 | x | 1,000 | = | -1000 |  |  |\n| Illusion | 1.5 | - | 1 | = | 0.5 | x | 500 | = | 250 |  |  |\n| Movement | 1.25 | - | 1 | = | 0.25 | x | 500 | = | 125 |  |  |\n| Protection | 1 | - | 1 | = | 0 | x | 500 | = | 0 |  |  |\n| Summoning | 1.2 | - | 1 | = | 0.2 | x | 500 | = | 100 |  |  |\n| Transmogrification | 1.25 | - | 1 | = | 0.25 | x | 500 | = | 125 |  |  |\n| Wall | 1.5 | - | 1 | = | 0.5 | x | 500 | = | 250 |  |  |\n| Total | 15.0 |  | 12.5 |  | n/a |  | n/a |  | 2,000 | + 500 = | 2,500 |\n\n**Faery Magic Type**\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Spell**  **Type** | **Base**  **Modifier** | **-** | **Type**  **Modifier** | **=** | **Variance** | **x** | **Cost of**  **Variance** | **=** | **Type**  **Cost** | **Magic Type’s**  **Base XP Cost** | |\n| Blast | 2.25 | - | 2.25 | = | 0 | x | 1,300 | = | 0 |  |  |\n| Death | 1.5 | - | 1.5 | = | 0 | x | 500 | = | 0 |  |  |\n| Detection | 1.25 | - | 1.25 | = | 0 | x | 500 | = | 0 |  |  |\n| Enchantment | 1.3 | - | 1 | = | 0.3 | x | 500 | = | 150 |  |  |\n| Healing | 1 | - | 1 | = | 0 | x | 1,000 | = | 0 |  |  |\n| Illusion | 1.5 | - | 1 | = | 0.5 | x | 500 | = | 250 |  |  |\n| Movement | 1.25 | - | 1 | = | 0.25 | x | 500 | = | 125 |  |  |\n| Protection | 1 | - | 1 | = | 0 | x | 500 | = | 0 |  |  |\n| Summoning | 1.2 | - | 1 | = | 0.2 | x | 500 | = | 100 |  |  |\n| Transmogrification | 1.25 | - | 1 | = | 0.25 | x | 500 | = | 125 |  |  |\n| Wall | 1.5 | - | 1 | = | 0.5 | x | 500 | = | 250 |  |  |\n| Total | 15.0 |  | 12.75 |  | n/a |  | n/a |  | 1,000 | + 500 = | 1,500 |\n\nEXAMPLE (cont.): As can be seen, the Faery magic type is mid-way between the power and XP cost of the Arcane and Divine magic types. It has a Base XP Cost of 1,500 XP, lower than the Arcane type’s Base XP Cost of 2,500 but higher than the Divine type’s Base XP Cost of 500 XP.\n\n**A Note on Source Factors:** The custom magic type construction rules require that each spell type be assigned a specific source factor. This is not always a simple matter, however. The source factor for Detection spells is subject to a host of modifiers that can make the source factor as high as x3 for some spells (e.g. arcane detection of curse). The source factor for Enchantment spells is even more ambiguous, as there are several source factors listed, depending on the type of effect, from x1 to x1.5 for Arcane and from x1 to x1.5 for Divine, again with source modifier factor stacked on top.\n\nTo calculate the source factor for Detection spells, we assumed that each effect is approximately equal, and then calculated an average source factor for all of the effects. There are 13 different effects listed. Divine magic has a source factor of x1 on nine of these; x1.5 on two of these; and x2 on the last two. The average source factor is [(1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 +1 + 1 + 1.5 + 1.5 + 2 + 2) / 13] = 1.23. We rounded this to 1.25.\n\nFor your own magic types, you can create similarly complex source factors and source factor modifiers if desired, at the cost of some math scribbling. If you want a custom magic type to have precisely the same factors as Arcane or Divine magic, just use the ones listed above – we’ve done the math for you. The fact that Faery type magic has a Detection source factor of 1.25 (same as Divine) could be understood to mean it builds Detection spells using the source modifier factors for Divine magic. But you could also disregard those complexities and simply build Faery spells with a source factor of x1.25, making it better than Divine magic at detecting treasure or secret doors, but worse at detecting evil or danger, for instance. This decision should be made when the magic type is created!\n\n###### Specialized Magic types\n\nThe source factor rules above assume that all types of magic are capable of casting all 11 types of spells, albeit at greater or lesser effectiveness. Particular classes that use that type of magic, or particular characters of that class, might be specialized but the magic type itself is not.\n\nIn some cases, you might wish to create a type of magic which is itself specialized. Perhaps he wants to create an evil type of sorcery that can only be used for death and summoning spells, or an elemental magic that can only be used for blast and wall spells. Because of this specialization, the magic type might be better at certain spells than is otherwise possible in the rules. For this reason, specialized magic types must be used carefully.\n\nTo create a specialized magic type, simply remove one or more of the 11 spell types. Cross them out on the Source Factor Construction table – do not write down a type modifier for them and do not calculate a variance. For each spell type removed from the Source Factor Construction table, the magic type’s minimum source factor totals are reduced by 1.125, and its Base XP Cost is reduced by 45. (Base XP Cost must still be at least 500, however).\n\nSource factor modifiers for specialized magic types must always be equal to or lower than the base modifier for that type, to a minimum of 1. (You cannot have a specialized school of magic that is bad in casting its specialty!) Some specialized schools of magics might have some source factors below 1. If two spell types unavailable to the magic type, the minimum source factor for one spell type is reduced from 1 to 0.75. If four spell types are unavailable, the minimum source factor for two spell types is reduced from 1 to 0.75. Finally, if six or more spell types are unavailable, the minimum source factor for three spell types is reduced from 1 to 0.75.\n\nEXAMPLE: The Judge decides to create a magic type called Battlelore. Battlelore can only use Blast, Death, Protection, and Wall spells. This eliminates Detection, Enchantment, Illusion, Movement, Summoning, and Transmogrification, or 7 spell types. Battlelore’s minimum source factor total is [11 – (7 x 1.125)] 3.125. Its Base XP Cost is reduced by (7 x 45) 315 points. Since six or more spell types are unavailable to the magic type, up to three spell types can have source factors as low as 0.75. Battlelore’s source factors are set at Blast 0.75, Death 1, Protection 0.75, and Wall 0.75, for a source factor total of 3.25. Its Base XP Cost works out to 2,310, which rounds to 2,300. Battlelore has far less flexibility than Arcane magic, but a 6th blast, protection, or wall spell using Battlelore could be as powerful as an 8th level spell using Arcane magic!\n\n**Battlelore Type**\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Spell**  **Type** | **Base**  **Modifier** | **-** | **Type**  **Modifier** | **=** | **Variance** | **x** | **Cost of**  **Variance** | **=** | **Type**  **Cost** | **Magic Type’s**  **Base XP Cost** | |\n| Blast | 2.25 | - | 0.75 | = | 1.25 | x | 1,300 | = | 1,625 |  |  |\n| Death | ~~1.5~~ | - | 1.0 | = | 0.5 | x | ~~500~~ | = |  |  |  |\n| ~~Detection~~ | ~~1.25~~ | ~~-~~ |  | ~~=~~ |  | ~~x~~ | ~~500~~ | ~~=~~ |  |  |  |\n| ~~Enchantment~~ | ~~1.3~~ | ~~-~~ |  | ~~=~~ |  | ~~x~~ | ~~500~~ | ~~=~~ |  |  |  |\n| ~~Healing~~ | ~~1~~ | ~~-~~ |  | ~~=~~ |  | ~~x~~ | ~~1,000~~ | ~~=~~ |  |  |  |\n| ~~Illusion~~ | ~~1.5~~ | ~~-~~ |  | ~~=~~ |  | ~~x~~ | ~~500~~ | ~~=~~ |  |  |  |\n| ~~Movement~~ | ~~1.25~~ | ~~-~~ |  | ~~=~~ |  | ~~x~~ | ~~500~~ | ~~=~~ |  |  |  |\n| Protection | 1 | - | 0.75 | = | 0.25 | x | 500 | = | 125 |  |  |\n| ~~Summoning~~ | ~~1.2~~ | ~~-~~ |  | ~~=~~ |  | ~~x~~ | ~~500~~ | ~~=~~ |  |  |  |\n| ~~Transmogrification~~ | ~~1.25~~ | ~~-~~ |  | ~~=~~ |  | ~~x~~ | ~~500~~ | ~~=~~ |  |  |  |\n| Wall | 1.5 | - | 0.75 | = | 0.75 | x | 500 | = | 375 |  |  |\n| Total |  |  | 3.25 |  | n/a |  | n/a |  | 2,125 | + ~~500~~ 185 = | 2,310 |\n"
