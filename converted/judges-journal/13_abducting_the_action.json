To fill up this new world, we began liberally adapting unused encounters and dungeons from other products and places.

If we had simply changed the ettin into an alien, this portal would not have existed, and the game world would have been a less interesting place.</p>\n<p>Note that we did not start with the idea of the portal — we started with the arbitrary appearance of the creature.

It&#39;s finding an explanation for something that didn&#39;t have one — an explanation that makes the campaign (hopefully) better.</p>\n<h3><strong>Making Abduction Work For You</strong></h3>\n<p>The art of abduction depends on having a set of “surprising facts,” that is, a circumstance you need to explain. Fortunately, such facts are never in short supply. Indeed, the easiest and most accessible method of brainstorming available to any <em><strong>ACKS</strong></em>Judge is random generation of facts. This <em><strong>Judges Journal</strong></em>is filled with random tables in its later chapters. If those aren’t enough, you can find hundreds of game accessories online that can randomly generate content for you — random adventure generators, random magic swords, random taverns, random jewelry, random monsters, and on and on.</p>\n<p>For example, with a single click on a random adventure generator, we once randomly created a dungeon called “The Weird Citadel of Secrets” with many rooms. One of these was Room 45, which noted “there are cracks in the floor here” and “treasure: 500sp, 20gp.” The surprising fact here is “there is treasure in an otherwise empty room with cracks in the floor.” We abduced that “if the treasure belonged to adventurers who had fallen into the cracks in the floor, this would make sense.” And, presto! The cracks in the floor became large, menacing cracks which must have broken under the feet of some hapless hero, whose precious wealth lingers there still. This is the oracular power of the dice at work!</p>\n<p>Another great source of “surprising facts” is through adaptation — porting content from other sources into your campaign setting. For instance, in the Auran Empire, we’ve made use of old D&amp;D modules such as Isle of Dread, Against the Giants, and City of the Gods, each of which came from a different campaign setting (Mystara, Greyhawk, and Blackmoor respectively). You can do the same with articles from Dragon and Dungeon magazine or various internet sources; modules from other game systems; ideas stolen from your favorite TV shows, movies, and books; or anything else you can take inspiration from! The ettin from earlier is a great example of this.</p>\n<p>A third method of generating “surprising facts” is to rely on your players, who are endlessly dietrological. For instance, let’s imagine that your adventurers are on a wilderness expedition through a supposedly-dangerous forest. You haven’t prepped any particular content for this forest, and are relying on procedural generation to create encounters as they explore. Thus, as they move from hex to hex, you roll random encounter checks. But let’s say the checks keep failing — the party has no encounters! They begin to get suspicious. As the session draws to a close, one of the players says, “It’s altogether creepy that we haven’t encountered anythingin this forest. There must be some great evil here that brooks no rivals to its power.” The other group members nod, and the party leader says, “next session, we will find it and kill it.” Here the players have abduced the presence of a monster from the surprising lack of wandering monsters. Since you haven’t already fleshed this area out, you decide to run with this idea. For next session, you work up the lair of a powerful monster in a nearby hex.</p>\n<p>In this case, abduction is akin to the quantum mechanics of a role-playing game world. Explanations for the facts of the game world may not exist until they are consciously observed; until then they are merely potential explanations, ideas floating in the seas of possibility. Abduction is how you plunge into the ocean of ideas and find the best ones to explain the facts you&#39;re dealing with in your game.</p>\n<p>Abductive reasoning is so powerful and useful that a skilled Judge can use it to run entire adventures on the fly. All such masters need is a bunch of interesting and completely unconnected events and a bit of imagination. We encourage you to master the art of abduction — but we caution against letting it become your primary method of running your game. Used too often, it can create a solipsistic world where things become true only if and when the players think so. That is ultimately detrimental to the game, removing real choice from the players. For a Judge committed to the agency theory of fun, the best way of using abduction is to have it help explain what has happened, not change what will happen.</p>\n",
