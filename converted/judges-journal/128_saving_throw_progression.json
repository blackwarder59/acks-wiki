The saving throw progression is critical, because it also determines the character’s magical item options, prime requisite, proficiencies, and hit points after 9th level.</p>\n<p>Since these rules add the ability to create new class category values offering new magic types, it is entirely possible that character classes might have saving throw progressions that don’t exist yet. For instance, at what rate does a class with Faery 3, Fighting 1 advance in saving throws? How many hit points does it receive after 9th level? What magic items can it use? These rules explain how to create a unique saving throw progression for newly-created class categories.</p>\n<h6>Progression Rate</h6>\n<p>The class category of a new magic type will have a saving throw progression rate such as “2 points every 6 levels”. This rate is determined by its source factor total, its repertoire acquisition method, and its code of behavior.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Source Factor Total</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Inherited or Studious,</strong>  <strong>No Code of Behavior</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Inherited or Studious,</strong>  <strong>With Code of Behavior</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Any Prayerful</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12.5 or less</td>\n<td>2 points every 6 levels</td>\n<td>2 points every 6 levels</td>\n<td>2 points every 4 levels</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12.6 – 13.5</td>\n<td>2 points every 6 levels</td>\n<td>2 points every 4 levels</td>\n<td>2 points every 4 levels</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13.6 or more</td>\n<td>2 points every 4 levels</td>\n<td>2 points every 4 levels</td>\n<td>2 points every 4 levels</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>EXAMPLE: Faery magic is inherited, imposes a code of behavior, and has a source factor total of 12.75.

It has a Blast modifier of 2.25 and a Healing modifier of 1, which yields a quotient of 2.25. Therefore the class category can offer the ability to use either mage or crusader magic items. This choice is left open until specific custom classes are built for the magic type.\n\n###### Prime Requisite\n\nThe prime requisite(s) of classes with the new saving throw progression are determined by cross-referencing its repertoire acquisition method with the quotient of its Blast modifier / Healing modifier on the table below.
