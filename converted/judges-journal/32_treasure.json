A dragon’s or evil sorcerer-king’s hoard will lay glimmering in the torchlight, coin in uncountable volume like the sands of the desert. Sprinkled among the coin will be goods from exotic lands, trophies of monsters and victories won, and possibly even items of legendary power. Bold adventurers may carry off a few choice items and precious metals, but few parties could plunder the full hoard unless they’ve brought an army.</p>\n<p>Along with fame and derring-do, treasure is one of the primary motivations of adventuring parties. Treasure is not only used to retain hirelings and purchase equipment, weapons, vessels, and strongholds; each gold piece worth of treasure brought safely back to civilization gives the character 1 experience point (as described in <em><strong>ACKS II</strong></em><em><strong>RR</strong></em>Chapter 6, <strong>Earning Experience from Adventures</strong>). In most campaigns, experience from treasure recovered on adventures will be the main source of character level advancement. In fact, <em><strong>ACKS</strong></em>assumes that 80% of adventuring XP will come from treasure. Therefore, all of the rules herein are designed and intended to generate a total amount of treasure in any given lair or dungeon equal to four times the XP value of the monsters in the area.</p>\n<p><strong>Designer’s Note:</strong> Many <em><strong>ACKS</strong></em>Judges like to adapt adventures from other D20 fantasy games for use with <em><strong>ACKS</strong></em><em>.</em> (We do this ourselves for our own home campaigns.) However, when you adapt third-party adventures into <em><strong>ACKS</strong></em><em>,</em> be sure to calculate the value of the treasure in those adventures relative to the XP value of the monsters therein. Other D20 fantasy games usually provide much less treasure per monster than <em><strong>ACKS</strong></em>expects. That, in turn, has the unfortunate side-effect of resulting in a much slower advancement curve than <em><strong>ACKS</strong></em>expects. Don’t be alarmed if your players advance in level and wealth in <em><strong>ACKS</strong></em>faster than they do in <em>OSE</em> or <em>LOTFP.</em> They’re supposed to! Because of its deep campaign rules, <em><strong>ACKS</strong></em>has considerably more activities for high-level player characters to undertake with considerably more “money sinks” to drain their accumulated wealth than any other D20 fantasy game.</p>\n<h3>Random Treasure Generation</h3>\n<p>Treasure will usually be found in the lairs of monsters. Each monster entry in the <em><strong>ACKS Monstrous Manual</strong></em> designates whether or not that type of monster has the possibility of treasure. Those that do are given a Treasure Type (TT), which indicates what kinds and quantities of treasure a monster might have. On average, the amount of treasure assigned to a monster by its Treasure Type equals four times its XP.</p>\n<p>The Treasure Types are lettered from A to R, with TT A yielding the smallest hoards and TT R the largest. In addition to their quantitative rank, the Treasure Types are further sub-divided into three categories, representing the method by which the monsters have accumulated the treasure: by <strong>hoarding</strong>, by <strong>raiding</strong>, or <strong>incidentally</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hoarding monsters are typically intelligent enough to appreciate the value of wealth, and powerful enough to gain and defend substantial amounts of it. Hoarder Treasure Types (B, D, H, N, Q, R) feature a roughly equal mix of coins and other valuables, and typically yield values far in excess of their weight.</li>\n<li>Raiding monsters are intelligent creatures who gather treasure by stealing it from those weaker than themselves. Raiders are often the minions of more powerful monster who claim the most precious items for themselves, so Raider Treasure Types (E, G, J, L, O) are mostly bulky hoards of low value coin and goods.</li>\n<li>Monsters with incidental treasure accumulate wealth accidentally, e.g. by bringing dead adventurers back to the lair to feed their young. Though they may lack the intelligence to recognize things of value, they may be attracted to shiny objects which they gather as best they can with their claws or jaws. The Incidental Treasure Types (A, C, F, I, K, M, P) are usually only a few stone in weight and are the most variable type of treasure, with some rolls on these tables yielding fantastic bounty while as many others produce nothing at all.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Because of how the Treasure Types are structured, a dungeon with a variety of monsters will tend to have a wide assortment of interesting treasures, ranging from precious regalia to bulky low value coin.</p>\n<p>You can randomly generate a monster’s treasure using their Treasure Types by rolling on the Treasure Type tables. There are two different Treasure Type tables, the Classic table and the Heroic table. While the tables are equivalent in terms of the total value of treasure provided for each Treasure Type, they differ in two important ways.</p>\n<p>The first difference is in the composition of coin. On the Classic table, low-level hoards consisted mostly of common coin (cp and sp), while high-level hoards consisted mostly of precious coin (gp and pp). On the Heroic table, all hoards consist mostly of common coin, with high-level hoards consisting of a lotof common coin with moderate amounts of precious coin. Thus, treasure hoards generated using the Heroic table are considerably larger in total bulk than those generated on the Classic table.</p>\n<p>For instance, a dragon hoard (TT R) generated on the Treasure Type (Classic) table would typically contain 1750sp, 2100gp, and 3600pp. The same hoard generated on the Treasure Type (Heroic) table would typically contain 19600cp, 14000sp, 5600ep, 4000gp, and 2625pp. The first hoard is worth 20,275gp and weighs 7.5 stone. The second hoard is worth 21,525gp and weighs 46 stone – seven times as much!</p>\n<p>The second difference is in the composition of magic items. On the Classic table, magic items are generated by type (potion, scroll, sword, etc.) while on the Heroic table magic items are generated by rarity (common, rare, etc.). The Classic table tends to provide a great variance in the items that are found. Sometimes low-level monsters may have hoards with powerful magic items, and sometimes high-level monsters may have weak items. The Heroic table tends to provide a greater volume of items with more predictability in power.</p>\n<p>Which Treasure Table to use is up to you, the Judge. The Classic table, as the name implies, is intended to offer treasures similar to those found in classic old-school adventurers popular in the 1970s and 1980s. The Heroic table is intended to offer hoards similar to those found in heroic fantasy literature. You can pick one table and use it for your entire campaign.</p>\n<p>Unless otherwise noted, randomly generated treasures are found only in the monster’s lair. If the monster entry specifies that a creature carries individual treasure either instead of or in addition to its lair treasure, these individual treasures may be found even if the monster is encountered when wandering outside its lair.</p>\n<h3>Planned Treasure Generation</h3>\n<p>Since the amount of treasure allowed in the campaign directly controls the speed at which the adventurers level, as well as their overall power and capabilities, it is always up to you to determine how much treasure to place into the campaign. As the Judge, you are never “required” to roll for treasure. In fact, there will be many cases where random treasure generation is not the best method to employ. Whenever you deem it necessary or appropriate, you can and should place treasure by hand or amend random treasures you’ve rolled. Particularly important treasures should always be placed by you deliberately; for example, a magic item crafted by a major antagonist should be tailored to the antagonist’s personality and role in the campaign.</p>\n<p>When creating a dungeon or other adventure area, one easy way to generate treasure is to calculate the sum of all XP from monsters in the area, and then choose a Treasure Type whose average value is close to four times this sum. If the category of this treasure table (hoarder, raider, or incidental) does not seem appropriate to the area, you can instead choose one or more Treasure Types from the appropriate category that have the closest average value. You then can randomly generate treasure for the area using the selected table. Because probabilities are involved, the result may not match the desired value. If the outcome is too much treasure, you can add more monsters or remove some treasure. If too little treasure results, you can make up the difference with special treasures placed by hand. It is also fine to go with high or low results; over time, the law of averages will assert itself.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: An underground crypt has been stocked with 20 skeletons (13 XP each), 1 wight (80 XP), 4 giant bats (29 XP each) and 7 pit vipers (3840 XP each), for a total of 722 XP. The crypt treasure should be around four times that total (4 x 722), or 2,888gp. This is close to the 3,250gp average value of Treasure Type I. Treasure Type I is an incidental type treasure, which seems appropriate for the crypt’s burial goods. Using row I on the Treasure Type table, the Judge rolls 2,000 silver pieces and 5 pieces of jewelry, and places some of this treasure in the coffins guarded by the undead and the rest on the corpse of a bandit at the bottom of a pit trap.</p>\n<h3>Treasure Type Tables</h3>\n<p>To use the Treasure Type tables, find the row on your choice of table that corresponds to the monster’s TT. For each column on the row, roll the appropriate dice to determine whether the specified treasure is present, and if so, in what quantity. When the dice indicate that gems, jewelry, or magic items are present, the specific treasures found in these categories are then determined using sub-tables provided after the Treasure Types table. If you wish to create more diverse and interesting treasures, you can then combine the treasure generated into lots and use the Special Treasures table, as described below.</p>\n<h6>Treasure Type Table (Classic)</h6>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Treasure Type &amp; Avg.

exactly what’s in the hoard. Magic items are complex enough to merit their own section (p. XX). Gems, jewelry, and special treasures are detailed below.</p>\n<h6>Gems</h6>\n<p>When gems are found, you can choose or roll for their value in gold pieces on the <strong>Gem Value</strong> table. You can determine one value for all the games in a treasure hoard, divide the gems up into groups and determine different values for each group, or determine the value of each individual gem, as you prefer. The average value of gems is 200gp per gemstone.</p>\n<p>Gems appearing in a treasure hoard might be specified to be ornamentals or brilliants. Ornamentals have a value between 10 - 50gp (average 30gp), and can be randomly generated by rolling 2d20 on the chart below. Brilliants are between 500 - 10,000gp (average 4,000gp), and can be randomly generated by rolling 1d100 + 80. The Treasure Type table uses the most valuable gems to minimize the number of rolls on the gem sub-table for Judges who are randomizing each separately; if you want to create a hoard consisting of more lower value gems, you can convert each brilliant to 11 gems, and each gem to 7 ornamentals.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: The Judge’s results for TT Q indicate that 3 brilliants are present in a hoard. Seeing that their average value is 5,000gp each, the Judge could actually place this 15,000gp in gems as one 10,000gp flawless blue diamond, three 1,000gp rubies, four 250gp pearls, and ten 10gp quartz crystals, or any other combination desired.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Roll</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Gem Value (gp)</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Type</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>2d20</strong></td>\n<td><em>avg. 30</em></td>\n<td><em>Ornamental</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>d100</strong></td>\n<td><em>avg. 200</em></td>\n<td><em>Gem</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>d100+80</strong></td>\n<td><em>avg. 4,000</em></td>\n<td><em>Brilliant</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>01-10</td>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>Azurite, hematite, malachite, obsidian, quartz</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11-25</td>\n<td>25</td>\n<td>Agate, lapis lazuli, tiger eye, turquoise</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>26-40</td>\n<td>50</td>\n<td>Bloodstone, crystal, citrine, jasper, moonstone, onyx</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>41-55</td>\n<td>75</td>\n<td>Carnelian, chalcedony, sardonyx, zircon</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>56-70</td>\n<td>100</td>\n<td>Amber, amethyst, coral, jade, jet, tourmaline</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>71-80</td>\n<td>250</td>\n<td>Garnet, pearl, spinel</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>81-90</td>\n<td>500</td>\n<td>Aquamarine, alexandrite, topaz</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>91-95</td>\n<td>750</td>\n<td>Opal, star ruby, star sapphire, sunset amethyst, imperial topaz</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>96-100</td>\n<td>1,000</td>\n<td>Black sapphire, diamond, emerald, jacinth, ruby</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>101-110</td>\n<td>1,500</td>\n<td>Amber with preserved extinct creatures, whorled nephrite jade</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>111-125</td>\n<td>2,000</td>\n<td>Black pearl, baroque pearl, crystal geode</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>126-145</td>\n<td>4,000</td>\n<td>Facet cut imperial topaz, flawless diamond</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>146-165</td>\n<td>6,000</td>\n<td>Facet cut star sapphire or star ruby</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>166-175</td>\n<td>8,000</td>\n<td>Flawless facet cut diamond, emerald, jacinth or ruby</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>176-180</td>\n<td>10,000</td>\n<td>Flawless facet cut black sapphire or blue diamond</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h6>Jewelry</h6>\n<p>Jewelry can vary in value in a similar manner to gems. You can choose or roll for the value of jewelry in a treasure hoard on the <strong>Jewelry Value</strong> table. The average value of jewelry is 1,000gp per piece.</p>\n<p>Jewelry appearing in a treasure hoard might be specified to be trinkets or regalia. Trinkets have values of 2-800gp (average 225gp), and can be randomly generated by rolling 2d20 on the chart below. Regalia values range from 1,000-80,000gp (average 12,000gp) and can be randomly generated using 1d100 + 80. The treasure charts give jewelry treasures using the most valuable unit of jewelry for the convenience of randomizing each one separately; if you want to use average values to generate a larger quantity of jewelry, you can convert each piece of regalia to 12 pieces of jewelry, each of which may be in turn converted to 4 trinkets.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Roll</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Jewelry Value (gp)</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Type</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>2d20</strong></td>\n<td><em>avg. 225</em></td>\n<td><em>Trinkets</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>d100</strong></td>\n<td><em>avg. 1,000</em></td>\n<td><em>Jewelry</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>d100+80</strong></td>\n<td><em>avg. 12,000</em></td>\n<td><em>Regalia</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>01-10</td>\n<td>2d20</td>\n<td>Bone, scrimshaw, beast parts</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11-25</td>\n<td>2d10 x 10</td>\n<td>Glass, shells, or wrought copper, brass, or bronze</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>26-40</td>\n<td>2d4 x 100</td>\n<td>Fine wood, porcelain, or wrought silver</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>41-70</td>\n<td>2d6 x 100</td>\n<td>Alabaster, chryselephantine, ivory, or wrought gold</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>71-80</td>\n<td>3d6 x 100</td>\n<td>Carved jade or wrought platinum</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>81-95</td>\n<td>1d4 x 1,000</td>\n<td>Wrought orichalcum, silver studded with turquoise, moonstone, or opal</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>96-100</td>\n<td>2d4 x 1,000</td>\n<td>Silver studded with jet, amber, or pearl</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>101-125</td>\n<td>3d4 x 1,000</td>\n<td>Gold studded with topaz, jacinth, ruby</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>126-145</td>\n<td>2d8 x 1,000</td>\n<td>Platinum studded with diamond, sapphire, emerald</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>146-155</td>\n<td>3d6 x 1,000</td>\n<td>Electrum or silver pendant with pearls and star rubies</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>156-165</td>\n<td>2d20 x 1,000</td>\n<td>Gold or platinum with diamonds and sapphires</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>166-175</td>\n<td>1d4 x 10,000</td>\n<td>Gold encrusted with flawless facet cut diamonds</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>176-180</td>\n<td>1d8 x 10,000</td>\n<td>Platinum encrusted with flawless black sapphires or blue diamonds</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h6>Special Treasures</h6>\n<p>Not all treasure should be coin, gems, and jewelry. Ancient cities might hold terracotta pottery or rare dyes and pigments. The tombs of ancient kings might have trinkets of carved ivory. Goblin raiders might have captured spices, silk, or rare furs. These items are called <strong>special treasures</strong>.</p>\n<p>To include special treasures in a hoard, first calculate the treasure normally and divide it into lots: 1 piece of jewelry, 1 gem, or 1,000 coins is a lot. Then roll on the table below for each lot of coin, gems, and jewelry and substitute the special treasure rolled for that lot of coin, gems, or jewelry.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: The Judge has just generated a Type L treasure on the Treasure Type (Classic) table. The hoard consists of 4,000cp; 3,000sp; and 4 pieces of jewelry. The Judge wants to place special treasure, so he converts this into 4 lots of copper, 3 lots of silver, and 4 lots of jewelry. Rolling for the copper lots, the Judge gets a “19”, “10”, “16”, and “15”. Three copper lots stay as coin, while one is replaced by 1d3 barrels amphorae of preserved meat. Rolling for the silver lots, the Judge gets a “75”, “12”, and “2017”, and replaces one of the three lots with 1d3 1d2 sacks of loose herbs. Further rolls indicate that 2 pieces of jewelry become rich fur capes. The Judge makes further sub-rolls, and the final treasure is 3,000cp; 2,000sp; 1 barrel of preserved meat (10gp, 16 stone); 2 sacks of loose herbs (75gp, 5 stone each); 2 pieces of jewelry worth 1,100gp each; and 2 rich fur capes worth 700gp and 1,300gp respectively.</p>\n<p>Many of the items appearing as special treasures are designed to be congruent with the types of merchandise appearing on the Merchandise tables in <em><strong>ACKS II* *RR</strong></em> Chapter 8.Players who are not interested in using the mercantile trading system described in that chapter to maximize the return they achieve from selling special treasures are under no obligation to do so. The value listed for the special treasure is its base value as a trade good, and in general it can be sold for that amount without further thought. However, you are within your rights to decide that a special treasure sells for less, or cannot be sold at all, in a market where the demand for that type of merchandise is low. And players might get inspired to pursue mercantile ventures after observing a merchant’s barely-disguised glee when they sell a special treasure for its base value in a market where demand is high!</p>\n<p><strong>Roll 1d20 per 1,000cp</strong></p>\n<p>1 2d20 bags of grain or vegetables, worth 5sp each (4 stone each)</p>\n<p>2 4d6x10 bricks of salt, worth 7cp each (1/2 stone

Sprinkled among the coin will be goods from exotic lands, trophies of monsters and victories won, and possibly even items of legendary power. Bold adventurers may carry off a few choice items and precious metals, but few parties could plunder the full hoard unless they’ve brought an army.</p>\n<p>Along with fame and derring-do, treasure is one of the primary motivations of adventuring parties. Treasure is not only used to retain hirelings and purchase equipment, weapons, vessels, and strongholds; each gold piece worth of treasure brought safely back to civilization gives the character 1 experience point (as described in <em><strong>ACKS II</strong></em><em><strong>RR</strong></em>Chapter 6, <strong>Earning Experience from Adventures</strong>). In most campaigns, experience from treasure recovered on adventures will be the main source of character level advancement. In fact, <em><strong>ACKS</strong></em>assumes that 80% of adventuring XP will come from treasure. Therefore, all of the rules herein are designed and intended to generate a total amount of treasure in any given lair or dungeon equal to four times the XP value of the monsters in the area.</p>\n<p><strong>Designer’s Note:</strong> Many <em><strong>ACKS</strong></em>Judges like to adapt adventures from other D20 fantasy games for use with <em><strong>ACKS</strong></em><em>.</em> (We do this ourselves for our own home campaigns.) However, when you adapt third-party adventures into <em><strong>ACKS</strong></em><em>,</em> be sure to calculate the value of the treasure in those adventures relative to the XP value of the monsters therein. Other D20 fantasy games usually provide much less treasure per monster than <em><strong>ACKS</strong></em>expects. That, in turn, has the unfortunate side-effect of resulting in a much slower advancement curve than <em><strong>ACKS</strong></em>expects. Don’t be alarmed if your players advance in level and wealth in <em><strong>ACKS</strong></em>faster than they do in <em>OSE</em> or <em>LOTFP.</em> They’re supposed to! Because of its deep campaign rules, <em><strong>ACKS</strong></em>has considerably more activities for high-level player characters to undertake with considerably more “money sinks” to drain their accumulated wealth than any other D20 fantasy game.</p>\n"

Each monster entry in the <em><strong>ACKS Monstrous Manual</strong></em> designates whether or not that type of monster has the possibility of treasure. Those that do are given a Treasure Type (TT), which indicates what kinds and quantities of treasure a monster might have. On average, the amount of treasure assigned to a monster by its Treasure Type equals four times its XP.</p>\n<p>The Treasure Types are lettered from A to R, with TT A yielding the smallest hoards and TT R the largest. In addition to their quantitative rank, the Treasure Types are further sub-divided into three categories, representing the method by which the monsters have accumulated the treasure: by <strong>hoarding</strong>, by <strong>raiding</strong>, or <strong>incidentally</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hoarding monsters are typically intelligent enough to appreciate the value of wealth, and powerful enough to gain and defend substantial amounts of it. Hoarder Treasure Types (B, D, H, N, Q, R) feature a roughly equal mix of coins and other valuables, and typically yield values far in excess of their weight.</li>\n<li>Raiding monsters are intelligent creatures who gather treasure by stealing it from those weaker than themselves. Raiders are often the minions of more powerful monster who claim the most precious items for themselves, so Raider Treasure Types (E, G, J, L, O) are mostly bulky hoards of low value coin and goods.</li>\n<li>Monsters with incidental treasure accumulate wealth accidentally, e.g. by bringing dead adventurers back to the lair to feed their young. Though they may lack the intelligence to recognize things of value, they may be attracted to shiny objects which they gather as best they can with their claws or jaws. The Incidental Treasure Types (A, C, F, I, K, M, P) are usually only a few stone in weight and are the most variable type of treasure, with some rolls on these tables yielding fantastic bounty while as many others produce nothing at all.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Because of how the Treasure Types are structured, a dungeon with a variety of monsters will tend to have a wide assortment of interesting treasures, ranging from precious regalia to bulky low value coin.</p>\n<p>You can randomly generate a monster’s treasure using their Treasure Types by rolling on the Treasure Type tables. There are two different Treasure Type tables, the Classic table and the Heroic table. While the tables are equivalent in terms of the total value of treasure provided for each Treasure Type, they differ in two important ways.</p>\n<p>The first difference is in the composition of coin. On the Classic table, low-level hoards consisted mostly of common coin (cp and sp), while high-level hoards consisted mostly of precious coin (gp and pp). On the Heroic table, all hoards consist mostly of common coin, with high-level hoards consisting of a lotof common coin with moderate amounts of precious coin. Thus, treasure hoards generated using the Heroic table are considerably larger in total bulk than those generated on the Classic table.</p>\n<p>For instance, a dragon hoard (TT R) generated on the Treasure Type (Classic) table would typically contain 1750sp, 2100gp, and 3600pp. The same hoard generated on the Treasure Type (Heroic) table would typically contain 19600cp, 14000sp, 5600ep, 4000gp, and 2625pp. The first hoard is worth 20,275gp and weighs 7.5 stone. The second hoard is worth 21,525gp and weighs 46 stone – seven times as much!</p>\n<p>The second difference is in the composition of magic items. On the Classic table, magic items are generated by type (potion, scroll, sword, etc.) while on the Heroic table magic items are generated by rarity (common, rare, etc.). The Classic table tends to provide a great variance in the items that are found. Sometimes low-level monsters may have hoards with powerful magic items, and sometimes high-level monsters may have weak items. The Heroic table tends to provide a greater volume of items with more predictability in power.</p>\n<p>Which Treasure Table to use is up to you, the Judge. The Classic table, as the name implies, is intended to offer treasures similar to those found in classic old-school adventurers popular in the 1970s and 1980s. The Heroic table is intended to offer hoards similar to those found in heroic fantasy literature. You can pick one table and use it for your entire campaign.</p>\n<p>Unless otherwise noted, randomly generated treasures are found only in the monster’s lair. If the monster entry specifies that a creature carries individual treasure either instead of or in addition to its lair treasure, these individual treasures may be found even if the monster is encountered when wandering outside its lair.</p>\n"

      "html": "<p>Since the amount of treasure allowed in the campaign directly controls the speed at which the adventurers level, as well as their overall power and capabilities, it is always up to you to determine how much treasure to place into the campaign. As the Judge, you are never “required” to roll for treasure. In fact, there will be many cases where random treasure generation is not the best method to employ. Whenever you deem it necessary or appropriate, you can and should place treasure by hand or amend random treasures you’ve rolled. Particularly important treasures should always be placed by you deliberately; for example, a magic item crafted by a major antagonist should be tailored to the antagonist’s personality and role in the campaign.</p>\n<p>When creating a dungeon or other adventure area, one easy way to generate treasure is to calculate the sum of all XP from monsters in the area, and then choose a Treasure Type whose average value is close to four times this sum. If the category of this treasure table (hoarder, raider, or incidental) does not seem appropriate to the area, you can instead choose one or more Treasure Types from the appropriate category that have the closest average value. You then can randomly generate treasure for the area using the selected table. Because probabilities are involved, the result may not match the desired value. If the outcome is too much treasure, you can add more monsters or remove some treasure. If too little treasure results, you can make up the difference with special treasures placed by hand. It is also fine to go with high or low results; over time, the law of averages will assert itself.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: An underground crypt has been stocked with 20 skeletons (13 XP each), 1 wight (80 XP), 4 giant bats (29 XP each) and 7 pit vipers (3840 XP each), for a total of 722 XP. The crypt treasure should be around four times that total (4 x 722), or 2,888gp. This is close to the 3,250gp average value of Treasure Type I. Treasure Type I is an incidental type treasure, which seems appropriate for the crypt’s burial goods. Using row I on the Treasure Type table, the Judge rolls 2,000 silver pieces and 5 pieces of jewelry, and places some of this treasure in the coffins guarded by the undead and the rest on the corpse of a bandit at the bottom of a pit trap.</p>\n"

The hoard consists of 4,000cp; 3,000sp; and 4 pieces of jewelry. The Judge wants to place special treasure, so he converts this into 4 lots of copper, 3 lots of silver, and 4 lots of jewelry. Rolling for the copper lots, the Judge gets a “19”, “10”, “16”, and “15”. Three copper lots stay as coin, while one is replaced by 1d3 barrels amphorae of preserved meat.

  "rawMarkdown": "## Treasure\n\nTreasure —- the wage of heroes! A dragon’s or evil sorcerer-king’s hoard will lay glimmering in the torchlight, coin in uncountable volume like the sands of the desert. Sprinkled among the coin will be goods from exotic lands, trophies of monsters and victories won, and possibly even items of legendary power. Bold adventurers may carry off a few choice items and precious metals, but few parties could plunder the full hoard unless they’ve brought an army.\n\nAlong with fame and derring-do, treasure is one of the primary motivations of adventuring parties. Treasure is not only used to retain hirelings and purchase equipment, weapons, vessels, and strongholds; each gold piece worth of treasure brought safely back to civilization gives the character 1 experience point (as described in ***ACKS II******RR***Chapter 6, **Earning Experience from Adventures**). In most campaigns, experience from treasure recovered on adventures will be the main source of character level advancement. In fact, ***ACKS***assumes that 80% of adventuring XP will come from treasure. Therefore, all of the rules herein are designed and intended to generate a total amount of treasure in any given lair or dungeon equal to four times the XP value of the monsters in the area.\n\n**Designer’s Note:** Many ***ACKS***Judges like to adapt adventures from other D20 fantasy games for use with ***ACKS****.* (We do this ourselves for our own home campaigns.) However, when you adapt third-party adventures into ***ACKS****,* be sure to calculate the value of the treasure in those adventures relative to the XP value of the monsters therein. Other D20 fantasy games usually provide much less treasure per monster than ***ACKS***expects. That, in turn, has the unfortunate side-effect of resulting in a much slower advancement curve than ***ACKS***expects. Don’t be alarmed if your players advance in level and wealth in ***ACKS***faster than they do in *OSE* or *LOTFP.* They’re supposed to! Because of its deep campaign rules, ***ACKS***has considerably more activities for high-level player characters to undertake with considerably more “money sinks” to drain their accumulated wealth than any other D20 fantasy game.\n\n### Random Treasure Generation\n\nTreasure will usually be found in the lairs of monsters. Each monster entry in the ***ACKS Monstrous Manual*** designates whether or not that type of monster has the possibility of treasure. Those that do are given a Treasure Type (TT), which indicates what kinds and quantities of treasure a monster might have. On average, the amount of treasure assigned to a monster by its Treasure Type equals four times its XP.\n\nThe Treasure Types are lettered from A to R, with TT A yielding the smallest hoards and TT R the largest. In addition to their quantitative rank, the Treasure Types are further sub-divided into three categories, representing the method by which the monsters have accumulated the treasure: by **hoarding**, by **raiding**, or **incidentally**.\n\n* Hoarding monsters are typically intelligent enough to appreciate the value of wealth, and powerful enough to gain and defend substantial amounts of it. Hoarder Treasure Types (B, D, H, N, Q, R) feature a roughly equal mix of coins and other valuables, and typically yield values far in excess of their weight.\n* Raiding monsters are intelligent creatures who gather treasure by stealing it from those weaker than themselves. Raiders are often the minions of more powerful monster who claim the most precious items for themselves, so Raider Treasure Types (E, G, J, L, O) are mostly bulky hoards of low value coin and goods.\n* Monsters with incidental treasure accumulate wealth accidentally, e.g. by bringing dead adventurers back to the lair to feed their young. Though they may lack the intelligence to recognize things of value, they may be attracted to shiny objects which they gather as best they can with their claws or jaws. The Incidental Treasure Types (A, C, F, I, K, M, P) are usually only a few stone in weight and are the most variable type of treasure, with some rolls on these tables yielding fantastic bounty while as many others produce nothing at all.\n\nBecause of how the Treasure Types are structured, a dungeon with a variety of monsters will tend to have a wide assortment of interesting treasures, ranging from precious regalia to bulky low value coin.\n\nYou can randomly generate a monster’s treasure using their Treasure Types by rolling on the Treasure Type tables. There are two different Treasure Type tables, the Classic table and the Heroic table. While the tables are equivalent in terms of the total value of treasure provided for each Treasure Type, they differ in two important ways.\n\nThe first difference is in the composition of coin. On the Classic table, low-level hoards consisted mostly of common coin (cp and sp), while high-level hoards consisted mostly of precious coin (gp and pp). On the Heroic table, all hoards consist mostly of common coin, with high-level hoards consisting of a lotof common coin with moderate amounts of precious coin. Thus, treasure hoards generated using the Heroic table are considerably larger in total bulk than those generated on the Classic table.\n\nFor instance, a dragon hoard (TT R) generated on the Treasure Type (Classic) table would typically contain 1750sp, 2100gp, and 3600pp. The same hoard generated on the Treasure Type (Heroic) table would typically contain 19600cp, 14000sp, 5600ep, 4000gp, and 2625pp. The first hoard is worth 20,275gp and weighs 7.5 stone. The second hoard is worth 21,525gp and weighs 46 stone – seven times as much!\n\nThe second difference is in the composition of magic items. On the Classic table, magic items are generated by type (potion, scroll, sword, etc.) while on the Heroic table magic items are generated by rarity (common, rare, etc.). The Classic table tends to provide a great variance in the items that are found. Sometimes low-level monsters may have hoards with powerful magic items, and sometimes high-level monsters may have weak items. The Heroic table tends to provide a greater volume of items with more predictability in power.\n\nWhich Treasure Table to use is up to you, the Judge. The Classic table, as the name implies, is intended to offer treasures similar to those found in classic old-school adventurers popular in the 1970s and 1980s. The Heroic table is intended to offer hoards similar to those found in heroic fantasy literature. You can pick one table and use it for your entire campaign.\n\nUnless otherwise noted, randomly generated treasures are found only in the monster’s lair. If the monster entry specifies that a creature carries individual treasure either instead of or in addition to its lair treasure, these individual treasures may be found even if the monster is encountered when wandering outside its lair.\n\n### Planned Treasure Generation\n\nSince the amount of treasure allowed in the campaign directly controls the speed at which the adventurers level, as well as their overall power and capabilities, it is always up to you to determine how much treasure to place into the campaign. As the Judge, you are never “required” to roll for treasure. In fact, there will be many cases where random treasure generation is not the best method to employ. Whenever you deem it necessary or appropriate, you can and should place treasure by hand or amend random treasures you’ve rolled. Particularly important treasures should always be placed by you deliberately; for example, a magic item crafted by a major antagonist should be tailored to the antagonist’s personality and role in the campaign.\n\nWhen creating a dungeon or other adventure area, one easy way to generate treasure is to calculate the sum of all XP from monsters in the area, and then choose a Treasure Type whose average value is close to four times this sum. If the category of this treasure table (hoarder, raider, or incidental) does not seem appropriate to the area, you can instead choose one or more Treasure Types from the appropriate category that have the closest average value. You then can randomly generate treasure for the area using the selected table. Because probabilities are involved, the result may not match the desired value. If the outcome is too much treasure, you can add more monsters or remove some treasure. If too little treasure results, you can make up the difference with special treasures placed by hand. It is also fine to go with high or low results; over time, the law of averages will assert itself.\n\nEXAMPLE: An underground crypt has been stocked with 20 skeletons (13 XP each), 1 wight (80 XP), 4 giant bats (29 XP each) and 7 pit vipers (3840 XP each), for a total of 722 XP. The crypt treasure should be around four times that total (4 x 722), or 2,888gp. This is close to the 3,250gp average value of Treasure Type I. Treasure Type I is an incidental type treasure, which seems appropriate for the crypt’s burial goods. Using row I on the Treasure Type table, the Judge rolls 2,000 silver pieces and 5 pieces of jewelry, and places some of this treasure in the coffins guarded by the undead and the rest on the corpse of a bandit at the bottom of a pit trap.\n\n### Treasure Type Tables\n\nTo use the Treasure Type tables, find the row on your choice of table that corresponds to the monster’s TT. For each column on the row, roll the appropriate dice to determine whether the specified treasure is present, and if so, in what quantity. When the dice indicate that gems, jewelry, or magic items are present, the specific treasures found in these categories are then determined using sub-tables provided after the Treasure Types table. If you wish to create more diverse and interesting treasures, you can then combine the treasure generated into lots and use the Special Treasures table, as described below.\n\n###### Treasure Type Table (Classic)\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Treasure Type & Avg.

Magic items are complex enough to merit their own section (p. XX). Gems, jewelry, and special treasures are detailed below.\n\n###### Gems\n\nWhen gems are found, you can choose or roll for their value in gold pieces on the **Gem Value** table. You can determine one value for all the games in a treasure hoard, divide the gems up into groups and determine different values for each group, or determine the value of each individual gem, as you prefer. The average value of gems is 200gp per gemstone.\n\nGems appearing in a treasure hoard might be specified to be ornamentals or brilliants. Ornamentals have a value between 10 - 50gp (average 30gp), and can be randomly generated by rolling 2d20 on the chart below. Brilliants are between 500 - 10,000gp (average 4,000gp), and can be randomly generated by rolling 1d100 + 80. The Treasure Type table uses the most valuable gems to minimize the number of rolls on the gem sub-table for Judges who are randomizing each separately; if you want to create a hoard consisting of more lower value gems, you can convert each brilliant to 11 gems, and each gem to 7 ornamentals.\n\nEXAMPLE: The Judge’s results for TT Q indicate that 3 brilliants are present in a hoard. Seeing that their average value is 5,000gp each, the Judge could actually place this 15,000gp in gems as one 10,000gp flawless blue diamond, three 1,000gp rubies, four 250gp pearls, and ten 10gp quartz crystals, or any other combination desired.\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Roll** | **Gem Value (gp)** | **Type** |\n| **2d20** | *avg. 30* | *Ornamental* |\n| **d100** | *avg. 200* | *Gem* |\n| **d100+80** | *avg. 4,000* | *Brilliant* |\n| 01-10 | 10 | Azurite, hematite, malachite, obsidian, quartz |\n| 11-25 | 25 | Agate, lapis lazuli, tiger eye, turquoise |\n| 26-40 | 50 | Bloodstone, crystal, citrine, jasper, moonstone, onyx |\n| 41-55 | 75 | Carnelian, chalcedony, sardonyx, zircon |\n| 56-70 | 100 | Amber, amethyst, coral, jade, jet, tourmaline |\n| 71-80 | 250 | Garnet, pearl, spinel |\n| 81-90 | 500 | Aquamarine, alexandrite, topaz |\n| 91-95 | 750 | Opal, star ruby, star sapphire, sunset amethyst, imperial topaz |\n| 96-100 | 1,000 | Black sapphire, diamond, emerald, jacinth, ruby |\n| 101-110 | 1,500 | Amber with preserved extinct creatures, whorled nephrite jade |\n| 111-125 | 2,000 | Black pearl, baroque pearl, crystal geode |\n| 126-145 | 4,000 | Facet cut imperial topaz, flawless diamond |\n| 146-165 | 6,000 | Facet cut star sapphire or star ruby |\n| 166-175 | 8,000 | Flawless facet cut diamond, emerald, jacinth or ruby |\n| 176-180 | 10,000 | Flawless facet cut black sapphire or blue diamond |\n\n###### Jewelry\n\nJewelry can vary in value in a similar manner to gems. You can choose or roll for the value of jewelry in a treasure hoard on the **Jewelry Value** table. The average value of jewelry is 1,000gp per piece.\n\nJewelry appearing in a treasure hoard might be specified to be trinkets or regalia. Trinkets have values of 2-800gp (average 225gp), and can be randomly generated by rolling 2d20 on the chart below. Regalia values range from 1,000-80,000gp (average 12,000gp) and can be randomly generated using 1d100 + 80. The treasure charts give jewelry treasures using the most valuable unit of jewelry for the convenience of randomizing each one separately; if you want to use average values to generate a larger quantity of jewelry, you can convert each piece of regalia to 12 pieces of jewelry, each of which may be in turn converted to 4 trinkets.\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Roll** | **Jewelry Value (gp)** | **Type** |\n| **2d20** | *avg. 225* | *Trinkets* |\n| **d100** | *avg. 1,000* | *Jewelry* |\n| **d100+80** | *avg. 12,000* | *Regalia* |\n| 01-10 | 2d20 | Bone, scrimshaw, beast parts |\n| 11-25 | 2d10 x 10 | Glass, shells, or wrought copper, brass, or bronze |\n| 26-40 | 2d4 x 100 | Fine wood, porcelain, or wrought silver |\n| 41-70 | 2d6 x 100 | Alabaster, chryselephantine, ivory, or wrought gold |\n| 71-80 | 3d6 x 100 | Carved jade or wrought platinum |\n| 81-95 | 1d4 x 1,000 | Wrought orichalcum, silver studded with turquoise, moonstone, or opal |\n| 96-100 | 2d4 x 1,000 | Silver studded with jet, amber, or pearl |\n| 101-125 | 3d4 x 1,000 | Gold studded with topaz, jacinth, ruby |\n| 126-145 | 2d8 x 1,000 | Platinum studded with diamond, sapphire, emerald |\n| 146-155 | 3d6 x 1,000 | Electrum or silver pendant with pearls and star rubies |\n| 156-165 | 2d20 x 1,000 | Gold or platinum with diamonds and sapphires |\n| 166-175 | 1d4 x 10,000 | Gold encrusted with flawless facet cut diamonds |\n| 176-180 | 1d8 x 10,000 | Platinum encrusted with flawless black sapphires or blue diamonds |\n\n###### Special Treasures\n\nNot all treasure should be coin, gems, and jewelry. Ancient cities might hold terracotta pottery or rare dyes and pigments. The tombs of ancient kings might have trinkets of carved ivory. Goblin raiders might have captured spices, silk, or rare furs. These items are called **special treasures**.\n\nTo include special treasures in a hoard, first calculate the treasure normally and divide it into lots: 1 piece of jewelry, 1 gem, or 1,000 coins is a lot. Then roll on the table below for each lot of coin, gems, and jewelry and substitute the special treasure rolled for that lot of coin, gems, or jewelry.\n\nEXAMPLE: The Judge has just generated a Type L treasure on the Treasure Type (Classic) table. The hoard consists of 4,000cp; 3,000sp; and 4 pieces of jewelry. The Judge wants to place special treasure, so he converts this into 4 lots of copper, 3 lots of silver, and 4 lots of jewelry. Rolling for the copper lots, the Judge gets a “19”, “10”, “16”, and “15”. Three copper lots stay as coin, while one is replaced by 1d3 barrels amphorae of preserved meat. Rolling for the silver lots, the Judge gets a “75”, “12”, and “2017”, and replaces one of the three lots with 1d3 1d2 sacks of loose herbs. Further rolls indicate that 2 pieces of jewelry become rich fur capes. The Judge makes further sub-rolls, and the final treasure is 3,000cp; 2,000sp; 1 barrel of preserved meat (10gp, 16 stone); 2 sacks of loose herbs (75gp, 5 stone each); 2 pieces of jewelry worth 1,100gp each; and 2 rich fur capes worth 700gp and 1,300gp respectively.\n\nMany of the items appearing as special treasures are designed to be congruent with the types of merchandise appearing on the Merchandise tables in ***ACKS II* *RR*** Chapter 8.Players who are not interested in using the mercantile trading system described in that chapter to maximize the return they achieve from selling special treasures are under no obligation to do so. The value listed for the special treasure is its base value as a trade good, and in general it can be sold for that amount without further thought. However, you are within your rights to decide that a special treasure sells for less, or cannot be sold at all, in a market where the demand for that type of merchandise is low. And players might get inspired to pursue mercantile ventures after observing a merchant’s barely-disguised glee when they sell a special treasure for its base value in a market where demand is high!\n\n**Roll 1d20 per 1,000cp**\n\n1 2d20 bags of grain or vegetables, worth 5sp each (4 stone each)\n\n2 4d6x10 bricks of salt, worth 7cp each (1/2 stone each)\n\n3 2d10 amphorae of beer, worth
