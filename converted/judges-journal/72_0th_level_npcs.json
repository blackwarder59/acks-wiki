You can use the following rules to generate 0th level characters.</p>\n<h3>Occupation</h3>\n<p>The first step in creating a 0th level NPC is to determine his occupation. A 0th level NPC might be anything from a court astrologer, a kitchen scullion, a hard-bitten mercenary, to a burly blacksmith. The number of classes in <em><strong>ACKS II</strong></em> is dwarfed by the number of possible occupations that might be held by the 0th level NPCs in the game world!</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you are generating an occupant of a settlement building, their occupations will be have already been determined using the Building Occupant tables (p. XX) when you created the building.</li>\n<li>If you are generating a prospective henchman, you can choose or roll for their occupation on the General/Street column of the Random Building Occupant by Building Type table (p. XX). Re-roll results of 84-85, 96-97, and 99.</li>\n<li>If you are generating a mercenary or specialist, their occupation will always be their troop type or specialty.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>EXAMPLE: The adventurers have solicited henchmen in a Class V town and one 0th level character has responded. The Judge needs to generate this prospective henchmen. He starts by rolling on General/Street column of the Random Building Occupant by Building Type table. The roll is an 77, so the NPC is a laborer. Rolling on the Laborer Occupation sub-table, the Judge gets a 74 – the NPC’s occupation is sawyer/woodcutter.</p>\n<h3>Attributes</h3>\n<p>When you create a 0th level character, you can use any of the following methods to generate their attribute scores:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Assign each of the NPC’s attributes a score between 9 and 11. The NPC has no attribute bonuses or penalties.</li>\n<li>Assign four of the NPCs’ attributes a score between 9 and 11. Assign one an 8 (-1) and another a 13 (+1).</li>\n<li>Roll 3d6 in order (STR, INT, WIL, DEX, CON, CHA) and record the NPCs’ attributes. Swap any two if sensible for the NPC given his occupation or likely future class. This is the best option to use for henchmen prospects.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>if you want to generate a 0th level character with better-than-average talent or aptitude, use one of the recommended options for player characters (see p. XX).</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: The Judge is rolling attributes for a 0th level woodcutter. He decides to just roll 3d6 in order for his attributes. His rolls are STR 9, INT 13, WIL 11, DEX 10, CON 8, CHA 11. Given that woodcutting requires hard labor he decides to swap INT and CON. The woodcutter isn’t the strongest or the smartest, but he has the endurance to work the job. The Judge notes that explorer might be the best class for the woodcutter to advance into if he gains XP, since CON is the explorer’s primary attribute.</p>\n<h3>Armor Class, Hit Dice, Speed, Attack Throws, and Saving Throws</h3>\n<p>Like adventurers, 0th level NPCs have base Armor Class scores of 0 and Speeds of 40’ / 120’ / 360’. Their attack throws and saving throws are calculated by HD, as modified by their race. 0th level NPCs have hit dice determined by their race. Humans have ½ HD, or 1-1 HD if trained as mercenaries. Dwarves have ½ HD, or 1-1 HD if militia. Elves have 1-1 HD, or 1 HD if militia. However, noncombatants (such as expectant mothers or disabled elderly) will have worse characteristics. The table below summarizes this data. The <em><strong>ACKS II</strong></em><em><strong>Monstrous Manual</strong></em>has detailed entries for NPCs.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Race</td>\n<td>Noncombatant</td>\n<td>Commoner</td>\n<td>Milita/Mercenary</td>\n<td>Fighter 1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Dwarf</td>\n<td>¼ HD (1 hp)</td>\n<td>½ HD (1d4 hp)</td>\n<td>1-1 HD (1d8-1 hp)</td>\n<td>1 HD (1d8 hp)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Elf</td>\n<td>¼ HD (1d2 hp)</td>\n<td>1-1 HD (1d6 hp)</td>\n<td>1 HD (1d8 hp)</td>\n<td>1+1 HD (1d8+1 hp)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Human</td>\n<td>¼ HD (1 hp)</td>\n<td>½ HD (1d4 hp)</td>\n<td>1-1 HD (1d8-1 hp)</td>\n<td>1 HD (1d8 hp)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>EXAMPLE: The woodcutter’s characteristics are AC 0, Speed 40’ / 120’ / 360’, HD 1/2, attack throw 11+, save F0. Because of his 13 CON, he’ll get one extra hit point. If the woodcutter had previously been trained as a mercenary, he would have 1-1 HD. If the woodcutter were an expectant mother, she’d have ¼ HD.</p>\n<h3>Proficiencies</h3>\n<p>0th level characters will begin with anywhere from 4 to 15 proficiencies. (If they have 16 proficiencies or more, they’re leveled characters.) These proficiencies can be combat proficiencies, general proficiencies, or even class proficiencies. You can choose the proficiencies for the NPC using your judgment, or use the Proficiencies by Occupation tables, below, to determine them.</p>\n<h4>General Proficiencies</h4>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Proficiencies</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Human</strong>  <strong>Age</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Dwarf</strong>  <strong>Age</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Elf</strong>  <strong>Age</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Nobiran</strong>  <strong>Age</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Zaharan</strong>  <strong>Age</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>1</strong></td>\n<td>9-12</td>\n<td>9-12</td>\n<td>9-12</td>\n<td>9-12</td>\n<td>9-12</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>2</strong></td>\n<td>13-15</td>\n<td>13-19</td>\n<td>13-25</td>\n<td>13-15</td>\n<td>13-15</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>3</strong></td>\n<td>16-17</td>\n<td>20-25</td>\n<td>26-50</td>\n<td>16-17</td>\n<td>16-17</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>4</strong></td>\n<td>18-22</td>\n<td>26-30</td>\n<td>51-55</td>\n<td>18-22</td>\n<td>18-22</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>5</strong></td>\n<td>23-32</td>\n<td>31-40</td>\n<td>56-65</td>\n<td>23-32</td>\n<td>23-32</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>6</strong></td>\n<td>33-52</td>\n<td>41-50</td>\n<td>66-85</td>\n<td>33-52</td>\n<td>33-52</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>7</strong></td>\n<td>53-87</td>\n<td>61-95</td>\n<td>86-120</td>\n<td>53-98</td>\n<td>53-87</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>8</strong></td>\n<td>88+</td>\n<td>96+</td>\n<td>121+</td>\n<td>99+</td>\n<td>88+</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>When they reach adulthood, 0th level humans and demi-humans of average Intellect have four general proficiencies. (Youth have proportionately fewer.) Usually one of these is a proficiency associated with their occupation. The others are ancillary skills acquired while growing up.</p>\n<p>0th level characters thereafter gain an additional general proficiency after 5 years, 15 years, 35 years, and 70 years of work. Usually these are additional ranks in their occupation’s proficiency, but they can be avocations, hobbies, or new . If their INT is 13 or greater, the adults can gain additional general proficiencies equal to their IINT bonus. An NPC cannot select the same proficiency more than once with his four starting proficiencies, but can use bonus proficiencies from high INT or years of work experience to do so.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: The woodcutter is a young man with four general proficiencies. His occupational proficiency is Labor (woodcutting). The Judge decides to “double down” on his CON score, and select Endurance as well. That uses up two of his four proficiencies.</p>\n<h4>Class Proficiencies</h4>\n<p>Occasionally, 0th level characters might have one class proficiency instead of or in addition to a general proficiency. This usually represents either a rare natural talent (such as Prophecy) or specialized training at a military academy, seminary, wizard’s college, and so on.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: The woodcutter is just an ordinary lumberjack so he has no class proficiencies.</p>\n<h4>Combat Proficiencies</h4>\n<p>Most 0th level characters are <strong>noncombatants</strong>.Noncombatants have ML scores of -2 and have only one combat proficiency: single weapon fighting style. (They know how to pick something up and bash someone with it or throw it.) Because they have no weapon proficiencies, they always suffer a -1 penalty to their attack throw by HD with whatever they use.</p>\n<p>Some 0th level characters are <strong>combatants</strong> with combat proficiencies. These NPCs can wear armor and wield weapons in which they are proficient with relative effectiveness. Their morale scores will range from -1 to +1.</p>\n<p>0th level characters who belong to military occupations (or who receive training from a marshal) will have numerous combat proficiencies in addition to their general proficiencies. 0th level characters who do not belong to military occupations must count any combat proficiencies against their general proficiencies.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: Since the woodcutter spends all day cutting down trees with a hatchet, the Judge decides that the woodcutter has weapon proficiency with axes and fighting style proficiency with two-handed weapons. That is two proficiencies, and uses up his four proficiency slots.</p>\n<h4>Proficiencies by Occupation</h4>\n<p>The following tables can be used to quickly assign proficiencies to NPCs based on their occupation. The first proficiency listed is always the core proficiency for the NPC’s occupation. The remaining proficiencies can represent career-related skills, avocations, local lore, specialized training, etc. If you don’t know the NPC’s occupation you can roll for it on the tables on p. XX – p. XX.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Entertainers</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Proficiencies</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Actor</td>\n<td>Performance (acting), Folkways, Streetwise, Weapon Proficiency (swords &amp; daggers)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Dancer</td>\n<td>Performance (dance), Folkways, Seduction, Streetwise</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Musician</td>\n<td>Performance (sing/instrument), Folkways, Revelry, Streetwise</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Singer</td>\n<td>Performance (sing/instrument), Folkways, Seduction, Streetwise</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Carouser</td>\n<td>Gambling, Folkways, Revelry, Streetwise</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>Apprentice entertainers will have one rank in Performance, journeyman will have two ranks, and masters will have three ranks.

Obviously, many 0th level NPCs will be much older than 1st level adventurers. Most people do not set out as youths in search of danger nor do they devote themselves to their careers with absolute intensity. Feel free to add 1d6, 1d10, or even 2d10 years of age to more placid NPCs.</p>\n<p><strong>Designer’s Note:</strong> Based on the demographic data we developed for the Economics of Aurëpos, the average human is around 25 years old. A typical peasant or urban family includes a 38-year old father, a 32-year old mother, a 13-year old child, an 8-year old child, a 5-year old child. There might also be a 48-year old grandparent or relative and a 32- year old sibling. They will have buried two children, one 2-year old and one 11-year old. Obviously no actual peasant family is exactly “average” so the variations will be great, perhaps +/-1d10 years in either direction for the family as a whole.</p>\n<h3>Advancement to 1st Level</h3>\n<p>The amount of XP required to advance for a 0th level character to advance to 1st level is equal to (16 – number of proficiencies) x 60. If you don’t know the exact number of proficiencies an NPC has, assume he requires 500 XP to advance to 1st level.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: A cataphract and a gongfarmer become henchmen and start adventuring. The cataphract has 11 proficiencies, so he needs just (16 – 11) x 60 = 300 XP to reach 1st level. The gongfarmer has just 4 proficiencies, so he needs (16 – 4) x 60 = 720 XP to reach 1st level. As a highly-trained military soldier, the cataphract requires much less time and experience to gain the skills needed.</p>\n<p>A 0th level character can earn experience points from adventurers or campaign activities.</p>\n<p><strong>Adventures:</strong> A 0th level character who participates in an adventure will earn experience points as a henchman.</p>\n<p><strong>Magical Research:</strong> A 0th level apprentice who studies under an arcane spellcaster of 9th level or higher can become 1st level mages. The apprentice must first undertake dedicated study. Assuming he starts with 4 proficiencies, he needs (12 x 60) = 720 XP to advance. If he studies at 6 days per week, with a research rate of 2.5gp per day, it will take 49 weeks, about a year). He then must make a research throw of 18+ (modified by INT). If the throw succeeds, the apprentice advances to 1st level. If the throw fails on an unmodified 1-3, the apprentice becomes discouraged by his inaptitude for magic and leaves the mage’s service. On any other result, the apprentice fails to advance in level and loses all of the accumulated campaign XP, but can continue his studies.</p>\n<p><strong>Domain and Mercantile Income:</strong> A 0th level character can earn XP from domain and mercantile income. They are treated as if they had an XP Threshold of 25gp. The character will advance into a type of class appropriate to way the XP was earned. For instance, a petty noble’s son (0th level character) who inherits his father’s small domain (125gp per month) will earn 50 XP per month (125gp – 25gp), advancing to become a 1st level fighter after 5 months as serving as baron (if bandits don’t kill him first).</p>\n<p><strong>Hijinks:</strong> A 0th level character can earn XP from perpetrating hijinks (usually carousing or racketeering). When the 0th level character earns 500xp from hijinks, he can become a 1st level assassin, nightblade, or thief. Which class will depend on his race (only elves may be nightblades) and the sort of company the character is keeping. On average, it takes 0th level characters several years of consorting with unsavory sorts in dimly-lit taverns to advance to become a “real” thief.</p>\n<p>When a 0th level character advances to 1st level, he gains the Adventuring proficiency and the attack throws, saving throws, class powers, and proficiencies of his new class. The character re-rolls his hit points using his new class’s Hit Die, keeping either his new hp total or his prior hp total +1 if it was higher.</p>\n<p>The new 1st level character retains any proficiencies he already knew. If these proficiencies are equivalent to any of the class powers of his new class, they are replaced by the newly-gained class powers. If the proficiencies are not part of his class powers, they count against his limit of proficiencies from level, INT and/or time and training (p. XX). If he has more general proficiencies than permitted by level, INT, and time and training, he loses one proficiency each month of game time, representing the erosion of his old professional skills over time. If he has more class proficiencies than permitted, or class proficiencies not permitted to his class at all, he loses them when he advances to 1st level.</p>\n",

A typical peasant or urban family includes a 38-year old father, a 32-year old mother, a 13-year old child, an 8-year old child, a 5-year old child. There might also be a 48-year old grandparent or relative and a 32- year old sibling. They will have buried two children, one 2-year old and one 11-year old. Obviously no actual peasant family is exactly “average” so the variations will be great, perhaps +/-1d10 years in either direction for the family as a whole.</p>\n"

      "title": "Advancement to 1st Level",

      "html": "<p>The amount of XP required to advance for a 0th level character to advance to 1st level is equal to (16 – number of proficiencies) x 60. If you don’t know the exact number of proficiencies an NPC has, assume he requires 500 XP to advance to 1st level.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: A cataphract and a gongfarmer become henchmen and start adventuring. The cataphract has 11 proficiencies, so he needs just (16 – 11) x 60 = 300 XP to reach 1st level. The gongfarmer has just 4 proficiencies, so he needs (16 – 4) x 60 = 720 XP to reach 1st level. As a highly-trained military soldier, the cataphract requires much less time and experience to gain the skills needed.</p>\n<p>A 0th level character can earn experience points from adventurers or campaign activities.</p>\n<p><strong>Adventures:</strong> A 0th level character who participates in an adventure will earn experience points as a henchman.</p>\n<p><strong>Magical Research:</strong> A 0th level apprentice who studies under an arcane spellcaster of 9th level or higher can become 1st level mages. The apprentice must first undertake dedicated study. Assuming he starts with 4 proficiencies, he needs (12 x 60) = 720 XP to advance. If he studies at 6 days per week, with a research rate of 2.5gp per day, it will take 49 weeks, about a year). He then must make a research throw of 18+ (modified by INT). If the throw succeeds, the apprentice advances to 1st level. If the throw fails on an unmodified 1-3, the apprentice becomes discouraged by his inaptitude for magic and leaves the mage’s service. On any other result, the apprentice fails to advance in level and loses all of the accumulated campaign XP, but can continue his studies.</p>\n<p><strong>Domain and Mercantile Income:</strong> A 0th level character can earn XP from domain and mercantile income. They are treated as if they had an XP Threshold of 25gp. The character will advance into a type of class appropriate to way the XP was earned. For instance, a petty noble’s son (0th level character) who inherits his father’s small domain (125gp per month) will earn 50 XP per month (125gp – 25gp), advancing to become a 1st level fighter after 5 months as serving as baron (if bandits don’t kill him first).</p>\n<p><strong>Hijinks:</strong> A 0th level character can earn XP from perpetrating hijinks (usually carousing or racketeering). When the 0th level character earns 500xp from hijinks, he can become a 1st level assassin, nightblade, or thief. Which class will depend on his race (only elves may be nightblades) and the sort of company the character is keeping. On average, it takes 0th level characters several years of consorting with unsavory sorts in dimly-lit taverns to advance to become a “real” thief.</p>\n<p>When a 0th level character advances to 1st level, he gains the Adventuring proficiency and the attack throws, saving throws, class powers, and proficiencies of his new class. The character re-rolls his hit points using his new class’s Hit Die, keeping either his new hp total or his prior hp total +1 if it was higher.</p>\n<p>The new 1st level character retains any proficiencies he already knew. If these proficiencies are equivalent to any of the class powers of his new class, they are replaced by the newly-gained class powers. If the proficiencies are not part of his class powers, they count against his limit of proficiencies from level, INT and/or time and training (p. XX). If he has more general proficiencies than permitted by level, INT, and time and training, he loses one proficiency each month of game time, representing the erosion of his old professional skills over time. If he has more class proficiencies than permitted, or class proficiencies not permitted to his class at all, he loses them when he advances to 1st level.</p>\n"

  "rawMarkdown": "## 0th Level NPCs\n\nIn the early stages of your campaign, most of the NPCs you generate will be 0th level characters – a mix of prospective henchmen, local merchants, mercenaries, ruffians, and specialists. You can use the following rules to generate 0th level characters.\n\n### Occupation\n\nThe first step in creating a 0th level NPC is to determine his occupation. A 0th level NPC might be anything from a court astrologer, a kitchen scullion, a hard-bitten mercenary, to a burly blacksmith. The number of classes in ***ACKS II*** is dwarfed by the number of possible occupations that might be held by the 0th level NPCs in the game world!\n\n* If you are generating an occupant of a settlement building, their occupations will be have already been determined using the Building Occupant tables (p. XX) when you created the building.\n* If you are generating a prospective henchman, you can choose or roll for their occupation on the General/Street column of the Random Building Occupant by Building Type table (p. XX). Re-roll results of 84-85, 96-97, and 99.\n* If you are generating a mercenary or specialist, their occupation will always be their troop type or specialty.\n\nEXAMPLE: The adventurers have solicited henchmen in a Class V town and one 0th level character has responded. The Judge needs to generate this prospective henchmen. He starts by rolling on General/Street column of the Random Building Occupant by Building Type table. The roll is an 77, so the NPC is a laborer. Rolling on the Laborer Occupation sub-table, the Judge gets a 74 – the NPC’s occupation is sawyer/woodcutter.\n\n### Attributes\n\nWhen you create a 0th level character, you can use any of the following methods to generate their attribute scores:\n\n* Assign each of the NPC’s attributes a score between 9 and 11. The NPC has no attribute bonuses or penalties.\n* Assign four of the NPCs’ attributes a score between 9 and 11. Assign one an 8 (-1) and another a 13 (+1).\n* Roll 3d6 in order (STR, INT, WIL, DEX, CON, CHA) and record the NPCs’ attributes. Swap any two if sensible for the NPC given his occupation or likely future class. This is the best option to use for henchmen prospects.\n\nif you want to generate a 0th level character with better-than-average talent or aptitude, use one of the recommended options for player characters (see p. XX).\n\nEXAMPLE: The Judge is rolling attributes for a 0th level woodcutter. He decides to just roll 3d6 in order for his attributes. His rolls are STR 9, INT 13, WIL 11, DEX 10, CON 8, CHA 11. Given that woodcutting requires hard labor he decides to swap INT and CON. The woodcutter isn’t the strongest or the smartest, but he has the endurance to work the job. The Judge notes that explorer might be the best class for the woodcutter to advance into if he gains XP, since CON is the explorer’s primary attribute.\n\n### Armor Class, Hit Dice, Speed, Attack Throws, and Saving Throws\n\nLike adventurers, 0th level NPCs have base Armor Class scores of 0 and Speeds of 40’ / 120’ / 360’. Their attack throws and saving throws are calculated by HD, as modified by their race. 0th level NPCs have hit dice determined by their race. Humans have ½ HD, or 1-1 HD if trained as mercenaries. Dwarves have ½ HD, or 1-1 HD if militia. Elves have 1-1 HD, or 1 HD if militia. However, noncombatants (such as expectant mothers or disabled elderly) will have worse characteristics. The table below summarizes this data. The ***ACKS II******Monstrous Manual***has detailed entries for NPCs.\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Race | Noncombatant | Commoner | Milita/Mercenary | Fighter 1 |\n| Dwarf | ¼ HD (1 hp) | ½ HD (1d4 hp) | 1-1 HD (1d8-1 hp) | 1 HD (1d8 hp) |\n| Elf | ¼ HD (1d2 hp) | 1-1 HD (1d6 hp) | 1 HD (1d8 hp) | 1+1 HD (1d8+1 hp) |\n| Human | ¼ HD (1 hp) | ½ HD (1d4 hp) | 1-1 HD (1d8-1 hp) | 1 HD (1d8 hp) |\n\nEXAMPLE: The woodcutter’s characteristics are AC 0, Speed 40’ / 120’ / 360’, HD 1/2, attack throw 11+, save F0. Because of his 13 CON, he’ll get one extra hit point. If the woodcutter had previously been trained as a mercenary, he would have 1-1 HD. If the woodcutter were an expectant mother, she’d have ¼ HD.\n\n### Proficiencies\n\n0th level characters will begin with anywhere from 4 to 15 proficiencies. (If they have 16 proficiencies or more, they’re leveled characters.) These proficiencies can be combat proficiencies, general proficiencies, or even class proficiencies. You can choose the proficiencies for the NPC using your judgment, or use the Proficiencies by Occupation tables, below, to determine them.\n\n#### General Proficiencies\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Proficiencies** | **Human**  **Age** | **Dwarf**  **Age** | **Elf**  **Age** | **Nobiran**  **Age** | **Zaharan**  **Age** |\n| **1** | 9-12 | 9-12 | 9-12 | 9-12 | 9-12 |\n| **2** | 13-15 | 13-19 | 13-25 | 13-15 | 13-15 |\n| **3** | 16-17 | 20-25 | 26-50 | 16-17 | 16-17 |\n| **4** | 18-22 | 26-30 | 51-55 | 18-22 | 18-22 |\n| **5** | 23-32 | 31-40 | 56-65 | 23-32 | 23-32 |\n| **6** | 33-52 | 41-50 | 66-85 | 33-52 | 33-52 |\n| **7** | 53-87 | 61-95 | 86-120 | 53-98 | 53-87 |\n| **8** | 88+ | 96+ | 121+ | 99+ | 88+ |\n\nWhen they reach adulthood, 0th level humans and demi-humans of average Intellect have four general proficiencies. (Youth have proportionately fewer.) Usually one of these is a proficiency associated with their occupation. The others are ancillary skills acquired while growing up.\n\n0th level characters thereafter gain an additional general proficiency after 5 years, 15 years, 35 years, and 70 years of work. Usually these are additional ranks in their occupation’s proficiency, but they can be avocations, hobbies, or new . If their INT is 13 or greater, the adults can gain additional general proficiencies equal to their IINT bonus. An NPC cannot select the same proficiency more than once with his four starting proficiencies, but can use bonus proficiencies from high INT or years of work experience to do so.\n\nEXAMPLE: The woodcutter is a young man with four general proficiencies. His occupational proficiency is Labor (woodcutting). The Judge decides to “double down” on his CON score, and select Endurance as well. That uses up two of his four proficiencies.\n\n#### Class Proficiencies\n\nOccasionally, 0th level characters might have one class proficiency instead of or in addition to a general proficiency. This usually represents either a rare natural talent (such as Prophecy) or specialized training at a military academy, seminary, wizard’s college, and so on.\n\nEXAMPLE: The woodcutter is just an ordinary lumberjack so he has no class proficiencies.\n\n#### Combat Proficiencies\n\nMost 0th level characters are **noncombatants**.Noncombatants have ML scores of -2 and have only one combat proficiency: single weapon fighting style. (They know how to pick something up and bash someone with it or throw it.) Because they have no weapon proficiencies, they always suffer a -1 penalty to their attack throw by HD with whatever they use.\n\nSome 0th level characters are **combatants** with combat proficiencies. These NPCs can wear armor and wield weapons in which they are proficient with relative effectiveness. Their morale scores will range from -1 to +1.\n\n0th level characters who belong to military occupations (or who receive training from a marshal) will have numerous combat proficiencies in addition to their general proficiencies. 0th level characters who do not belong to military occupations must count any combat proficiencies against their general proficiencies.\n\nEXAMPLE: Since the woodcutter spends all day cutting down trees with a hatchet, the Judge decides that the woodcutter has weapon proficiency with axes and fighting style proficiency with two-handed weapons. That is two proficiencies, and uses up his four proficiency slots.\n\n#### Proficiencies by Occupation\n\nThe following tables can be used to quickly assign proficiencies to NPCs based on their occupation. The first proficiency listed is always the core proficiency for the NPC’s occupation. The remaining proficiencies can represent career-related skills, avocations, local lore, specialized training, etc. If you don’t know the NPC’s occupation you can roll for it on the tables on p. XX – p. XX.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Entertainers** | **Proficiencies** |\n| Actor | Performance (acting), Folkways, Streetwise, Weapon Proficiency (swords & daggers) |\n| Dancer | Performance (dance), Folkways, Seduction, Streetwise |\n| Musician | Performance (sing/instrument), Folkways, Revelry, Streetwise |\n| Singer | Performance (sing/instrument), Folkways, Seduction, Streetwise |\n| Carouser | Gambling, Folkways, Revelry, Streetwise |\n\nApprentice entertainers will have one rank in Performance, journeyman will have two ranks, and masters will have three ranks. Actors are assumed to have Weapon Proficiency (swords & daggers) from stage fighting, but feel free to substitute another proficiency more appropriate to a particular entertainer.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Merchants** | **Proficiencies** |\n| Bookseller | Profession (merchant), Craft (scribe), Bargaining, Folkways |\n| Chandler/Upholder | Profession (merchant), Craft (candlemaking), Bargaining, Folkways |\n| Coppermonger | Profession (merchant), Craft (coppersmithing), Bargaining, Folkways |\n| Cornmonger | Profession (merchant), Labor (farming), Bargaining, Folkways |\n| Draper | Profession (merchant), Craft (weaving), Bargaining, Folkways |\n| Fishmonger | Profession (merchant), Labor (fishing), Bargaining, Folkways |\n| Fripperer | Profession (merchant), Craft (tailoring), Bargaining, Folkways |\n| Furrier | Profession (merchant), Trapping, Bargaining, Folkways |\n| Greengrocer | Profession (merchant), Labor (farming), Bargaining, Folkways |\n| Horsemonger | Profession (merchant), Animal Training, Bargaining, Riding |\n| Ironmonger | Profession (merchant), Craft (blacksmithing), Bargaining, Folkways |\n| Lawyer | Profession (lawyer), Bargaining, Diplomacy, Intimidation |\n| Lumbermonger | Profession (merchant), Bargaining, Labor (lumberjacking), Folkways |\n| Mercer | Profession (merchant), Craft (weaving), Bargaining, Folkways |\n| Oilmonger | Profession (merchant), Craft (bottling), Bargaining, Folkways |\n| Peltmonger/Skinner | Profession (merchant), Craft (tanning), Bargaining, Folkways |\n| Poulterer | Profession (merchant), Animal Husbandry, Bargaining, Folkways |\n| Salter/Pepperer | Profession (merchant), Craft (cooking), Bargaining, Folkways |\n| Vintner | Profession (merchant), Craft (winemaking), Bargaining, Folkways |\n\nApprentice merchants will have one rank in their Profession, licensed merchants will have two ranks, and master merchants will have three ranks.

Note that most artisans do not have Bargaining proficiency. Adventurers who purchase directly from artisanal suppliers can get better prices than those that rely on mercantile middlemen.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Hostellers** | **Proficiencies** |\n| Brothelkeeper | Profession (brothelkeeper), Folkways, Intimidation, Streetwise, Weapon Prof. (club, dagger, sap, whip) |\n| Cantinakeeper | Profession (cantinakeeper), Folkways, Labor (cooking), Revelry, Streetwise |\n| Innkeeper | Profession (innkeeper), Craft (brewing), Folkways, Revelry, Streetwise, |\n| Tavernkeeper | Profession (tavernkeeper), Craft (brewing), Folkways, Revelry, Streetwise |\n\nA hosteller’s ranks in their Profession proficiency are based on the size of the establishment they operate.

Obviously, many 0th level NPCs will be much older than 1st level adventurers. Most people do not set out as youths in search of danger nor do they devote themselves to their careers with absolute intensity. Feel free to add 1d6, 1d10, or even 2d10 years of age to more placid NPCs.\n\n**Designer’s Note:** Based on the demographic data we developed for the Economics of Aurëpos, the average human is around 25 years old. A typical peasant or urban family includes a 38-year old father, a 32-year old mother, a 13-year old child, an 8-year old child, a 5-year old child. There might also be a 48-year old grandparent or relative and a 32- year old sibling. They will have buried two children, one 2-year old and one 11-year old. Obviously no actual peasant family is exactly “average” so the variations will be great, perhaps +/-1d10 years in either direction for the family as a whole.\n\n### Advancement to 1st Level\n\nThe amount of XP required to advance for a 0th level character to advance to 1st level is equal to (16 – number of proficiencies) x 60. If you don’t know the exact number of proficiencies an NPC has, assume he requires 500 XP to advance to 1st level.\n\nEXAMPLE: A cataphract and a gongfarmer become henchmen and start adventuring. The cataphract has 11 proficiencies, so he needs just (16 – 11) x 60 = 300 XP to reach 1st level. The gongfarmer has just 4 proficiencies, so he needs (16 – 4) x 60 = 720 XP to reach 1st level. As a highly-trained military soldier, the cataphract requires much less time and experience to gain the skills needed.\n\nA 0th level character can earn experience points from adventurers or campaign activities.\n\n**Adventures:** A 0th level character who participates in an adventure will earn experience points as a henchman.\n\n**Magical Research:** A 0th level apprentice who studies under an arcane spellcaster of 9th level or higher can become 1st level mages. The apprentice must first undertake dedicated study. Assuming he starts with 4 proficiencies, he needs (12 x 60) = 720 XP to advance. If he studies at 6 days per week, with a research rate of 2.5gp per day, it will take 49 weeks, about a year). He then must make a research throw of 18+ (modified by INT). If the throw succeeds, the apprentice advances to 1st level. If the throw fails on an unmodified 1-3, the apprentice becomes discouraged by his inaptitude for magic and leaves the mage’s service. On any other result, the apprentice fails to advance in level and loses all of the accumulated campaign XP, but can continue his studies.\n\n**Domain and Mercantile Income:** A 0th level character can earn XP from domain and mercantile income. They are treated as if they had an XP Threshold of 25gp. The character will advance into a type of class appropriate to way the XP was earned. For instance, a petty noble’s son (0th level character) who inherits his father’s small domain (125gp per month) will earn 50 XP per month (125gp – 25gp), advancing to become a 1st level fighter after 5 months as serving as baron (if bandits don’t kill him first).\n\n**Hijinks:** A 0th level character can earn XP from perpetrating hijinks (usually carousing or racketeering). When the 0th level character earns 500xp from hijinks, he can become a 1st level assassin, nightblade, or thief. Which class will depend on his race (only elves may be nightblades) and the sort of company the character is keeping. On average, it takes 0th level characters several years of consorting with unsavory sorts in dimly-lit taverns to advance to become a “real” thief.\n\nWhen a 0th level character advances to 1st level, he gains the Adventuring proficiency and the attack throws, saving throws, class powers, and proficiencies of his new class. The character re-rolls his hit points using his new class’s Hit Die, keeping either his new hp total or his prior hp total +1 if it was higher.\n\nThe new 1st level character retains any proficiencies he already knew. If these proficiencies are equivalent to any of the class powers of his new class, they are replaced by the newly-gained class powers. If the proficiencies are not part of his class powers, they count against his limit of proficiencies from level, INT and/or time and training (p. XX). If he has more general proficiencies than permitted by level, INT, and time and training, he loses one proficiency each month of game time, representing the erosion of his old professional skills over time. If he has more class proficiencies than permitted, or class proficiencies not permitted to his class at all, he loses them when he advances to 1st level.\n"
