Large armies with multiple brigades, however, require such long columns of march that they occupy additional hexes on the regional map, and move much slower. The Movement of Large Armies table shows the column length and movement multiplier based on the size of the army.</p>\n<p>Regardless of size, an army begins and ends its weekly or daily march in one hex. The column length is the length during the march. The speed multiplier due to army size is applied on top of the speed multiplier for terrain. If a multi-hex army occupies two or more different types of terrain, apply the speed multiplier of the terrain the leading element of the army has just entered.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: Audarius Tarkaun is commanding an army of 32 infantry brigades and 8 heavy cavalry brigades (40 brigades total). The strategic turns are one week long and his army has a movement rate of 48 miles per week. It is traveling on a road, so speed is increased to 72 miles per week. However, the size of the army reduces that to 24 miles per week. As it moves, his army column extends a length of 12 miles (2 hexes).</p>\n<p>If an army’s column length in miles exceeds its modified speed in miles, then the army’s column length is reduced to its speed. This represents such slow movement that the vanguard of the army is forced to halt and start pitching camp before the rearguard has even left the prior day’s camp.</p>\n<p>When Tarkaun’s army nears the enemy, gameplay switches to daily turns. His army’s movement rate is 12 miles per day, modified to 18 miles per day by the road, and further modified to 6 miles per day by the army size. The army’s column length is only 6 miles.</p>\n<p>Because large armies move so slowly, it can sometimes be advantageous to split the army into divisions and have each division march separately. Each of the divisions then functions a separate army for all purposes until the armies regroup by moving back into the same hex.</p>\n<h3>Movement of War Machines</h3>\n<p><strong>War machines</strong>, which include all types of artillery, battering rams, galleries, hoists, screws, and siege towers, can be moved either assembled or disassembled. Assembled war machines move at a speed of 30’ per turn (6 miles per day and 24 miles per week), while disassembled war machines move at a speed of 60’ per turn (12 miles per day and 48 miles per week).</p>\n<p>Assembling and disassembling a war machine is a <strong>construction project</strong> (p. XX) with a construction cost equal to 1/100 the cost of constructing the war machine from scratch (minimum one day). Disassembled war machines cannot be used until they are assembled, so an army that has to suddenly pitch battle, or is surprised on the march, will not have access to any disassembled artillery and other devices.</p>\n<h3>Effects of Weather Conditions</h3>\n<p>The effects of weather conditions on armies are noted below. All effects are cumulative. For example, if both Cold and Snowy conditions are indicated, movement will be reduced to 25% normal (50% x 50%) while disease will have a 20% chance of occurring.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Effects of Severe Weather</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><em>Temperature</em></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Frigid</td>\n<td>The army’s expedition speed is halved.

The movement rates shown on the table above are figured based on a full day of travel through open, clear terrain. Terrain type (p. XX) and weather (p. XX) will modify speed.\n\n### Rest and Recuperation\n\nWhen moving over long distances, armies are required to rest for three days out of every seven in order to re-supply and care for their pack animals. The weekly speed on the adjoining table takes into account this mandatory rest period.\n\nIf an army marches more than four days out of seven without resting, all its units become **fatigued** until they have caught up on the required rest.\n\n**Tireless Troops:** Certain troops, such as constructs, have no need to rest. Such units can march every day, and even conduct a forced marching without penalty if desired (see below).\n\n### Forced Marching\n\nWhen necessary, armies can engage in a forced march. A leader may order a forced march either before initiative is rolled or during his initiative. If the leader orders a forced march before initiative is rolled, he gets a +2 bonus to his initiative score. This represents awakening the troops early for a pre-dawn start. A leader who orders a forced march during his initiative does not get this bonus. Either way, the army’s daily movement rate is increased by 50% because of the forced march.\n\nThe army must rest for one day after force marching or it becomes **fatigued**. This penalty applies even if the army does not actually move more than its normal daily movement.\n\n### Movement of Large Armies\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Movement of Large Armies** | | |\n| **Army Size** | **Column**  **Length** | **Speed**  **Multiplier** |\n| Less than 16 brigades | 3 miles (1 hex) | x1 |\n| 16 – 26 brigades | 6 miles (1 hexes) | X2/3 |\n| 27 – 32 brigades | 9 miles (1.5 hexes) | x1/2 |\n| 33 brigades or more | 12 miles (2 hexes) | x1/3 |\n\nMost armies occupy one 6-mile hex or less, and can march at about the same pace as individual men and horses. Large armies with multiple brigades, however, require such long columns of march that they occupy additional hexes on the regional map, and move much slower. The Movement of Large Armies table shows the column length and movement multiplier based on the size of the army.\n\nRegardless of size, an army begins and ends its weekly or daily march in one hex. The column length is the length during the march. The speed multiplier due to army size is applied on top of the speed multiplier for terrain. If a multi-hex army occupies two or more different types of terrain, apply the speed multiplier of the terrain the leading element of the army has just entered.\n\nEXAMPLE: Audarius Tarkaun is commanding an army of 32 infantry brigades and 8 heavy cavalry brigades (40 brigades total). The strategic turns are one week long and his army has a movement rate of 48 miles per week. It is traveling on a road, so speed is increased to 72 miles per week. However, the size of the army reduces that to 24 miles per week. As it moves, his army column extends a length of 12 miles (2 hexes).\n\nIf an army’s column length in miles exceeds its modified speed in miles, then the army’s column length is reduced to its speed. This represents such slow movement that the vanguard of the army is forced to halt and start pitching camp before the rearguard has even left the prior day’s camp.\n\nWhen Tarkaun’s army nears the enemy, gameplay switches to daily turns. His army’s movement rate is 12 miles per day, modified to 18 miles per day by the road, and further modified to 6 miles per day by the army size. The army’s column length is only 6 miles.\n\nBecause large armies move so slowly, it can sometimes be advantageous to split the army into divisions and have each division march separately. Each of the divisions then functions a separate army for all purposes until the armies regroup by moving back into the same hex.\n\n### Movement of War Machines\n\n**War machines**, which include all types of artillery, battering rams, galleries, hoists, screws, and siege towers, can be moved either assembled or disassembled. Assembled war machines move at a speed of 30’ per turn (6 miles per day and 24 miles per week), while disassembled war machines move at a speed of 60’ per turn (12 miles per day and 48 miles per week).\n\nAssembling and disassembling a war machine is a **construction project** (p.

For example, if both Cold and Snowy conditions are indicated, movement will be reduced to 25% normal (50% x 50%) while disease will have a 20% chance of occurring.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Effects of Severe Weather | |\n| *Temperature* | |\n| Frigid | The army’s expedition speed is halved.
