He also has 4 light catapults and 2 light trebuchets. These count as [(4 x 1) + (2 x 8)] 20 bonus units, giving Marcus a total of 70 units. Moruvai’s army has 12 units. Moruvai also has 4 medium catapults, which count as (4 x 2) 8 bonus units. Moruvai has a total of 20 units. Marcus’s unit advantage is (70 - 20) 50 units. Cross referencing Marcus’ unit advantage of 50 with the stronghold’s 24,000 shp, the Judge sees that it will take 18 days for Marcus to capture Moruvai’s stronghold.\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Duration of Siege** | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| **Stronghold’s**  **Structural HP** | **Besieging Army’s Unit Advantage** | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| **1 – 2** | **3 – 4** | **5 – 10** | **11 – 15** | **16 – 30** | **31 – 50** | **51 – 75** | **76 – 100** | **101 – 200** | **201 – 300** | **301 – 400** | **401 – 500** | **501 – 600** | **601+** |\n| 1 – 3,000 | 45 | 23 | 9 | 6 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| 4 – 6,000 | 90 | 45 | 18 | 12 | 6 | 4 | 2 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| 7 – 9,000 | 135 | 68 | 27 | 18 | 9 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n| 10 – 12,000 | 180 | 90 | 36 | 24 | 12 | 7 | 5 | 4 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |\n| 13 – 15,000 | 225 | 113 | 45 | 30 | 15 | 9 | 6 | 5 | 2 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |\n| 16 – 20,000 | - | 150 | 60 | 40 | 20 | 12 | 8 | 6 | 3 | 2 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 1 |\n| 21 – 30,000 | - | 225 | 90 | 60 | 30 | 18 | 12 | 9 | 5 | 3 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 1 |\n| 31 – 50,000 | - | - | 150 | 100 | 50 | 30 | 20 | 15 | 8 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 2 |\n| 51 – 75,000 | - | - | 225 | 150 | 75 | 45 | 30 | 23 | 11 | 8 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 |\n| 76 – 100,000 | - | - | - | 200 | 100 | 60 | 40 | 30 | 15 | 10 | 8 | 6 | 5 | 4 |\n| 101 – 125,000 | - | - | - | 250 | 125 | 75 | 50 | 38 | 19 | 13 | 9 | 8 | 6 | 5 |\n| 126 – 150,000 | - | - | - | - | 200 | 120 | 80 | 60 | 30 | 20 | 15 | 12 | 10 | 9 |\n| 151 – 200,000 | - | - | - | - | 250 | 150 | 100 | 75 | 38 | 25 | 19 | 15 | 13 | 11 |\n| 201 – 250,000 | - | - | - | - | - | 180 | 120 | 90 | 45 | 30 | 23 | 18 | 15 | 13 |\n| 251 – 300,000 | - | - | - | - | - | 210 | 140 | 105 | 53 | 35 | 26 | 21 | 18 | 15 |\n| 301,000+ | - | - | - | - | - | 240 | 160 | 120 | 60 | 40 | 30 | 24 | 20 | 17 |\n\nA stronghold situated on a mountain, island, or similar piece of inaccessible terrain is harder to capture than its structural hit points would indicate.

This represents, e.g., the defending army sallying forth when all hope is lost, the besieging army mopping up after the stronghold is reduced, and so on. Play the final battle as normal, with two exceptions related to morale collapse. Defending units which suffer a Flee result are assumed to be cowering in the rubble rather than actually putting any distance between themselves and the encircling attackers. Defenders which suffer a Rout result are considered to have surrendered to the besieging army, whose commander may determine the unit’s fate.\n\nThis table is especially useful for resolve sieges that are happening “off camera,” away from the activities of player characters. Should the PCs intervene in the siege, the Judge can calculate the state of the defending stronghold’s walls and supplies at the point when the PCs arrive. The stronghold will be reduced to 0 shp when the listed number of days has occurred, reduced to 50% of its shp when half the time has elapsed, and so on.\n\n**Designer’s Note**: The unit bonus afforded by artillery in sieges is not intended to match up 1:1 with the Battle Rating provided by artillery used in assaults. Ballista are more accurate against enemy units that catapults and trebuchets, but catapults and trebuchets are more effective against structures. There’s mathematical magic behind the scenes that yields these numbers.\n"
