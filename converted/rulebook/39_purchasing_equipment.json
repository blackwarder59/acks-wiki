A market can be anything from a village’s humble fair to a city-state’s outdoor bazaar to the ports of a major metropolis. Markets are rated by <strong>market class</strong> from I to VI, which rate their size and importance. The vast mercantile hubs of empires, with urban populations of 100,000 or more, constitute Class I. Major ports, national capitals, and other large cities of 25,000 or more inhabitants constitute Class II. Provincial capitals and medium-sized cities of 8,750 to 25,000 inhabitants make up Class III. Small cities and large towns of 3,000 to 8,750 inhabitants make up Class IV. Small towns and large villages of 1,250 to 3,000 inhabitants are Class V. A village of 1,250 inhabitants or less is Class VI. Market classes are also important for hiring henchmen, as discussed in the <strong>Hirelings</strong>, <strong>Henchmen</strong>, <strong>Mercenaries</strong>, <strong>and Specialists</strong> section below, and for trade and commerce, asdiscussed in the <strong>Mercantile Ventures</strong> section in the <strong>Campaigns</strong> chapter.</p>\n<p>The <strong>Equipment Availability by Market Class</strong> table shows how many units of any piece of equipment are available in each type of market each month. Some values will indicate a percentage chance; this is chance of one unit being present at all in any given month. The values given are the number of each specific item, not the total number of items at that price level. For instance, a Class IV market will have 10 swords, 10 battle axes, and 10 of each other item priced at 2-10gp. Multiple small items sold as a bundle (such as 6 spikes, 6 torches, 20 arrows, etc) count as one item for purposes of the Equipment Availability by Market Class table. The values are per party, representing those merchants who they know and transact with. Very large parties (12 or more adventurers) who devote a dedicated activity to shopping can purchase twice as much. (If the campaign involves multiple parties of adventurers, the maximum monthly number of items available across all parties is ten times the value shown.)</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Equipment Availability by Market Class</strong></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Price</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Class I</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Class II</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Class III</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Class IV</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Class V</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Class VI</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1gp or less</td>\n<td>2,750</td>\n<td>700</td>\n<td>425</td>\n<td>100</td>\n<td>35</td>\n<td>15</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2gp – 10gp</td>\n<td>300</td>\n<td>70</td>\n<td>35</td>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11 – 100gp</td>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>25%</td>\n<td>10%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>101 – 1,000gp</td>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>25%</td>\n<td>10%</td>\n<td>5%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1,001 – 10,000gp</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>25%</td>\n<td>10%</td>\n<td>5%</td>\n<td>1%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10,001gp or more</td>\n<td>25%</td>\n<td>10%</td>\n<td>3%</td>\n<td>1%</td>\n<td>NA</td>\n<td>NA</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>EXAMPLE: Marcus is in Cyfaraun, a Class III market. He wants to buy a war galley (60,000gp), medium warhorse (250gp), 2 suits of plate armor (60gp each), 50 swords (10gp each), and 200 flasks of common oil (3sp each). A Class III market has 425 units of any equipment priced 1gp or less, so he can buy the 200 flasks of oil. A Class III market has only 35 units of equipment priced 10gp or less, so only 35 swords are available. Since he needs weapons, he settles on 35 swords and 15 battle axes. A Class III market has 2 units of equipment priced at 11 – 100gp and 1 unit at 101 – 1,000gp, so he can buy the 2 suits of plate armor and medium warhorse. There is only a 3% chance of a war galley being available, and the Judge rolls a 42; Marcus cannot find that type of ship in Cyfaraun this month.</p>\n<p>Adventurers can sell equipment in good condition in the market subject to the same limits of market availability that apply to purchase.

The advantage of importing equipment is that more equipment is available. The number of items that can be imported is determined by the size of the market from which the items will be imported. The disadvantage of importing equipment is that it is not immediately available. Imports arrive from a local hub after 2d6 days and from a regional hub after 2d6 weeks.
