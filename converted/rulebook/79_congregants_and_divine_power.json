  "html": "<h2>Congregants and Divine Power</h2>\n<p>Divine spellcasters such as crusaders, bladedancers, and craftpriests, can draw on the <strong>divine power</strong> of their deity to aid them. Divine power is measured in <strong>gp value equivalent</strong> and has a number of uses.</p>\n<h3>Congregations</h3>\n<p>Lawful divine spellcasters earn divine power drawn by building congregations of faithful worshippers. Every fifty congregants earns the caster 10gp worth of divine power per week of faithful worship.</p>\n<p>To qualify as congregants, characters must be of the same alignment as the divine spellcaster, worship his deity, and consider the divine spellcaster to be their spiritual advisor. A divine spellcaster’s party members, henchmen and followers can (and should) form the core of his congregants.</p>\n<p>Divine spellcasters can recruit congregants by performing charitable deeds, sending out missionaries, and constructing temples. Each month, calculate the value of the spellcaster’s proselytizing:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The gp value of all spells charitably cast on behalf of peasants by the spellcaster or his henchmen or followers (using the costs for spells from the Spell Availability by Markettable in the <strong>Hirelings</strong>, <strong>Henchmen</strong>, <strong>Mercenaries</strong>, <strong>and Specialists</strong> section);</li>\n<li>The gp value of any hirelings deployed as missionaries in the realm by the spellcaster; and</li>\n<li>The gp value of any religious structures erected in the realm by the spellcaster that month.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For every full 1,000gp value of proselytizing in the month, the divine spellcaster gains a number of congregants equal to 1d10 + CHA bonus. The divine spellcaster cannot acquire more congregants than exist in the realm that he is proselytizing within.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: Balbus, a 4th level crusader, seeks congregants in the village he and his party are based in. He erects a wooden chapel to Ammonar costing 700gp, and spends a week casting spells for the peasants. As a 4th level crusader, he can cast 2 1st level spells (each worth 5gp) and 2 2nd level spells (worth 20gp) each day. Over the course of a week, Balbus casts 350gp worth of spells for the peasants. The gp value of his proselytizing is 1,050gp, so he gains a number of congregants equal to a roll of 1d10 + CHA bonus.</p>\n<p>Once acquired, the divine caster must maintain the congregation or they will begin to lose faith. Maintaining a congregation requires one day of dedicated activity each week. If the caster does not undertake this dedicated activity, the divine spellcaster loses 1d10! congregants per 1,000. This represents counter-missionary work, abandonment of faith, or other spiritual challenges.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Domain Worship</strong></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Domain</strong>  <strong>Morale</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Divine Power</strong>  <strong>per 10 Families</strong>  <strong>per Week</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>-4</td>\n<td>0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>-3</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>-2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>-1</td>\n<td>3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>+1</td>\n<td>5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td>6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td>7</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>+4</td>\n<td>8</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>More powerful divine spellcasters can amass congregants by assuming rulership of a domain, or becoming the chaplain of a domain ruler. A ruler can simply command his subjects to worship his god, creating vast multitudes of worshippers within his domain. Of course, not every subject in a domain will faithfully worship on command — the domain’s morale will make a large difference. The Domain Worship table lists the value of spiritual essence a ruler or his chaplain can extract from the peasant families in his domain. This amount is always less than the full 10gp per fifty congregants, as no domain will be 100% faithful to the character’s god.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: Balbus, now a 9th level Crusader, rules Ammantavus, a domain of 2,500 peasant families (12,500 people) with a domain morale score of 0. Each week, Balbus gains 4gp worth of spiritual essence per 10 families (50 people), or 1,000gp value total, from his domain. If Balbus’s subjects were more loyal to him, he could gain much more spiritual essence from his domain.</p>\n<p>A ruler who asks his subjects to worship a god or religion foreign to them will suffer large penalties to domain morale. Rulers will often address this by throwing festivals in the new faith or taking other steps to increase domain morale.</p>\n<p>Sometimes a divine spellcaster might have congregants from proselytization that are also residents in the domain he presides over; For instance, he might have been proselytizing in a domain, and then become ruler or chaplain of that domain. In that case, the caster gets 10gp per 10 families (50 congregants) in his personal congregation, and then a variable gp per family from the remaining families based on the domain morale.</p>\n<h3>Blood Sacrifice</h3>\n<p>While chaotic divine spellcasters can earn divine power from gaining congregants, a darker path is also available to them: Blood sacrifice of living creatures to their deity.</p>\n<p>Conducting a blood sacrifice must be performed in a chaotic temple, graveyard, or other sinkhole of evil. The sacrificial victim(s) must be <strong>helpless</strong> (if Lawful or Neutral) orwilling (if Chaotic). Sacrificing unwilling chaotic creatures provides no divine power, as the dark gods see little merit in the slaughter of their own worshippers. The sacrifice of a willing chaotic creature does earn divine power, however, as it offers a means for chaotic spellcasters to demonstrate their power and faith.</p>\n<p>Each blood sacrifice takes one turn. At the completion of the sacrifice, the spellcaster earns divine power equal to the value of the creature’s components. Usually this value is equal to its XP value, but not always. For instance, most ordinary animals provide no divine power and some great-souled creatures provide ten times as much! See <em><strong>ACKS II Monstrous Manual</strong></em>for details.</p>\n<p>After receiving this divine power, the spellcaster then makes a magic research throw. If the throw fails, there is no further effect. If it succeeds, the spellcaster gains additional divine power, as a reward from his dark gods. The additional power gained is based on the characteristics of the victim:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Victim Characteristic</td>\n<td>Multiplier</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Victim is virgin</td>\n<td>+ Component Value</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Victim is divine caster of opposite alignment/faith</td>\n<td>+ Component Value x 2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Victim is noble (ruler or heir of barony to duchy)</td>\n<td>+ Component Value x 3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Victim is royal (ruler or heir of principality, kingdom, or empire)</td>\n<td>+ Component Value x 5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Victim is parent, mature descendant, or beloved of sacrificier</td>\n<td>+ Component Value x 10</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>EXAMPLE: Mentu the Death Priest, a 12th level chaotic crusader, is sacrificing Balbus to his patron deity, Dirgion the Doombringer. Balbus is a 14th level crusader worth 2,700 XP. Balbus is also the ruler of a principality and is a crusader of Dirgion’s hated rival, Ammonar. Therefore, If Mentu succeeds on his magical research throw of 5+, he will earn divine power totaling (2,700) + (2,700 x 2) + (2,700 x 5) = 21,600.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, Mentu rolls a 2. He gains a mere 2,700 divine power as the crusader’s spirit escapes to a holier place. In a rage, Mentu sacrifices the ogres who had captured the crusader. As these are unwilling chaotic sacrifices, he gains no value from doing so (apart from sating his blood lust!).</p>\n<p><strong>Designer’s Note:</strong> In the Auran Empire setting, animal sacrifices to the Empyrean gods do not generate divine power for the spellcaster, because the divine power is sent to the deity in an act of devotion. In other campaign settings, however, Lawful or Neutral divine spellcasters might be permitted to conduct blood sacrifice of non-sapient animals such as bulls, horses, etc. Since ordinary animals do not provide any divine power, only exceptional specimens could be used in such sacrifices. Lawful or Neutral spellcasters can never benefit from the blood sacrifice of sapient creatures.</p>\n<h3>Using Divine Power</h3>\n<p>Divine power is granted to casters so that they can advance the agenda of the power they serve. It must be spent within one month of being received and cannot be stored. If not spent within one month of its accumulation, it fades away, the spiritual energies returning to the caster’s deity.</p>\n<h6>Consecrating Altar</h6>\n<p>A divine caster can use divine power to consecrate an altar. Consecrating an altar is an ongoing dedicated activity lasting one day per 500gp of altar value and requires an expenditure of divine power equal to the value of the altar. An altar consecrated to the Chaotic powers creates a sinkhole of evil, while an altar consecrated to the Lawful powers creates a pinnacle of good. The size of the sinkhole or pinnacle around the altar will be 100 square feet per 100gp spent on the altar. If a humbler-looking altar is desired, divine power can be spent in lieu of gp. Once consecrated, an altar retains its aura until the aura is <strong>dispelled</strong>or the altar is physically broken and <em>blessed</em>.</p>\n<h6>Consecrating Fields</h6>\n<p>A divine caster can use divine power to consecrate a domain’s fields. Consecrating fields is an ongoing dedicated activity requiring 1 day per 780 peasant families (rounded up). Upon completing the consecration, the spellcaster must expend 2gp of divine power per family and make a magic research throw. If the throw succeeds, the fields have been consecrated. Consecration increases the Land Value by 1gp during the next month’s Revenue Collection phase. If the throw is an unmodified 1, the consecration goes awry, and the Land Value is decreased by 1gp during the next month’s Revenue Collection phase. Fields may be consecrated repeatedly if sufficient divine power is available, and legends tell of garden-like realms blessed by the gods.</p>\n<h6>Consecrating Ruler</h6>\n<p>A divine caster of 9th level or higher who is the chaplain of a domain ruler can invest the ruler with sacred authority. Consecrating a ruler is a dedicated activity for one day, but it cannot be performed more than once per year. Upon completing the consecration, the spellcaster must expend divine power equal to the ruler’s monthly domain revenue, and make a magic research throw. If the throw succeeds, the ruler has been consecrated. For the next 12 game months, the consecrated ruler increases his domain’s base morale score by 1 point and gain a +1 bonus on all loyalty rolls by vassals. When generating random vagaries while the ruler is consecrated, the Judge will roll twice and select the vagary that is more favorable to the ruler (vagaries are detailed in the <em><strong>ACKS II Judges Journal</strong></em>). However, if the throw is an unmodified 1, the consecration goes awry. The ruler decreases his domain’s base morale score by 1 point, imposes a -1 penalty to all loyalty rolls by vassals, and suffers the worse of two vagary rolls. At the Judge’s discretion, the magic research throw can be modified by the ruler’s behavior in the past 12 months, and awry results might occur in an increased range (an unmodified 1 – 3) for exceptionally impious rulers.</p>\n<h6>Magic Research</h6>\n<p>A divine caster who is engaged in magic research can use divine powerto pay for some or all of the component cost and/or material cost of the research. The research must be in furtherance of the goals of the divine spellcaster’s patron deity. Some magic research projects might require special components that cannot be replaced by divine power (Judge’s discretion).</p>\n<h6>Praying and Sacrificing</h6>\n<p>A divine caster can return divine power to his god through prayer and sacrifice. Prayer and sacrifice requires one day of dedicated activity. The gp value of divine power returned to the deity each month grants campaign XP to the extent it exceeds the spellcaster’s GP threshold.</p>\n",

Divine power is measured in **gp value equivalent** and has a number of uses.\n\n### Congregations\n\nLawful divine spellcasters earn divine power drawn by building congregations of faithful worshippers. Every fifty congregants earns the caster 10gp worth of divine power per week of faithful worship.\n\nTo qualify as congregants, characters must be of the same alignment as the divine spellcaster, worship his deity, and consider the divine spellcaster to be their spiritual advisor. A divine spellcaster’s party members, henchmen and followers can (and should) form the core of his congregants.\n\nDivine spellcasters can recruit congregants by performing charitable deeds, sending out missionaries, and constructing temples. Each month, calculate the value of the spellcaster’s proselytizing:\n\n* The gp value of all spells charitably cast on behalf of peasants by the spellcaster or his henchmen or followers (using the costs for spells from the Spell Availability by Markettable in the **Hirelings**, **Henchmen**, **Mercenaries**, **and Specialists** section);\n* The gp value of any hirelings deployed as missionaries in the realm by the spellcaster; and\n* The gp value of any religious structures erected in the realm by the spellcaster that month.\n\nFor every full 1,000gp value of proselytizing in the month, the divine spellcaster gains a number of congregants equal to 1d10 + CHA bonus. The divine spellcaster cannot acquire more congregants than exist in the realm that he is proselytizing within.\n\nEXAMPLE: Balbus, a 4th level crusader, seeks congregants in the village he and his party are based in. He erects a wooden chapel to Ammonar costing 700gp, and spends a week casting spells for the peasants. As a 4th level crusader, he can cast 2 1st level spells (each worth 5gp) and 2 2nd level spells (worth 20gp) each day. Over the course of a week, Balbus casts 350gp worth of spells for the peasants. The gp value of his proselytizing is 1,050gp, so he gains a number of congregants equal to a roll of 1d10 + CHA bonus.\n\nOnce acquired, the divine caster must maintain the congregation or they will begin to lose faith. Maintaining a congregation requires one day of dedicated activity each week. If the caster does not undertake this dedicated activity, the divine spellcaster loses 1d10! congregants per 1,000. This represents counter-missionary work, abandonment of faith, or other spiritual challenges.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Domain Worship** | |\n| **Domain**  **Morale** | **Divine Power**  **per 10 Families**  **per Week** |\n| -4 | 0 |\n| -3 | 1 |\n| -2 | 2 |\n| -1 | 3 |\n| 0 | 4 |\n| +1 | 5 |\n| +2 | 6 |\n| +3 | 7 |\n| +4 | 8 |\n\nMore powerful divine spellcasters can amass congregants by assuming rulership of a domain, or becoming the chaplain of a domain ruler. A ruler can simply command his subjects to worship his god, creating vast multitudes of worshippers within his domain. Of course, not every subject in a domain will faithfully worship on command — the domain’s morale will make a large difference. The Domain Worship table lists the value of spiritual essence a ruler or his chaplain can extract from the peasant families in his domain. This amount is always less than the full 10gp per fifty congregants, as no domain will be 100% faithful to the character’s god.\n\nEXAMPLE: Balbus, now a 9th level Crusader, rules Ammantavus, a domain of 2,500 peasant families (12,500 people) with a domain morale score of 0. Each week, Balbus gains 4gp worth of spiritual essence per 10 families (50 people), or 1,000gp value total, from his domain. If Balbus’s subjects were more loyal to him, he could gain much more spiritual essence from his domain.\n\nA ruler who asks his subjects to worship a god or religion foreign to them will suffer large penalties to domain morale. Rulers will often address this by throwing festivals in the new faith or taking other steps to increase domain morale.\n\nSometimes a divine spellcaster might have congregants from proselytization that are also residents in the domain he presides over; For instance, he might have been proselytizing in a domain, and then become ruler or chaplain of that domain. In that case, the caster gets 10gp per 10 families (50 congregants) in his personal congregation, and then a variable gp per family from the remaining families based on the domain morale.\n\n### Blood Sacrifice\n\nWhile chaotic divine spellcasters can earn divine power from gaining congregants, a darker path is also available to them: Blood sacrifice of living creatures to their deity.\n\nConducting a blood sacrifice must be performed in a chaotic temple, graveyard, or other sinkhole of evil. The sacrificial victim(s) must be **helpless** (if Lawful or Neutral) orwilling (if Chaotic). Sacrificing unwilling chaotic creatures provides no divine power, as the dark gods see little merit in the slaughter of their own worshippers. The sacrifice of a willing chaotic creature does earn divine power, however, as it offers a means for chaotic spellcasters to demonstrate their power and faith.\n\nEach blood sacrifice takes one turn. At the completion of the sacrifice, the spellcaster earns divine power equal to the value of the creature’s components. Usually this value is equal to its XP value, but not always. For instance, most ordinary animals provide no divine power and some great-souled creatures provide ten times as much! See ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual***for details.\n\nAfter receiving this divine power, the spellcaster then makes a magic research throw. If the throw fails, there is no further effect. If it succeeds, the spellcaster gains additional divine power, as a reward from his dark gods. The additional power gained is based on the characteristics of the victim:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Victim Characteristic | Multiplier |\n| Victim is virgin | + Component Value |\n| Victim is divine caster of opposite alignment/faith | + Component Value x 2 |\n| Victim is noble (ruler or heir of barony to duchy) | + Component Value x 3 |\n| Victim is royal (ruler or heir of principality, kingdom, or empire) | + Component Value x 5 |\n| Victim is parent, mature descendant, or beloved of sacrificier | + Component Value x 10 |\n\nEXAMPLE: Mentu the Death Priest, a 12th level chaotic crusader, is sacrificing Balbus to his patron deity, Dirgion the Doombringer. Balbus is a 14th level crusader worth 2,700 XP. Balbus is also the ruler of a principality and is a crusader of Dirgion’s hated rival, Ammonar. Therefore, If Mentu succeeds on his magical research throw of 5+, he will earn divine power totaling (2,700) + (2,700 x 2) + (2,700 x 5) = 21,600.\n\nUnfortunately, Mentu rolls a 2. He gains a mere 2,700 divine power as the crusader’s spirit escapes to a holier place. In a rage, Mentu sacrifices the ogres who had captured the crusader. As these are unwilling chaotic sacrifices, he gains no value from doing so (apart from sating his blood lust!).\n\n**Designer’s Note:** In the Auran Empire setting, animal sacrifices to the Empyrean gods do not generate divine power for the spellcaster, because the divine power is sent to the deity in an act of devotion. In other campaign settings, however, Lawful or Neutral divine spellcasters might be permitted to conduct blood sacrifice of non-sapient animals such as bulls, horses, etc. Since ordinary animals do not provide any divine power, only exceptional specimens could be used in such sacrifices. Lawful or Neutral spellcasters can never benefit from the blood sacrifice of sapient creatures.\n\n### Using Divine Power\n\nDivine power is granted to casters so that they can advance the agenda of the power they serve. It must be spent within one month of being received and cannot be stored. If not spent within one month of its accumulation, it fades away, the spiritual energies returning to the caster’s deity.\n\n###### Consecrating Altar\n\nA divine caster can use divine power to consecrate an altar. Consecrating an altar is an ongoing dedicated activity lasting one day per 500gp of altar value and requires an expenditure of divine power equal to the value of the altar. An altar consecrated to the Chaotic powers creates a sinkhole of evil, while an altar consecrated to the Lawful powers creates a pinnacle of good. The size of the sinkhole or pinnacle around the altar will be 100 square feet per 100gp spent on the altar. If a humbler-looking altar is desired, divine power can be spent in lieu of gp. Once consecrated, an altar retains its aura until the aura is **dispelled**or the altar is physically broken and *blessed*.\n\n###### Consecrating Fields\n\nA divine caster can use divine power to consecrate a domain’s fields. Consecrating fields is an ongoing dedicated activity requiring 1 day per 780 peasant families (rounded up). Upon completing the consecration, the spellcaster must expend 2gp of divine power per family and make a magic research throw. If the throw succeeds, the fields have been consecrated. Consecration increases the Land Value by 1gp during the next month’s Revenue Collection phase. If the throw is an unmodified 1, the consecration goes awry, and the Land Value is decreased by 1gp during the next month’s Revenue Collection phase. Fields may be consecrated repeatedly if sufficient divine power is available, and legends tell of garden-like realms blessed by the gods.\n\n###### Consecrating Ruler\n\nA divine caster of 9th level or higher who is the chaplain of a domain ruler can invest the ruler with sacred authority. Consecrating a ruler is a dedicated activity for one day, but it cannot be performed more than once per year. Upon completing the consecration, the spellcaster must expend divine power equal to the ruler’s monthly domain revenue, and make a magic research throw. If the throw succeeds, the ruler has been consecrated. For the next 12 game months, the consecrated ruler increases his domain’s base morale score by 1 point and gain a +1 bonus on all loyalty rolls by vassals. When generating random vagaries while the ruler is consecrated, the Judge will roll twice and select the vagary that is more favorable to the ruler (vagaries are detailed in the ***ACKS II Judges Journal***). However, if the throw is an unmodified 1, the consecration goes awry. The ruler decreases his domain’s base morale score by 1 point, imposes a -1 penalty to all loyalty rolls by vassals, and suffers the worse of two vagary rolls. At the Judge’s discretion, the magic research throw can be modified by the ruler’s behavior in the past 12 months, and awry results might occur in an increased range (an unmodified 1 – 3) for exceptionally impious rulers.\n\n###### Magic Research\n\nA divine caster who is engaged in magic research can use divine powerto pay for some or all of the component cost and/or material cost of the research. The research must be in furtherance of the goals of the divine spellcaster’s patron deity. Some magic research projects might require special components that cannot be replaced by divine power (Judge’s discretion).\n\n###### Praying and Sacrificing\n\nA divine caster can return divine power to his god through prayer and sacrifice. Prayer and sacrifice requires one day of dedicated activity. The gp value of divine power returned to the deity each month grants campaign XP to the extent it exceeds the spellcaster’s GP threshold.\n"
