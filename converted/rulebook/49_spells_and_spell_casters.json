When a caster casts a spell, he taps into a source of magical power and then channels that power into a specific supernatural effect. The specific effect is controlled by a combination of hand gestures and spoken incantations that specify the desired result.

Other types of magic, such as <strong>eldritch</strong>, have been detailed in other <em><strong>ACKS</strong></em>sourcebooks. Arcane casters tap the ambient power that suffuses the cosmos. Divine casters tap the power of immortal deities or ancestral spirits whom they venerate. Both types of casters draw on their own personal power to channel the external power they receive.

The number of castings available to the caster refreshes each time the caster enjoys 8 hours of restful sleep. A caster cannot enjoy more than 8 hours of restful sleep in any 24-hour period.</p>\n<h6>Casting Requirements</h6>\n<p>All spellcasters need to be able to move their hands and speak in order to make the gestures and say the incantations that bring magic effects into being.
