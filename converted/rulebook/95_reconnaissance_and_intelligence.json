Since the means of intelligence gathering that might be employed, and the counter-measures against them, are as limitless as the imagination of players, <em><strong>ACKS II</strong></em>abstracts the various tactics into a set of mechanics called <strong>reconnaissance rolls</strong>.</p>\n<h3>Frequency of Reconnaissance rolls</h3>\n<p>At the start of each week (or day, if in close proximity), the Judge will make an initial reconnaissance rollfor each army to determine what intelligence it has gathered on each nearby opposing army from regular scouting, spies, and so on. The maximum range at which armies can be reconnoitered is determined by its size, as shown on the adjacent Reconnaissance Range table. The “observing army” is the army making the reconnaissance roll, while the “opposing army” is the army being observed.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Reconnaissance Range</strong></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Opposing Army Size</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Observing Army Must Be Within</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>120 troops or less</td>\n<td>One 24-mile hex</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>121 – 600 troops</td>\n<td>Two 24-mile hexes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>601 – 3000 troops</td>\n<td>Three 24-mile hexes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3,001 troops or more</td>\n<td>Four 24-mile hexes</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>There is no particular limit to the number of reconnaissance rolls an army will make during initial reconnaissance — if there are three armies within range, it will make three reconnaissance rolls. If there is only one army within range, it will make only one reconnaissance roll.</p>\n<p>Anytime there are multiple friendly armies within one 24-mile hex, all armies in that hex are treated as a single army for purposes of initial reconnaissance rolls. For example, if there are 10 watchtowers with 1 unit of cavalry each spread across a 24-mile hex, the Judge will roll for and against them as a single army with 10 units of cavalry.</p>\n<p>If, during the course of an acting army’s movement, it enters the same 6 mile hex as an opposing army, both the acting army and opposing army make an additional reconnaissance roll. Multiple opposing armies within one 6-mile hex are always treated as a single army.</p>\n<p>Reconnaissance rolls should alwaysbe made by the Judge, so that the army leaders remain unaware of how many rolls were made, and how many they failed.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Reconnaissance Rolls</strong></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Modified Die Roll</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Result</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2-</td>\n<td>Catastrophe</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3 – 5</td>\n<td>Failure</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6 – 8</td>\n<td>Marginal Success</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9 – 11</td>\n<td>Success</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12+</td>\n<td>Major Success</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h3>Reconnaissance Roll Procedure</h3>\n<p>To make a reconnaissance roll, the Judge rolls 2d6 and consults the Reconnaissance Rolls table.

If the opposing army is dispersed into two or more hexes, determine the proximity by counting the number of hexes between the observing army and the largest division (or other body of troops) in the opposing army. If both the observing and opposing armies are dispersed into multiple hexes, determine the proximity by counting the number of hexes between the closest unit of the observing army and the largest division in the opposing army.</p>\n<p><strong>Magic — Observation:</strong> Magic can only be used for observation during initial reconnaissance rolls, as the army commander won’t know that additional rolls are occurring as his army moves. Using magic grants a +1 bonus for each of the following spells: <em>greater clairaudiency</em>, <em>greater clairvoyancy</em>, <em>lay of the land</em>, <em>locate distance object</em>, <em>scry.</em> In addition, the following rules apply:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Lay of the Land</em> always reveals the presence of an enemy army or supply base if within the same 6-mile hex.</li>\n<li><em>Locate distant object</em> always reveals the distance and direction to the designated object (usually an enemy battle standard).</li>\n<li><em>Greater clairaudiency</em>, <em>greater clairvoyance</em>, and <em>scry</em> allow the observing army to designate a 6-mile hex upon which the magic is used. The observing army then uses either that hex or its actual hex for purposes of proximity, whichever is better. However, if the observing army designates a 6-mile hex outside of its own reconaissance range, it cannot capture prisoners from the reconnaissance roll.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The spellcaster must be able to meet the requirements of the spell in order to use it. For example, to use <em>scrying,</em> the caster must be familiar with someone in the opposing army, or already know the location of the opposing army. If an officer is protected by an <strong>amulet of indiscernibility</strong> or the spell of the same name, his location and the location of units under his direct command cannot be scried upon. This does not prevent other officers or units from the army being scried on. Only if everyofficer in the army is protected by an <strong>amulet</strong> or <em>indiscernibility</em>is their army protected from scrying.</p>\n<p>Other spells, such as <em>communion</em>or<em>contact<strong>other</strong>sphere</em>,do not modify the reconnaissance roll. However, the Judge should still provide information from these spells using the mechanics described in their spell entry.</p>\n<p><strong>Magic — Camouflage:</strong> Magical camouflage reduces the effective size of the opposing army, which makes the army harder to observe. Each <em>illusory**terrain</em>, <em>hidden**host</em>,or <em>permanent**figment</em> spell can hide one company-sized unit. For example, if an army with seven units employs<em>hidden**host</em> to disguise two units, it will count as being an army of five units (600 troops) total for purposes of army size. Even if the reconnaissance roll succeeds, the units hidden by magic will not revealed by the roll. However, interrogation of prisoners might still reveal the existence of these troops.</p>\n<p><strong>Scouting and Screening Troops:</strong> Scouting and screening troops only modify reconnaissance rolls within a limited range around them. Cavalry and flyers on garrison duty will scout and screen within the territory of the domain they garrison. Cavalry and flyers in an army on campaign will only scout and screen the 24-mile hex their army is located in and the adjacent 24-mile hexes. Reconnaissance rolls between armies two or more 24-mile hexes away will therefore not be modified. The table assumes company-sized units; treat 4 platoon-sized units as 1 unit, a battalion-sized unit as 4 units, and a brigade-scale unit as 16 units.</p>\n<p><strong>Spies:</strong> Spies can be infiltrated into an opposing army using the rules in for Hijinks (p. XX).</p>\n<p><strong>Stratagems:</strong> This represents a variable modifier that the Judge can assign based on the actions of PCs and major NPCs. See the <strong>Stratagems</strong> section below.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: A goblin army (4,320 troops) has just moved into a 24-mile hex of woods occupied by an elven army (1,200 troops). Both armies now get the chance to locate each other. The leader of the elves has a strategic ability of +2, while the leader of the goblins has a strategic ability of -1. The elves have 1 unit of giant hawks (flyers) and 2 units of horse archers (cavalry); the goblins have 16 units of wolf riders (cavalry). The elves are more familiar with the region.</p>\n<p>The elven army will make a reconnaissance roll with the following modifiers: -1 (opposing army has 6 to 20 cavalry units), -1 (opposing army has overall more cavalry and flyers units), +1 (superior ranks in military strategy), +1 (more familiar with region), +2 (can observe enemy from the air), -1 (opposing army in woods). The total bonuses and penalties add up to +1, so the Judge will roll 2d6+1 for the elves. The Judge rolls an 8, modified to 9. The elves have rolled a success!</p>\n<p>The goblin army will make a reconnaissance roll with the following modifiers: +1 (6 to 20 cavalry units), +1 (army has overall more cavalry and flyers), -1 (inferior ranks in military strategy), -1 (less familiar with region), -1 (opposing army in woods), -1 (opposing army has only 5 to 20 units). The total adds up to -2, so the Judge will roll 2d6-2 for the goblins.</p>\n<p>The Judge rolls a 5, modified to a 3; the goblins have failed to gather any information about the elves. In fact, they probably aren’t even aware there is an elven army in the area (unless they knew from a prior reconnaissance roll success).</p>\n<h3>Results of Reconnaissance Rolls</h3>\n<p>A <strong>catastrophe</strong> means that the observing army has gathered false intelligence. The Judge should inform the observing army’s leader that he has rolled a marginal success and pretend to provide intelligence as if that were the case. However, the intelligence will be riddled with falsehoods and misinformation.</p>\n<p>A <strong>failure</strong> simply means the observing army has gathered no intelligence. If the opposing army has not yet been detected, then the observing army may be unaware that the observing army is there at all.</p>\n<p>A <strong>marginal success, success</strong>, or <strong>major success</strong> means the observing army has gathered some intelligence. The amount of intelligence gathered will depend on the degree of success and the proximity of the two armies, as shown on the <strong>Results of Reconnaissance</strong> table below.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Results of Reconnaissance Rolls</strong></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Degree of Success</strong></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Proximity of Armies</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Marginal Success</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Success</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Major Success</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Same 6-mile Hex</td>\n<td>Location (6-mile hex)  Approximate size  Direction of march  Number of divisions  Number of units per division  Common prisoner</td>\n<td>Location (6-mile hex)  Approximate size  Direction of march  Number of divisions  Number of units per division  Type of each unit  Valuable prisoner</td>\n<td>Location (6-mile hex)  Approximate size  Direction of march  Number of divisions  Number of units per division  Type of each unit  Strength of each unit  Very valuable prisoner</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Same 24-mile Hex</td>\n<td>Location (24-mile hex)  Approximate size  Direction of march  Number of divisions</td>\n<td>Location (6-mile hex)  Approximate size  Direction of march  Number of divisions  Number of units per division  Common prisoner</td>\n<td>Location (6-mile hex)  Approximate size  Direction of march  Number of divisions  Number of units per division  Type of each unit  Valuable prisoner</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1 – 2 24-mile Hexes</td>\n<td>Location (within 2 24-mile hexes)  Approximate size  Direction of march</td>\n<td>Location (24-mile hex)  Approximate size  Direction of march  Number of divisions</td>\n<td>Location (6-mile hex)  Approximate size  Direction of march  Number of divisions  Number of units per division  Common prisoner</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3 – 4 24-mile Hexes</td>\n<td>Location (within 4 24-mile hexes)  Approximate size</td>\n<td>Location (within 2 24-mile hexes)  Approximate size  Direction of march</td>\n<td>Location (24-mile hex)  Approximate size  Direction of march  Number of divisions</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Location:</strong> The observing army learns the location of the opposing army relative to its own position. The precision with which the location is known can range from a wide swath of hexes to a specific 6-mile hex.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: The modified result of the elven army’s reconnaissance roll was a 9, so the elven army had a success. The elven army is in the same 24-mile hex as the goblin army. Cross-indexing “same 24-mile hex” with “success” on the Results of the Reconnaissance Rolls table, the Judge notes that the elven army learns which 6-mile hex the goblin army occupies. He provides this information to the leader of the elven army.</p>\n<p><strong>Approximate Size:</strong> The observing army learns whether the opposing army is small (600 or fewer troops); average (600 to 3,000 troops); large (3,001 to 12,000 troops); huge (12,001 to 36,000 troops); gigantic (36,001 to 72,000 troops); or colossal (72,001 or more troops).</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: The Judge reveals that the goblin army is large (3,001 to 12,000 troops).</p>\n<p><strong>Direction of March:</strong> The observing army learns the opposing army’s direction of march in the preceding week. In most cases, this is a compass direction on the hex map. However, if the opposing army remained stationary last week, the observing army learns that instead. If the opposing army had been following a particular road, the observing army learns which road.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: The Judge reveals that the goblin army is marching southwest.</p>\n<p><strong>Number of Divisions</strong>: The observing army learns the number of divisions in the opposing army. This can be valuable intelligence as it hints at the leadership ability of the enemy general, the number of officers available to the opposing army, and the flexibility of its command.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: The Judge reveals that the goblin army is divided into four divisions.</p>\n<p><strong>Number of Units per Division:</strong> The observing army learns the number of units in each division of the opposing army. This can help identify if some divisions have particularly able commanders, or are particularly strong or weak. The observing army also learns whether the opposing army is organized into company-sized, battalion-sized or brigade-sized units.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: The Judge reveals that the goblin army’s first division has two battalion-sized units; its second division has three battalion-sized units; its third division has three battalion-sized units; and its fourth division has two battalion-sized units.</p>\n<p><strong>Type of Each Unit:</strong> The observing army learns the type of each unit it has detected, such as heavy infantry, light cavalry, war elephants, and so on. An army of cavalry and heavy infantry is obviously far more threatening than an army of conscripted peasants.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: Since the elven army only rolled a success, it does not learn the type of each unit. Had the elven army rolled a major success, the Judge would have revealed that the goblin army’s first division consisted of two battalion-sized goblin wolf rider units; its second division has four battalion-sized goblin light infantry units; its third division has three battalion-sized goblin slinger units; and its fourth division has two battalion-sized goblin wolf rider units.</p>\n<p><strong>Strength of Each Unit:</strong> The observing army learns the troop strength of each unit it has detected. This intelligence can be critically valuable as an army might turn out to consist of understrength units.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: Since the elven army only rolled a success and was not in the same 6-mile hex as the goblin army, it does not learn the strength of each unit. Had the elven army rolled a major success while sharing the same 6-mile hex as the goblin army, the Judge would have revealed that the goblin army’s first division consisted of two goblin wolf rider units of 240 troops each; its second division has four goblin light infantry units of 480 troops each; its third division has three goblin slinger units of 480 troops each; and its fourth division has two goblin wolf rider units of 240 troops each.</p>\n<p><strong>Prisoners:</strong> In some cases, a reconnaissance roll can yield <strong>prisoners</strong>! Prisoners might to be captured deserters, foragers, scouts, or even turncoats. Each prisoner will know 1d3 pieces of information. For each piece of information, roll 1d8 and cross-index the result with the appropriate column on the Prisoner Information table. If the same piece of information is rolled twice, then the information known to the prisoner is of a more detailed nature (shift one column right on the table). The Judge should make these rolls in secret and then decide the identity of the prisoner accordingly.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: The elven army rolled a success on its reconnaissance roll against the goblin army in its 24-mile hex. According to the Results of Reconnaissance table, the elven army has captured a common prisoner. The Judge secretly rolls 1d3 and scores a 2, so the prisoner will know two pieces of information. He rolls 1d4 for the first piece of information and scores a 1. Cross-indexing a roll of 1 with the “Common Prisoner” column, the Judge finds that the prisoner knows the name, race, and class of the goblin army’s leader. The Judge then rolls 1d4 for the second piece of information and scores another 1. This means the prisoner knows even more on the same topic. The Judge therefore cross-indexes a roll of 1 with the “Valuable Prisoner” column, and finds that the prisoner knows the name, class, approximate level, and description of the goblin army’s leader, and its total number of officers. The Judge decides the prisoner is a goblin wolf rider who was captured by a scouting party while foraging.</p>\n<p>When a character interrogates a prisoner, the Judge can role-play the interrogation, and/or secretly roll 2d6 on the Results of Interrogation table. The Judge will modify the roll by the interrogator’s Charisma and applicable proficiencies (e.g. Bribery, Diplomacy, Intimidation, or Seduction), and any other adjustments he deems reasonable.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Prisoner Information</strong></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>1d8</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Common Prisoner</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Valuable Prisoner</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Very Valuable Prisoner</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>The name, class, approximate level, and description of the opposing army’s leader.</td>\n<td>The name, class, approximate level, and description of the opposing army’s leader; and its total number of officers.</td>\n<td>The names, classes, approximate levels, and descriptions of the opposing army’s leader and division commanders; and its total number of officers.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>Whether there are any spies infiltrated into friendly army by opposing army.</td>\n<td>Whether there are any spies infiltrated into friendly army by opposing army; and if so, the name, class, approximate level, and description of 1 spy.</td>\n<td>Whether there are any spies infiltrated into friendly army by opposing army; and if so, the name, class, approximate level, and description of up to 1d4 spies.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>Whether the opposing army is in supply.</td>\n<td>Whether the opposing army is in supply, and the location of its supply base if so.</td>\n<td>Whether the opposing army is in supply, along with the location and description of its supply base and the route of its supply line if so.

The Judge should present this information as if it is the result of a successful roll. On a roll of <strong>3 – 5</strong>, the prisoner reveals nothing of value (he may babble incoherently, reveal information already known to the interrogator, or beg for his parents, of course). On a roll of <strong>6 – 8</strong>, the prisoner reveals one piece of information, and on a roll of <strong>9 – 11</strong> the prisoner reveals two pieces of information. On a roll of <strong>12</strong> or more, the prisoner reveals all known information.</p>\n<p>Without magic, there is no way for an interrogator to know for sure how many pieces of information a prisoner possesses, or whether the information he has shared is true or false. If magic is available, a prisoner might be <strong>bewitched</strong> into revealing the information, mentally questioned using <em>telepathy</em>, and so on.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: The elven army’s leader has CHA 16 and the Bribery proficiency. He is offering the wolf rider a month’s pay (+3 bonus). The elven army’s leader rolls 2d6 and gets an 8. Adding his CHA bonus of +2 and his Bribery bonus of +3, his adjusted total is 13. This yields an “all known information” result on the Results of Interrogation table. “I don’t know much, but I can tell you about our chieftain, Igrak, and his warband leaders....”</p>\n<h3>Stratagems</h3>\n<p>From time to time, characters may concoct <strong>stratagems</strong> to reconnoiter or scout enemy positions, or slay, deceive or trick enemy scouts. When stratagems are carried out by NPCs, the Judge may simply apply a variable die roll modifier of +1 to +3 (or -1 to -3 to an enemy) to a reconnaissance roll to reflect the stratagem, based on his assessment of the value of the stratagem.</p>\n<p>If PCs are personally carrying out the stratagem, the Judge may wish to resolve the stratagem using the <strong>Heroic Forays</strong> rules (p. XX). This would represent skirmishing with enemy scouts, killing enemy foragers, and so on. Each 1/2 point of BR at stake (at the appropriate army scale) should provide a +1 benefit to the army’s reconnaissance roll.</p>\n<h3>Hijinks</h3>\n<p>Once an opposing army has been located, leaders with access to a syndicate (or other source of perpetrators) might wish to order <strong>hijinks</strong> against the army.</p>\n<p>Before any hijinks can be performed against an army, a perpetrator must first be infiltrated into the opposing army as a spy. To undertake an infiltration hijink, the perpetrator must be a member of a race present in the opposing army’s troops, or be disguised with a successful Disguise proficiency throw in addition to the hijink throw. The perpetrator must also speak at least one the languages spoken by the opposing army’s troops and be able to wear the armor and weapons of at least one type of troop.</p>\n<p>For infiltrating to succeed, the perpetrator must make a successful Hiding throw. For each of the following proficiencies the perpetrator knows, he gains a special +1 bonus on his throw to infiltrate the army: Bribery, Disguise, Manual of Arms. Skulking proficiency grants the usual +2 bonus.</p>\n<p>If the proficiency throw succeeds, the perpetrator grants his army’s commander a +1 bonus on reconnaissance rolls made against the opposing army while he remains infiltrated (see p. XX). The infiltrated perpetrator also has the opportunity to conduct assassinating, carousing, sabotaging, slandering, spying, stealing, or subverting hijinks thereafter. A perpetrator can remain infiltrated into the opposing army until caught performing another hijink or exposed by a vagary of war (Judge’s discretion).</p>\n<p>If the proficiency throw fails, the perpetrator failed to infiltrate the enemy army. If the proficiency throw fails by 14 or more or is an unmodified 1, the perpetrator has been caught attempting to infiltrate. If a perpetrator is caught attempting to infiltrate an enemy army, the charge is sedition.</p>\n<p>Performing hijinks against enemy armies is highly risky. If a perpetrator is caught performing a hijink, very severe charges are always levied against him, and neither attorneys nor interpleaders are available. If the perpetrator is convicted, he will suffer the usual punishments. He will also be interrogated as a <strong>prisoner</strong>. If the perpetrator is 0th – 4th level, he has the information of a common prisoner; if 5th – 9th level, a valuable prisoner; if 10th level or more, a very valuable prisoner. (If the perpetrator is a PC, the Judge might allow the PC to negotiate a trade of information for a reduced sentence...)</p>\n<p>Complete rules on syndicates, perpetrators, and hijinks are explained in <strong>Hideouts and</strong> <strong>Hijinks</strong>, p. XX – XX.</p>\n",

If the opposing army is dispersed into two or more hexes, determine the proximity by counting the number of hexes between the observing army and the largest division (or other body of troops) in the opposing army. If both the observing and opposing armies are dispersed into multiple hexes, determine the proximity by counting the number of hexes between the closest unit of the observing army and the largest division in the opposing army.</p>\n<p><strong>Magic — Observation:</strong> Magic can only be used for observation during initial reconnaissance rolls, as the army commander won’t know that additional rolls are occurring as his army moves. Using magic grants a +1 bonus for each of the following spells: <em>greater clairaudiency</em>, <em>greater clairvoyancy</em>, <em>lay of the land</em>, <em>locate distance object</em>, <em>scry.</em> In addition, the following rules apply:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Lay of the Land</em> always reveals the presence of an enemy army or supply base if within the same 6-mile hex.</li>\n<li><em>Locate distant object</em> always reveals the distance and direction to the designated object (usually an enemy battle standard).</li>\n<li><em>Greater clairaudiency</em>, <em>greater clairvoyance</em>, and <em>scry</em> allow the observing army to designate a 6-mile hex upon which the magic is used. The observing army then uses either that hex or its actual hex for purposes of proximity, whichever is better. However, if the observing army designates a 6-mile hex outside of its own reconaissance range, it cannot capture prisoners from the reconnaissance roll.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The spellcaster must be able to meet the requirements of the spell in order to use it. For example, to use <em>scrying,</em> the caster must be familiar with someone in the opposing army, or already know the location of the opposing army. If an officer is protected by an <strong>amulet of indiscernibility</strong> or the spell of the same name, his location and the location of units under his direct command cannot be scried upon. This does not prevent other officers or units from the army being scried on. Only if everyofficer in the army is protected by an <strong>amulet</strong> or <em>indiscernibility</em>is their army protected from scrying.</p>\n<p>Other spells, such as <em>communion</em>or<em>contact<strong>other</strong>sphere</em>,do not modify the reconnaissance roll. However, the Judge should still provide information from these spells using the mechanics described in their spell entry.</p>\n<p><strong>Magic — Camouflage:</strong> Magical camouflage reduces the effective size of the opposing army, which makes the army harder to observe. Each <em>illusory**terrain</em>, <em>hidden**host</em>,or <em>permanent**figment</em> spell can hide one company-sized unit. For example, if an army with seven units employs<em>hidden**host</em> to disguise two units, it will count as being an army of five units (600 troops) total for purposes of army size. Even if the reconnaissance roll succeeds, the units hidden by magic will not revealed by the roll. However, interrogation of prisoners might still reveal the existence of these troops.</p>\n<p><strong>Scouting and Screening Troops:</strong> Scouting and screening troops only modify reconnaissance rolls within a limited range around them. Cavalry and flyers on garrison duty will scout and screen within the territory of the domain they garrison. Cavalry and flyers in an army on campaign will only scout and screen the 24-mile hex their army is located in and the adjacent 24-mile hexes. Reconnaissance rolls between armies two or more 24-mile hexes away will therefore not be modified. The table assumes company-sized units; treat 4 platoon-sized units as 1 unit, a battalion-sized unit as 4 units, and a brigade-scale unit as 16 units.</p>\n<p><strong>Spies:</strong> Spies can be infiltrated into an opposing army using the rules in for Hijinks (p. XX).</p>\n<p><strong>Stratagems:</strong> This represents a variable modifier that the Judge can assign based on the actions of PCs and major NPCs. See the <strong>Stratagems</strong> section below.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: A goblin army (4,320 troops) has just moved into a 24-mile hex of woods occupied by an elven army (1,200 troops). Both armies now get the chance to locate each other. The leader of the elves has a strategic ability of +2, while the leader of the goblins has a strategic ability of -1. The elves have 1 unit of giant hawks (flyers) and 2 units of horse archers (cavalry); the goblins have 16 units of wolf riders (cavalry). The elves are more familiar with the region.</p>\n<p>The elven army will make a reconnaissance roll with the following modifiers: -1 (opposing army has 6 to 20 cavalry units), -1 (opposing army has overall more cavalry and flyers units), +1 (superior ranks in military strategy), +1 (more familiar with region), +2 (can observe enemy from the air), -1 (opposing army in woods). The total bonuses and penalties add up to +1, so the Judge will roll 2d6+1 for the elves. The Judge rolls an 8, modified to 9. The elves have rolled a success!</p>\n<p>The goblin army will make a reconnaissance roll with the following modifiers: +1 (6 to 20 cavalry units), +1 (army has overall more cavalry and flyers), -1 (inferior ranks in military strategy), -1 (less familiar with region), -1 (opposing army in woods), -1 (opposing army has only 5 to 20 units). The total adds up to -2, so the Judge will roll 2d6-2 for the goblins.</p>\n<p>The Judge rolls a 5, modified to a 3; the goblins have failed to gather any information about the elves. In fact, they probably aren’t even aware there is an elven army in the area (unless they knew from a prior reconnaissance roll success).</p>\n"

The precision with which the location is known can range from a wide swath of hexes to a specific 6-mile hex.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: The modified result of the elven army’s reconnaissance roll was a 9, so the elven army had a success. The elven army is in the same 24-mile hex as the goblin army. Cross-indexing “same 24-mile hex” with “success” on the Results of the Reconnaissance Rolls table, the Judge notes that the elven army learns which 6-mile hex the goblin army occupies. He provides this information to the leader of the elven army.</p>\n<p><strong>Approximate Size:</strong> The observing army learns whether the opposing army is small (600 or fewer troops); average (600 to 3,000 troops); large (3,001 to 12,000 troops); huge (12,001 to 36,000 troops); gigantic (36,001 to 72,000 troops); or colossal (72,001 or more troops).</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: The Judge reveals that the goblin army is large (3,001 to 12,000 troops).</p>\n<p><strong>Direction of March:</strong> The observing army learns the opposing army’s direction of march in the preceding week. In most cases, this is a compass direction on the hex map. However, if the opposing army remained stationary last week, the observing army learns that instead. If the opposing army had been following a particular road, the observing army learns which road.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: The Judge reveals that the goblin army is marching southwest.</p>\n<p><strong>Number of Divisions</strong>: The observing army learns the number of divisions in the opposing army. This can be valuable intelligence as it hints at the leadership ability of the enemy general, the number of officers available to the opposing army, and the flexibility of its command.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: The Judge reveals that the goblin army is divided into four divisions.</p>\n<p><strong>Number of Units per Division:</strong> The observing army learns the number of units in each division of the opposing army. This can help identify if some divisions have particularly able commanders, or are particularly strong or weak. The observing army also learns whether the opposing army is organized into company-sized, battalion-sized or brigade-sized units.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: The Judge reveals that the goblin army’s first division has two battalion-sized units; its second division has three battalion-sized units; its third division has three battalion-sized units; and its fourth division has two battalion-sized units.</p>\n<p><strong>Type of Each Unit:</strong> The observing army learns the type of each unit it has detected, such as heavy infantry, light cavalry, war elephants, and so on. An army of cavalry and heavy infantry is obviously far more threatening than an army of conscripted peasants.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: Since the elven army only rolled a success, it does not learn the type of each unit. Had the elven army rolled a major success, the Judge would have revealed that the goblin army’s first division consisted of two battalion-sized goblin wolf rider units; its second division has four battalion-sized goblin light infantry units; its third division has three battalion-sized goblin slinger units; and its fourth division has two battalion-sized goblin wolf rider units.</p>\n<p><strong>Strength of Each Unit:</strong> The observing army learns the troop strength of each unit it has detected. This intelligence can be critically valuable as an army might turn out to consist of understrength units.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: Since the elven army only rolled a success and was not in the same 6-mile hex as the goblin army, it does not learn the strength of each unit. Had the elven army rolled a major success while sharing the same 6-mile hex as the goblin army, the Judge would have revealed that the goblin army’s first division consisted of two goblin wolf rider units of 240 troops each; its second division has four goblin light infantry units of 480 troops each; its third division has three goblin slinger units of 480 troops each; and its fourth division has two goblin wolf rider units of 240 troops each.</p>\n<p><strong>Prisoners:</strong> In some cases, a reconnaissance roll can yield <strong>prisoners</strong>! Prisoners might to be captured deserters, foragers, scouts, or even turncoats. Each prisoner will know 1d3 pieces of information. For each piece of information, roll 1d8 and cross-index the result with the appropriate column on the Prisoner Information table. If the same piece of information is rolled twice, then the information known to the prisoner is of a more detailed nature (shift one column right on the table). The Judge should make these rolls in secret and then decide the identity of the prisoner accordingly.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: The elven army rolled a success on its reconnaissance roll against the goblin army in its 24-mile hex. According to the Results of Reconnaissance table, the elven army has captured a common prisoner. The Judge secretly rolls 1d3 and scores a 2, so the prisoner will know two pieces of information. He rolls 1d4 for the first piece of information and scores a 1. Cross-indexing a roll of 1 with the “Common Prisoner” column, the Judge finds that the prisoner knows the name, race, and class of the goblin army’s leader. The Judge then rolls 1d4 for the second piece of information and scores another 1. This means the prisoner knows even more on the same topic. The Judge therefore cross-indexes a roll of 1 with the “Valuable Prisoner” column, and finds that the prisoner knows the name, class, approximate level, and description of the goblin army’s leader, and its total number of officers. The Judge decides the prisoner is a goblin wolf rider who was captured by a scouting party while foraging.</p>\n<p>When a character interrogates a prisoner, the Judge can role-play the interrogation, and/or secretly roll 2d6 on the Results of Interrogation table. The Judge will modify the roll by the interrogator’s Charisma and applicable proficiencies (e.g. Bribery, Diplomacy, Intimidation, or Seduction), and any other adjustments he deems reasonable.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Prisoner Information</strong></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>1d8</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Common Prisoner</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Valuable Prisoner</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Very Valuable Prisoner</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>The name, class, approximate level, and description of the opposing army’s leader.</td>\n<td>The name, class, approximate level, and description of the opposing army’s leader; and its total number of officers.</td>\n<td>The names, classes, approximate levels, and descriptions of the opposing army’s leader and division commanders; and its total number of officers.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>Whether there are any spies infiltrated into friendly army by opposing army.</td>\n<td>Whether there are any spies infiltrated into friendly army by opposing army; and if so, the name, class, approximate level, and description of 1 spy.</td>\n<td>Whether there are any spies infiltrated into friendly army by opposing army; and if so, the name, class, approximate level, and description of up to 1d4 spies.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>Whether the opposing army is in supply.</td>\n<td>Whether the opposing army is in supply, and the location of its supply base if so.</td>\n<td>Whether the opposing army is in supply, along with the location and description of its supply base and the route of its supply line if so.

On a roll of <strong>3 – 5</strong>, the prisoner reveals nothing of value (he may babble incoherently, reveal information already known to the interrogator, or beg for his parents, of course). On a roll of <strong>6 – 8</strong>, the prisoner reveals one piece of information, and on a roll of <strong>9 – 11</strong> the prisoner reveals two pieces of information. On a roll of <strong>12</strong> or more, the prisoner reveals all known information.</p>\n<p>Without magic, there is no way for an interrogator to know for sure how many pieces of information a prisoner possesses, or whether the information he has shared is true or false.

The “observing army” is the army making the reconnaissance roll, while the “opposing army” is the army being observed.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Reconnaissance Range** | |\n| **Opposing Army Size** | **Observing Army Must Be Within** |\n| 120 troops or less | One 24-mile hex |\n| 121 – 600 troops | Two 24-mile hexes |\n| 601 – 3000 troops | Three 24-mile hexes |\n| 3,001 troops or more | Four 24-mile hexes |\n\nThere is no particular limit to the number of reconnaissance rolls an army will make during initial reconnaissance — if there are three armies within range, it will make three reconnaissance rolls. If there is only one army within range, it will make only one reconnaissance roll.\n\nAnytime there are multiple friendly armies within one 24-mile hex, all armies in that hex are treated as a single army for purposes of initial reconnaissance rolls. For example, if there are 10 watchtowers with 1 unit of cavalry each spread across a 24-mile hex, the Judge will roll for and against them as a single army with 10 units of cavalry.\n\nIf, during the course of an acting army’s movement, it enters the same 6 mile hex as an opposing army, both the acting army and opposing army make an additional reconnaissance roll. Multiple opposing armies within one 6-mile hex are always treated as a single army.\n\nReconnaissance rolls should alwaysbe made by the Judge, so that the army leaders remain unaware of how many rolls were made, and how many they failed.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Reconnaissance Rolls** | |\n| **Modified Die Roll** | **Result** |\n| 2- | Catastrophe |\n| 3 – 5 | Failure |\n| 6 – 8 | Marginal Success |\n| 9 – 11 | Success |\n| 12+ | Major Success |\n\n### Reconnaissance Roll Procedure\n\nTo make a reconnaissance roll, the Judge rolls 2d6 and consults the Reconnaissance Rolls table. The die roll should be modified based on the Reconnaissance Modifiers table on the adjoining table. The “observing army” is the army making the reconnaissance roll, while the “opposing army” is the army being observed.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Reconnaissance Modifiers** | **Modifier** |\n| **Army Size** |  |\n| Opposing army has 600 or fewer troops total | -2 |\n| Opposing army has only 601 to 3,000 troops | -1 |\n| Opposing army has 3,001 to 12,000 troops total | 0 |\n| Opposing army has 12,001 to 36,000 troops total | +1 |\n| Opposing army has 36,001 to 72,000 troops total | +2 |\n| Opposing army has 72,001 or more troops | +3 |\n| **Proximity of Armies** |  |\n| Armies are in same 6-mile hex | +2 |\n| Armies are in adjacent 6-mile hexes | +1 |\n| Armies are in same 24-mile hex | 0 |\n| Armies are 1 or more 24-mile hexes away from each other | -1/hex |\n| **Leadership** |  |\n| Observing army’s leader has higher strategic ability than opposing army’s leader | +1 |\n| Opposing army’s leader has higher strategic ability than observing army’s leader | -1 |\n| **Magic, Spies, and Stratagems** |  |\n| Observing army can observe opposing army with magic (*greater clairvoyance*, scry*,* etc.) | Varies |\n| Opposing army can camouflage location with magic (*hidden**host*, *illusory**terrain,* etc.) | Varies |\n| Observing army has spy infiltrated within opposing army | +1/spy |\n| Observing army can observe opposing army from the air | +2 |\n| Observing army has stratagem to reconnoiter or scout enemy position (Judge’s discretion) | Varies |\n| Opposing army has stratagem to deceive or trick scouts (Judge’s discretion) | Varies |\n| **Scouting and Screening Troops** |  |\n| Observing army scouting with 6 to 20 units | +1 |\n| Observing army scouting with 21 to 100 units | +2 |\n| Observing army scouting 101 or more units | +3 |\n| Opposing army screened by 6 to 20 units | -1 |\n| Opposing army screened by 21 to 100 units | -2 |\n| Opposing army screened by 101 or more units | -3 |\n| Observing army has more cavalry units in total than opposing army | +1 |\n| Opposing army has more cavalry units in total than observing army | -1 |\n| **Terrain** |  |\n| Opposing army is in barrens (any), desert (any), grasslands (any), scrubland (low, sparse) | +1 |\n| Opposing army is in forest (taiga), hills (rocky),scrubland (high, dense), swamp (marshy) | 0 |\n| Opposing army is in forest (deciduous), hills (forested), jungle, mountains (any), swamp (scrubby, forested) | 0 |\n| Observing army is more familiar with region than opposing army | +1 |\n| Opposing army is more familiar with region than observing army | -1 |\n\n**Proximity of Armies:** If the observing army is dispersed into two or more hexes, determine the proximity by counting the number of hexes between the closest unit of the observing army and the opposing army. If the opposing army is dispersed into two or more hexes, determine the proximity by counting the number of hexes between the observing army and the largest division (or other body of troops) in the opposing army. If both the observing and opposing armies are dispersed into multiple hexes, determine the proximity by counting the number of hexes between the closest unit of the observing army and the largest division in the opposing army.\n\n**Magic — Observation:** Magic can only be used for observation during initial reconnaissance rolls, as the army commander won’t know that additional rolls are occurring as his army moves. Using magic grants a +1 bonus for each of the following spells: *greater clairaudiency*, *greater clairvoyancy*, *lay of the land*, *locate distance object*, *scry.* In addition, the following rules apply:\n\n* *Lay of the Land* always reveals the presence of an enemy army or supply base if within the same 6-mile hex.\n* *Locate distant object* always reveals the distance and direction to the designated object (usually an enemy battle standard).\n* *Greater clairaudiency*, *greater clairvoyance*, and *scry* allow the observing army to designate a 6-mile hex upon which the magic is used. The observing army then uses either that hex or its actual hex for purposes of proximity, whichever is better. However, if the observing army designates a 6-mile hex outside of its own reconaissance range, it cannot capture prisoners from the reconnaissance roll.\n\nThe spellcaster must be able to meet the requirements of the spell in order to use it. For example, to use *scrying,* the caster must be familiar with someone in the opposing army, or already know the location of the opposing army. If an officer is protected by an **amulet of indiscernibility** or the spell of the same name, his location and the location of units under his direct command cannot be scried upon. This does not prevent other officers or units from the army being scried on. Only if everyofficer in the army is protected by an **amulet** or *indiscernibility*is their army protected from scrying.\n\nOther spells, such as *communion*or*contact**other**sphere*,do not modify the reconnaissance roll. However, the Judge should still provide information from these spells using the mechanics described in their spell entry.\n\n**Magic — Camouflage:** Magical camouflage reduces the effective size of the opposing army, which makes the army harder to observe. Each *illusory**terrain*, *hidden**host*,or *permanent**figment* spell can hide one company-sized unit. For example, if an army with seven units employs*hidden**host* to disguise two units, it will count as being an army of five units (600 troops) total for purposes of army size. Even if the reconnaissance roll succeeds, the units hidden by magic will not revealed by the roll. However, interrogation of prisoners might still reveal the existence of these troops.\n\n**Scouting and Screening Troops:** Scouting and screening troops only modify reconnaissance rolls within a limited range around them. Cavalry and flyers on garrison duty will scout and screen within the territory of the domain they garrison. Cavalry and flyers in an army on campaign will only scout and screen the 24-mile hex their army is located in and the adjacent 24-mile hexes. Reconnaissance rolls between armies two or more 24-mile hexes away will therefore not be modified. The table assumes company-sized units; treat 4 platoon-sized units as 1 unit, a battalion-sized unit as 4 units, and a brigade-scale unit as 16 units.\n\n**Spies:** Spies can be infiltrated into an opposing army using the rules in for Hijinks (p. XX).\n\n**Stratagems:** This represents a variable modifier that the Judge can assign based on the actions of PCs and major NPCs. See the **Stratagems** section below.\n\nEXAMPLE: A goblin army (4,320 troops) has just moved into a 24-mile hex of woods occupied by an elven army (1,200 troops). Both armies now get the chance to locate each other. The leader of the elves has a strategic ability of +2, while the leader of the goblins has a strategic ability of -1. The elves have 1 unit of giant hawks (flyers) and 2 units of horse archers (cavalry); the goblins have 16 units of wolf riders (cavalry). The elves are more familiar with the region.\n\nThe elven army will make a reconnaissance roll with the following modifiers: -1 (opposing army has 6 to 20 cavalry units), -1 (opposing army has overall more cavalry and flyers units), +1 (superior ranks in military strategy), +1 (more familiar with region), +2 (can observe enemy from the air), -1 (opposing army in woods). The total bonuses and penalties add up to +1, so the Judge will roll 2d6+1 for the elves. The Judge rolls an 8, modified to 9. The elves have rolled a success!\n\nThe goblin army will make a reconnaissance roll with the following modifiers: +1 (6 to 20 cavalry units), +1 (army has overall more cavalry and flyers), -1 (inferior ranks in military strategy), -1 (less familiar with region), -1 (opposing army in woods), -1 (opposing army has only 5 to 20 units). The total adds up to -2, so the Judge will roll 2d6-2 for the goblins.\n\nThe Judge rolls a 5, modified to a 3; the goblins have failed to gather any information about the elves. In fact, they probably aren’t even aware there is an elven army in the area (unless they knew from a prior reconnaissance roll success).\n\n### Results of Reconnaissance Rolls\n\nA **catastrophe** means that the observing army has gathered false intelligence. The Judge should inform the observing army’s leader that he has rolled a marginal success and pretend to provide intelligence as if that were the case. However, the intelligence will be riddled with falsehoods and misinformation.\n\nA **failure** simply means the observing army has gathered no intelligence. If the opposing army has not yet been detected, then the observing army may be unaware that the observing army is there at all.\n\nA **marginal success, success**, or **major success** means the observing army has gathered some intelligence. The amount of intelligence gathered will depend on the degree of success and the proximity of the two armies, as shown on the **Results of Reconnaissance** table below.\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Results of Reconnaissance Rolls** | | | |\n| **Degree of Success** | | | |\n| **Proximity of Armies** | **Marginal Success** | **Success** | **Major Success** |\n| Same 6-mile Hex | Location (6-mile hex)  Approximate size  Direction of march  Number of divisions  Number of units per division  Common prisoner | Location (6-mile hex)  Approximate size  Direction of march  Number of divisions  Number of units per division  Type of each unit  Valuable prisoner | Location (6-mile hex)  Approximate size  Direction of march  Number of divisions  Number of units per division  Type of each unit  Strength of each unit  Very valuable prisoner |\n| Same 24-mile Hex | Location (24-mile hex)  Approximate size  Direction of march  Number of divisions | Location (6-mile hex)  Approximate size  Direction of march  Number of divisions  Number of units per division  Common prisoner | Location (6-mile hex)  Approximate size  Direction of march  Number of divisions  Number of units per division  Type of each unit  Valuable prisoner |\n| 1 – 2 24-mile Hexes | Location (within 2 24-mile hexes)  Approximate size  Direction of march | Location (24-mile hex)  Approximate size  Direction of march  Number of divisions | Location (6-mile hex)  Approximate size  Direction of march  Number of divisions  Number of units per division  Common prisoner |\n| 3 – 4 24-mile Hexes | Location (within 4 24-mile hexes)  Approximate size | Location (within 2 24-mile hexes)  Approximate size  Direction of march | Location (24-mile hex)  Approximate size  Direction of march  Number of divisions |\n\n**Location:** The observing army learns the location of the opposing army relative to its own position. The precision with which the location is known can range from a wide swath of hexes to a specific 6-mile hex.\n\nEXAMPLE: The modified result of the elven army’s reconnaissance roll was a 9, so the elven army had a success. The elven army is in the same 24-mile hex as the goblin army. Cross-indexing “same 24-mile hex” with “success” on the Results of the Reconnaissance Rolls table, the Judge notes that the elven army learns which 6-mile hex the goblin army occupies. He provides this information to the leader of the elven army.\n\n**Approximate Size:** The observing army learns whether the opposing army is small (600 or fewer troops); average (600 to 3,000 troops); large (3,001 to 12,000 troops); huge (12,001 to 36,000 troops); gigantic (36,001 to 72,000 troops); or colossal (72,001 or more troops).\n\nEXAMPLE: The Judge reveals that the goblin army is large (3,001 to 12,000 troops).\n\n**Direction of March:** The observing army learns the opposing army’s direction of march in the preceding week. In most cases, this is a compass direction on the hex map. However, if the opposing army remained stationary last week, the observing army learns that instead. If the opposing army had been following a particular road, the observing army learns which road.\n\nEXAMPLE: The Judge reveals that the goblin army is marching southwest.\n\n**Number of Divisions**: The observing army learns the number of divisions in the opposing army. This can be valuable intelligence as it hints at the leadership ability of the enemy general, the number of officers available to the opposing army, and the flexibility of its command.\n\nEXAMPLE: The Judge reveals that the goblin army is divided into four divisions.\n\n**Number of Units per Division:** The observing army learns the number of units in each division of the opposing army. This can help identify if some divisions have particularly able commanders, or are particularly strong or weak. The observing army also learns whether the opposing army is organized into company-sized, battalion-sized or brigade-sized units.\n\nEXAMPLE: The Judge reveals that the goblin army’s first division has two battalion-sized units; its second division has three battalion-sized units; its third division has three battalion-sized units; and its fourth division has two battalion-sized units.\n\n**Type of Each Unit:** The observing army learns the type of each unit it has detected, such as heavy infantry, light cavalry, war elephants, and so on. An army of cavalry and heavy infantry is obviously far more threatening than an army of conscripted peasants.\n\nEXAMPLE: Since the elven army only rolled a success, it does not learn the type of each unit. Had the elven army rolled a major success, the Judge would have revealed that the goblin army’s first division consisted of two battalion-sized goblin wolf rider units; its second division has four battalion-sized goblin light infantry units; its third division has three battalion-sized goblin slinger units; and its fourth division has two battalion-sized goblin wolf rider units.\n\n**Strength of Each Unit:** The observing army learns the troop strength of each unit it has detected. This intelligence can be critically valuable as an army might turn out to consist of understrength units.\n\nEXAMPLE: Since the elven army only rolled a success and was not in the same 6-mile hex as the goblin army, it does not learn the strength of each unit. Had the elven army rolled a major success while sharing the same 6-mile hex as the goblin army, the Judge would have revealed that the goblin army’s first division consisted of two goblin wolf rider units of 240 troops each; its second division has four goblin light infantry units of 480 troops each; its third division has three goblin slinger units of 480 troops each; and its fourth division has two goblin wolf rider units of 240 troops each.\n\n**Prisoners:** In some cases, a reconnaissance roll can yield **prisoners**! Prisoners might to be captured deserters, foragers, scouts, or even turncoats. Each prisoner will know 1d3 pieces of information. For each piece of information, roll 1d8 and cross-index the result with the appropriate column on the Prisoner Information table. If the same piece of information is rolled twice, then the information known to the prisoner is of a more detailed nature (shift one column right on the table). The Judge should make these rolls in secret and then decide the identity of the prisoner accordingly.\n\nEXAMPLE: The elven army rolled a success on its reconnaissance roll against the goblin army in its 24-mile hex. According to the Results of Reconnaissance table, the elven army has captured a common prisoner. The Judge secretly rolls 1d3 and scores a 2, so the prisoner will know two pieces of information. He rolls 1d4 for the first piece of information and scores a 1. Cross-indexing a roll of 1 with the “Common Prisoner” column, the Judge finds that the prisoner knows the name, race, and class of the goblin army’s leader. The Judge then rolls 1d4 for the second piece of information and scores another 1. This means the prisoner knows even more on the same topic. The Judge therefore cross-indexes a roll of 1 with the “Valuable Prisoner” column, and finds that the prisoner knows the name, class, approximate level, and description of the goblin army’s leader, and its total number of officers. The Judge decides the prisoner is a goblin wolf rider who was captured by a scouting party while foraging.\n\nWhen a character interrogates a prisoner, the Judge can role-play the interrogation, and/or secretly roll 2d6 on the Results of Interrogation table. The Judge will modify the roll by the interrogator’s Charisma and applicable proficiencies (e.g. Bribery, Diplomacy, Intimidation, or Seduction), and any other adjustments he deems reasonable.\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Prisoner Information** | | | |\n| **1d8** | **Common Prisoner** | **Valuable Prisoner** | **Very Valuable Prisoner** |\n| 1 | The name, class, approximate level, and description of the opposing army’s leader. | The name, class, approximate level, and description of the opposing army’s leader; and its total number of officers. | The names, classes, approximate levels, and descriptions of the opposing army’s leader and division commanders; and its total number of officers. |\n| 2 | Whether there are any spies infiltrated into friendly army by opposing army. | Whether there are any spies infiltrated into friendly army by opposing army; and if so, the name, class, approximate level, and description of 1 spy. | Whether there are any spies infiltrated into friendly army by opposing army; and if so, the name, class, approximate level, and description of up to 1d4 spies. |\n| 3 | Whether the opposing army is in supply. | Whether the opposing army is in supply, and the location of its supply base if so. | Whether the opposing army is in supply, along with the location and description of its supply base and the route of its supply line if so. The description of the supply base includes the supply base’s commander, size, stronghold value, and garrison (if any). |\n| 4 | Whether any spellcasters of 7th level or higher are serving in the opposing army. | Whether any spellcasters of 7th level or higher are serving in the opposing army, plus the name, class, and description of the opposing army’s most powerful spellcaster. | The total number of spellcasters of 7th level or higher serving in the opposing army, plus the name, class, approximate level, and description of the opposing army’s most powerful spellcaster. |\n|  |  |  |  |\n| 5 | The morale modifier of the opposing army’s leader. | The morale modifier of the opposing army’s leader and the name and morale modifier of its least-charismatic commander. | The morale modifier of the opposing army’s leader and the name and morale modifier of its most- and least-charismatic commander. |\n| 6 | The strategic stance of the opposing army. | The strategic stance of the opposing army and the number of siege weapons it is transporting. | The strategic stance of the opposing army and the number and type of siege weapons it is transporting. |\n| 7 | Type of each unit in opposing army. | Type and strength of each unit in opposing army. | Type and strength of each unit in opposing army as well as its strategic objective. |\n| 8 | Judge’s choice of any of the above or other piece of common information | Judge’s choice of any of the above or other piece of valuable information | Judge’s choice of any of the above or another piece of very valuable information |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Results of Interrogation** | |\n| **Adjusted Die Roll** | **Result** |\n| 2- | False Information |\n| 3 – 5 | Nothing |\n| 6 – 8 | One piece of information |\n| 9 – 11 | Two pieces of information |\n| 12+ | All known information |\n\nOn a roll of **2 or less**, the prisoner reveals one piece of false information. The Judge should present this information as if it is the result of a successful roll. On a roll of **3 – 5**, the prisoner reveals nothing of value (he may babble incoherently, reveal information already known to the interrogator, or beg for his parents, of course). On a roll of **6 – 8**, the prisoner reveals one piece of information, and on a roll of **9 – 11** the prisoner reveals two pieces of information. On a roll of **12** or more, the prisoner reveals all known information.\n\nWithout magic, there is no way for an interrogator to know for sure how many pieces of information a prisoner possesses, or whether the information he has shared is true or false. If magic is available, a prisoner might be **bewitched** into revealing the information, mentally questioned using *telepathy*, and so on.\n\nEXAMPLE: The elven army’s leader has CHA 16 and the Bribery proficiency. He is offering the wolf rider a month’s pay (+3 bonus). The elven army’s leader rolls 2d6 and gets an 8. Adding his CHA bonus of +2 and his Bribery bonus of +3, his adjusted total is 13. This yields an “all known information” result on the Results of Interrogation table. “I don’t know much, but I can tell you about our chieftain, Igrak, and his warband leaders....”\n\n### Stratagems\n\nFrom time to time, characters may concoct **stratagems** to reconnoiter or scout enemy positions, or slay, deceive or trick enemy scouts. When stratagems are carried out by NPCs, the Judge may simply apply a variable die roll modifier of +1 to +3 (or -1 to -3 to an enemy) to a reconnaissance roll to reflect the stratagem, based on his assessment of the value of the stratagem.\n\nIf PCs are personally carrying out the stratagem, the Judge may wish to resolve the stratagem using the **Heroic Forays** rules (p. XX). This would represent skirmishing with enemy scouts, killing enemy foragers, and so on. Each 1/2 point of BR at stake (at the appropriate army scale) should provide a +1 benefit to the army’s reconnaissance roll.\n\n### Hijinks\n\nOnce an opposing army has been located, leaders with access to a syndicate (or other source of perpetrators) might wish to order **hijinks** against the army.\n\nBefore any hijinks can be performed against an army, a perpetrator must first be infiltrated into the opposing army as a spy. To undertake an infiltration hijink, the perpetrator must be a member of a race present in the opposing army’s troops, or be disguised with a successful Disguise proficiency throw in addition to the hijink throw. The perpetrator must also speak at least one the languages spoken by the opposing army’s troops and be able to wear the armor and weapons of at least one type of troop.\n\nFor infiltrating to succeed, the perpetrator must make a successful Hiding throw. For each of the following proficiencies the perpetrator knows, he gains a special +1 bonus on his throw to infiltrate the army: Bribery, Disguise, Manual of Arms. Skulking proficiency grants the usual +2 bonus.\n\nIf the proficiency throw succeeds, the perpetrator grants his army’s commander a +1 bonus on reconnaissance rolls made against the opposing army while he remains infiltrated (see p. XX). The infiltrated perpetrator also has the opportunity to conduct assassinating, carousing, sabotaging, slandering, spying, stealing, or subverting hijinks thereafter. A perpetrator can remain infiltrated into the opposing army until caught performing another hijink or exposed by a vagary of war (Judge’s discretion).\n\nIf the proficiency throw fails, the perpetrator failed to infiltrate the enemy army. If the proficiency throw fails by 14 or more or is an unmodified 1, the perpetrator has been caught attempting to infiltrate. If a perpetrator is caught attempting to infiltrate an enemy army, the charge is sedition.\n\nPerforming hijinks against enemy armies is highly risky. If a perpetrator is caught performing a hijink, very severe charges are always levied against him, and neither attorneys nor interpleaders are available. If the perpetrator is convicted, he will suffer the usual punishments. He will also be interrogated as a **prisoner**. If the perpetrator is 0th – 4th level, he has the information of a common prisoner; if 5th – 9th level, a valuable prisoner; if 10th level or more, a very valuable prisoner. (If the perpetrator is a PC, the Judge might allow the PC to negotiate a trade of information for a reduced sentence...)\n\nComplete rules on syndicates, perpetrators, and hijinks are explained in **Hideouts and** **Hijinks**, p. XX – XX.\n"
