  "html": "<h2>Spell Types</h2>\n<p>Every spell is classified according to its <strong>spell type</strong>, which gives a broad description of what the spell is supposed to do. There are 13 different types of spells: <strong>blast</strong>, <strong>death</strong>, <strong>detection</strong>, <strong>elemental</strong>, <strong>enchantment</strong>, <strong>esoteric</strong>, <strong>healing</strong>, <strong>illusion</strong>, <strong>movement</strong>, <strong>protection</strong>, <strong>summoning</strong>, <strong>transmogrification</strong>, and <strong>wall</strong> spells. Some spells have just one type, while others have several.</p>\n<h3>List of Spell Types</h3>\n<h6>Blast Spells</h6>\n<p>Blast spells can deal damage or detrimental effects to individual targets or over areas of effect through evoking a medium such as arcane force, fire, or toxic gas*. Battering ram, mage missile,* and <em>thunderbolt</em> are examples of blast spells. (In contrast, a spell that deals damage directly through magic, such as <em>dismember</em>, is a death spell.) Blast spells usually require the caster to make an attack throw or the target to make a Blast saving throw. Blast spells that require an attack throw benefit from the Battle Magic proficiency. Some blast spells are elemental and will benefit from Elementalism proficiency.</p>\n<h6>Death Spells</h6>\n<p>Death spells can deal damage or detrimental effects to targets directly. Death spells also deal in necromantic energy, capable of draining and transferring life energy or animating the dead. <em>Animate dead</em>, <em>dismember</em>, and <em>necromantic potence</em>are examples of death spells. Death spells usually require their targets to make Death saving throws avoid their effects. Death spells benefit from the Black Lore of Zahar proficiency.</p>\n<h6>Detection Spells</h6>\n<p>Detection spells can discern or locate particular categories of creatures, powers, or objects within range. <em>Discern magic</em>,<em>locate haunting</em>, and<em>reveal ritual magic</em>are examples of detection spells. While very useful, detection spells can never be used to detect abstract or ambiguous concepts such as “danger” or “traps.” Detection spells do not benefit from any particular class powers or proficiencies in this book, although the Judge may create these if desired.</p>\n<h6>Elemental Spells</h6>\n<p>Elemental spells can conjure, destroy, or manipulate one of the fundamental elements of air, earth, fire, and water. Each elemental spell denotes its sub-type in parentheses, e.g. elemental (fire). <em>Earth’s excrescence</em>, <em>fan of flames,</em> <em>thunderbolt,</em> and <em>wall of frost</em> are examples of elemental earth, fire, air, and water spells respectively. Elemental spells benefit from the Elementalism proficiency. All elemental spells always belong to another type as well. For instance <em>fan of flames</em> is a blast and elemental fire spell, while <em>wall of frost</em> is a wall and elemental water spell.</p>\n<h6>Enchantment Spells</h6>\n<p>Enchantment spells can bewitch, dominate, halt, frighten, mesmerize, or otherwise affect the mind and will of target creatures. <em>Bewitch humanoid</em>, <em>halt monster,</em> and <em>slumber</em> are examples of enchantment spells. Enchantment spells are more difficult to detect than other types of spells. Enchantment spells benefit from the Mastery of Enchantments &amp; Illusions proficiency.</p>\n<h6>Esoteric spells</h6>\n<p>Esoteric spells can produce supernatural effects that no other type of spell can. Esoteric spells were discovered or developed in ages long past, and many of the esoteric spells written about in ancient accounts have been lost to the Tower of Knowledge. Those that remain known are some of the most important spells in existence. It is almost impossible for casters in this fallen age to create new esoteric spells or to enchant them into magic items, so many casters seek out ancient ruins and lost civilizations in the hopes of discovering them. <em>Communion, perpetual illumination,</em> and <em>rune of warding</em> are examples of esoteric spells.</p>\n<h6>Healing Spells</h6>\n<p>Healing spells can regenerate, revitalize, or even resurrect creatures. Healing spells can be reversed to damage or kill, in which case they function like weak death spells (above). *Cure light injury,*<em>neutralize poison</em>,and <em>restore life and limb</em>are examples of healing spells. Reversed healing spells can benefit from the Black Lore of Zahar proficiency, just as death spells do.</p>\n<h6>Illusory Spells</h6>\n<p>Illusion spells can create or suppress sensory data in the minds of those they affect. Illusion spells work by invoking a special pattern of light and/or sound that, when witnessed, triggers a particular hallucination in the mind of those who witnessed it. The pattern of the illusion has an objective existence but the hallucination it induces exists only in the mind. Because they exist in the mind, illusion spells are vulnerable to disbelief. A creature who successfully disbelieves an illusion sees or hears the pattern of the illusion but does not experience the hallucination it induces. <em>Chimerical figment, illusory interior,</em> and <em>mirage</em> are examples of illusion spells.Illusion spells benefit from the Mastery of Enchantments &amp; Illusions proficiency.</p>\n<h6>Movement Spells</h6>\n<p>Movement spells allow creatures to move, or be moved, directly through the application of magical power. <em>Flight,</em> <em>teleportation</em>, and <em>telekinesis</em> are all movement spells. In contrast, a spell that allows a character to fly by taking on the characteristics of a bird would be a transmogrification spell. Movement spells do not benefit from any particular class powers or proficiencies in this book, although the Judge may create these if desired.</p>\n<h6>Protection Spells</h6>\n<p>Protection spells enhance armor and saving throws, ward off foes, and provide protection from various spells, weapons, and elements, directly through magic. <em>Blast ward, holy circle,</em> and <em>shimmer</em> are examples of protection spells. In contrast, a spell that increased a character’s armor class by taking on the characteristics of a turtle would be a transmogrification spell. Protection spells benefit from the Bright Lore of Aura proficiency.</p>\n<h6>Summoning Spells</h6>\n<p>Summoning spells bring creatures from “elsewhere” to serve the spellcaster. There are three sub-types of summoning spells. Callings summon non-sapient creatures to arrive by means of their own locomotion to serve for a day. <em>Call of the wolf</em> is an example of a calling. Conjurations summon powerful creatures to serve the caster for a brief period of time. Conjured creatures are usually very powerful but actively hostile and must be controlled through concentration. <em>Conjure genie</em> is an example of a conjuration. Summonssummon one or more creatures for extended periods of time. <em>Summon hellhounds</em> is an example of a summons. Callings are widely used by divine casters, while conjurations and summons are favored by arcane casters of a Chaotic bent. Whatever their sub-type, most summoning spells take a long time to cast and some are quite restricted in the frequency and method of use. Summoning spells benefit from the Mastery of Conjuration &amp; Summoning proficiency.</p>\n<h6>Transmogrification</h6>\n<p>Transmogrification spells transform the physical and/or mental characteristics of creatures or objects. Most transmogrification spells can only affect man-sized targets; the larger the target, the more powerful the magic required. Some transmogrification spells affect the creature’s entire being, whereas others only modify a characteristic while leaving the creature mostly unaltered. <em>Adjust self, transform other</em>, and <em>winged flight</em>are examples of transmogrification spells. Transmogrification spells benefit from the Transmogrification proficiency, naturally. Some transmogrification spells have an elemental component (usually stone) and will benefit from Elementalism proficiency.</p>\n<h6>Wall Spells</h6>\n<p>Wall spells create barriers of physical, elemental, or magical substance. While drawing on similar energies as blast spells, wall spells benefit from having malleable or mobile areas of effect with very long durations. <em>Barrier of blades</em>, <em>cloud of poison</em>,and <em>wall of thunder</em>are examples of wall spells. Many wall spells also are elemental and will benefit from Elementalism proficiency. Unusual wall (one might say “off the wall”) spells can sometimes benefit from other proficiencies. For example, <em>wall of corpses</em>creates a wall made of undead, and so benefits from Black Lore of Zahar.</p>\n<h3>Spell Type Abbreviations</h3>\n<p>In the spell lists below, the following superscripts are used to designate particular types of spells. This can be helpful to the player or Judge in quickly determining which spells are affected by various proficiencies and class powers.

There are 13 different types of spells: **blast**, **death**, **detection**, **elemental**, **enchantment**, **esoteric**, **healing**, **illusion**, **movement**, **protection**, **summoning**, **transmogrification**, and **wall** spells. Some spells have just one type, while others have several.\n\n### List of Spell Types\n\n###### Blast Spells\n\nBlast spells can deal damage or detrimental effects to individual targets or over areas of effect through evoking a medium such as arcane force, fire, or toxic gas*. Battering ram, mage missile,* and *thunderbolt* are examples of blast spells. (In contrast, a spell that deals damage directly through magic, such as *dismember*, is a death spell.) Blast spells usually require the caster to make an attack throw or the target to make a Blast saving throw. Blast spells that require an attack throw benefit from the Battle Magic proficiency.

Death spells usually require their targets to make Death saving throws avoid their effects.

While very useful, detection spells can never be used to detect abstract or ambiguous concepts such as “danger” or “traps.” Detection spells do not benefit from any particular class powers or proficiencies in this book, although the Judge may create these if desired.\n\n###### Elemental Spells\n\nElemental spells can conjure, destroy, or manipulate one of the fundamental elements of air, earth, fire, and water. Each elemental spell denotes its sub-type in parentheses, e.g. elemental (fire). *Earth’s excrescence*, *fan of flames,* *thunderbolt,* and *wall of frost* are examples of elemental earth, fire, air, and water spells respectively. Elemental spells benefit from the Elementalism proficiency. All elemental spells always belong to another type as well. For instance *fan of flames* is a blast and elemental fire spell, while *wall of frost* is a wall and elemental water spell.\n\n###### Enchantment Spells\n\nEnchantment spells can bewitch, dominate, halt, frighten, mesmerize, or otherwise affect the mind and will of target creatures. *Bewitch humanoid*, *halt monster,* and *slumber* are examples of enchantment spells. Enchantment spells are more difficult to detect than other types of spells. Enchantment spells benefit from the Mastery of Enchantments & Illusions proficiency.\n\n###### Esoteric spells\n\nEsoteric spells can produce supernatural effects that no other type of spell can. Esoteric spells were discovered or developed in ages long past, and many of the esoteric spells written about in ancient accounts have been lost to the Tower of Knowledge.

Healing spells can be reversed to damage or kill, in which case they function like weak death spells (above). *Cure light injury,**neutralize poison*,and *restore life and limb*are examples of healing spells. Reversed healing spells can benefit from the Black Lore of Zahar proficiency, just as death spells do.\n\n###### Illusory Spells\n\nIllusion spells can create or suppress sensory data in the minds of those they affect.

Movement spells do not benefit from any particular class powers or proficiencies in this book, although the Judge may create these if desired.\n\n###### Protection Spells\n\nProtection spells enhance armor and saving throws, ward off foes, and provide protection from various spells, weapons, and elements, directly through magic. *Blast ward, holy circle,* and *shimmer* are examples of protection spells. In contrast, a spell that increased a character’s armor class by taking on the characteristics of a turtle would be a transmogrification spell.
