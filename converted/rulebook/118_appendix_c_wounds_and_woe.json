The effects of all permanent wounds and side effects are cumulative. There are no mundane ways to cure permanent wounds or side effects, but some effects can be temporarily suppressed with healing herbs.</p>\n<p>When a creature loses a body part, the Judge will determine whether the left or right part is lost based on the circumstances. For instance, if a creature, equipped with a sword in its right hand and shield in its left, is attacked from its right flank and has its hand chopped off, the Judge would rule that it lost its right hand. If the circumstances do not suggest one or the other side to be more likely, the Judge will roll 1d6; 1 – 3 it’s the right side, 4 – 6 it’s the left side.</p>\n",
