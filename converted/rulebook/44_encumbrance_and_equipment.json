Encumbrance is important because characters can only carry so much, and if they are heavily weighed down with equipment they cannot carry as much treasure, nor move as fast. Encumbrance is measured in <strong>stone</strong>. A stone is a historical unit of measure that varied from 8 to 14 lbs depending on what was being measured. <em><strong>ACKS</strong></em>assumes a stone weighs around 10 lbs, but it is left purposefully abstract to represent an amalgam of weight, bulk, and generally portability. Most items have an encumbrance of 1/6 of a stone; that is, six items count as one stone.
