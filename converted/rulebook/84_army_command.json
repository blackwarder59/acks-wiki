If the commander has Leadership proficiency, the commander’s leadership ability is increased by 1. If the commander is using an adjutant, his Leadership Ability is reduced by 1.

Great strategic ability demands great cunning and iron will and no truly superior officer will be lacking in either. An officer’s strategic ability score equals his bonus from either high Intellect or Will (whichever is better, minimum 0), less his penalty from low Intellect or Will (whichever is worse, maximum 0).

Seanan, with strategic ability +5, is Marcus’s adjutant. Marcus can use Seanan’s strategic ability – 1, so he functions as if his strategic ability were at +4 because of the wise counsel of his adjutant.</p>\n<p>For monstrous officers without Intellect or Will scores, their strategic ability is 0 + 1 per 5 HD, rounded down. If the monster is of generally sub-human intelligence (e.g., beastmen) strategic ability is reduced by 1. If the monster is of generally high intelligence (e.g. medusas or vampires), strategic ability is increased by 1. If the monster is of super-human intelligence (e.g., venerable dragons), it is increased by 2. The Judge might adjust the strategic ability score based on his assessment of the monster’s experience and tactical knowledge.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: An orc chieftain has a strategic ability of [(4 / 5, rounded down) – 1], or -1. A venerable red dragon (20 HD) has a strategic ability of [(20 / 5) + 2] +6.</p>\n<p><strong>Morale Modifier:</strong> A character’s morale modifier modifies rolls on the Unit Morale table (p. XX) made by units under his command. (Morale modifier does notaffect rolls on the Unit Loyalty table!) Morale modifier is equal to the character’s Charisma bonus or penalty. If the character is a barbarian, bard, explorer, fighter, or paladin of 5th level or higher, his morale modifier is increased by +1 (from his <strong>battlefield prowess</strong> class power or equivalent). If a character has Command proficiency, his morale modifier is increased by +2. If a commander uses an adjutant’s strategic ability in place of his own, he inspires less confidence in his troops, so his morale modifier is decreased by 1. Some class powers and random events can also adjust a character’s morale modifier.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: Marcus is a 9th level fighter with CHA 16 (+2) and the Command proficiency.
