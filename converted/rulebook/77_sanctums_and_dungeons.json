This vocation demands a constant supply of rare components, generally monster parts, such as the fangs of 20 hellhounds or skulls of 50 ogres. Rather than squander their time hunting beasts for these components, a mage can build a <strong>dungeon</strong> within his domain with the aim of luring monsters to lair within. There they can be harvested at the mage’s leisure. The following rules govern the creation of such dungeons.</p>\n<p>A dungeon is constructed using the Structure Costs listed in Chapter 4 (p. XX). There are no restrictions on the dungeon’s size (other than what the mage can afford) and a mage can construct multiple dungeons if desired. A mage’s dungeon(s) need not be in the same hex as his stronghold but must be within the area secured by the mage’s stronghold value (see p. XX). A mage can, but does not have to, establish a domain before, as, or after he builds a dungeon. Dungeons work best when they are in wilderness hexes with terrain favorable to monsters, such as forests, swamps, and mountains.</p>\n<p>The value of a dungeon does not count towards Minimum Stronghold Value unless it is used to secure a chaotic domain such as a beastman clanhold.</p>\n<h3>Populating a Dungeon</h3>\n<p>After the dungeon is completed, the Judge will determine the rate at which wandering monsters begin to arrive in the dungeon (as detailed in the <strong><em>ACKS II Judge’s Journal,</em> p. XX)</strong>. Wandering monsters that arrive have a percentage chance of establishing a lair in the dungeon determined by their Lair entry.</p>\n<p>If desired, the mage can seed the dungeon with treasure to help entice the monsters to stay. If a monster finds unclaimed treasure equal to or greater than the average for its Treasure Type (as explained in the <em><strong>ACKS II Judges Journal</strong></em>), the monster’s chance of making its lair within the dungeon is doubled. Monsters without a Treasure Type simply do not care about treasure, so it has no effect on them. Wandering monsters do not normally have any treasure of their own.</p>\n<p>Wandering monsters who establish a lair will choose the best available room or area within the dungeon appropriate for their size, displacing any less powerful monsters already in that area (and taking their excess treasure, if any). Monsters generally prefer to be deeper in dungeons where possible, as the depth gives added security. As a result, the more powerful monsters with the most treasure will generally be deep within the dungeon, with progressively weaker monsters closer to the entrance.</p>\n<p>When 1/3 of the areas in the dungeon have monsters lairing within them, the dungeon becomes full. The remaining rooms will be buffer zones between the different creatures. Any future monsters that arrive will displace weaker creatures out of the dungeon entirely, unless they are the sort of creature which would prefer to subjugate the current denizens (Judge’s discretion). For instance, a dragon might enslave kobolds rather than displace them.</p>\n<p>Sometimes the Judge’s encounter throws might indicate that NPC men, dwarves, or elves have arrived. These results mean that adventuring parties have come to clear the dungeon! Such encounters are best resolved by having the player whose mage owns the dungeon run a one-off session with the rest of the group playing as the wandering adventurers. The dungeon-owning mage may, of course, intervene personally when his dungeon is invaded.</p>\n<h3>Peasants and Dungeons</h3>\n<p>Like fighters, crusaders, and most other classes (but unlike thieves), the domain around the mage’s stronghold can become settled by peasant families seeking his protection and leadership. Some mages do not want the burden of rulership and drive off any peasants who attempt to settle in their land. Others, whoever, welcome the peasant families as a source of labor and revenue.</p>\n<p>However, peasant families can be demoralized if the mage builds a dungeon and does not protect the peasants from the monsters therein. If maintaining a secure peasant population is important to him, the mage can increase his monthly garrison expenditure of gold pieces. Total the experience point value of the monsters in the dungeon and divide that total by the number of peasant families (rounded up). The quotient represents the required increase in monthly garrison. If the mage fails to pay this, his domain morale will decrease by 1 per gp/family.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: Quintus’ domain has 1,100 peasant families. It also is home to a sinister dungeon with a cyclops (2,400xp), 6 ogres (1,290xp), and 60 orcs (600xp), for 4,290xp total. 4,290xp/1,100 families is 3.9, rounded to 4, so Quintus’ garrison cost is increased by 4gp per peasant. Being a stingy archmage, Quintus opts to only spend an extra 3gp per peasant (3,300gp). His domain morale decreases by 1.</p>\n<p>If desired, mages may actually hire the monsters in their dungeon to serve as the garrison. This will cause a -2 domain morale penalty if the monsters are Chaotic and the peasants are not. Mages with beastmen peasant families (see <strong>Clanholds</strong>) do not need to increase their garrison because of dungeons, unless the dungeon’s inhabitants are Lawful.</p>\n<h3>Harvesting a Dungeon for Monster Parts</h3>\n<p>It is up to the mage how he harvests the monsters within his dungeon. Some mages prefer to hire low-level adventurers to enter their dungeons to gather particular components. For instance, a mage might offer 140gp per ogre skull to adventurers exploring the maze he has created. Other mages may <strong>bewitch</strong>the monsters, stage gladiatorial battles among them, or simply kill the old and weak. Some Chaotic mages harvest adventurers...</p>\n<p>Note that a mage receives no experience for seizing his own treasure back from monsters, but wandering adventurers who seize treasure from the mage’s dungeon receive experience points normally.</p>\n<h3>Extracting Arcane Power from a Dungeon</h3>\n<p>Mages of 9th level or higher who control a dungeon may, in some circumstances, be able to extract <strong>arcane power</strong> from the monsters in the dungeon. Arcane power is measured in gp value equivalent and can be used to pay for the component cost of magical research performed by the spellcaster when he is in the dungeon’s vicinity (i.e. the same 6-mile hex).</p>\n<h6>Defining the Dungeon</h6>\n<p>Since precisely what constitutes a “dungeon” can be open to question, the mage must define the dungeon as an area (measured in square feet). The area must be contiguous. If the dungeon is multi-level, each level’s square footage must be counted separately. The mage’s sanctum (or at least his library, workshop, mortuary, and/or crossbreeding laboratory) do not have to be in the dungeon, but must be within its vicinity (the same 6-mile hex) in order to benefit from arcane power.</p>\n<h6>Attuning to the Dungeon</h6>\n<p>After defining the dungeon’s area, the mage must become attuned to it. If the mage has personally funded and overseen the construction of the dungeon, he is automatically attuned to it when it is completed.</p>\n<p>If he has conquered or otherwise taken control of an existing dungeon, he can become attuned to it by residing in the dungeon’s vicinity, not leaving the 6-mile hex for any reason for one month, and visiting the dungeon for at least one hour per 30,000 square feet each day. Each hour counts as an ancillary activity for the day. At the end of the month, the spellcaster must make a successful magic research throw with a penalty of -1 per 5,000 square feet of dungeon area. If the throw succeeds, the spellcaster has become attuned to the dungeon.</p>\n<p>Once attuned to the dungeon, the mage remains attuned until (a) he voluntarily relinquishes his attunement, (b) he attunes to another dungeon, (c) he leaves the dungeon’s vicinity for more than a month, or (d) is slain. Only one spellcaster can be attuned to any given dungeon (and any overlap is sufficient to prevent attunement). If another spellcaster is attuned to it, that spellcaster’s attunement must first be extinguished before a new spellcaster can attune.</p>\n<h6>Establishing Sovereignty over the Dungeon</h6>\n<p>In order to extract arcane power from the dungeon’s inhabitants, the mage must establish sovereignty over them. The inhabitants must worship, dread, and/or fear the spellcaster as if he were nigh god! A mage might establish sovereignty in a number of ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If the mage rolls 12+ on a reaction roll modified by Intimidation or Mystic Aura, he establishes sovereignty over the creature or creatures affected by the roll;</li>\n<li>If the mage successfully recruits a tribal chieftain (or similar leader) as a henchmen, he establishes sovereignty over the chief and his tribe; and/or</li>\n<li>If the mage slays the most powerful monster in the dungeon, and the slaying is known to be by him, he establishes sovereignty over the other monsters in the dungeon, provided they are of lower HD than the spellcaster and the slain monster.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Judge can permit other methods using the above as guidelines. Only one mage can be sovereign over a dungeon. If new monsters arrive, the mage must establish sovereignty over them if he is to extract arcane power from them.</p>\n<h6>Extracting Arcane Power</h6>\n<p>Each day, the mage extracts arcane power equal to 2% of the XP value of the monsters inhabiting the dungeon over whom he has sovereignty. Arcane power is ephemeral and cannot be stored. It must be spent within the month it is accumulated.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: Quintus’ domain is home to a sinister dungeon with a cyclops (2,400 XP), 6 ogres (1,290 XP), and 60 orcs (600 XP), for 4,290 XP total. He has sovereignty over all of them. Therefore, Quintus gains (.02gp / XP x 4290 XP) = 85gp value per day, or 2,550gp value per month, of arcane power that he can use for magic research.</p>\n<h6>Arcane and Divine Power Conflict</h6>\n<p>Nothing prohibits a mage from calling a local town his “dungeon,” terrifying the peasants, and extracting arcane power from them. However, deities and their associated clergy do not appreciate having their worship usurped. Mages who seek to extract arcane power from human and demi-human realms will certainly be confronted by the servants and soldiers of the gods.</p>\n<p>A mage who establishes his sovereignty over a dungeon can be served by a crusader who also extracts divine power from the same creatures. (Mathematically, this is because a crusader takes 10% of a creature’s divine power, 10% of its divine power remains in its corpse, and the god takes the other 80%.)</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: Imagine that instead of various beastmen, Quintus’s “dungeon” is actually a settlement of 200 families, for a total of 1,000 peasants (5,000 XP total). Quintus collects (.02gp x 5000 XP) = 100gp per day of arcane power, or 700gp per week. Quintus’s friend Balbus serves as the chaplain for the settlement. Balbus collects 4gp of divine power per 10 families per week, or (200 families x 4gp / 10 families) = 80gp per week. In total, 780gp per week is “extracted” from the peasants.

Some Chaotic mages harvest adventurers...\n\nNote that a mage receives no experience for seizing his own treasure back from monsters, but wandering adventurers who seize treasure from the mage’s dungeon receive experience points normally.\n\n### Extracting Arcane Power from a Dungeon\n\nMages of 9th level or higher who control a dungeon may, in some circumstances, be able to extract **arcane power** from the monsters in the dungeon. Arcane power is measured in gp value equivalent and can be used to pay for the component cost of magical research performed by the spellcaster when he is in the dungeon’s vicinity (i.e. the same 6-mile hex).\n\n###### Defining the Dungeon\n\nSince precisely what constitutes a “dungeon” can be open to question, the mage must define the dungeon as an area (measured in square feet). The area must be contiguous. If the dungeon is multi-level, each level’s square footage must be counted separately. The mage’s sanctum (or at least his library, workshop, mortuary, and/or crossbreeding laboratory) do not have to be in the dungeon, but must be within its vicinity (the same 6-mile hex) in order to benefit from arcane power.\n\n###### Attuning to the Dungeon\n\nAfter defining the dungeon’s area, the mage must become attuned to it. If the mage has personally funded and overseen the construction of the dungeon, he is automatically attuned to it when it is completed.\n\nIf he has conquered or otherwise taken control of an existing dungeon, he can become attuned to it by residing in the dungeon’s vicinity, not leaving the 6-mile hex for any reason for one month, and visiting the dungeon for at least one hour per 30,000 square feet each day. Each hour counts as an ancillary activity for the day. At the end of the month, the spellcaster must make a successful magic research throw with a penalty of -1 per 5,000 square feet of dungeon area. If the throw succeeds, the spellcaster has become attuned to the dungeon.\n\nOnce attuned to the dungeon, the mage remains attuned until (a) he voluntarily relinquishes his attunement, (b) he attunes to another dungeon, (c) he leaves the dungeon’s vicinity for more than a month, or (d) is slain. Only one spellcaster can be attuned to any given dungeon (and any overlap is sufficient to prevent attunement). If another spellcaster is attuned to it, that spellcaster’s attunement must first be extinguished before a new spellcaster can attune.\n\n###### Establishing Sovereignty over the Dungeon\n\nIn order to extract arcane power from the dungeon’s inhabitants, the mage must establish sovereignty over them. The inhabitants must worship, dread, and/or fear the spellcaster as if he were nigh god! A mage might establish sovereignty in a number of ways:\n\n* If the mage rolls 12+ on a reaction roll modified by Intimidation or Mystic Aura, he establishes sovereignty over the creature or creatures affected by the roll;\n* If the mage successfully recruits a tribal chieftain (or similar leader) as a henchmen, he establishes sovereignty over the chief and his tribe; and/or\n* If the mage slays the most powerful monster in the dungeon, and the slaying is known to be by him, he establishes sovereignty over the other monsters in the dungeon, provided they are of lower HD than the spellcaster and the slain monster.\n\nThe Judge can permit other methods using the above as guidelines. Only one mage can be sovereign over a dungeon. If new monsters arrive, the mage must establish sovereignty over them if he is to extract arcane power from them.\n\n###### Extracting Arcane Power\n\nEach day, the mage extracts arcane power equal to 2% of the XP value of the monsters inhabiting the dungeon over whom he has sovereignty. Arcane power is ephemeral and cannot be stored. It must be spent within the month it is accumulated.\n\nEXAMPLE: Quintus’ domain is home to a sinister dungeon with a cyclops (2,400 XP), 6 ogres (1,290 XP), and 60 orcs (600 XP), for 4,290 XP total. He has sovereignty over all of them. Therefore, Quintus gains (.02gp / XP x 4290 XP) = 85gp value per day, or 2,550gp value per month, of arcane power that he can use for magic research.\n\n###### Arcane and Divine Power Conflict\n\nNothing prohibits a mage from calling a local town his “dungeon,” terrifying the peasants, and extracting arcane power from them. However, deities and their associated clergy do not appreciate having their worship usurped. Mages who seek to extract arcane power from human and demi-human realms will certainly be confronted by the servants and soldiers of the gods.\n\nA mage who establishes his sovereignty over a dungeon can be served by a crusader who also extracts divine power from the same creatures. (Mathematically, this is because a crusader takes 10% of a creature’s divine power, 10% of its divine power remains in its corpse, and the god takes the other 80%.)\n\nEXAMPLE: Imagine that instead of various beastmen, Quintus’s “dungeon” is actually a settlement of 200 families, for a total of 1,000 peasants (5,000 XP total). Quintus collects (.02gp x 5000 XP) = 100gp per day of arcane power, or 700gp per week. Quintus’s friend Balbus serves as the chaplain for the settlement. Balbus collects 4gp of divine power per 10 families per week, or (200 families x 4gp / 10 families) = 80gp per week. In total, 780gp per week is “extracted” from the peasants.
