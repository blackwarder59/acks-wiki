There are three types of hirelings. <strong>Henchmen</strong> are NPC sidekicks, companions, and associates. Henchmen are typically very loyal and are willing to take reasonable risks; in particular, they are the only sort of hireling who will generally accompany an adventurer into a dungeon, lair, or ruin. <strong>Mercenaries</strong> are hired soldiers, and will guard, patrol, and otherwise serve in wilderness settings, but only as part of a larger force, not an adventuring party. <strong>Specialists</strong> are hired individuals who have a particular trade or who have special knowledge; they will rarely go on adventures at all unless it is directly related to their specialty. <strong>Followers</strong> are a special type of hireling that only becomes available to characters of 9th level or higher who have established a stronghold (see p. XX). Followers will undertake the same tasks as henchmen.</p>\n<p>While adventurers often wish to hire as many hirelings as they can afford, hirelings are not available in unlimited numbers. Indeed, in small villages or remote outposts, they may not be available at all. As with equipment, the amount available will be determined by the <strong>market class</strong> within which the adventurers are recruiting hirelings. The <strong>Hireling Availability by Market Class</strong> tables shows how many of each type of henchman, mercenary or specialist is available in each type of market, and at what wage. Some values will indicate a percentage chance; this is the chance of that level of hireling being present at all. One half of the hirelings (rounded up) become available within the first week the adventurers enter the market. One quarter (rounded down, minimum 1) become available during the second week. The remainder of the hirelings become available in the third week.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: Marcus is in Cyfaraun, a city of 20,000 (Class III market). He wants to hire a sage and some heavy infantry. There is a 65% chance of 1 sage being present; unfortunately, the Judge rolls a 98, and Marcus can’t find one available. His search for the heavy infantry goes better, as the Judge’s roll of 3d8 yields 22. Marcus finds 11 of these in his first week of searching, 5 more in his second week, and the remaining 6 in his third week.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Market</strong>  <strong>Class</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Cost Per Week</strong>  <strong>Per Hireling Type</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>I</td>\n<td>1d6+15gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>II</td>\n<td>1d10+10gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>III</td>\n<td>1d8+5gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>IV</td>\n<td>1d6+3gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>V</td>\n<td>1d6gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>VI</td>\n<td>1d3gp</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>PCs might sometimes find potential hirelings while on adventures. Otherwise, in order to find hirelings, the PCs must carouse in pubs, post notices of help wanted, hand out fliers, and seek out adventuring companies, mercenary brotherhoods, or professional guilds. These count as ancillary activities and cost money. Each week that the adventurers are in the market for hirelings, they must pay the fee listed on the adjoining table. This fee is per specific type of hireling, i.e. each type of mercenary or specialist.</p>\n<h3>Recruiting Hirelings</h3>\n<p>Hirelings are recruited through negotiation. The Judge plays the roles of the NPCs the PCs attempt to hire. Henchmen are typically hired for a half-share of treasure found and a monthly wage for food, lodging and expenses (based on level, see below). Mercenaries and specialists are typically hired for a flat monthly wage, which varies depending on the type of specialist or mercenary (see below). Mercenaries will expect spoils of war after battles and sieges. Henchmen, mercenaries, and specialists will have equipment appropriate to their profession, class, or level. Adventurers may provide additional equipment to their hirelings.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Reaction to Hiring Offer</strong></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Adjusted Die Roll</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Result</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2-</td>\n<td>Refuse and slander</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3 – 5</td>\n<td>Refuse</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6 – 8</td>\n<td>Try Again</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9 – 11</td>\n<td>Accept</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12+</td>\n<td>Accept with élan</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>After the offers are made, the Judge will make a <strong>reaction roll</strong> of 2d6 on the Reaction to Hiring Offer table to decide the potential hireling’s reactions, modified by the prospective employer’s Charisma bonus or penalty. If proficient, the prospective employer can use Diplomacy, Intimidation, Mystic Aura, and/or Seduction to persuade the hireling to join. The prospective employer can also offer a signing bonus. A signing bonus worth one week’s pay for the hireling grants a +1 bonus; a month’s pay provides a +2 bonus, and a year’s pay provides a +3 bonus on the reaction roll. (A prospective employer with Bribing proficiency can use it when offering a signing bonus without risk of being charged with a crime.) The Judge might apply any other adjustments he feels are appropriate based on the circumstances.</p>\n<p><strong>Refuse and slander</strong> means that all further reaction rolls made towards that adventurer in the given town or region will be at a penalty of -1 due to unkind words said by the NPC to his fellows. If the adventurer tries again in a different town, the penalty does not apply. <strong>Refuse</strong> simply means the NPC declines the offer.</p>\n<p>If a <strong>Try again</strong> result is rolled, the potential hireling is reluctant, and needs more convincing; the adventurer must “sweeten the deal” in order to get an additional roll, such as by offering more pay, a magic item, or other appealing suggestion. If the adventurer makes no better offer, treat <strong>Try again</strong> as a <strong>Refusal</strong> result.</p>\n<p><strong>Accept</strong> means that the NPC has agreed to become the character’s hireling for the stated terms. <strong>Accept with élan</strong> means the offer is accepted with very good spirit, and the hireling gains a +1 bonus to his loyalty score.</p>\n<h6>Recruiting After a Failed Attempt</h6>\n<p>Sometimes an adventurer will attempt to recruit a hireling that just rejected the employment offer of one or more other adventurer(s) in the same party. The following rules apply:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Each subsequent attempt suffers a cumulative -1 penalty, representing the hireling’s growing contempt for the “desperate” party attempting to hire him.</li>\n<li>If any of the attempts ever result in a reaction of refuse and slander, no further attempts can be made to recruit that hireling by any adventurer in the party.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>From time to time, enterprising adventurers might try to pretend “not to know each other” in order to avoid the penalties for making multiple attempts to recruit a hireling into the same party. Nothing precludes this, but if and when the hireling discovers he has unknowingly hired into comradeship with someone who he had previously rejected, it counts as a calamity (see p. XX).</p>\n<h6>Transferring Employment of a Hireling</h6>\n<p>Sometimes a hireling might be recruited into a party by one adventurer (e.g. one with high CHA) with the intent that that the hireling will actually be employed by another adventurer in the party. At other times a hireling might be recruited into a party by one adventurer and then later transferred to a different adventurer’s employment, perhaps due to the death or incapacity of the original employer, perhaps so that the original employer can hire a new henchman, etc.</p>\n<p>When a hireling is transferred from the employ of one adventurer to another in the same party, the hireling’s loyalty and morale scores are immediately recalculated based on the Charisma, proficiencies, and class powers of the hireling’s new employer. The transfer then counts as a calamity (p. XX).</p>\n<h6>Hireling Availability by Market

Loyalty is a hireling’s fidelity to his employer. A hireling can have a high morale but low loyalty — a treacherous berserker, for example, might have +4 morale (he would never flee in combat) but -4 loyalty (he’d betray his employer). A hireling can also have a high loyalty and low morale. For instance, a cowardly accountant might be impossible to bribe and committed to lifetime service to his employer, but he’d flee at the merest sight of a beastman.</p>\n<h6>Loyalty</h6>\n<p>Loyalty can range from -4 to +4. Most henchmen, mercenaries, specialists, and followers begin with a loyalty of 0. Bladedancer and crusader followers begin with a loyalty score of +4. Mercenary officers (but not troops) begin with a loyalty of -2. Ruffians have a loyalty of -2 unless they are members of their employer’s syndicate (see p. XX). Creatures forced into servitude begin with loyalty scores of -4. The loyalty score is then modified by the employer’s Charisma modifier. Add +1 if the employer has the Blood of Ancient Kings class power and add +1 if the hireling rolled “Accept with élan” on his Reaction to Hiring roll. Over time, a hireling’s loyalty score will change based on how he fares in the adventurer’s employ:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>+1 permanent increase each time the employer rolls Fanatic Loyalty on a Hireling Loyalty roll.</li>\n<li>-1 permanent decrease each time the employer rolls Grudging Loyalty on a Hireling Loyalty roll.</li>\n<li>+1 permanent increase each time the hireling gains a level while in the employer’s service.</li>\n<li>-1 permanent decrease each time the hireling suffers a calamity while in the employer’s service.</li>\n<li>-1 decrease each time the hireling suffers a permanent wound from being critically wounded until cured or compensated.</li>\n<li>-2 decrease each time the hireling suffers a permanent wound from being grievously wounded until cured or compensated.</li>\n<li>-3 decrease each time the hireling suffers a permanent wound from being mortally wounded until cured or compensated.</li>\n<li>-1 permanent decrease each time the hireling suffers a moderate side effect from tampering with mortality.</li>\n<li>-2 permanent decrease each time the hireling suffers a major side effect from tampering with mortality.</li>\n<li>-2 permanent decrease each time other hirelings in the adventurer’s employ are incapacitated or killed and are not magically restored even though funds were available to do so.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A calamity occurs anytime a hireling has to go without rations or wages; suffers an enervation, curse, or magical disease; is reduced to 0 hp or less; or other similarly dire outcomes (Judge’s discretion).</p>\n<p>A hireling must make a roll on the Hireling Loyalty table each time he suffers a calamity and each time he advances in experience level. The Judge secretly rolls 2d6 and adds the hireling’s loyalty score to decide how the henchman responds to the recent events. The Judge might apply adjustments to this roll, probably no more than ±2, depending on the circumstances.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Hireling Loyalty</strong></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Adjusted Die Roll (2d6)</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Result</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2-</td>\n<td>Hostility</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3 – 5</td>\n<td>Resignation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6 – 8</td>\n<td>Grudging Loyalty</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9 – 11</td>\n<td>Loyalty</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12+</td>\n<td>Fanatic Loyalty</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Hostility</strong> means that the hireling immediately leaves the service of the employer, and will consider him a rival and enemy in the future. The hireling can never be attracted to the character’s employ again. A result of <strong>Resignation</strong> means the hireling immediately leaves the character’s employment, but he bears no especially ill will to his former employer, and could be recruited to work for the character again in the future.</p>\n<p><strong>Grudging Loyalty</strong> means the hireling is reluctant to continue in the employer’s service, but sees no better options. The hireling’s loyalty score is reduced by 1. <strong>Loyalty</strong> means that hireling will continue in the character’s service with enthusiasm. <strong>Fanatic Loyalty</strong> means hireling has become a dedicated and sworn servant of the character. His loyalty score increases by +1.</p>\n<p>Regardless of modifiers, an unmodified roll of 2 is never better than Resignation, and an unmodified result of 12 is never worse than Loyalty.</p>\n<h6>Morale</h6>\n<p>Morale can range from -4 to +4. Hirelings begin with a Morale based on their specialty, class, and level. Most specialists have a morale score of -2, but rowers and sailors have morale of -1; navigators, captains, and scouts have morale 0; and marshals, master mariners, and mercenary officers have morale +1. Mercenaries have a morale score of -1 to +2. Henchmen have a morale score equivalent to a mercenary with similar equipment; if capable of casting spells, their minimum morale score is 0. Bladedancer and crusader followers have a Morale score of +4. Additional modifiers can apply to Morale score, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A permanent +1 bonus to morale score when a 0th-level hireling gains his first experience level (or additional HD)</li>\n<li>A permanent +1 bonus to morale score when a hireling gains his 5th experience level or HD.</li>\n<li>A permanent +1 bonus to morale score for conscripts levied from domains with Steadfast or Stalwart morale (see p. XX).</li>\n<li>A permanent -1 penalty to morale score for conscripts levied from domains with Apathetic or Demoralized domain morale.</li>\n<li>A temporary -3 to +3 modifier to morale Score when personally lead by a character with a Charisma bonus or penalty.</li>\n<li>A temporary +2 bonus to morale score when personally led by a character with Command proficiency.</li>\n<li>A temporary +1 bonus to morale score when personally led by a character of 5th level or higher in appropriate circumstances.</li>\n<li>A temporary +1 bonus to morale score when subject toInspire Courage*, holy blessing,* and other effects.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The combined total of a character’s modifier to his hireling’s morale scores is referred to as his <strong>morale modifier</strong> and plays a major role in warfare (p. XX).</p>\n<p>From time to time, the Judge might require a hireling to roll on the Hireling Obedience table. A roll might be required if the hireling is ordered to go on an expedition into unexplored wilderness hexes; ordered to enter a dungeon the party has not entered before; asked to personally perform a notably dangerous task; asked to work overtime in an urban settlement; or other circumstances. No roll should be required for routine tasks such as travel in civilized areas, standing guard, etc. The Judge secretly rolls 2d6 and adds the hireling’s morale score to decide how the hireling responds.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Hireling Obedience</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Adjusted Die Roll (2d6)</td>\n<td><strong>Result</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2-</td>\n<td>Refuses</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3 – 5</td>\n<td>Begrudging</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6+</td>\n<td>Compliant</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Refuses</strong> means thatthe hireling is unwilling to follow orders. If the employer insists, permanently reduce the hireling’s loyalty score by 1, then roll again on Hireling Obedience. <strong>Begrudging</strong> means the hireling carries out the task with the minimum of enthusiasm. He complains, sighs, bitches, and moans. If begrudging a journey or dungeon, he suffers a -1 penalty to any loyalty rolls for that arise due to the adventure. If begrudging a specific task in a dungeon, he suffers a -1 penalty to proficiency throws on the task and ceases the activity after one turn (10 minutes) unless ordered to continue. If asked to work overtime in a settlement, his productivity is reduced by one proficiency rank or one class level, whichever is worse, and he ceases the activity after a work-week unless ordered to continue. <strong>Compliant</strong> meansthat the hireling carries out the task to the best of his ability. Hireling Obedience rolls do not automatically fail on an unmodified 2, so a +4 or higher modifier is sufficient to guarantee orders are carried out.</p>\n<p>At his discretion, the Judge might apply situational modifiers to the roll. Examples of possible modifiers are listed below.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Situation</td>\n<td>Modifier</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td>Employer personally doing task, dungeon, journey, or work alongside hireling</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>+1</td>\n<td>Adventurer other than employer doing task, dungeon, journey, or work alongside hireling</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>+0</td>\n<td>Other hirelings doing task, dungeon, journey, or work alongside hireling</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>-1</td>\n<td>Hireling doing task, dungeon, journey, or work alone</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td>Task is customary for hireling’s profession or class (e.g. search for traps for thief, bash door for fighter)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>+0</td>\n<td>Task exposes hireling to small risk similar to what others in party face</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>-1</td>\n<td>One or more henchmen were incapacitated, killed, or captured in the last month or most recent adventure</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>-1</td>\n<td>Task exposes hireling to more risk than what others in party face</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>-2</td>\n<td>Task exposes hireling to great risk of life and limb that others in party are not exposed to</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>-5</td>\n<td>Task exposes hireling to extraordinary risk of incapacitation, death, capture, etc.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>-5</td>\n<td>Hireling is a mercenary ordered to undertake adventuring activities outside the norm</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>Hirelings might also have to make morale rolls when they lose a substantial amount of hp in combat or the party as a whole suffers severe casualties or shocks. See p. XX for more details.</p>\n<h3>Henchmen</h3>\n<p>Henchmen should be rolled up with attributes, classes, hit points, and equipment, just like player characters. Henchmen are typically paid a monthly fee for food, lodging and expenses as well as a half-share of any treasure discovered on an adventure. A henchmen’s monthly fee is based on his level, as noted on the Henchmen Monthly Wage table, below. A henchman who is given a domain to rule as a vassal does not need to be paid a wage if the domain income is equal to or greater than his wage. However, he will thereafter only adventure with his lord when called to council (p. XX).</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: An adventuring party has just recovered 4,000gp in treasure. The party consists of Norden (a player character), Elaria (a PC), Caleför (a PC), and Caleför’s two henchmen, Drakima and Zelicus. Each adventurer gets a full share of treasure, while each henchman gets a half-share. The treasure is therefore divided among 4 shares, with Norden, Elaria, and Caleför each getting 1,000gp and Drakima and Zelicus each getting 500gp.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Henchmen Monthly Wage</strong></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Class Level</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Monthly Wage (gp)</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Class Level</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Monthly Wage (gp)</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>3,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>25</td>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>7,250</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>50</td>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>12,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>100</td>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>32,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>200</td>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>50,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>400</td>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>135,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>800</td>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>350,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>1,600</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>A 1st level employer can only hire 0th level henchmen. A 2nd level employer can hire 0th or 1st level henchmen. A 3rd or 4th level employer can hire henchmen of up to 2nd level. A 5th or 6th level character can hire henchmen of up to 3rd level. A 7th level or higher employer can hire henchmen of up to 4th level, plus one henchman level per employer level above 7th. (Henchmen of greater than 4th level are not generally for hire on the market, but they can sometimes be found on adventures.) The foregoing notwithstanding, a domain ruler can hire henchmen of any level below his own.</p>\n<p>If there is no way for henchmen to directly know the level of the PC employer, they will use the employer’s appearance and living expenses as evidence for his level. Profligate adventurers might be able to fool a powerful henchman into working for them. However, if a henchman ever concludes he is more powerful than his employer, it is cause for an immediate Hireling Loyalty roll (q.v.) at a penalty of -1 per apparent difference in level.</p>\n<p>A player character may hire at most 4 henchmen, adjusted by the character’s Charisma bonus or penalty and certain class powers and proficiencies. Any attempts to hire more than this number of henchmen will cause the character to lose one of his existing henchmen. Mercenaries, specialists, and followers do not count towards a character’s maximum number of henchmen, since they do not require the same level of personal loyalty.</p>\n<p>It is not the intent of <em><strong>ACKS</strong></em>that henchmen be treated as “extra player characters.” A henchman is an ally and friend of the character, not an extension of the player. It is up to the Judge to decide the extent to which a player directly controls his character’s henchmen at any moment. Allowing the player to control his character’s henchmen is usually convenient, but that convenience does not reflect the reality of the game world, in which the henchman is an independent individual and the player character has limited ability to order them around. Therefore, in some circumstances, another player should be given control of henchmen, or the Judge should control them. In particular, some players will purposefully bring lots of henchmen on adventures in a deliberate attempt to “monopolize the spotlight.” This is both unrealistic within the game world, unfair to the other players, and detrimental to speed of play. In such circumstances, the Judge should allocate control of those henchmen to other players or direct them himself. Judges interested in how the designer handles this issue can watch the Grey Brotherhood Actual Play series on YouTube.</p>\n<p>Henchmen gain experience when they participate in an adventure; however, as they are under the command of a player character, only one-half of a share of XP is allocated to each henchman. See <strong>Earning Experience from Adventures</strong> for more information.</p>\n<p>Henchmen cannot themselves have henchmen unless they rule domains appropriate to their level. A domain is appropriate to their level if monthly domain income is at least equal to 50% of their wage. With Judge’s approval, mercantile income or army command can substitute for land. Income from a domain provided by his employer counts against a henchman’s monthly wage.</p>\n<h3>Mercenaries</h3>\n<p>Mercenaries are generally hired to garrison a stronghold or wage war in military campaigns. Mercenaries are not adventurers and attempting to use them as such usually ends in calamity. The Judge will determine what constitutes a military campaign and what constitutes an adventure depending on the overall circumstances. In general:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mercenaries will accompany adventurers on wilderness expeditions or sea journeys in settled territory and/or along established trade routes that pass through unsettled territory. They will not assist in searching unsettled territory around the trade route for monster lairs unless personally led, however.</li>\n<li>Mercenaries will accompany adventurers on wilderness expeditions or sea journeys into unsettled territory if on a campaign towards a known military or mercantile objective likely to yield substantial benefit for the mercenaries (“save your homeland” “get rich” etc.). They will not assist in searching the unsettled territory en route unless personally led, however.</li>\n<li>Mercenaries will accompany explorers (including NPC scout specialists) on wilderness expeditions into unsettled territory provided the explorers and mercenaries are under orders to evade all encounters, to a max of one platoon per explorer.</li>\n<li>Mercenaries will not accompany adventurers on wilderness expeditions or sea journeys into unsettled territory in other circumstances unless personally lead.</li>\n<li>Mercenaries will not accompany adventurers on dungeon delves, even if personally led. However, they will participate in sieges and assaults on dungeons if present in sufficient numbers to entirely blockade the dungeon or if personally led.</li>\n<li>Mercenaries count as personally lead if each platoon (30 infantry or 15 cavalry) has an adventurer or henchman of at least 3rd level serving as its lieutenant.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Mercenary Troop Type table below list the typical wages, equipment, and morale of mercenaries based on type. In addition to the weapons and armor noted for their troop type, all mercenaries have the following equipment: military tunic, cloak, pair of sandals, backpack, laborer’s tools, 4 stakes and mallet, mess kit, small tent, 2 wool blankets, and a waterskin. Cavalry mercenaries will also have a saddle, bridle, 2 saddlebags, and grooming kit. Missile-armed mercenaries will have 20 rounds of ammunition.</p>\n<p>The costs listed are the mercenaries’ wages only. The cost of armorers to make and repair troop armor and weapons, stablehands to groom horses, caravans to provide supplies while in the field, and other miscellaneous expenses are not included. Mercenaries in garrison need only be paid their wages, but mercenaries on campaign must be provided with supplies and will expect a share of military plunder in addition to wages. See <strong>Armies</strong> (p. XX) and <strong>Maneuvers</strong> (p. XX) for more troop types and advanced rules. Morale scores are for human troops. Demi-human morale will be 1 point higher.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>Gp Wage per Month</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td>Morale</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mercenary Troop Type</td>\n<td><em>Man</em></td>\n<td><em>Dwarf</em></td>\n<td><em>Elf</em></td>\n<td><em>Goblin</em></td>\n<td><em>Orc</em></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Peasants (spear)</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Light Infantry (3 javelins, short sword, shield, leather armor)</td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>21</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>-1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Heavy Infantry (spear, short sword, shield, banded plate armor)</td>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>27</td>\n<td>30</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Slingers (sling, short sword, shield)</td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Bowmen (short bow, short sword, leather armor)</td>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>27</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>-1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Composite Bowmen (composite bow, short sword, leather)</td>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Crossbowmen (arbalest, short sword, shield, chain mail)</td>\n<td>18</td>\n<td>27</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Longbowmen (long bow, short sword, chain mail)</td>\n<td>18</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>40</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Light Cavalry (3 javelins, sword, shield, scale armor, light warhorse)</td>\n<td>30</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>50</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>+1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mounted Crossbowmen (crossbow, short sword, plate armor, mule)</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>55</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>+1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Horse Archers (composite bow, scimitar, leather armor, light warhorse)</td>\n<td>45</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>90</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>+1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Medium Cavalry (lance, sword, shield, lamellar, scale-barded medium warhorse)</td>\n<td>45</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>+1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Heavy Cavalry (lance, sword, shield, plate armor, chain-barded medium warhorse)</td>\n<td>60</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cataphract Cavalry (comp. bow, lance, sword, plate, lamellar-barded medium warhorse)</td>\n<td>75</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>160</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td>+2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Camel Archers (composite bow, scimitar, leather armor, camel)</td>\n<td>30</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>+1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Camel Lancers (composite bow, lance, scimitar, chain mail, camel)</td>\n<td>45</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>War Elephants** (lamellar barding, howdah, 6 x comp. bows, lances, scale armor)</td>\n<td>360</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Wolf Riders (spear, scimitar, shield, leather armor, dire wolf)</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>45</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Boar Riders (lance, scimitar, shield, leather armor, giant boar)</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>85</td>\n<td>+1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>*War elephants are hired by elephant and wages include 6 troops in howdah.</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h3>Specialists</h3>\n<p>Hundreds of different types of specialist exist in civilized realms; the list below is not exhaustive, and the Judge may create more kinds of specialists as needed using the rules in the <strong>Proficiencies</strong> chapter. Player characters with appropriate <strong>proficiencies</strong> may act as specialists if desired.</p>\n<p><strong>Alchemist</strong> (250gp/month): Alchemists are valuable specialists because they dedicate their expertise to creating potions and other concoctions. An alchemist can identify common alchemical substances by aroma and color in one round with a proficiency throw of 3+. He can attempt to identify which parts of a monster are special components with a proficiency throw of 7+. He can also attempt to extract toxin from poisonous plants. Each attempt requires one day and a proficiency throw of 12+ for fresh plants and 16+ for dried plants. If the throw succeeds, the alchemist extracts one dose of poison. If the throw fails, the alchemist accidentally spoils the plants. If the throw fails on an unmodified 1, the alchemist has accidentally exposed himself to the toxin and must immediately make a successful Poison save or suffers its effects. He can brew potions as if he were a 5th level mage. See <strong>Magic Research</strong> in Chapter 8 (p. XX).</p>\n<p><strong>Animal Trainer</strong> (domestic animals, 25gp/month; wild animals, 75gp/month; dire, giant or prehistoric animals 150gp/month; monstrosities or vermin, 250/gp month): Animal trainers knows how to tame and train animals of various sorts. The most common and least expensive animal trainers are those that can train domesticated animals such as dogs or horses. Less common and more expensive are animal trainers who can train wild animals, giant or prehistoric animals, or even bestial monstrosities. Basic rules for training animals can be found in the Proficiencies section (p. XX) and advanced rules can be found in other sourcebooks such as <em><strong>Lairs &amp; Encounters</strong></em> or the <em><strong>ACKS II Monstrous Manual</strong></em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Armorer</strong> (master, 75gp/month; journeyman, 20gp/month; apprentice, 10gp/month): Each month, a master armorer can make 40gp worth of weapons, armor, or shields. In addition to being hired for producing weapons and armor, armorers can maintain and fix the armor and weapons of one company of 120 infantry or 60 cavalry troops in the field. Master armorers can be assisted by up to two journeymen (20gp/month) and four apprentices (10gp/ month). Two journeymen and four apprentices will be available in the market for every master armorer. An armorer with two journeymen and four apprentices produces 160gp per month and can maintain one battalion of 480 infantry or 240 cavalry troops in the field. An army in the field without a sufficient number of armorers will require the disgruntled troops to do the work themselves. The loyalty of the army is reduced by 1 until an appropriate staff of armorers is hired.</p>\n<p><strong>Artisan</strong> (master, 75gp/month; journeyman, 20gp/month; apprentice, 10gp/month): Artisans are artists and crafters who make goods for sale. The type of goods created will vary by the artisan’s Art/Craft proficiency (p. XX). Artisans are divided into common, uncommon, and rare. Common artisans manufacture essential goods; examples include blacksmiths, brewers, candlemakers, clothmakers, potters, spinners, tailors, and tanners. Uncommon artisans manufacture non-essential but common goods; examples include bakers, confectioners, glassworkers, hornworkers, saddlers, and toymakers. Rare artisans manufacture exclusive or expensive goods; examples include bookbinders, gemcutters, jewelers, silversmiths, and shipwrights. Two journeymen and four apprentices will be available in the market for every master artisan. Artisans produce goods of their type at the same rate as armorers (above).</p>\n<p><strong>Designer’s Note:</strong> Grandmasters (NPCs with four ranks of an Art/Craft proficiency) never randomly appear in markets. They will only be present in settlements where they have been specifically placed by the Judge.</p>\n<p><strong>Artillerist</strong> (25gp/month): Leaders wishing to employ siege artillery such as ballistae, catapults, and trebuchets will need to employ artillerists. Each artillerist can oversee a battery of 3 – 5 pieces of artillery. See Siege Engineering proficiency (p. XX) and War Machines — Artillery (p. XX).</p>\n<p><strong>Copyist</strong> (1 gp/page): A copyist is a skilled scribe capable of accurately and cleanly copying a book’s text onto a fresh codex or scroll roll. Copyists charge 1gp per page. The actual codex or scroll roll must be purchased separately.</p>\n<p><strong>Creature Handler</strong> (domestic animals, 25gp/month; wild animals, 75gp/month; dire, giant or prehistoric animals 150gp/month; monstrosities or vermin, 250/gp month): A creature handler is a specialist trained to safely handle hunting or guard creatures. Under normal circumstances, a fully-trained creature of animal intelligence doesn’t require a trained specialist to handle it. However, battlefields offer an overwhelming palate of sounds and smells that can test the discipline of even the best-trained creature. In such circumstances, one creature handler is required per 6 hunting creatures or 20 guard creatures. A creature handler is not required for mounts or war mounts; these creatures are kept under control by their riders. Sapient creatures never require creature handlers. Some creature handlers are animal trainers themselves, while others rely on Beast Friendship or similar powers. In either case, their wages are comparable to those for animal trainers.</p>\n<p><strong>Engineer</strong> (250gp/month): Engineers are architects and mathematicians who supervise large construction projects. The number of engineers required for a construction project is based on its total gp value. A minimum of 1 engineer is needed, with an additional engineer per 100,000gp value of the project. For example, if a project is 60,000gp it will require 1 engineer, and if it is 200,000gp it will require 2 engineers. Human engineers usually handle large aboveground structures, while dwarves are usually hired for underground construction.</p>\n<p><strong>Healer</strong> (healer 1gp/day/patient or 25 gp/month, physicker 2gp/day/patient or 50 gp/month, chirurgeon 4gp/day/patient or 100 gp/month): Healers are trained to treat wounds and diagnose illnesses. Being treated by a healer requires clean, sanitary conditions and bed rest. A patient under treatment of any healer regains an extra 1d3 hit points per day.</p>\n<p>A normal healer can treat up to three patients per day, a physicker can treat up to four patients per day, and a chirurgeon can treat up to five patients per day. In addition, physickers can non-magically <em>neutralize poison</em>, <em>cure disease</em>, or <em>cure light injury</em> by spending one turn (10 minutes) and making a proficiency throw of 18+. Highly skilled chirurgeons can non-magically <em>neutralize poison</em>, <em>cure disease,</em> or <em>cure serious injury</em> with a proficiency throw of 14+. Either can use rare herbs to further improve some throws. See the Healing proficiency (p. XX) for more details.</p>\n<p><strong>Laborer</strong> (1sp/day or 2sp/day): Laborers can be hired in large numbers to work on construction projects. They can also be hired to carry loads or palanquins within civilized areas or on roads. Unskilled laborers have a cost and construction rate of 1sp per day. Skilled laborers have a cost and construction rate of 2sp per day. See <strong>Construction Projects</strong>, p. XX.</p>\n<p><strong>Lawyer</strong> (master practitioner, 100gp/month; licensed practitioner, 50gp/month; apprentice, 25gp/month): Lawyers can be hired to draft and execute contracts, testaments, and wills; to negotiate or handle business affairs; and most importantly to defend perpetrators of hijinks from criminal charges (p. XX). Two licensed practitioners and four apprentice practitioners will be available in the market for every master practitioner of the legal profession. (Other professionals are available in similar numbers.)</p>\n<p><strong>Mariner</strong> (rowers, 6gp/month; sailors 6gp/month; navigator 25gp/month; captain 100gp/month; master mariner 250gp/month): Rowers are skilled oarsmen who can row a boat or galley. Sailors are skilled seamen who can crew a sailing vessel. Navigators are skilled experts in charting course by the sun, moon, and stars. Captains and master mariners are masters of vessels.</p>\n<p>A navigator is required any time a ship will venture beyond sight of a coast. A captain or master mariner is required for any large ship with more than 3 crew. Captains are skilled like a sailor and have more intimate knowledge of the particular coasts they frequent. Master mariners are superior at maneuvering at sea but are otherwise identical to captains.</p>\n<p>All rowers and sailors, and most officers, are 0th level normal men, and are not armored; they will usually be armed with clubs, daggers, or short swords. About 25% of navigators, captains, and master mariners are leveled characters, often explorers or venturers of 1st, 3rd, or 4th level respectively. If so, they will be better equipped. Higher level mariners do not make themselves available for hire in the market but might be found on adventures.</p>\n<p><strong>Marshal</strong> (light infantry marshal, 30gp/month; bow, crossbow, or sling marshal 60gp/month; heavy infantry marshal, 60gp/month; light cavalry marshal 60gp/month; heavy cavalry marshal, 120gp/month; horse archer marshal, 120gp/month; cataphract marshal, 240gp/month): Marshals train soldiers in military discipline, physical fitness, and weapon drill. Training troops takes time, ranging from one month for light infantry to a full year for cataphract cavalry. The number of marshals required is based on the number of troops being trained. A minimum of 1 marshal is needed per 60 troops trained.</p>\n<p><strong>Mercenary Officer</strong> (lieutenant, 200gp/month; captain, 800gp/month; colonel, 3,000gp/month; general, 12,000gp/month): Mercenary officers can be hired to serve as the lieutenants of units or commanders or adjutants of divisions. Mercenary officers are usually (60%) fighters, but may sometimes be barbarians (10%), bards (10%), explorers (10%), or other classes (10%).</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Mercenary Officer Characteristics</strong></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Officer Title</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Level</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Cost/Month</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Leadership</strong>  <strong>Ability</strong></td>\n<td></td>\n<td><strong>Strategic</strong>  <strong>Ability</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Morale</strong>  <strong>Modifier</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Proficiencies</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Lieutenant</td>\n<td>4th</td>\n<td>200gp</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>+1</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td>Command, Military Strategy 1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Captain</td>\n<td>6th</td>\n<td>800gp</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td>Command, Military Strategy 2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Colonel</td>\n<td>8th</td>\n<td>3,000gp</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td>Command, Leadership, Military Strategy 2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>General</td>\n<td>10th</td>\n<td>12,000gp</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td>Command, Leadership, Military Strategy 3</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The base level, cost, and characteristics of mercenary officers are noted on the Mercenary Officer Characteristics table. The officer characteristics can vary based on the officer’s attributes. Roll 3d6 to determine the officer’s INT, WIL, and CHA scores. For colonels and generals, re-roll any one attribute and use the new roll if desired. An officer’s other proficiencies are at the Judge’s discretion. For more information on leadership ability, strategic ability, and morale modifier, see <strong>Armies</strong> (p. XX).</p>\n<p>Due to inherent disloyalty, all mercenary officers have a base loyalty of -2. Like all mercenaries, officers must make loyalty rolls each time they suffer a calamity. Mercenary officers also make loyalty rolls any time they are offered a higher wage by another employer. Mercenary officers who betray their leader will take with them any units assigned to their command! Wise leaders avoid mercenary officers where possible, preferring to entrust command of their units to adventuring comrades or trusted henchmen.</p>\n<p><strong>Quartermaster</strong> (40gp/month): A quartermaster is an experienced soldier who manages distribution of supplies and provisions to the troops of a unit. When troops are in the field and paying supply costs, at least one quartermaster must be available to the army’s leader per battalion of troops under his command. An army without a sufficient number of quartermasters will suffer from unfair distribution of supplies, cheating of provisions, and other indignities. The loyalty of the army is reduced by 1 until an appropriate staff of quartermasters is hired.</p>\n<p><strong>Ruffian</strong> (carouser, 7gp/month; footpad, 30gp/month; reciter, 30gp/month; slayer, 625gp/month; spy,625gp/month; thug 30gp/month): Ruffians are specialists in petty crime. Carousers are 0th level brawlers and hoodlums that populate inns and taverns. Footpads are 1st level thieves. Reciters are 1st level bards. Slayers are 4th level assassins. Spies are 4th level thieves. Thugs are 1st level assassins. Ruffians are hired on a monthly basis. They can be used as enforcers or muscle, or sent on various hijinks, such as assassinating, carousing, spying, stealing, or treasure-hunting. Ruffians will not go on adventures unless recruited as henchmen. Ruffians of 1st level or higher cost more than henchmen of their level because they must pay a tribute to their local crime boss. An adventurer who isthe local crime boss pays less (see p. XX). Ruffians are quite unreliable, and might stab the hiring character in the back (maybe literally) at any time.</p>\n<p><strong>Siege Engineer</strong> (50gp/month): Siege engineers are skilled in the construction and placement of temporary defensive works, artillery, and siege engines, with a construction rate of 6.6sp per day. They can also supervise others working on siege engineering projects of up to 25,000gp construction cost. They also can operate war machines of all types of artillery, battery rams, galleries, hoists, screws, and siege towers. See Siege Engineering proficiency (p. XX) and <strong>War Machines</strong> (p. XX).</p>\n<p><strong>Sage</strong> (500gp/month): Sages are scholars whose knowledge transcends the mundane and approaches the magical. Each sage specializes in a subject area, and can recall expert commentary or information relating to his specialty with a proficiency throw of 3+. Outside of his specialty, a sage can decipher occult runes, remember obscure facts, or identify a historic artifact part with a proficiency throw of 18+. Given one turn (10 minutes) of examination, he can recognize ordinary magical items or special components by examining them for one turn (10 minutes) with a proficiency throw of 11+. He can identify the exact properties of magic items with research as a 5th level mage.</p>\n<p><strong>Scout</strong> (pathfinder, 25gp/month; land surveyor, 25gp/month): Scouts are specialists in exploration, mapping, and land surveying. Pathfinders are 1st level explorers with the Pathfinder template and can be hired to search hexes for lairs. Land surveyors are 1st level explorers with the Cartographer template, and can be hired to assess the number of lairs in a hex. Both types of scout are hired on a monthly basis. Scouts will expect to be protected while on duty, either by their employer or by a number of mercenaries equal to the maximum number of lairs in the hex(es) they are assigned to explore. Scouts will attempt to evade any wandering monsters they encounter; they will not fight for their employer or enter lairs unless recruited as henchmen.</p>\n<p><strong>Translator</strong> (2sp/page): Translators are linguists who can translate text from one language to another. Translators charge 2sp per page. The translation cost is in addition to the cost of copying the book. The actual codex or scroll roll must be purchased separately.</p>\n<p><strong>Writer</strong> (Rank 1, 1gp/page; Rank 2, 2gp/page; Rank 3, 4 gp/page; Rank 4, 10 gp/page): Writers are literate specialists capable of authoring new books to spread knowledge. The rank of a writer determines the scope and complexity of the book he can author. For advanced rules on books, see <em><strong>Codex &amp; Scroll</strong></em><em>,</em> found in <em><strong>Axioms 14</strong></em>and <em><strong>Axioms Compendium 9 – 16</strong></em>.</p>\n<h3>Spellcasting Services</h3>\n<p>Arcane and divine casters are sometimes hired to cast a spell for an adventuring party. Most often these are divine casters asked to cast <em>cure disease</em>, <em>remove curse</em>, <em>restore life and limb</em>, and so on, but arcane casters can be sought out from time to time as well. The Spell Availability by Market table shows how many divine and arcane spellcasters capable of casting a given spell level can be found in any given market. Each spellcaster will be able to cast a spell of the given level once per day. The cost per casting is listed for each spell level as well. Just because a spellcaster can be found does not mean he will cast a spell for the adventurer — he must still be recruited through negotiation. Divine casters will never cast spells for adventurers of opposite alignment, and may charge double if the adventurers do not belong to their faith.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>Spell Availability by Market</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Spell Type and Level</td>\n<td><strong>Cost</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Class I</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Class II</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Class III</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Class IV</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Class V</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Class VI</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Divine-1st level</td>\n<td>5gp</td>\n<td>4d4x100</td>\n<td>4d10x10</td>\n<td>4d4x10</td>\n<td>6d10</td>\n<td>4d6</td>\n<td>2d4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Divine-2nd level</td>\n<td>10gp</td>\n<td>4d6x10</td>\n<td>12d6</td>\n<td>4d6</td>\n<td>4d4</td>\n<td>2d4</td>\n<td>1d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Divine-3rd level</td>\n<td>45gp</td>\n<td>8d6</td>\n<td>4d6</td>\n<td>2d6</td>\n<td>2d4</td>\n<td>1d6</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Divine-4th level</td>\n<td>185gp</td>\n<td>6d6</td>\n<td>2d6</td>\n<td>2d3</td>\n<td>1d3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Divine-5th level</td>\n<td>900gp</td>\n<td>4d4</td>\n<td>2d3</td>\n<td>1d4</td>\n<td>1d4-3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Divine-6th level</td>\n<td>3,600gp</td>\n<td>2d3</td>\n<td>1d3</td>\n<td>1d8-6</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Arcane-1st level</td>\n<td>5gp</td>\n<td>2d4x100</td>\n<td>2d10x10</td>\n<td>2d4x10</td>\n<td>3d10</td>\n<td>2d6</td>\n<td>1d4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Arcane-2nd level</td>\n<td>10gp</td>\n<td>2d6x10</td>\n<td>6d6</td>\n<td>2d6</td>\n<td>2d4</td>\n<td>1d4</td>\n<td>1d3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Arcane-3rd level</td>\n<td>45gp</td>\n<td>4d6</td>\n<td>2d6</td>\n<td>2d3</td>\n<td>1d4</td>\n<td>1d3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Arcane-4th level</td>\n<td>185gp</td>\n<td>3d6</td>\n<td>2d2</td>\n<td>1d3</td>\n<td>1d3-1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Arcane-5th level</td>\n<td>900gp</td>\n<td>2d4</td>\n<td>1d3</td>\n<td>1d2</td>\n<td>1d10-9</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Arcane-6th level</td>\n<td>3,600gp</td>\n<td>1d3</td>\n<td>1d3-1</td>\n<td>1d8-7</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>EXAMPLE: Quintus has been slain, while his companions (Balbus, Creven, and Marcus) have been infected with lycanthropy in a battle with wererats. The adventurers travel to the town of Siadanos (a Class IV market) to seek <em>restore life and limb</em> for Quintus and <em>cure disease</em> for the rest of the party. The Judge rolls on the Spell Availability by Market table to determine the availability of these spells.</p>\n<p><em>Cure disease</em> is a 3rd level divine spell, so the Judge rolls 2d4 to determine how many spell castings are available. Unfortunately he rolls a 2, so only two <em>cure disease</em> spells are available each day — not enough! <em>Restore life and limb</em> is a 5th level spell, so there are 1d4-3 available. The Judge rolls a 2, so there are none in Siadanos. The adventurers must decide whether to stay in town the two days necessary to get everyone cured of lycanthropy, or to press on immediately to try to find a caster who can raise Quintus.</p>\n<h6>Selling Spellcasting Services</h6>\n<p>While adventurers are usually consumers of spellcasting services rather than providers, from time to time, an industrious mage or other adventurer might decide to sell spellcasting services in the market. A spellcaster who dedicates a day to selling spells in a market should roll 1d6 for each spell he can cast in a day. On a roll of 6, he sells one casting of that spell and earns the fee for casting it. The maximum number of spells of a given level that can be sold in a day by a caster is 9 – (market class + spell level). Casters who reduce their price to attempt to sell more spells, or who regularly monopolize the spellcasting services, will inevitably find themselves targets for retribution by other spellcasters who do not like seeing their earnings reduced by price cuts and competition.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: Elaria is a 7th level mage able to cast 3 1st, 2 2nd, 2 3rd, and 1 4th spell per day. In theory she could earn (3 x 5) + (2 x 10) + (2 x 45) + (1 x 185) = 310gp per day selling spells. However, she will tend to sell only 1 in 6 spells per day, for an average income of 51gp 66sp per day. Over 30 days, she will earn an average of 1,550gp – which is the typical salary for a 5th level character.</p>\n<h6>Perpetual Spellcasting as a Service</h6>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Spell Level</td>\n<td>Upfront Fee</td>\n<td>Ongoing Monthly Fee</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1st level</td>\n<td>40gp</td>\n<td>1gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2nd level</td>\n<td>55gp</td>\n<td>2gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3rd level</td>\n<td>160gp</td>\n<td>5gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4th level</td>\n<td>440gp</td>\n<td>15gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5th level</td>\n<td>1,365gp</td>\n<td>40gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6th level</td>\n<td>4,515gp</td>\n<td>135gp</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>Sometimes adventurers might pay a spellcaster to cast a spell with a perpetual duration, such as <em>perpetual illumination.</em> Because casters are strictly limited in how many perpetual spells they can sustain, they charge both an upfront fee and an ongoing maintenance fee. Use the adjoining table for such transactions.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: A decadent noble wishes to illuminate his villa with 10 <em>perpetual illuminations</em> (3rd level). This costs him 1,600gp plus 50gp per month.</p>\n",

      "html": "<p>In addition to buying equipment, adventurers may also spend their money to hire various NPCs, known as <strong>hirelings</strong>,to assist them. There are three types of hirelings. <strong>Henchmen</strong> are NPC sidekicks, companions, and associates. Henchmen are typically very loyal and are willing to take reasonable risks; in particular, they are the only sort of hireling who will generally accompany an adventurer into a dungeon, lair, or ruin. <strong>Mercenaries</strong> are hired soldiers, and will guard, patrol, and otherwise serve in wilderness settings, but only as part of a larger force, not an adventuring party. <strong>Specialists</strong> are hired individuals who have a particular trade or who have special knowledge; they will rarely go on adventures at all unless it is directly related to their specialty. <strong>Followers</strong> are a special type of hireling that only becomes available to characters of 9th level or higher who have established a stronghold (see p. XX). Followers will undertake the same tasks as henchmen.</p>\n<p>While adventurers often wish to hire as many hirelings as they can afford, hirelings are not available in unlimited numbers. Indeed, in small villages or remote outposts, they may not be available at all. As with equipment, the amount available will be determined by the <strong>market class</strong> within which the adventurers are recruiting hirelings. The <strong>Hireling Availability by Market Class</strong> tables shows how many of each type of henchman, mercenary or specialist is available in each type of market, and at what wage. Some values will indicate a percentage chance; this is the chance of that level of hireling being present at all. One half of the hirelings (rounded up) become available within the first week the adventurers enter the market. One quarter (rounded down, minimum 1) become available during the second week. The remainder of the hirelings become available in the third week.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: Marcus is in Cyfaraun, a city of 20,000 (Class III market). He wants to hire a sage and some heavy infantry. There is a 65% chance of 1 sage being present; unfortunately, the Judge rolls a 98, and Marcus can’t find one available. His search for the heavy infantry goes better, as the Judge’s roll of 3d8 yields 22. Marcus finds 11 of these in his first week of searching, 5 more in his second week, and the remaining 6 in his third week.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Market</strong>  <strong>Class</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Cost Per Week</strong>  <strong>Per Hireling Type</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>I</td>\n<td>1d6+15gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>II</td>\n<td>1d10+10gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>III</td>\n<td>1d8+5gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>IV</td>\n<td>1d6+3gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>V</td>\n<td>1d6gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>VI</td>\n<td>1d3gp</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>PCs might sometimes find potential hirelings while on adventures. Otherwise, in order to find hirelings, the PCs must carouse in pubs, post notices of help wanted, hand out fliers, and seek out adventuring companies, mercenary brotherhoods, or professional guilds. These count as ancillary activities and cost money. Each week that the adventurers are in the market for hirelings, they must pay the fee listed on the adjoining table.

Mercenaries and specialists are typically hired for a flat monthly wage, which varies depending on the type of specialist or mercenary (see below).

A signing bonus worth one week’s pay for the hireling grants a +1 bonus; a month’s pay provides a +2 bonus, and a year’s pay provides a +3 bonus on the reaction roll. (A prospective employer with Bribing proficiency can use it when offering a signing bonus without risk of being charged with a crime.) The Judge might apply any other adjustments he feels are appropriate based on the circumstances.</p>\n<p><strong>Refuse and slander</strong> means that all further reaction rolls made towards that adventurer in the given town or region will be at a penalty of -1 due to unkind words said by the NPC to his fellows.

The treasure is therefore divided among 4 shares, with Norden, Elaria, and Caleför each getting 1,000gp and Drakima and Zelicus each getting 500gp.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Henchmen Monthly Wage</strong></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Class Level</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Monthly Wage (gp)</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Class Level</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Monthly Wage (gp)</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>3,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>25</td>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>7,250</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>50</td>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>12,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>100</td>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>32,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>200</td>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>50,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>400</td>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>135,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>800</td>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>350,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>1,600</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>A 1st level employer can only hire 0th level henchmen. A 2nd level employer can hire 0th or 1st level henchmen. A 3rd or 4th level employer can hire henchmen of up to 2nd level. A 5th or 6th level character can hire henchmen of up to 3rd level. A 7th level or higher employer can hire henchmen of up to 4th level, plus one henchman level per employer level above 7th. (Henchmen of greater than 4th level are not generally for hire on the market, but they can sometimes be found on adventures.) The foregoing notwithstanding, a domain ruler can hire henchmen of any level below his own.</p>\n<p>If there is no way for henchmen to directly know the level of the PC employer, they will use the employer’s appearance and living expenses as evidence for his level. Profligate adventurers might be able to fool a powerful henchman into working for them. However, if a henchman ever concludes he is more powerful than his employer, it is cause for an immediate Hireling Loyalty roll (q.v.) at a penalty of -1 per apparent difference in level.</p>\n<p>A player character may hire at most 4 henchmen, adjusted by the character’s Charisma bonus or penalty and certain class powers and proficiencies. Any attempts to hire more than this number of henchmen will cause the character to lose one of his existing henchmen. Mercenaries, specialists, and followers do not count towards a character’s maximum number of henchmen, since they do not require the same level of personal loyalty.</p>\n<p>It is not the intent of <em><strong>ACKS</strong></em>that henchmen be treated as “extra player characters.” A henchman is an ally and friend of the character, not an extension of the player. It is up to the Judge to decide the extent to which a player directly controls his character’s henchmen at any moment. Allowing the player to control his character’s henchmen is usually convenient, but that convenience does not reflect the reality of the game world, in which the henchman is an independent individual and the player character has limited ability to order them around. Therefore, in some circumstances, another player should be given control of henchmen, or the Judge should control them. In particular, some players will purposefully bring lots of henchmen on adventures in a deliberate attempt to “monopolize the spotlight.” This is both unrealistic within the game world, unfair to the other players, and detrimental to speed of play. In such circumstances, the Judge should allocate control of those henchmen to other players or direct them himself. Judges interested in how the designer handles this issue can watch the Grey Brotherhood Actual Play series on YouTube.</p>\n<p>Henchmen gain experience when they participate in an adventure; however, as they are under the command of a player character, only one-half of a share of XP is allocated to each henchman. See <strong>Earning Experience from Adventures</strong> for more information.</p>\n<p>Henchmen cannot themselves have henchmen unless they rule domains appropriate to their level. A domain is appropriate to their level if monthly domain income is at least equal to 50% of their wage. With Judge’s approval, mercantile income or army command can substitute for land. Income from a domain provided by his employer counts against a henchman’s monthly wage.</p>\n"

Mercenaries are not adventurers and attempting to use them as such usually ends in calamity. The Judge will determine what constitutes a military campaign and what constitutes an adventure depending on the overall circumstances. In general:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mercenaries will accompany adventurers on wilderness expeditions or sea journeys in settled territory and/or along established trade routes that pass through unsettled territory. They will not assist in searching unsettled territory around the trade route for monster lairs unless personally led, however.</li>\n<li>Mercenaries will accompany adventurers on wilderness expeditions or sea journeys into unsettled territory if on a campaign towards a known military or mercantile objective likely to yield substantial benefit for the mercenaries (“save your homeland” “get rich” etc.). They will not assist in searching the unsettled territory en route unless personally led, however.</li>\n<li>Mercenaries will accompany explorers (including NPC scout specialists) on wilderness expeditions into unsettled territory provided the explorers and mercenaries are under orders to evade all encounters, to a max of one platoon per explorer.</li>\n<li>Mercenaries will not accompany adventurers on wilderness expeditions or sea journeys into unsettled territory in other circumstances unless personally lead.</li>\n<li>Mercenaries will not accompany adventurers on dungeon delves, even if personally led. However, they will participate in sieges and assaults on dungeons if present in sufficient numbers to entirely blockade the dungeon or if personally led.</li>\n<li>Mercenaries count as personally lead if each platoon (30 infantry or 15 cavalry) has an adventurer or henchman of at least 3rd level serving as its lieutenant.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Mercenary Troop Type table below list the typical wages, equipment, and morale of mercenaries based on type. In addition to the weapons and armor noted for their troop type, all mercenaries have the following equipment: military tunic, cloak, pair of sandals, backpack, laborer’s tools, 4 stakes and mallet, mess kit, small tent, 2 wool blankets, and a waterskin. Cavalry mercenaries will also have a saddle, bridle, 2 saddlebags, and grooming kit. Missile-armed mercenaries will have 20 rounds of ammunition.</p>\n<p>The costs listed are the mercenaries’ wages only. The cost of armorers to make and repair troop armor and weapons, stablehands to groom horses, caravans to provide supplies while in the field, and other miscellaneous expenses are not included. Mercenaries in garrison need only be paid their wages, but mercenaries on campaign must be provided with supplies and will expect a share of military plunder in addition to wages. See <strong>Armies</strong> (p. XX) and <strong>Maneuvers</strong> (p. XX) for more troop types and advanced rules. Morale scores are for human troops.

      "html": "<p>Hundreds of different types of specialist exist in civilized realms; the list below is not exhaustive, and the Judge may create more kinds of specialists as needed using the rules in the <strong>Proficiencies</strong> chapter. Player characters with appropriate <strong>proficiencies</strong> may act as specialists if desired.</p>\n<p><strong>Alchemist</strong> (250gp/month): Alchemists are valuable specialists because they dedicate their expertise to creating potions and other concoctions. An alchemist can identify common alchemical substances by aroma and color in one round with a proficiency throw of 3+. He can attempt to identify which parts of a monster are special components with a proficiency throw of 7+. He can also attempt to extract toxin from poisonous plants. Each attempt requires one day and a proficiency throw of 12+ for fresh plants and 16+ for dried plants. If the throw succeeds, the alchemist extracts one dose of poison. If the throw fails, the alchemist accidentally spoils the plants. If the throw fails on an unmodified 1, the alchemist has accidentally exposed himself to the toxin and must immediately make a successful Poison save or suffers its effects. He can brew potions as if he were a 5th level mage. See <strong>Magic Research</strong> in Chapter 8 (p. XX).</p>\n<p><strong>Animal Trainer</strong> (domestic animals, 25gp/month; wild animals, 75gp/month; dire, giant or prehistoric animals 150gp/month; monstrosities or vermin, 250/gp month): Animal trainers knows how to tame and train animals of various sorts. The most common and least expensive animal trainers are those that can train domesticated animals such as dogs or horses. Less common and more expensive are animal trainers who can train wild animals, giant or prehistoric animals, or even bestial monstrosities. Basic rules for training animals can be found in the Proficiencies section (p. XX) and advanced rules can be found in other sourcebooks such as <em><strong>Lairs &amp; Encounters</strong></em> or the <em><strong>ACKS II Monstrous Manual</strong></em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Armorer</strong> (master, 75gp/month; journeyman, 20gp/month; apprentice, 10gp/month): Each month, a master armorer can make 40gp worth of weapons, armor, or shields. In addition to being hired for producing weapons and armor, armorers can maintain and fix the armor and weapons of one company of 120 infantry or 60 cavalry troops in the field. Master armorers can be assisted by up to two journeymen (20gp/month) and four apprentices (10gp/ month). Two journeymen and four apprentices will be available in the market for every master armorer. An armorer with two journeymen and four apprentices produces 160gp per month and can maintain one battalion of 480 infantry or 240 cavalry troops in the field. An army in the field without a sufficient number of armorers will require the disgruntled troops to do the work themselves. The loyalty of the army is reduced by 1 until an appropriate staff of armorers is hired.</p>\n<p><strong>Artisan</strong> (master, 75gp/month; journeyman, 20gp/month; apprentice, 10gp/month): Artisans are artists and crafters who make goods for sale. The type of goods created will vary by the artisan’s Art/Craft proficiency (p. XX). Artisans are divided into common, uncommon, and rare. Common artisans manufacture essential goods; examples include blacksmiths, brewers, candlemakers, clothmakers, potters, spinners, tailors, and tanners. Uncommon artisans manufacture non-essential but common goods; examples include bakers, confectioners, glassworkers, hornworkers, saddlers, and toymakers. Rare artisans manufacture exclusive or expensive goods; examples include bookbinders, gemcutters, jewelers, silversmiths, and shipwrights. Two journeymen and four apprentices will be available in the market for every master artisan. Artisans produce goods of their type at the same rate as armorers (above).</p>\n<p><strong>Designer’s Note:</strong> Grandmasters (NPCs with four ranks of an Art/Craft proficiency) never randomly appear in markets. They will only be present in settlements where they have been specifically placed by the Judge.</p>\n<p><strong>Artillerist</strong> (25gp/month): Leaders wishing to employ siege artillery such as ballistae, catapults, and trebuchets will need to employ artillerists. Each artillerist can oversee a battery of 3 – 5 pieces of artillery. See Siege Engineering proficiency (p. XX) and War Machines — Artillery (p. XX).</p>\n<p><strong>Copyist</strong> (1 gp/page): A copyist is a skilled scribe capable of accurately and cleanly copying a book’s text onto a fresh codex or scroll roll. Copyists charge 1gp per page. The actual codex or scroll roll must be purchased separately.</p>\n<p><strong>Creature Handler</strong> (domestic animals, 25gp/month; wild animals, 75gp/month; dire, giant or prehistoric animals 150gp/month; monstrosities or vermin, 250/gp month): A creature handler is a specialist trained to safely handle hunting or guard creatures. Under normal circumstances, a fully-trained creature of animal intelligence doesn’t require a trained specialist to handle it. However, battlefields offer an overwhelming palate of sounds and smells that can test the discipline of even the best-trained creature. In such circumstances, one creature handler is required per 6 hunting creatures or 20 guard creatures. A creature handler is not required for mounts or war mounts; these creatures are kept under control by their riders. Sapient creatures never require creature handlers. Some creature handlers are animal trainers themselves, while others rely on Beast Friendship or similar powers. In either case, their wages are comparable to those for animal trainers.</p>\n<p><strong>Engineer</strong> (250gp/month): Engineers are architects and mathematicians who supervise large construction projects. The number of engineers required for a construction project is based on its total gp value. A minimum of 1 engineer is needed, with an additional engineer per 100,000gp value of the project. For example, if a project is 60,000gp it will require 1 engineer, and if it is 200,000gp it will require 2 engineers. Human engineers usually handle large aboveground structures, while dwarves are usually hired for underground construction.</p>\n<p><strong>Healer</strong> (healer 1gp/day/patient or 25 gp/month, physicker 2gp/day/patient or 50 gp/month, chirurgeon 4gp/day/patient or 100 gp/month): Healers are trained to treat wounds and diagnose illnesses. Being treated by a healer requires clean, sanitary conditions and bed rest. A patient under treatment of any healer regains an extra 1d3 hit points per day.</p>\n<p>A normal healer can treat up to three patients per day, a physicker can treat up to four patients per day, and a chirurgeon can treat up to five patients per day. In addition, physickers can non-magically <em>neutralize poison</em>, <em>cure disease</em>, or <em>cure light injury</em> by spending one turn (10 minutes) and making a proficiency throw of 18+. Highly skilled chirurgeons can non-magically <em>neutralize poison</em>, <em>cure disease,</em> or <em>cure serious injury</em> with a proficiency throw of 14+. Either can use rare herbs to further improve some throws. See the Healing proficiency (p. XX) for more details.</p>\n<p><strong>Laborer</strong> (1sp/day or 2sp/day): Laborers can be hired in large numbers to work on construction projects. They can also be hired to carry loads or palanquins within civilized areas or on roads. Unskilled laborers have a cost and construction rate of 1sp per day. Skilled laborers have a cost and construction rate of 2sp per day. See <strong>Construction Projects</strong>, p. XX.</p>\n<p><strong>Lawyer</strong> (master practitioner, 100gp/month; licensed practitioner, 50gp/month; apprentice, 25gp/month): Lawyers can be hired to draft and execute contracts, testaments, and wills; to negotiate or handle business affairs; and most importantly to defend perpetrators of hijinks from criminal charges (p. XX). Two licensed practitioners and four apprentice practitioners will be available in the market for every master practitioner of the legal profession. (Other professionals are available in similar numbers.)</p>\n<p><strong>Mariner</strong> (rowers, 6gp/month; sailors 6gp/month; navigator 25gp/month; captain 100gp/month; master mariner 250gp/month): Rowers are skilled oarsmen who can row a boat or galley. Sailors are skilled seamen who can crew a sailing vessel. Navigators are skilled experts in charting course by the sun, moon, and stars. Captains and master mariners are masters of vessels.</p>\n<p>A navigator is required any time a ship will venture beyond sight of a coast. A captain or master mariner is required for any large ship with more than 3 crew. Captains are skilled like a sailor and have more intimate knowledge of the particular coasts they frequent. Master mariners are superior at maneuvering at sea but are otherwise identical to captains.</p>\n<p>All rowers and sailors, and most officers, are 0th level normal men, and are not armored; they will usually be armed with clubs, daggers, or short swords. About 25% of navigators, captains, and master mariners are leveled characters, often explorers or venturers of 1st, 3rd, or 4th level respectively. If so, they will be better equipped. Higher level mariners do not make themselves available for hire in the market but might be found on adventures.</p>\n<p><strong>Marshal</strong> (light infantry marshal, 30gp/month; bow, crossbow, or sling marshal 60gp/month; heavy infantry marshal, 60gp/month; light cavalry marshal 60gp/month; heavy cavalry marshal, 120gp/month; horse archer marshal, 120gp/month; cataphract marshal, 240gp/month): Marshals train soldiers in military discipline, physical fitness, and weapon drill. Training troops takes time, ranging from one month for light infantry to a full year for cataphract cavalry. The number of marshals required is based on the number of troops being trained. A minimum of 1 marshal is needed per 60 troops trained.</p>\n<p><strong>Mercenary Officer</strong> (lieutenant, 200gp/month; captain, 800gp/month; colonel, 3,000gp/month; general, 12,000gp/month): Mercenary officers can be hired to serve as the lieutenants of units or commanders or adjutants of divisions. Mercenary officers are usually (60%) fighters, but may sometimes be barbarians (10%), bards (10%), explorers (10%), or other classes (10%).</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Mercenary Officer Characteristics</strong></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Officer Title</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Level</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Cost/Month</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Leadership</strong>  <strong>Ability</strong></td>\n<td></td>\n<td><strong>Strategic</strong>  <strong>Ability</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Morale</strong>  <strong>Modifier</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Proficiencies</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Lieutenant</td>\n<td>4th</td>\n<td>200gp</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>+1</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td>Command, Military Strategy 1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Captain</td>\n<td>6th</td>\n<td>800gp</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td>Command, Military Strategy 2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Colonel</td>\n<td>8th</td>\n<td>3,000gp</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td>Command, Leadership, Military Strategy 2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>General</td>\n<td>10th</td>\n<td>12,000gp</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td>Command, Leadership, Military Strategy 3</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The base level, cost, and characteristics of mercenary officers are noted on the Mercenary Officer Characteristics table. The officer characteristics can vary based on the officer’s attributes. Roll 3d6 to determine the officer’s INT, WIL, and CHA scores. For colonels and generals, re-roll any one attribute and use the new roll if desired. An officer’s other proficiencies are at the Judge’s discretion. For more information on leadership ability, strategic ability, and morale modifier, see <strong>Armies</strong> (p. XX).</p>\n<p>Due to inherent disloyalty, all mercenary officers have a base loyalty of -2. Like all mercenaries, officers must make loyalty rolls each time they suffer a calamity. Mercenary officers also make loyalty rolls any time they are offered a higher wage by another employer. Mercenary officers who betray their leader will take with them any units assigned to their command! Wise leaders avoid mercenary officers where possible, preferring to entrust command of their units to adventuring comrades or trusted henchmen.</p>\n<p><strong>Quartermaster</strong> (40gp/month): A quartermaster is an experienced soldier who manages distribution of supplies and provisions to the troops of a unit. When troops are in the field and paying supply costs, at least one quartermaster must be available to the army’s leader per battalion of troops under his command. An army without a sufficient number of quartermasters will suffer from unfair distribution of supplies, cheating of provisions, and other indignities. The loyalty of the army is reduced by 1 until an appropriate staff of quartermasters is hired.</p>\n<p><strong>Ruffian</strong> (carouser, 7gp/month; footpad, 30gp/month; reciter, 30gp/month; slayer, 625gp/month; spy,625gp/month; thug 30gp/month): Ruffians are specialists in petty crime. Carousers are 0th level brawlers and hoodlums that populate inns and taverns. Footpads are 1st level thieves. Reciters are 1st level bards. Slayers are 4th level assassins. Spies are 4th level thieves. Thugs are 1st level assassins. Ruffians are hired on a monthly basis. They can be used as enforcers or muscle, or sent on various hijinks, such as assassinating, carousing, spying, stealing, or treasure-hunting. Ruffians will not go on adventures unless recruited as henchmen. Ruffians of 1st level or higher cost more than henchmen of their level because they must pay a tribute to their local crime boss. An adventurer who isthe local crime boss pays less (see p. XX). Ruffians are quite unreliable, and might stab the hiring character in the back (maybe literally) at any time.</p>\n<p><strong>Siege Engineer</strong> (50gp/month): Siege engineers are skilled in the construction and placement of temporary defensive works, artillery, and siege engines, with a construction rate of 6.6sp per day. They can also supervise others working on siege engineering projects of up to 25,000gp construction cost. They also can operate war machines of all types of artillery, battery rams, galleries, hoists, screws, and siege towers. See Siege Engineering proficiency (p. XX) and <strong>War Machines</strong> (p. XX).</p>\n<p><strong>Sage</strong> (500gp/month): Sages are scholars whose knowledge transcends the mundane and approaches the magical. Each sage specializes in a subject area, and can recall expert commentary or information relating to his specialty with a proficiency throw of 3+. Outside of his specialty, a sage can decipher occult runes, remember obscure facts, or identify a historic artifact part with a proficiency throw of 18+. Given one turn (10 minutes) of examination, he can recognize ordinary magical items or special components by examining them for one turn (10 minutes) with a proficiency throw of 11+. He can identify the exact properties of magic items with research as a 5th level mage.</p>\n<p><strong>Scout</strong> (pathfinder, 25gp/month; land surveyor, 25gp/month): Scouts are specialists in exploration, mapping, and land surveying. Pathfinders are 1st level explorers with the Pathfinder template and can be hired to search hexes for lairs. Land surveyors are 1st level explorers with the Cartographer template, and can be hired to assess the number of lairs in a hex. Both types of scout are hired on a monthly basis. Scouts will expect to be protected while on duty, either by their employer or by a number of mercenaries equal to the maximum number of lairs in the hex(es) they are assigned to explore. Scouts will attempt to evade any wandering monsters they encounter; they will not fight for their employer or enter lairs unless recruited as henchmen.</p>\n<p><strong>Translator</strong> (2sp/page): Translators are linguists who can translate text from one language to another. Translators charge 2sp per page. The translation cost is in addition to the cost of copying the book. The actual codex or scroll roll must be purchased separately.</p>\n<p><strong>Writer</strong> (Rank 1, 1gp/page; Rank 2, 2gp/page; Rank 3, 4 gp/page; Rank 4, 10 gp/page): Writers are literate specialists capable of authoring new books to spread knowledge. The rank of a writer determines the scope and complexity of the book he can author.

Most often these are divine casters asked to cast <em>cure disease</em>, <em>remove curse</em>, <em>restore life and limb</em>, and so on, but arcane casters can be sought out from time to time as well. The Spell Availability by Market table shows how many divine and arcane spellcasters capable of casting a given spell level can be found in any given market. Each spellcaster will be able to cast a spell of the given level once per day. The cost per casting is listed for each spell level as well. Just because a spellcaster can be found does not mean he will cast a spell for the adventurer — he must still be recruited through negotiation. Divine casters will never cast spells for adventurers of opposite alignment, and may charge double if the adventurers do not belong to their faith.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>Spell Availability by Market</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Spell Type and Level</td>\n<td><strong>Cost</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Class I</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Class II</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Class III</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Class IV</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Class V</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Class VI</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Divine-1st level</td>\n<td>5gp</td>\n<td>4d4x100</td>\n<td>4d10x10</td>\n<td>4d4x10</td>\n<td>6d10</td>\n<td>4d6</td>\n<td>2d4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Divine-2nd level</td>\n<td>10gp</td>\n<td>4d6x10</td>\n<td>12d6</td>\n<td>4d6</td>\n<td>4d4</td>\n<td>2d4</td>\n<td>1d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Divine-3rd level</td>\n<td>45gp</td>\n<td>8d6</td>\n<td>4d6</td>\n<td>2d6</td>\n<td>2d4</td>\n<td>1d6</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Divine-4th level</td>\n<td>185gp</td>\n<td>6d6</td>\n<td>2d6</td>\n<td>2d3</td>\n<td>1d3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Divine-5th level</td>\n<td>900gp</td>\n<td>4d4</td>\n<td>2d3</td>\n<td>1d4</td>\n<td>1d4-3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Divine-6th level</td>\n<td>3,600gp</td>\n<td>2d3</td>\n<td>1d3</td>\n<td>1d8-6</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Arcane-1st level</td>\n<td>5gp</td>\n<td>2d4x100</td>\n<td>2d10x10</td>\n<td>2d4x10</td>\n<td>3d10</td>\n<td>2d6</td>\n<td>1d4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Arcane-2nd level</td>\n<td>10gp</td>\n<td>2d6x10</td>\n<td>6d6</td>\n<td>2d6</td>\n<td>2d4</td>\n<td>1d4</td>\n<td>1d3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Arcane-3rd level</td>\n<td>45gp</td>\n<td>4d6</td>\n<td>2d6</td>\n<td>2d3</td>\n<td>1d4</td>\n<td>1d3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Arcane-4th level</td>\n<td>185gp</td>\n<td>3d6</td>\n<td>2d2</td>\n<td>1d3</td>\n<td>1d3-1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Arcane-5th level</td>\n<td>900gp</td>\n<td>2d4</td>\n<td>1d3</td>\n<td>1d2</td>\n<td>1d10-9</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Arcane-6th level</td>\n<td>3,600gp</td>\n<td>1d3</td>\n<td>1d3-1</td>\n<td>1d8-7</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>EXAMPLE: Quintus has been slain, while his companions (Balbus, Creven, and Marcus) have been infected with lycanthropy in a battle with wererats.

      "html": "<p>While adventurers are usually consumers of spellcasting services rather than providers, from time to time, an industrious mage or other adventurer might decide to sell spellcasting services in the market. A spellcaster who dedicates a day to selling spells in a market should roll 1d6 for each spell he can cast in a day. On a roll of 6, he sells one casting of that spell and earns the fee for casting it. The maximum number of spells of a given level that can be sold in a day by a caster is 9 – (market class + spell level). Casters who reduce their price to attempt to sell more spells, or who regularly monopolize the spellcasting services, will inevitably find themselves targets for retribution by other spellcasters who do not like seeing their earnings reduced by price cuts and competition.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: Elaria is a 7th level mage able to cast 3 1st, 2 2nd, 2 3rd, and 1 4th spell per day. In theory she could earn (3 x 5) + (2 x 10) + (2 x 45) + (1 x 185) = 310gp per day selling spells. However, she will tend to sell only 1 in 6 spells per day, for an average income of 51gp 66sp per day. Over 30 days, she will earn an average of 1,550gp – which is the typical salary for a 5th level character.</p>\n"

  "rawMarkdown": "## Hirelings, Henchmen, Mercenaries, and Specialists\n\nIn addition to buying equipment, adventurers may also spend their money to hire various NPCs, known as **hirelings**,to assist them. There are three types of hirelings. **Henchmen** are NPC sidekicks, companions, and associates. Henchmen are typically very loyal and are willing to take reasonable risks; in particular, they are the only sort of hireling who will generally accompany an adventurer into a dungeon, lair, or ruin. **Mercenaries** are hired soldiers, and will guard, patrol, and otherwise serve in wilderness settings, but only as part of a larger force, not an adventuring party. **Specialists** are hired individuals who have a particular trade or who have special knowledge; they will rarely go on adventures at all unless it is directly related to their specialty. **Followers** are a special type of hireling that only becomes available to characters of 9th level or higher who have established a stronghold (see p. XX). Followers will undertake the same tasks as henchmen.\n\nWhile adventurers often wish to hire as many hirelings as they can afford, hirelings are not available in unlimited numbers. Indeed, in small villages or remote outposts, they may not be available at all. As with equipment, the amount available will be determined by the **market class** within which the adventurers are recruiting hirelings. The **Hireling Availability by Market Class** tables shows how many of each type of henchman, mercenary or specialist is available in each type of market, and at what wage. Some values will indicate a percentage chance; this is the chance of that level of hireling being present at all. One half of the hirelings (rounded up) become available within the first week the adventurers enter the market. One quarter (rounded down, minimum 1) become available during the second week. The remainder of the hirelings become available in the third week.\n\nEXAMPLE: Marcus is in Cyfaraun, a city of 20,000 (Class III market). He wants to hire a sage and some heavy infantry. There is a 65% chance of 1 sage being present; unfortunately, the Judge rolls a 98, and Marcus can’t find one available. His search for the heavy infantry goes better, as the Judge’s roll of 3d8 yields 22. Marcus finds 11 of these in his first week of searching, 5 more in his second week, and the remaining 6 in his third week.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Market**  **Class** | **Cost Per Week**  **Per Hireling Type** |\n| I | 1d6+15gp |\n| II | 1d10+10gp |\n| III | 1d8+5gp |\n| IV | 1d6+3gp |\n| V | 1d6gp |\n| VI | 1d3gp |\n\nPCs might sometimes find potential hirelings while on adventures. Otherwise, in order to find hirelings, the PCs must carouse in pubs, post notices of help wanted, hand out fliers, and seek out adventuring companies, mercenary brotherhoods, or professional guilds. These count as ancillary activities and cost money. Each week that the adventurers are in the market for hirelings, they must pay the fee listed on the adjoining table. This fee is per specific type of hireling, i.e. each type of mercenary or specialist.\n\n### Recruiting Hirelings\n\nHirelings are recruited through negotiation. The Judge plays the roles of the NPCs the PCs attempt to hire. Henchmen are typically hired for a half-share of treasure found and a monthly wage for food, lodging and expenses (based on level, see below). Mercenaries and specialists are typically hired for a flat monthly wage, which varies depending on the type of specialist or mercenary (see below). Mercenaries will expect spoils of war after battles and sieges. Henchmen, mercenaries, and specialists will have equipment appropriate to their profession, class, or level. Adventurers may provide additional equipment to their hirelings.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Reaction to Hiring Offer** | |\n| **Adjusted Die Roll** | **Result** |\n| 2- | Refuse and slander |\n| 3 – 5 | Refuse |\n| 6 – 8 | Try Again |\n| 9 – 11 | Accept |\n| 12+ | Accept with élan |\n\nAfter the offers are made, the Judge will make a **reaction roll** of 2d6 on the Reaction to Hiring Offer table to decide the potential hireling’s reactions, modified by the prospective employer’s Charisma bonus or penalty. If proficient, the prospective employer can use Diplomacy, Intimidation, Mystic Aura, and/or Seduction to persuade the hireling to join. The prospective employer can also offer a signing bonus. A signing bonus worth one week’s pay for the hireling grants a +1 bonus; a month’s pay provides a +2 bonus, and a year’s pay provides a +3 bonus on the reaction roll. (A prospective employer with Bribing proficiency can use it when offering a signing bonus without risk of being charged with a crime.) The Judge might apply any other adjustments he feels are appropriate based on the circumstances.\n\n**Refuse and slander** means that all further reaction rolls made towards that adventurer in the given town or region will be at a penalty of -1 due to unkind words said by the NPC to his fellows. If the adventurer tries again in a different town, the penalty does not apply. **Refuse** simply means the NPC declines the offer.\n\nIf a **Try again** result is rolled, the potential hireling is reluctant, and needs more convincing; the adventurer must “sweeten the deal” in order to get an additional roll, such as by offering more pay, a magic item, or other appealing suggestion. If the adventurer makes no better offer, treat **Try again** as a **Refusal** result.\n\n**Accept** means that the NPC has agreed to become the character’s hireling for the stated terms. **Accept with élan** means the offer is accepted with very good spirit, and the hireling gains a +1 bonus to his loyalty score.\n\n###### Recruiting After a Failed Attempt\n\nSometimes an adventurer will attempt to recruit a hireling that just rejected the employment offer of one or more other adventurer(s) in the same party. The following rules apply:\n\n* Each subsequent attempt suffers a cumulative -1 penalty, representing the hireling’s growing contempt for the “desperate” party attempting to hire him.\n* If any of the attempts ever result in a reaction of refuse and slander, no further attempts can be made to recruit that hireling by any adventurer in the party.\n\nFrom time to time, enterprising adventurers might try to pretend “not to know each other” in order to avoid the penalties for making multiple attempts to recruit a hireling into the same party. Nothing precludes this, but if and when the hireling discovers he has unknowingly hired into comradeship with someone who he had previously rejected, it counts as a calamity (see p. XX).\n\n###### Transferring Employment of a Hireling\n\nSometimes a hireling might be recruited into a party by one adventurer (e.g. one with high CHA) with the intent that that the hireling will actually be employed by another adventurer in the party. At other times a hireling might be recruited into a party by one adventurer and then later transferred to a different adventurer’s employment, perhaps due to the death or incapacity of the original employer, perhaps so that the original employer can hire a new henchman, etc.\n\nWhen a hireling is transferred from the employ of one adventurer to another in the same party, the hireling’s loyalty and morale scores are immediately recalculated based on the Charisma, proficiencies, and class powers of the hireling’s new employer. The transfer then counts as a calamity (p. XX).\n\n###### Hireling Availability by Market Class\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Hireling (Mercenary) Availability by Market Class | | | | | | | |\n| Mercenary | **Class I** | **Class II** | **Class III** | **Class IV** | **Class V** | **Class VI** | **Wage** |\n| Light Infantry | 4d100 | 5d20 | 5d10 | 3d4 | 1d6 | 1d2 | By race |\n| Heavy Infantry | 2d100 | 5d10 | 3d8 | 1d8 | 1d3 | 1 (85%) | By race |\n| Slinger | 8d20 | 4d10 | 2d10 | 1d6 | 1d2 | 1 (70%) | By race |\n| Bowman | 8d20 | 4d10 | 2d10 | 1d6 | 1d2 | 1 (70%) | By race |\n| Crossbowman | 8d20 | 4d10 | 2d10 | 1d6 | 1d2 | 1 (70%) | By race |\n| Composite Bowman/Longbowman\\* | 4d20 | 2d10 | 1d10 | 1d3 | 1 | 1 (33%) | By race |\n| Light Cavalry | 4d20 | 2d10 | 1d10 | 1d3 | 1 | 1 (33%) | By race |\n| Mounted Crossbowman | 3d20 | 4d4 | 2d4 | 1d2 | 1 (75%) | 1 (25%) | By race |\n| Horse Archers | 3d20 | 4d4 | 2d4 | 1d3 | 1 (70%) | 1 (23%) | By race |\n| Medium Cavalry | 3d20 | 4d4 | 2d4 | 1d2 | 1 (70%) | 1 (23%) | By race |\n| Heavy Cavalry | 4d10 | 1d10 | 1d6 | 1d2 (50%) | 1 (50%) | 1 (15%) | By race |\n| Cataphract Cavalry | 3d10 | 1d8 | 1d4 | 1d2 (33%) | 1 (40%) | 1 (10%) | By race |\n| Camel Archers\\*\\* | 4d20 | 2d10 | 1d10 | 1d3 | 1 | 1 (33%) | By race |\n| Camel Lancers\\*\\* | 3d20 | 4d4 | 2d4 | 1d2 | 1 (70%) | 1 (23%) | By race |\n| War Elephants | 1d10 | 1 (70%) | 1 (40%) | 1 (7%) | 1 (5%) | -

Loyalty is a hireling’s fidelity to his employer. A hireling can have a high morale but low loyalty — a treacherous berserker, for example, might have +4 morale (he would never flee in combat) but -4 loyalty (he’d betray his employer). A hireling can also have a high loyalty and low morale. For instance, a cowardly accountant might be impossible to bribe and committed to lifetime service to his employer, but he’d flee at the merest sight of a beastman.\n\n###### Loyalty\n\nLoyalty can range from -4 to +4. Most henchmen, mercenaries, specialists, and followers begin with a loyalty of 0. Bladedancer and crusader followers begin with a loyalty score of +4. Mercenary officers (but not troops) begin with a loyalty of -2. Ruffians have a loyalty of -2 unless they are members of their employer’s syndicate (see p. XX). Creatures forced into servitude begin with loyalty scores of -4. The loyalty score is then modified by the employer’s Charisma modifier. Add +1 if the employer has the Blood of Ancient Kings class power and add +1 if the hireling rolled “Accept with élan” on his Reaction to Hiring roll. Over time, a hireling’s loyalty score will change based on how he fares in the adventurer’s employ:\n\n* +1 permanent increase each time the employer rolls Fanatic Loyalty on a Hireling Loyalty roll.\n* -1 permanent decrease each time the employer rolls Grudging Loyalty on a Hireling Loyalty roll.\n* +1 permanent increase each time the hireling gains a level while in the employer’s service.\n* -1 permanent decrease each time the hireling suffers a calamity while in the employer’s service.\n* -1 decrease each time the hireling suffers a permanent wound from being critically wounded until cured or compensated.\n* -2 decrease each time the hireling suffers a permanent wound from being grievously wounded until cured or compensated.\n* -3 decrease each time the hireling suffers a permanent wound from being mortally wounded until cured or compensated.\n* -1 permanent decrease each time the hireling suffers a moderate side effect from tampering with mortality.\n* -2 permanent decrease each time the hireling suffers a major side effect from tampering with mortality.\n* -2 permanent decrease each time other hirelings in the adventurer’s employ are incapacitated or killed and are not magically restored even though funds were available to do so.\n\nA calamity occurs anytime a hireling has to go without rations or wages; suffers an enervation, curse, or magical disease; is reduced to 0 hp or less; or other similarly dire outcomes (Judge’s discretion).\n\nA hireling must make a roll on the Hireling Loyalty table each time he suffers a calamity and each time he advances in experience level. The Judge secretly rolls 2d6 and adds the hireling’s loyalty score to decide how the henchman responds to the recent events. The Judge might apply adjustments to this roll, probably no more than ±2, depending on the circumstances.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Hireling Loyalty** | |\n| **Adjusted Die Roll (2d6)** | **Result** |\n| 2- | Hostility |\n| 3 – 5 | Resignation |\n| 6 – 8 | Grudging Loyalty |\n| 9 – 11 | Loyalty |\n| 12+ | Fanatic Loyalty |\n\n**Hostility** means that the hireling immediately leaves the service of the employer, and will consider him a rival and enemy in the future. The hireling can never be attracted to the character’s employ again. A result of **Resignation** means the hireling immediately leaves the character’s employment, but he bears no especially ill will to his former employer, and could be recruited to work for the character again in the future.\n\n**Grudging Loyalty** means the hireling is reluctant to continue in the employer’s service, but sees no better options. The hireling’s loyalty score is reduced by 1. **Loyalty** means that hireling will continue in the character’s service with enthusiasm. **Fanatic Loyalty** means hireling has become a dedicated and sworn servant of the character. His loyalty score increases by +1.\n\nRegardless of modifiers, an unmodified roll of 2 is never better than Resignation, and an unmodified result of 12 is never worse than Loyalty.\n\n###### Morale\n\nMorale can range from -4 to +4. Hirelings begin with a Morale based on their specialty, class, and level. Most specialists have a morale score of -2, but rowers and sailors have morale of -1; navigators, captains, and scouts have morale 0; and marshals, master mariners, and mercenary officers have morale +1. Mercenaries have a morale score of -1 to +2. Henchmen have a morale score equivalent to a mercenary with similar equipment; if capable of casting spells, their minimum morale score is 0. Bladedancer and crusader followers have a Morale score of +4. Additional modifiers can apply to Morale score, including:\n\n* A permanent +1 bonus to morale score when a 0th-level hireling gains his first experience level (or additional HD)\n* A permanent +1 bonus to morale score when a hireling gains his 5th experience level or HD.\n* A permanent +1 bonus to morale score for conscripts levied from domains with Steadfast or Stalwart morale (see p. XX).\n* A permanent -1 penalty to morale score for conscripts levied from domains with Apathetic or Demoralized domain morale.\n* A temporary -3 to +3 modifier to morale Score when personally lead by a character with a Charisma bonus or penalty.\n* A temporary +2 bonus to morale score when personally led by a character with Command proficiency.\n* A temporary +1 bonus to morale score when personally led by a character of 5th level or higher in appropriate circumstances.\n* A temporary +1 bonus to morale score when subject toInspire Courage*, holy blessing,* and other effects.\n\nThe combined total of a character’s modifier to his hireling’s morale scores is referred to as his **morale modifier** and plays a major role in warfare (p. XX).\n\nFrom time to time, the Judge might require a hireling to roll on the Hireling Obedience table. A roll might be required if the hireling is ordered to go on an expedition into unexplored wilderness hexes; ordered to enter a dungeon the party has not entered before; asked to personally perform a notably dangerous task; asked to work overtime in an urban settlement; or other circumstances. No roll should be required for routine tasks such as travel in civilized areas, standing guard, etc. The Judge secretly rolls 2d6 and adds the hireling’s morale score to decide how the hireling responds.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Hireling Obedience | |\n| Adjusted Die Roll (2d6) | **Result** |\n| 2- | Refuses |\n| 3 – 5 | Begrudging |\n| 6+ | Compliant |\n\n**Refuses** means thatthe hireling is unwilling to follow orders. If the employer insists, permanently reduce the hireling’s loyalty score by 1, then roll again on Hireling Obedience. **Begrudging** means the hireling carries out the task with the minimum of enthusiasm. He complains, sighs, bitches, and moans. If begrudging a journey or dungeon, he suffers a -1 penalty to any loyalty rolls for that arise due to the adventure. If begrudging a specific task in a dungeon, he suffers a -1 penalty to proficiency throws on the task and ceases the activity after one turn (10 minutes) unless ordered to continue. If asked to work overtime in a settlement, his productivity is reduced by one proficiency rank or one class level, whichever is worse, and he ceases the activity after a work-week unless ordered to continue. **Compliant** meansthat the hireling carries out the task to the best of his ability. Hireling Obedience rolls do not automatically fail on an unmodified 2, so a +4 or higher modifier is sufficient to guarantee orders are carried out.\n\nAt his discretion, the Judge might apply situational modifiers to the roll. Examples of possible modifiers are listed below.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Situation | Modifier |\n| +2 | Employer personally doing task, dungeon, journey, or work alongside hireling |\n| +1 | Adventurer other than employer doing task, dungeon, journey, or work alongside hireling |\n| +0 | Other hirelings doing task, dungeon, journey, or work alongside hireling |\n| -1 | Hireling doing task, dungeon, journey, or work alone |\n| +2 | Task is customary for hireling’s profession or class (e.g. search for traps for thief, bash door for fighter) |\n| +0 | Task exposes hireling to small risk similar to what others in party face |\n| -1 | One or more henchmen were incapacitated, killed, or captured in the last month or most recent adventure |\n| -1 | Task exposes hireling to more risk than what others in party face |\n| -2 | Task exposes hireling to great risk of life and limb that others in party are not exposed to |\n| -5 | Task exposes hireling to extraordinary risk of incapacitation, death, capture, etc. |\n| -5 | Hireling is a mercenary ordered to undertake adventuring activities outside the norm |\n\nHirelings might also have to make morale rolls when they lose a substantial amount of hp in combat or the party as a whole suffers severe casualties or shocks. See p. XX for more details.\n\n### Henchmen\n\nHenchmen should be rolled up with attributes, classes, hit points, and equipment, just like player characters. Henchmen are typically paid a monthly fee for food, lodging and expenses as well as a half-share of any treasure discovered on an adventure. A henchmen’s monthly fee is based on his level, as noted on the Henchmen Monthly Wage table, below. A henchman who is given a domain to rule as a vassal does not need to be paid a wage if the domain income is equal to or greater than his wage. However, he will thereafter only adventure with his lord when called to council (p. XX).\n\nEXAMPLE: An adventuring party has just recovered 4,000gp in treasure. The party consists of Norden (a player character), Elaria (a PC), Caleför (a PC), and Caleför’s two henchmen, Drakima and Zelicus. Each adventurer gets a full share of treasure, while each henchman gets a half-share. The treasure is therefore divided among 4 shares, with Norden, Elaria, and Caleför each getting 1,000gp and Drakima and Zelicus each getting 500gp.\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Henchmen Monthly Wage** | | | |\n| **Class Level** | **Monthly Wage (gp)** | **Class Level** | **Monthly Wage (gp)** |\n| 0 | 12 | 8 | 3,000 |\n| 1 | 25 | 9 | 7,250 |\n| 2 | 50 | 10 | 12,000 |\n| 3 | 100 | 11 | 32,000 |\n| 4 | 200 | 12 | 50,000 |\n| 5 | 400 | 13 | 135,000 |\n| 6 | 800 | 14 | 350,000 |\n| 7 | 1,600 |  |  |\n\nA 1st level employer can only hire 0th level henchmen. A 2nd level employer can hire 0th or 1st level henchmen. A 3rd or 4th level employer can hire henchmen of up to 2nd level. A 5th or 6th level character can hire henchmen of up to 3rd level. A 7th level or higher employer can hire henchmen of up to 4th level, plus one henchman level per employer level above 7th. (Henchmen of greater than 4th level are not generally for hire on the market, but they can sometimes be found on adventures.) The foregoing notwithstanding, a domain ruler can hire henchmen of any level below his own.\n\nIf there is no way for henchmen to directly know the level of the PC employer, they will use the employer’s appearance and living expenses as evidence for his level. Profligate adventurers might be able to fool a powerful henchman into working for them. However, if a henchman ever concludes he is more powerful than his employer, it is cause for an immediate Hireling Loyalty roll (q.v.) at a penalty of -1 per apparent difference in level.\n\nA player character may hire at most 4 henchmen, adjusted by the character’s Charisma bonus or penalty and certain class powers and proficiencies. Any attempts to hire more than this number of henchmen will cause the character to lose one of his existing henchmen. Mercenaries, specialists, and followers do not count towards a character’s maximum number of henchmen, since they do not require the same level of personal loyalty.\n\nIt is not the intent of ***ACKS***that henchmen be treated as “extra player characters.” A henchman is an ally and friend of the character, not an extension of the player. It is up to the Judge to decide the extent to which a player directly controls his character’s henchmen at any moment. Allowing the player to control his character’s henchmen is usually convenient, but that convenience does not reflect the reality of the game world, in which the henchman is an independent individual and the player character has limited ability to order them around. Therefore, in some circumstances, another player should be given control of henchmen, or the Judge should control them. In particular, some players will purposefully bring lots of henchmen on adventures in a deliberate attempt to “monopolize the spotlight.” This is both unrealistic within the game world, unfair to the other players, and detrimental to speed of play. In such circumstances, the Judge should allocate control of those henchmen to other players or direct them himself. Judges interested in how the designer handles this issue can watch the Grey Brotherhood Actual Play series on YouTube.\n\nHenchmen gain experience when they participate in an adventure; however, as they are under the command of a player character, only one-half of a share of XP is allocated to each henchman. See **Earning Experience from Adventures** for more information.\n\nHenchmen cannot themselves have henchmen unless they rule domains appropriate to their level. A domain is appropriate to their level if monthly domain income is at least equal to 50% of their wage. With Judge’s approval, mercantile income or army command can substitute for land. Income from a domain provided by his employer counts against a henchman’s monthly wage.\n\n### Mercenaries\n\nMercenaries are generally hired to garrison a stronghold or wage war in military campaigns. Mercenaries are not adventurers and attempting to use them as such usually ends in calamity. The Judge will determine what constitutes a military campaign and what constitutes an adventure depending on the overall circumstances. In general:\n\n* Mercenaries will accompany adventurers on wilderness expeditions or sea journeys in settled territory and/or along established trade routes that pass through unsettled territory. They will not assist in searching unsettled territory around the trade route for monster lairs unless personally led, however.\n* Mercenaries will accompany adventurers on wilderness expeditions or sea journeys into unsettled territory if on a campaign towards a known military or mercantile objective likely to yield substantial benefit for the mercenaries (“save your homeland” “get rich” etc.). They will not assist in searching the unsettled territory en route unless personally led, however.\n* Mercenaries will accompany explorers (including NPC scout specialists) on wilderness expeditions into unsettled territory provided the explorers and mercenaries are under orders to evade all encounters, to a max of one platoon per explorer.\n* Mercenaries will not accompany adventurers on wilderness expeditions or sea journeys into unsettled territory in other circumstances unless personally lead.\n* Mercenaries will not accompany adventurers on dungeon delves, even if personally led. However, they will participate in sieges and assaults on dungeons if present in sufficient numbers to entirely blockade the dungeon or if personally led.\n* Mercenaries count as personally lead if each platoon (30 infantry or 15 cavalry) has an adventurer or henchman of at least 3rd level serving as its lieutenant.\n\nThe Mercenary Troop Type table below list the typical wages, equipment, and morale of mercenaries based on type. In addition to the weapons and armor noted for their troop type, all mercenaries have the following equipment: military tunic, cloak, pair of sandals, backpack, laborer’s tools, 4 stakes and mallet, mess kit, small tent, 2 wool blankets, and a waterskin. Cavalry mercenaries will also have a saddle, bridle, 2 saddlebags, and grooming kit. Missile-armed mercenaries will have 20 rounds of ammunition.\n\nThe costs listed are the mercenaries’ wages only. The cost of armorers to make and repair troop armor and weapons, stablehands to groom horses, caravans to provide supplies while in the field, and other miscellaneous expenses are not included. Mercenaries in garrison need only be paid their wages, but mercenaries on campaign must be provided with supplies and will expect a share of military plunder in addition to wages. See **Armies** (p. XX) and **Maneuvers** (p. XX) for more troop types and advanced rules. Morale scores are for human troops. Demi-human morale will be 1 point higher.\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Gp Wage per Month | | | | | Morale |\n| Mercenary Troop Type | *Man* | *Dwarf* | *Elf* | *Goblin* | *Orc* |\n| Peasants (spear) | 3 | - | - | - | - | -2 |\n| Light Infantry (3 javelins, short sword, shield, leather armor) | 6 | - | 21 | 3 | 6 | -1 |\n| Heavy Infantry (spear, short sword, shield, banded plate armor) | 12 | 27 | 30 | - | 12 | 0 |\n| Slingers (sling, short sword, shield) | 6 | - | - | 3 | - | -1 |\n| Bowmen (short bow, short sword, leather armor) | 9 | - | 27 | 3 | 9 | -1 |\n| Composite Bowmen (composite bow, short sword, leather) | 15 | - | - | - | - | 0 |\n| Crossbowmen (arbalest, short sword, shield, chain mail) | 18 | 27 | - | - | 6 | 0 |\n| Longbowmen (long bow, short sword, chain mail) | 18 | - | 40 | - | - | 0 |\n| Light Cavalry (3 javelins, sword, shield, scale armor, light warhorse) | 30 | - | 50 | - | - | +1 |\n| Mounted Crossbowmen (crossbow, short sword, plate armor, mule) | - | 55 | - | - | - | +1 |\n| Horse Archers (composite bow, scimitar, leather armor, light warhorse) | 45 | - | 90 | - | - | +1 |\n| Medium Cavalry (lance, sword, shield, lamellar, scale-barded medium warhorse) | 45 | - | - | - | - | +1 |\n| Heavy Cavalry (lance, sword, shield, plate armor, chain-barded medium warhorse) | 60 | - | - | - | - | +2 |\n| Cataphract Cavalry (comp. bow, lance, sword, plate, lamellar-barded medium warhorse) | 75 |  | 160 |  |  | +2 |\n| Camel Archers (composite bow, scimitar, leather armor, camel) | 30 | - | - | - | - | +1 |\n| Camel Lancers (composite bow, lance, scimitar, chain mail, camel) | 45 | - | - | - | - | +2 |\n| War Elephants\\*\\* (lamellar barding, howdah, 6 x comp. bows, lances, scale armor) | 360 | - | - | - | - | +2 |\n| Wolf Riders (spear, scimitar, shield, leather armor, dire wolf) | - | - | - | 45 | - | 0 |\n| Boar Riders (lance, scimitar, shield, leather armor, giant boar) | - | - | - | - | 85 | +1 |\n| \\*War elephants are hired by elephant and wages include 6 troops in howdah. |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n\n### Specialists\n\nHundreds of different types of specialist exist in civilized realms; the list below is not exhaustive, and the Judge may create more kinds of specialists as needed using the rules in the **Proficiencies** chapter. Player characters with appropriate **proficiencies** may act as specialists if desired.\n\n**Alchemist** (250gp/month): Alchemists are valuable specialists because they dedicate their expertise to creating potions and other concoctions. An alchemist can identify common alchemical substances by aroma and color in one round with a proficiency throw of 3+. He can attempt to identify which parts of a monster are special components with a proficiency throw of 7+. He can also attempt to extract toxin from poisonous plants. Each attempt requires one day and a proficiency throw of 12+ for fresh plants and 16+ for dried plants. If the throw succeeds, the alchemist extracts one dose of poison. If the throw fails, the alchemist accidentally spoils the plants. If the throw fails on an unmodified 1, the alchemist has accidentally exposed himself to the toxin and must immediately make a successful Poison save or suffers its effects. He can brew potions as if he were a 5th level mage. See **Magic Research** in Chapter 8 (p. XX).\n\n**Animal Trainer** (domestic animals, 25gp/month; wild animals, 75gp/month; dire, giant or prehistoric animals 150gp/month; monstrosities or vermin, 250/gp month): Animal trainers knows how to tame and train animals of various sorts. The most common and least expensive animal trainers are those that can train domesticated animals such as dogs or horses. Less common and more expensive are animal trainers who can train wild animals, giant or prehistoric animals, or even bestial monstrosities. Basic rules for training animals can be found in the Proficiencies section (p. XX) and advanced rules can be found in other sourcebooks such as ***Lairs & Encounters*** or the ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual***.\n\n**Armorer** (master, 75gp/month; journeyman, 20gp/month; apprentice, 10gp/month): Each month, a master armorer can make 40gp worth of weapons, armor, or shields. In addition to being hired for producing weapons and armor, armorers can maintain and fix the armor and weapons of one company of 120 infantry or 60 cavalry troops in the field. Master armorers can be assisted by up to two journeymen (20gp/month) and four apprentices (10gp/ month). Two journeymen and four apprentices will be available in the market for every master armorer. An armorer with two journeymen and four apprentices produces 160gp per month and can maintain one battalion of 480 infantry or 240 cavalry troops in the field. An army in the field without a sufficient number of armorers will require the disgruntled troops to do the work themselves. The loyalty of the army is reduced by 1 until an appropriate staff of armorers is hired.\n\n**Artisan** (master, 75gp/month; journeyman, 20gp/month; apprentice, 10gp/month): Artisans are artists and crafters who make goods for sale. The type of goods created will vary by the artisan’s Art/Craft proficiency (p. XX). Artisans are divided into common, uncommon, and rare. Common artisans manufacture essential goods; examples include blacksmiths, brewers, candlemakers, clothmakers, potters, spinners, tailors, and tanners. Uncommon artisans manufacture non-essential but common goods; examples include bakers, confectioners, glassworkers, hornworkers, saddlers, and toymakers. Rare artisans manufacture exclusive or expensive goods; examples include bookbinders, gemcutters, jewelers, silversmiths, and shipwrights. Two journeymen and four apprentices will be available in the market for every master artisan. Artisans produce goods of their type at the same rate as armorers (above).\n\n**Designer’s Note:** Grandmasters (NPCs with four ranks of an Art/Craft proficiency) never randomly appear in markets. They will only be present in settlements where they have been specifically placed by the Judge.\n\n**Artillerist** (25gp/month): Leaders wishing to employ siege artillery such as ballistae, catapults, and trebuchets will need to employ artillerists. Each artillerist can oversee a battery of 3 – 5 pieces of artillery. See Siege Engineering proficiency (p. XX) and War Machines — Artillery (p. XX).\n\n**Copyist** (1 gp/page): A copyist is a skilled scribe capable of accurately and cleanly copying a book’s text onto a fresh codex or scroll roll. Copyists charge 1gp per page. The actual codex or scroll roll must be purchased separately.\n\n**Creature Handler** (domestic animals, 25gp/month; wild animals, 75gp/month; dire, giant or prehistoric animals 150gp/month; monstrosities or vermin, 250/gp month): A creature handler is a specialist trained to safely handle hunting or guard creatures. Under normal circumstances, a fully-trained creature of animal intelligence doesn’t require a trained specialist to handle it. However, battlefields offer an overwhelming palate of sounds and smells that can test the discipline of even the best-trained creature. In such circumstances, one creature handler is required per 6 hunting creatures or 20 guard creatures. A creature handler is not required for mounts or war mounts; these creatures are kept under control by their riders. Sapient creatures never require creature handlers. Some creature handlers are animal trainers themselves, while others rely on Beast Friendship or similar powers. In either case, their wages are comparable to those for animal trainers.\n\n**Engineer** (250gp/month): Engineers are architects and mathematicians who supervise large construction projects. The number of engineers required for a construction project is based on its total gp value. A minimum of 1 engineer is needed, with an additional engineer per 100,000gp value of the project. For example, if a project is 60,000gp it will require 1 engineer, and if it is 200,000gp it will require 2 engineers. Human engineers usually handle large aboveground structures, while dwarves are usually hired for underground construction.\n\n**Healer** (healer 1gp/day/patient or 25 gp/month, physicker 2gp/day/patient or 50 gp/month, chirurgeon 4gp/day/patient or 100 gp/month): Healers are trained to treat wounds and diagnose illnesses. Being treated by a healer requires clean, sanitary conditions and bed rest. A patient under treatment of any healer regains an extra 1d3 hit points per day.\n\nA normal healer can treat up to three patients per day, a physicker can treat up to four patients per day, and a chirurgeon can treat up to five patients per day. In addition, physickers can non-magically *neutralize poison*, *cure disease*, or *cure light injury* by spending one turn (10 minutes) and making a proficiency throw of 18+. Highly skilled chirurgeons can non-magically *neutralize poison*, *cure disease,* or *cure serious injury* with a proficiency throw of 14+. Either can use rare herbs to further improve some throws. See the Healing proficiency (p. XX) for more details.\n\n**Laborer** (1sp/day or 2sp/day): Laborers can be hired in large numbers to work on construction projects. They can also be hired to carry loads or palanquins within civilized areas or on roads. Unskilled laborers have a cost and construction rate of 1sp per day. Skilled laborers have a cost and construction rate of 2sp per day. See **Construction Projects**, p. XX.\n\n**Lawyer** (master practitioner, 100gp/month; licensed practitioner, 50gp/month; apprentice, 25gp/month): Lawyers can be hired to draft and execute contracts, testaments, and wills; to negotiate or handle business affairs; and most importantly to defend perpetrators of hijinks from criminal charges (p. XX). Two licensed practitioners and four apprentice practitioners will be available in the market for every master practitioner of the legal profession. (Other professionals are available in similar numbers.)\n\n**Mariner** (rowers, 6gp/month; sailors 6gp/month; navigator 25gp/month; captain 100gp/month; master mariner 250gp/month): Rowers are skilled oarsmen who can row a boat or galley. Sailors are skilled seamen who can crew a sailing vessel. Navigators are skilled experts in charting course by the sun, moon, and stars. Captains and master mariners are masters of vessels.\n\nA navigator is required any time a ship will venture beyond sight of a coast. A captain or master mariner is required for any large ship with more than 3 crew. Captains are skilled like a sailor and have more intimate knowledge of the particular coasts they frequent. Master mariners are superior at maneuvering at sea but are otherwise identical to captains.\n\nAll rowers and sailors, and most officers, are 0th level normal men, and are not armored; they will usually be armed with clubs, daggers, or short swords. About 25% of navigators, captains, and master mariners are leveled characters, often explorers or venturers of 1st, 3rd, or 4th level respectively. If so, they will be better equipped. Higher level mariners do not make themselves available for hire in the market but might be found on adventures.\n\n**Marshal** (light infantry marshal, 30gp/month; bow, crossbow, or sling marshal 60gp/month; heavy infantry marshal, 60gp/month; light cavalry marshal 60gp/month; heavy cavalry marshal, 120gp/month; horse archer marshal, 120gp/month; cataphract marshal, 240gp/month): Marshals train soldiers in military discipline, physical fitness, and weapon drill. Training troops takes time, ranging from one month for light infantry to a full year for cataphract cavalry. The number of marshals required is based on the number of troops being trained. A minimum of 1 marshal is needed per 60 troops trained.\n\n**Mercenary Officer** (lieutenant, 200gp/month; captain, 800gp/month; colonel, 3,000gp/month; general, 12,000gp/month): Mercenary officers can be hired to serve as the lieutenants of units or commanders or adjutants of divisions. Mercenary officers are usually (60%) fighters, but may sometimes be barbarians (10%), bards (10%), explorers (10%), or other classes (10%).\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Mercenary Officer Characteristics** | | | |  | | | |\n| **Officer Title** | **Level** | **Cost/Month** | **Leadership**  **Ability** | | **Strategic**  **Ability** | **Morale**  **Modifier** | **Proficiencies** |\n| Lieutenant | 4th | 200gp | 4 | | +1 | +2 | Command, Military Strategy 1 |\n| Captain | 6th | 800gp | 4 | | +2 | +3 | Command, Military Strategy 2 |\n| Colonel | 8th | 3,000gp | 5 | | +2 | +3 | Command, Leadership, Military Strategy 2 |\n| General | 10th | 12,000gp | 5 | | +3 | +3 | Command, Leadership, Military Strategy 3 |\n\nThe base level, cost, and characteristics of mercenary officers are noted on the Mercenary Officer Characteristics table. The officer characteristics can vary based on the officer’s attributes. Roll 3d6 to determine the officer’s INT, WIL, and CHA scores. For colonels and generals, re-roll any one attribute and use the new roll if desired. An officer’s other proficiencies are at the Judge’s discretion. For more information on leadership ability, strategic ability, and morale modifier, see **Armies** (p. XX).\n\nDue to inherent disloyalty, all mercenary officers have a base loyalty of -2. Like all mercenaries, officers must make loyalty rolls each time they suffer a calamity. Mercenary officers also make loyalty rolls any time they are offered a higher wage by another employer. Mercenary officers who betray their leader will take with them any units assigned to their command! Wise leaders avoid mercenary officers where possible, preferring to entrust command of their units to adventuring comrades or trusted henchmen.\n\n**Quartermaster** (40gp/month): A quartermaster is an experienced soldier who manages distribution of supplies and provisions to the troops of a unit. When troops are in the field and paying supply costs, at least one quartermaster must be available to the army’s leader per battalion of troops under his command. An army without a sufficient number of quartermasters will suffer from unfair distribution of supplies, cheating of provisions, and other indignities. The loyalty of the army is reduced by 1 until an appropriate staff of quartermasters is hired.\n\n**Ruffian** (carouser, 7gp/month; footpad, 30gp/month; reciter, 30gp/month; slayer, 625gp/month; spy,625gp/month; thug 30gp/month): Ruffians are specialists in petty crime. Carousers are 0th level brawlers and hoodlums that populate inns and taverns. Footpads are 1st level thieves. Reciters are 1st level bards. Slayers are 4th level assassins. Spies are 4th level thieves. Thugs are 1st level assassins. Ruffians are hired on a monthly basis. They can be used as enforcers or muscle, or sent on various hijinks, such as assassinating, carousing, spying, stealing, or treasure-hunting. Ruffians will not go on adventures unless recruited as henchmen. Ruffians of 1st level or higher cost more than henchmen of their level because they must pay a tribute to their local crime boss. An adventurer who isthe local crime boss pays less (see p. XX). Ruffians are quite unreliable, and might stab the hiring character in the back (maybe literally) at any time.\n\n**Siege Engineer** (50gp/month): Siege engineers are skilled in the construction and placement of temporary defensive works, artillery, and siege engines, with a construction rate of 6.6sp per day. They can also supervise others working on siege engineering projects of up to 25,000gp construction cost. They also can operate war machines of all types of artillery, battery rams, galleries, hoists, screws, and siege towers. See Siege Engineering proficiency (p. XX) and **War Machines** (p. XX).\n\n**Sage** (500gp/month): Sages are scholars whose knowledge transcends the mundane and approaches the magical. Each sage specializes in a subject area, and can recall expert commentary or information relating to his specialty with a proficiency throw of 3+. Outside of his specialty, a sage can decipher occult runes, remember obscure facts, or identify a historic artifact part with a proficiency throw of 18+. Given one turn (10 minutes) of examination, he can recognize ordinary magical items or special components by examining them for one turn (10 minutes) with a proficiency throw of 11+. He can identify the exact properties of magic items with research as a 5th level mage.\n\n**Scout** (pathfinder, 25gp/month; land surveyor, 25gp/month): Scouts are specialists in exploration, mapping, and land surveying. Pathfinders are 1st level explorers with the Pathfinder template and can be hired to search hexes for lairs. Land surveyors are 1st level explorers with the Cartographer template, and can be hired to assess the number of lairs in a hex. Both types of scout are hired on a monthly basis. Scouts will expect to be protected while on duty, either by their employer or by a number of mercenaries equal to the maximum number of lairs in the hex(es) they are assigned to explore. Scouts will attempt to evade any wandering monsters they encounter; they will not fight for their employer or enter lairs unless recruited as henchmen.\n\n**Translator** (2sp/page): Translators are linguists who can translate text from one language to another. Translators charge 2sp per page. The translation cost is in addition to the cost of copying the book. The actual codex or scroll roll must be purchased separately.\n\n**Writer** (Rank 1, 1gp/page; Rank 2, 2gp/page; Rank 3, 4 gp/page; Rank 4, 10 gp/page): Writers are literate specialists capable of authoring new books to spread knowledge. The rank of a writer determines the scope and complexity of the book he can author. For advanced rules on books, see ***Codex & Scroll****,* found in ***Axioms 14***and ***Axioms Compendium 9 – 16***.\n\n### Spellcasting Services\n\nArcane and divine casters are sometimes hired to cast a spell for an adventuring party. Most often these are divine casters asked to cast *cure disease*, *remove curse*, *restore life and limb*, and so on, but arcane casters can be sought out from time to time as well. The Spell Availability by Market table shows how many divine and arcane spellcasters capable of casting a given spell level can be found in any given market. Each spellcaster will be able to cast a spell of the given level once per day. The cost per casting is listed for each spell level as well. Just because a spellcaster can be found does not mean he will cast a spell for the adventurer — he must still be recruited through negotiation. Divine casters will never cast spells for adventurers of opposite alignment, and may charge double if the adventurers do not belong to their faith.\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Spell Availability by Market | | | | | | |\n| Spell Type and Level | **Cost** | **Class I** | **Class II** | **Class III** | **Class IV** | **Class V** | **Class VI** |\n| Divine-1st level | 5gp | 4d4x100 | 4d10x10 | 4d4x10 | 6d10 | 4d6 | 2d4 |\n| Divine-2nd level | 10gp | 4d6x10 | 12d6 | 4d6 | 4d4 | 2d4 | 1d6 |\n| Divine-3rd level | 45gp | 8d6 | 4d6 | 2d6 | 2d4 | 1d6 | - |\n| Divine-4th level | 185gp | 6d6 | 2d6 | 2d3 | 1d3 | - | - |\n| Divine-5th level | 900gp | 4d4 | 2d3 | 1d4 | 1d4-3 | - | - |\n| Divine-6th level | 3,600gp | 2d3 | 1d3 | 1d8-6 | - | - | - |\n| Arcane-1st level | 5gp | 2d4x100 | 2d10x10 | 2d4x10 | 3d10 | 2d6 | 1d4 |\n| Arcane-2nd level | 10gp | 2d6x10 | 6d6 | 2d6 | 2d4 | 1d4 | 1d3 |\n| Arcane-3rd level | 45gp | 4d6 | 2d6 | 2d3 | 1d4 | 1d3 | - |\n| Arcane-4th level | 185gp | 3d6 | 2d2 | 1d3 | 1d3-1 | - | - |\n| Arcane-5th level | 900gp | 2d4 | 1d3 | 1d2 | 1d10-9 | - | - |\n| Arcane-6th level | 3,600gp | 1d3 | 1d3-1 | 1d8-7 | - | - | - |\n\nEXAMPLE: Quintus has been slain, while his companions (Balbus, Creven, and Marcus) have been infected with lycanthropy in a battle with wererats. The adventurers travel to the town of Siadanos (a Class IV market) to seek *restore life and limb* for Quintus and *cure disease* for the rest of the party. The Judge rolls on the Spell Availability by Market table to determine the availability of these spells.\n\n*Cure disease* is a 3rd level divine spell, so the Judge rolls 2d4 to determine how many spell castings are available. Unfortunately he rolls a 2, so only two *cure disease* spells are available each day — not enough! *Restore life and limb* is a 5th level spell, so there are 1d4-3 available. The Judge rolls a 2, so there are none in Siadanos. The adventurers must decide whether to stay in town the two days necessary to get everyone cured of lycanthropy, or to press on immediately to try to find a caster who can raise Quintus.\n\n###### Selling Spellcasting Services\n\nWhile adventurers are usually consumers of spellcasting services rather than providers, from time to time, an industrious mage or other adventurer might decide to sell spellcasting services in the market. A spellcaster who dedicates a day to selling spells in a market should roll 1d6 for each spell he can cast in a day. On a roll of 6, he sells one casting of that spell and earns the fee for casting it. The maximum number of spells of a given level that can be sold in a day by a caster is 9 – (market class + spell level). Casters who reduce their price to attempt to sell more spells, or who regularly monopolize the spellcasting services, will inevitably find themselves targets for retribution by other spellcasters who do not like seeing their earnings reduced by price cuts and competition.\n\nEXAMPLE: Elaria is a 7th level mage able to cast 3 1st, 2 2nd, 2 3rd, and 1 4th spell per day. In theory she could earn (3 x 5) + (2 x 10) + (2 x 45) + (1 x 185) = 310gp per day selling spells. However, she will tend to sell only 1 in 6 spells per day, for an average income of 51gp 66sp per day. Over 30 days, she will earn an average of 1,550gp – which is the typical salary for a 5th level character.\n\n###### Perpetual Spellcasting as a Service\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Spell Level | Upfront Fee | Ongoing Monthly Fee |\n| 1st level | 40gp | 1gp |\n| 2nd level | 55gp | 2gp |\n| 3rd level | 160gp | 5gp |\n| 4th level | 440gp | 15gp |\n| 5th level | 1,365gp | 40gp |\n| 6th level | 4,515gp | 135gp |\n\nSometimes adventurers might pay a spellcaster to cast a spell with a perpetual duration, such as *perpetual illumination.* Because casters are strictly limited in how many perpetual spells they can sustain, they charge both an upfront fee and an ongoing maintenance fee. Use the adjoining table for such transactions.\n\nEXAMPLE: A decadent noble wishes to illuminate his villa with 10 *perpetual illuminations* (3rd level). This costs him 1,600gp plus 50gp per month.\n"
