This is a perfectly sized army for war-mongering barons, earls, counts, and dukes, such as most adventuring player characters. However, high-level <em><strong>ACKS</strong></em>campaigns can feature far larger armies, with battles between empires fielding tens of thousands of troops on each side. Other campaigns might feature clashes between war bands of a few hundred troops.</p>\n<p>When armies are very small or very large, the company-scale unit and division structure outlined above will not suffice. If the army has 600 or fewer troops, organize its troops into <strong>platoon-scale</strong> units.

If the rump is less than half a unit, ignore the rump (assume it represents reserves, trainees, or sick troops). If the rump is at least half a unit, organize it as one or more understrength units. With large-scale units, you can sometimes reduce the “rump” by rounding the sizes to the nearest interval of 500, e.g. 500 infantry per battalion or 2,000 infantry per brigade, again assuming any excess is reserves, sick troops, and so on.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE #1: Balbus, a 14th level cleric, has become Theocrat of Aura. He raises a vast army for a crusade against Kemesh. His army consists of 6,000 heavy cavalry; 18,000 heavy infantry; 18,000 light infantry, and 18,000 bowmen, for a total of 60,000 troops. Since the army is greater than 12,000 troops, he organizes it into brigade-sized units. He divides the troops into 6 brigades of 960 heavy cavalry each; 9 brigades of 1,920 heavy infantry each; 9 brigades of 1,920 light infantry each; and 9 brigades of 1,920 bowmen each. The “rump” of excess troops is ignored. He has a total of 33 brigade-sized units in his army. Balbus has CHA 14 (+1) and Leadership proficiency. His army may have up to (4+1+1) 6 divisions. He decides to organize his army as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>1st division with six brigades of heavy cavalry</li>\n<li>2nd division with four brigades of heavy infantry and two brigades of bowmen</li>\n<li>3rd division with four brigades of heavy infantry and two brigades of bowmen</li>\n<li>4th division with four brigades of light infantry and two brigades of bowmen</li>\n<li>5th division with four brigades of light infantry and two brigades of bowmen</li>\n<li>6th division with one brigade of heavy infantry, one brigade of light infantry, and one brigade of bowmen</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Because the army is organized into brigade-sized units, any unit lieutenants will need to be at least 9th level, and each division commander will need to be at least 10th level.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE #2: An orc village is going to war. The village consists of 1 orc chief, 6 sub-chieftains, 30 champions (1+1 Hit Dice each), and 180 orcs. The orc chief organizes his army into seven platoons. Six platoons consist of 30 orcs each. The seventh platoon consists of 30 champions. The orc chief has a leadership ability of 4, so he may have up to four divisions in his army. He organizes his divisions as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>1st division with one platoon of orc champions, commanded by the orc chief</li>\n<li>2nd division with two platoons of orcs, commanded by an orc sub-chief</li>\n<li>3rd division with two platoons of orcs, commanded by an orc sub-chief</li>\n<li>4th division with two platoons of orcs, commanded by an orc sub-chief</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The remaining three orc sub-chiefs are distributed as lieutenants.</p>\n",
