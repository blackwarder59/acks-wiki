Such an outcome is rare unless the army’s leader has a very high morale modifier. In most cases, a battle will end from voluntary withdrawal or rout long before this occurs.\n\n### Voluntary Withdrawal\n\nA battle immediately ends if either of the armies **voluntarily withdraws**. Armies which suffer a morale collapse are very vulnerable to pursuit, so a wise leader will conduct a voluntary withdrawal before this occurs.\n\n### Morale Collapse\n\nArmies do not, as a rule, fight to the last man (or elf, or orc). Instead they suffer a gradual loss of morale, becoming increasingly disordered as casualties mount, until eventually the army is swept away in a rout. These effects are simulated with **morale rolls**.\n\nDuring the Morale Phase, every unit in an army must make a morale roll if:\n\n* One or more units in the army were destroyed or disordered during the preceding combat round; and\n* The total number of units destroyed in the battle thus far plus the number of units that are currently disordered is equal to or greater than the army’s **break point.** An army’s break point is always 1/3 of the army’s starting number of units, rounded up.\n\nEXAMPLE: Marcus began the battle with an army of 12 units.
