All mariners and marines must be provided with food and water by their employer in addition to wages. Mariners and marines do not have Swimming proficiency and usually drown if they fall overboard or their ship is sunk.</p>\n<h6>Mariners</h6>\n<p><strong>Rowers and Sailors:</strong> Rowers are skilled oarsmen with Seafaring (rowing) proficiency. They can handle oars and paddles, operate steering oars, and maintain vessels in working order. Sailors are able seamen with Seafaring (sailing) proficiency. They can hitch ropes, trim sails, operate steering oars, and maintain vessels in working order. Rowers and sailors cost 6gp per month.</p>\n<p>Because their skills are valuable to every marine realm, sailors and rowers on vessels are reluctant to fight against human or demi-human opponents because they know they will just be captured rather than killed. If forced to fight, they do so with AC 0, Speed 120’, HD 1-1, #AT 1 11+, Dmg by weapon, ML -1. They have weapon proficiency in club, hand axe, net, and staff. They have no proficiency in weapon-and-shield, or dual weapon styles, nor in other weapons or any armor.</p>\n<p>Conscripts or militia called up from a domain can be trained as rowers and sailors; training time and cost are as per light infantry (p. XX). If conscripts, militia, or other unproficient characters attempt to row or sail vessels, they do so poorly. The vessel’s speed is reduced as if it were missing crew, with each unproficient character counting as 0.5 missing crew. Time spent under oar or under sail counts as training time.</p>\n<p><strong>Navigator:</strong> Navigators are skilled experts in charting course by the sun, moon, stars, wind patterns, and water currents. To qualify as a navigator a character must have one rank of Seafaring proficiency and either the Pathfinding class power or the Navigation proficiency. Rowers and sailors treat each day they spend out of sight of land without a navigator on board as a morale calamity. Navigators cost 25gp per month. 25% of navigators are 1st level characters.</p>\n<p><strong>Captain</strong>: Captains are skilled mariners who know how to command vessels. To qualify as a captain, a character must have two ranks of Seafaring proficiency. If a vessel lacks a captain, it suffers a -4 penalty on any Seafaring proficiency throws.

Master mariners treat points of sail as one step more favorable, and grant their vessel a +4 bonus on Seafaring proficiency throws and ramming attack throws. Master mariners cost 250gp per month. 25% of master mariners are 4th level characters.</p>\n<p>Roll 1d10 to determine the class of leveled mariners: 1 fighter, 2 – 5 explorer, 6 – 9 venturer, 10 Judge’s choice of any class. Mariners of higher than 4th level do not make themselves available for hire in the market but might be found on adventures.</p>\n<p>The number of mariners required to fully crew a vessel depends on the type of vessel. Navigators, captains, and master mariners count as sailors (not rowers!) for purposes of crewing a vessel. The number of mariners available depends on the size of the market where they are recruited. If the number available is insufficient to crew his vessel(s), a domain or realm leader (or representative thereof) can recruit mariners from throughout the domain or realm to serve in their navies. The Naval Specialist Availability by Realm Size table shows how many of each type of specialist is available in each size of realm and how long they take to arrive. As with mercenaries, the listed realms are of minimum population for their type and can be scaled up for larger realms. The specialists arrive at the same rate as mercenaries, and as with finding and hiring mercenaries in a realm, there is a gp cost associated with finding and hiring specialists throughout the realm. The fee is identical to that for recruiting mercenaries from a realm (p.

Any light infantry, slingers, bowmen, heavy infantry, long bowmen, and/or crossbowmen can serve as marines, but not mounted troops. The weight of the weapons and armor carried by the marines counts against the cargo capacity of the vessel they serve on.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: Phaedra hires 75 heavy infantry with banded plate armor (5 st each) and polearms (1 st each) to serve as marines on her 5-rower galley. The marines’ equipment counts as 75 x (5 + 1) = 450 stone of cargo.</p>\n<p>Up to 10% of mercenaries recruited from a coastal realm or port city might be <strong>elite marines</strong> (Judge’s discretion). Elite marines are able to fight as well as serve as either sailors or rowers. Elite marines cost 3gp per month more than ordinary mercenaries of their type.</p>\n<p>The exact composition of a marine contingent can vary from realm to realm or even vessel to vessel. The Auran Empire favors a mix of one-third bowmen and two-thirds heavy infantry armed with polearms, while the Syrnasos islanders favor a mix of one-half bowmen and one-half light infantry with javelins. The Jutlanders field elite marines that serve as sailors or rowers but fight as heavy infantry.</p>\n<p>Remember that if a vessel is equipped with artillery pieces or war machines, it will need crew for each machine. If the machine is an artillery piece, its crew should include an artillerist or the artillery piece will suffer penalties to its rate of fire and accuracy (p. XX). War machine crew count against the total number of marines that can be carried. The weight of war machines counts against the cargo capacity of the vessel, as does any ammunition carried.</p>\n<p>Additional marines can be carried below deck as cargo. Each additional marine carried in this manner takes up 50 st of cargo space. Marines below deck cannot attack or be attacked until they move to the top deck. The top deck will usually not have room for more than the standard compliment of marines to fight at once.</p>\n<h6>Mariner and Marine Morale and Loyalty</h6>\n<p>Like all hirelings, mariners and marines have <strong>morale scores</strong> and <strong>loyalty scores.</strong> Morale score is the crew’s confidence in battle. Marine morale is based on their training and equipment (p. XX). Sailor and rower morale scores are -1, or -2 if untrained. Navigators, captains, and master mariners have morale scores of 0, or +1 if leveled. Morale rolls (but not the base score) are modified by the employer’s <strong>morale modifier</strong> (p. XX) when he leads them in battle. Loyalty is the crew’s fidelity to their employer. Mariners have a base loyalty score of 0. Marines have a base loyalty score of -2, or 0 if elite marines. Loyalty scores are permanently modified by the leader’s Charisma modifier.</p>\n<p>The same rules for morale and loyalty apply as they do to hirelings retained by adventurers (p. xx), except as noted hereafter. When fielding navies, morale rolls and loyalty scores are tracked and rolled on a unit-by-unit base for events that occur to the unit.</p>\n<p>Morale rolls for marines and mariners are made in combat when they suffer casualties (p. XX and p. XX). Loyalty rolls are made any time the vessel suffers a <strong>calamity</strong>. A calamity includes fleeing from a battle, suffering 25% or greater casualties, being out of supply for a week, going without pay for a month, or being out of sight of land without a navigator. If the crew are suffering from more than one calamity at once, there is a -2 penalty on the die roll per calamity after the first.</p>\n<p>When making loyalty rolls, a result of <strong>hostility</strong> means that the crew mutinies immediately. A result of <strong>resignation</strong> means that the crew demands that the vessel head for the nearest friendly port. If the adventurers or captain agree to do so, the crew will continue to serve as crew until they reach the port, then disembark and resign. If the adventurers or captain refuse to do so, the crew will mutiny in 1d6 days.</p>\n",

A calamity includes fleeing from a battle, suffering 25% or greater casualties, being out of supply for a week, going without pay for a month, or being out of sight of land without a navigator. If the crew are suffering from more than one calamity at once, there is a -2 penalty on the die roll per calamity after the first.\n\nWhen making loyalty rolls, a result of **hostility** means that the crew mutinies immediately.
