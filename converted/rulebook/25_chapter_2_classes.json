The core human classes described in these rules are the <strong>fighter</strong>, <strong>explorer</strong>, <strong>thief</strong>, <strong>mage</strong>, <strong>crusader</strong>,and <strong>venturer</strong>. Each of the core classes specializes in a particular aspect of gameplay — combat, wilderness exploration, dungeon delving, arcane casting, divine casting, and mercantile ventures. The core classes are presented in order of complexity, in order to aid you in learning the game. It is much easier for a new player to be a fighter than a venturer, for instance.
