An assaultseeks to capture the stronghold through force of arms. Assaults are decisive, but expensive in manpower and material. Even successful assaults against battered strongholds will come at a high price in blood. Assaults are resolved in a series of <strong>assault turns</strong> following the procedure below. The system should be familiar, as it is similar to that described in Chapter 11, <strong>Running a Battle</strong>.</p>\n<h3>Gathering the Units</h3>\n<p>Make a counter or marker for each unit in each participating division in each army. Group the units into their divisions and be sure to mark which unit the general and the division commander is with, as well as any lieutenants or other heroes (p. XX). Note down which units are <strong>missile units</strong>, <strong>loose units</strong>, <strong>cavalry units</strong>, <strong>artillery units</strong>, and <strong>war machine units</strong>.</p>\n<h3>Setting up the Assault</h3>\n<p>On a battlemat or large sheet of paper, divide the battlefield into Stronghold, Stronghold Interior, Assault, and Reserve zones, as shown.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Reserve</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td>Assault</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td>Stronghold Walls</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td>Stronghold Interior</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h3>Deploying the Armies</h3>\n<p>Each side now deploys its army, starting with the besieging army.</p>\n<p>The besieging army’s leader selects one or more units from his army to serve as <strong>assaulting units</strong>. A maximum of 1 unit per point of unit capacity plus 1 additional unit per breach in the stronghold can be assigned to the assault. The leader must designate which units are assaulting through breaches. Units that attack in the Artillery and Missile phase cannot be assigned to assault through breaches. Other units are assumed to be assaulting with siege ladders. The leader does not have to assault with the maximum number of units if he doesn’t want to. The besieging army leader should also decide what artillery and siege equipment, if any, is being used in the assault. Artillery and siege equipment do not count against the maximum number of units. All assaulting units are placed in the assault zone. All other units are placed in the reserve zone.</p>\n<p>The defending army’s leader selects one or more units from his army to serve as <strong>defending units</strong>. A maximum of 1 unit per point of unit capacity may be assigned to the defense. Breaches do not increase the number of defending units allowed. The leader does not have to defend with the maximum number of units if he doesn’t want to. The defending army leader should also decide what artillery and siege equipment, if any, is being used in the defense. Artillery and siege equipment do not count against maximum number of units. All defending units are assigned to the stronghold walls zone. All units other units are in the stronghold interior zone.</p>\n<h3>Resolving the Assaults</h3>\n<p>Assaults are resolved in a series of <strong>assault turns</strong> following the procedure below. Each assault turn represents approximately 10 minutes of hard fighting. Note that while artillery in a battle fire during the missile phase, artillery in assaults have a separate phase.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Artillery Phase.</strong> In this phase, artillery units in the assault and stronghold zones exchange fire.<ol>\n<li>Calculate Battle Ratings. Each army leader sums the battle rating of all artillery units in the appropriate zone.</li>\n<li>Make Heroic Forays.Heroic PCs and NPCs in the zone can now make <strong>heroic forays</strong> at artillery range to influence the battle rating in favor of one army or the other. All heroes’ heroic forays are revealed and resolved simultaneously. Lost units are then removed.</li>\n<li>Determine Hits.Each army leader simultaneously rolls a number of attack throws equal to the battle rating of the artillery units that remain in the zone. The target value for the attack throws is 18+, modified by the Attack Throw Modifiers listed below. For each successful attack throw, one hit is scored. If at the start of step c, one side has no units in its zone, see <strong>Breaking a Zone</strong> (p. XX).</li>\n<li>Apply Casualties.Each army leader tallies the hits scored against his army. The besieging army leader then removes units from the assault zone with a combined battle rating equal to or greater than the total hits scored against his army. The defending army leader removes units from the stronghold walls zone in like manner. The units removed do not need to be artillery units. These units are destroyed (or, if loose units, <strong>withdrawn</strong>; see below). If all of an army’s units in a zone are defeated, the remaining hits are lost. Hits are applied simultaneously.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Missile Phase.</strong> In this phase, missile units in the assault and stronghold zones exchange fire.<ol>\n<li>Calculate Battle Ratings.Each army leader sums the battle rating of all missile units in the appropriate zone.</li>\n<li>Make Heroic Forays.Heroic PCs and NPCs in the zone can now make <strong>heroic forays</strong> at missile range to influence the battle rating in favor of one army or the other.

The target value for the attack throws is 17+, modified by the Attack Throw Modifiers listed below. For each successful attack throw, one hit is scored. If at the start of step c, one side has no units in its zone, see <strong>Breaking a Zone</strong> (p. XX).</li>\n<li>Apply Casualties.Each army leader tallies the hits scored against his army. The besieging army leader then removes units from the assault zone with a combined battle rating equal to or greater than the total hits scored against his army. The defending army leader removes units from the stronghold walls zone in like manner. The units removed do not need to be missile units. These units are destroyed (or, if loose units, <strong>withdrawn</strong>; see below). If all of an army’s units in a zone are defeated, the remaining hits are lost. Hits are applied simultaneously.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Melee Phase.</strong> In this phase, melee units in the assault and stronghold zones exchange fire.<ol>\n<li>Calculate Battle Ratings.Each army leader sums the battle rating of all remaining units in the appropriate zone. War machines that have battle ratings are included in this total. War machines that have special effects (such as offering an additional attack throw) take effect in step c.</li>\n<li>Make Heroic Forays.Heroic PCs and NPCs in the zone can now make <strong>heroic forays</strong> at missile range to influence the battle rating in favor of one army or the other. All heroes’ heroic forays are revealed and resolved simultaneously. Lost units are then removed.</li>\n<li>Determine Hits.Each army leader simultaneously rolls a number of attack throws equal to the battle rating of the units that remain in the zone. The target value for the attack throws is 16+, modified by the Attack Throw Modifiers listed below. For each successful attack throw, one hit is scored. If at the start of step c, one side has no units in its zone, see <strong>Breaking a Zone</strong> (p. XX).</li>\n<li>Apply Casualties.Each army leader tallies the hits scored against his army. The besieging army leader then removes units from the assault zone with a combined battle rating equal to or greater than the total hits scored against his army. The defending army leader removes units from the stronghold walls zone in like manner. The units removed do not need to be melee units or war machines. These units are destroyed. Loose units cannot withdraw during the assault phase. If all of an army’s units in a zone are defeated, the remaining hits are lost. Hits are applied simultaneously.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Morale Phase.</strong> The Judge now checks to see whether either army has reached a <strong>break point</strong> and if so resolves <strong>morale rolls</strong>, as explained in <strong>Ending Battles</strong> (p. XX).</li>\n<li><strong>Victory Check Phase.</strong> If all of the defending units are defeated, and the defending army has no units in the interior zone, the stronghold is captured. If all of the assaulting units are defeated, and the besieging army has no units in the reserve zone, then the stronghold is liberated. Either way, see <strong>Ending Sieges</strong> (p. XX).</li>\n<li><strong>Redeployment Phase.</strong> Either army can now <strong>redeploy</strong> units. The army leader with the lower strategic ability must redeploy first. The army leader can redeploy a number of units equal to this Leadership Ability. A besieging unit can be moved from the assault zone to the reserve zone or vice versa. A defending unit can be moved from the stronghold to the interior zone, or vice versa. Wavering and disordered units cannot be redeployed. In lieu of redeploying a unit, the besieging army leader can assign it to assault through a breach that does not have a unit assigned to it. In lieu of redeploying one or more units, each leader can <strong>regroup</strong> a unit or units that have <strong>wavered</strong> or become <strong>disordered</strong>, ending those conditions. Heroes can be move like units, but do not count against the leader’s Leadership Ability. The maximum number of units (other than heroes, artillery units, and war machine units) in the assault zone cannot exceed of 1 unit per point of unit capacity plus 1 additional unit per breach in the stronghold</li>\n<li><strong>Surrender Phase.</strong> The defending army can now voluntarily surrender. If the defending army surrenders, the stronghold is captured. See <strong>Ending Sieges</strong>. Otherwise, the besieging army can renew the assault or call it off. If the besieging army renews the assault, then another assault turn is fought, starting with step 1. If the besieging army calls off the assault, the assault ends but the siege itself continues.</li>\n</ol>\n<h6>Attack Throw Modifiers during Assaults</h6>\n<p>In addition the modifiers that apply in battle, unit attack throws are modified by the following factors during an assault:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Attack Throw Modifiers</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Modifier</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Attack by assaulting unit other than artillery, flyer, missile unit, or unit assaulting through a breach</td>\n<td>-2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Attack by a defending unit</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h6>Artillery and Siege Equipment During Assaults</h6>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Artillery and Siege Equipment Battle Ratings</strong></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Type of Equipment</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Unit Size</strong></td>\n<td><strong>BR</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Notes</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><em>Artillery</em></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Light Ballista</td>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Light Repeating Ballista</td>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td><em>1</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Medium Ballista</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td><em>-</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Heavy Ballista</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td><em>-</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Light Catapult</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td><em>-</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Medium Catapult</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td><em>-</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Heavy Catapult</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td><em>-</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Light Trebuchet</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td><em>-</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Medium Trebuchet</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td><em>-</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Heavy Trebuchet</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td><em>-</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><em>Siege Equipment</em></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Battering Ram (20’)</td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td><em>2, 3</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cauldron</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td><em>4, 5</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Hoist</td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td><em>2</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Movable Gallery</td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td><em>2, 6</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Movable Mantlet</td>\n<td>60</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td><em>2, 6</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Ram Catcher</td>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td><em>4, 7</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Screw (20’)</td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td><em>2, 3</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Siege Hook</td>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td><em>2, 8</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Siege Tower, Standard</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td><em>2</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Siege Tower, Large</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td><em>2</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Siege Tower, Huge</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>8</td>\n<td><em>2</em></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>When used during assaults, artillery and siege equipment must be grouped into units. The number of pieces of artillery or siege equipment required to form a unit depends on the type of artillery or equipment. The unit size and battle rating of artillery and siege equipment units is listed in the Artillery and Siege Equipment Battle Rating table. Artillery and siege equipment not present in sufficient numbers to form a unit do not affect the assault. A leader does not haveto use artillery and siege equipment if he would prefer not to risk it.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: Moruvai’s defending army fields 2 medium trebuchets, 5 heavy ballista, and 20 light ballista. When his stronghold is assaulted, he forms these into 2 units of 1 medium trebuchet each (BR 2 each), 1 unit of 5 heavy ballista each (BR 6), and 2 units of light ballista (BR 3 each). His artillery adds 2 + 2 + 6 + 3 + 3 =16 to his army’s battle rating.</p>\n<p>**Unit Size:**The minimum number of pieces of artillery or siege equipment that must be deployed to have an effect on an assault. For example, deploying one 20’ ram will not have any game effect, but deploying six 20’ rams will increase an army’s BR by 1. For siege equipment of varying size (such as rams), a sufficiently oversized piece can qualify as a unit by itself. For example, a single 120’ ram would have BR 1.</p>\n<p><strong>BR:</strong> Artillery and siege equipment units with a battle rating function exactly like assaulting/defending units for all purposes, except they do not count against the unit capacity restrictions on assault and defense. An army is limited to a maximum BR from siege equipment equal to its BR from assaulting/defending units. (There have to be troops to carry the equipment!)</p>\n<p><strong>Notes:</strong> Some units have special capabilities or restrictions, explained below.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Light repeating ballista units can make four attacks during the artillery phase of each assault turn, but the ballistas break down on any unmodified throw of “1”. Broken ballista units are removed from the assault but not destroyed.</li>\n<li>This war machine can only be deployed by the besieging army.</li>\n<li>A ram or screw unit can make one attack throw during the melee phase of each assault turn; if the attack succeeds, the unit creates a temporary breach to which an assaulting unit can be assigned in the Redeployment phase. The temporary breach lasts until the besieging army calls off the assault or captures the stronghold.</li>\n<li>This war machine can only be deployed by the defending army.</li>\n<li>A cauldron unit provides a bonus attack throw during the melee phase.</li>\n<li>A gallery or mantlet unit can absorb one hit dealt during any phase of an assault turn. Absorbing a hit destroys the gallery or mantlet unit.</li>\n<li>A ram catcher can make one attack throw during the missile phase of each battle turn; if the throw succeeds, the unit destroys a ram or screw unit, if any are present.</li>\n<li>A siege hook reduces the BR of one defending army unit in the melee phase by one for purposes of attacks and hits.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Acquiring Artillery and Siege Equipment:</strong> If in supply, an army may acquire artillery and siege equipment from the market. Either army may construct artillery and siege equipment as construction projects.</p>\n<h6>Battle Ratings During Assaults</h6>\n<p>See Chapter 9, <strong>Unit Characteristics Summary</strong> (p. XX), for a list of battle ratings by unit type. All defending units, other than cavalry units, have their BR increased by 1 due to the protection of the stronghold. For example, a unit of heavy infantry (BR 2) defending a stronghold has its BR increased to 3. It will roll three attack throws and will take three hits to eliminate.</p>\n<p>Except when assaulting through a breach, assaulting cavalry units have their BR reduced to one-quarter their base value (round up). This represents the fact that they must fight dismounted as half-strength infantry.</p>\n<h6>Besieger Breakthroughs and Defender Sallies</h6>\n<p>If, at the start of any step (c), Determine Hits*,* the stronghold zone has no units in it, then the besieging army has achieved a <strong>breakthrough.</strong> The assaulting units in that phase can attack units in the interior zone at a +2 bonus to their attack throws. The units in the interior do not get to attack.</p>\n<p>Likewise, if at the start of any step (c), the assault zone has no units in it, then the defending army has earned a <strong>sally.</strong> Defending units in that phase can attack units in the reserve zone at a +2 bonus to their attack throws. The units in the reserve do not get to attack.</p>\n<h6>Casualties</h6>\n<p>When an assault ends, each army’s leader must determine his army’s casualties using the following rules.</p>\n<p><strong>Unit Loss</strong>*:*For each unit that was defeated, 50% of its troops (rounded up) are crippled or dead, while the other 50% (rounded down) are lightly wounded. The fate of wounded troops depends on how the assault ended.</p>\n<p>If the besieging army captured the stronghold, then its wounded troops are assumed to be treated and recover during the next week. The defending army’s wounded troops become prisoners, as do any surrendering troops. A defending army’s leader may negotiate for other terms during a voluntary surrender, but it will ultimately be up to the besieging army whether these terms are honored.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: After a brutal assault, the defending army surrenders in the face of overwhelming odds. The defending army began with 10 heavy infantry units. In the course of several assault turns, 7 heavy infantry units (840 men) were defeated. 420 men are crippled or dead, and 420 are prisoners. The remaining 3 units (360 men) also become prisoners.</p>\n<p>If the defending army fought off the assault, then its wounded troops recover during the next week. The besieging army’s wounded troops are left behind and become prisoners of the defending army.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: A besieging army of 20 units has had 8 heavy infantry units (960 troops) defeated in a futile assault. 480 troops are crippled/dead and 480 are wounded and captured by the defending army.</p>\n<p>As always, half-strength units may be consolidated to form a smaller number of full-strength units, if desired.</p>\n<p><strong>Prisoners:</strong> Prisoners can be executed, kept as slaves, or ransomed for 40gp each as spoils of war. (Higher level NPCs, monsters, and similar creatures can be ransomed for greater sums, at the Judge’s discretion.) Defending armies usually lack the supplies to feed prisoners, so they will likely be killed or ransomed. Cunning defenders may use prisoners as leverage to negotiate surrender terms.</p>\n<h6>Heroic Forays During Assaults</h6>\n<p>As with battles, heroes can influence the outcome of assaults by making heroic forays. The mechanics for heroic forays during assaults are identical to those for heroic forays during battles, except as noted below.</p>\n<p><strong>Artillery and Siege Equipment:</strong> Units of artillery and siege equipment can appear as foes for either side. See the Artillery and Siege Equipment Battle Rating table, above,for the battle ratings of various war machines. The effects of artillery and siege equipment on personal combat are as described in Chapter 6 (p. XX).</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: Moruvai makes a heroic foray in defense of his keep during the assault phase. He and his henchmen stake a total of 2 BR. The Judge picks a selection of troops from Marcus and Peristo’s army. He notes that Marcus’s army has deployed a huge 120’ battering ram. The Judge decides that Moruvai’s foray will be to stop a unit of 120 light infantry (1 point of BR) crewing the battering ram (1 BR).</p>\n<p><strong>Defending the Stronghold:</strong> Missile attacks targeting creatures defending the walls of the stronghold suffer a -4 penalty, and the creatures gain a +4 bonus to saving throws versus Blast caused by artillery, burning oil, or similar effects. On a successful saving throw, creatures defending the walls take nodamage, even if the effect would normally deal half damage.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Terrain Type</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Artillery Encounter Distance</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Missile Encounter Distance</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Melee Encounter Distance</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Barrens (any)</td>\n<td>4d20 x 30’ (1260’)</td>\n<td>4d6 x 30’ (420’)</td>\n<td>2d6+1 x 15’ (120’)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Desert (rocky)</td>\n<td>6d20 x 30’ (1890’)</td>\n<td>5d6 x 30’ (480’)</td>\n<td>2d6+1 x 15’ (120’)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Desert (sandy)</td>\n<td>4d20 x 30’ (1260’)</td>\n<td>5d6 x 30’ (480’)</td>\n<td>2d6+1 x 15’ (120’)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Forest (open)</td>\n<td>4d6 x 30’ (420’)</td>\n<td>3d6 x 15’ (160’)</td>\n<td>2d6+1 x 15’ (120’)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Forest (closed)</td>\n<td>3d6 x 15’ (160’)</td>\n<td>5d8 x 3’ (70’)</td>\n<td>5d8 x 3’ (70’)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Grassland (prairie)</td>\n<td>4d20 x 30’ (1260’)</td>\n<td>4d6 x 30’ (420’)</td>\n<td>2d6+1 x 15’ (120’)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Grassland (steppe)</td>\n<td>6d20 x 30’ (1890’)</td>\n<td>5d6 x 30’ (480’)</td>\n<td>2d6+1 x 15’ (120’)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Hills (forested)</td>\n<td>3d6 x 15’ (160’)</td>\n<td>5d8 x 3’ (70’)</td>\n<td>5d8 x 3’ (70’)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Hills (rocky)</td>\n<td>4d20 x 30’ (1260’)</td>\n<td>4d6 x 30’ (420’)</td>\n<td>2d6+1 x 15’ (120’)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Jungle (any)</td>\n<td>5d8 x 3’ (70’)</td>\n<td>5d4 x 3’ (40’)</td>\n<td>5d8 x 3’ (70’)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mountains (forested)</td>\n<td>3d6 x 15’ (157’)</td>\n<td>5d8 x 3’ (70’)</td>\n<td>5d8 x 3’ (70’)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mountains (rocky)</td>\n<td>4d20 x 30’ (1260’)</td>\n<td>4d6 x 30’ (420’)</td>\n<td>2d6+1 x 15’ (120’)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Scrubland (low, sparse)</td>\n<td>4d20 x 30’ (1260’)</td>\n<td>4d6 x 30’ (420’)</td>\n<td>2d6+1 x 15’ (120’)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Scrubland (high, dense)</td>\n<td>4d6 x 30’ (420’)</td>\n<td>3d6 x 15’ (157’)</td>\n<td>2d6+1 x 15’ (120’)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Swamp (marshy)</td>\n<td>4d6 x 30’ (420’)</td>\n<td>3d6 x 15’ (157’)</td>\n<td>2d6+1 x 15’ (120’)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Swamp (scrubby)</td>\n<td>3d6 x 15’ (160’)</td>\n<td>5d8 x 3’ (70’)</td>\n<td>5d8 x 3’ (70’)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Encounter Distance:</strong> The foray begins with all participants from the defending army inside the stronghold. Participants from the besieging army begin outside, some distance from the stronghold’s walls. The Judge can set the Assault Encounter Distance based on his map of the region or use the Assault Encounter Distance table to determine how far away the foraying heroes are from the stronghold’s walls at the start of the foray. The maximum artillery encounter distance will be equal to or less than the longest-ranged artillery deployed by either side, and the maximum missile encounter distance will not exceed the longest-ranged handheld missile deployed by either side.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: Moruvai’s stronghold is situated on a rocky hill, and the heroes are foraying during a melee phase. The Judge consults the Assault Encounter Distance table and sees that the foray begins with the heroes 2d6+1 x 15’ from Moruvai’s stronghold. The result is an 8, indicating a distance of 120’.</p>\n<p><strong>Foe Selection:</strong> When picking foes, remember that defending units are worth one additional point of BR each.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE**:** Marcus and Peristo make a heroic foray against Moruvai’s keep. The two heroes and their allies stake a total of 3 BR. Moruvai’s walls are defended by goblin light infantry units. Goblin light infantry normally have a battle rating of 0.5, but as defending units, their battle rating is increased by 1 each, to 1.5. The Judge decides that Marcus and Peristo’s foray will face 2 goblin light infantry units (BR 1.5 x 2 = 3).</p>\n<h6>Withdrawal</h6>\n<p>Loose units aren’t deployed to hold ground or fight to the last man. When applying hits to his units during the artillery or missile phase, the army leader will count loose units as having only half their BR. However, instead of being killed, the units withdraw to the reserve or interior, where they become <strong>disordered</strong>. Place the unit in the reserve or interior, and mark it with a token to represent its disordered state. A disordered unit cannot be redeployed until it is rallied. A unit cannot be rallied and redeployed in the same battle turn. A loose unit that is being attack in the reserve by a sally, or attacked in the interior by a breakthrough, cannot withdraw. A loose unit cannot withdraw during the assault phase. In such cases, the loose units apply their full BR when counting hits.</p>\n<h3>Special Rules for Dungeon Assaults</h3>\n<p>Assaults on dungeons or other underground structures are considerably more dangerous and difficult than assaults on castles, keeps, and towers. The following special rules apply:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Catapults, trebuchets, and siege towers cannot be used in dungeon assaults.</li>\n<li>Each and every entrance to the dungeon (including entrances created by an earlier breach) counts as separate assault zone for the besieger and a separate wall zone for the defender. The besieger still has just one reserve zone and the defender still has just one interior zone that connect to these zones.</li>\n<li>The besieger can deploy 1 unit to each assault zone but only if the zone’s dungeon entrance is known and accessible to the besieger. The defending army can deploy 1 unit to each wall zone.</li>\n<li>All units act in the melee phase regardless of type.</li>\n<li>If, at the start of step (c), Determine Hits*,* a wall zone does not have a defending unit in it, then the assaulting unit in the opposing assault zone can conduct a breakthrough attack against the interior at a +2 bonus to its attack throws. The units in the interior do not get to attack.</li>\n<li>If, at the start of step (c), Determine Hits*,* an assault zone does not have an assaulting unit in, then the defending unit in the opposing wall zone can conduct a sally against the reserve at a +2 bonus to its attack throws. Since a besieger cannot assign units to an unknown entrance, a defender can always make a sally from that dungeon entrance. However, the sally automatically reveals the location of the entrance to the besieging army.</li>\n</ul>\n",

The number of pieces of artillery or siege equipment required to form a unit depends on the type of artillery or equipment. The unit size and battle rating of artillery and siege equipment units is listed in the Artillery and Siege Equipment Battle Rating table. Artillery and siege equipment not present in sufficient numbers to form a unit do not affect the assault. A leader does not haveto use artillery and siege equipment if he would prefer not to risk it.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: Moruvai’s defending army fields 2 medium trebuchets, 5 heavy ballista, and 20 light ballista. When his stronghold is assaulted, he forms these into 2 units of 1 medium trebuchet each (BR 2 each), 1 unit of 5 heavy ballista each (BR 6), and 2 units of light ballista (BR 3 each). His artillery adds 2 + 2 + 6 + 3 + 3 =16 to his army’s battle rating.</p>\n<p>**Unit Size:**The minimum number of pieces of artillery or siege equipment that must be deployed to have an effect on an assault. For example, deploying one 20’ ram will not have any game effect, but deploying six 20’ rams will increase an army’s BR by 1. For siege equipment of varying size (such as rams), a sufficiently oversized piece can qualify as a unit by itself. For example, a single 120’ ram would have BR 1.</p>\n<p><strong>BR:</strong> Artillery and siege equipment units with a battle rating function exactly like assaulting/defending units for all purposes, except they do not count against the unit capacity restrictions on assault and defense. An army is limited to a maximum BR from siege equipment equal to its BR from assaulting/defending units. (There have to be troops to carry the equipment!)</p>\n<p><strong>Notes:</strong> Some units have special capabilities or restrictions, explained below.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Light repeating ballista units can make four attacks during the artillery phase of each assault turn, but the ballistas break down on any unmodified throw of “1”. Broken ballista units are removed from the assault but not destroyed.</li>\n<li>This war machine can only be deployed by the besieging army.</li>\n<li>A ram or screw unit can make one attack throw during the melee phase of each assault turn; if the attack succeeds, the unit creates a temporary breach to which an assaulting unit can be assigned in the Redeployment phase. The temporary breach lasts until the besieging army calls off the assault or captures the stronghold.</li>\n<li>This war machine can only be deployed by the defending army.</li>\n<li>A cauldron unit provides a bonus attack throw during the melee phase.</li>\n<li>A gallery or mantlet unit can absorb one hit dealt during any phase of an assault turn. Absorbing a hit destroys the gallery or mantlet unit.</li>\n<li>A ram catcher can make one attack throw during the missile phase of each battle turn; if the throw succeeds, the unit destroys a ram or screw unit, if any are present.</li>\n<li>A siege hook reduces the BR of one defending army unit in the melee phase by one for purposes of attacks and hits.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Acquiring Artillery and Siege Equipment:</strong> If in supply, an army may acquire artillery and siege equipment from the market. Either army may construct artillery and siege equipment as construction projects.</p>\n"

Group the units into their divisions and be sure to mark which unit the general and the division commander is with, as well as any lieutenants or other heroes (p. XX). Note down which units are **missile units**, **loose units**, **cavalry units**, **artillery units**, and **war machine units**.\n\n### Setting up the Assault\n\nOn a battlemat or large sheet of paper, divide the battlefield into Stronghold, Stronghold Interior, Assault, and Reserve zones, as shown.\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Reserve | | | | | | |\n|  |  | Assault | | |  |  |\n|  |  | Stronghold Walls | | |  |  |\n|  |  |  | Stronghold Interior |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n\n### Deploying the Armies\n\nEach side now deploys its army, starting with the besieging army.\n\nThe besieging army’s leader selects one or more units from his army to serve as **assaulting units**. A maximum of 1 unit per point of unit capacity plus 1 additional unit per breach in the stronghold can be assigned to the assault. The leader must designate which units are assaulting through breaches. Units that attack in the Artillery and Missile phase cannot be assigned to assault through breaches. Other units are assumed to be assaulting with siege ladders. The leader does not have to assault with the maximum number of units if he doesn’t want to. The besieging army leader should also decide what artillery and siege equipment, if any, is being used in the assault. Artillery and siege equipment do not count against the maximum number of units. All assaulting units are placed in the assault zone. All other units are placed in the reserve zone.\n\nThe defending army’s leader selects one or more units from his army to serve as **defending units**. A maximum of 1 unit per point of unit capacity may be assigned to the defense. Breaches do not increase the number of defending units allowed. The leader does not have to defend with the maximum number of units if he doesn’t want to. The defending army leader should also decide what artillery and siege equipment, if any, is being used in the defense. Artillery and siege equipment do not count against maximum number of units. All defending units are assigned to the stronghold walls zone. All units other units are in the stronghold interior zone.\n\n### Resolving the Assaults\n\nAssaults are resolved in a series of **assault turns** following the procedure below. Each assault turn represents approximately 10 minutes of hard fighting. Note that while artillery in a battle fire during the missile phase, artillery in assaults have a separate phase.\n\n1. **Artillery Phase.** In this phase, artillery units in the assault and stronghold zones exchange fire.\n   1. Calculate Battle Ratings. Each army leader sums the battle rating of all artillery units in the appropriate zone.\n   2. Make Heroic Forays.Heroic PCs and NPCs in the zone can now make **heroic forays** at artillery range to influence the battle rating in favor of one army or the other. All heroes’ heroic forays are revealed and resolved simultaneously. Lost units are then removed.\n   3. Determine Hits.Each army leader simultaneously rolls a number of attack throws equal to the battle rating of the artillery units that remain in the zone. The target value for the attack throws is 18+, modified by the Attack Throw Modifiers listed below. For each successful attack throw, one hit is scored. If at the start of step c, one side has no units in its zone, see **Breaking a Zone** (p. XX).\n   4. Apply Casualties.Each army leader tallies the hits scored against his army. The besieging army leader then removes units from the assault zone with a combined battle rating equal to or greater than the total hits scored against his army. The defending army leader removes units from the stronghold walls zone in like manner. The units removed do not need to be artillery units. These units are destroyed (or, if loose units, **withdrawn**; see below). If all of an army’s units in a zone are defeated, the remaining hits are lost. Hits are applied simultaneously.\n2. **Missile Phase.** In this phase, missile units in the assault and stronghold zones exchange fire.\n   1. Calculate Battle Ratings.Each army leader sums the battle rating of all missile units in the appropriate zone.\n   2. Make Heroic Forays.Heroic PCs and NPCs in the zone can now make **heroic forays** at missile range to influence the battle rating in favor of one army or the other. All heroes’ heroic forays are revealed and resolved simultaneously. Lost units are then removed.\n   3. Determine Hits.Each army leader simultaneously rolls a number of attack throws equal to the battle rating of the missile units that remain in the zone. The target value for the attack throws is 17+, modified by the Attack Throw Modifiers listed below. For each successful attack throw, one hit is scored. If at the start of step c, one side has no units in its zone, see **Breaking a Zone** (p. XX).\n   4. Apply Casualties.Each army leader tallies the hits scored against his army. The besieging army leader then removes units from the assault zone with a combined battle rating equal to or greater than the total hits scored against his army. The defending army leader removes units from the stronghold walls zone in like manner. The units removed do not need to be missile units. These units are destroyed (or, if loose units, **withdrawn**; see below). If all of an army’s units in a zone are defeated, the remaining hits are lost. Hits are applied simultaneously.\n3. **Melee Phase.** In this phase, melee units in the assault and stronghold zones exchange fire.\n   1. Calculate Battle Ratings.Each army leader sums the battle rating of all remaining units in the appropriate zone. War machines that have battle ratings are included in this total. War machines that have special effects (such as offering an additional attack throw) take effect in step c.\n   2. Make Heroic Forays.Heroic PCs and NPCs in the zone can now make **heroic forays** at missile range to influence the battle rating in favor of one army or the other. All heroes’ heroic forays are revealed and resolved simultaneously. Lost units are then removed.\n   3. Determine Hits.Each army leader simultaneously rolls a number of attack throws equal to the battle rating of the units that remain in the zone. The target value for the attack throws is 16+, modified by the Attack Throw Modifiers listed below. For each successful attack throw, one hit is scored. If at the start of step c, one side has no units in its zone, see **Breaking a Zone** (p. XX).\n   4. Apply Casualties.Each army leader tallies the hits scored against his army. The besieging army leader then removes units from the assault zone with a combined battle rating equal to or greater than the total hits scored against his army. The defending army leader removes units from the stronghold walls zone in like manner. The units removed do not need to be melee units or war machines. These units are destroyed. Loose units cannot withdraw during the assault phase. If all of an army’s units in a zone are defeated, the remaining hits are lost. Hits are applied simultaneously.\n4. **Morale Phase.** The Judge now checks to see whether either army has reached a **break point** and if so resolves **morale rolls**, as explained in **Ending Battles** (p. XX).\n5. **Victory Check Phase.** If all of the defending units are defeated, and the defending army has no units in the interior zone, the stronghold is captured. If all of the assaulting units are defeated, and the besieging army has no units in the reserve zone, then the stronghold is liberated. Either way, see **Ending Sieges** (p. XX).\n6. **Redeployment Phase.** Either army can now **redeploy** units. The army leader with the lower strategic ability must redeploy first. The army leader can redeploy a number of units equal to this Leadership Ability. A besieging unit can be moved from the assault zone to the reserve zone or vice versa. A defending unit can be moved from the stronghold to the interior zone, or vice versa. Wavering and disordered units cannot be redeployed. In lieu of redeploying a unit, the besieging army leader can assign it to assault through a breach that does not have a unit assigned to it. In lieu of redeploying one or more units, each leader can **regroup** a unit or units that have **wavered** or become **disordered**, ending those conditions. Heroes can be move like units, but do not count against the leader’s Leadership Ability. The maximum number of units (other than heroes, artillery units, and war machine units) in the assault zone cannot exceed of 1 unit per point of unit capacity plus 1 additional unit per breach in the stronghold\n7. **Surrender Phase.** The defending army can now voluntarily surrender. If the defending army surrenders, the stronghold is captured. See **Ending Sieges**. Otherwise, the besieging army can renew the assault or call it off. If the besieging army renews the assault, then another assault turn is fought, starting with step 1. If the besieging army calls off the assault, the assault ends but the siege itself continues.\n\n###### Attack Throw Modifiers during Assaults\n\nIn addition the modifiers that apply in battle, unit attack throws are modified by the following factors during an assault:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Attack Throw Modifiers** | **Modifier** |\n| Attack by assaulting unit other than artillery, flyer, missile unit, or unit assaulting through a breach | -2 |\n| Attack by a defending unit | +2 |\n\n###### Artillery and Siege Equipment During Assaults\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Artillery and Siege Equipment Battle Ratings** | | | |\n| **Type of Equipment** | **Unit Size** | **BR** | **Notes** |\n| *Artillery* |  |  | - |\n| Light Ballista | 10 | 3 | - |\n| Light Repeating Ballista | 10 | 3 | *1* |\n| Medium Ballista | 5 | 3 | *-* |\n| Heavy Ballista | 5 | 6 | *-* |\n| Light Catapult | 5 | 2 | *-* |\n| Medium Catapult | 2 | 3 | *-* |\n| Heavy Catapult | 2 | 3 | *-* |\n| Light Trebuchet | 2 | 3 | *-* |\n| Medium Trebuchet | 1 | 2 | *-* |\n| Heavy Trebuchet | 1 | 2 | *-* |\n| *Siege Equipment* |  |  |  |\n| Battering Ram (20’) | 6 | - | *2, 3* |\n| Cauldron | 4 | - | *4, 5* |\n| Hoist | 6 | 1 | *2* |\n| Movable Gallery | 6 | - | *2, 6* |\n| Movable Mantlet | 60 | - | *2, 6* |\n| Ram Catcher | 10 | - | *4, 7* |\n| Screw (20’) | 6 | 1 | *2, 3* |\n| Siege Hook | 10 | - | *2, 8* |\n| Siege Tower, Standard | 2 | 1 | *2* |\n| Siege Tower, Large | 1 | 2 | *2* |\n| Siege Tower, Huge | 1 | 8 | *2* |\n\nWhen used during assaults, artillery and siege equipment must be grouped into units. The number of pieces of artillery or siege equipment required to form a unit depends on the type of artillery or equipment. The unit size and battle rating of artillery and siege equipment units is listed in the Artillery and Siege Equipment Battle Rating table. Artillery and siege equipment not present in sufficient numbers to form a unit do not affect the assault. A leader does not haveto use artillery and siege equipment if he would prefer not to risk it.\n\nEXAMPLE: Moruvai’s defending army fields 2 medium trebuchets, 5 heavy ballista, and 20 light ballista. When his stronghold is assaulted, he forms these into 2 units of 1 medium trebuchet each (BR 2 each), 1 unit of 5 heavy ballista each (BR 6), and 2 units of light ballista (BR 3 each). His artillery adds 2 + 2 + 6 + 3 + 3 =16 to his army’s battle rating.\n\n**Unit Size:**The minimum number of pieces of artillery or siege equipment that must be deployed to have an effect on an assault. For example, deploying one 20’ ram will not have any game effect, but deploying six 20’ rams will increase an army’s BR by 1. For siege equipment of varying size (such as rams), a sufficiently oversized piece can qualify as a unit by itself. For example, a single 120’ ram would have BR 1.\n\n**BR:** Artillery and siege equipment units with a battle rating function exactly like assaulting/defending units for all purposes, except they do not count against the unit capacity restrictions on assault and defense. An army is limited to a maximum BR from siege equipment equal to its BR from assaulting/defending units. (There have to be troops to carry the equipment!)\n\n**Notes:** Some units have special capabilities or restrictions, explained below.\n\n1. Light repeating ballista units can make four attacks during the artillery phase of each assault turn, but the ballistas break down on any unmodified throw of “1”. Broken ballista units are removed from the assault but not destroyed.\n2. This war machine can only be deployed by the besieging army.\n3. A ram or screw unit can make one attack throw during the melee phase of each assault turn; if the attack succeeds, the unit creates a temporary breach to which an assaulting unit can be assigned in the Redeployment phase. The temporary breach lasts until the besieging army calls off the assault or captures the stronghold.\n4. This war machine can only be deployed by the defending army.\n5. A cauldron unit provides a bonus attack throw during the melee phase.\n6. A gallery or mantlet unit can absorb one hit dealt during any phase of an assault turn. Absorbing a hit destroys the gallery or mantlet unit.\n7. A ram catcher can make one attack throw during the missile phase of each battle turn; if the throw succeeds, the unit destroys a ram or screw unit, if any are present.\n8. A siege hook reduces the BR of one defending army unit in the melee phase by one for purposes of attacks and hits.\n\n**Acquiring Artillery and Siege Equipment:** If in supply, an army may acquire artillery and siege equipment from the market. Either army may construct artillery and siege equipment as construction projects.\n\n###### Battle Ratings During Assaults\n\nSee Chapter 9, **Unit Characteristics Summary** (p. XX), for a list of battle ratings by unit type. All defending units, other than cavalry units, have their BR increased by 1 due to the protection of the stronghold. For example, a unit of heavy infantry (BR 2) defending a stronghold has its BR increased to 3. It will roll three attack throws and will take three hits to eliminate.\n\nExcept when assaulting through a breach, assaulting cavalry units have their BR reduced to one-quarter their base value (round up). This represents the fact that they must fight dismounted as half-strength infantry.\n\n###### Besieger Breakthroughs and Defender Sallies\n\nIf, at the start of any step (c), Determine Hits*,* the stronghold zone has no units in it, then the besieging army has achieved a **breakthrough.** The assaulting units in that phase can attack units in the interior zone at a +2 bonus to their attack throws. The units in the interior do not get to attack.\n\nLikewise, if at the start of any step (c), the assault zone has no units in it, then the defending army has earned a **sally.** Defending units in that phase can attack units in the reserve zone at a +2 bonus to their attack throws. The units in the reserve do not get to attack.\n\n###### Casualties\n\nWhen an assault ends, each army’s leader must determine his army’s casualties using the following rules.\n\n**Unit Loss***:*For each unit that was defeated, 50% of its troops (rounded up) are crippled or dead, while the other 50% (rounded down) are lightly wounded. The fate of wounded troops depends on how the assault ended.\n\nIf the besieging army captured the stronghold, then its wounded troops are assumed to be treated and recover during the next week. The defending army’s wounded troops become prisoners, as do any surrendering troops. A defending army’s leader may negotiate for other terms during a voluntary surrender, but it will ultimately be up to the besieging army whether these terms are honored.\n\nEXAMPLE: After a brutal assault, the defending army surrenders in the face of overwhelming odds. The defending army began with 10 heavy infantry units. In the course of several assault turns, 7 heavy infantry units (840 men) were defeated. 420 men are crippled or dead, and 420 are prisoners. The remaining 3 units (360 men) also become prisoners.\n\nIf the defending army fought off the assault, then its wounded troops recover during the next week. The besieging army’s wounded troops are left behind and become prisoners of the defending army.\n\nEXAMPLE: A besieging army of 20 units has had 8 heavy infantry units (960 troops) defeated in a futile assault. 480 troops are crippled/dead and 480 are wounded and captured by the defending army.\n\nAs always, half-strength units may be consolidated to form a smaller number of full-strength units, if desired.\n\n**Prisoners:** Prisoners can be executed, kept as slaves, or ransomed for 40gp each as spoils of war. (Higher level NPCs, monsters, and similar creatures can be ransomed for greater sums, at the Judge’s discretion.) Defending armies usually lack the supplies to feed prisoners, so they will likely be killed or ransomed. Cunning defenders may use prisoners as leverage to negotiate surrender terms.\n\n###### Heroic Forays During Assaults\n\nAs with battles, heroes can influence the outcome of assaults by making heroic forays. The mechanics for heroic forays during assaults are identical to those for heroic forays during battles, except as noted below.\n\n**Artillery and Siege Equipment:** Units of artillery and siege equipment can appear as foes for either side. See the Artillery and Siege Equipment Battle Rating table, above,for the battle ratings of various war machines. The effects of artillery and siege equipment on personal combat are as described in Chapter 6 (p. XX).\n\nEXAMPLE: Moruvai makes a heroic foray in defense of his keep during the assault phase. He and his henchmen stake a total of 2 BR. The Judge picks a selection of troops from Marcus and Peristo’s army. He notes that Marcus’s army has deployed a huge 120’ battering ram. The Judge decides that Moruvai’s foray will be to stop a unit of 120 light infantry (1 point of BR) crewing the battering ram (1 BR).\n\n**Defending the Stronghold:** Missile attacks targeting creatures defending the walls of the stronghold suffer a -4 penalty, and the creatures gain a +4 bonus to saving throws versus Blast caused by artillery, burning oil, or similar effects. On a successful saving throw, creatures defending the walls take nodamage, even if the effect would normally deal half damage.\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Terrain Type** | **Artillery Encounter Distance** | **Missile Encounter Distance** | **Melee Encounter Distance** |\n| Barrens (any) | 4d20 x 30’ (1260’) | 4d6 x 30’ (420’) | 2d6+1 x 15’ (120’) |\n| Desert (rocky) | 6d20 x 30’ (1890’) | 5d6 x 30’ (480’) | 2d6+1 x 15’ (120’) |\n| Desert (sandy) | 4d20 x 30’ (1260’) | 5d6 x 30’ (480’) | 2d6+1 x 15’ (120’) |\n| Forest (open) | 4d6 x 30’ (420’) | 3d6 x 15’ (160’) | 2d6+1 x 15’ (120’) |\n| Forest (closed) | 3d6 x 15’ (160’) | 5d8 x 3’ (70’) | 5d8 x 3’ (70’) |\n| Grassland (prairie) | 4d20 x 30’ (1260’) | 4d6 x 30’ (420’) | 2d6+1 x 15’ (120’) |\n| Grassland (steppe) | 6d20 x 30’ (1890’) | 5d6 x 30’ (480’) | 2d6+1 x 15’ (120’) |\n| Hills (forested) | 3d6 x 15’ (160’) | 5d8 x 3’ (70’) | 5d8 x 3’ (70’) |\n| Hills (rocky) | 4d20 x 30’ (1260’) | 4d6 x 30’ (420’) | 2d6+1 x 15’ (120’) |\n| Jungle (any) | 5d8 x 3’ (70’) | 5d4 x 3’ (40’) | 5d8 x 3’ (70’) |\n| Mountains (forested) | 3d6 x 15’ (157’) | 5d8 x 3’ (70’) | 5d8 x 3’ (70’) |\n| Mountains (rocky) | 4d20 x 30’ (1260’) | 4d6 x 30’ (420’) | 2d6+1 x 15’ (120’) |\n| Scrubland (low, sparse) | 4d20 x 30’ (1260’) | 4d6 x 30’ (420’) | 2d6+1 x 15’ (120’) |\n| Scrubland (high, dense) | 4d6 x 30’ (420’) | 3d6 x 15’ (157’) | 2d6+1 x 15’ (120’) |\n| Swamp (marshy) | 4d6 x 30’ (420’) | 3d6 x 15’ (157’) | 2d6+1 x 15’ (120’) |\n| Swamp (scrubby) | 3d6 x 15’ (160’) | 5d8 x 3’ (70’) | 5d8 x 3’ (70’) |\n\n**Encounter Distance:** The foray begins with all participants from the defending army inside the stronghold. Participants from the besieging army begin outside, some distance from the stronghold’s walls. The Judge can set the Assault Encounter Distance based on his map of the region or use the Assault Encounter Distance table to determine how far away the foraying heroes are from the stronghold’s walls at the start of the foray. The maximum artillery encounter distance will be equal to or less than the longest-ranged artillery deployed by either side, and the maximum missile encounter distance will not exceed the longest-ranged handheld missile deployed by either side.\n\nEXAMPLE: Moruvai’s stronghold is situated on a rocky hill, and the heroes are foraying during a melee phase. The Judge consults the Assault Encounter Distance table and sees that the foray begins with the heroes 2d6+1 x 15’ from Moruvai’s stronghold. The result is an 8, indicating a distance of 120’.\n\n**Foe Selection:** When picking foes, remember that defending units are worth one additional point of BR each.\n\nEXAMPLE**:** Marcus and Peristo make a heroic foray against Moruvai’s keep. The two heroes and their allies stake a total of 3 BR. Moruvai’s walls are defended by goblin light infantry units. Goblin light infantry normally have a battle rating of 0.5, but as defending units, their battle rating is increased by 1 each, to 1.5. The Judge decides that Marcus and Peristo’s foray will face 2 goblin light infantry units (BR 1.5 x 2 = 3).\n\n###### Withdrawal\n\nLoose units aren’t deployed to hold ground or fight to the last man. When applying hits to his units during the artillery or missile phase, the army leader will count loose units as having only half their BR. However, instead of being killed, the units withdraw to the reserve or interior, where they become **disordered**. Place the unit in the reserve or interior, and mark it with a token to represent its disordered state. A disordered unit cannot be redeployed until it is rallied. A unit cannot be rallied and redeployed in the same battle turn. A loose unit that is being attack in the reserve by a sally, or attacked in the interior by a breakthrough, cannot withdraw. A loose unit cannot withdraw during the assault phase. In such cases, the loose units apply their full BR when counting hits.\n\n### Special Rules for Dungeon Assaults\n\nAssaults on dungeons or other underground structures are considerably more dangerous and difficult than assaults on castles, keeps, and towers. The following special rules apply:\n\n* Catapults, trebuchets, and siege towers cannot be used in dungeon assaults.\n* Each and every entrance to the dungeon (including entrances created by an earlier breach) counts as separate assault zone for the besieger and a separate wall zone for the defender. The besieger still has just one reserve zone and the defender still has just one interior zone that connect to these zones.\n* The besieger can deploy 1 unit to each assault zone but only if the zone’s dungeon entrance is known and accessible to the besieger. The defending army can deploy 1 unit to each wall zone.\n* All units act in the melee phase regardless of type.\n* If, at the start of step (c), Determine Hits*,* a wall zone does not have a defending unit in it, then the assaulting unit in the opposing assault zone can conduct a breakthrough attack against the interior at a +2 bonus to its attack throws. The units in the interior do not get to attack.\n* If, at the start of step (c), Determine Hits*,* an assault zone does not have an assaulting unit in, then the defending unit in the opposing wall zone can conduct a sally against the reserve at a +2 bonus to its attack throws. Since a besieger cannot assign units to an unknown entrance, a defender can always make a sally from that dungeon entrance. However, the sally automatically reveals the location of the entrance to the besieging army.\n"
