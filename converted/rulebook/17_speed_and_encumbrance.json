A typical item like a sword weighs 1/6 stone. A typical man-sized creature weighs 15 stone (abstractly representing anywhere from 120 and 210 lbs).

You can also use the adjoining table to determine the number of stone encumbering your character.</p>\n<p>When counting items, each weapon, scroll, potion, vial, wand, magic item, or other object counts as an item. Multiple small items sold as a bundle (such as 12 spikes, 6 torches, 20 arrows, etc.) count as one item for this purpose.
