Don’t despair, because you become 1st level when you create your first character, and progress from there! To create a character, follow the eleven steps below:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Break out a new character sheet. You can use the one provided in this book, download and print one of the many fan-made character sheets, or reproduce an existing sheet by hand on a piece of paper. If all else fails, just scribble down notes on scratch paper!</li>\n<li>Roll for your character’s <strong>attributes</strong>, as described below in <strong>Character Attributes</strong>. Write the results after the names of the abilities and record the attribute bonus or penalty for each score. (Some campaigns might use optional rules that change how attributes are rolled. Your Judge will let you know if so.)</li>\n<li>Choose a <strong>character</strong> <strong>class</strong> which suits your character’s abilities from this chapter in the <strong>Character Classes</strong> section. All classes have key attributes (requiring a minimum score of 9), and some classes require that the character have minimum scores for other attributes. Write down the combat characteristics and class powers of your class. Note that, unlike some games, in <em><strong>ACKS</strong></em>a character’s race is part of his class; you do not separately choose a race.</li>\n<li>Note on your character sheet that your character has zero (0) <strong>experience points</strong> (or <strong>XP</strong>); you might also want to note the number needed to advance to second level, as shown in the table for your class. Gaining experience points is explained in the <strong>Adventures</strong> and <strong>Campaigns</strong> chapters.</li>\n<li>Roll <strong>hit points</strong> (<strong>hp</strong>)using the designated die for your class. If you roll 4 or less, treat the result as a 4. Add your Constitution bonus or penalty to the roll and note the result as your hit points on your character sheet. (Some campaigns might use optional rules that change starting hp. Your Judge will let you know if so.)</li>\n<li>Find the appropriate template table for your character’s class,and roll 3d6 on the table to determine your character’s starting <strong>template</strong>. If you don’t like the template you rolled, you can choose a template from a lower roll, but not from a higher roll. Write down the name of the template you settle on.</li>\n<li>Write down your character’s starting <strong>proficiencies</strong> as listed for your template. All characters always begin with the Adventuring proficiency in addition to those listed. Apply any modifiers to your attributes, hit points, attack throws, or saving throws from proficiencies. Write down your character’s proficiency throws.</li>\n<li>If you have chosen to play a caster, write down your repertoire of starting <strong>spells</strong> from your template. If you aren’t playing a spellcaster, skip this step.</li>\n<li>Write your character’s <strong>starting equipment</strong> and gold pieces as listed for your template. Since you now know what armor your character is wearing, what your Dexterity modifier is, and what powers and proficiencies modify your defenses, you can calculate and note your <strong>Armor Class</strong> (<strong>AC</strong>) on the character sheet. Calculate your character’s <strong>encumbrance</strong> based on how much weight he is carrying and use that to determine his four <strong>speeds</strong> (p. XX).</li>\n<li>Decide your character’s <strong>homeland</strong> and whether your character is male or female. (In the Auran Empire campaign setting, some classes are restricted to certain sexes.) Roll for your character’s <strong>starting age</strong> and write down your character’s starting <strong>languages</strong> based on your race. Record your character’s size (<strong>man-sized</strong>) and weight (usually <strong>15 stone</strong>).</li>\n<li>Give your character a name, and create a brief summary of your character’s appearance, background, and personality based on his attributes, class, template, age, and other characteristics. Choose an appropriate <strong>alignment</strong> for your character. Your Judge will have information on the setting of your character’s world that can be helpful in naming your new character and developing his background. He can also advise you on how the characters are coming together to form an <strong>adventuring party</strong>.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Optional Rules for Character Creation</h3>\n<p>Depending on the Judge’s preferences, either or both of the following optional rules might apply.</p>\n<h6>Generating Characters without Templates (Optional)</h6>\n<p>Instead of rolling 3d6 to determine a template, roll 3d6 x 10 to determine your character’s starting gold pieces. Use the gold to select any weapons, armor, and equipment that the Judge says are available. Select your starting proficiencies and (if a caster) starting spells, subject to the Judge’s discretion. This rule is only recommended for experienced players.</p>\n<h6>Generating Multiple Characters (Optional)</h6>\n<p>At the start of play, each player generates five characters and selects one primary and two back-up characters. The remaining two characters are given to the Judge to use as NPCs to populate the campaign setting. If the primary and back-ups are all killed, the player generates five additional characters, again picking three and giving the Judge two**.** This ensures that the player always has a variety of characters to choose from to find one he likes, and gives the Judge some additional NPCs to populate the world.</p>\n<p>The <em><strong>ACKS II Judges Journal</strong></em> has other optional rules for character creation. Be sure to ask your Judge what rules he’s using!</p>\n",
