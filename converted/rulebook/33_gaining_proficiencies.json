0th level characters) begin their careers with four general proficiencies. (In rare cases, 0th level characters might have class proficiencies.) If their Intellect is 13 or greater, they gain additional general proficiencies equal to their Intellect bonus. A character cannot select the same proficiency more than once with his four starting proficiencies, but can use bonus proficiencies from high INT to do so.</p>\n<p>As discussed under Gaining Proficiencies by Time, 0th level NPCs get additional proficiencies with time. Normal humans gain an additional general proficiency after 5 years, 15 years, and 35 years of work. Normal dwarves and elves gain an additional general proficiency after 5, 15, 35, and 70 years of work. Some exceptional 0th level NPCs might train in their downtime to acquire additional general proficiencies faster than 5 – 35 years, as adventurers do (Judge’s discretion).</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: Tavus is a highly intelligent (INT 16) 0th level young man. He begins his career at age 18 with six general proficiencies — four base + two more from his high INT. He selects Craft (Carpenter), Engineering, Labor (Stonecutting), and Mapping with his four starting proficiencies. With his bonus proficiencies he takes two additional ranks in Engineering. At age 23, he gains an additional proficiency, which he uses to take a fourth rank in Engineering. He is now qualified to serve as an Engineer specialist (see <strong>Specialists</strong> in Chapter 4), making him among the youngest engineers in his guild. A character of average Intellect might take a lifetime to gain that same level of proficiency.</p>\n",

Normal humans gain an additional general proficiency after 5 years, 15 years, and 35 years of work. Normal dwarves and elves gain an additional general proficiency after 5, 15, 35, and 70 years of work. Some exceptional 0th level NPCs might train in their downtime to acquire additional general proficiencies faster than 5 – 35 years, as adventurers do (Judge’s discretion).\n\nEXAMPLE: Tavus is a highly intelligent (INT 16) 0th level young man. He begins his career at age 18 with six general proficiencies — four base + two more from his high INT. He selects Craft (Carpenter), Engineering, Labor (Stonecutting), and Mapping with his four starting proficiencies. With his bonus proficiencies he takes two additional ranks in Engineering. At age 23, he gains an additional proficiency, which he uses to take a fourth rank in Engineering. He is now qualified to serve as an Engineer specialist (see **Specialists** in Chapter 4), making him among the youngest engineers in his guild. A character of average Intellect might take a lifetime to gain that same level of proficiency.\n"
