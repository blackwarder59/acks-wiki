Although assassins generally prefer fast, concealable, or quiet weapons, killing can occur under many circumstances. And though they favor stealth over steel for protection, sometimes their work requires them to infiltrate or impersonate bodies of troops.</p>\n<p><strong>Combat Proficiencies:</strong> Assassins have weapon proficiency with all weapons. They have armor proficiency with medium, light, and very light armor. They have fighting style proficiency with all three optional styles (i.e. the dual weapon, two-handed weapon, and weaponand shield styles).</p>\n<p><strong>Combat Progression:</strong> Assassins advance in attack throws and saving throws as fighters, by two points every threelevels of experience. Assassins increase their base damage roll from successful missile and melee attacks by +1 at 1st level and by an additional +1 at 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th level. They can cleave after killing a foe a maximum of once per round per class level.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Assassin (Fighter) Attack and Saving Throws</strong></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Level</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Paralysis</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Death</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Blast</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Implements</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Spells</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Attack Throw</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>13+</td>\n<td>14+</td>\n<td>15+</td>\n<td>16+</td>\n<td>17+</td>\n<td>10+</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2 – 3</td>\n<td>12+</td>\n<td>13+</td>\n<td>14+</td>\n<td>15+</td>\n<td>16+</td>\n<td>9+</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>11+</td>\n<td>12+</td>\n<td>13+</td>\n<td>14+</td>\n<td>15+</td>\n<td>8+</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5 – 6</td>\n<td>10+</td>\n<td>11+</td>\n<td>12+</td>\n<td>13+</td>\n<td>14+</td>\n<td>7+</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>9+</td>\n<td>10+</td>\n<td>11+</td>\n<td>12+</td>\n<td>13+</td>\n<td>6+</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8-9</td>\n<td>8+</td>\n<td>9+</td>\n<td>10+</td>\n<td>11+</td>\n<td>12+</td>\n<td>5+</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>7+</td>\n<td>8+</td>\n<td>9+</td>\n<td>10+</td>\n<td>11+</td>\n<td>4+</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11 – 12</td>\n<td>6+</td>\n<td>7+</td>\n<td>8+</td>\n<td>9+</td>\n<td>10+</td>\n<td>3+</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>5+</td>\n<td>6+</td>\n<td>7+</td>\n<td>8+</td>\n<td>9+</td>\n<td>2+</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>4+</td>\n<td>5+</td>\n<td>6+</td>\n<td>7+</td>\n<td>8+</td>\n<td>1+</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h6>Starting Class Powers</h6>\n<p>At the start of play, assassins have the class powers below. As with thieves, most of the assassin’s skills improve as the assassin gains levels according to the progression on the Assassin Level Progression table. While assassins can wear medium armor, they cannot use their backstabbing, hiding, or sneaking powers unless wearing light armor or less.</p>\n<p><strong>Backstabbing</strong>: Assassins are skilled at treacherously attacking unprepared enemies. An assassin can backstab any <strong>vulnerable</strong> opponent. Backstabs can be made in melee or with missile weapons at short range, but cannot be made with missile weapons at medium or longer range. When backstabbing, an assassin gains a +4 bonus to hit and if the attack succeeds, the assassin deals an additional die of damage at 1st level, and another additional die at 5th, 9th, and 13th level.</p>\n<p><strong>Hiding:</strong> Assassins are trained to skulk unseen in the cover of darkness. An assassin can begin hiding as a combat action anytime he is in cover, dim light, or darkness. When the assassin begins hiding, the Judge must make a Hiding proficiency throw on behalf of the assassin. An assassin will always think he is successful in this skill, and will not know otherwise until others react to his presence. Regardless of whether the throw succeeds, opponents encountering the assassin suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls as long as he remains stationary in cover, dim light, or darkness.</p>\n<p>If the throw succeeds, the assassin is <strong>hidden</strong>. If the throw fails, the assassin is not hidden. No creature can claim line of sight on an assassin that is hidden from it. If a hidden assassin engages an unengaged opponent, the opponent cannot make a free facing change (p. XX). If an opponent knows the hidden assassin’s general location, the opponent can attack him in melee at a -4 penalty, but it cannot even blindly attack the assassin if it doesn’t knows his general location. The hidden condition expires at the end of the assassin’s initiative if he moves or attacks. It also terminates if the cover, dim light, or darkness no longer conceals the assassin from his opponents.</p>\n<p><strong>Shadowy Senses:</strong> Since the bright light of torches will reveal their positions, assassins learn to rely on superior night-vision, keen hearing and smell, and echolocation to slowly scout through dark alleys, lightless dungeons, and star-lit rooftops. When moving at combat speed or exploration speed, an assassin can “see” as if he were carrying a light source that sheds dim light in a 30’ radius. Shadowy senses can be used to fight, probe for traps, and so on. However, shadowy senses cannot be used to discern colors, faces, markings, or flat images (such as frescoes and murals) or to read books, maps, or scrolls. Shadowy senses does not function if the assassin is charging or running, if deafened, or if in an area of magical darkness or magical silence. Because it counts as dim light, an opponent can hide from shadowy senses.</p>\n<p><strong>Sneaking:</strong> Assassins learn to prowl with great stealth. An assassin can begin sneaking as a movement action. He can sneak at his encounter speed or one-half combat speed without penalty. If he moves greater than half his combat speed, he takes a -5 penalty to the Sneaking proficiency throw. If he runs, he takes a -10 penalty.</p>\n<p>When the assassin begins sneaking, the Judge must make a Sneaking proficiency throw on behalf of the assassin. An assassin will always think he is successful in this skill, and will not know otherwise until others react to his presence. Regardless of whether the throw succeeds, opponents encountering the assassin suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls if the assassin is outside their line of sight.</p>\n<p>If the throw succeeds, the assassin is also <strong>sneaking</strong>. If the throw fails, the assassin is not sneaking. When sneaking, the assassin makes no noise when he moves — none whatsoever. Even alert creatures that make a successful Listening proficiency throw will not hear a sound. When a sneaking assassin engages an unengaged opponent from the rear, the opponent cannot make a free facing change.</p>\n<p><strong>Streetwise:</strong> The assassin has learned the hard lessons taught by life as a criminal. He might begin play as a member of an assassin’s guild or other criminal syndicate (Judge’s discretion). He can engage in hijinks if he has the necessary proficiencies or thief skills. He can automatically identify gestures, signs, slang, and territory of criminal organizations in his home settlement. He can identify those of other urban settlements with a proficiency throw of 11+. Secret organizations or organizations in far-off cities might be harder to recognize. (This class power is equivalent to one rank of Streetwise proficiency.)</p>\n<h6>Additional Class Powers</h6>\n<p>When they advance in level, assassins gain the following additional class powers:</p>\n<p><strong>Hideout (9th level):</strong> By acquiring a <strong>hideout</strong> worth at least 5,000gp, the assassin can attract followers to his service. 2d6 1st level assassins will arrive to serve him as followers within 1d4 weeks of him acquiring the hideout. If the assassin already has a hideout, the followers arrive to serve him within 1d4 weeks of him reaching 9th level. If hired, the followers must be paid standard rates for henchmen. These followers will serve the character with some loyalty, though at least one will be an infiltrator working for the assassin’s local rivals, sent to keep an eye on the character. A cunning and resourceful assassin can use these followers to start a criminal syndicate. Additional rules for hideouts and syndicates are detailed in the <strong>Campaigns</strong> chapter.</p>\n<h6>Class Proficiencies</h6>\n<p><strong>Proficiency Progression:</strong> At 1st level, assassins select one class proficiency from their class proficiency list and one general proficiency from the general proficiency list. They select an additional class proficiency at 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th level. They select an additional general proficiency at 5th, 9th, and 13th level.</p>\n<p><strong>Assassin Proficiency List:</strong> Acrobatics, Alchemy, Alertness, Arcane Dabbling, Armor Training, Bribery, Cat Burglary, Climbing, Combat Reflexes, Combat Trickery (disarm, incapacitate), Contortionism, Disguise, Eavesdropping, Fighting Style Specialization, Gambling, Intimidation, Kin-Slaying, Mimicry, Poisoning, Precise Shooting, Running, Skirmishing, Skulking, Sniping, Swashbuckling, Weapon Finesse, Weapon Focus</p>\n<h6>Assassin Templates</h6>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>3d6 Roll</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Template</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Proficiencies</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Starting Equipment</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3 – 4</td>\n<td>Cutthroat</td>\n<td>Combat Reflexes  Gambling</td>\n<td>Hand axe, dagger, leather armor, cheap tunic and pants, leather belt, high boots, backpack, 12 iron spikes, small hammer, flask of military oil, tinderbox, 12 torches, waterskin, 1 week’s iron rations (enc. 5 3/6 st)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5 – 6</td>\n<td>Bounty Hunter</td>\n<td>Combat Trickery (incapacitate)  Tracking</td>\n<td>Bola, serrated sword, dagger, net, leather armor, black cloak, traveler’s tunic and pants, high boots, backpack, crowbar, 50’ rope, manacles, waterskin, 1 week’s iron rations, 2gp (enc. 6 1/6 st)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7 – 8</td>\n<td>Pirate</td>\n<td>Swashbuckling  Seafaring</td>\n<td>Short bow, quiver with 20 arrows, scimitar, well-balanced dagger with boot-sheath, leather armor, colorful tunic and pants, silk sash, high boots, 50’ rope, grappling hook, waterskin, 1 week’s iron rations (enc. 5 st)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9 – 10</td>\n<td>Bravo</td>\n<td>Fighting Style Spec.

A barbarian gains a +1 bonus to initiative and a +1 bonus to avoid surprise.</p>\n<p><strong>Natural Proficiency:</strong> Depending on his region of origin, every barbarian possesses natural proficiencies in a particular area. These are bonus proficiencies that do not count against the barbarian’s normal selections.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Barbarians from Jutland gain Climbing and Seafaring proficiencies.</li>\n<li>Barbarians from Skysostan gain Precise Shooting and Riding proficiencies.</li>\n<li>Barbarians from the Ivory Kingdoms gain Running and Endurance proficiencies.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Judge might devise other natural proficiencies for other barbarian regions in his own setting.</p>\n<p><strong>Natural Stealth:</strong> As hunters and raiders by trade, barbarians are naturally sneaky. Opponents suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls when encountering a barbarian approaching from outside line of sight or lying in wait in cover or darkness.</p>\n<p><strong>Savage Resilience:</strong> The healers and priests of civilized lands are foreign to barbarians, who rely on their <strong>savage resilience</strong> to survive. When a barbarian is required to consult the Mortal Woundstable, the player can roll twice and choose the preferred result to apply. Barbarians also subtract their class level from the number of days of bed rest required to recover.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: Sigwulf, a 4th level Barbarian with 16 CON and 24 hp, is reduced to -7 hp. When a friend treats his wounds, Sigwulf rolls on the Mortal Wounds table. He rolls 1d20 and 1d6 twice, and scores a modified 17/2 and an 11/6. An 11/6 results in the loss of 1d6 teeth, while 17/2 results in loss of genitals; the players opts for the 11/6 result and consigns 1d6 of Sigwulf’s teeth to oblivion. Although normally 1 week’s bed rest is required to recover from a result of 11 (critically wounded), this is reduced to just 3 days because of Sigwulf’s class level.</p>\n<h6>Additional Class Powers</h6>\n<p>When they advance in level, barbarians gain the following additional class powers:</p>\n<p><strong>Animal Magnetism (5th level)</strong>: The barbarian has become a formidable presence who inspires those who follow him. Any henchmen and mercenaries hired by the barbarian gain a +1 bonus to their morale score whenever he personally leads them. This bonus stacks with any modifiers from the barbarian’s Charisma or proficiencies.</p>\n<p><strong>Chieftain’s Hall (9th level):</strong> By acquiring a <strong>chieftain’s hall</strong> worth at least 15,000gp, the barbarian can attract followers to his service. 5d6 x 10 0th level troops and 1d6 barbarians of 1st – 3rd level arrive to serve him within 1d3 months of him acquiring the chieftain’s hall. If the barbarian already has a chieftain’s hall, the followers arrive to serve him within 1d3 months of him reaching 9th level. The barbarian must pay his followers the ordinary rates for mercenaries and henchmen or they leave his service.

As with thieves, some of the bard’s throws improve as he gains levels according to the progression shown on the Bard Level Progression table.</p>\n<p><strong>Arcane Dabbling:</strong> Bards are prone to dabble in the arcane. They can attempt to use wands, staffs, and other magic items only usable by arcane casters. The bard does not need to know the command word for the item, but he must make a proficiency throw of 4+ on 1d20 or the attempt backfires in some desultory way (Judge’s discretion).</p>\n<p><strong>Inspire Courage:</strong> By reciting heroic lays and epic poems, bards can improve the effectiveness of their allies. Inspiring courage requires a few moments of oration before a battle (one round), and makes up to 30 of the bard’s allies within a 50’ radius <strong>inspired</strong>. An inspired creature gains a +1 bonus to attack throws, armor class, morale rolls (for monsters or NPCs allied with the caster), and saving throws against magical <strong>fear</strong>. The bonus lasts for 10 minutes (1 turn). A bard can inspire courage once per day per class level. (Even the most inspired epic gets stale if you hear it twice in the same day.) A bard cannot inspire courage on characters who are already <strong>engaged</strong> in combat.</p>\n<p><strong>Jack of All Trades:</strong> Being habitually curious jacks-of-all-trades, bards pick up an array of skills that vary widely. The bard can learn a class proficiency from any class; a thief skill (excluding backstab); a venturer class power (excluding mercantile network); or other class power approved by the Judge, excluding spellcasting powers. The bard cannot select a class power when the bard’s class level is lower than the class level at which that power becomes available to its default class. For instance, he could not select Rumormongering at 1st level because it doesn’t become available to venturers until 4th level. Note that some selections might not be useful; e.g. the bard has no spells to regain with Contemplation, so that proficiency isn’t ever a good choice.</p>\n<p><strong>Listening:</strong> Bards have sharp ears that permit them to hear noises in caves, hallways, at a door, or other locations. The Judge makes a Listening proficiency throw in secret on behalf of the bard. If the throw succeeds, he hears any noises in earshot. If the throw fails, or if there aren’t any noises in earshot, he doesn’t hear anything. The bard must be quiet and must be the closest creature in the party relative to the location of the sound or suspected sound. Listening only requires one round but can only be undertaken once per turn (10 minutes) if the party is moving at all, because it takes time for people to settle down into quiet.</p>\n<p><strong>Loremastery:</strong> The bard can make a proficiency throw of 18+ to decipher occult runes, remember ancient history, or identify a historic artifact or special monster part. The proficiency throw required reduces by 1 per level. He can also identify magic items as if he were a 5th level mage. (This class power is the equivalent of Loremastery proficiency.)</p>\n<p><strong>Multilingual:</strong> Because they travel widely and converse freely, bards become conversant in a wide variety of tongues. They gain three bonus languages. The bard can select some or all of these languages immediately from among those in common use in the campaign’s starting region or select them later from among those he encounters in play. (This class power is the equivalent of one rank of Language proficiency.)</p>\n<p><strong>Performance:</strong> The bard has been trained in a performing art such as chanting, reciting poetry, singing, or playing an instrument. He can earn 10gp per month from working as a street performer or tavern entertainer. He can identify renowned performers, famous works, and unusual songs with a proficiency throw of 11+. (This class power is equivalent to one rank of Performance proficiency.)</p>\n<h6>Additional Class Powers</h6>\n<p><strong>Jack of All Trades II (3rd level):</strong> The bard can learn another class proficiency from any class, thief skill (excluding backstab), venturer class power (excluding mercantile network), or other class power approved by the Judge, excluding spellcasting.</p>\n<p><strong>Deciphering (4th level</strong><strong>):</strong> The bard gains the ability to decipher text(including ciphers, treasure maps, and dead languages, but not magical writings). Deciphering a page of text requires one turn (10 minutes) and a successful proficiency throw of 4+ on 1d20. If the roll does not succeed, the bard cannot try to decipher that particular page of text until he reaches a higher level of experience.</p>\n<p><strong>Chronicles of Battle (5th):</strong> The bard’s songs and stories inspire his hirelings to strive for glory. Any henchmen and mercenaries hired by the bard gain a +1 bonus to their morale score while the bard is present to witness and record their deeds. This bonus stacks with any modifiers from the bard’s Charisma or proficiencies.</p>\n<p><strong>Jack of All Trades III (6th level):</strong> The bard can learn another class proficiency from any class, thief skill (excluding backstab), venturer class power (excluding mercantile network), or other class power approved by the Judge, excluding spellcasting.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Max HP</td>\n<td>Temp HP Gained</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1 – 3</td>\n<td>1d2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4 – 9</td>\n<td>1d3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10 – 16</td>\n<td>1d4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17 – 23</td>\n<td>1d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>24 – 29</td>\n<td>1d8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>30 – 36</td>\n<td>1d10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>37 – 49</td>\n<td>2d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>50 – 63</td>\n<td>2d8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>64 – 76</td>\n<td>2d10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>77 – 89</td>\n<td>2d12</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>90 – 110</td>\n<td>3d10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>111 – 140</td>\n<td>4d10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>141 – 170</td>\n<td>5d10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>171+</td>\n<td>6d10, plus 1d10  per 30 hp past 170</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Inspire Hope (7th):</strong> By recounting the glorious deeds of old, bards can brighten the darkest moment. Inspiring hope requires a few moments of oration (one round), and grants up to 30 of the bard’s allies within 30’ a pool of temporary hit points. The number of hit points gained by each ally is determined on the adjoining table based on the bard’s or the ally’s max hit points (whichever is lower). These temporary hit points last for one turn (10 minutes), until lost to damage, or until the bard inspires hope on the ally again, whichever comes first. The bard can inspire hope once per day at 7th level, and one additional time per day with each level thereafter.</p>\n<p><strong>Jack of All Trades IV (8th level):</strong> The bard can learn another class proficiency from any class, thief skill (excluding backstab), venturer class power (excluding mercantile network), or other class power approved by the Judge, excluding spellcasting.</p>\n<p><strong>Great Hall (9th level):</strong> By acquiring a <strong>great hall</strong> worth at least 15,000gp, the bard can attract followers to his service. 5d6 x 10 0th level troops and 1d6 bards of 1st – 3rd level arrive to serve him within 1d3 months of him acquiring the hall. If the bard already has a hall, the followers arrive to serve him within 1d3 months of him reaching 9th level. The bard must pay his followers the ordinary rates for mercenaries and henchmen or they leave his service. Additional rules for great halls are detailed in the <strong>Campaigns</strong> chapter.</p>\n<p><strong>Scrollreading (10th):</strong> The bard gains the ability to read and cast magic from arcane and divine scrolls. The bard does not have to be able to read the language in which the scroll is written provided he has successfully deciphered it before. Reading a magical scroll requires one round and a successful proficiency throw of 4+ on 1d20. However, a failed throw means the spell does not function as expected, and can create a horrible effect at the Judge’s discretion.</p>\n<p><strong>Jack of All Trades V (11th level):</strong> The bard can learn another class proficiency from any class, thief skill (excluding backstab), venturer class power (excluding mercantile network), or other class power approved by the Judge, excluding spellcasting.</p>\n<h6>Class Proficiencies</h6>\n<p><strong>Proficiency Progression:</strong> At 1st level, bards select one class proficiency from their class proficiency list and one general proficiency from the general proficiency list. They select an additional class proficiency at 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th level. They select an additional general proficiency at 5th, 9th, and 13th level.</p>\n<p><strong>Bard Proficiency List:</strong> Acrobatics, Bargaining, Beast Friendship, Bribery, Combat Trickery (disarm), Command, Diplomacy, Disguise, Elven Bloodline, Fighting Style Specialization, Healing, Knowledge, Language, Leadership, Lip Reading, Magical Engineering, Magical Music, Mimicry, Mystic Aura, Performance, Precise Shooting, Prestidigitation, Running, Seduction, Skirmishing, Swashbuckling, Weapon Finesse, Weapon Focus</p>\n<h6>Bard Templates</h6>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>3d6 Roll</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Template</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Proficiencies</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Starting Equipment</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3 – 4</td>\n<td>Woodland Piper</td>\n<td>Beast Friendship  Naturalism  <strong>Performance (instruments)</strong>  <strong>Familiar</strong></td>\n<td>2 javelins, hide armor, leather shoes, leather belt, belt pouch, pan pipes, waterskin, 1 week’s iron rations, 1gp (enc. 2 5/6 st)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5 – 6</td>\n<td>Hedge Magician</td>\n<td>Prestidigitation  Alchemy  <strong>Performance (oration)</strong>  <strong>Soothsaying</strong></td>\n<td>Quarterstaff, leather armor under mage’s cassock, cloak with embroidered sigils, fancy silver sash, low boots, 2 small sacks, 2 tallow candles, tinderbox, 1 pint of rare wine in potion vial, leather-bound spellbook (blank), waterskin, 1 week’s iron rations, 2gp (enc. 5 4/6 st)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7 – 8</td>\n<td>Swashbuckler</td>\n<td>Swashbuckling  Seafaring  <strong>Performance (singing)</strong>  <strong>Fighting Style Specialization (dual weapons)</strong></td>\n<td>Short bow, quiver with 20 arrows, scimitar, well-balanced dagger with boot-sheath, leather armor, colorful tunic and pants, bright silk girdle, high boots, 50’ rope, grappling hook, waterskin, 1 week’s iron rations (enc. 6 st)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9 – 10</td>\n<td>Wandering Minstrel</td>\n<td>Magical Music  Diplomacy  <strong>Performance (instruments)</strong>  <strong>Precise Shooting</strong></td>\n<td>Crossbow, case with 20 bolts, short sword, dagger, well-maintained leather armor, traveler’s tunic and pants, embossed belt, sturdy low boots, belt pouch, small sack, lute, waterskin, 1 weeks’ iron rations (enc. 4 2/6 st)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11 – 12</td>\n<td>Historian</td>\n<td>Magical Engineering  Knowledge (history) <strong>Performance (epic poetry)</strong>  <strong>Bright Lore of Aura</strong></td>\n<td>Crossbow, case with 20 bolts, short sword, dagger, well-maintained laminated linen armor, traveler’s tunic and pants, polished high boots, backpack, parchment journal half-filled with entries, quill and ink, waterskin, 1 week’s iron rations, 6gp (enc. 6 2/6 st)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13 – 14</td>\n<td>Beguiler</td>\n<td>Mystic Aura  Seduction  <strong>Performance (singing)</strong>  <strong>Treachery (Venturer)</strong></td>\n<td>Crossbow, case with 20 bolts, sword, polished chain mail armor, flamboyant fur-lined cloak, fancy tunic and pants, long leather gloves, high boots, bright silk sash, purse, belt pouch, waterskin, 2 weeks’ iron rations, 10gp (enc. 7 st)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15 – 16</td>\n<td>Spy</td>\n<td>Disguise  Streetwise  <strong>Performance (acting)</strong>  <strong>Hiding (Thief)</strong></td>\n<td>Crossbow, case with 20 bolts, short sword, dagger, unmarked leather armor, simple hooded cloak, traveler’s tunic and pants, embossed belt, low boots, backpack, disguise kit, crowbar, 50’ rope, waterskin, 1 week’s iron rations, 56gp for bribes (enc. 6 2/6 st)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17 – 18</td>\n<td>Aristocrat</td>\n<td>Command  Leadership  <strong>Performance (oration)</strong>  <strong>Armor Training (heavy)</strong></td>\n<td>Matching sword and dagger with lacquered hilts, exquisitely made plate armor, shield, fur-lined cloak, armiger’s tunic and pants, high boots, medium riding horse, riding saddle and tack, 2 leather saddlebags, waterskin, 1 week’s iron rations, 10gp (enc. 6 2/6 st with rations on horse)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Notes:</strong> The Performance proficiency and Jack of All Trades ability that each bard template begins with is noted in bold.

A fully trained bladedancer is highly coveted as a bodyguard and escort by the great noble houses.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Bladedancer Level Progression</strong></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td><strong>Bladedancer Spell Progression</strong></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Experience</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Title</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Level</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Hit Dice</strong></td>\n<td><strong>AC Bonus</strong></td>\n<td></td>\n<td><strong>1</strong></td>\n<td><strong>2</strong></td>\n<td><strong>3</strong></td>\n<td><strong>4</strong></td>\n<td><strong>5</strong></td>\n<td><strong>6</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>Blade-Initiate</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1d6</td>\n<td>+1</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1,500</td>\n<td>Blade-Daughter</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2d6</td>\n<td>+1</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3,000</td>\n<td>Blade-Singer</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3d6</td>\n<td>+1</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6,000</td>\n<td>Blade-Weaver</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4d6</td>\n<td>+1</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12,000</td>\n<td>Blade-Sister</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>5d6</td>\n<td>+1</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>24,000</td>\n<td>Blade-Adept</td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>6d6</td>\n<td>+1</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>50,000</td>\n<td>Blade-Dancer</td>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>7d6</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>100,000</td>\n<td>Blade-Priestess</td>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>8d6</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>200,000</td>\n<td>Blade-Mistress</td>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>9d6</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>300,000</td>\n<td>Blade-Mistress, 10th level</td>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>9d6 + 1*</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>400,000</td>\n<td>Blade-Mistress, 11th level</td>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>9d6 + 2*</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>500,000</td>\n<td>Blade-Mistress, 12th level</td>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>9d6 + 3*</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>600,000</td>\n<td>Blade-Mistress, 13th level</td>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>9d6 + 4*</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>700,000</td>\n<td>Mistress of All Blades</td>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>9d6 + 5*</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>*No adjustment from Constitution applies to this flat bonus.</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h6>Combat Characteristics</h6>\n<p>Bladedancers are skilled combatants trained in the graceful fighting style that gives them their name.</p>\n<p><strong>Armor and Weapons:</strong> Bladedancers have weapon proficiency with all swords (including daggers, short swords, swords, and two-handed swords) and all spears (including lances, javelins, polearms, and spears). They have armor proficiency with light and very light armor. They have fighting style proficiency with the dual weapon and two-handed weapon styles, but not with the weapon and shield style.</p>\n<p><strong>Combat Progression:</strong> At first level, bladedancers hit an unarmored foe (AC 0) with an attack throw of 10+. They advance like crusaders in attack throws and saving throws, by two points every four levels of experience. They do not gain any bonus to damage as they advance in level.

If a bladedancer is wearing light armor, very light armor, or no armor, and carrying 5 stones or less encumbrance, she gains a +1 bonus to initiative and a +1 bonus to Armor Class. At 7th level, the AC bonus increases to +2, and at 13th level the AC bonus increases to +3.</p>\n<p>Graceful fighting can be stacked with Swashbuckling proficiency to increase the AC bonus, but the bonus from Swashbuckling is capped at +1 unless the bladedancer is unarmored.</p>\n<p><strong>Divine Magic:</strong> Bladedancers can manifest their goddess’s power in the form of divine spells, which are granted through prayer and worship. The number and levels of spells the bladedancer can cast in a single day are listed on the Bladedancer Spell Progression table. The bladedancer’s spell selection is limited to the spells in her order’s <strong>repertoire</strong> (which is different than that of the crusader). See the <strong>Spells</strong> chapter for a list of all available spells.</p>\n<p><strong>Strength of Faith:</strong> When the bladedancer strikes a foe, the goddess lends her strength to the blow. The bladedancer can apply her WIL modifier instead of her STR modifier on any damage roll affected by STR.</p>\n<p><strong>Theology:</strong> Every bladedancer receives religious instruction at an abbey, cloister, or temple. She can begin play as a member of a religious hierarchy (Judge’s discretion). She can acquire congregants through proselytizing. She can automatically identify religious symbols, spell signatures, trappings, and holy days of her own faith, and can recognize those of other faiths with a proficiency throw of 11+. Rare or occult cults might be harder to recognize. (This class power is the equivalent of one rank of Theology proficiency.)</p>\n<p><strong>Weapon Finesse:</strong> Bladedancers fight with lissome speed and cat-like agility. A bladedancer can apply her DEX modifier instead of her STR modifier on her melee attack throws when using weapons with which she is proficient. (This class power is the equivalent of Weapon Finesse proficiency, except that it applies to the bladedancer’s specific weapons rather than to all tiny, small, or medium weapons. It cannot stack with Weapon Finesse.)</p>\n<h6>Additional Class Powers</h6>\n<p>When they advance in level, bladedancers gain the following additional class powers:</p>\n<p><strong>Minor Magical Research (5th):</strong> The bladedancer can scribe scrolls and brew potions.</p>\n<p><strong>Major Magical Research (9th):</strong> The bladedancer can create permanent magic items such as enchanted armor, rings, or weapons.</p>\n<p><strong>Temple (9th level):</strong> By acquiring a <strong>temple</strong> worth at least 15,000gp, the bladedancer can attract followers to her service. So long as the bladedancer is currently in favor with her goddess, she can buy or build her temple at half the normal price due to miraculous assistance. 5d6 x 10 0th level troops and 1d6 bladedancers of 1st level of the same religion arrive to serve her within 1d3 months of her acquiring the temple. If the bladedancer has already acquired a temple, the followers arrive to serve her within 1d3 months of her reaching 9th level. The followers are fanatically brave and completely loyal (loyalty +4 and morale +4). Despite their loyalty, the followers must be paid a fair wage or they might eventually leave the bladedancer’s service. Additional rules for temples are detailed in the <strong>Campaigns</strong> chapter.</p>\n<p><strong>Supreme Magical Research (11th level):</strong> The bladedancer can learn and cast ritual divine spells of great power (7th, 8th, and 9th level) and craft magical constructs. If chaotic, the bladedancer can create necromantic servants and become undead. Rules for magic research can be found in the <strong>Campaigns</strong> chapter (p. XX).</p>\n<h6>Code of Behavior</h6>\n<p>Like crusaders, bladedancers must uphold the strictures of their order and their goddess. If the Judge has not specified particular religious orders in his campaign, the default bladedancer is assumed to be from the Temple of the Blade and Veil, the order devoted to Ianna, Goddess of Love and War. The strictures of their order are many.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The bladedancer must always carry a weapon on her person, except where imperial or sacred law forbids it.</li>\n<li>The bladedancer must offer prayers to Ianna at either dawn or dusk. Offering prayers requires one hour (6 turns).</li>\n<li>The bladedancer must not debase herself by fighting with the implements of the peasantry such as axes and hammers, by dishonorably firing bows or slings from a distance, or by resorting to shields for defense. (She can, however, hurl javelins or spears she carries.)</li>\n<li>The bladedancer must not get married or have children before she reaches the rank of Blade-Dancer (7th level). She needn’t remain chaste, however, and may have liaisons as desired.</li>\n<li>The bladedancer must not use her divine magic for unlawful or chaotic purposes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If a bladedancer ever falls from favor, due to violating the strictures of her faith, the goddess can impose penalties upon the bladedancer. As with crusaders, these penalties are entirely up to the Judge.</p>\n<h6>Class Proficiencies</h6>\n<p><strong>Proficiency Progression:</strong> At 1st level, bladedancers select one class proficiency from their class proficiency list and one general proficiency from the general proficiency list. They select an additional class proficiency at 4th, 8th, and 12th level.

Wherever the forces of Chaos marshal to threaten man, paladins can be found, battling back the darkness with courage and steel. In the Auran Empire, paladins are, like crusaders, members of holy militant orders. Unlike the crusaders’ orders, which are dedicated to the service of particular Empyrean deities, the paladins’ orders are dedicated to the deified emperors, heroes, and prophets of Aura. The largest such order is the Knights of the Winged Sun, who hold as their patron the exalted hero-king Valerian Bellësareus.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Paladin Level Progression</strong></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Experience</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Title</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Level</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Hit Dice</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Melee Damage Bonus</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>Bulwark</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1d8</td>\n<td>+1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2,750</td>\n<td>Warder</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2d8</td>\n<td>+1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5,500</td>\n<td>Defender</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3d8</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11,000</td>\n<td>Protector</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4d8</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>22,000</td>\n<td>Guardian</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>5d8</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>44,000</td>\n<td>Sentinel</td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>6d8</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>90,000</td>\n<td>Justiciar</td>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>7d8</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>180,000</td>\n<td>Paladin</td>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>8d8</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>300,000</td>\n<td>Paladin Lord</td>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>9d8</td>\n<td>+4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>420,000</td>\n<td>Paladin Lord, 10th level</td>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>9d8 + 2*</td>\n<td>+4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>540,000</td>\n<td>Paladin Lord, 11th level</td>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>9d8 + 4*</td>\n<td>+4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>660,000</td>\n<td>Paladin Lord, 12th level</td>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>9d8 + 6*</td>\n<td>+5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>780,000</td>\n<td>Paladin Lord, 13th level</td>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>9d8 + 8*</td>\n<td>+5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>900,000</td>\n<td>Lord Protector</td>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>9d8 + 10*</td>\n<td>+5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>*No adjustment from Constitution applies to this flat bonus.</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h6>Combat Characteristics</h6>\n<p>Paladins are highly trained combatants specialized in fighting as heavy infantry and heavy cavalry.

At the start of play, paladins have the following class powers:</p>\n<p><strong>Aura of Protection:</strong> Paladins are protected by a magical aura that grants them a +1 bonus to AC and a +1 bonus to saving throws against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures. The paladin’s aura of protection appears as a golden halo when viewed with <em>discern good, discern magic,</em> or <em>true seeing.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Lay on Hands:</strong> By calling on the higher powers of Law, the paladin can lay on hands to heal injuries. If he lays hands on a wounded creature, he can restore 2 hit points per experience level. If he lays hands on an incapacitated creature, he can grant a bonus to their Mortal Wounds throw of one-half his class level (round up). If he lays hands on a paralyzed creature, he can cure the paralysis. The paladin can use his power to lay on hands once per day. He can select the Laying on Hands proficiency to gain additional uses of the power per day. (This class power is the equivalent of one rank of Laying on Hands proficiency).</p>\n<p><strong>Manual of Arms:</strong> The paladin is highly experienced in military discipline, physical fitness, and weapon drill. He can automatically identify the battle standards, equipment, great captains, military slang, and rank insignia of his homeland. He can identify those of other realms with a proficiency throw of 11+. He can fight as a regular (rather than irregular) troop in formed and loose units. He can begin play as a member of a legion, mercenary’s guild, or other military organization (Judge’s discretion). (This class power is equivalent to one rank of the Manual of Arms proficiency.)</p>\n<p><strong>Sanctified Body:</strong> Paladins are completely immune to the ravages of disease, including magical diseases. This enables them to go on long crusades without succumbing to the illnesses that kill many soldiers, as well as to face dread foes such as mummies or werewolves without fear of corruption. (This class power is the equivalent of the Divine Health proficiency.)</p>\n<p><strong>Sense Evil:</strong> The paladin can detect creatures with evil intentions, magic items with evil enchantments, sinkholes of evil, enchanted creatures of Chaotic alignment, incarnations of Chaotic alignment, and undead within 45’. Other types of creatures, even if Chaotic, are not detected unless they have actively evil intentions against the paladin. Poisons, physical traps, and natural animals are neither good nor evil, so they are not detected by this spell. The paladin sees the evil creatures or objects with a sinister red glow around them, but the glow cannot be seen by anyone else. The paladin must have line of sight on the evil (e.g. the power does not work through walls). If the creature or object is hidden or invisible, the paladin will only see the glow and not the source of the evil. Sensing evil requires one full round of quiet concentration to activate. The effect lasts as long as the paladin continues to concentrate, to a maximum of one round per level. The effect can be used once per turn (10 minutes). (This class power is the equivalent of the Sensing Evil proficiency.)</p>\n<h6>Additional Class Powers</h6>\n<p>When they advance in level, paladins gain the following additional class powers:</p>\n<p><strong>Holy Fervor (5th level):</strong> The paladin’s presence inspires troops he leads. Any hirelings of the same religion as the paladin gain a +1 bonus to their morale score whenever he personally leads them. This bonus stacks with any modifiers from the paladin’s Charisma or proficiencies.</p>\n<p><strong>Fortress (9th level):</strong> By acquiring a <strong>fortress</strong> or other stronghold worth at least 15,000gp, the paladin can attract followers to his service. 5d6 x 10 0th level troops and 1d6 paladins of 1st – 3rd level arrive to serve him within 1d3 months of him acquiring the fortress. If the paladin already has a fortress, the followers arrive to serve him within 1d3 months of him reaching 9th level. The paladin must pay his followers the ordinary rates for mercenaries and henchmen or they leave his service. In time, the paladin might become a great lord, commanding armies to conquer vast realms. Additional rules for fortresses are detailed in the <strong>Campaigns</strong> chapter (p.

Priestesses of goddesses other than Mityara might replace the Consolation, Diplomacy, Lay on Hands, and Purity of the Body class powers with other abilities (Judge’s discretion).</p>\n<p><strong>Consolation</strong>: The priestess can console the faithful to better endure pain and suffering while they heal. Each use of the ability requires 1 turn (10 minutes), during which the target creature is reassured through prayer and pastoral guidance. Once consoled, the creature’s natural healing from resting is doubled for the next day. The priestess cannot console wounded creatures of a different alignment or religion, nor can she console creatures that aren’t sapient. This ability only applies to healing from resting.</p>\n<p><strong>Diplomacy:</strong> In order to carry out missionary work, priestesses are trained in the art of protocol. They receive a +1 bonus on all reaction rolls when they attempt to parley with intelligent creatures. (This class power is equivalent to one rank of Diplomacy proficiency.)</p>\n<p><strong>Divine Magic:</strong> Priestesses can manifest their goddess’s power in the form of divine spells, which are granted through prayer and worship. The number and levels of spells the priestess can cast in a single day are listed on the Priestess Spell Progression table. The priestess’s spell selection is limited to the spells in her order’s <strong>repertoire</strong> (which is different than that of the crusader). See the <strong>Spells</strong> chapter for a list of all available spells.</p>\n<p><strong>Lay on Hands:</strong> By calling on her goddess, the priestess can lay on hands to heal injuries. If she lays hands on a wounded creature, she can restore 2 hit points per experience level. If she lays hands on an incapacitated creature, she can grant a bonus to their Mortal Wounds throw of one-half his class level (round up). If she lays hands on a paralyzed creature, she can cure the paralysis. The priestess can use her power to lay on hands once per day. She can select the Laying on Hands proficiency to gain additional uses of the power per day. (This class power is the equivalent of one rank of Laying on Hands proficiency).</p>\n<p><strong>Purity of the Body:</strong> The goddess shelters her priestesses from the effects of pestilence, so they can better minister to the sick and dying. The priestess is immune to all forms of disease, including magical diseases caused by spells, mummies, or lycanthropes.</p>\n<p><strong>Theology:</strong> Every priestess receives religious instruction at an abbey, cloister, or temple. She can begin play as a member of a religious hierarchy (Judge’s discretion). She can acquire congregants through proselytizing. She can automatically identify religious symbols, spell signatures, trappings, and holy days of her own faith, and can recognize those of other faiths with a proficiency throw of 11+. Rare or occult cults might be harder to recognize. (This class power is the equivalent of one rank of Theology proficiency).</p>\n<h6>Additional Class Powers</h6>\n<p>When they advance in level, priestesses gain the following additional class powers:</p>\n<p><strong>Minor Magical Research (5th level):</strong> The priestess can scribe magical scrolls and brew potions.</p>\n<p><strong>Cloister (9th level):</strong> By acquiring a cloister worth at least 15,000gp, the priestess can attract followers to her service. If the priestess has had a good and noble adventuring career, the matriarch of her current cloister will pay for up to 15,000gp of the construction costs, provided that the new cloister remains a branch of the older cloister until the priestess reaches 12th level (at which time it will become independent). 1d2 x 10 1st level priestesses and 1d6 x 30 normal women who want to become priestesses arrive within 1d3 months of her acquiring the cloister. If the priestess has already established a cloister, the followers arrive within 1d3 months of her reaching 9th level. Every year, 80% of the previous year’s trainees will leave in frustration or find they lack the discipline for a life of faith, but 1d6 x 20 normal women will arrive to replace them. A normal woman in training typically takes 2 years to become a 1st level priestess. Additional rules for cloisters are detailed in the <strong>Campaigns</strong> chapter.</p>\n<p><strong>Major Magical Research (9th level):</strong> The priestess can create more powerful magic items such as weapons, rings, and staffs.</p>\n<p><strong>Supreme Magical Research (11th level):</strong> The priestess can learn and cast ritual divine spells of great power (7th, 8th, and 9th level) and craft magical constructs. If chaotic, the priestess can create necromantic servants and become undead. Rules for magic research can be found in the <strong>Campaigns</strong> chapter (p. XX).</p>\n<h6>Code of Behavior</h6>\n<p>Like crusaders, priestesses must uphold the strictures of their order and their goddess. If the Judge has not specified particular religious orders in his campaign, the default priestess is assumed to be from the Keepers of the Hearth Fire, the order devoted to Mityara, Goddess of Civilization and Mercy. The strictures of their order are many.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The priestess must always wear the white mantles and shawls of their order when in public.</li>\n<li>The priestess must offer prayers to Mityara at dusk. Offering prayers requires one hour (6 turns).</li>\n<li>Every seventh day, the priestess must keep a flame lit throughout the night, representing the light of civilization.</li>\n<li>The priestess must refrain from the taking of human or demi-human life by any means. (Of course, beastmen, undead, and other monsters are abominations and should be put down!)</li>\n<li>The priestess must remain both chaste and celibate until she reaches the rank of Mother (7th level).</li>\n<li>The priestess must not use her divine magic for unlawful or chaotic purposes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If a priestess ever falls from favor, due to violating the strictures of her faith, the goddess might impose penalties upon the priestess. As with crusaders, these penalties are entirely up to the Judge.</p>\n<h6>Class Proficiencies</h6>\n<p><strong>Proficiency Progression:</strong> At 1st level, priestesses select one class proficiency from their class proficiency list and one general proficiency from the general proficiency list. They select an additional class proficiency at 4th, 8th, and 12th level.

A shaman is responsible for the sacred needs of his tribe, mediating with the tribe’s ancestral spirits and totem animals, and conducting the tribe’s religious rituals. Through his relationship with sacred powers such as gods, powerful ancestors, and animal spirits, the shaman can heal the sick and afflicted, divine wise courses of action, and smite the enemies of his tribe. In the Auran Empire, members of the class might be druids of Rorn, rune-casters of Jutland, medicine men of the Skysos horse peoples, or witch doctors of the Ivory Kingdoms. While most shamans spend their entire lives with their tribe, some shamans are called to adventure by dreams and visions; others adventure out of a desire to learn secrets unavailable in their homelands. A few tragic shamans become adventures to gain the power necessary to avenge the destruction of their tribe.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Shaman Level Progression</strong></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td><strong>Shaman Spell Progression</strong></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Experience</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Title</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Level</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Hit Dice</strong></td>\n<td><strong>1</strong></td>\n<td><strong>2</strong></td>\n<td><strong>3</strong></td>\n<td><strong>4</strong></td>\n<td><strong>5</strong></td>\n<td><strong>6</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>Spirit Whisperer</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1d6</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1,500</td>\n<td>Village Healer</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2d6</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3,000</td>\n<td>Tribal Priest</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3d6</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6,000</td>\n<td>Medicine Man</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4d6</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12,000</td>\n<td>Totem Bearer</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>5d6</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>24,000</td>\n<td>Witch Doctor</td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>6d6</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>50,000</td>\n<td>Spirit Walker</td>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>7d6</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>100,000</td>\n<td>Tribal Elder</td>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>8d6</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>200,000</td>\n<td>Shaman</td>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>9d6</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>300,000</td>\n<td>Shaman, 10th level</td>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>9d6 + 1*</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>400,000</td>\n<td>Shaman, 11th level</td>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>9d6 + 2*</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>500,000</td>\n<td>Shaman, 12th level</td>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>9d6 + 3*</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>600,000</td>\n<td>Shaman, 13th level</td>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>9d6 + 4*</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>700,000</td>\n<td>Grandfather of Totems</td>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>9d6 + 5*</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>*No adjustment from Constitution applies to this flat bonus.</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h6>Combat Characteristics</h6>\n<p>Shamans are skilled combatants, albeit not as good as fighters.

When using this power, he can choose between the ancestral spirits of his tribe, or the natural spirits of his current location. The spirits will answer three yes-or-no questions to the best of their ability. They are very wise regarding their tribal history or local area, but not omniscient, so they might not be able to answer some questions accurately. Such details are left to the Judge’s discretion. The ritual to commune with the ancestor spirits takes 1 turn to complete, during which time the shaman is “out of body” and entirely helpless. The ritual is so taxing that it can be performed but once per week. Once a year, on a particular sacred day (determined by the Judge), the shaman can ask twice the normal number of questions of his ancestors without angering them. Communing with the spirits in a sinkhole of evil is a dangerous and chaotic act that might violate his code of behavior or put him at risk of haunting or possession (Judge’s discretion).</p>\n<p><strong>Divine Magic:</strong> Shamans can manifest the power of their tribal gods and spirits in the form of divine spells, which are granted through prayer and worship. The number and levels of spells the shaman can cast in a single day are listed on the Shaman Spell Progression table. The shaman’s spell selection is limited to the spells in his order’s <strong>repertoire</strong> (which is different than that of the crusader). See the <strong>Spells</strong> chapter for a list of all available spells.</p>\n<p><strong>Tribal Traditions:</strong> Every shaman receives instruction in the sacred rites and religious traditions of his tribe. He can begin play as a shaman of an existing tribe in the region (Judge’s discretion). He can acquire congregants through proselytizing. He can automatically identify religious symbols, spell signatures, trappings, and holy days of his own tribal traditions, and can recognize those of other faiths with a proficiency throw of 11+. Rare or occult cults might be harder to recognize. (This class power is equivalent to one rank of Theology proficiency).</p>\n<p><strong>Totem Animal:</strong> Every shaman has a <strong>totem animal</strong> as a companion. The totem animal physically represents the shaman’s relationship with his sacred powers. The Totem Animals table, below, lists the benefits and abilities of several sample totems. The Judge can create additional totems at his discretion. The totem animal should be a creature appropriate to the character’s attributes and tribal traditions. For example, a shaman with high STR might have a bear totem, while a shaman with high WIL might have an owl totem and one with high CHA might choose an eagle totem. At a minimum, the shaman must possess an attribute of at least 9 in his totem animal’s key attribute. Over time, the shaman will come to resemble his totem animal. A wolf shaman might develop yellow eyes and sharp canines, while a bear shaman might grow husky and hirsute.</p>\n<p>The totem animal has human-like intelligence, with Intellect equal to half the shaman’s Intellect. It can understand the shaman’s speech, and the shaman can understand his totem animal’s speech, though no one else can without resorting to <em>speak with beasts</em>.So long as the shaman upholds his tribal traditions, the totem animal will be utterly loyal to the shaman and will fight for him, perform services, and obey his commands.</p>\n<p>While the totem animal is alive, the shaman receives the animal’s <strong>totem benefit</strong>. The totem benefit is a bonus proficiency related to the totem. For example, a shaman with a cobra totem animal has the Combat Reflexes proficiency so long as he is within 30’ of his totem animal.</p>\n<p>Because it is partly a creature of the shaman’s own spirit, the totem animal always has a number of Hit Dice equal to one less than the shaman’s own (1/2 HD when the shaman is 1st level) with 4 hp per HD. If a totem animal has fewer Hit Dice than those normally possessed by such an animal, it will appear as a smaller, younger creature of its type. If it has more HD, it will appear as a larger, fiercer variant. The animal’s baseline characteristics are adjusted based on its current Hit Dice relative to the Hit Dice of an ordinary animal of its type:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Attack throws are as a monster of its HD; saving throws are as a fighter of half its HD.</li>\n<li>AC increases or decreases by 1 per 2 HD of difference, to a minimum of 0 and maximum of its own ordinary HD. (Round differences of 0.5 to even).</li>\n<li>Average damage for its attack routine (as a whole) increases or decreases by 2 per HD of difference. The Judge should decide how this is manifested, e.g. does it have a bigger bite, sharper claws, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>EXAMPLE: A shaman calls a lion totem animal. An ordinary lion has AC 3, HD 5, and an attack routine consisting of 2 claws (1d4+1) and 1 bite (1d10). Its average damage is (3.5 + 3.5 + 5.5) = 12.5 per attack routine. When the shaman is 1st level, his totem animal appears as a lion cub. It has 1/2 HD, making it 4.5 HD less than an ordinary lion. 4.5 is rounded to 4. AC is decreased by 1 per 2 HD of difference, so the lion cub’s AC is reduced from 3 to 1. Average damage decreases by 2 per HD of difference, so average damage is reduced by 8 points, from 12.5 to 4.5 The Judge decides it attacks with 2 claws (1d3-1) and 1 bite (1d4). When the shaman is 6th level, his totem animal has 5 HD, so it has the characteristics of an ordinary lion. When the shaman is 14th level, his totem animal has 13 HD, making it 8 HD more than an ordinary lion. AC is increased by 4, capped at its ordinary HD of 5. Average damage is increased by 16, to 28.5. the Judge decides it attacks with 2 claws (2d6) and 1 bite (3d8+1).</p>\n<p>If the totem animal is ever killed, the shaman must save versus Death or instantly take damage equal to the totem animal’s maximum total hit points. If a shaman’s totem animal is slain, it can’t be <em>restored<strong>to</strong>life</em>or <em>resurrected</em>.However, a new totem animal of the same type will appear the next time the shaman gains a level of experience. Except where mentioned above, totem animals have the characteristics of a normal animal of their type. These are listed on the Totem Animals table for quick reference; see the <em><strong>ACKS II Monstrous Manual</strong></em>for full details. HD are listed for comparison purposes. The Judge can devise new totem animals if desired.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Totem Animals</strong></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Totem Animal</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Key Attribute</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Totem Benefit</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Characteristics</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Bear</td>\n<td>STR</td>\n<td>Berserkergang</td>\n<td>Spd 120’, AC 3, HD 4, #AT 3, Dmg 1d3/1d3/1d6, hug</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cheetah</td>\n<td>DEX</td>\n<td>Running</td>\n<td>Spd 360’, AC 5, HD 2+2, #AT 3, Dmg 1d2/1d2/1d4, pounce</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Crocodile</td>\n<td>CON</td>\n<td>Combat Ferocity</td>\n<td>Spd 60’/90’ swim, AC 4, HD 2, #AT 1, Dmg 1d8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Crow/Raven</td>\n<td>INT</td>\n<td>Divine Blessing</td>\n<td>Spd 330’ fly, AC 1, HD ¼, #AT 1, Dmg 1d2-1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Dog</td>\n<td>CHA</td>\n<td>Alertness</td>\n<td>Spd 180’, AC 2, HD 1+1, #AT 1, Dmg 1d4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Eagle/Hawk</td>\n<td>CHA</td>\n<td>Command</td>\n<td>Spd 480’ fly, AC 3, HD 1+1, #AT 2, Dmg 1d3/1d3, dive</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Elk</td>\n<td>CON</td>\n<td>Contemplation</td>\n<td>Spd 180’, AC 2, HD 4, #AT 1, Dmg 1d10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Goat</td>\n<td>WIL</td>\n<td>Climbing</td>\n<td>Spd 150’, AC 2, HD 1, Dmg 1d4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Horse</td>\n<td>CON</td>\n<td>Mounted Combat</td>\n<td>Spd 210’, AC 2, HD 2, #AT 2, Dmg 1d4/1d4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Hyena</td>\n<td>CHA</td>\n<td>Weapon Focus</td>\n<td>Spd 150’, AC 2, HD 2+1, #AT 2, Dmg 1d8, bone crush</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Jackal</td>\n<td>INT</td>\n<td>Combat Trickery</td>\n<td>Spd 180’, AC 2, HD 1-1, #AT 1, Dmg 1d4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Lion</td>\n<td>STR</td>\n<td>Divine Health</td>\n<td>Spd 180’, AC 3, HD 5, #AT 3, Dmg 1d4+1/1d4+1/1d10, pounce</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Monkey</td>\n<td>DEX</td>\n<td>Prestidigitation</td>\n<td>Spd 120’, AC 2, HD 1, #AT 1, Dmg 1d3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Rat</td>\n<td>WIL</td>\n<td>Quiet Magic</td>\n<td>Spd 120’/ 60’ swim, AC 2, HD 1/2, #AT 1, Dmg 1d3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Owl</td>\n<td>INT</td>\n<td>Sensing Power</td>\n<td>Spd 300’ fly, AC 3, HD ½, #AT 2, Dmg 1d2/1d2, dive attack</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Python</td>\n<td>STR</td>\n<td>Laying on Hands</td>\n<td>Spd 90’, AC 3, HD 5, #AT 2, Dmg 1d4/2d8, constriction</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Viper</td>\n<td>DEX</td>\n<td>Combat Reflexes</td>\n<td>Spd 90’, AC 3, HD 2, #AT 1, Dmg 1d4, poison</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Wolf</td>\n<td>WIL</td>\n<td>Ambushing</td>\n<td>Spd 180’, AC 2, HD 2+2, #AT 1, Dmg 1d6</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h6>Additional Class Powers</h6>\n<p>When they advance in level, shamans gain the following additional class powers:</p>\n<p><strong>Spiritual Ritual (3rd level):</strong> The shaman can perform a spiritual ritual to re-gain the ability to cast a spell of a level he had previously expended. Each spiritual ritual requires one hour (6 turns). In contrast to the austere contemplation of more civilized crusaders, spiritual rituals involve ecstatic dancing, wild drumming, chanting, and intoxicating smoke. The shaman can perform a spiritual ritual as often as desired, but cannot regain the same level of spell more than once per day.</p>\n<p><strong>Minor Magical Research (5th level):</strong> At 5th level or higher, the shaman can scribe scrolls and brew potions.</p>\n<p><strong>Shapechanging (5th level):</strong> The physical link between the shaman and his totem becomes strong enough for the shaman to <strong>shapechange</strong> into his totem animal. The shaman remains in his new shape until he changes back. A 5th level shaman can initially shapechange once per day. For example, if he begins the day in human form, he can shapechange into his totem animal form, but he then has to remain in totem animal form until the following day, when he can change back to his human shape. With each level of experience gained, the shaman can change shape one additional time per day.</p>\n<p>When in totem animal form, the shaman has the movement, armor class, attacks, damage, and powers listed on the Totem Animals table. He retains his normal Hit Dice, hit points, attack throws, and saving throws. If the shaman is of greater Hit Dice than his animal type, he will appear as a bigger, stronger version of the animal, to a maximum of twice normal size. For example, a 10th level shaman in lion shape would appear as a huge predator, twice the mass of a normal lion. Apart from size, the shaman is indistinguishable from a normal animal. The totem animal shape does not detect as magical, is not detected by spells that reveal illusions, and cannot be <strong>dispelled</strong>. Changing shape can be performed during combat as an action in lieu of an attack.</p>\n<p><strong>Spiritwalking (7th level):</strong> The shaman’s spiritual powers have grown strong enough for him to spiritwalk. After 1 turn (10 minutes) of chanting, the shaman enters a deep trance during which his spirit walks free of his body. A spiritwalking shaman’s spirit can assume either human or totem animal shape as desired. The effects are otherwise identical to the 5th level spell <em>spiritwalk.</em> Spiritwalking is so taxing that it can be performed but once per week.</p>\n<p><strong>Major Magical Research (9th level):</strong> The shaman can create more powerful magic items such as weapons, rings, and staffs.</p>\n<p><strong>Medicine Lodge (9th level):</strong> By acquiring a <strong>medicine lodge</strong> worth at least 15,000gp, the shaman can attract followers to his service. So long as the shaman is currently in favor with his tribe’s powers, he can build his lodge at half the normal price due to divine intervention. 5d6 x 10 0th level tribesmen and 1d6 shamans of 1st level of the same tribe arrive to serve him within 1d3 months of him acquiring the medicine lodge. If the shaman has already acquired a medicine lodge, the followers arrive to serve him within 1d3 months of him reaching 9th level. The followers are fanatically brave and completely loyal (loyalty +4 and morale +4). Despite their loyalty, the followersmust be paid a fair wage or they might eventually leave his service. Additional rules for medicine lodges are detailed in the <strong>Campaign</strong> chapter.</p>\n<p><strong>Supreme Magical Research (11th level):</strong> The shaman can learn and cast ritual divine spells of great power (7th, 8th, and 9th level) and craft magical constructs. XX).</p>\n<h6>Code of Behavior</h6>\n<p>Shamans must uphold the traditions of their ancestors and the gods and spirits they serve. Each shaman’s traditions are determined by the Judge based on the character’s origination and history. If the Judge has not specified particular tribes and traditions for his campaign, the following traditions apply:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The shaman must always display a holy symbol of his tribe and totem somewhere on his person when in public.</li>\n<li>The shaman must make offerings of food and drink to his tribe’s ancestors, gods, and spirits at dusk each day. Offering food and drink requires one hour (6 turns). The offering costs 1cp and weighs 1/6 st.</li>\n<li>The shaman must strive to uphold the noble virtues of his totem. For instance, a bear shaman must strive to be fierce and stalwart, a dog shaman must strive to be alert and loyal, and so on.</li>\n<li>The shaman must not wield strange weapons foreign to his tribe.</li>\n<li>The shaman must not use his divine magic for purposes that would damage or dishonor his tribe, or to deliberately or negligently cause harm to the animals he calls to serve him.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If a shaman ever falls from favor by failing to uphold the tribal traditions, the gods and spirits he serves might impose penalties upon him. As with crusaders, these penalties are entirely up to the Judge.</p>\n<h6>Class Proficiencies</h6>\n<p><strong>Proficiency Progression:</strong> At 1st level, shamans select one class proficiency from their class proficiency list and one general proficiency from the general proficiency list. They select an additional class proficiency at 4th, 8th, and 12th level. They select an additional general proficiency at 5th, 9th, and 13th level.</p>\n<p><strong>Shaman Proficiency List:</strong> Animal Husbandry, Animal Training, Battle Magic, Beast Friendship, Berserkergang, Command, Diplomacy, Divine Blessing, Divine Health, Elementalism, Fighting Style Specialization, Healing, Laying on Hands, Leadership, Loremastery, Magical Engineering, Magical Music, Naturalism, Passing Without Trace, Prestidigitation, Quiet Magic, Sensing Evil, Sensing Power, Syncretism, Theology, Tracking, Unflappable Casting, Weapon Focus</p>\n<h6>Shaman Templates</h6>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>3d6</strong>  <strong>Roll</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Template</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Proficiencies</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Starting Equipment</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3 – 4</td>\n<td>Pariah</td>\n<td>Syncretism  Survival  <strong>Quiet****Magic</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Rat<strong><strong>totem</strong></strong>animal</strong>, heretical holy symbol (horned rat), club, hide armor, itchy wool tunic and pants, rawhide belt, sandals, small sack, waterskin, 2 weeks’ iron rations (enc. 3 4/6 st)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5 – 6</td>\n<td>Wise Man</td>\n<td>Loremastery  Knowledge (history)  <strong>Sensing****Power</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Owl<strong><strong>totem</strong></strong>animal</strong>, holy symbol (silver crescent), quarterstaff, leather armor, grey wool tunic and pants, embossed belt, low boots, backpack, waterskin, 2 weeks’ iron rations, 7gp (enc. 5 3/6 st)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7 – 8</td>\n<td>Warchanter</td>\n<td>Battle Magic  Performance (chanting)  <strong>Berserkergang</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Bear totem animal</strong>,holy symbol (bear’s teeth), iron spear, round wooden shield, leather armor, wool tunic and pants, embossed belt, low boots, backpack, waterskin, 1 week’s iron rations (enc. 5 3/61/2 st)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9 – 10</td>\n<td>Runecaster</td>\n<td>Elementalism  Craft (rune-carving)  <strong>Ambushing</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Wolf totem animal</strong>,holy symbol (runestone), hand axe, wooden shield, leather armor, wool tunic and pants, embossed belt, low boots, backpack, carving knife, flask of holy water, waterskin, 1 week’s iron rations, 1gp (enc. 5 st)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11 – 12</td>\n<td>Druid</td>\n<td>Beast Friendship  Naturalism  <strong>Divine****Blessing</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Raven totem animal</strong><em>,</em> holy symbol (golden sickle), whitewood spear, sickle sword, dagger, shield, leather armor under white druid’s robes, leather belt, low boots, backpack, flask of holy water, 1 lb garlic, 1 lb wolfsbane, waterskin, 1 week’s iron rations, 8gp (enc. 6 2/6 st)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13 – 14</td>\n<td>Snake Handler</td>\n<td>Divine Health  Healing  <strong>Laying<strong><strong>on</strong></strong>Hands</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Python totem animal</strong>, holy symbol (two snakes coiled around rod), long staff, dagger, leather armor under forest green robes, embossed belt, low boots, backpack, 2 lbs birthwort, 2 lbs comfrey, 2 lbs horsetail, 2 lbs woundwort, waterskin, 1 week’s iron rations, 2gp (enc. 6 st)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15 – 16</td>\n<td>Spirit Raiser</td>\n<td>Sensing Evil  Leadership  <strong>Command</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Eagle totem animal</strong>,holy symbol (eagle on sun), quarterstaff, dagger, leather armor under blue robes, leather belt, low boots, backpack, belt pouch, 2 flasks of holy water, tinderbox, 6 tallow candles, 4 lbs garlic, waterskin, 1 week’s iron rations, 25gp (7 st)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17 – 18</td>\n<td>Nomad Shaman</td>\n<td>Unflappable Casting  Riding  <strong>Mounted Combat</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Horse totem animal</strong>,holy symbol (engraved horn),scimitar, round wooden shield, leather armor, wool cloak, wool tunic and pants, leather gloves, leather belt, high boots, backpack, belt pouch, steppe riding horse, riding saddle and tack, 2 leather saddlebags, 2 weeks’ iron rations, 21gp (3 4/6 st with rations on horse)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Notes:</strong> The totem animal and totem proficiency that each shaman template begins with is noted in bold.

A warlock is one who seeks alliance with dark beings and pursues forbidden lore, hoping to find a quicker, easier path to power than the methodical practices of magecraft. Many warlocks become adventurers to plumb the secrets of dusty tombs, forgotten crypts, and hidden sanctums. Few do so for heroic motives.</p>\n<p>These practices leave warlocks reviled and condemned in the Auran Empire. The Tower of Knowledge bars known warlocks from its august halls entirely. Warlocks are treated with respect and more than a little fear in the Sunset Kingdoms of Kemesh, Somirea, and Celdorea, and many assume positions of power in those societies.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Warlock Level Progression</strong></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td><strong>Warlock Spell Progression</strong></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Experience</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Title</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Level</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Hit Dice</strong></td>\n<td></td>\n<td><strong>1</strong></td>\n<td><strong>2</strong></td>\n<td><strong>3</strong></td>\n<td><strong>4</strong></td>\n<td><strong>5</strong></td>\n<td><strong>6</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>Medium</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1d4</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2,500</td>\n<td>Occultist</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2d4</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5,000</td>\n<td>Spiritualist</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3d4</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10,000</td>\n<td>Hexgiver</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4d4</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20,000</td>\n<td>Cursebringer</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>5d4</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>40,000</td>\n<td>Maleficus</td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>6d4</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>80,000</td>\n<td>Infernalist</td>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>7d4</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>160,000</td>\n<td>Warlock</td>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>8d4</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>310,000</td>\n<td>Dread Lord</td>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>9d4</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>460,000</td>\n<td>Dread Lord, 10th level</td>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>9d4 + 1*</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>610,000</td>\n<td>Dread Lord, 11th level</td>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>9d4 + 2*</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>760,000</td>\n<td>Dread Lord, 12th level</td>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>9d4 + 3*</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>910,000</td>\n<td>Dread Lord, 13th level</td>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>9d4 + 4*</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1,060,000</td>\n<td>Dread King</td>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>9d4 + 5*</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>*No adjustment from Constitution applies to this flat bonus.</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h6>Combat Characteristics</h6>\n<p>Because of their devotion to arcane study, warlocks receive limited combat training.

The number and levels of spells the warlock can cast in a single day are listed on the Warlock Spell Progression table. A warlock’s spell selection is limited to the spells in his <strong>repertoire</strong>. A warlock’s repertoire can include the number of spells up to the number and level of spells listed for his level, increased by his Intellect bonus. More information on casting spells and individual spell descriptions can be found in the <strong>Spells</strong> chapter.</p>\n<p><strong>Dark Path:</strong> Every warlock has chosen to follow a dark path. There are three darks path available: <strong>demonology</strong>, <strong>necromancy</strong>, and <strong>transmogrification</strong>. Each dark path rewards the warlock with one class power at 1st level and one additional class power at 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, and 11th level. The rewards granted are determined by the warlock’s choice of path. When the warlock is created, select the character’s dark path from options listed below or talk with your Judge about the patrons available in his campaign setting.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Tradition</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Region</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Description</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Demonology</td>\n<td>Auran Empire, Jutland</td>\n<td>Diabolists who call on the demonic power of the Outer Darkness.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Necromancy</td>\n<td>Kemesh</td>\n<td>Morbid practitioners of the forbidden craft of necromancy.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Transmogrification</td>\n<td>Rorn, Southern Argollë</td>\n<td>Sculptors of flesh who create living horrors.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Occultism:</strong> Every warlock has studied the forbidden secrets of the occult. On a proficiency throw of 11+, he can name the popular titles and symbols of chthonic powers; identify the type of undead creature encountered; and otherwise recall information of interest to demonology and necromancy. (This class power counts as one rank of Knowledge (Occult) proficiency).</p>\n<h6>Additional Class Powers</h6>\n<p>When they advance in level, warlocks gain the following additional class powers:</p>\n<p><strong>Dark Path II (3rd level):</strong> The warlock’s dark path grants him his second reward.</p>\n<p><strong>Dark Path III (5th level):</strong> The warlock’s dark path grants him his third reward.</p>\n<p><strong>Minor Magical Research (5th level):</strong> The warlock can research spells, scribe magical scrolls, and brew potions.</p>\n<p><strong>Dark Path IV (7th level):</strong> The warlock’s dark path grants him his fourth reward.</p>\n<p><strong>Dark Path V (9th level:</strong> The warlock’s dark path grants him his fifth reward.</p>\n<p><strong>Major Magical Research (9th level):</strong> The warlock can create more powerful magic items such as weapons, rings, and staffs.</p>\n<p><strong>Sanctum (9th level):</strong> By acquiring a <strong>sanctum</strong> (often a great tower) worth at least 15,000gp, the warlock can attract followers to his service. 1d6 apprentices of 1st – 3rd level plus 2d6 apprentices of 0th level arrive to serve him as followers within 1d3 months of him acquiring the sanctum. If the warlock already has a sanctum, the followers arrive to serve him within 1d3 months of him reaching 9th level. The apprentices function as assistants in magical research (see p. XXX). If performing magic research, the apprentices must be provided food and lodging, but need not be paid wages. (If asked to accompany the mage on adventure, the apprentices must be paid wages as henchmen.) If the warlock builds a <strong>dungeon</strong> beneath or near his sanctum, monsters will start to arrive to dwell within, often followed by adventurers seeking to fight them. Additional rules for <strong>sanctums</strong> are detailed in the <strong>Campaigns</strong> chapter (p. XX).</p>\n<p><strong>Dark Path VI (11th level):</strong> The warlock’s dark path grants him his sixth reward.</p>\n<p><strong>Supreme Magical Research (11th level):</strong> The warlock can learn and cast ritual arcane spells of great power (7th, 8th, and 9th level), craft magical constructs, and create magical cross-breeds. If chaotic, the warlock can create necromantic servants and become undead.</p>\n<h6>Dark Paths</h6>\n<p>Demonology</p>\n<p><strong>Conjure Dark Powers (1st level):</strong> When the demonologist casts summoning spells (such as<em>conjure fiend</em>or <em>summon**shadows</em>), the spell effects are calculated as if he were two caster levels higher than his actual level of experience. (This makes them harder to dispel.) If the character loses his concentration due to taking damage while controlling a conjured creature, he must make a Spells saving throw. If the save succeeds, he maintains his concentration. His eligibility to conduct research on summoning magic is determined as if he were two caster levels higher than actual. He gains a +2 bonus on magic research throws and increases his research rate by 10% when researching summoning magic. Conjure Dark Powers can stack with the Mastery of Conjuration and Summoning proficiency, such that the character’s summoning spells and research are calculated as if he were three (rather than two) caster levels higher and he gains a +2 bonus on his Spells saving throw to maintain concentration.</p>\n<p><strong>Theology (3rd level):</strong> The demonologist has become a cultist of the chthonic powers. He gains one rank of the Theology proficiency.</p>\n<p><strong>Conjure Hellion (5th level):</strong> The demonologist has made pacts with demon lords. He can cast <em>conjure hellion</em>once per day.</p>\n<p>**Expanded Repertoire (7th level):**The demonologist gains an expanded repertoire, increasing the number of slots in his repertoire of each level that he can cast by one. He must learn the specific spells separately. The additional spells must be conjuration or summoning spells, learned either from studying existing spells or by magic research of new spells.</p>\n<p><strong>Words of Command and Obedience (9th):</strong> The demonologistcan compel his conjured and summoned creatures to obey his inexorable will. Any creatures summoned by the demonologist will obey him to the best of their ability rather than seek to pervert his intention. Any creatures he conjures will depart without harming him if his concentration is broken.</p>\n<p><strong>Power of Sacrifice (11th level):</strong> Bargaining with the infernal powers has taught the demonologist the power of sacrifice. He can gain arcane power by blood sacrifice, and counts any arcane power from blood sacrifice as double its gp value. He can store the arcane power from blood sacrifices indefinitely, even when not actively performing magical research. See the rules for Arcane Power (p. XX) and Blood Sacrifice (p. XX).</p>\n<p>Necromancy</p>\n<p><strong>Secrets of the Dark Arts (1st):</strong> The necromancer can control undead as a Chaotic crusader of one half his class level. If the character casts death spells, his targets suffer a -2 penalty on their saving throws. When the character casts necromantic spells (such as <em>animate undead</em>), the spell effects are calculated as if he were two class levels higher than his actual level of experience. His eligibility to research death or necromancy magic is determined as if he were two caster levels higher than actual. He gains a +2 bonus on magic research throws and increases his research rate by 10% when researching death or necromancy magic. Secrets of the Dark Arts can stack with the Black Lore of Zahar proficiency, such that the character can control undead as a crusader of two-thirds his class level (rounded up), and his death and necromancy spells and research are calculated as if he were three (rather than two) caster levels higher than his actual caster level.</p>\n<p><strong>Mortuary Science (3rd):</strong> The necromancer has undertaken a deep study of anatomy, circulation, disease, and vitality. He gains one rank of the Healing proficiency.</p>\n<p><strong>Speak with Dead (5th)</strong><em>:</em> The dead hold no secrets for the necromancer. He can cast <em>speak with the dead</em>once per day.</p>\n<p>**Expanded Repertoire (7th level):**The necromancer gains an expanded repertoire, increasing the number of slots in his repertoire of each level that he can cast by one. He must learn the specific spells separately. The additional spells must be death and necromancy spells, learned either from studying existing spells or by magic research of new spells.</p>\n<p><strong>Lordship Over the Undead (9th)</strong><em>:</em> In black tomes and evil liturgies, the necromancer has gained lordship over the undead. Whenever the character succeeds in controlling undead (whether from a roll or automatically from a “R” result), the undead are controlled for 1 day per level instead of the usual 1 turn per level. If the undead would have been controlled for 1 day per level (from a “D” result), the undead are instead controlled indefinitely.</p>\n<p><strong>Secrets of Life and Death (11th):</strong> The necromancer has finally unlocked the secrets of life and death. He can perform necromancy at half the usual material cost and research cost.</p>\n<p>Transmogrification</p>\n<p><strong>Grotesque Arts of Transformation (1st):</strong> When the character casts transmogrification spells, the spell effects are calculated as if he were two class levels higher than his actual level of experience. His eligibility to create crossbreeds or research transmogrification magic is determined as if he were two caster levels higher than actual. Targets of his transmogrification spells suffer a -2 penalty to their saving throw. He gains a +2 bonus on magic research throws and increases his research rate by 10% when creating crossbreeds or researching transmogrification magic. Grotesque Arts can stack with the Transmogrification proficiency, such that the character’s transmogrification spells are calculated as if he were three (rather than two) caster levels higher and his bonus to magic research and research rate is increased to +3 and 15%.</p>\n<p><strong>Alchemy (3rd level)</strong>:To master the art of transmogrification one must unravel the secrets of alchemy. The character gains one rank of the Alchemy proficiency.</p>\n<p><strong>Skinchange (5th level)</strong>: The transmogrifier has learned to transcend his own form. He can cast <em>skinchange</em>once per day.</p>\n<p>**Expanded Repertoire (7th level):**The transmogrifier gains an expanded repertoire, increasing the number of slots in his repertoire of each level that he can cast by one. He must learn the specific spells separately. The additional spells must be transmogrification spells, learned either from studying existing spells or by magic research of new spells.</p>\n<p><strong>Hideous Servant (9th level):</strong> Experiments combining living creatures with the transmogrifier’s own flesh and blood have created a hideous servantintimately bonded to his will. The hideous servant is mechanically similar to a shaman’s totem animal (see p. XX).However, the sorcerer selects two of his hideous servant’s characteristics (AC, movement, attack routine, and special abilities) from one animal and two characteristics from another, while the servant’s base Hit Dice are set to the average of the two animals selected. (Remember that actual HD will be adjusted by the character’s level.) He does not gain a totem benefit.</p>\n<p><strong>Shape Flesh and Bone (11th level):</strong> The transmogrifier can mold flesh and bone like clay. The character is able to create magical crossbreeds at half the usual material cost and research cost.</p>\n<h6>Corrupting Weaknesses</h6>\n<p>Though it grants them great power, the dark path tread by the warlock carries a terrible cost. At 1st level, and again at 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, and 11th level, the warlock is afflicted by a <strong>corrupting weakness.</strong> The Judge can pick from the list below or ask the player to roll 1d10:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Disfigured:</strong> Sorcerous studies have begun to make the warlock a monstrous figure, leaving him misshapen limbs, clawed hands or feet, hideous scarring, strangely colored eyes, and so on. Each disfigurement imposes a -2 penalty to reaction rolls with sapient creatures of Lawful or Neutral alignment.</li>\n<li><strong>Distrusted</strong>: Lore best left unstudied has twisted the warlock’s demeanor and personality. A reaction roll with sapient creatures of Lawful or Neutral alignment can never achieve a friendly (12+) result. Each time this weakness is selected thereafter, reduce the best possible reaction roll by one further step.</li>\n<li><strong>Enervated</strong>: The warlock’s exploration of sinister sorcery has sapped his soul of strength and vigor. His Constitution is reduced by 2 points each time this weakness occurs.</li>\n<li><strong>Frightening to Beasts:</strong> The warlock’s corruption is unsettling to animals. They growl, hiss, rear up, and otherwise make their displeasure known whenever he is within 10’. The warlock suffers a -4 reaction roll when encountering animals or giant animals. He cannot ride normal mounts. Characters with Beast Friendship proficiency (or related class powers) can detect something is unnatural about the warlock, but do not suffer a reaction roll penalty. If the warlock himself had Beast Friendship proficiency, the proficiency’s effects now only help when dealing with wild predators and scavengers, such as wolves and vultures (in which cases the above penalty will not apply).</li>\n<li><strong>Haunted:</strong> Whispers from the beyond plague the warlock. They are difficult to ignore, and impose a -2 penalty to listening throws and -1 penalty to initiative and surprise rolls. The penalty is cumulative each time this weakness occurs.</li>\n<li><strong>Mad:</strong> So disturbing are the warlock’s dark secrets that he has begun to lose his grip on reality. Each day he must make a Spells saving throw or go <strong>mad</strong> for 1 – 10 hours. The warlock’s first saving throw against madness is at +20, but each consecutive saving throw is one point less advantaged. When the warlock goes mad, he falls under the Judge’s control for 1d10 hours, during which time his behavior is entirely unpredictable. The day after a bout of madness, the warlock resumes his saving throws with a +20 bonus.</li>\n<li><strong>Mutated:</strong> The corrupting influences of dark magic have begun to warp the warlock’s body. The first time this weakness occurs, roll 1d10 on the Magical Mutations sub-table (p. XX). The second time it occurs, roll 1d10+1. The third time it occurs, roll 1d10+2, and so on.</li>\n<li><strong>Nocturnal:</strong> Creatures of darkness and evil hunt by night, and sleep by day. So too does the warlock. He cannot regain spells unless he sleeps during the day. Due to his nocturnal habits, he suffers a penalty of -2 to all throws when in sunlight. This penalty is increased by an additional 2 points each time this weakness occurs.</li>\n<li><strong>Obsessed:</strong> The warlock’s self-control and will begin to erode in the face of ongoing corruption. His Will is reduced by 2 points each time this weakness occurs.</li>\n<li><strong>Sleepless:</strong> Haunted by nightmares and disturbing visions of the grave, the warlock finds it hard to sleep. Each time he attempts to rest, he must roll 1d6. On a 1, the warlock tosses and turns all night, regaining no hit points and recovering no spells. The chance of sleeplessness increases by 1 each time this weakness occurs, to a maximum of five times.</li>\n</ol>\n<h6>Class Proficiencies</h6>\n<p><strong>Proficiency Progression:</strong> At 1st level, warlocks select one class proficiency from their class proficiency list and one general proficiency from the general proficiency list. They select an additional class proficiency at 6th and 12th level. They select an additional general proficiency at 5th, 9th, and 13th level.</p>\n<p><strong>Warlock Proficiency List</strong>: Alchemy, Battle Magic, Beast Friendship, Black Lore of Zahar, Counterspelling, Divine Blessing, Elementalism, Elven Bloodline, Expanded Repertoire, Experimenting, Familiar, Illusion Resistance, Knowledge, Language, Loremastery, Magical Engineering, Mastery of Enchantments &amp; Illusions, Mastery of Conjuration &amp; Summoning, Mystic Aura, Naturalism, Poisoning, Prestidigitation, Quiet Magic, Sensing Good, Sensing Power, Soothsaying, Transmogrification, Unflappable Casting</p>\n<h6>Warlock Templates</h6>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>3d6 Roll</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Template</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Proficiencies</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Starting Equipment</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3-4</td>\n<td>Chthonicist  (Necromancer)</td>\n<td>Quiet Magic  Caving  Mapping</td>\n<td>Musty old spellbook with <em>choking grip</em> and <em>frighten humanoid</em>,gnarled oaken staff, tattered robe, low boots, backpack, quill and ink, tinderbox, 24 torches, waterskin, 1 weeks’ iron rations, 1gp (7 1/6 st)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5-6</td>\n<td>Furtive Cultist  (Demonologist)</td>\n<td>Mastery of Conj. &amp; Sum.

The bonus proficiency and bonus spell that each template begins with are noted last. For characters with INT of less than 13 or greater than 15, see the <strong>Intellect Scores of Arcane Spellcasters</strong> section earlier in this Chapter.</p>\n<h3>Witch</h3>\n<p>Key Attribute: INT and WIL</p>\n<p>Requirements: None</p>\n<p>Hit Dice: 1d4</p>\n<p>Maximum Level: 14</p>\n<p>The ignorant will often refer to any female spellcaster as a witch. Actual witches, however, are women who practice a distinct craft of magic. Like priestesses and shamans, witches invoke divine magic, but they do not organize into communities of faith nor do they dedicate themselves to the service of their gods or goddesses. Rather, they seek to gain personal knowledge and strength by bartering with the old powers of the world. Through ancient pacts, forgotten prayers, secret names of power, and other means, they appease, bargain, coerce, convince, and harness divine power to their own ends. Their quest for knowledge and power often drives witches to become adventurers.</p>\n<p>Within the Auran Empire, witches are viewed with deep suspicion by the Empyrean priests, but many rural villages nevertheless have a wise woman with some skill in witchcraft. Witches are fairly common in Southern Argollë, Jutland, Rorn, Kemesh, and the Ivory Kingdoms, each of which has flourishing traditions of witchcraft.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Witch Level Progression</strong></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td><strong>Witch Spell Progression</strong></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Experience</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Title</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Level</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Hit Dice</strong></td>\n<td></td>\n<td><strong>1</strong></td>\n<td><strong>2</strong></td>\n<td><strong>3</strong></td>\n<td><strong>4</strong></td>\n<td><strong>5</strong></td>\n<td><strong>6</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>Initiate</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1d4</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2,000</td>\n<td>Seeress</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2d4</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4,000</td>\n<td>Siren</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3d4</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8,000</td>\n<td>Pythoness</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4d4</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16,000</td>\n<td>Sibyl</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>5d4</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>32,000</td>\n<td>Enchantress</td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>6d4</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>65,000</td>\n<td>Sorceress</td>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>7d4</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>130,000</td>\n<td>Incantrix</td>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>8d4</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>230,000</td>\n<td>Witch</td>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>9d4</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>330,000</td>\n<td>Witch, 10th level</td>\n<td>10*</td>\n<td>9d4 + 1</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>430,000</td>\n<td>Witch, 11th level</td>\n<td>11*</td>\n<td>9d4 + 2</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>530,000</td>\n<td>Witch, 12th level</td>\n<td>12*</td>\n<td>9d4 + 3</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>630,000</td>\n<td>Witch, 13th level</td>\n<td>13*</td>\n<td>9d4 + 4</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>730,000</td>\n<td>Witch Queen</td>\n<td>14*</td>\n<td>9d4 + 5</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>*No adjustment from Constitution applies to this flat bonus.</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h6>Combat Characteristics</h6>\n<p>Witches are devoted to their craft and receive little combat training.</p>\n<p><strong>Combat Proficiencies:</strong> Witches have weapon proficiency with clubs, daggers, darts, and staffs.

Unlike most other divine casters, who receive their spells from prayer, witches receive their spells from study. Witches follow the same spell progression and use the same rules for learning and casting spells as mages. They record their repertoires of spells in spell books and can learn new spells from scribing scrolls or studying other divine spell books. They select their spells from the divine spell list, rather than the arcane spell list, however, and cannot learn or cast spells found in arcane spell books. See p. XX for more details on studious divine spellcasting.</p>\n<p><strong>Tradition:</strong> Every witch belongs to a <strong>tradition</strong>, which defines her approach to the magic and her relationship with the gods and spirits that are her source of power. The regions within the Auran Empire campaign setting associated with each tradition are noted below. Judges can create other traditions for their own campaign settings where necessary.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Tradition</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Region</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Description</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Antiquarian</td>\n<td>Auran Empire, Jutland, Ivory Kingdom</td>\n<td>Wise women who focus on healing and beneficial potions, they practice their traditional craft wherever rural human settlements may be found.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Chthonic</td>\n<td>Kemesh, Ivory Kingdom</td>\n<td>Malefic practitioners who consort with the darkest of powers, reveling in the seduction and corruption of the innocent.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Sylvan</td>\n<td>Rorn, Southern Argollë</td>\n<td>Reclusive witches who travel the borderlands between human settlements and fey forests.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>She can acquire congregants through proselytizing. She can automatically identify religious symbols, spell signatures, trappings, and holy days of her own tradition, and can recognize those of other faiths with a proficiency throw of 11+. Rare or occult cults might be harder to recognize. (This class power counts as one rank of Theology proficiency). In addition, each tradition grants a special ability at 1st, 3rd, 5th, and 7th level.</p>\n<p><strong>Village Wisdom (1st level):</strong> All witches can perform minor acts of “hedge magic” useful in village life, such as alleviating cold symptoms, easing the pains of childbirth, driving away bedbugs from a mattress, removing mites and ticks from a creature, and so on. Each use takes 1 turn (10 minutes). (If your Judge is using the optional rules for cantrips from <em>Axioms,</em> this class power grants the witch the ability to learn and cast divine cantrips instead.)</p>\n<h6>Additional Class Powers</h6>\n<p>When they advance in level, witches gain the following additional class powers:</p>\n<p><strong>Brew Potions (3rd level):</strong> The witch can brew potions. However, she cannot yet research new spells or scribe scrolls.</p>\n<p><strong>Minor Magical Research (5th level):</strong> The witch can research new spells. However, she cannot yet scribe scrolls.</p>\n<p><strong>Scribe Scrolls (7th level):</strong> The witch can create magic scrolls.</p>\n<p><strong>Witch’s Cottage (9th level:</strong> By acquiring a cottage worth at least 15,000gp, the witch can attract followers to her service. 1d6 apprentices of 1st – 3rd level plus 2d6 apprentices of 0th level arrive to serve her as followers within 1d3 months of her acquiring the cottage. If the witch already has a cottage, the followers arrive to serve her within 1d3 months of her reaching 9th level. The apprentices function as assistants in magical research (see p. XXX). If performing magic research, the apprentices must be provided food and lodging, but need not be paid wages. (If asked to accompany the witch on adventure, the apprentices must be paid wages as henchmen.) A normal woman in training typically takes 2 years to become a 1st level witch. Additional rules for witch’s cottages are detailed in the <strong>Campaigns</strong> chapter.</p>\n<p><strong>Major Magical Research (9th level):</strong> The witch can create more powerful magic items such as weapons, rings, and staffs.</p>\n<p><strong>Supreme Magical Research (11th level):</strong> The witch can learn and cast ritual divine spells of great power (7th, 8th, and 9th level) and craft magical constructs. If chaotic, the witch can create necromantic servants and become undead. Rules for magic research can be found in the <strong>Campaigns</strong> chapter (p. XX).</p>\n<h6>Traditions</h6>\n<p>Antiquarian Witch</p>\n<p><strong>Traditional Medicine (1st level):</strong> The antiquarian witch practices an ancient tradition of natural medicine using healing herbs. She can identify and forage for healing herbs as if she had one rank of Naturalism proficiency. (If she already has Naturalism, she gains a +4 bonus on proficiency throws to identify and forage for healing herbs.) She can use healing herbs as if she had Healing proficiency. Given one turn (10 minutes), she can combine a pound of healing herbs with an equal gp of special components to create potent healing herbs that increase their effect by +1. The witch needs a cauldron over a fire or a kitchen to make potent healing herbs. The potent herbs lose all efficacy after 24 hours.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: Bronwyn is an antiquarian witch. She has one pound of comfrey (10gp value), one pound of woundwort (10gp), and two marsh ghoul livers (10gp each). When her party camps for the night, she uses her Natural Medicine power. First, she mixes comfrey with ghoul liver to create potent comfrey that heals 1d3+1 damage. Then she mixes woundwort with ghoul liver to create potent woundwort that grants a +3 bonus to Healing throws. However, the herbs will lose their efficacy if not used within the next day.</p>\n<p><strong>Healing Arts (3rd level):</strong> The antiquarian witch’s knowledge of the healing arts deepens. She gains one rank of Healing proficiency. (If she already has three ranks of Healing proficiency, she can gain a rank of Alchemy or Naturalism instead.)</p>\n<p><strong>Second Sight (5th level):</strong> Because of the antiquarian witch’s connection with the hidden world, she can see innately or magically invisible creatures within 60’. Invisible creatures are aware that the witch can see them, and might take a particular interest in her as a result. Second Sight does not provide the ability to see creatures or features hidden through cover or darkness.</p>\n<p><strong>Magic Mirror (7th level):</strong> By directing her gaze onto a mirror, crystal, reflective pool, or other surface upon which the images can be displayed, the antiquarian witch can see visions of faraway people and places. She can cast <em>scry</em> (as the spell) once per day. Each use takes 1 turn (10 minutes). If the witch has <em>clairaudiency</em>or <em>telepathy</em>in her repertoire, she can cast either spell at the same time in order to use one of those spells while scrying.</p>\n<p>Chthonic Witch</p>\n<p><strong>Bedazzling Glamour (1st level)</strong>: Vain and narcissistic, the chthonic witch has learned how to use magical glamour to conceal her imperfections. While active, the glamour grants her three benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The witch gains a +1 bonus to all reaction rolls. This bonus does not stack with Mystic Aura (though the other effects do).</li>\n<li>The witch does not suffer any age-related penalty to CHA.</li>\n<li>Permanent wounds or side effects that otherwise would cause a penalty to her reaction rolls are ignored.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Activating her glamour demands one turn (10 minutes) of concentration by the witch. Once activated, the glamour remains active until she ends it, is subject to a <strong>dispel</strong> effect, or is incapacitated. While the glamour is active, the witch radiates magic.</p>\n<p><strong>Decadent Arts (3rd level):</strong> The chthonic witch is a practiced seductress. She gains the Seduction proficiency. (If she already has Seduction, she can select Diplomacy or Intimidation instead.)</p>\n<p><strong>Subtle Beguilement (5th level):</strong> With subtle words of praise and disdain, the chthonic witch can beguile the weak-willed. When casting enchantment spells, the witch counts as having the Quiet Magic proficiency. If she already has Quiet Magic proficiency, she can cast enchantment spells using subvocalized words and no hand gestures. In either case, targets of her enchantment spells suffer a -2 penalty to their saving throw, or a -3 penalty if she also has Mastery of Enchantment &amp; Illusions proficiency.</p>\n<p><strong>Evil Eye (7th level):</strong> The chthonic witch can hex a foe with the merest glance. She can <em>bestow curse</em> as a spell-like ability once per week. Because her Evil Eye is a spell-like ability and not a spell, she does not need to declare she is casting it before initiative, nor does taking damage or failing a saving throw prior to her initiative segment prevent her from using it.</p>\n<p>Sylvan Witch</p>\n<p><strong>Friend of Birds and Beasts (1st level):</strong> From long years in the company of wild and fey things, the sylvan witch has gained the friendship of birds and beasts. She can identify plants and fauna with a proficiency throw of 11+. She can understand the vocalizations and body language of birds and beasts, enabling her to understand any simple messages the animals might be communicating (such as “danger is nearby, be alert,” “you’re unfamiliar and strange,” or “do not come closer, we are guarding our den!”). Because of her innate understanding of the language of beasts, the witch also counts as proficient for purposes of handling trained animals in their roles such as droving or shepherding. She gains +2 to all reaction rolls when encountering normal animals and can take animals as henchmen. She can train and handle animal henchmen to perform tricks or serve a particular role without having to separately possess Animal Training. If the witch also has the Beast Friendship proficiency, she can identify plants and fauna with a throw of 7+ and can take one more henchman than her Charisma would otherwise permit, as long as at least one is an animal. (The bonus to reaction rolls does not increase.)</p>\n<p><strong>Natural Arts (3rd level)</strong>: The sylvan witch knows the secrets of the woodlands. She gains the Naturalism proficiency. (If she already has Naturalism, she can take a second rank or select Alchemy or Healing instead.)</p>\n<p><strong>Close Friend of Birds and Beasts (5th level):</strong> The sylvan witch’s friendship with birds and beasts improves. She can <em>speak with beasts</em> (as the spell) at will. If she ever rolls Friendly reactions while speaking with small, cute animals such as songbirds, squirrels, and rabbits, the animals act as if <em>bewitched</em> in her presence.</p>\n<p><strong>Enchanted Forest (7th level)</strong>: The woodland home of a sylvan witch becomes a strange and magical place. She gains the power to cast <em>forest enchantment</em>(as the spell) once per week. Each use takes 1 turn (10 minutes). The sylvan witch can sustain a number of <em>forest enchantments</em> equal to her caster level, enabling her to enchant a vast swathe of territory (approximately 2 acres per level).</p>\n<h6>Code of Behavior</h6>\n<p>When a young woman first undertakes the study of witchcraft, she often believes she has discovered a path to freedom and power denied to others of her age and sex. And this is true – at first. A young witch only needs to interact with weak and enfeebled spiritual entities in order to cast her spells, and these beings she can dominate through sheer charisma and will. But as she begins to learn and cast more powerful spells, the witch must interact with increasingly powerful and ancient powers. These beings cannot be cajoled or coerced; they must be bargained with. Over time, the witch accumulates an increasing number of <strong>obligations</strong> to these beings, obligations that restrict her behavior as much as any priestess’s strictures.</p>\n<p>A witch starts with one simple obligationat 1st level and gains an additional obligation each time she gains the ability to cast another level of spells. The obligations become increasingly severe at higher levels, with the exact nature of the obligations determined by the Judge based on the witch’s alignment, tradition, and spell repertoire. The following obligations would be suitable for an antiquarian witch of Lawful or Neutral alignment:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>1st level: The witch must light a candle and pray over it for one turn (10 minutes) at noon and midnight.</li>\n<li>3rd level: The witch cannot lie. She can equivocate, prevaricate, speak in riddles, or stay silent, however.</li>\n<li>5th level: If the witch unjustly wrongs another human or demi-human, she must redress the wrong at threefold its value.</li>\n<li>7th level: If the witch accepts a gift, she must offer a gift of threefold value to the gift giver.</li>\n<li>9th level: If the witch suffers a personal wrong, she must exact retribution of threefold value from the one who wronged her.</li>\n<li>11th level: The witch’s soul is sworn to service after death. She cannot be restored to life by any means short of a <em>wish</em> or <em>miracle</em>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If a witch fails to uphold her obligations, the powers she is obligated to will certainly extract punishment. These penalties are entirely up to the Judge and might include curses, reductions in spells available, or even loss of some or all class powers entirely. To remove the penalties, the witch will have to atone for her violation by, e.g., sacrificing treasure, undertaking quests, or even receiving an <strong>atonement</strong> spell from a powerful caster of her order (Judge’s discretion).</p>\n<h6>Class Proficiencies</h6>\n<p><strong>Proficiency Progression:</strong> At 1st level, witches select one class proficiency from their class proficiency list and one general proficiency from the general proficiency list. They select an additional class proficiency at 4th, 8th, and 12th level. They select an additional general proficiency at 5th, 9th, and 13th level.</p>\n<p><strong>Witch Proficiency List:</strong> Alchemy, Arcane Dabbling, Beast Friendship, Black Lore of Zahar, Contemplation, Divine Blessing, Divine Health, Elementalism, Elven Bloodline, Expanded Repertoire, Familiar, Illusion Resistance, Laying on Hands, Loremastery, Magical Engineering, Magical Music, Mastery of Enchantments &amp; Illusions, Mystic Aura, Naturalism, Passing without Trace, Poisoning, Prestidigitation, Prophecy, Quiet Magic, Sensing Power, Soothsaying, Transmogrification, Unflappable Casting</p>\n<h6>Witch Templates</h6>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>3d6 Roll</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Template</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Proficiencies</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Starting Equipment</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3-4</td>\n<td>Crone  (Antiquarian)</td>\n<td>Familiar  Intimidation</td>\n<td><em>Black cat familiar</em>, tattered prayer book with <em>sling stone</em> and <em>frighten beast</em>, gnarled oak staff, tattered cloak, patched wool dress, frayed leather belt, scuffed high boots, backpack, tinderbox, 5 musty tallow candles, 6 torches, waterskin, 1 week’s iron rations, 11gp (4 5/6 st)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5-6</td>\n<td>Witch of the Woods  (Sylvan)</td>\n<td>Passing without Trace  Survival</td>\n<td>Leather-bound prayer book with <em>call of the wolf</em> and <em>locate animal or plant,</em> holy symbol (oak tree), slender whitewood staff, bark-colored wool cloak, leaf-green wool dress, leather belt, high boots, backpack, tinderbox, 6 torches, waterskin, 1 week’s iron rations, 7gp (4 1/6 st)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7-8</td>\n<td>Dark Oracle  (Chthonic)</td>\n<td>Prophecy  Knowledge (astrology)</td>\n<td>Bloodstained prayer book with <em>bane-rune</em> and <em>tenebrosity,</em> unholy symbol (purple circle on black), polished blackwood staff, purple and black linen chiton, embossed belt, high strappy sandals, backpack, tinderbox, 5 black tallow candles, 1 purple wax candle, 12 torches, flask of unholy water, waterskin, 1 week’s iron rations, 1gp (6 3/6 st)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9-10</td>\n<td>Village Witch  (Antiquarian)</td>\n<td>Laying on Hands  Healing</td>\n<td>Handed-down prayer book with <em>cure light injury</em> and <em>purify food and water,</em> holy symbol (pair of horns around lunar disc), slender oak staff, wool freeholder’s dress, embossed belt, high boots, backpack, 1 lb birthwort, 1 lb comfrey, 1 lb goldenrod, 1 lb woundwort, tinderbox, 3 scented wax candles, 12 torches, waterskin, 1 week’s iron rations, 5gp (6 2/6 st)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11-12</td>\n<td>Lorelei  (Sylvan)</td>\n<td>Magical Music  Performance (singing)</td>\n<td>Bark-bound prayer book with <em>remove fear</em> and <em>angelic choir,</em> holy symbol (white bird), slender whitewood staff, elaborate bronze choker necklace (20gp value), elegant leaf-green dress, autumn-hued silk sash, low boots, backpack, tinderbox, 2 tallow candles, flask of holy water, waterskin, 1 week’s iron rations, 6gp (3 4/6 st)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13-14</td>\n<td>Death Mistress  (Chthonic)</td>\n<td>Black Lore of Zahar  Knowledge (occult)</td>\n<td>Flesh-bound prayer book with <em>unliving puppet</em> and <em>allure,</em> unholy symbol (medusa’s head), stiletto, black leather cloak and long gloves, black silk veil and sash, black linen chiton, high leather boots, silver bangles (20gp value), silver earrings (20gp), backpack, tinderbox, 6 black tallow candles, waterskin, 1 week’s iron rations, 28gp (3 2/6 st)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15-16</td>\n<td>Wise Woman  (Antiquarian)</td>\n<td>Loremastery  Knowledge (history)</td>\n<td>Ancient prayer book with <em>counterspell</em> and <em>predict weather,</em> holy symbol (pair of horns around lunar disc), gnarled oak staff, sturdy wool cloak, well-made wool dress, low boots, backpack, belt pouch, tinderbox, lantern, 3 flasks of common oil, 1 lb birthwort, 1 lb comfrey, 1 lb goldenrod, 1 lb woundwart, flask of holy water, waterskin, 1 week’s iron rations, 22gp (4 5/6 st)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17-18</td>\n<td>Faerie Princess  (Sylvan)</td>\n<td>Elven Bloodline  Riding</td>\n<td>Flowery prayer book with <em>word of command</em> and <em>holy circle,</em> holy symbol (flower garland), slender whitewood staff, gossamer head dress (15gp value), elegant white linen dress, colorful silk sash, high boots, tinderbox, 6 wood-scented tallow candles, light riding horse, riding tack and saddle, saddlebag, waterskin, 1 week’s iron rations, 3gp (enc. 3 st with rations on horse)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Notes:</strong> The death mistress’s stiletto is a type of dagger.

While assassins can wear medium armor, they cannot use their backstabbing, hiding, or sneaking powers unless wearing light armor or less.</p>\n<p><strong>Backstabbing</strong>: Assassins are skilled at treacherously attacking unprepared enemies. An assassin can backstab any <strong>vulnerable</strong> opponent. Backstabs can be made in melee or with missile weapons at short range, but cannot be made with missile weapons at medium or longer range. When backstabbing, an assassin gains a +4 bonus to hit and if the attack succeeds, the assassin deals an additional die of damage at 1st level, and another additional die at 5th, 9th, and 13th level.</p>\n<p><strong>Hiding:</strong> Assassins are trained to skulk unseen in the cover of darkness. An assassin can begin hiding as a combat action anytime he is in cover, dim light, or darkness. When the assassin begins hiding, the Judge must make a Hiding proficiency throw on behalf of the assassin. An assassin will always think he is successful in this skill, and will not know otherwise until others react to his presence. Regardless of whether the throw succeeds, opponents encountering the assassin suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls as long as he remains stationary in cover, dim light, or darkness.</p>\n<p>If the throw succeeds, the assassin is <strong>hidden</strong>. If the throw fails, the assassin is not hidden. No creature can claim line of sight on an assassin that is hidden from it. If a hidden assassin engages an unengaged opponent, the opponent cannot make a free facing change (p. XX). If an opponent knows the hidden assassin’s general location, the opponent can attack him in melee at a -4 penalty, but it cannot even blindly attack the assassin if it doesn’t knows his general location. The hidden condition expires at the end of the assassin’s initiative if he moves or attacks. It also terminates if the cover, dim light, or darkness no longer conceals the assassin from his opponents.</p>\n<p><strong>Shadowy Senses:</strong> Since the bright light of torches will reveal their positions, assassins learn to rely on superior night-vision, keen hearing and smell, and echolocation to slowly scout through dark alleys, lightless dungeons, and star-lit rooftops. When moving at combat speed or exploration speed, an assassin can “see” as if he were carrying a light source that sheds dim light in a 30’ radius. Shadowy senses can be used to fight, probe for traps, and so on. However, shadowy senses cannot be used to discern colors, faces, markings, or flat images (such as frescoes and murals) or to read books, maps, or scrolls. Shadowy senses does not function if the assassin is charging or running, if deafened, or if in an area of magical darkness or magical silence. Because it counts as dim light, an opponent can hide from shadowy senses.</p>\n<p><strong>Sneaking:</strong> Assassins learn to prowl with great stealth. An assassin can begin sneaking as a movement action. He can sneak at his encounter speed or one-half combat speed without penalty. If he moves greater than half his combat speed, he takes a -5 penalty to the Sneaking proficiency throw. If he runs, he takes a -10 penalty.</p>\n<p>When the assassin begins sneaking, the Judge must make a Sneaking proficiency throw on behalf of the assassin. An assassin will always think he is successful in this skill, and will not know otherwise until others react to his presence. Regardless of whether the throw succeeds, opponents encountering the assassin suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls if the assassin is outside their line of sight.</p>\n<p>If the throw succeeds, the assassin is also <strong>sneaking</strong>. If the throw fails, the assassin is not sneaking. When sneaking, the assassin makes no noise when he moves — none whatsoever. Even alert creatures that make a successful Listening proficiency throw will not hear a sound. When a sneaking assassin engages an unengaged opponent from the rear, the opponent cannot make a free facing change.</p>\n<p><strong>Streetwise:</strong> The assassin has learned the hard lessons taught by life as a criminal. He might begin play as a member of an assassin’s guild or other criminal syndicate (Judge’s discretion). He can engage in hijinks if he has the necessary proficiencies or thief skills. He can automatically identify gestures, signs, slang, and territory of criminal organizations in his home settlement. He can identify those of other urban settlements with a proficiency throw of 11+. Secret organizations or organizations in far-off cities might be harder to recognize. (This class power is equivalent to one rank of Streetwise proficiency.)</p>\n"

In the Auran Empire, such a bard might be an adventuring minstrel with a sword in his hand and a song at his lips, a warrior-skald of the Jutland kingdoms, or a haughty Kemeshi aristocrat.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Bard Level Progression</strong></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Experience</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Title</strong></td>\n<td></td>\n<td><strong>Level</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Hit</strong>  <strong>Dice</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Damage</strong>  <strong>Bonus</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Arcane Dabbling</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Listening</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Loremastery</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>Reciter</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1d4</td>\n<td>+1</td>\n<td>4+</td>\n<td>14+</td>\n<td>18+</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1,750</td>\n<td>Versifier</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2d4</td>\n<td>+1</td>\n<td>4+</td>\n<td>13+</td>\n<td>17+</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3,500</td>\n<td>Archivist</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3d4</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td>4+</td>\n<td>12+</td>\n<td>16+</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7,000</td>\n<td>Annalist</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4d4</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td>4+</td>\n<td>11+</td>\n<td>15+</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14,000</td>\n<td>Chronicler</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>5d4</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td>4+</td>\n<td>10+</td>\n<td>14+</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>28,000</td>\n<td>Panegyrist</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>6d4</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td>4+</td>\n<td>9+</td>\n<td>13+</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>56,000</td>\n<td>Skald</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>7d4</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td>4+</td>\n<td>8+</td>\n<td>12+</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>110,000</td>\n<td>Rhapsodist</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>8d4</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td>4+</td>\n<td>7+</td>\n<td>11+</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>220,000</td>\n<td>Bard</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>9d4</td>\n<td>+4</td>\n<td>4+</td>\n<td>6+</td>\n<td>10+</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>320,000</td>\n<td>Bard, 10th level</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>9d4 + 2*</td>\n<td>+4</td>\n<td>4+</td>\n<td>5+</td>\n<td>9+</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>420,000</td>\n<td>Bard, 11th level</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>9d4 + 4*</td>\n<td>+4</td>\n<td>4+</td>\n<td>4+</td>\n<td>8+</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>520,000</td>\n<td>Bard, 12th level</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>9d4 + 6*</td>\n<td>+5</td>\n<td>4+</td>\n<td>3+</td>\n<td>7+</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>620,000</td>\n<td>Bard, 13th level</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>9d4 + 8*</td>\n<td>+5</td>\n<td>4+</td>\n<td>2+</td>\n<td>6+</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>720,000</td>\n<td>Master Bard</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>9d4 + 10*</td>\n<td>+5</td>\n<td>4+</td>\n<td>1+</td>\n<td>5+</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td>*No adjustment from Constitution applies to this flat bonus.</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n"

      "title": "Starting Class Powers",
      "level": 6,
      "html": "<p>At the start of play, bards have the following class powers. As with thieves, some of the bard’s throws improve as he gains levels according to the progression shown on the Bard Level Progression table.</p>\n<p><strong>Arcane Dabbling:</strong> Bards are prone to dabble in the arcane. They can attempt to use wands, staffs, and other magic items only usable by arcane casters. The bard does not need to know the command word for the item, but he must make a proficiency throw of 4+ on 1d20 or the attempt backfires in some desultory way (Judge’s discretion).</p>\n<p><strong>Inspire Courage:</strong> By reciting heroic lays and epic poems, bards can improve the effectiveness of their allies. Inspiring courage requires a few moments of oration before a battle (one round), and makes up to 30 of the bard’s allies within a 50’ radius <strong>inspired</strong>. An inspired creature gains a +1 bonus to attack throws, armor class, morale rolls (for monsters or NPCs allied with the caster), and saving throws against magical <strong>fear</strong>. The bonus lasts for 10 minutes (1 turn). A bard can inspire courage once per day per class level. (Even the most inspired epic gets stale if you hear it twice in the same day.) A bard cannot inspire courage on characters who are already <strong>engaged</strong> in combat.</p>\n<p><strong>Jack of All Trades:</strong> Being habitually curious jacks-of-all-trades, bards pick up an array of skills that vary widely. The bard can learn a class proficiency from any class; a thief skill (excluding backstab); a venturer class power (excluding mercantile network); or other class power approved by the Judge, excluding spellcasting powers. The bard cannot select a class power when the bard’s class level is lower than the class level at which that power becomes available to its default class. For instance, he could not select Rumormongering at 1st level because it doesn’t become available to venturers until 4th level. Note that some selections might not be useful; e.g. the bard has no spells to regain with Contemplation, so that proficiency isn’t ever a good choice.</p>\n<p><strong>Listening:</strong> Bards have sharp ears that permit them to hear noises in caves, hallways, at a door, or other locations. The Judge makes a Listening proficiency throw in secret on behalf of the bard. If the throw succeeds, he hears any noises in earshot. If the throw fails, or if there aren’t any noises in earshot, he doesn’t hear anything. The bard must be quiet and must be the closest creature in the party relative to the location of the sound or suspected sound. Listening only requires one round but can only be undertaken once per turn (10 minutes) if the party is moving at all, because it takes time for people to settle down into quiet.</p>\n<p><strong>Loremastery:</strong> The bard can make a proficiency throw of 18+ to decipher occult runes, remember ancient history, or identify a historic artifact or special monster part. The proficiency throw required reduces by 1 per level. He can also identify magic items as if he were a 5th level mage. (This class power is the equivalent of Loremastery proficiency.)</p>\n<p><strong>Multilingual:</strong> Because they travel widely and converse freely, bards become conversant in a wide variety of tongues. They gain three bonus languages. The bard can select some or all of these languages immediately from among those in common use in the campaign’s starting region or select them later from among those he encounters in play. (This class power is the equivalent of one rank of Language proficiency.)</p>\n<p><strong>Performance:</strong> The bard has been trained in a performing art such as chanting, reciting poetry, singing, or playing an instrument. He can earn 10gp per month from working as a street performer or tavern entertainer. He can identify renowned performers, famous works, and unusual songs with a proficiency throw of 11+. (This class power is equivalent to one rank of Performance proficiency.)</p>\n"

Deciphering a page of text requires one turn (10 minutes) and a successful proficiency throw of 4+ on 1d20. If the roll does not succeed, the bard cannot try to decipher that particular page of text until he reaches a higher level of experience.</p>\n<p><strong>Chronicles of Battle (5th):</strong> The bard’s songs and stories inspire his hirelings to strive for glory. Any henchmen and mercenaries hired by the bard gain a +1 bonus to their morale score while the bard is present to witness and record their deeds. This bonus stacks with any modifiers from the bard’s Charisma or proficiencies.</p>\n<p><strong>Jack of All Trades III (6th level):</strong> The bard can learn another class proficiency from any class, thief skill (excluding backstab), venturer class power (excluding mercantile network), or other class power approved by the Judge, excluding spellcasting.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Max HP</td>\n<td>Temp HP Gained</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1 – 3</td>\n<td>1d2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4 – 9</td>\n<td>1d3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10 – 16</td>\n<td>1d4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17 – 23</td>\n<td>1d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>24 – 29</td>\n<td>1d8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>30 – 36</td>\n<td>1d10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>37 – 49</td>\n<td>2d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>50 – 63</td>\n<td>2d8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>64 – 76</td>\n<td>2d10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>77 – 89</td>\n<td>2d12</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>90 – 110</td>\n<td>3d10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>111 – 140</td>\n<td>4d10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>141 – 170</td>\n<td>5d10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>171+</td>\n<td>6d10, plus 1d10  per 30 hp past 170</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Inspire Hope (7th):</strong> By recounting the glorious deeds of old, bards can brighten the darkest moment. Inspiring hope requires a few moments of oration (one round), and grants up to 30 of the bard’s allies within 30’ a pool of temporary hit points. The number of hit points gained by each ally is determined on the adjoining table based on the bard’s or the ally’s max hit points (whichever is lower). These temporary hit points last for one turn (10 minutes), until lost to damage, or until the bard inspires hope on the ally again, whichever comes first. The bard can inspire hope once per day at 7th level, and one additional time per day with each level thereafter.</p>\n<p><strong>Jack of All Trades IV (8th level):</strong> The bard can learn another class proficiency from any class, thief skill (excluding backstab), venturer class power (excluding mercantile network), or other class power approved by the Judge, excluding spellcasting.</p>\n<p><strong>Great Hall (9th level):</strong> By acquiring a <strong>great hall</strong> worth at least 15,000gp, the bard can attract followers to his service. 5d6 x 10 0th level troops and 1d6 bards of 1st – 3rd level arrive to serve him within 1d3 months of him acquiring the hall. If the bard already has a hall, the followers arrive to serve him within 1d3 months of him reaching 9th level. The bard must pay his followers the ordinary rates for mercenaries and henchmen or they leave his service. Additional rules for great halls are detailed in the <strong>Campaigns</strong> chapter.</p>\n<p><strong>Scrollreading (10th):</strong> The bard gains the ability to read and cast magic from arcane and divine scrolls. The bard does not have to be able to read the language in which the scroll is written provided he has successfully deciphered it before. Reading a magical scroll requires one round and a successful proficiency throw of 4+ on 1d20. However, a failed throw means the spell does not function as expected, and can create a horrible effect at the Judge’s discretion.</p>\n<p><strong>Jack of All Trades V (11th level):</strong> The bard can learn another class proficiency from any class, thief skill (excluding backstab), venturer class power (excluding mercantile network), or other class power approved by the Judge, excluding spellcasting.</p>\n"

If a bladedancer is wearing light armor, very light armor, or no armor, and carrying 5 stones or less encumbrance, she gains a +1 bonus to initiative and a +1 bonus to Armor Class.

See the <strong>Spells</strong> chapter for a list of all available spells.</p>\n<p><strong>Strength of Faith:</strong> When the bladedancer strikes a foe, the goddess lends her strength to the blow. The bladedancer can apply her WIL modifier instead of her STR modifier on any damage roll affected by STR.</p>\n<p><strong>Theology:</strong> Every bladedancer receives religious instruction at an abbey, cloister, or temple. She can begin play as a member of a religious hierarchy (Judge’s discretion). She can acquire congregants through proselytizing. She can automatically identify religious symbols, spell signatures, trappings, and holy days of her own faith, and can recognize those of other faiths with a proficiency throw of 11+. Rare or occult cults might be harder to recognize. (This class power is the equivalent of one rank of Theology proficiency.)</p>\n<p><strong>Weapon Finesse:</strong> Bladedancers fight with lissome speed and cat-like agility. A bladedancer can apply her DEX modifier instead of her STR modifier on her melee attack throws when using weapons with which she is proficient. (This class power is the equivalent of Weapon Finesse proficiency, except that it applies to the bladedancer’s specific weapons rather than to all tiny, small, or medium weapons.

      "html": "<p>In exchange for their devotion to Law, paladins receive many powers to aid them in their crusades against Chaos. At the start of play, paladins have the following class powers:</p>\n<p><strong>Aura of Protection:</strong> Paladins are protected by a magical aura that grants them a +1 bonus to AC and a +1 bonus to saving throws against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures. The paladin’s aura of protection appears as a golden halo when viewed with <em>discern good, discern magic,</em> or <em>true seeing.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Lay on Hands:</strong> By calling on the higher powers of Law, the paladin can lay on hands to heal injuries. If he lays hands on a wounded creature, he can restore 2 hit points per experience level. If he lays hands on an incapacitated creature, he can grant a bonus to their Mortal Wounds throw of one-half his class level (round up). If he lays hands on a paralyzed creature, he can cure the paralysis. The paladin can use his power to lay on hands once per day. He can select the Laying on Hands proficiency to gain additional uses of the power per day. (This class power is the equivalent of one rank of Laying on Hands proficiency).</p>\n<p><strong>Manual of Arms:</strong> The paladin is highly experienced in military discipline, physical fitness, and weapon drill. He can automatically identify the battle standards, equipment, great captains, military slang, and rank insignia of his homeland. He can identify those of other realms with a proficiency throw of 11+. He can fight as a regular (rather than irregular) troop in formed and loose units. He can begin play as a member of a legion, mercenary’s guild, or other military organization (Judge’s discretion). (This class power is equivalent to one rank of the Manual of Arms proficiency.)</p>\n<p><strong>Sanctified Body:</strong> Paladins are completely immune to the ravages of disease, including magical diseases. This enables them to go on long crusades without succumbing to the illnesses that kill many soldiers, as well as to face dread foes such as mummies or werewolves without fear of corruption. (This class power is the equivalent of the Divine Health proficiency.)</p>\n<p><strong>Sense Evil:</strong> The paladin can detect creatures with evil intentions, magic items with evil enchantments, sinkholes of evil, enchanted creatures of Chaotic alignment, incarnations of Chaotic alignment, and undead within 45’. Other types of creatures, even if Chaotic, are not detected unless they have actively evil intentions against the paladin. Poisons, physical traps, and natural animals are neither good nor evil, so they are not detected by this spell. The paladin sees the evil creatures or objects with a sinister red glow around them, but the glow cannot be seen by anyone else. The paladin must have line of sight on the evil (e.g. the power does not work through walls). If the creature or object is hidden or invisible, the paladin will only see the glow and not the source of the evil. Sensing evil requires one full round of quiet concentration to activate. The effect lasts as long as the paladin continues to concentrate, to a maximum of one round per level. The effect can be used once per turn (10 minutes).

Most of these priestesses fall prey to the world or its temptations, but a few rise in power and broaden the reach and influence of their order.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Priestess Level Progression</strong></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td><strong>Priestess Spell Progression</strong></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Experience</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Title</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Level</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Hit Dice</strong></td>\n<td></td>\n<td><strong>1</strong></td>\n<td><strong>2</strong></td>\n<td><strong>3</strong></td>\n<td><strong>4</strong></td>\n<td><strong>5</strong></td>\n<td><strong>6</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>Novice</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1d4</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2,000</td>\n<td>Daughter</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2d4</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4,000</td>\n<td>Sister-Initiate</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3d4</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8,000</td>\n<td>Sister</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4d4</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16,000</td>\n<td>Sister-Disciple</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>5d4</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>32,000</td>\n<td>Priestess</td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>6d4</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>65,000</td>\n<td>Mother</td>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>7d4</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>130,000</td>\n<td>Revered Mother</td>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>8d4</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>230,000</td>\n<td>Matriarch</td>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>9d4</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>330,000</td>\n<td>Matriarch, 10th level</td>\n<td>10*</td>\n<td>9d4 + 1</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>430,000</td>\n<td>Matriarch, 11th level</td>\n<td>11*</td>\n<td>9d4 + 2</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>530,000</td>\n<td>Matriarch, 12th level</td>\n<td>12*</td>\n<td>9d4 + 3</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>630,000</td>\n<td>Matriarch, 13th level</td>\n<td>13*</td>\n<td>9d4 + 4</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>730,000</td>\n<td>High Priestess</td>\n<td>14*</td>\n<td>9d4 + 5</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>*No adjustment from Constitution applies to this flat bonus.</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n"

Each use of the ability requires 1 turn (10 minutes), during which the target creature is reassured through prayer and pastoral guidance. Once consoled, the creature’s natural healing from resting is doubled for the next day. The priestess cannot console wounded creatures of a different alignment or religion, nor can she console creatures that aren’t sapient. This ability only applies to healing from resting.</p>\n<p><strong>Diplomacy:</strong> In order to carry out missionary work, priestesses are trained in the art of protocol. They receive a +1 bonus on all reaction rolls when they attempt to parley with intelligent creatures. (This class power is equivalent to one rank of Diplomacy proficiency.)</p>\n<p><strong>Divine Magic:</strong> Priestesses can manifest their goddess’s power in the form of divine spells, which are granted through prayer and worship.

See the <strong>Spells</strong> chapter for a list of all available spells.</p>\n<p><strong>Lay on Hands:</strong> By calling on her goddess, the priestess can lay on hands to heal injuries. If she lays hands on a wounded creature, she can restore 2 hit points per experience level. If she lays hands on an incapacitated creature, she can grant a bonus to their Mortal Wounds throw of one-half his class level (round up). If she lays hands on a paralyzed creature, she can cure the paralysis. The priestess can use her power to lay on hands once per day. She can select the Laying on Hands proficiency to gain additional uses of the power per day. (This class power is the equivalent of one rank of Laying on Hands proficiency).</p>\n<p><strong>Purity of the Body:</strong> The goddess shelters her priestesses from the effects of pestilence, so they can better minister to the sick and dying. The priestess is immune to all forms of disease, including magical diseases caused by spells, mummies, or lycanthropes.</p>\n<p><strong>Theology:</strong> Every priestess receives religious instruction at an abbey, cloister, or temple. She can begin play as a member of a religious hierarchy (Judge’s discretion). She can acquire congregants through proselytizing. She can automatically identify religious symbols, spell signatures, trappings, and holy days of her own faith, and can recognize those of other faiths with a proficiency throw of 11+.

He can begin play as a shaman of an existing tribe in the region (Judge’s discretion). He can acquire congregants through proselytizing. He can automatically identify religious symbols, spell signatures, trappings, and holy days of his own tribal traditions, and can recognize those of other faiths with a proficiency throw of 11+. Rare or occult cults might be harder to recognize. (This class power is equivalent to one rank of Theology proficiency).</p>\n<p><strong>Totem Animal:</strong> Every shaman has a <strong>totem animal</strong> as a companion. The totem animal physically represents the shaman’s relationship with his sacred powers. The Totem Animals table, below, lists the benefits and abilities of several sample totems. The Judge can create additional totems at his discretion. The totem animal should be a creature appropriate to the character’s attributes and tribal traditions. For example, a shaman with high STR might have a bear totem, while a shaman with high WIL might have an owl totem and one with high CHA might choose an eagle totem. At a minimum, the shaman must possess an attribute of at least 9 in his totem animal’s key attribute. Over time, the shaman will come to resemble his totem animal. A wolf shaman might develop yellow eyes and sharp canines, while a bear shaman might grow husky and hirsute.</p>\n<p>The totem animal has human-like intelligence, with Intellect equal to half the shaman’s Intellect. It can understand the shaman’s speech, and the shaman can understand his totem animal’s speech, though no one else can without resorting to <em>speak with beasts</em>.So long as the shaman upholds his tribal traditions, the totem animal will be utterly loyal to the shaman and will fight for him, perform services, and obey his commands.</p>\n<p>While the totem animal is alive, the shaman receives the animal’s <strong>totem benefit</strong>. The totem benefit is a bonus proficiency related to the totem. For example, a shaman with a cobra totem animal has the Combat Reflexes proficiency so long as he is within 30’ of his totem animal.</p>\n<p>Because it is partly a creature of the shaman’s own spirit, the totem animal always has a number of Hit Dice equal to one less than the shaman’s own (1/2 HD when the shaman is 1st level) with 4 hp per HD. If a totem animal has fewer Hit Dice than those normally possessed by such an animal, it will appear as a smaller, younger creature of its type. If it has more HD, it will appear as a larger, fiercer variant. The animal’s baseline characteristics are adjusted based on its current Hit Dice relative to the Hit Dice of an ordinary animal of its type:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Attack throws are as a monster of its HD; saving throws are as a fighter of half its HD.</li>\n<li>AC increases or decreases by 1 per 2 HD of difference, to a minimum of 0 and maximum of its own ordinary HD. (Round differences of 0.5 to even).</li>\n<li>Average damage for its attack routine (as a whole) increases or decreases by 2 per HD of difference. The Judge should decide how this is manifested, e.g. does it have a bigger bite, sharper claws, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>EXAMPLE: A shaman calls a lion totem animal. An ordinary lion has AC 3, HD 5, and an attack routine consisting of 2 claws (1d4+1) and 1 bite (1d10). Its average damage is (3.5 + 3.5 + 5.5) = 12.5 per attack routine. When the shaman is 1st level, his totem animal appears as a lion cub. It has 1/2 HD, making it 4.5 HD less than an ordinary lion. 4.5 is rounded to 4. AC is decreased by 1 per 2 HD of difference, so the lion cub’s AC is reduced from 3 to 1. Average damage decreases by 2 per HD of difference, so average damage is reduced by 8 points, from 12.5 to 4.5 The Judge decides it attacks with 2 claws (1d3-1) and 1 bite (1d4). When the shaman is 6th level, his totem animal has 5 HD, so it has the characteristics of an ordinary lion. When the shaman is 14th level, his totem animal has 13 HD, making it 8 HD more than an ordinary lion. AC is increased by 4, capped at its ordinary HD of 5. Average damage is increased by 16, to 28.5. the Judge decides it attacks with 2 claws (2d6) and 1 bite (3d8+1).</p>\n<p>If the totem animal is ever killed, the shaman must save versus Death or instantly take damage equal to the totem animal’s maximum total hit points. If a shaman’s totem animal is slain, it can’t be <em>restored<strong>to</strong>life</em>or <em>resurrected</em>.However, a new totem animal of the same type will appear the next time the shaman gains a level of experience. Except where mentioned above, totem animals have the characteristics of a normal animal of their type. These are listed on the Totem Animals table for quick reference; see the <em><strong>ACKS II Monstrous Manual</strong></em>for full details. HD are listed for comparison purposes. The Judge can devise new totem animals if desired.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Totem Animals</strong></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Totem Animal</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Key Attribute</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Totem Benefit</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Characteristics</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Bear</td>\n<td>STR</td>\n<td>Berserkergang</td>\n<td>Spd 120’, AC 3, HD 4, #AT 3, Dmg 1d3/1d3/1d6, hug</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cheetah</td>\n<td>DEX</td>\n<td>Running</td>\n<td>Spd 360’, AC 5, HD 2+2, #AT 3, Dmg 1d2/1d2/1d4, pounce</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Crocodile</td>\n<td>CON</td>\n<td>Combat Ferocity</td>\n<td>Spd 60’/90’ swim, AC 4, HD 2, #AT 1, Dmg 1d8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Crow/Raven</td>\n<td>INT</td>\n<td>Divine Blessing</td>\n<td>Spd 330’ fly, AC 1, HD ¼, #AT 1, Dmg 1d2-1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Dog</td>\n<td>CHA</td>\n<td>Alertness</td>\n<td>Spd 180’, AC 2, HD 1+1, #AT 1, Dmg 1d4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Eagle/Hawk</td>\n<td>CHA</td>\n<td>Command</td>\n<td>Spd 480’ fly, AC 3, HD 1+1, #AT 2, Dmg 1d3/1d3, dive</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Elk</td>\n<td>CON</td>\n<td>Contemplation</td>\n<td>Spd 180’, AC 2, HD 4, #AT 1, Dmg 1d10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Goat</td>\n<td>WIL</td>\n<td>Climbing</td>\n<td>Spd 150’, AC 2, HD 1, Dmg 1d4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Horse</td>\n<td>CON</td>\n<td>Mounted Combat</td>\n<td>Spd 210’, AC 2, HD 2, #AT 2, Dmg 1d4/1d4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Hyena</td>\n<td>CHA</td>\n<td>Weapon Focus</td>\n<td>Spd 150’, AC 2, HD 2+1, #AT 2, Dmg 1d8, bone crush</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Jackal</td>\n<td>INT</td>\n<td>Combat Trickery</td>\n<td>Spd 180’, AC 2, HD 1-1, #AT 1, Dmg 1d4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Lion</td>\n<td>STR</td>\n<td>Divine Health</td>\n<td>Spd 180’, AC 3, HD 5, #AT 3, Dmg 1d4+1/1d4+1/1d10, pounce</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Monkey</td>\n<td>DEX</td>\n<td>Prestidigitation</td>\n<td>Spd 120’, AC 2, HD 1, #AT 1, Dmg 1d3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Rat</td>\n<td>WIL</td>\n<td>Quiet Magic</td>\n<td>Spd 120’/ 60’ swim, AC 2, HD 1/2, #AT 1, Dmg 1d3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Owl</td>\n<td>INT</td>\n<td>Sensing Power</td>\n<td>Spd 300’ fly, AC 3, HD ½, #AT 2, Dmg 1d2/1d2, dive attack</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Python</td>\n<td>STR</td>\n<td>Laying on Hands</td>\n<td>Spd 90’, AC 3, HD 5, #AT 2, Dmg 1d4/2d8, constriction</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Viper</td>\n<td>DEX</td>\n<td>Combat Reflexes</td>\n<td>Spd 90’, AC 3, HD 2, #AT 1, Dmg 1d4, poison</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Wolf</td>\n<td>WIL</td>\n<td>Ambushing</td>\n<td>Spd 180’, AC 2, HD 2+2, #AT 1, Dmg 1d6</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n"

      "html": "<p>When they advance in level, shamans gain the following additional class powers:</p>\n<p><strong>Spiritual Ritual (3rd level):</strong> The shaman can perform a spiritual ritual to re-gain the ability to cast a spell of a level he had previously expended. Each spiritual ritual requires one hour (6 turns). In contrast to the austere contemplation of more civilized crusaders, spiritual rituals involve ecstatic dancing, wild drumming, chanting, and intoxicating smoke. The shaman can perform a spiritual ritual as often as desired, but cannot regain the same level of spell more than once per day.</p>\n<p><strong>Minor Magical Research (5th level):</strong> At 5th level or higher, the shaman can scribe scrolls and brew potions.</p>\n<p><strong>Shapechanging (5th level):</strong> The physical link between the shaman and his totem becomes strong enough for the shaman to <strong>shapechange</strong> into his totem animal. The shaman remains in his new shape until he changes back. A 5th level shaman can initially shapechange once per day. For example, if he begins the day in human form, he can shapechange into his totem animal form, but he then has to remain in totem animal form until the following day, when he can change back to his human shape. With each level of experience gained, the shaman can change shape one additional time per day.</p>\n<p>When in totem animal form, the shaman has the movement, armor class, attacks, damage, and powers listed on the Totem Animals table. He retains his normal Hit Dice, hit points, attack throws, and saving throws. If the shaman is of greater Hit Dice than his animal type, he will appear as a bigger, stronger version of the animal, to a maximum of twice normal size. For example, a 10th level shaman in lion shape would appear as a huge predator, twice the mass of a normal lion. Apart from size, the shaman is indistinguishable from a normal animal. The totem animal shape does not detect as magical, is not detected by spells that reveal illusions, and cannot be <strong>dispelled</strong>. Changing shape can be performed during combat as an action in lieu of an attack.</p>\n<p><strong>Spiritwalking (7th level):</strong> The shaman’s spiritual powers have grown strong enough for him to spiritwalk. After 1 turn (10 minutes) of chanting, the shaman enters a deep trance during which his spirit walks free of his body. A spiritwalking shaman’s spirit can assume either human or totem animal shape as desired. The effects are otherwise identical to the 5th level spell <em>spiritwalk.</em> Spiritwalking is so taxing that it can be performed but once per week.</p>\n<p><strong>Major Magical Research (9th level):</strong> The shaman can create more powerful magic items such as weapons, rings, and staffs.</p>\n<p><strong>Medicine Lodge (9th level):</strong> By acquiring a <strong>medicine lodge</strong> worth at least 15,000gp, the shaman can attract followers to his service. So long as the shaman is currently in favor with his tribe’s powers, he can build his lodge at half the normal price due to divine intervention. 5d6 x 10 0th level tribesmen and 1d6 shamans of 1st level of the same tribe arrive to serve him within 1d3 months of him acquiring the medicine lodge. If the shaman has already acquired a medicine lodge, the followers arrive to serve him within 1d3 months of him reaching 9th level. The followers are fanatically brave and completely loyal (loyalty +4 and morale +4). Despite their loyalty, the followersmust be paid a fair wage or they might eventually leave his service. Additional rules for medicine lodges are detailed in the <strong>Campaign</strong> chapter.</p>\n<p><strong>Supreme Magical Research (11th level):</strong> The shaman can learn and cast ritual divine spells of great power (7th, 8th, and 9th level) and craft magical constructs.

If the warlock already has a sanctum, the followers arrive to serve him within 1d3 months of him reaching 9th level. The apprentices function as assistants in magical research (see p. XXX). If performing magic research, the apprentices must be provided food and lodging, but need not be paid wages. (If asked to accompany the mage on adventure, the apprentices must be paid wages as henchmen.) If the warlock builds a <strong>dungeon</strong> beneath or near his sanctum, monsters will start to arrive to dwell within, often followed by adventurers seeking to fight them. Additional rules for <strong>sanctums</strong> are detailed in the <strong>Campaigns</strong> chapter (p. XX).</p>\n<p><strong>Dark Path VI (11th level):</strong> The warlock’s dark path grants him his sixth reward.</p>\n<p><strong>Supreme Magical Research (11th level):</strong> The warlock can learn and cast ritual arcane spells of great power (7th, 8th, and 9th level), craft magical constructs, and create magical cross-breeds.

      "html": "<p>Demonology</p>\n<p><strong>Conjure Dark Powers (1st level):</strong> When the demonologist casts summoning spells (such as<em>conjure fiend</em>or <em>summon**shadows</em>), the spell effects are calculated as if he were two caster levels higher than his actual level of experience. (This makes them harder to dispel.) If the character loses his concentration due to taking damage while controlling a conjured creature, he must make a Spells saving throw. If the save succeeds, he maintains his concentration. His eligibility to conduct research on summoning magic is determined as if he were two caster levels higher than actual. He gains a +2 bonus on magic research throws and increases his research rate by 10% when researching summoning magic. Conjure Dark Powers can stack with the Mastery of Conjuration and Summoning proficiency, such that the character’s summoning spells and research are calculated as if he were three (rather than two) caster levels higher and he gains a +2 bonus on his Spells saving throw to maintain concentration.</p>\n<p><strong>Theology (3rd level):</strong> The demonologist has become a cultist of the chthonic powers. He gains one rank of the Theology proficiency.</p>\n<p><strong>Conjure Hellion (5th level):</strong> The demonologist has made pacts with demon lords. He can cast <em>conjure hellion</em>once per day.</p>\n<p>**Expanded Repertoire (7th level):**The demonologist gains an expanded repertoire, increasing the number of slots in his repertoire of each level that he can cast by one. He must learn the specific spells separately. The additional spells must be conjuration or summoning spells, learned either from studying existing spells or by magic research of new spells.</p>\n<p><strong>Words of Command and Obedience (9th):</strong> The demonologistcan compel his conjured and summoned creatures to obey his inexorable will. Any creatures summoned by the demonologist will obey him to the best of their ability rather than seek to pervert his intention. Any creatures he conjures will depart without harming him if his concentration is broken.</p>\n<p><strong>Power of Sacrifice (11th level):</strong> Bargaining with the infernal powers has taught the demonologist the power of sacrifice. He can gain arcane power by blood sacrifice, and counts any arcane power from blood sacrifice as double its gp value. He can store the arcane power from blood sacrifices indefinitely, even when not actively performing magical research. See the rules for Arcane Power (p. XX) and Blood Sacrifice (p. XX).</p>\n<p>Necromancy</p>\n<p><strong>Secrets of the Dark Arts (1st):</strong> The necromancer can control undead as a Chaotic crusader of one half his class level. If the character casts death spells, his targets suffer a -2 penalty on their saving throws. When the character casts necromantic spells (such as <em>animate undead</em>), the spell effects are calculated as if he were two class levels higher than his actual level of experience. His eligibility to research death or necromancy magic is determined as if he were two caster levels higher than actual. He gains a +2 bonus on magic research throws and increases his research rate by 10% when researching death or necromancy magic. Secrets of the Dark Arts can stack with the Black Lore of Zahar proficiency, such that the character can control undead as a crusader of two-thirds his class level (rounded up), and his death and necromancy spells and research are calculated as if he were three (rather than two) caster levels higher than his actual caster level.</p>\n<p><strong>Mortuary Science (3rd):</strong> The necromancer has undertaken a deep study of anatomy, circulation, disease, and vitality. He gains one rank of the Healing proficiency.</p>\n<p><strong>Speak with Dead (5th)</strong><em>:</em> The dead hold no secrets for the necromancer. He can cast <em>speak with the dead</em>once per day.</p>\n<p>**Expanded Repertoire (7th level):**The necromancer gains an expanded repertoire, increasing the number of slots in his repertoire of each level that he can cast by one. He must learn the specific spells separately. The additional spells must be death and necromancy spells, learned either from studying existing spells or by magic research of new spells.</p>\n<p><strong>Lordship Over the Undead (9th)</strong><em>:</em> In black tomes and evil liturgies, the necromancer has gained lordship over the undead. Whenever the character succeeds in controlling undead (whether from a roll or automatically from a “R” result), the undead are controlled for 1 day per level instead of the usual 1 turn per level. If the undead would have been controlled for 1 day per level (from a “D” result), the undead are instead controlled indefinitely.</p>\n<p><strong>Secrets of Life and Death (11th):</strong> The necromancer has finally unlocked the secrets of life and death. He can perform necromancy at half the usual material cost and research cost.</p>\n<p>Transmogrification</p>\n<p><strong>Grotesque Arts of Transformation (1st):</strong> When the character casts transmogrification spells, the spell effects are calculated as if he were two class levels higher than his actual level of experience. His eligibility to create crossbreeds or research transmogrification magic is determined as if he were two caster levels higher than actual. Targets of his transmogrification spells suffer a -2 penalty to their saving throw. He gains a +2 bonus on magic research throws and increases his research rate by 10% when creating crossbreeds or researching transmogrification magic. Grotesque Arts can stack with the Transmogrification proficiency, such that the character’s transmogrification spells are calculated as if he were three (rather than two) caster levels higher and his bonus to magic research and research rate is increased to +3 and 15%.</p>\n<p><strong>Alchemy (3rd level)</strong>:To master the art of transmogrification one must unravel the secrets of alchemy. The character gains one rank of the Alchemy proficiency.</p>\n<p><strong>Skinchange (5th level)</strong>: The transmogrifier has learned to transcend his own form. He can cast <em>skinchange</em>once per day.</p>\n<p>**Expanded Repertoire (7th level):**The transmogrifier gains an expanded repertoire, increasing the number of slots in his repertoire of each level that he can cast by one. He must learn the specific spells separately. The additional spells must be transmogrification spells, learned either from studying existing spells or by magic research of new spells.</p>\n<p><strong>Hideous Servant (9th level):</strong> Experiments combining living creatures with the transmogrifier’s own flesh and blood have created a hideous servantintimately bonded to his will. The hideous servant is mechanically similar to a shaman’s totem animal (see p. XX).However, the sorcerer selects two of his hideous servant’s characteristics (AC, movement, attack routine, and special abilities) from one animal and two characteristics from another, while the servant’s base Hit Dice are set to the average of the two animals selected. (Remember that actual HD will be adjusted by the character’s level.) He does not gain a totem benefit.</p>\n<p><strong>Shape Flesh and Bone (11th level):</strong> The transmogrifier can mold flesh and bone like clay. The character is able to create magical crossbreeds at half the usual material cost and research cost.</p>\n"

      "html": "<p>Though it grants them great power, the dark path tread by the warlock carries a terrible cost. At 1st level, and again at 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, and 11th level, the warlock is afflicted by a <strong>corrupting weakness.</strong> The Judge can pick from the list below or ask the player to roll 1d10:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Disfigured:</strong> Sorcerous studies have begun to make the warlock a monstrous figure, leaving him misshapen limbs, clawed hands or feet, hideous scarring, strangely colored eyes, and so on. Each disfigurement imposes a -2 penalty to reaction rolls with sapient creatures of Lawful or Neutral alignment.</li>\n<li><strong>Distrusted</strong>: Lore best left unstudied has twisted the warlock’s demeanor and personality. A reaction roll with sapient creatures of Lawful or Neutral alignment can never achieve a friendly (12+) result. Each time this weakness is selected thereafter, reduce the best possible reaction roll by one further step.</li>\n<li><strong>Enervated</strong>: The warlock’s exploration of sinister sorcery has sapped his soul of strength and vigor. His Constitution is reduced by 2 points each time this weakness occurs.</li>\n<li><strong>Frightening to Beasts:</strong> The warlock’s corruption is unsettling to animals. They growl, hiss, rear up, and otherwise make their displeasure known whenever he is within 10’. The warlock suffers a -4 reaction roll when encountering animals or giant animals. He cannot ride normal mounts. Characters with Beast Friendship proficiency (or related class powers) can detect something is unnatural about the warlock, but do not suffer a reaction roll penalty. If the warlock himself had Beast Friendship proficiency, the proficiency’s effects now only help when dealing with wild predators and scavengers, such as wolves and vultures (in which cases the above penalty will not apply).</li>\n<li><strong>Haunted:</strong> Whispers from the beyond plague the warlock. They are difficult to ignore, and impose a -2 penalty to listening throws and -1 penalty to initiative and surprise rolls. The penalty is cumulative each time this weakness occurs.</li>\n<li><strong>Mad:</strong> So disturbing are the warlock’s dark secrets that he has begun to lose his grip on reality. Each day he must make a Spells saving throw or go <strong>mad</strong> for 1 – 10 hours. The warlock’s first saving throw against madness is at +20, but each consecutive saving throw is one point less advantaged. When the warlock goes mad, he falls under the Judge’s control for 1d10 hours, during which time his behavior is entirely unpredictable. The day after a bout of madness, the warlock resumes his saving throws with a +20 bonus.</li>\n<li><strong>Mutated:</strong> The corrupting influences of dark magic have begun to warp the warlock’s body. The first time this weakness occurs, roll 1d10 on the Magical Mutations sub-table (p. XX). The second time it occurs, roll 1d10+1. The third time it occurs, roll 1d10+2, and so on.</li>\n<li><strong>Nocturnal:</strong> Creatures of darkness and evil hunt by night, and sleep by day. So too does the warlock. He cannot regain spells unless he sleeps during the day. Due to his nocturnal habits, he suffers a penalty of -2 to all throws when in sunlight. This penalty is increased by an additional 2 points each time this weakness occurs.</li>\n<li><strong>Obsessed:</strong> The warlock’s self-control and will begin to erode in the face of ongoing corruption. His Will is reduced by 2 points each time this weakness occurs.</li>\n<li><strong>Sleepless:</strong> Haunted by nightmares and disturbing visions of the grave, the warlock finds it hard to sleep. Each time he attempts to rest, he must roll 1d6. On a 1, the warlock tosses and turns all night, regaining no hit points and recovering no spells. The chance of sleeplessness increases by 1 each time this weakness occurs, to a maximum of five times.</li>\n</ol>\n"

Actual witches, however, are women who practice a distinct craft of magic. Like priestesses and shamans, witches invoke divine magic, but they do not organize into communities of faith nor do they dedicate themselves to the service of their gods or goddesses. Rather, they seek to gain personal knowledge and strength by bartering with the old powers of the world. Through ancient pacts, forgotten prayers, secret names of power, and other means, they appease, bargain, coerce, convince, and harness divine power to their own ends. Their quest for knowledge and power often drives witches to become adventurers.</p>\n<p>Within the Auran Empire, witches are viewed with deep suspicion by the Empyrean priests, but many rural villages nevertheless have a wise woman with some skill in witchcraft.

In addition, each tradition grants a special ability at 1st, 3rd, 5th, and 7th level.</p>\n<p><strong>Village Wisdom (1st level):</strong> All witches can perform minor acts of “hedge magic” useful in village life, such as alleviating cold symptoms, easing the pains of childbirth, driving away bedbugs from a mattress, removing mites and ticks from a creature, and so on. Each use takes 1 turn (10 minutes). (If your Judge is using the optional rules for cantrips from <em>Axioms,</em> this class power grants the witch the ability to learn and cast divine cantrips instead.)</p>\n"

However, she cannot yet research new spells or scribe scrolls.</p>\n<p><strong>Minor Magical Research (5th level):</strong> The witch can research new spells. However, she cannot yet scribe scrolls.</p>\n<p><strong>Scribe Scrolls (7th level):</strong> The witch can create magic scrolls.</p>\n<p><strong>Witch’s Cottage (9th level:</strong> By acquiring a cottage worth at least 15,000gp, the witch can attract followers to her service. 1d6 apprentices of 1st – 3rd level plus 2d6 apprentices of 0th level arrive to serve her as followers within 1d3 months of her acquiring the cottage. If the witch already has a cottage, the followers arrive to serve her within 1d3 months of her reaching 9th level. The apprentices function as assistants in magical research (see p. XXX). If performing magic research, the apprentices must be provided food and lodging, but need not be paid wages. (If asked to accompany the witch on adventure, the apprentices must be paid wages as henchmen.) A normal woman in training typically takes 2 years to become a 1st level witch.

      "title": "Traditions",
      "level": 6,
      "html": "<p>Antiquarian Witch</p>\n<p><strong>Traditional Medicine (1st level):</strong> The antiquarian witch practices an ancient tradition of natural medicine using healing herbs. She can identify and forage for healing herbs as if she had one rank of Naturalism proficiency. (If she already has Naturalism, she gains a +4 bonus on proficiency throws to identify and forage for healing herbs.) She can use healing herbs as if she had Healing proficiency. Given one turn (10 minutes), she can combine a pound of healing herbs with an equal gp of special components to create potent healing herbs that increase their effect by +1. The witch needs a cauldron over a fire or a kitchen to make potent healing herbs. The potent herbs lose all efficacy after 24 hours.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: Bronwyn is an antiquarian witch. She has one pound of comfrey (10gp value), one pound of woundwort (10gp), and two marsh ghoul livers (10gp each). When her party camps for the night, she uses her Natural Medicine power. First, she mixes comfrey with ghoul liver to create potent comfrey that heals 1d3+1 damage. Then she mixes woundwort with ghoul liver to create potent woundwort that grants a +3 bonus to Healing throws. However, the herbs will lose their efficacy if not used within the next day.</p>\n<p><strong>Healing Arts (3rd level):</strong> The antiquarian witch’s knowledge of the healing arts deepens. She gains one rank of Healing proficiency. (If she already has three ranks of Healing proficiency, she can gain a rank of Alchemy or Naturalism instead.)</p>\n<p><strong>Second Sight (5th level):</strong> Because of the antiquarian witch’s connection with the hidden world, she can see innately or magically invisible creatures within 60’. Invisible creatures are aware that the witch can see them, and might take a particular interest in her as a result. Second Sight does not provide the ability to see creatures or features hidden through cover or darkness.</p>\n<p><strong>Magic Mirror (7th level):</strong> By directing her gaze onto a mirror, crystal, reflective pool, or other surface upon which the images can be displayed, the antiquarian witch can see visions of faraway people and places. She can cast <em>scry</em> (as the spell) once per day. Each use takes 1 turn (10 minutes). If the witch has <em>clairaudiency</em>or <em>telepathy</em>in her repertoire, she can cast either spell at the same time in order to use one of those spells while scrying.</p>\n<p>Chthonic Witch</p>\n<p><strong>Bedazzling Glamour (1st level)</strong>: Vain and narcissistic, the chthonic witch has learned how to use magical glamour to conceal her imperfections. While active, the glamour grants her three benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The witch gains a +1 bonus to all reaction rolls. This bonus does not stack with Mystic Aura (though the other effects do).</li>\n<li>The witch does not suffer any age-related penalty to CHA.</li>\n<li>Permanent wounds or side effects that otherwise would cause a penalty to her reaction rolls are ignored.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Activating her glamour demands one turn (10 minutes) of concentration by the witch. Once activated, the glamour remains active until she ends it, is subject to a <strong>dispel</strong> effect, or is incapacitated. While the glamour is active, the witch radiates magic.</p>\n<p><strong>Decadent Arts (3rd level):</strong> The chthonic witch is a practiced seductress. She gains the Seduction proficiency. (If she already has Seduction, she can select Diplomacy or Intimidation instead.)</p>\n<p><strong>Subtle Beguilement (5th level):</strong> With subtle words of praise and disdain, the chthonic witch can beguile the weak-willed. When casting enchantment spells, the witch counts as having the Quiet Magic proficiency. If she already has Quiet Magic proficiency, she can cast enchantment spells using subvocalized words and no hand gestures. In either case, targets of her enchantment spells suffer a -2 penalty to their saving throw, or a -3 penalty if she also has Mastery of Enchantment &amp; Illusions proficiency.</p>\n<p><strong>Evil Eye (7th level):</strong> The chthonic witch can hex a foe with the merest glance. She can <em>bestow curse</em> as a spell-like ability once per week. Because her Evil Eye is a spell-like ability and not a spell, she does not need to declare she is casting it before initiative, nor does taking damage or failing a saving throw prior to her initiative segment prevent her from using it.</p>\n<p>Sylvan Witch</p>\n<p><strong>Friend of Birds and Beasts (1st level):</strong> From long years in the company of wild and fey things, the sylvan witch has gained the friendship of birds and beasts. She can identify plants and fauna with a proficiency throw of 11+. She can understand the vocalizations and body language of birds and beasts, enabling her to understand any simple messages the animals might be communicating (such as “danger is nearby, be alert,” “you’re unfamiliar and strange,” or “do not come closer, we are guarding our den!”). Because of her innate understanding of the language of beasts, the witch also counts as proficient for purposes of handling trained animals in their roles such as droving or shepherding. She gains +2 to all reaction rolls when encountering normal animals and can take animals as henchmen. She can train and handle animal henchmen to perform tricks or serve a particular role without having to separately possess Animal Training. If the witch also has the Beast Friendship proficiency, she can identify plants and fauna with a throw of 7+ and can take one more henchman than her Charisma would otherwise permit, as long as at least one is an animal. (The bonus to reaction rolls does not increase.)</p>\n<p><strong>Natural Arts (3rd level)</strong>: The sylvan witch knows the secrets of the woodlands. She gains the Naturalism proficiency. (If she already has Naturalism, she can take a second rank or select Alchemy or Healing instead.)</p>\n<p><strong>Close Friend of Birds and Beasts (5th level):</strong> The sylvan witch’s friendship with birds and beasts improves. She can <em>speak with beasts</em> (as the spell) at will. If she ever rolls Friendly reactions while speaking with small, cute animals such as songbirds, squirrels, and rabbits, the animals act as if <em>bewitched</em> in her presence.</p>\n<p><strong>Enchanted Forest (7th level)</strong>: The woodland home of a sylvan witch becomes a strange and magical place. She gains the power to cast <em>forest enchantment</em>(as the spell) once per week. Each use takes 1 turn (10 minutes). The sylvan witch can sustain a number of <em>forest enchantments</em> equal to her caster level, enabling her to enchant a vast swathe of territory (approximately 2 acres per level).</p>\n"

      "html": "<p>When a young woman first undertakes the study of witchcraft, she often believes she has discovered a path to freedom and power denied to others of her age and sex. And this is true – at first. A young witch only needs to interact with weak and enfeebled spiritual entities in order to cast her spells, and these beings she can dominate through sheer charisma and will. But as she begins to learn and cast more powerful spells, the witch must interact with increasingly powerful and ancient powers. These beings cannot be cajoled or coerced; they must be bargained with. Over time, the witch accumulates an increasing number of <strong>obligations</strong> to these beings, obligations that restrict her behavior as much as any priestess’s strictures.</p>\n<p>A witch starts with one simple obligationat 1st level and gains an additional obligation each time she gains the ability to cast another level of spells. The obligations become increasingly severe at higher levels, with the exact nature of the obligations determined by the Judge based on the witch’s alignment, tradition, and spell repertoire. The following obligations would be suitable for an antiquarian witch of Lawful or Neutral alignment:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>1st level: The witch must light a candle and pray over it for one turn (10 minutes) at noon and midnight.</li>\n<li>3rd level: The witch cannot lie. She can equivocate, prevaricate, speak in riddles, or stay silent, however.</li>\n<li>5th level: If the witch unjustly wrongs another human or demi-human, she must redress the wrong at threefold its value.</li>\n<li>7th level: If the witch accepts a gift, she must offer a gift of threefold value to the gift giver.</li>\n<li>9th level: If the witch suffers a personal wrong, she must exact retribution of threefold value from the one who wronged her.</li>\n<li>11th level: The witch’s soul is sworn to service after death. She cannot be restored to life by any means short of a <em>wish</em> or <em>miracle</em>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If a witch fails to uphold her obligations, the powers she is obligated to will certainly extract punishment. These penalties are entirely up to the Judge and might include curses, reductions in spells available, or even loss of some or all class powers entirely. To remove the penalties, the witch will have to atone for her violation by, e.g., sacrificing treasure, undertaking quests, or even receiving an <strong>atonement</strong> spell from a powerful caster of her order (Judge’s discretion).</p>\n"

  "rawMarkdown": "## Campaign Classes\n\n### Assassin\n\nKey Attribute: STR and DEX\n\nRequirements: None\n\nHit Dice: 1d6\n\nMaximum Level: 14\n\nAssassins are humans who train to kill by ambush and treachery. Assassins might be back-alley brawlers, violent thugs, or members of an organized guild. Within the Auran Empire, some assassins are members of the Order of the Eclipse, a religious brotherhood of trained killers, but others are simply murders-for-hire or rogues with a taste for violence.\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Assassin Level Progression** | | | |  |  |  |  |\n| **Experience** | **Title** | **Level** | **Hit**  **Dice** | **Damage**  **Bonus** | **Backstab** | **Hiding** | **Sneaking** |\n| 0 | Thug | 1 | 1d6 | +1 | +1d | 19+ | 17+ |\n| 1,750 | Enforcer | 2 | 2d6 | +1 | +1d | 18+ | 16+ |\n| 3,500 | Torturer | 3 | 3d6 | +2 | +1d | 17+ | 15+ |\n| 7,000 | Slayer | 4 | 4d6 | +2 | +1d | 16+ | 14+ |\n| 14,000 | Destroyer | 5 | 5d6 | +2 | +2d | 15+ | 13+ |\n| 28,000 | Executioner | 6 | 6d6 | +3 | +2d | 14+ | 12+ |\n| 55,000 | Blackguard | 7 | 7d6 | +3 | +2d | 12+ | 10+ |\n| 110,000 | Assassin | 8 | 8d6 | +3 | +2d | 10+ | 8+ |\n| 230,000 | Master Assassin | 9 | 9d6 | +4 | +3d | 8+ | 6+ |\n| 350,000 | Master Assassin, 10th level | 10 | 9d6 + 2\\* | +4 | +3d | 6+ | 4+ |\n| 470,000 | Master Assassin, 11th level | 11 | 9d6 + 4\\* | +4 | +3d | 4+ | 2+ |\n| 590,000 | Master Assassin, 12th level | 12 | 9d6 + 6\\* | +5 | +3d | 2+ | 0+ |\n| 710,000 | Master Assassin, 13th level | 13 | 9d6 + 8\\* | +5 | +4d | 0+ | -2+ |\n| 830,000 | Grandfather of Assassins | 14 | 9d6 + 10\\* | +5 | +4d | -2+ | -4+ |\n| \\*No adjustment from Constitution applies to this flat bonus. | | | | | | | |\n\n###### Combat Characteristics\n\nThough lacking somewhat in toughness, assassins are expert combatants with broad training in arms and armor. Although assassins generally prefer fast, concealable, or quiet weapons, killing can occur under many circumstances. And though they favor stealth over steel for protection, sometimes their work requires them to infiltrate or impersonate bodies of troops.\n\n**Combat Proficiencies:** Assassins have weapon proficiency with all weapons. They have armor proficiency with medium, light, and very light armor. They have fighting style proficiency with all three optional styles (i.e. the dual weapon, two-handed weapon, and weaponand shield styles).\n\n**Combat Progression:** Assassins advance in attack throws and saving throws as fighters, by two points every threelevels of experience. Assassins increase their base damage roll from successful missile and melee attacks by +1 at 1st level and by an additional +1 at 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th level. They can cleave after killing a foe a maximum of once per round per class level.\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Assassin (Fighter) Attack and Saving Throws** | | | | | |  |\n| **Level** | **Paralysis** | **Death** | **Blast** | **Implements** | **Spells** | **Attack Throw** |\n| 1 | 13+ | 14+ | 15+ | 16+ | 17+ | 10+ |\n| 2 – 3 | 12+ | 13+ | 14+ | 15+ | 16+ | 9+ |\n| 4 | 11+ | 12+ | 13+ | 14+ | 15+ | 8+ |\n| 5 – 6 | 10+ | 11+ | 12+ | 13+ | 14+ | 7+ |\n| 7 | 9+ | 10+ | 11+ | 12+ | 13+ | 6+ |\n| 8-9 | 8+ | 9+ | 10+ | 11+ | 12+ | 5+ |\n| 10 | 7+ | 8+ | 9+ | 10+ | 11+ | 4+ |\n| 11 – 12 | 6+ | 7+ | 8+ | 9+ | 10+ | 3+ |\n| 13 | 5+ | 6+ | 7+ | 8+ | 9+ | 2+ |\n| 14 | 4+ | 5+ | 6+ | 7+ | 8+ | 1+ |\n\n###### Starting Class Powers\n\nAt the start of play, assassins have the class powers below. As with thieves, most of the assassin’s skills improve as the assassin gains levels according to the progression on the Assassin Level Progression table. While assassins can wear medium armor, they cannot use their backstabbing, hiding, or sneaking powers unless wearing light armor or less.\n\n**Backstabbing**: Assassins are skilled at treacherously attacking unprepared enemies. An assassin can backstab any **vulnerable** opponent. Backstabs can be made in melee or with missile weapons at short range, but cannot be made with missile weapons at medium or longer range. When backstabbing, an assassin gains a +4 bonus to hit and if the attack succeeds, the assassin deals an additional die of damage at 1st level, and another additional die at 5th, 9th, and 13th level.\n\n**Hiding:** Assassins are trained to skulk unseen in the cover of darkness. An assassin can begin hiding as a combat action anytime he is in cover, dim light, or darkness. When the assassin begins hiding, the Judge must make a Hiding proficiency throw on behalf of the assassin. An assassin will always think he is successful in this skill, and will not know otherwise until others react to his presence. Regardless of whether the throw succeeds, opponents encountering the assassin suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls as long as he remains stationary in cover, dim light, or darkness.\n\nIf the throw succeeds, the assassin is **hidden**. If the throw fails, the assassin is not hidden. No creature can claim line of sight on an assassin that is hidden from it. If a hidden assassin engages an unengaged opponent, the opponent cannot make a free facing change (p. XX). If an opponent knows the hidden assassin’s general location, the opponent can attack him in melee at a -4 penalty, but it cannot even blindly attack the assassin if it doesn’t knows his general location. The hidden condition expires at the end of the assassin’s initiative if he moves or attacks. It also terminates if the cover, dim light, or darkness no longer conceals the assassin from his opponents.\n\n**Shadowy Senses:** Since the bright light of torches will reveal their positions, assassins learn to rely on superior night-vision, keen hearing and smell, and echolocation to slowly scout through dark alleys, lightless dungeons, and star-lit rooftops. When moving at combat speed or exploration speed, an assassin can “see” as if he were carrying a light source that sheds dim light in a 30’ radius. Shadowy senses can be used to fight, probe for traps, and so on. However, shadowy senses cannot be used to discern colors, faces, markings, or flat images (such as frescoes and murals) or to read books, maps, or scrolls. Shadowy senses does not function if the assassin is charging or running, if deafened, or if in an area of magical darkness or magical silence. Because it counts as dim light, an opponent can hide from shadowy senses.\n\n**Sneaking:** Assassins learn to prowl with great stealth. An assassin can begin sneaking as a movement action. He can sneak at his encounter speed or one-half combat speed without penalty. If he moves greater than half his combat speed, he takes a -5 penalty to the Sneaking proficiency throw. If he runs, he takes a -10 penalty.\n\nWhen the assassin begins sneaking, the Judge must make a Sneaking proficiency throw on behalf of the assassin. An assassin will always think he is successful in this skill, and will not know otherwise until others react to his presence. Regardless of whether the throw succeeds, opponents encountering the assassin suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls if the assassin is outside their line of sight.\n\nIf the throw succeeds, the assassin is also **sneaking**. If the throw fails, the assassin is not sneaking. When sneaking, the assassin makes no noise when he moves — none whatsoever. Even alert creatures that make a successful Listening proficiency throw will not hear a sound. When a sneaking assassin engages an unengaged opponent from the rear, the opponent cannot make a free facing change.\n\n**Streetwise:** The assassin has learned the hard lessons taught by life as a criminal. He might begin play as a member of an assassin’s guild or other criminal syndicate (Judge’s discretion). He can engage in hijinks if he has the necessary proficiencies or thief skills. He can automatically identify gestures, signs, slang, and territory of criminal organizations in his home settlement. He can identify those of other urban settlements with a proficiency throw of 11+. Secret organizations or organizations in far-off cities might be harder to recognize. (This class power is equivalent to one rank of Streetwise proficiency.)\n\n###### Additional Class Powers\n\nWhen they advance in level, assassins gain the following additional class powers:\n\n**Hideout (9th level):** By acquiring a **hideout** worth at least 5,000gp, the assassin can attract followers to his service. 2d6 1st level assassins will arrive to serve him as followers within 1d4 weeks of him acquiring the hideout. If the assassin already has a hideout, the followers arrive to serve him within 1d4 weeks of him reaching 9th level. If hired, the followers must be paid standard rates for henchmen. These followers will serve the character with some loyalty, though at least one will be an infiltrator working for the assassin’s local rivals, sent to keep an eye on the character. A cunning and resourceful assassin can use these followers to start a criminal syndicate. Additional rules for hideouts and syndicates are detailed in the **Campaigns** chapter.\n\n###### Class Proficiencies\n\n**Proficiency Progression:** At 1st level, assassins select one class proficiency from their class proficiency list and one general proficiency from the general proficiency list.

Some barbarians live on the edge of true savagery, while others hail from rich cultures with epic poetry and weapons of steel, but all share an outlander’s mix of contempt and awe for the grand tapestry of civilization. In the Auran Empire, barbarians might be reavers from the bleak wastes of northern Jutland, fierce horse archers from Skysostan, or tribesmen from the Ivory Kingdom jungles of Keita, Munde, and Kushtu.\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Barbarian Level Progression** | | | | |\n| **Experience** | **Title** | **Level** | **Hit Dice** | **Damage Bonus** |\n| 0 | Hunter | 1 | 1d8 | +1 |\n| 2,250 | Raider | 2 | 2d8 | +1 |\n| 4,500 | Marauder | 3 | 3d8 | +2 |\n| 9,000 | Plunderer | 4 | 4d8 | +2 |\n| 18,000 | Reaver | 5 | 5d8 | +2 |\n| 36,000 | Bloodletter | 6 | 6d8 | +3 |\n| 70,000 | Menace | 7 | 7d8 | +3 |\n| 140,000 | Scourge | 8 | 8d8 | +3 |\n| 260,000 | Warchief | 9 | 9d8 | +4 |\n| 380,000 | Warchief, 10th lvl | 10 | 9d8 + 2\\* | +4 |\n| 500,000 | Warchief , 11th lvl | 11 | 9d8 + 4\\* | +4 |\n| 620,000 | Warchief , 12th lvl | 12 | 9d8 + 6\\* | +5 |\n| 740,000 | Warchief , 13th lvl | 13 | 9d8 + 8\\* | +5 |\n| 860,000 | Great Chieftain | 14 | 9d8 + 10\\* | +5 |\n| \\*No adjustment from Constitution applies to this flat bonus. | | | | |\n\n###### Combat Characteristics\n\nBarbarians are fierce and deadly combatants feared throughout the civilized world. Though they lack the broad professional training of the fighter, they more than compensate with their animal reflexes and savage fury.\n\n**Combat Proficiencies:** Barbarians are limited to a range of weapon, armor, and fighting style proficiencies that are traditional to their people, as shown on the Barbarian Combat Proficiencies table below.\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Region** | **Armor Proficiencies** | **Weapon Proficiencies** | **Fighting Style Proficiencies** |\n| Jutland | Medium  Light  Very Light | Battle axe, dagger, great axe, hand axe, javelin, short bow, spear, sword, two-handed sword, warhammer | Weapon and shield  Two-handed weapon |\n| Skysostan | Medium  Light  Very Light | Composite bow, dagger, hand axe, javelin, lance, short bow, short sword (scimitar), sling, spear, whip | Dual weapon  Weapon and shield |\n| Ivory Kingdoms | Medium  Light  Very Light | Bola, club, dart, dagger, hand axe, javelin, net, short bow, short sword, spear | Dual weapon  Weapon and shield |\n\n**Combat Progression:** Barbarians advance in attack throws and saving throws by two points every three levels of experience (i.e. the same progression as fighters). They increase their base damage roll from their choice of either missile or melee attacks by +1 at 1st level and by an additional +1 at 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th level. The barbarian must choose which type of attack will receive the damage bonus at 1st level, and cannot change the choice as he advances (i.e. they can choose to be either melee or missile specialists). They can cleave after killing a foe a maximum of once per round per class level.\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Barbarian (Fighter) Attack and Saving Throws** | | | | | |  |\n| **Level** | **Paralysis** | **Death** | **Blast** | **Implements** | **Spells** | **Attack Throw** |\n| 1 | 13+ | 14+ | 15+ | 16+ | 17+ | 10+ |\n| 2 – 3 | 12+ | 13+ | 14+ | 15+ | 16+ | 9+ |\n| 4 | 11+ | 12+ | 13+ | 14+ | 15+ | 8+ |\n| 5 – 6 | 10+ | 11+ | 12+ | 13+ | 14+ | 7+ |\n| 7 | 9+ | 10+ | 11+ | 12+ | 13+ | 6+ |\n| 8 – 9 | 8+ | 9+ | 10+ | 11+ | 12+ | 5+ |\n| 10 | 7+ | 8+ | 9+ | 10+ | 11+ | 4+ |\n| 11 – 12 | 6+ | 7+ | 8+ | 9+ | 10+ | 3+ |\n| 13 | 5+ | 6+ | 7+ | 8+ | 9+ | 2+ |\n| 14 | 4+ | 5+ | 6+ | 7+ | 8+ | 1+ |\n\n###### Starting Class Powers\n\nAt the start of play, barbarians have the following class powers.\n\n**Animal Reflexes:** Barbarians react to danger as fast as a deer to a wolf. A barbarian gains a +1 bonus to initiative and a +1 bonus to avoid surprise.\n\n**Natural Proficiency:** Depending on his region of origin, every barbarian possesses natural proficiencies in a particular area. These are bonus proficiencies that do not count against the barbarian’s normal selections.\n\n* Barbarians from Jutland gain Climbing and Seafaring proficiencies.\n* Barbarians from Skysostan gain Precise Shooting and Riding proficiencies.\n* Barbarians from the Ivory Kingdoms gain Running and Endurance proficiencies.\n\nThe Judge might devise other natural proficiencies for other barbarian regions in his own setting.\n\n**Natural Stealth:** As hunters and raiders by trade, barbarians are naturally sneaky. Opponents suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls when encountering a barbarian approaching from outside line of sight or lying in wait in cover or darkness.\n\n**Savage Resilience:** The healers and priests of civilized lands are foreign to barbarians, who rely on their **savage resilience** to survive. When a barbarian is required to consult the Mortal Woundstable, the player can roll twice and choose the preferred result to apply. Barbarians also subtract their class level from the number of days of bed rest required to recover.\n\nEXAMPLE: Sigwulf, a 4th level Barbarian with 16 CON and 24 hp, is reduced to -7 hp. When a friend treats his wounds, Sigwulf rolls on the Mortal Wounds table. He rolls 1d20 and 1d6 twice, and scores a modified 17/2 and an 11/6. An 11/6 results in the loss of 1d6 teeth, while 17/2 results in loss of genitals; the players opts for the 11/6 result and consigns 1d6 of Sigwulf’s teeth to oblivion. Although normally 1 week’s bed rest is required to recover from a result of 11 (critically wounded), this is reduced to just 3 days because of Sigwulf’s class level.\n\n###### Additional Class Powers\n\nWhen they advance in level, barbarians gain the following additional class powers:\n\n**Animal Magnetism (5th level)**: The barbarian has become a formidable presence who inspires those who follow him. Any henchmen and mercenaries hired by the barbarian gain a +1 bonus to their morale score whenever he personally leads them. This bonus stacks with any modifiers from the barbarian’s Charisma or proficiencies.\n\n**Chieftain’s Hall (9th level):** By acquiring a **chieftain’s hall** worth at least 15,000gp, the barbarian can attract followers to his service. 5d6 x 10 0th level troops and 1d6 barbarians of 1st – 3rd level arrive to serve him within 1d3 months of him acquiring the chieftain’s hall. If the barbarian already has a chieftain’s hall, the followers arrive to serve him within 1d3 months of him reaching 9th level. The barbarian must pay his followers the ordinary rates for mercenaries and henchmen or they leave his service. Additional rules for chieftain’s halls are detailed in the **Campaigns** chapter.\n\n###### Class Proficiencies\n\n**Proficiency Progression:** At 1st level, barbarians select one class proficiency from their class proficiency list and one general proficiency from the general proficiency list. They select an additional class proficiency at 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th level. They select an additional general proficiency at 5th, 9th, and 13th level.\n\n**Barbarian Proficiency List:** Alertness, Ambushing, Armor Training, Beast Friendship, Berserkergang, Blind Fighting, Climbing, Combat Ferocity, Combat Reflexes, Combat Trickery (force back, knock down, overrun, wrestling), Command, Fighting Style Specialization, Martial Training, Mountaineering, Mounted Combat, Passing Without Trace, Precise Shooting, Riding, Running, Seafaring, Skirmishing, Sniping, Swashbuckling, Weapon Finesse, Weapon Focus\n\n###### Barbarian Templates\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **3d6**  **Roll** | **Template** | **Proficiencies** | **Starting Equipment** |\n| 3 – 4 | Tribal Warrior  (Ivory Kingdoms) | Ambushing  Tracking  **Running**  **Endurance** | Bola, 5 feathered darts, spear decorated with beads and feathers, club, cowhide shield, wildebeest hide armor, loincloth, sandals, hide belt, hide pouch, 2 small hide sacks, waterskin, 1 week’s iron rations, 65sp (enc. 5 st) |\n| 5 – 6 | Berserker  (Jutland) | Berserkergang  Intimidation  **Climbing**  **Seafaring** | Long bearded axe, chain mail armor, rough spun wool tunic and pants, embossed belt, low fur-lined boots, backpack, waterskin, 1 week’s iron rations, 4gp (enc. 6 2/6 st) |\n| 7 – 8 | Sea Rover  (Jutland) | Swashbuckling  Navigation  **Climbing**  **Seafaring** | Short bow, quiver with 20 arrows, iron-tipped spear, bearded axe, kite shield painted with a dragon, leather armor, rough spun wool tunic and pants, embossed belt, low boots, small sack, 50’ rope, grappling hook, waterskin, 1 week’s iron rations, 6gp (enc. 6 5/6 st) |\n| 9 – 10 | Skirmisher  (Skysostan) | Skirmishing  Endurance  **Precise Shooting**  **Riding** | Composite bow, bowquiver with 20 arrows, pair of scimitars, leather-backed scale armor, wool tunic and pants, embossed belt, low boots, backpack, waterskin, 1 week’s iron rations, 2gp (enc. 5 st) |\n| 11 – 12 | Death Dealer  (Jutland) | Combat Ferocity  Survival  **Climbing**  **Seafaring** | Two-handed iron sword, francisca, ring mail armor, wool tunic and pants, leather belt, low boots, silver arm-bands (20gp value), belt pouch, small sack, 50’ rope, grappling hook, waterskin, 1 week’s iron rations, 12gp (enc. 7 st) |\n| 13–14 | Pit Fighter  (Ivory Kingdoms) | Combat Reflexes  Gambling  **Running**  **Endurance** | Spear, weighted net, hand axe, heavy arena armor, plumed heavy helmet with visor and crest, armiger’s tunic and pants, strappy spiked belt, sandals, small sack, amphora of oil (for polishing body), 2 weeks’ iron rations, 34gp in arena winnings (enc. 9 st) |\n| 15 – 16 | Housecarl  (Jutland) | Fighting Style Specialization (weapon and shield)  Manual of Arms  **Climbing**  **Seafaring** | Short bow, quiver with 20 arrows, iron spear, iron sword, kite shield painted with house crest, chain mail armor, wool tunic and pants, silver arm-bands (20gp value), silver amulet (50gp value), embossed belt, low boots, backpack, 50’ rope, grappling hook, waterskin, 1 week’s meaty iron rations, 11gp (enc. 9 2/6 st) |\n| 17 – 18 | Nomad  (Skysostan) | Mounted Combat  Survival  **Precise Shooting**  **Riding** | Composite bow, bowquiver with 20 arrows, scimitar, leather-backed scale armor, wool tunic and pants, riding boots, steppe riding horse, riding saddle and tack, leather saddlebag, 1 week’s iron rations, 6gp (enc. 3 4/6 st with rations on horse) |\n\n**Notes:** The region from which each template hails is noted in parentheses in the Template column.

The sea rover’s bearded axe is a type of battle axe. The death dealer’s francisca is a type of hand axe.\n\n### Bard\n\nKey Attribute: DEX and CHA\n\nRequirements: None\n\nHit Dice: 1d4\n\nMaximum Level: 14\n\nSuccessful adventurers live forever in the sagas and songs about their deeds. Remembering and recounting these sagas is the profession of bards. Most bards are content to recite the deeds of others, but some bold few participate in the dangers themselves and become inspiring heroes in their own right. In the Auran Empire, such a bard might be an adventuring minstrel with a sword in his hand and a song at his lips, a warrior-skald of the Jutland kingdoms, or a haughty Kemeshi aristocrat.\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Bard Level Progression** | | | | | | | | |\n| **Experience** | **Title** | | **Level** | **Hit**  **Dice** | **Damage**  **Bonus** | **Arcane Dabbling** | **Listening** | **Loremastery** |\n| 0 | Reciter | | 1 | 1d4 | +1 | 4+ | 14+ | 18+ |\n| 1,750 | Versifier | | 2 | 2d4 | +1 | 4+ | 13+ | 17+ |\n| 3,500 | Archivist | | 3 | 3d4 | +2 | 4+ | 12+ | 16+ |\n| 7,000 | Annalist | | 4 | 4d4 | +2 | 4+ | 11+ | 15+ |\n| 14,000 | Chronicler | | 5 | 5d4 | +2 | 4+ | 10+ | 14+ |\n| 28,000 | Panegyrist | | 6 | 6d4 | +3 | 4+ | 9+ | 13+ |\n| 56,000 | Skald | | 7 | 7d4 | +3 | 4+ | 8+ | 12+ |\n| 110,000 | Rhapsodist | | 8 | 8d4 | +3 | 4+ | 7+ | 11+ |\n| 220,000 | Bard | | 9 | 9d4 | +4 | 4+ | 6+ | 10+ |\n| 320,000 | Bard, 10th level | | 10 | 9d4 + 2\\* | +4 | 4+ | 5+ | 9+ |\n| 420,000 | Bard, 11th level | | 11 | 9d4 + 4\\* | +4 | 4+ | 4+ | 8+ |\n| 520,000 | Bard, 12th level | | 12 | 9d4 + 6\\* | +5 | 4+ | 3+ | 7+ |\n| 620,000 | Bard, 13th level | | 13 | 9d4 + 8\\* | +5 | 4+ | 2+ | 6+ |\n| 720,000 | Master Bard | | 14 | 9d4 + 10\\* | +5 | 4+ | 1+ | 5+ |\n|  | | \\*No adjustment from Constitution applies to this flat bonus. | | | | | | |\n\n###### Combat Characteristics\n\n**Combat Proficiencies:** Bards have weapon proficiency with all missile weapons and with all tiny, small, and medium melee weapons. They have armor proficiency with medium, light, and very light armor. They have fighting style proficiency with all three optional styles (i.e. the dual weapon, two-handed weapon, and weaponand shield styles).\n\n**Combat Progression:** Bards advance in attack throws and saving throws by two points every three levels of experience. They increase their base damage roll from successful missile and melee attacks by +1 at 1st level, and by an additional +1 at 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th level. They can cleave after killing a foe a maximum of once per round per class level.\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Bard (Fighter) Attack and Saving Throws** | | | | | |  |\n| **Level** | **Paralysis** | **Death** | **Blast** | **Implements** | **Spells** | **Attack Throw** |\n| 1 | 13+ | 14+ | 15+ | 16+ | 17+ | 10+ |\n| 2 – 3 | 12+ | 13+ | 14+ | 15+ | 16+ | 9+ |\n| 4 | 11+ | 12+ | 13+ | 14+ | 15+ | 8+ |\n| 5 – 6 | 10+ | 11+ | 12+ | 13+ | 14+ | 7+ |\n| 7 | 9+ | 10+ | 11+ | 12+ | 13+ | 6+ |\n| 8 – 9 | 8+ | 9+ | 10+ | 11+ | 12+ | 5+ |\n| 10 | 7+ | 8+ | 9+ | 10+ | 11+ | 4+ |\n| 11 – 12 | 6+ | 7+ | 8+ | 9+ | 10+ | 3+ |\n| 13 | 5+ | 6+ | 7+ | 8+ | 9+ | 2+ |\n| 14 | 4+ | 5+ | 6+ | 7+ | 8+ | 1+ |\n\n###### Starting Class Powers\n\nAt the start of play, bards have the following class powers. As with thieves, some of the bard’s throws improve as he gains levels according to the progression shown on the Bard Level Progression table.\n\n**Arcane Dabbling:** Bards are prone to dabble in the arcane. They can attempt to use wands, staffs, and other magic items only usable by arcane casters. The bard does not need to know the command word for the item, but he must make a proficiency throw of 4+ on 1d20 or the attempt backfires in some desultory way (Judge’s discretion).\n\n**Inspire Courage:** By reciting heroic lays and epic poems, bards can improve the effectiveness of their allies. Inspiring courage requires a few moments of oration before a battle (one round), and makes up to 30 of the bard’s allies within a 50’ radius **inspired**. An inspired creature gains a +1 bonus to attack throws, armor class, morale rolls (for monsters or NPCs allied with the caster), and saving throws against magical **fear**. The bonus lasts for 10 minutes (1 turn). A bard can inspire courage once per day per class level. (Even the most inspired epic gets stale if you hear it twice in the same day.) A bard cannot inspire courage on characters who are already **engaged** in combat.\n\n**Jack of All Trades:** Being habitually curious jacks-of-all-trades, bards pick up an array of skills that vary widely. The bard can learn a class proficiency from any class; a thief skill (excluding backstab); a venturer class power (excluding mercantile network); or other class power approved by the Judge, excluding spellcasting powers. The bard cannot select a class power when the bard’s class level is lower than the class level at which that power becomes available to its default class. For instance, he could not select Rumormongering at 1st level because it doesn’t become available to venturers until 4th level. Note that some selections might not be useful; e.g. the bard has no spells to regain with Contemplation, so that proficiency isn’t ever a good choice.\n\n**Listening:** Bards have sharp ears that permit them to hear noises in caves, hallways, at a door, or other locations. The Judge makes a Listening proficiency throw in secret on behalf of the bard. If the throw succeeds, he hears any noises in earshot. If the throw fails, or if there aren’t any noises in earshot, he doesn’t hear anything. The bard must be quiet and must be the closest creature in the party relative to the location of the sound or suspected sound. Listening only requires one round but can only be undertaken once per turn (10 minutes) if the party is moving at all, because it takes time for people to settle down into quiet.\n\n**Loremastery:** The bard can make a proficiency throw of 18+ to decipher occult runes, remember ancient history, or identify a historic artifact or special monster part. The proficiency throw required reduces by 1 per level. He can also identify magic items as if he were a 5th level mage. (This class power is the equivalent of Loremastery proficiency.)\n\n**Multilingual:** Because they travel widely and converse freely, bards become conversant in a wide variety of tongues. They gain three bonus languages. The bard can select some or all of these languages immediately from among those in common use in the campaign’s starting region or select them later from among those he encounters in play. (This class power is the equivalent of one rank of Language proficiency.)\n\n**Performance:** The bard has been trained in a performing art such as chanting, reciting poetry, singing, or playing an instrument. He can earn 10gp per month from working as a street performer or tavern entertainer. He can identify renowned performers, famous works, and unusual songs with a proficiency throw of 11+. (This class power is equivalent to one rank of Performance proficiency.)\n\n###### Additional Class Powers\n\n**Jack of All Trades II (3rd level):** The bard can learn another class proficiency from any class, thief skill (excluding backstab), venturer class power (excluding mercantile network), or other class power approved by the Judge, excluding spellcasting.\n\n**Deciphering (4th level****):** The bard gains the ability to decipher text(including ciphers, treasure maps, and dead languages, but not magical writings). Deciphering a page of text requires one turn (10 minutes) and a successful proficiency throw of 4+ on 1d20. If the roll does not succeed, the bard cannot try to decipher that particular page of text until he reaches a higher level of experience.\n\n**Chronicles of Battle (5th):** The bard’s songs and stories inspire his hirelings to strive for glory. Any henchmen and mercenaries hired by the bard gain a +1 bonus to their morale score while the bard is present to witness and record their deeds. This bonus stacks with any modifiers from the bard’s Charisma or proficiencies.\n\n**Jack of All Trades III (6th level):** The bard can learn another class proficiency from any class, thief skill (excluding backstab), venturer class power (excluding mercantile network), or other class power approved by the Judge, excluding spellcasting.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Max HP | Temp HP Gained |\n| 1 – 3 | 1d2 |\n| 4 – 9 | 1d3 |\n| 10 – 16 | 1d4 |\n| 17 – 23 | 1d6 |\n| 24 – 29 | 1d8 |\n| 30 – 36 | 1d10 |\n| 37 – 49 | 2d6 |\n| 50 – 63 | 2d8 |\n| 64 – 76 | 2d10 |\n| 77 – 89 | 2d12 |\n| 90 – 110 | 3d10 |\n| 111 – 140 | 4d10 |\n| 141 – 170 | 5d10 |\n| 171+ | 6d10, plus 1d10  per 30 hp past 170 |\n\n**Inspire Hope (7th):** By recounting the glorious deeds of old, bards can brighten the darkest moment. Inspiring hope requires a few moments of oration (one round), and grants up to 30 of the bard’s allies within 30’ a pool of temporary hit points. The number of hit points gained by each ally is determined on the adjoining table based on the bard’s or the ally’s max hit points (whichever is lower). These temporary hit points last for one turn (10 minutes), until lost to damage, or until the bard inspires hope on the ally again, whichever comes first. The bard can inspire hope once per day at 7th level, and one additional time per day with each level thereafter.\n\n**Jack of All Trades IV (8th level):** The bard can learn another class proficiency from any class, thief skill (excluding backstab), venturer class power (excluding mercantile network), or other class power approved by the Judge, excluding spellcasting.\n\n**Great Hall (9th level):** By acquiring a **great hall** worth at least 15,000gp, the bard can attract followers to his service. 5d6 x 10 0th level troops and 1d6 bards of 1st – 3rd level arrive to serve him within 1d3 months of him acquiring the hall. If the bard already has a hall, the followers arrive to serve him within 1d3 months of him reaching 9th level. The bard must pay his followers the ordinary rates for mercenaries and henchmen or they leave his service. Additional rules for great halls are detailed in the **Campaigns** chapter.\n\n**Scrollreading (10th):** The bard gains the ability to read and cast magic from arcane and divine scrolls. The bard does not have to be able to read the language in which the scroll is written provided he has successfully deciphered it before. Reading a magical scroll requires one round and a successful proficiency throw of 4+ on 1d20. However, a failed throw means the spell does not function as expected, and can create a horrible effect at the Judge’s discretion.\n\n**Jack of All Trades V (11th level):** The bard can learn another class proficiency from any class, thief skill (excluding backstab), venturer class power (excluding mercantile network), or other class power approved by the Judge, excluding spellcasting.\n\n###### Class Proficiencies\n\n**Proficiency Progression:** At 1st level, bards select one class proficiency from their class proficiency list and one general proficiency from the general proficiency list. They select an additional class proficiency at 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th level.

They belong to military clerical orders, where they are trained in fighting and casting spells. Within the Auran Empire, most bladedancers are trained to the art from a young age in the Temples of Ianna, Goddess of Love and War. A fully trained bladedancer is highly coveted as a bodyguard and escort by the great noble houses.\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Bladedancer Level Progression** | | | | **Bladedancer Spell Progression** | | | | | | | |\n| **Experience** | **Title** | **Level** | **Hit Dice** | **AC Bonus** |  | **1** | **2** | **3** | **4** | **5** | **6** |\n| 0 | Blade-Initiate | 1 | 1d6 | +1 |  | 1 | - | - | - | - | - |\n| 1,500 | Blade-Daughter | 2 | 2d6 | +1 |  | 2 | - | - | - | - | - |\n| 3,000 | Blade-Singer | 3 | 3d6 | +1 |  | 2 | 1 | - | - | - | - |\n| 6,000 | Blade-Weaver | 4 | 4d6 | +1 |  | 2 | 2 | - | - | - | - |\n| 12,000 | Blade-Sister | 5 | 5d6 | +1 |  | 2 | 2 | 1 | - | - | - |\n| 24,000 | Blade-Adept | 6 | 6d6 | +1 |  | 2 | 2 | 2 | - | - | - |\n| 50,000 | Blade-Dancer | 7 | 7d6 | +2 |  | 3 | 2 | 2 | 1 | - | - |\n| 100,000 | Blade-Priestess | 8 | 8d6 | +2 |  | 3 | 3 | 2 | 2 | - | - |\n| 200,000 | Blade-Mistress | 9 | 9d6 | +2 |  | 3 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 1 | - |\n| 300,000 | Blade-Mistress, 10th level | 10 | 9d6 + 1\\* | +2 |  | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 2 | - |\n| 400,000 | Blade-Mistress, 11th level | 11 | 9d6 + 2\\* | +2 |  | 4 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 1 |\n| 500,000 | Blade-Mistress, 12th level | 12 | 9d6 + 3\\* | +2 |  | 4 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 2 |\n| 600,000 | Blade-Mistress, 13th level | 13 | 9d6 + 4\\* | +3 |  | 4 | 4 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 2 |\n| 700,000 | Mistress of All Blades | 14 | 9d6 + 5\\* | +3 |  | 4 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 3 | 3 |\n| \\*No adjustment from Constitution applies to this flat bonus. | | | | | | | | | | | |\n\n###### Combat Characteristics\n\nBladedancers are skilled combatants trained in the graceful fighting style that gives them their name.\n\n**Armor and Weapons:** Bladedancers have weapon proficiency with all swords (including daggers, short swords, swords, and two-handed swords) and all spears (including lances, javelins, polearms, and spears). They have armor proficiency with light and very light armor. They have fighting style proficiency with the dual weapon and two-handed weapon styles, but not with the weapon and shield style.\n\n**Combat Progression:** At first level, bladedancers hit an unarmored foe (AC 0) with an attack throw of 10+. They advance like crusaders in attack throws and saving throws, by two points every four levels of experience. They do not gain any bonus to damage as they advance in level. They can cleave after killing a foe a maximum of once per round per every two class levels (rounded down).\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Bladedancer (Crusader) Attack and Saving Throws** | | | | | |  |\n| **Level** | **Paralysis** | **Death** | **Blast** | **Implements** | **Spells** | **Attack Throw** |\n| 1 – 2 | 13+ | 10+ | 16+ | 13+ | 15+ | 10+ |\n| 3 – 4 | 12+ | 9+ | 15+ | 12+ | 14+ | 9+ |\n| 5 – 6 | 11+ | 8+ | 14+ | 11+ | 13+ | 8+ |\n| 7 – 8 | 10+ | 7+ | 13+ | 10+ | 12+ | 7+ |\n| 9 – 10 | 9+ | 6+ | 12+ | 9+ | 11+ | 6+ |\n| 11 – 12 | 8+ | 5+ | 11+ | 8+ | 10+ | 5+ |\n| 13 – 14+ | 7+ | 4+ | 10+ | 7+ | 9+ | 4+ |\n\n###### Starting Class Powers\n\nAt the start of play, bladedancers have the following class powers.\n\n**Graceful Fighting:** The bladedancer fights in an agile and acrobatic style that resembles a choreographed dance. If a bladedancer is wearing light armor, very light armor, or no armor, and carrying 5 stones or less encumbrance, she gains a +1 bonus to initiative and a +1 bonus to Armor Class. At 7th level, the AC bonus increases to +2, and at 13th level the AC bonus increases to +3.\n\nGraceful fighting can be stacked with Swashbuckling proficiency to increase the AC bonus, but the bonus from Swashbuckling is capped at +1 unless the bladedancer is unarmored.\n\n**Divine Magic:** Bladedancers can manifest their goddess’s power in the form of divine spells, which are granted through prayer and worship. The number and levels of spells the bladedancer can cast in a single day are listed on the Bladedancer Spell Progression table. The bladedancer’s spell selection is limited to the spells in her order’s **repertoire** (which is different than that of the crusader). See the **Spells** chapter for a list of all available spells.\n\n**Strength of Faith:** When the bladedancer strikes a foe, the goddess lends her strength to the blow. The bladedancer can apply her WIL modifier instead of her STR modifier on any damage roll affected by STR.\n\n**Theology:** Every bladedancer receives religious instruction at an abbey, cloister, or temple. She can begin play as a member of a religious hierarchy (Judge’s discretion). She can acquire congregants through proselytizing. She can automatically identify religious symbols, spell signatures, trappings, and holy days of her own faith, and can recognize those of other faiths with a proficiency throw of 11+. Rare or occult cults might be harder to recognize. (This class power is the equivalent of one rank of Theology proficiency.)\n\n**Weapon Finesse:** Bladedancers fight with lissome speed and cat-like agility. A bladedancer can apply her DEX modifier instead of her STR modifier on her melee attack throws when using weapons with which she is proficient. (This class power is the equivalent of Weapon Finesse proficiency, except that it applies to the bladedancer’s specific weapons rather than to all tiny, small, or medium weapons. It cannot stack with Weapon Finesse.)\n\n###### Additional Class Powers\n\nWhen they advance in level, bladedancers gain the following additional class powers:\n\n**Minor Magical Research (5th):** The bladedancer can scribe scrolls and brew potions.\n\n**Major Magical Research (9th):** The bladedancer can create permanent magic items such as enchanted armor, rings, or weapons.\n\n**Temple (9th level):** By acquiring a **temple** worth at least 15,000gp, the bladedancer can attract followers to her service. So long as the bladedancer is currently in favor with her goddess, she can buy or build her temple at half the normal price due to miraculous assistance. 5d6 x 10 0th level troops and 1d6 bladedancers of 1st level of the same religion arrive to serve her within 1d3 months of her acquiring the temple. If the bladedancer has already acquired a temple, the followers arrive to serve her within 1d3 months of her reaching 9th level. The followers are fanatically brave and completely loyal (loyalty +4 and morale +4). Despite their loyalty, the followers must be paid a fair wage or they might eventually leave the bladedancer’s service. Additional rules for temples are detailed in the **Campaigns** chapter.\n\n**Supreme Magical Research (11th level):** The bladedancer can learn and cast ritual divine spells of great power (7th, 8th, and 9th level) and craft magical constructs. If chaotic, the bladedancer can create necromantic servants and become undead. Rules for magic research can be found in the **Campaigns** chapter (p. XX).\n\n###### Code of Behavior\n\nLike crusaders, bladedancers must uphold the strictures of their order and their goddess. If the Judge has not specified particular religious orders in his campaign, the default bladedancer is assumed to be from the Temple of the Blade and Veil, the order devoted to Ianna, Goddess of Love and War. The strictures of their order are many.\n\n* The bladedancer must always carry a weapon on her person, except where imperial or sacred law forbids it.\n* The bladedancer must offer prayers to Ianna at either dawn or dusk. Offering prayers requires one hour (6 turns).\n* The bladedancer must not debase herself by fighting with the implements of the peasantry such as axes and hammers, by dishonorably firing bows or slings from a distance, or by resorting to shields for defense. (She can, however, hurl javelins or spears she carries.)\n* The bladedancer must not get married or have children before she reaches the rank of Blade-Dancer (7th level). She needn’t remain chaste, however, and may have liaisons as desired.\n* The bladedancer must not use her divine magic for unlawful or chaotic purposes.\n\nIf a bladedancer ever falls from favor, due to violating the strictures of her faith, the goddess can impose penalties upon the bladedancer. As with crusaders, these penalties are entirely up to the Judge.\n\n###### Class Proficiencies\n\n**Proficiency Progression:** At 1st level, bladedancers select one class proficiency from their class proficiency list and one general proficiency from the general proficiency list. They select an additional class proficiency at 4th, 8th, and 12th level. They select an additional general proficiency at 5th, 9th, and 13th level.\n\n**Bladedancer Proficiency List**: Acrobatics, Battle Magic, Beast Friendship, Combat Reflexes, Combat Trickery (disarm, knock down), Contemplation, Diplomacy, Divine Blessing, Divine Health, Elven Bloodline, Fighting Style Specialization, Laying on Hands, Magical Music, Martial Training, Mounted Combat, Mystic Aura, Prestidigitation, Prophecy, Quiet Magic, Running, Seduction, Skirmishing, Swashbuckling, Syncretism, Unarmed Fighting, Unflappable Casting, Weapon Focus\n\n###### Bladedancer Templates\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **3d6 Roll** | **Template** | **Proficiencies** | **Starting Equipment** |\n| 3 – 4 | Warrior Witch | Syncretism  Alchemy | Holy symbol (lion of Ianna), wickedly curved short sword, animal skin cloak, fur-lined leather girdle, leather breast band, loin cloth, high boots, small sack, waterskin, 1 week’s iron rations, 3gp (enc. 1 4/6 st) |\n| 5 – 6 | Oracle | Prophecy  Theology | Holy symbol (9-pointed star of Ianna), wavy-bladed short sword, strappy leather armor, crimson and gold chiton, sandals, small sack, waterskin, 1 week’s iron rations, 4gp (enc. 3 4/6 st) |\n| 7 – 8 | Bringer of Mercy | Laying on Hands  Healing | Holy symbol (9-pointed star of Ianna), slender-bladed sword, very sharp dagger, leather armor, white chiton, white sash, high sandals, backpack, 1 lb comfrey, waterskin, 2 weeks’ iron rations, 5gp (enc. 5 st) |\n| 9 – 10 | Bladesinger | Magical Music  Performance (singing) | Holy symbol (9-pointed star of Ianna), long-bladed glaive, polished sword and dagger, strappy leather armor, bladedancer’s head dress (20gp value), crimson chiton, gold silk sash, high boots, backpack, waterskin, 1 weeks’ iron rations, 1gp (enc. 4 5/6 st) |\n| 11 – 12 | Temple Bladedancer | Swashbuckling  Performance (dancing) | Holy symbol (9-pointed star of Ianna), pair of gracefully curved swords, polished leather armor, bladedancer’s head dress (20gp value), golden fur-trimmed cloak, white chiton, high boots, backpack, waterskin, 1 week’s iron rations, 4gp (enc. 3 5/6 st) |\n| 13 – 14 | Veiled Assassin | Quiet Magic  Seduction | Holy symbol (9-pointed star of Ianna), slender short sword, dagger, leather armor, black fur-lined cloak, black silk veil and sash, black linen chiton, long leather gloves, gold bangles (20gp value), high boots, backpack, waterskin, 1 week’s iron rations, 20gp (enc. 4 st) |\n| 15 – 16 | Consular | Contemplation  Diplomacy | Holy symbol (9-pointed star of Ianna), finely made sword and dagger, elegant leather armor, bladedancer’s head dress (20gp value), white silk chiton, high boots, backpack, waterskin, 1 week’s iron rations, 33gp (enc. 3 2/3 st) |\n| 17 – 18 | Warrior Princess | Martial Training (bows/crossbows)  Riding | Holy symbol (9-pointed star of Ianna), composite bow, quiver with 20 arrows, finely made glaive, elegant leather armor, crimson chiton, gold silk sash, high boots, bladedancer’s head dress (20gp value), medium riding horse, riding tack and saddle, leather saddlebag, waterskin, 1 week’s iron rations (enc. 4 3/6 st with rations on horse) |\n\n**Notes:** The Bladesinger’s and Warrior Princess’s glaive is a type of polearm. The Warrior Princess’s Martial Training proficiency grants her an exemption to the limitation on using missile weapons (see p. XX).\n\n### Paladin\n\nKey Attribute: STR and CHA\n\nRequirements: None\n\nHit Dice: 1d8\n\nMaximum Level: 14\n\nPaladins are champions of Law who fight unceasingly against those who seek to extinguish the light of civilization. Wherever the forces of Chaos marshal to threaten man, paladins can be found, battling back the darkness with courage and steel. In the Auran Empire, paladins are, like crusaders, members of holy militant orders. Unlike the crusaders’ orders, which are dedicated to the service of particular Empyrean deities, the paladins’ orders are dedicated to the deified emperors, heroes, and prophets of Aura. The largest such order is the Knights of the Winged Sun, who hold as their patron the exalted hero-king Valerian Bellësareus.\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Paladin Level Progression** | | | | |\n| **Experience** | **Title** | **Level** | **Hit Dice** | **Melee Damage Bonus** |\n| 0 | Bulwark | 1 | 1d8 | +1 |\n| 2,750 | Warder | 2 | 2d8 | +1 |\n| 5,500 | Defender | 3 | 3d8 | +2 |\n| 11,000 | Protector | 4 | 4d8 | +2 |\n| 22,000 | Guardian | 5 | 5d8 | +2 |\n| 44,000 | Sentinel | 6 | 6d8 | +3 |\n| 90,000 | Justiciar | 7 | 7d8 | +3 |\n| 180,000 | Paladin | 8 | 8d8 | +3 |\n| 300,000 | Paladin Lord | 9 | 9d8 | +4 |\n| 420,000 | Paladin Lord, 10th level | 10 | 9d8 + 2\\* | +4 |\n| 540,000 | Paladin Lord, 11th level | 11 | 9d8 + 4\\* | +4 |\n| 660,000 | Paladin Lord, 12th level | 12 | 9d8 + 6\\* | +5 |\n| 780,000 | Paladin Lord, 13th level | 13 | 9d8 + 8\\* | +5 |\n| 900,000 | Lord Protector | 14 | 9d8 + 10\\* | +5 |\n| \\*No adjustment from Constitution applies to this flat bonus. | | | | |\n\n###### Combat Characteristics\n\nPaladins are highly trained combatants specialized in fighting as heavy infantry and heavy cavalry. They lack the versatility of fighters.\n\n**Combat Proficiencies:** Paladins have weapon proficiency with all swords (including daggers, short swords, swords, and two-handed swords) and all spears (including lances, javelins, polearms, and spears). They have armor proficiency with all armor. They have fighting style proficiency with all fighting styles.\n\n**Combat Progression:** Paladin advance in attack throws and saving throws by two points every three levels of experience. They increase their base damage roll from successful melee attacks (but not missile attacks) by +1 at 1st level, and by an additional +1 at 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th level. They can cleave after killing a foe a maximum of once per round per class level.\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Paladin Attack and Saving Throws** | | | | | |  |\n| **Level** | **Paralysis** | **Death** | **Blast** | **Implements** | **Spells** | **Attack Throw** |\n| 1 | 13+ | 14+ | 15+ | 16+ | 17+ | 10+ |\n| 2 – 3 | 12+ | 13+ | 14+ | 15+ | 16+ | 9+ |\n| 4 | 11+ | 12+ | 13+ | 14+ | 15+ | 8+ |\n| 5 – 6 | 10+ | 11+ | 12+ | 13+ | 14+ | 7+ |\n| 7 | 9+ | 10+ | 11+ | 12+ | 13+ | 6+ |\n| 8 – 9 | 8+ | 9+ | 10+ | 11+ | 12+ | 5+ |\n| 10 | 7+ | 8+ | 9+ | 10+ | 11+ | 4+ |\n| 11 – 12 | 6+ | 7+ | 8+ | 9+ | 10+ | 3+ |\n| 13 | 5+ | 6+ | 7+ | 8+ | 9+ | 2+ |\n| 14 | 4+ | 5+ | 6+ | 7+ | 8+ | 1+ |\n\n###### Starting Class Powers\n\nIn exchange for their devotion to Law, paladins receive many powers to aid them in their crusades against Chaos. At the start of play, paladins have the following class powers:\n\n**Aura of Protection:** Paladins are protected by a magical aura that grants them a +1 bonus to AC and a +1 bonus to saving throws against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures. The paladin’s aura of protection appears as a golden halo when viewed with *discern good, discern magic,* or *true seeing.*\n\n**Lay on Hands:** By calling on the higher powers of Law, the paladin can lay on hands to heal injuries. If he lays hands on a wounded creature, he can restore 2 hit points per experience level. If he lays hands on an incapacitated creature, he can grant a bonus to their Mortal Wounds throw of one-half his class level (round up). If he lays hands on a paralyzed creature, he can cure the paralysis. The paladin can use his power to lay on hands once per day. He can select the Laying on Hands proficiency to gain additional uses of the power per day. (This class power is the equivalent of one rank of Laying on Hands proficiency).\n\n**Manual of Arms:** The paladin is highly experienced in military discipline, physical fitness, and weapon drill. He can automatically identify the battle standards, equipment, great captains, military slang, and rank insignia of his homeland. He can identify those of other realms with a proficiency throw of 11+. He can fight as a regular (rather than irregular) troop in formed and loose units. He can begin play as a member of a legion, mercenary’s guild, or other military organization (Judge’s discretion). (This class power is equivalent to one rank of the Manual of Arms proficiency.)\n\n**Sanctified Body:** Paladins are completely immune to the ravages of disease, including magical diseases. This enables them to go on long crusades without succumbing to the illnesses that kill many soldiers, as well as to face dread foes such as mummies or werewolves without fear of corruption. (This class power is the equivalent of the Divine Health proficiency.)\n\n**Sense Evil:** The paladin can detect creatures with evil intentions, magic items with evil enchantments, sinkholes of evil, enchanted creatures of Chaotic alignment, incarnations of Chaotic alignment, and undead within 45’. Other types of creatures, even if Chaotic, are not detected unless they have actively evil intentions against the paladin. Poisons, physical traps, and natural animals are neither good nor evil, so they are not detected by this spell. The paladin sees the evil creatures or objects with a sinister red glow around them, but the glow cannot be seen by anyone else. The paladin must have line of sight on the evil (e.g. the power does not work through walls). If the creature or object is hidden or invisible, the paladin will only see the glow and not the source of the evil. Sensing evil requires one full round of quiet concentration to activate. The effect lasts as long as the paladin continues to concentrate, to a maximum of one round per level. The effect can be used once per turn (10 minutes). (This class power is the equivalent of the Sensing Evil proficiency.)\n\n###### Additional Class Powers\n\nWhen they advance in level, paladins gain the following additional class powers:\n\n**Holy Fervor (5th level):** The paladin’s presence inspires troops he leads. Any hirelings of the same religion as the paladin gain a +1 bonus to their morale score whenever he personally leads them. This bonus stacks with any modifiers from the paladin’s Charisma or proficiencies.\n\n**Fortress (9th level):** By acquiring a **fortress** or other stronghold worth at least 15,000gp, the paladin can attract followers to his service. 5d6 x 10 0th level troops and 1d6 paladins of 1st – 3rd level arrive to serve him within 1d3 months of him acquiring the fortress. If the paladin already has a fortress, the followers arrive to serve him within 1d3 months of him reaching 9th level. The paladin must pay his followers the ordinary rates for mercenaries and henchmen or they leave his service. In time, the paladin might become a great lord, commanding armies to conquer vast realms. Additional rules for fortresses are detailed in the **Campaigns** chapter (p.

Unlike crusaders, who are trained in fighting, priestesses belong to non-military orders, and dedicate themselves to spell-casting, ministry, and prayer. Within the Auran Empire, priestesses belong to the Sisters of Mourning (Calefa), Keepers of the Hearth (Mityara), or Temple of the Veil (Ianna).\n\nMost priestesses do not become adventurers, but every year a few women are sent forth from their temples into the world at the instructions of the matriarchs. Most of these priestesses fall prey to the world or its temptations, but a few rise in power and broaden the reach and influence of their order.\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Priestess Level Progression** | | | | **Priestess Spell Progression** | | | | | | |\n| **Experience** | **Title** | **Level** | **Hit Dice** |  | **1** | **2** | **3** | **4** | **5** | **6** |\n| 0 | Novice | 1 | 1d4 |  | 2 | - | - | - | - | - |\n| 2,000 | Daughter | 2 | 2d4 |  | 3 | - | - | - | - | - |\n| 4,000 | Sister-Initiate | 3 | 3d4 |  | 3 | 2 | - | - | - | - |\n| 8,000 | Sister | 4 | 4d4 |  | 3 | 3 | - | - | - | - |\n| 16,000 | Sister-Disciple | 5 | 5d4 |  | 3 | 3 | 2 | - | - | - |\n| 32,000 | Priestess | 6 | 6d4 |  | 3 | 3 | 3 | - | - | - |\n| 65,000 | Mother | 7 | 7d4 |  | 5 | 3 | 3 | 2 | - | - |\n| 130,000 | Revered Mother | 8 | 8d4 |  | 5 | 5 | 3 | 3 | - | - |\n| 230,000 | Matriarch | 9 | 9d4 |  | 5 | 5 | 5 | 3 | 2 | - |\n| 330,000 | Matriarch, 10th level | 10\\* | 9d4 + 1 |  | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 3 | - |\n| 430,000 | Matriarch, 11th level | 11\\* | 9d4 + 2 |  | 6 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 3 | 2 |\n| 530,000 | Matriarch, 12th level | 12\\* | 9d4 + 3 |  | 6 | 6 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 3 |\n| 630,000 | Matriarch, 13th level | 13\\* | 9d4 + 4 |  | 6 | 6 | 6 | 5 | 5 | 3 |\n| 730,000 | High Priestess | 14\\* | 9d4 + 5 |  | 6 | 6 | 6 | 6 | 5 | 5 |\n| \\*No adjustment from Constitution applies to this flat bonus. | | | | | | | | | | |\n\n###### Combat Characteristics\n\nAs healers and missionaries of their goddesses, priestesses receive little combat training.\n\n**Combat Proficiencies:** Priestesses have weapon proficiency with clubs, daggers, darts, and staffs. They have no proficiency with armor. They have fighting style proficiency with the two-handed weapon style (allowing them to use a staff with both hands), but not with the dual weapon or weaponand shield styles.\n\n**Combat Progression:** Priestesses advance in attack throws only two points every six levels of experience (i.e. the same as mages), but they advance in saving throws by two points every fourlevels of experience (i.e. as crusaders). They do not gain any bonus to damage as they advance in level. They cannot cleave, regardless of their level.\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Priestess (Crusader) Saving Throws** | | | | | |\n| **Level** | **Paralysis** | **Death** | **Blast** | **Implements** | **Spells** |\n| 1 – 2 | 13+ | 10+ | 16+ | 13+ | 15+ |\n| 3 – 4 | 12+ | 9+ | 15+ | 12+ | 14+ |\n| 5 – 6 | 11+ | 8+ | 14+ | 11+ | 13+ |\n| 7 – 8 | 10+ | 7+ | 13+ | 10+ | 12+ |\n| 9 – 10 | 9+ | 6+ | 12+ | 9+ | 11+ |\n| 11 – 12 | 8+ | 5+ | 11+ | 8+ | 10+ |\n| 13 – 14 | 7+ | 4+ | 10+ | 7+ | 9+ |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Priestess (Mage) Attack Throws** | |\n| **Level** | **Attack Throw** |\n| 1 – 3 | 10+ |\n| 4 – 6 | 9+ |\n| 7 – 9 | 8+ |\n| 10 – 12 | 7+ |\n| 13 – 14 | 6+ |\n\n###### Starting Class Powers\n\nAt the start of play, priestesses have the following class powers. Priestesses of goddesses other than Mityara might replace the Consolation, Diplomacy, Lay on Hands, and Purity of the Body class powers with other abilities (Judge’s discretion).\n\n**Consolation**: The priestess can console the faithful to better endure pain and suffering while they heal. Each use of the ability requires 1 turn (10 minutes), during which the target creature is reassured through prayer and pastoral guidance. Once consoled, the creature’s natural healing from resting is doubled for the next day. The priestess cannot console wounded creatures of a different alignment or religion, nor can she console creatures that aren’t sapient. This ability only applies to healing from resting.\n\n**Diplomacy:** In order to carry out missionary work, priestesses are trained in the art of protocol. They receive a +1 bonus on all reaction rolls when they attempt to parley with intelligent creatures. (This class power is equivalent to one rank of Diplomacy proficiency.)\n\n**Divine Magic:** Priestesses can manifest their goddess’s power in the form of divine spells, which are granted through prayer and worship. The number and levels of spells the priestess can cast in a single day are listed on the Priestess Spell Progression table. The priestess’s spell selection is limited to the spells in her order’s **repertoire** (which is different than that of the crusader). See the **Spells** chapter for a list of all available spells.\n\n**Lay on Hands:** By calling on her goddess, the priestess can lay on hands to heal injuries. If she lays hands on a wounded creature, she can restore 2 hit points per experience level. If she lays hands on an incapacitated creature, she can grant a bonus to their Mortal Wounds throw of one-half his class level (round up). If she lays hands on a paralyzed creature, she can cure the paralysis. The priestess can use her power to lay on hands once per day. She can select the Laying on Hands proficiency to gain additional uses of the power per day. (This class power is the equivalent of one rank of Laying on Hands proficiency).\n\n**Purity of the Body:** The goddess shelters her priestesses from the effects of pestilence, so they can better minister to the sick and dying. The priestess is immune to all forms of disease, including magical diseases caused by spells, mummies, or lycanthropes.\n\n**Theology:** Every priestess receives religious instruction at an abbey, cloister, or temple. She can begin play as a member of a religious hierarchy (Judge’s discretion). She can acquire congregants through proselytizing. She can automatically identify religious symbols, spell signatures, trappings, and holy days of her own faith, and can recognize those of other faiths with a proficiency throw of 11+. Rare or occult cults might be harder to recognize. (This class power is the equivalent of one rank of Theology proficiency).\n\n###### Additional Class Powers\n\nWhen they advance in level, priestesses gain the following additional class powers:\n\n**Minor Magical Research (5th level):** The priestess can scribe magical scrolls and brew potions.\n\n**Cloister (9th level):** By acquiring a cloister worth at least 15,000gp, the priestess can attract followers to her service. If the priestess has had a good and noble adventuring career, the matriarch of her current cloister will pay for up to 15,000gp of the construction costs, provided that the new cloister remains a branch of the older cloister until the priestess reaches 12th level (at which time it will become independent). 1d2 x 10 1st level priestesses and 1d6 x 30 normal women who want to become priestesses arrive within 1d3 months of her acquiring the cloister. If the priestess has already established a cloister, the followers arrive within 1d3 months of her reaching 9th level. Every year, 80% of the previous year’s trainees will leave in frustration or find they lack the discipline for a life of faith, but 1d6 x 20 normal women will arrive to replace them. A normal woman in training typically takes 2 years to become a 1st level priestess. Additional rules for cloisters are detailed in the **Campaigns** chapter.\n\n**Major Magical Research (9th level):** The priestess can create more powerful magic items such as weapons, rings, and staffs.\n\n**Supreme Magical Research (11th level):** The priestess can learn and cast ritual divine spells of great power (7th, 8th, and 9th level) and craft magical constructs. If chaotic, the priestess can create necromantic servants and become undead. Rules for magic research can be found in the **Campaigns** chapter (p. XX).\n\n###### Code of Behavior\n\nLike crusaders, priestesses must uphold the strictures of their order and their goddess. If the Judge has not specified particular religious orders in his campaign, the default priestess is assumed to be from the Keepers of the Hearth Fire, the order devoted to Mityara, Goddess of Civilization and Mercy. The strictures of their order are many.\n\n* The priestess must always wear the white mantles and shawls of their order when in public.\n* The priestess must offer prayers to Mityara at dusk. Offering prayers requires one hour (6 turns).\n* Every seventh day, the priestess must keep a flame lit throughout the night, representing the light of civilization.\n* The priestess must refrain from the taking of human or demi-human life by any means. (Of course, beastmen, undead, and other monsters are abominations and should be put down!)\n* The priestess must remain both chaste and celibate until she reaches the rank of Mother (7th level).\n* The priestess must not use her divine magic for unlawful or chaotic purposes.\n\nIf a priestess ever falls from favor, due to violating the strictures of her faith, the goddess might impose penalties upon the priestess. As with crusaders, these penalties are entirely up to the Judge.\n\n###### Class Proficiencies\n\n**Proficiency Progression:** At 1st level, priestesses select one class proficiency from their class proficiency list and one general proficiency from the general proficiency list. They select an additional class proficiency at 4th, 8th, and 12th level. They select an additional general proficiency at 5th, 9th, and 13th level.\n\n**Priestess Proficiency List:** Alchemy, Animal Husbandry, Arcane Dabbling, Armor Training, Beast Friendship, Bright Lore of Aura, Contemplation, Divine Blessing, Familiar, Healing, Illusion Resistance, Knowledge, Laying on Hands, Loremastery, Magical Engineering, Magical Music, Mastery of Enchantments & Illusions, Mystic Aura, Naturalism, Performance, Prestidigitation, Profession, Prophecy, Quiet Magic, Sensing Evil, Sensing Power, Syncretism, Unflappable Casting\n\n###### Priestess Templates\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **3d6**  **Roll** | **Template** | **Proficiencies** | **Starting Equipment** |\n| 3 – 4 | Anchorite | Quiet Magic  Survival | Holy symbol (white lady of Mityara), aged and dusty staff, animal skin cloak, leather girdle, leather breast band, loin cloth, high boots, small sack, waterskin, 1 week’s iron rations, 9gp (enc. 2 3/6 st) |\n| 5 – 6 | Oracle | Prophecy  Performance (storytelling) | Holy symbol (white lady of Mityara), slender whitewood staff, white chiton, sandals, small sack, flask of holy water, waterskin, 1 week’s iron rations, 5gp (enc. 2 4/6 st) |\n| 7 – 8 | Chantress | Magical Music  Performance (singing) | Holy symbol (white lady of Mityara), slender whitewood staff, priestess’s headdress (20gp), white chiton, gold sash, high boots, backpack, waterskin, 2 weeks’ iron rations, 19gp (enc. 3 3/6 st) |\n| 9 – 10 | Canoness | Contemplation  Theology 2 | Holy symbol (white lady of Mityara), slender whitewood staff, priestess’s head dress (20gp value), white chiton, gold silk sash, high boots, backpack, flask of holy water, waterskin, 1 week’s iron rations, 15gp (enc. 3 3/6 st) |\n| 11 – 12 | Medician | Laying on Hands  Healing | Holy symbol (white lady of Mityara), slender whitewood staff, white chiton, gold silk sash, high boots, backpack, 2 lb comfrey, 2 lb goldenrod, 2 lb woundwort, 2 lb horsetail, waterskin, 1 week’s iron rations, (enc. 3 5/6 st) |\n| 13-14 | Beatific | Mystic Aura  Seduction | Holy symbol (white lady of Mityara), slender white wood staff, priestess’s head dress (20gp value), white chiton, gold silk sash and veil, high boots, backpack, flask of holy water, waterskin, 2 weeks’ iron rations, 28gp (3 4/6 st) |\n| 15 – 16 | Missionary | Mastery of Enchantments & Illusions  Language | Holy symbol (white lady of Mityara), slender whitewood staff, priestess’s head dress (20gp value), white silk chiton, white silk sash, high boots, backpack, flask of holy water, holy book (The Laws of the Light), waterskin, 1 week’s iron rations, 12gp (enc. 3 1/6 st) |\n| 17 – 18 | Lightbringer | Divine Blessing  Leadership | Holy symbol (white lady of Mityara), slender whitewood staff, white silk chiton, gold silk sash, high boots, light riding horse, riding tack and saddle, 2 leather saddlebags, waterskin, 1 week’s iron rations, 4gp (enc. 1 2/6 st with rations on horse) |\n\n**Notes:** None.\n\n### Shaman\n\nKey Attribute: WIL and CON\n\nRequirements: None\n\nHit Dice: 1d6\n\nMaximum Level: 14\n\nShamans are the spiritual guides of tribal peoples. A shaman is responsible for the sacred needs of his tribe, mediating with the tribe’s ancestral spirits and totem animals, and conducting the tribe’s religious rituals. Through his relationship with sacred powers such as gods, powerful ancestors, and animal spirits, the shaman can heal the sick and afflicted, divine wise courses of action, and smite the enemies of his tribe. In the Auran Empire, members of the class might be druids of Rorn, rune-casters of Jutland, medicine men of the Skysos horse peoples, or witch doctors of the Ivory Kingdoms. While most shamans spend their entire lives with their tribe, some shamans are called to adventure by dreams and visions; others adventure out of a desire to learn secrets unavailable in their homelands. A few tragic shamans become adventures to gain the power necessary to avenge the destruction of their tribe.\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Shaman Level Progression** | | | | **Shaman Spell Progression** | | | | | |\n| **Experience** | **Title** | **Level** | **Hit Dice** | **1** | **2** | **3** | **4** | **5** | **6** |\n| 0 | Spirit Whisperer | 1 | 1d6 | 1 | - | - | - | - | - |\n| 1,500 | Village Healer | 2 | 2d6 | 2 | - | - | - | - | - |\n| 3,000 | Tribal Priest | 3 | 3d6 | 2 | 1 | - | - | - | - |\n| 6,000 | Medicine Man | 4 | 4d6 | 2 | 2 | - | - | - | - |\n| 12,000 | Totem Bearer | 5 | 5d6 | 2 | 2 | 1 | - | - | - |\n| 24,000 | Witch Doctor | 6 | 6d6 | 2 | 2 | 2 | - | - | - |\n| 50,000 | Spirit Walker | 7 | 7d6 | 3 | 2 | 2 | 1 | - | - |\n| 100,000 | Tribal Elder | 8 | 8d6 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 2 | - | - |\n| 200,000 | Shaman | 9 | 9d6 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 1 | - |\n| 300,000 | Shaman, 10th level | 10 | 9d6 + 1\\* | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 2 | - |\n| 400,000 | Shaman, 11th level | 11 | 9d6 + 2\\* | 4 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 1 |\n| 500,000 | Shaman, 12th level | 12 | 9d6 + 3\\* | 4 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 2 |\n| 600,000 | Shaman, 13th level | 13 | 9d6 + 4\\* | 4 | 4 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 2 |\n| 700,000 | Grandfather of Totems | 14 | 9d6 + 5\\* | 4 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 3 | 3 |\n| \\*No adjustment from Constitution applies to this flat bonus. | | | | | | | | | |\n\n###### Combat Characteristics\n\nShamans are skilled combatants, albeit not as good as fighters. They tend to be more lightly armored than crusaders and use only weapons that are common to their tribe or people.\n\n**Combat Proficiencies:** Shamans have weapon proficiency with daggers, hand axes, short swords, sling-staffs, staffs, and spears. They have armor proficiency with light and very light armor. They have fighting style proficiency with the weapon and shield and two-handed weapon styles, but not with the dual weapon style.\n\n**Combat Progression:** Shamans advance in attack throws and saving throws by two points every four levels of experience (i.e. the same progression as crusaders). They do not gain any bonus to damage as they advance in level. They can cleave after killing a foe a maximum of once per round per every two class levels (rounded down).\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Shaman (Crusader) Attack and Saving Throws** | | | | | |  |\n| **Level** | **Paralysis** | **Death** | **Blast** | **Implements** | **Spells** | **Attack Throw** |\n| 1 – 2 | 13+ | 10+ | 16+ | 13+ | 15+ | 10+ |\n| 3 – 4 | 12+ | 9+ | 15+ | 12+ | 14+ | 9+ |\n| 5 – 6 | 11+ | 8+ | 14+ | 11+ | 13+ | 8+ |\n| 7 – 8 | 10+ | 7+ | 13+ | 10+ | 12+ | 7+ |\n| 9 – 10 | 9+ | 6+ | 12+ | 9+ | 11+ | 6+ |\n| 11 – 12 | 8+ | 5+ | 11+ | 8+ | 10+ | 5+ |\n| 13 – 14 | 7+ | 4+ | 10+ | 7+ | 9+ | 4+ |\n\n###### Starting Class Powers\n\nAt the start of play, shamans have the following class powers.\n\n**Commune with Spirits:** As the intermediary between his tribe and the sacred powers that watch over them, the shaman has the ability to **commune with spirits** once per week. When using this power, he can choose between the ancestral spirits of his tribe, or the natural spirits of his current location. The spirits will answer three yes-or-no questions to the best of their ability. They are very wise regarding their tribal history or local area, but not omniscient, so they might not be able to answer some questions accurately. Such details are left to the Judge’s discretion. The ritual to commune with the ancestor spirits takes 1 turn to complete, during which time the shaman is “out of body” and entirely helpless. The ritual is so taxing that it can be performed but once per week. Once a year, on a particular sacred day (determined by the Judge), the shaman can ask twice the normal number of questions of his ancestors without angering them. Communing with the spirits in a sinkhole of evil is a dangerous and chaotic act that might violate his code of behavior or put him at risk of haunting or possession (Judge’s discretion).\n\n**Divine Magic:** Shamans can manifest the power of their tribal gods and spirits in the form of divine spells, which are granted through prayer and worship. The number and levels of spells the shaman can cast in a single day are listed on the Shaman Spell Progression table. The shaman’s spell selection is limited to the spells in his order’s **repertoire** (which is different than that of the crusader). See the **Spells** chapter for a list of all available spells.\n\n**Tribal Traditions:** Every shaman receives instruction in the sacred rites and religious traditions of his tribe. He can begin play as a shaman of an existing tribe in the region (Judge’s discretion). He can acquire congregants through proselytizing. He can automatically identify religious symbols, spell signatures, trappings, and holy days of his own tribal traditions, and can recognize those of other faiths with a proficiency throw of 11+. Rare or occult cults might be harder to recognize. (This class power is equivalent to one rank of Theology proficiency).\n\n**Totem Animal:** Every shaman has a **totem animal** as a companion. The totem animal physically represents the shaman’s relationship with his sacred powers. The Totem Animals table, below, lists the benefits and abilities of several sample totems. The Judge can create additional totems at his discretion. The totem animal should be a creature appropriate to the character’s attributes and tribal traditions. For example, a shaman with high STR might have a bear totem, while a shaman with high WIL might have an owl totem and one with high CHA might choose an eagle totem. At a minimum, the shaman must possess an attribute of at least 9 in his totem animal’s key attribute. Over time, the shaman will come to resemble his totem animal. A wolf shaman might develop yellow eyes and sharp canines, while a bear shaman might grow husky and hirsute.\n\nThe totem animal has human-like intelligence, with Intellect equal to half the shaman’s Intellect. It can understand the shaman’s speech, and the shaman can understand his totem animal’s speech, though no one else can without resorting to *speak with beasts*.So long as the shaman upholds his tribal traditions, the totem animal will be utterly loyal to the shaman and will fight for him, perform services, and obey his commands.\n\nWhile the totem animal is alive, the shaman receives the animal’s **totem benefit**. The totem benefit is a bonus proficiency related to the totem. For example, a shaman with a cobra totem animal has the Combat Reflexes proficiency so long as he is within 30’ of his totem animal.\n\nBecause it is partly a creature of the shaman’s own spirit, the totem animal always has a number of Hit Dice equal to one less than the shaman’s own (1/2 HD when the shaman is 1st level) with 4 hp per HD. If a totem animal has fewer Hit Dice than those normally possessed by such an animal, it will appear as a smaller, younger creature of its type. If it has more HD, it will appear as a larger, fiercer variant. The animal’s baseline characteristics are adjusted based on its current Hit Dice relative to the Hit Dice of an ordinary animal of its type:\n\n* Attack throws are as a monster of its HD; saving throws are as a fighter of half its HD.\n* AC increases or decreases by 1 per 2 HD of difference, to a minimum of 0 and maximum of its own ordinary HD. (Round differences of 0.5 to even).\n* Average damage for its attack routine (as a whole) increases or decreases by 2 per HD of difference. The Judge should decide how this is manifested, e.g. does it have a bigger bite, sharper claws, etc.\n\nEXAMPLE: A shaman calls a lion totem animal. An ordinary lion has AC 3, HD 5, and an attack routine consisting of 2 claws (1d4+1) and 1 bite (1d10). Its average damage is (3.5 + 3.5 + 5.5) = 12.5 per attack routine. When the shaman is 1st level, his totem animal appears as a lion cub. It has 1/2 HD, making it 4.5 HD less than an ordinary lion. 4.5 is rounded to 4. AC is decreased by 1 per 2 HD of difference, so the lion cub’s AC is reduced from 3 to 1. Average damage decreases by 2 per HD of difference, so average damage is reduced by 8 points, from 12.5 to 4.5 The Judge decides it attacks with 2 claws (1d3-1) and 1 bite (1d4). When the shaman is 6th level, his totem animal has 5 HD, so it has the characteristics of an ordinary lion. When the shaman is 14th level, his totem animal has 13 HD, making it 8 HD more than an ordinary lion. AC is increased by 4, capped at its ordinary HD of 5. Average damage is increased by 16, to 28.5. the Judge decides it attacks with 2 claws (2d6) and 1 bite (3d8+1).\n\nIf the totem animal is ever killed, the shaman must save versus Death or instantly take damage equal to the totem animal’s maximum total hit points. If a shaman’s totem animal is slain, it can’t be *restored**to**life*or *resurrected*.However, a new totem animal of the same type will appear the next time the shaman gains a level of experience. Except where mentioned above, totem animals have the characteristics of a normal animal of their type. These are listed on the Totem Animals table for quick reference; see the ***ACKS II Monstrous Manual***for full details. HD are listed for comparison purposes. The Judge can devise new totem animals if desired.\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Totem Animals** | | | |\n| **Totem Animal** | **Key Attribute** | **Totem Benefit** | **Characteristics** |\n| Bear | STR | Berserkergang | Spd 120’, AC 3, HD 4, #AT 3, Dmg 1d3/1d3/1d6, hug |\n| Cheetah | DEX | Running | Spd 360’, AC 5, HD 2+2, #AT 3, Dmg 1d2/1d2/1d4, pounce |\n| Crocodile | CON | Combat Ferocity | Spd 60’/90’ swim, AC 4, HD 2, #AT 1, Dmg 1d8 |\n| Crow/Raven | INT | Divine Blessing | Spd 330’ fly, AC 1, HD ¼, #AT 1, Dmg 1d2-1 |\n| Dog | CHA | Alertness | Spd 180’, AC 2, HD 1+1, #AT 1, Dmg 1d4 |\n| Eagle/Hawk | CHA | Command | Spd 480’ fly, AC 3, HD 1+1, #AT 2, Dmg 1d3/1d3, dive |\n| Elk | CON | Contemplation | Spd 180’, AC 2, HD 4, #AT 1, Dmg 1d10 |\n| Goat | WIL | Climbing | Spd 150’, AC 2, HD 1, Dmg 1d4 |\n| Horse | CON | Mounted Combat | Spd 210’, AC 2, HD 2, #AT 2, Dmg 1d4/1d4 |\n| Hyena | CHA | Weapon Focus | Spd 150’, AC 2, HD 2+1, #AT 2, Dmg 1d8, bone crush |\n| Jackal | INT | Combat Trickery | Spd 180’, AC 2, HD 1-1, #AT 1, Dmg 1d4 |\n| Lion | STR | Divine Health | Spd 180’, AC 3, HD 5, #AT 3, Dmg 1d4+1/1d4+1/1d10, pounce |\n| Monkey | DEX | Prestidigitation | Spd 120’, AC 2, HD 1, #AT 1, Dmg 1d3 |\n| Rat | WIL | Quiet Magic | Spd 120’/ 60’ swim, AC 2, HD 1/2, #AT 1, Dmg 1d3 |\n| Owl | INT | Sensing Power | Spd 300’ fly, AC 3, HD ½, #AT 2, Dmg 1d2/1d2, dive attack |\n| Python | STR | Laying on Hands | Spd 90’, AC 3, HD 5, #AT 2, Dmg 1d4/2d8, constriction |\n| Viper | DEX | Combat Reflexes | Spd 90’, AC 3, HD 2, #AT 1, Dmg 1d4, poison |\n| Wolf | WIL | Ambushing | Spd 180’, AC 2, HD 2+2, #AT 1, Dmg 1d6 |\n\n###### Additional Class Powers\n\nWhen they advance in level, shamans gain the following additional class powers:\n\n**Spiritual Ritual (3rd level):** The shaman can perform a spiritual ritual to re-gain the ability to cast a spell of a level he had previously expended. Each spiritual ritual requires one hour (6 turns). In contrast to the austere contemplation of more civilized crusaders, spiritual rituals involve ecstatic dancing, wild drumming, chanting, and intoxicating smoke. The shaman can perform a spiritual ritual as often as desired, but cannot regain the same level of spell more than once per day.\n\n**Minor Magical Research (5th level):** At 5th level or higher, the shaman can scribe scrolls and brew potions.\n\n**Shapechanging (5th level):** The physical link between the shaman and his totem becomes strong enough for the shaman to **shapechange** into his totem animal. The shaman remains in his new shape until he changes back. A 5th level shaman can initially shapechange once per day. For example, if he begins the day in human form, he can shapechange into his totem animal form, but he then has to remain in totem animal form until the following day, when he can change back to his human shape. With each level of experience gained, the shaman can change shape one additional time per day.\n\nWhen in totem animal form, the shaman has the movement, armor class, attacks, damage, and powers listed on the Totem Animals table. He retains his normal Hit Dice, hit points, attack throws, and saving throws. If the shaman is of greater Hit Dice than his animal type, he will appear as a bigger, stronger version of the animal, to a maximum of twice normal size. For example, a 10th level shaman in lion shape would appear as a huge predator, twice the mass of a normal lion. Apart from size, the shaman is indistinguishable from a normal animal. The totem animal shape does not detect as magical, is not detected by spells that reveal illusions, and cannot be **dispelled**. Changing shape can be performed during combat as an action in lieu of an attack.\n\n**Spiritwalking (7th level):** The shaman’s spiritual powers have grown strong enough for him to spiritwalk. After 1 turn (10 minutes) of chanting, the shaman enters a deep trance during which his spirit walks free of his body. A spiritwalking shaman’s spirit can assume either human or totem animal shape as desired. The effects are otherwise identical to the 5th level spell *spiritwalk.* Spiritwalking is so taxing that it can be performed but once per week.\n\n**Major Magical Research (9th level):** The shaman can create more powerful magic items such as weapons, rings, and staffs.\n\n**Medicine Lodge (9th level):** By acquiring a **medicine lodge** worth at least 15,000gp, the shaman can attract followers to his service. So long as the shaman is currently in favor with his tribe’s powers, he can build his lodge at half the normal price due to divine intervention. 5d6 x 10 0th level tribesmen and 1d6 shamans of 1st level of the same tribe arrive to serve him within 1d3 months of him acquiring the medicine lodge. If the shaman has already acquired a medicine lodge, the followers arrive to serve him within 1d3 months of him reaching 9th level. The followers are fanatically brave and completely loyal (loyalty +4 and morale +4). Despite their loyalty, the followersmust be paid a fair wage or they might eventually leave his service. Additional rules for medicine lodges are detailed in the **Campaign** chapter.\n\n**Supreme Magical Research (11th level):** The shaman can learn and cast ritual divine spells of great power (7th, 8th, and 9th level) and craft magical constructs. XX).\n\n###### Code of Behavior\n\nShamans must uphold the traditions of their ancestors and the gods and spirits they serve. Each shaman’s traditions are determined by the Judge based on the character’s origination and history. If the Judge has not specified particular tribes and traditions for his campaign, the following traditions apply:\n\n* The shaman must always display a holy symbol of his tribe and totem somewhere on his person when in public.\n* The shaman must make offerings of food and drink to his tribe’s ancestors, gods, and spirits at dusk each day. Offering food and drink requires one hour (6 turns). The offering costs 1cp and weighs 1/6 st.\n* The shaman must strive to uphold the noble virtues of his totem. For instance, a bear shaman must strive to be fierce and stalwart, a dog shaman must strive to be alert and loyal, and so on.\n* The shaman must not wield strange weapons foreign to his tribe.\n* The shaman must not use his divine magic for purposes that would damage or dishonor his tribe, or to deliberately or negligently cause harm to the animals he calls to serve him.\n\nIf a shaman ever falls from favor by failing to uphold the tribal traditions, the gods and spirits he serves might impose penalties upon him. As with crusaders, these penalties are entirely up to the Judge.\n\n###### Class Proficiencies\n\n**Proficiency Progression:** At 1st level, shamans select one class proficiency from their class proficiency list and one general proficiency from the general proficiency list. They select an additional class proficiency at 4th, 8th, and 12th level. They select an additional general proficiency at 5th, 9th, and 13th level.\n\n**Shaman Proficiency List:** Animal Husbandry, Animal Training, Battle Magic, Beast Friendship, Berserkergang, Command, Diplomacy, Divine Blessing, Divine Health, Elementalism, Fighting Style Specialization, Healing, Laying on Hands, Leadership, Loremastery, Magical Engineering, Magical Music, Naturalism, Passing Without Trace, Prestidigitation, Quiet Magic, Sensing Evil, Sensing Power, Syncretism, Theology, Tracking, Unflappable Casting, Weapon Focus\n\n###### Shaman Templates\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **3d6**  **Roll** | **Template** | **Proficiencies** | **Starting Equipment** |\n| 3 – 4 | Pariah | Syncretism  Survival  **Quiet****Magic** | **Rat****totem****animal**, heretical holy symbol (horned rat), club, hide armor, itchy wool tunic and pants, rawhide belt, sandals, small sack, waterskin, 2 weeks’ iron rations (enc. 3 4/6 st) |\n| 5 – 6 | Wise Man | Loremastery  Knowledge (history)  **Sensing****Power** | **Owl****totem****animal**, holy symbol (silver crescent), quarterstaff, leather armor, grey wool tunic and pants, embossed belt, low boots, backpack, waterskin, 2 weeks’ iron rations, 7gp (enc. 5 3/6 st) |\n| 7 – 8 | Warchanter | Battle Magic  Performance (chanting)  **Berserkergang** | **Bear totem animal**,holy symbol (bear’s teeth), iron spear, round wooden shield, leather armor, wool tunic and pants, embossed belt, low boots, backpack, waterskin, 1 week’s iron rations (enc. 5 3/61/2 st) |\n| 9 – 10 | Runecaster | Elementalism  Craft (rune-carving)  **Ambushing** | **Wolf totem animal**,holy symbol (runestone), hand axe, wooden shield, leather armor, wool tunic and pants, embossed belt, low boots, backpack, carving knife, flask of holy water, waterskin, 1 week’s iron rations, 1gp (enc. 5 st) |\n| 11 – 12 | Druid | Beast Friendship  Naturalism  **Divine****Blessing** | **Raven totem animal***,* holy symbol (golden sickle), whitewood spear, sickle sword, dagger, shield, leather armor under white druid’s robes, leather belt, low boots, backpack, flask of holy water, 1 lb garlic, 1 lb wolfsbane, waterskin, 1 week’s iron rations, 8gp (enc. 6 2/6 st) |\n| 13 – 14 | Snake Handler | Divine Health  Healing  **Laying****on****Hands** | **Python totem animal**, holy symbol (two snakes coiled around rod), long staff, dagger, leather armor under forest green robes, embossed belt, low boots, backpack, 2 lbs birthwort, 2 lbs comfrey, 2 lbs horsetail, 2 lbs woundwort, waterskin, 1 week’s iron rations, 2gp (enc. 6 st) |\n| 15 – 16 | Spirit Raiser | Sensing Evil  Leadership  **Command** | **Eagle totem animal**,holy symbol (eagle on sun), quarterstaff, dagger, leather armor under blue robes, leather belt, low boots, backpack, belt pouch, 2 flasks of holy water, tinderbox, 6 tallow candles, 4 lbs garlic, waterskin, 1 week’s iron rations, 25gp (7 st) |\n| 17 – 18 | Nomad Shaman | Unflappable Casting  Riding  **Mounted Combat** | **Horse totem animal**,holy symbol (engraved horn),scimitar, round wooden shield, leather armor, wool cloak, wool tunic and pants, leather gloves, leather belt, high boots, backpack, belt pouch, steppe riding horse, riding saddle and tack, 2 leather saddlebags, 2 weeks’ iron rations, 21gp (3 4/6 st with rations on horse) |\n\n**Notes:** The totem animal and totem proficiency that each shaman template begins with is noted in bold. The druid’s sickle sword is a type of short sword. The nomad shaman’s scimitar is a type of short sword.\n\n### Warlock\n\nKey Attributes: INT and WIL\n\nRequirements: None\n\nHit Dice: 1d4\n\nMaximum Level: 14\n\nWhile mages are sometimes colloquially referred to as warlocks, the true warlock is a far more sinister individual. A warlock is one who seeks alliance with dark beings and pursues forbidden lore, hoping to find a quicker, easier path to power than the methodical practices of magecraft. Many warlocks become adventurers to plumb the secrets of dusty tombs, forgotten crypts, and hidden sanctums. Few do so for heroic motives.\n\nThese practices leave warlocks reviled and condemned in the Auran Empire. The Tower of Knowledge bars known warlocks from its august halls entirely. Warlocks are treated with respect and more than a little fear in the Sunset Kingdoms of Kemesh, Somirea, and Celdorea, and many assume positions of power in those societies.\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Warlock Level Progression** | | | | **Warlock Spell Progression** | | | | | | |\n| **Experience** | **Title** | **Level** | **Hit Dice** |  | **1** | **2** | **3** | **4** | **5** | **6** |\n| 0 | Medium | 1 | 1d4 |  | 1 | - | - | - | - | - |\n| 2,500 | Occultist | 2 | 2d4 |  | 2 | - | - | - | - | - |\n| 5,000 | Spiritualist | 3 | 3d4 |  | 2 | 1 | - | - | - | - |\n| 10,000 | Hexgiver | 4 | 4d4 |  | 2 | 2 | - | - | - | - |\n| 20,000 | Cursebringer | 5 | 5d4 |  | 2 | 2 | 1 | - | - | - |\n| 40,000 | Maleficus | 6 | 6d4 |  | 2 | 2 | 2 | - | - | - |\n| 80,000 | Infernalist | 7 | 7d4 |  | 3 | 2 | 2 | 1 | - | - |\n| 160,000 | Warlock | 8 | 8d4 |  | 3 | 3 | 2 | 2 | - | - |\n| 310,000 | Dread Lord | 9 | 9d4 |  | 3 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 1 | - |\n| 460,000 | Dread Lord, 10th level | 10 | 9d4 + 1\\* |  | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 2 | - |\n| 610,000 | Dread Lord, 11th level | 11 | 9d4 + 2\\* |  | 4 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 1 |\n| 760,000 | Dread Lord, 12th level | 12 | 9d4 + 3\\* |  | 4 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 2 |\n| 910,000 | Dread Lord, 13th level | 13 | 9d4 + 4\\* |  | 4 | 4 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 2 |\n| 1,060,000 | Dread King | 14 | 9d4 + 5\\* |  | 4 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 3 | 3 |\n| \\*No adjustment from Constitution applies to this flat bonus. | | | | | | | | | | | |\n\n###### Combat Characteristics\n\nBecause of their devotion to arcane study, warlocks receive limited combat training. They are quite vulnerable to physical danger, and in an adventuring group they should be protected.\n\n**Combat Proficiencies:** Warlocks have weapon proficiency with daggers, darts, staffs, and whips. They have no armor proficiency. They have fighting style proficiency with the two-handed weapon style (allowing them to use a staff with both hands), but not with the dual weapon or weaponand shield styles.\n\n**Combat Progression:** Warlocks advance in attack throws and saving throws by only two points every six levels of experience (i.e., the same progression as mages). They do not gain any bonus to damage as they advance in level. They cannot cleave, regardless of their level.\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Warlock Attack and Saving Throws** | | | | | |  |\n| **Level** | **Paralysis** | **Death** | **Blast** | **Implements** | **Spells** | **Attack Throw** |\n| 1 – 3 | 13+ | 13+ | 15+ | 11+ | 12+ | 10+ |\n| 4 – 6 | 12+ | 12+ | 14+ | 10+ | 11+ | 9+ |\n| 7 – 9 | 11+ | 11+ | 13+ | 9+ | 10+ | 8+ |\n| 10 – 12 | 10+ | 10+ | 12+ | 8+ | 9+ | 7+ |\n| 13 – 14 | 9+ | 9+ | 11+ | 7+ | 8+ | 6+ |\n\n###### Starting Class Powers\n\nAt the start of play, warlocks have the following class powers.\n\n**Arcane Magic:** Warlocks can learn and cast powerful arcane spells. The number and levels of spells the warlock can cast in a single day are listed on the Warlock Spell Progression table. A warlock’s spell selection is limited to the spells in his **repertoire**. A warlock’s repertoire can include the number of spells up to the number and level of spells listed for his level, increased by his Intellect bonus. More information on casting spells and individual spell descriptions can be found in the **Spells** chapter.\n\n**Dark Path:** Every warlock has chosen to follow a dark path. There are three darks path available: **demonology**, **necromancy**, and **transmogrification**. Each dark path rewards the warlock with one class power at 1st level and one additional class power at 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, and 11th level. The rewards granted are determined by the warlock’s choice of path. When the warlock is created, select the character’s dark path from options listed below or talk with your Judge about the patrons available in his campaign setting.\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Tradition** | **Region** | **Description** |\n| Demonology | Auran Empire, Jutland | Diabolists who call on the demonic power of the Outer Darkness. |\n| Necromancy | Kemesh | Morbid practitioners of the forbidden craft of necromancy. |\n| Transmogrification | Rorn, Southern Argollë | Sculptors of flesh who create living horrors. |\n\n**Occultism:** Every warlock has studied the forbidden secrets of the occult. On a proficiency throw of 11+, he can name the popular titles and symbols of chthonic powers; identify the type of undead creature encountered; and otherwise recall information of interest to demonology and necromancy. (This class power counts as one rank of Knowledge (Occult) proficiency).\n\n###### Additional Class Powers\n\nWhen they advance in level, warlocks gain the following additional class powers:\n\n**Dark Path II (3rd level):** The warlock’s dark path grants him his second reward.\n\n**Dark Path III (5th level):** The warlock’s dark path grants him his third reward.\n\n**Minor Magical Research (5th level):** The warlock can research spells, scribe magical scrolls, and brew potions.\n\n**Dark Path IV (7th level):** The warlock’s dark path grants him his fourth reward.\n\n**Dark Path V (9th level:** The warlock’s dark path grants him his fifth reward.\n\n**Major Magical Research (9th level):** The warlock can create more powerful magic items such as weapons, rings, and staffs.\n\n**Sanctum (9th level):** By acquiring a **sanctum** (often a great tower) worth at least 15,000gp, the warlock can attract followers to his service. 1d6 apprentices of 1st – 3rd level plus 2d6 apprentices of 0th level arrive to serve him as followers within 1d3 months of him acquiring the sanctum. If the warlock already has a sanctum, the followers arrive to serve him within 1d3 months of him reaching 9th level. The apprentices function as assistants in magical research (see p. XXX). If performing magic research, the apprentices must be provided food and lodging, but need not be paid wages. (If asked to accompany the mage on adventure, the apprentices must be paid wages as henchmen.) If the warlock builds a **dungeon** beneath or near his sanctum, monsters will start to arrive to dwell within, often followed by adventurers seeking to fight them. Additional rules for **sanctums** are detailed in the **Campaigns** chapter (p. XX).\n\n**Dark Path VI (11th level):** The warlock’s dark path grants him his sixth reward.\n\n**Supreme Magical Research (11th level):** The warlock can learn and cast ritual arcane spells of great power (7th, 8th, and 9th level), craft magical constructs, and create magical cross-breeds. If chaotic, the warlock can create necromantic servants and become undead.\n\n###### Dark Paths\n\nDemonology\n\n**Conjure Dark Powers (1st level):** When the demonologist casts summoning spells (such as*conjure fiend*or *summon**shadows*), the spell effects are calculated as if he were two caster levels higher than his actual level of experience. (This makes them harder to dispel.) If the character loses his concentration due to taking damage while controlling a conjured creature, he must make a Spells saving throw. If the save succeeds, he maintains his concentration. His eligibility to conduct research on summoning magic is determined as if he were two caster levels higher than actual. He gains a +2 bonus on magic research throws and increases his research rate by 10% when researching summoning magic. Conjure Dark Powers can stack with the Mastery of Conjuration and Summoning proficiency, such that the character’s summoning spells and research are calculated as if he were three (rather than two) caster levels higher and he gains a +2 bonus on his Spells saving throw to maintain concentration.\n\n**Theology (3rd level):** The demonologist has become a cultist of the chthonic powers. He gains one rank of the Theology proficiency.\n\n**Conjure Hellion (5th level):** The demonologist has made pacts with demon lords. He can cast *conjure hellion*once per day.\n\n**Expanded Repertoire (7th level):**The demonologist gains an expanded repertoire, increasing the number of slots in his repertoire of each level that he can cast by one. He must learn the specific spells separately. The additional spells must be conjuration or summoning spells, learned either from studying existing spells or by magic research of new spells.\n\n**Words of Command and Obedience (9th):** The demonologistcan compel his conjured and summoned creatures to obey his inexorable will. Any creatures summoned by the demonologist will obey him to the best of their ability rather than seek to pervert his intention. Any creatures he conjures will depart without harming him if his concentration is broken.\n\n**Power of Sacrifice (11th level):** Bargaining with the infernal powers has taught the demonologist the power of sacrifice. He can gain arcane power by blood sacrifice, and counts any arcane power from blood sacrifice as double its gp value. He can store the arcane power from blood sacrifices indefinitely, even when not actively performing magical research. See the rules for Arcane Power (p. XX) and Blood Sacrifice (p. XX).\n\nNecromancy\n\n**Secrets of the Dark Arts (1st):** The necromancer can control undead as a Chaotic crusader of one half his class level. If the character casts death spells, his targets suffer a -2 penalty on their saving throws. When the character casts necromantic spells (such as *animate undead*), the spell effects are calculated as if he were two class levels higher than his actual level of experience. His eligibility to research death or necromancy magic is determined as if he were two caster levels higher than actual. He gains a +2 bonus on magic research throws and increases his research rate by 10% when researching death or necromancy magic. Secrets of the Dark Arts can stack with the Black Lore of Zahar proficiency, such that the character can control undead as a crusader of two-thirds his class level (rounded up), and his death and necromancy spells and research are calculated as if he were three (rather than two) caster levels higher than his actual caster level.\n\n**Mortuary Science (3rd):** The necromancer has undertaken a deep study of anatomy, circulation, disease, and vitality. He gains one rank of the Healing proficiency.\n\n**Speak with Dead (5th)***:* The dead hold no secrets for the necromancer. He can cast *speak with the dead*once per day.\n\n**Expanded Repertoire (7th level):**The necromancer gains an expanded repertoire, increasing the number of slots in his repertoire of each level that he can cast by one. He must learn the specific spells separately. The additional spells must be death and necromancy spells, learned either from studying existing spells or by magic research of new spells.\n\n**Lordship Over the Undead (9th)***:* In black tomes and evil liturgies, the necromancer has gained lordship over the undead. Whenever the character succeeds in controlling undead (whether from a roll or automatically from a “R” result), the undead are controlled for 1 day per level instead of the usual 1 turn per level. If the undead would have been controlled for 1 day per level (from a “D” result), the undead are instead controlled indefinitely.\n\n**Secrets of Life and Death (11th):** The necromancer has finally unlocked the secrets of life and death. He can perform necromancy at half the usual material cost and research cost.\n\nTransmogrification\n\n**Grotesque Arts of Transformation (1st):** When the character casts transmogrification spells, the spell effects are calculated as if he were two class levels higher than his actual level of experience. His eligibility to create crossbreeds or research transmogrification magic is determined as if he were two caster levels higher than actual. Targets of his transmogrification spells suffer a -2 penalty to their saving throw. He gains a +2 bonus on magic research throws and increases his research rate by 10% when creating crossbreeds or researching transmogrification magic. Grotesque Arts can stack with the Transmogrification proficiency, such that the character’s transmogrification spells are calculated as if he were three (rather than two) caster levels higher and his bonus to magic research and research rate is increased to +3 and 15%.\n\n**Alchemy (3rd level)**:To master the art of transmogrification one must unravel the secrets of alchemy. The character gains one rank of the Alchemy proficiency.\n\n**Skinchange (5th level)**: The transmogrifier has learned to transcend his own form. He can cast *skinchange*once per day.\n\n**Expanded Repertoire (7th level):**The transmogrifier gains an expanded repertoire, increasing the number of slots in his repertoire of each level that he can cast by one. He must learn the specific spells separately. The additional spells must be transmogrification spells, learned either from studying existing spells or by magic research of new spells.\n\n**Hideous Servant (9th level):** Experiments combining living creatures with the transmogrifier’s own flesh and blood have created a hideous servantintimately bonded to his will. The hideous servant is mechanically similar to a shaman’s totem animal (see p. XX).However, the sorcerer selects two of his hideous servant’s characteristics (AC, movement, attack routine, and special abilities) from one animal and two characteristics from another, while the servant’s base Hit Dice are set to the average of the two animals selected. (Remember that actual HD will be adjusted by the character’s level.) He does not gain a totem benefit.\n\n**Shape Flesh and Bone (11th level):** The transmogrifier can mold flesh and bone like clay. The character is able to create magical crossbreeds at half the usual material cost and research cost.\n\n###### Corrupting Weaknesses\n\nThough it grants them great power, the dark path tread by the warlock carries a terrible cost. At 1st level, and again at 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, and 11th level, the warlock is afflicted by a **corrupting weakness.** The Judge can pick from the list below or ask the player to roll 1d10:\n\n1. **Disfigured:** Sorcerous studies have begun to make the warlock a monstrous figure, leaving him misshapen limbs, clawed hands or feet, hideous scarring, strangely colored eyes, and so on. Each disfigurement imposes a -2 penalty to reaction rolls with sapient creatures of Lawful or Neutral alignment.\n2. **Distrusted**: Lore best left unstudied has twisted the warlock’s demeanor and personality. A reaction roll with sapient creatures of Lawful or Neutral alignment can never achieve a friendly (12+) result. Each time this weakness is selected thereafter, reduce the best possible reaction roll by one further step.\n3. **Enervated**: The warlock’s exploration of sinister sorcery has sapped his soul of strength and vigor. His Constitution is reduced by 2 points each time this weakness occurs.\n4. **Frightening to Beasts:** The warlock’s corruption is unsettling to animals. They growl, hiss, rear up, and otherwise make their displeasure known whenever he is within 10’. The warlock suffers a -4 reaction roll when encountering animals or giant animals. He cannot ride normal mounts. Characters with Beast Friendship proficiency (or related class powers) can detect something is unnatural about the warlock, but do not suffer a reaction roll penalty. If the warlock himself had Beast Friendship proficiency, the proficiency’s effects now only help when dealing with wild predators and scavengers, such as wolves and vultures (in which cases the above penalty will not apply).\n5. **Haunted:** Whispers from the beyond plague the warlock. They are difficult to ignore, and impose a -2 penalty to listening throws and -1 penalty to initiative and surprise rolls. The penalty is cumulative each time this weakness occurs.\n6. **Mad:** So disturbing are the warlock’s dark secrets that he has begun to lose his grip on reality. Each day he must make a Spells saving throw or go **mad** for 1 – 10 hours. The warlock’s first saving throw against madness is at +20, but each consecutive saving throw is one point less advantaged. When the warlock goes mad, he falls under the Judge’s control for 1d10 hours, during which time his behavior is entirely unpredictable. The day after a bout of madness, the warlock resumes his saving throws with a +20 bonus.\n7. **Mutated:** The corrupting influences of dark magic have begun to warp the warlock’s body. The first time this weakness occurs, roll 1d10 on the Magical Mutations sub-table (p. XX). The second time it occurs, roll 1d10+1. The third time it occurs, roll 1d10+2, and so on.\n8. **Nocturnal:** Creatures of darkness and evil hunt by night, and sleep by day. So too does the warlock. He cannot regain spells unless he sleeps during the day. Due to his nocturnal habits, he suffers a penalty of -2 to all throws when in sunlight. This penalty is increased by an additional 2 points each time this weakness occurs.\n9. **Obsessed:** The warlock’s self-control and will begin to erode in the face of ongoing corruption. His Will is reduced by 2 points each time this weakness occurs.\n10. **Sleepless:** Haunted by nightmares and disturbing visions of the grave, the warlock finds it hard to sleep. Each time he attempts to rest, he must roll 1d6. On a 1, the warlock tosses and turns all night, regaining no hit points and recovering no spells.

The bonus proficiency and bonus spell that each template begins with are noted last. For characters with INT of less than 13 or greater than 15, see the **Intellect Scores of Arcane Spellcasters** section earlier in this Chapter.\n\n### Witch\n\nKey Attribute: INT and WIL\n\nRequirements: None\n\nHit Dice: 1d4\n\nMaximum Level: 14\n\nThe ignorant will often refer to any female spellcaster as a witch. Actual witches, however, are women who practice a distinct craft of magic. Like priestesses and shamans, witches invoke divine magic, but they do not organize into communities of faith nor do they dedicate themselves to the service of their gods or goddesses. Rather, they seek to gain personal knowledge and strength by bartering with the old powers of the world. Through ancient pacts, forgotten prayers, secret names of power, and other means, they appease, bargain, coerce, convince, and harness divine power to their own ends. Their quest for knowledge and power often drives witches to become adventurers.\n\nWithin the Auran Empire, witches are viewed with deep suspicion by the Empyrean priests, but many rural villages nevertheless have a wise woman with some skill in witchcraft. Witches are fairly common in Southern Argollë, Jutland, Rorn, Kemesh, and the Ivory Kingdoms, each of which has flourishing traditions of witchcraft.\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Witch Level Progression** | | | | **Witch Spell Progression** | | | | | | |\n| **Experience** | **Title** | **Level** | **Hit Dice** |  | **1** | **2** | **3** | **4** | **5** | **6** |\n| 0 | Initiate | 1 | 1d4 |  | 2 | - | - | - | - | - |\n| 2,000 | Seeress | 2 | 2d4 |  | 3 | - | - | - | - | - |\n| 4,000 | Siren | 3 | 3d4 |  | 3 | 2 | - | - | - | - |\n| 8,000 | Pythoness | 4 | 4d4 |  | 3 | 3 | - | - | - | - |\n| 16,000 | Sibyl | 5 | 5d4 |  | 3 | 3 | 2 | - | - | - |\n| 32,000 | Enchantress | 6 | 6d4 |  | 3 | 3 | 3 | - | - | - |\n| 65,000 | Sorceress | 7 | 7d4 |  | 5 | 3 | 3 | 2 | - | - |\n| 130,000 | Incantrix | 8 | 8d4 |  | 5 | 5 | 3 | 3 | - | - |\n| 230,000 | Witch | 9 | 9d4 |  | 5 | 5 | 5 | 3 | 2 | - |\n| 330,000 | Witch, 10th level | 10\\* | 9d4 + 1 |  | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 3 | - |\n| 430,000 | Witch, 11th level | 11\\* | 9d4 + 2 |  | 6 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 3 | 2 |\n| 530,000 | Witch, 12th level | 12\\* | 9d4 + 3 |  | 6 | 6 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 3 |\n| 630,000 | Witch, 13th level | 13\\* | 9d4 + 4 |  | 6 | 6 | 6 | 5 | 5 | 3 |\n| 730,000 | Witch Queen | 14\\* | 9d4 + 5 |  | 6 | 6 | 6 | 6 | 5 | 5 |\n| \\*No adjustment from Constitution applies to this flat bonus. | | | | | | | | | | |\n\n###### Combat Characteristics\n\nWitches are devoted to their craft and receive little combat training.\n\n**Combat Proficiencies:** Witches have weapon proficiency with clubs, daggers, darts, and staffs. They have no proficiency with armor. They have fighting style proficiency with the two-handed weapon style (allowing them to use a staff with both hands), but not with the dual weapon or weaponand shield styles.\n\n**Combat Progression:** Witches advance in attack throws only two points every six levels of experience (i.e. the same as mages), but they advance in saving throws by two points every fourlevels of experience (i.e. as crusaders). They do not gain any bonus to damage as they advance in level. They cannot cleave, regardless of their level.\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Witch Saving Throws** | | | | | |\n| **Level** | **Paralysis** | **Death** | **Blast** | **Implements** | **Spells** |\n| 1 – 2 | 13+ | 10+ | 16+ | 13+ | 15+ |\n| 3 – 4 | 12+ | 9+ | 15+ | 12+ | 14+ |\n| 5 – 6 | 11+ | 8+ | 14+ | 11+ | 13+ |\n| 7 – 8 | 10+ | 7+ | 13+ | 10+ | 12+ |\n| 9 – 10 | 9+ | 6+ | 12+ | 9+ | 11+ |\n| 11 – 12 | 8+ | 5+ | 11+ | 8+ | 10+ |\n| 13 – 14 | 7+ | 4+ | 10+ | 7+ | 9+ |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Witch Attack Throws** | |\n| **Level** | **Attack Throw** |\n| 1 – 3 | 10+ |\n| 4 – 6 | 9+ |\n| 7 – 9 | 8+ |\n| 10 – 12 | 7+ |\n| 13 – 14 | 6+ |\n\n###### Starting Class Powers\n\nAt the start of play, witches have the following class powers.\n\n**Studious Divine Magic:** By reminding the gods of ancient pacts and coercing them with forgotten prayers and binding hymns, witches can cast divine spells. Unlike most other divine casters, who receive their spells from prayer, witches receive their spells from study. Witches follow the same spell progression and use the same rules for learning and casting spells as mages. They record their repertoires of spells in spell books and can learn new spells from scribing scrolls or studying other divine spell books. They select their spells from the divine spell list, rather than the arcane spell list, however, and cannot learn or cast spells found in arcane spell books. See p. XX for more details on studious divine spellcasting.\n\n**Tradition:** Every witch belongs to a **tradition**, which defines her approach to the magic and her relationship with the gods and spirits that are her source of power. The regions within the Auran Empire campaign setting associated with each tradition are noted below. Judges can create other traditions for their own campaign settings where necessary.\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Tradition** | **Region** | **Description** |\n| Antiquarian | Auran Empire, Jutland, Ivory Kingdom | Wise women who focus on healing and beneficial potions, they practice their traditional craft wherever rural human settlements may be found. |\n| Chthonic | Kemesh, Ivory Kingdom | Malefic practitioners who consort with the darkest of powers, reveling in the seduction and corruption of the innocent. |\n| Sylvan | Rorn, Southern Argollë | Reclusive witches who travel the borderlands between human settlements and fey forests. |\n\nShe can acquire congregants through proselytizing. She can automatically identify religious symbols, spell signatures, trappings, and holy days of her own tradition, and can recognize those of other faiths with a proficiency throw of 11+. Rare or occult cults might be harder to recognize. (This class power counts as one rank of Theology proficiency). In addition, each tradition grants a special ability at 1st, 3rd, 5th, and 7th level.\n\n**Village Wisdom (1st level):** All witches can perform minor acts of “hedge magic” useful in village life, such as alleviating cold symptoms, easing the pains of childbirth, driving away bedbugs from a mattress, removing mites and ticks from a creature, and so on. Each use takes 1 turn (10 minutes). (If your Judge is using the optional rules for cantrips from *Axioms,* this class power grants the witch the ability to learn and cast divine cantrips instead.)\n\n###### Additional Class Powers\n\nWhen they advance in level, witches gain the following additional class powers:\n\n**Brew Potions (3rd level):** The witch can brew potions. However, she cannot yet research new spells or scribe scrolls.\n\n**Minor Magical Research (5th level):** The witch can research new spells. However, she cannot yet scribe scrolls.\n\n**Scribe Scrolls (7th level):** The witch can create magic scrolls.\n\n**Witch’s Cottage (9th level:** By acquiring a cottage worth at least 15,000gp, the witch can attract followers to her service. 1d6 apprentices of 1st – 3rd level plus 2d6 apprentices of 0th level arrive to serve her as followers within 1d3 months of her acquiring the cottage. If the witch already has a cottage, the followers arrive to serve her within 1d3 months of her reaching 9th level. The apprentices function as assistants in magical research (see p. XXX). If performing magic research, the apprentices must be provided food and lodging, but need not be paid wages. (If asked to accompany the witch on adventure, the apprentices must be paid wages as henchmen.) A normal woman in training typically takes 2 years to become a 1st level witch. Additional rules for witch’s cottages are detailed in the **Campaigns** chapter.\n\n**Major Magical Research (9th level):** The witch can create more powerful magic items such as weapons, rings, and staffs.\n\n**Supreme Magical Research (11th level):** The witch can learn and cast ritual divine spells of great power (7th, 8th, and 9th level) and craft magical constructs. If chaotic, the witch can create necromantic servants and become undead. Rules for magic research can be found in the **Campaigns** chapter (p. XX).\n\n###### Traditions\n\nAntiquarian Witch\n\n**Traditional Medicine (1st level):** The antiquarian witch practices an ancient tradition of natural medicine using healing herbs. She can identify and forage for healing herbs as if she had one rank of Naturalism proficiency. (If she already has Naturalism, she gains a +4 bonus on proficiency throws to identify and forage for healing herbs.) She can use healing herbs as if she had Healing proficiency. Given one turn (10 minutes), she can combine a pound of healing herbs with an equal gp of special components to create potent healing herbs that increase their effect by +1. The witch needs a cauldron over a fire or a kitchen to make potent healing herbs. The potent herbs lose all efficacy after 24 hours.\n\nEXAMPLE: Bronwyn is an antiquarian witch. She has one pound of comfrey (10gp value), one pound of woundwort (10gp), and two marsh ghoul livers (10gp each). When her party camps for the night, she uses her Natural Medicine power. First, she mixes comfrey with ghoul liver to create potent comfrey that heals 1d3+1 damage. Then she mixes woundwort with ghoul liver to create potent woundwort that grants a +3 bonus to Healing throws. However, the herbs will lose their efficacy if not used within the next day.\n\n**Healing Arts (3rd level):** The antiquarian witch’s knowledge of the healing arts deepens. She gains one rank of Healing proficiency. (If she already has three ranks of Healing proficiency, she can gain a rank of Alchemy or Naturalism instead.)\n\n**Second Sight (5th level):** Because of the antiquarian witch’s connection with the hidden world, she can see innately or magically invisible creatures within 60’. Invisible creatures are aware that the witch can see them, and might take a particular interest in her as a result. Second Sight does not provide the ability to see creatures or features hidden through cover or darkness.\n\n**Magic Mirror (7th level):** By directing her gaze onto a mirror, crystal, reflective pool, or other surface upon which the images can be displayed, the antiquarian witch can see visions of faraway people and places. She can cast *scry* (as the spell) once per day. Each use takes 1 turn (10 minutes). If the witch has *clairaudiency*or *telepathy*in her repertoire, she can cast either spell at the same time in order to use one of those spells while scrying.\n\nChthonic Witch\n\n**Bedazzling Glamour (1st level)**: Vain and narcissistic, the chthonic witch has learned how to use magical glamour to conceal her imperfections. While active, the glamour grants her three benefits:\n\n* The witch gains a +1 bonus to all reaction rolls. This bonus does not stack with Mystic Aura (though the other effects do).\n* The witch does not suffer any age-related penalty to CHA.\n* Permanent wounds or side effects that otherwise would cause a penalty to her reaction rolls are ignored.\n\nActivating her glamour demands one turn (10 minutes) of concentration by the witch. Once activated, the glamour remains active until she ends it, is subject to a **dispel** effect, or is incapacitated. While the glamour is active, the witch radiates magic.\n\n**Decadent Arts (3rd level):** The chthonic witch is a practiced seductress. She gains the Seduction proficiency. (If she already has Seduction, she can select Diplomacy or Intimidation instead.)\n\n**Subtle Beguilement (5th level):** With subtle words of praise and disdain, the chthonic witch can beguile the weak-willed. When casting enchantment spells, the witch counts as having the Quiet Magic proficiency. If she already has Quiet Magic proficiency, she can cast enchantment spells using subvocalized words and no hand gestures. In either case, targets of her enchantment spells suffer a -2 penalty to their saving throw, or a -3 penalty if she also has Mastery of Enchantment & Illusions proficiency.\n\n**Evil Eye (7th level):** The chthonic witch can hex a foe with the merest glance. She can *bestow curse* as a spell-like ability once per week. Because her Evil Eye is a spell-like ability and not a spell, she does not need to declare she is casting it before initiative, nor does taking damage or failing a saving throw prior to her initiative segment prevent her from using it.\n\nSylvan Witch\n\n**Friend of Birds and Beasts (1st level):** From long years in the company of wild and fey things, the sylvan witch has gained the friendship of birds and beasts. She can identify plants and fauna with a proficiency throw of 11+. She can understand the vocalizations and body language of birds and beasts, enabling her to understand any simple messages the animals might be communicating (such as “danger is nearby, be alert,” “you’re unfamiliar and strange,” or “do not come closer, we are guarding our den!”). Because of her innate understanding of the language of beasts, the witch also counts as proficient for purposes of handling trained animals in their roles such as droving or shepherding. She gains +2 to all reaction rolls when encountering normal animals and can take animals as henchmen. She can train and handle animal henchmen to perform tricks or serve a particular role without having to separately possess Animal Training. If the witch also has the Beast Friendship proficiency, she can identify plants and fauna with a throw of 7+ and can take one more henchman than her Charisma would otherwise permit, as long as at least one is an animal. (The bonus to reaction rolls does not increase.)\n\n**Natural Arts (3rd level)**: The sylvan witch knows the secrets of the woodlands. She gains the Naturalism proficiency. (If she already has Naturalism, she can take a second rank or select Alchemy or Healing instead.)\n\n**Close Friend of Birds and Beasts (5th level):** The sylvan witch’s friendship with birds and beasts improves. She can *speak with beasts* (as the spell) at will. If she ever rolls Friendly reactions while speaking with small, cute animals such as songbirds, squirrels, and rabbits, the animals act as if *bewitched* in her presence.\n\n**Enchanted Forest (7th level)**: The woodland home of a sylvan witch becomes a strange and magical place. She gains the power to cast *forest enchantment*(as the spell) once per week. Each use takes 1 turn (10 minutes). The sylvan witch can sustain a number of *forest enchantments* equal to her caster level, enabling her to enchant a vast swathe of territory (approximately 2 acres per level).\n\n###### Code of Behavior\n\nWhen a young woman first undertakes the study of witchcraft, she often believes she has discovered a path to freedom and power denied to others of her age and sex. And this is true – at first. A young witch only needs to interact with weak and enfeebled spiritual entities in order to cast her spells, and these beings she can dominate through sheer charisma and will. But as she begins to learn and cast more powerful spells, the witch must interact with increasingly powerful and ancient powers. These beings cannot be cajoled or coerced; they must be bargained with. Over time, the witch accumulates an increasing number of **obligations** to these beings, obligations that restrict her behavior as much as any priestess’s strictures.\n\nA witch starts with one simple obligationat 1st level and gains an additional obligation each time she gains the ability to cast another level of spells. The obligations become increasingly severe at higher levels, with the exact nature of the obligations determined by the Judge based on the witch’s alignment, tradition, and spell repertoire. The following obligations would be suitable for an antiquarian witch of Lawful or Neutral alignment:\n\n* 1st level: The witch must light a candle and pray over it for one turn (10 minutes) at noon and midnight.\n* 3rd level: The witch cannot lie. She can equivocate, prevaricate, speak in riddles, or stay silent, however.\n* 5th level: If the witch unjustly wrongs another human or demi-human, she must redress the wrong at threefold its value.\n* 7th level: If the witch accepts a gift, she must offer a gift of threefold value to the gift giver.\n* 9th level: If the witch suffers a personal wrong, she must exact retribution of threefold value from the one who wronged her.\n* 11th level: The witch’s soul is sworn to service after death. She cannot be restored to life by any means short of a *wish* or *miracle*.\n\nIf a witch fails to uphold her obligations, the powers she is obligated to will certainly extract punishment. These penalties are entirely up to the Judge and might include curses, reductions in spells available, or even loss of some or all class powers entirely. To remove the penalties, the witch will have to atone for her violation by, e.g., sacrificing treasure, undertaking quests, or even receiving an **atonement** spell from a powerful caster of her order (Judge’s discretion).\n\n###### Class Proficiencies\n\n**Proficiency Progression:** At 1st level, witches select one class proficiency from their class proficiency list and one general proficiency from the general proficiency list. They select an additional class proficiency at 4th, 8th, and 12th level. They select an additional general proficiency at 5th, 9th, and 13th level.\n\n**Witch Proficiency List:** Alchemy, Arcane Dabbling, Beast Friendship, Black Lore of Zahar, Contemplation, Divine Blessing, Divine Health, Elementalism, Elven Bloodline, Expanded Repertoire, Familiar, Illusion Resistance, Laying on Hands, Loremastery, Magical Engineering, Magical Music, Mastery of Enchantments & Illusions, Mystic Aura, Naturalism, Passing without Trace, Poisoning, Prestidigitation, Prophecy, Quiet Magic, Sensing Power, Soothsaying, Transmogrification, Unflappable Casting\n\n###### Witch Templates\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **3d6 Roll** | **Template** | **Proficiencies** | **Starting Equipment** |\n| 3-4 | Crone  (Antiquarian) | Familiar  Intimidation | *Black cat familiar*, tattered prayer book with *sling stone* and *frighten beast*, gnarled oak staff, tattered cloak, patched wool dress, frayed leather belt, scuffed high boots, backpack, tinderbox, 5 musty tallow candles, 6 torches, waterskin, 1 week’s iron rations, 11gp (4 5/6 st) |\n| 5-6 | Witch of the Woods  (Sylvan) | Passing without Trace  Survival | Leather-bound prayer book with *call of the wolf* and *locate animal or plant,* holy symbol (oak tree), slender whitewood staff, bark-colored wool cloak, leaf-green wool dress, leather belt, high boots, backpack, tinderbox, 6 torches, waterskin, 1 week’s iron rations, 7gp (4 1/6 st) |\n| 7-8 | Dark Oracle  (Chthonic) | Prophecy  Knowledge (astrology) | Bloodstained prayer book with *bane-rune* and *tenebrosity,* unholy symbol (purple circle on black), polished blackwood staff, purple and black linen chiton, embossed belt, high strappy sandals, backpack, tinderbox, 5 black tallow candles, 1 purple wax candle, 12 torches, flask of unholy water, waterskin, 1 week’s iron rations, 1gp (6 3/6 st) |\n| 9-10 | Village Witch  (Antiquarian) | Laying on Hands  Healing | Handed-down prayer book with *cure light injury* and *purify food and water,* holy symbol (pair of horns around lunar disc), slender oak staff, wool freeholder’s dress, embossed belt, high boots, backpack, 1 lb birthwort, 1 lb comfrey, 1 lb goldenrod, 1 lb woundwort, tinderbox, 3 scented wax candles, 12 torches, waterskin, 1 week’s iron rations, 5gp (6 2/6 st) |\n| 11-12 | Lorelei  (Sylvan) | Magical Music  Performance (singing) | Bark-bound prayer book with *remove fear* and *angelic choir,* holy symbol (white bird), slender whitewood staff, elaborate bronze choker necklace (20gp value), elegant leaf-green dress, autumn-hued silk sash, low boots, backpack, tinderbox, 2 tallow candles, flask of holy water, waterskin, 1 week’s iron rations, 6gp (3 4/6 st) |\n| 13-14 | Death Mistress  (Chthonic) | Black Lore of Zahar  Knowledge (occult) | Flesh-bound prayer book with *unliving puppet* and *allure,* unholy symbol (medusa’s head), stiletto, black leather cloak and long gloves, black silk veil and sash, black linen chiton, high leather boots, silver bangles (20gp value), silver earrings (20gp), backpack, tinderbox, 6 black tallow candles, waterskin, 1 week’s iron rations, 28gp (3 2/6 st) |\n| 15-16 | Wise Woman  (Antiquarian) | Loremastery  Knowledge (history) | Ancient prayer book with *counterspell* and *predict weather,* holy symbol (pair of horns around lunar disc), gnarled oak staff, sturdy wool cloak, well-made wool dress, low boots, backpack, belt pouch, tinderbox, lantern, 3 flasks of common oil, 1 lb birthwort, 1 lb comfrey, 1 lb goldenrod, 1 lb woundwart, flask of holy water, waterskin, 1 week’s iron rations, 22gp (4 5/6 st) |\n| 17-18 | Faerie Princess  (Sylvan) | Elven Bloodline  Riding | Flowery prayer book with *word of command* and *holy circle,* holy symbol (flower garland), slender whitewood staff, gossamer head dress (15gp value), elegant white linen dress, colorful silk sash, high boots, tinderbox, 6 wood-scented tallow candles, light riding horse, riding tack and saddle, saddlebag, waterskin, 1 week’s iron rations, 3gp (enc. 3 st with rations on horse) |\n\n**Notes:** The death mistress’s stiletto is a type of dagger.
