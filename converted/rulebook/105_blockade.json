To blockade a besieged stronghold, the besieging army must encircle the area around the besieged stronghold with troops, ships, or fortifications. Once a blockade is in place, the besieged stronghold is cut off from its supply lines.</p>\n<p>If a besieging army has the luxury of time and resources, a blockade may be all that’s required to win the siege. Within a few months, the defending garrison will run out of supplies and be forced to surrender or starve. Most besiegers have supply concerns of their own, however, and cannot afford to wait a season or more for a recalcitrant city or fortress to surrender.</p>\n<h3>Blockading with Units</h3>\n<p>The number of units required to blockade a stronghold is equal to twice the unit capacity of the stronghold, with a minimum of 20 units required. The units can be infantry units of 120 troops or cavalry units of 60 troops. (Even though cavalry units only consist of 60 troops, they are able to patrol as well as 120 infantry troops because of their greater mobility and scouting ability.) Units cannot be assigned to construction projects if they are being used to blockade.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: Marcus wishes to blockade Moruvai’s stronghold with his troops. Moruvai’s stronghold has a unit capacity of 24, so it will require 48 units to blockade the stronghold. Marcus’s army has 50 units (6,000 troops). He assigns 48 units to blockade the stronghold. He has only 2 units remaining for construction projects or other purposes.</p>\n<h3>Blockading with Ships</h3>\n<p>Strongholds built on navigable waterways will be able to re-supply along the waterway if it is not blocked. The besieging army must have a sufficient number of ships to blockade the waterway. To function in a naval blockade, a ship must have a ram, an artillery piece, or at least 20 marines on board.</p>\n<p>Blockading a stronghold surrounded by waterways on all sides (such as an island) requires one ship for each 2 points of unit capacity. If the stronghold faces water for only a portion of its perimeter, multiply the stronghold’s unit capacity by the percentage of the stronghold’s perimeter which faces the waterway.</p>\n<p>The besieging army does nothave to blockade the portion of the walls blockaded by ship. It must still blockade any remaining walls facing land.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: Baal the Terrible has laid siege to Aura. Aura is an enormous city with a unit capacity of 300. Aura is a harbor city on a peninsula, and 70% of Aura’s walls touch the sea. Therefore (300 x 0.70 / 2) 105 ships are required to blockade Aura’s sea walls. 90 units (300 x 0.30) are still necessary to blockade the land walls of Aura.</p>\n<p>If the besieged stronghold is protected by a navy of its own, the number of ships required to blockade the stronghold is increased by the size of the stronghold’s navy.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: If a fleet of 25 ships protects Aura, Baal the Terrible will need (105 + 25) 130 ships to blockade Aura.</p>\n<h3>Blockading with Fortifications (Circumvallation)</h3>\n<p>Given sufficient time, the besieging army may encircle the besieged stronghold with a line of fortifications built outside of bow-shot of the stronghold’s walls, known as a <strong>circumvallation</strong>. A circumvallation consists of a mix of wooden palisades (8’ high x 1” thick), trenches (10’ wide x 5’ deep), and earthen ramparts (8’ high x 1’ thick). Circumvallations cost 100gp per 100’ length.</p>\n<p>Construction of a circumvallation is usually divided into several <strong>construction projects</strong> at <strong>construction sites</strong> around the besieged stronghold. As a guideline, each project should encompass at least 2,500’ (about half a mile) of circumvallation. The workers on the circumvallation projects are usually unskilled labor drawn from the besieging army, but craftsmen may be used if available. Construction of circumvallations can also be assisted with <em>earth’s movement</em>. See Chapter 4, <strong>Construction Projects</strong> (p. XX – XX).</p>\n<p>Each 250’ length of circumvallation reduces the number of units required to maintain the blockade by 2 (e.g. 250’ is required per point of unit capacity). If the circumvallation reduces the number of units required for the blockade to 0, it completely encircles the stronghold. A complete circumvallation imposes a -4 penalty on attempts to smuggle supplies into the stronghold.</p>\n<p>Circumvallations cannot blockade access to waterways. Ships must be used to blockade navigable waterways.</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: Marcus’s army has laid siege to Moruvai’s stronghold (unit capacity 24). He wants to erect a circumvallation that will entirely encircle the stronghold. Therefore the circumvallation must be (24 x 250’) 6,000’ around. The circumvallation’s construction cost will be 6,250gp.</p>\n<p>Marcus has 6,000 troops. Marcus splits the circumvallation into 2 construction projects, each consisting of 3,000’ of circumvallation. 3,000 troops are assigned to work on each project. Each project has a construction rate of (3,000 x 0.1gp/day) 300gp per day, so it will take (3,000 / 300) 10 days to complete each circumvallation. When the circumvallations are complete, the stronghold will be blockaded, and the troops can be used for other purposes.</p>\n<h3>Effects of a Blockade</h3>\n<p>As soon as a blockade is in place, the defending army loses access to its supply line. It is thereafter restricted to paying its supply cost from the actual value of supplies already in the besieged stronghold, or from supplies smuggled into the stronghold. A blockaded stronghold is very vulnerable to having its supplies destroyed by sabotage.</p>\n<p><strong>Stored Supplies:</strong> Strongholds usually have a larder and pantry provisioned for siege. By default, the value of supplies stored in a besieged stronghold will be 600gp per point of unit capacity, enough for 10 weeks if garrisoned at full capacity. Gold and other liquid wealth held by the ruler does notcount towards the value of supplies!</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: Moruvai is blockaded in his stronghold by Marcus’s army. Moruvai has 10 infantry units in his castle. His army requires (10 x 60) 600gp in supplies each week. Moruvai’s stronghold has a unit capacity of 24 units, so the stronghold has (24 x 600gp) 14,400gp in supplies stored up. The castle therefore has sufficient supplies to maintain the defending army for (14,400gp / 600) 24 weeks.</p>\n<p>If the stronghold is not blockaded immediately, the defending army will be able to gather far more supplies. Increase the value of supplies stored in the stronghold by 600gp per point of unit capacity for each week of preparation time available to the defending army. A stronghold cannot hold more than 3,000gp of supplies per point of unit capacity (1 year’s supplies).</p>\n<p>EXAMPLE: If it took Marcus two weeks to blockade Moruvai’s stronghold, then Moruvai would have time to gather an additional (24 x 600gp/week x 2 weeks) 28,800gp worth of supplies.</p>\n<p><strong>Loss of Supplies:</strong> If and when supplies become exhausted, the defending troops suffer all of the normal consequences from loss of supply. Each week troops are partially or completely unsupplied also counts as a calamity, and triggers a loyalty roll. Few sieges last long once the defender’s supplies are exhausted! See Chapter 10, <strong>Supplying Armies</strong> (p. XX), for additional information on supply.</p>\n<h3>Hijinks During Blockade</h3>\n<p>Either or both armies may resort tohijinks during the course of a blockade. See Chapter 10, <strong>Spying and Other Hijinks</strong> (p. XX) for additional information on hijinks.</p>\n<p><strong>Smuggling:</strong> A defending army leader with access to perpetrators can order his perpetrators to attempt smuggling hijinks to re-supply his stronghold. For smuggling to succeed, the perpetrator must make a successful Move Silently throw. The proficiency throw is penalized by the besieging leader’s strategic ability. If a circumvallation completely encircles the stronghold, the proficiency throw suffers an additional -4 penalty. If the throw is successful, the perpetrator smuggles 1,000gp of supplies in per class level (representing a mix of grains, beer, preserved meat, salt, onions, etc.). The perpetrator can smuggle extra supplies by taking a -1 penalty on the proficiency throw per 1,000gp.</p>\n<p><strong>Sabotage</strong>: A besieging army leader with access to perpetrators inside the besieged stronghold (infiltrated perpetrators) can order his perpetrators to attempt sabotagehijinks against the defending army’s supplies. For sabotage to succeed, the perpetrator must make a successful Move Silently throw. The proficiency throw is modified by the opposing army’s leader’s strategic ability (as skilled generals tend to be better at guarding their stored supplies). If the throw is successful, the perpetrator destroys 1,000gp of supplies per class level. The perpetrator can destroy extra supplies by taking a -1 penalty on the proficiency throw per 1,000gp.</p>\n",
