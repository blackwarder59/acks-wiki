The exact time required for followers to arrive is listed in each class’s description.</p>\n<p>The Judge must generate the followers that arrive to serve an adventurer. Followers consist of apprentices (always 0th level), companions (always 1st – 3rd level) and military troops (either 0th or 1st level). Apprentices and companions can be generated using the class creation rules, rolling for a pre-generated template for each follower. Roll 1d6 for each companion to determine their level. On 1-3, 1st level; on 4-5, 2nd level; on 6, 3rd. Apprentices and companions function as henchmen for all purposes (including domain vassalage) but do not take up henchmen slots.</p>\n<p>Troops consist of a mix of types that varies by the class of the character they serve. For every platoon (30 troops) or fraction thereof, the Judge must roll on the Followers Type and Equipment by Class table to determine the arms and equipment of the arriving troops. Military followers function like mercenaries, except that they will follow the adventurer on adventurers.</p>\n<p>Followers have better morale and loyalty than ordinary hirelings. A crusader or bladedancer’s followers are fanatically brave and zealously faithful. Their morale and loyalty scores start at +4. Crusader and bladedancer followers do not have to make loyalty rolls when suffering calamities, but still have to make morale rolls. All other classes attract followers with loyalty scores starting at +2 and morale scores based on class, level, and equipment +1.</p>\n<p>An adventurer who attracts followers will also attract peasants to his domain, if he has established one.

  "rawMarkdown": "## Followers and Strongholds\n\nUpon reaching 9th level, an adventurer can begin to attract followers by buying, building, conquering, or receiving a stronghold of a minimum value (5,000gp to 15,000gp, depending on type). The type of stronghold and the number and type of followers attracted are defined by the character’s class. Some strongholds can be used to secure domains (p. XX) while others can be used to establish crime syndicates (p. XX). The Followers by Class table summarizes the different possibilities.\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Class | Stronghold | Followers Gained | Special Rules |\n| Assassin | Hideout  5,000gp | 2d6 1st level assassins | See Hideouts and Hijinks section (p. xx  Cannot use hideout to secure a domain |\n| Barbarian | Chieftain’s Hall  15,000gp | 5d6 x 10 0th level troops  1d6 1st – 3rd level barbarians | See clanholds (p.

XX) |\n\nThe character’s followers will begin arriving when the stronghold is built or, if the character already has a stronghold, when the character reaches 9th level. The exact time required for followers to arrive is listed in each class’s description.\n\nThe Judge must generate the followers that arrive to serve an adventurer. Followers consist of apprentices (always 0th level), companions (always 1st – 3rd level) and military troops (either 0th or 1st level). Apprentices and companions can be generated using the class creation rules, rolling for a pre-generated template for each follower. Roll 1d6 for each companion to determine their level. On 1-3, 1st level; on 4-5, 2nd level; on 6, 3rd. Apprentices and companions function as henchmen for all purposes (including domain vassalage) but do not take up henchmen slots.\n\nTroops consist of a mix of types that varies by the class of the character they serve. For every platoon (30 troops) or fraction thereof, the Judge must roll on the Followers Type and Equipment by Class table to determine the arms and equipment of the arriving troops. Military followers function like mercenaries, except that they will follow the adventurer on adventurers.\n\nFollowers have better morale and loyalty than ordinary hirelings. A crusader or bladedancer’s followers are fanatically brave and zealously faithful. Their morale and loyalty scores start at +4. Crusader and bladedancer followers do not have to make loyalty rolls when suffering calamities, but still have to make morale rolls. All other classes attract followers with loyalty scores starting at +2 and morale scores based on class, level, and equipment +1.\n\nAn adventurer who attracts followers will also attract peasants to his domain, if he has established one. This is discussed in the Attracting Peasants section of the domain rules (p. XX).\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Follower Type and Equipment by Class** | |\n| **Die Roll (1d100)** | **Type and Equipment** |\n| ***Barbarians (Jutland)*** | |\n| 01-25 | Bowmen (short bow, hand
