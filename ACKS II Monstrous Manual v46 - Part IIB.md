### Maggot, Murder

These carnivorous horrors are disgusting to behold. Their inch-long segmented cylindrical bodies, adorned all over with tiny bristling setae, are the color of white bone and yellow pus. Their fleshy heads terminate in hook-like mandibles that remorselessly scythe everything in their path. Unfortunately for adventurers, that’s almost exactly what ordinary maggots look like, too. Only a successful Naturalism proficiency throw at -4 can identify murder maggots as anything other than the common sort of disgusting grubs that just eat rotting meat and grow into flies.

###### Combat

Broods of murder maggots often lurk in corpses, piles of animal waste, rotten vegetation, and similar objects or areas. They are always **hidden**. A creature using a 10’ pole that makes a successful Searching throw can safely reveal the maggots’ presence in an object or area, but any creature that touches or searches an infested object or area without such precautions automatically triggers an attack by the brood.

The maggots immediately fling themselves at any living creatures within 5’ of the infested object or area. Divide the maggots evenly across the available targets. Each creature targeted must make a Blast saving throw with a penalty equal to the number of maggots targeting it. If the save succeeds, the target creature stomps, swats, or otherwise kills all the maggots before they can burrow into its body. If the save fails, then the target creature fails to kill some of the maggots – for each 3 points by which it failed the save, one maggot burrows into a bodily orifice (round up). The victim immediately takes 1 necrotic damage per maggot.

Once murder maggots have begun burrowing into the body, the victim has just a few minutes (2d4 rounds) before they are too deep for easy excision. Each round, the victim and/or one ally can cauterize or excise one maggot as a full-round action. Cauterizing deals 1d4 {F} damage to the victim. Excising deals 1d6 {S} damage, but the damage is reduced by 1 hp per rank of Healing proficiency the victim or ally possesses (e.g. skilled healers are better at safely excising maggots.) Once the maggots are deep in the victim’s body, only *cure disease* (by spell or proficiency) can remove them.

If not removed or killed, the maggots burrow ceaselessly through the victim’s body, inflicting 1 necrotic damage per turn per maggot. If the victim is reduced to 0 hp, he dies.

###### Ecology

Although they resemble the larval form of flies, murder maggots are a distinct species. They emerge from their eggs full grown and do not metamorphize or pupate into other forms. Each murder maggot can lay eggs once per year.

###### Spoils

A slain murder maggot can be harvested with Animal Husbandry 2 for the following component useful in magic research:

* dried grub (1/6 st., 5gp, *cause injury, extinguish life, incite madness*)

### Mammoth

Mammoths are northern cousins to elephants, adapted to colder climates by a thick coat of shaggy hair. They measure 23’ long and 13’ tall at the shoulder and weigh around 18,000 lbs. Unlike elephants, mammoths are highly aggressive and, some claim, carnivorous. Mammoths were long considered extinct by the sages of Aura, until mammoth-mounted Jutlanders invaded Dappakosea from the cold lands north of the Jutting Mountains.

###### Combat

Mammoths have **acute hearing** and **acute olfaction.** They gain a +2 bonus to avoid surprise in their natural habitat.

Mammoths prefer to start combat by **charging** with their tusks. The tusks deal double damage dice (4d6 {P!} each) when used in a charge.

If closely pressed, mammoths will attempt to **trample** their opponents (p. XX). A mammoth gains a +4 bonus to attack throws when attempting to trample a creature of large size or smaller. If struck, the creature takes damage must make a Paralysis saving throw or be forced aside 10’, landing **prone**. A small creature saves at -8. a man-sized creature at -6, and a large creature at -4. A mammoth can cleave after a successful trample attack that forces aside a creature.

###### Ecology

When mammoths are encountered, there is a 50% chance they will be a matriarchal herd. (Otherwise, it’s a bachelor herd.) In a matriarchal herd, the mammoths will be accompanied by 1d4 juvenile mammoths and 1d3 baby mammoths. Juvenile mammoths are huge size, have AC 4, Spd 90’, HD 7+2, and attack by trampling (4d4 {B!}). Juvenile mammoths can only take a +4 bonus versus and force aside small and man-sized creatures, which save at -6 and -4 respectively. Baby mammoths are large size, have AC 3, Spd 90’, HD 5, and attack by stomping (1d8 {B}).

###### Spoils

A slain mammoth can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following component useful in magic research:

* tusks (30 st, 1800gp, *call of the ancient tusk, force of impetus, striking*, armor +2, weapon +3)

If not used for magic research, a mammoth’s two tusks each fetch 2d4x100gp and weigh 1 st per 100gp value. A mammoth’s hide fetches 240gp and weighs 48 st.

Mammoths are much less agreeable than elephants to taking the yoke, but if tamed can be trained as powerful war mounts.

###### Lore

*The caverns that perforate the Jutting Mountains are extensively decorated with cave paintings, illustrations of such great antiquity that they must precede the Day Without Night. Among these paintings can be seen many beasts that are now extinct in Aurëpos, most notably the great tusked mammoth…*

### Man, Bandit

As the great civilizations of Aurëpos have slowly crumbled into a dark age of disorder and violence, more and more commoners have rebuked to outlawry – some from desperation, others from opportunism. Banditry is now an ever-present danger on even the safest highways of Aurëpos.

Most (85%) of bandits are Chaotic, not because they consciously serve the chthonic cause but because they actively work to undermine the law and order of civilization. A small number (15%), who limit themselves to preying on the corrupt and dishonest, count as Neutral. The latter sometimes become folk heroes to the common people, and adventurers who capture or slay them might earn the ire, rather than praise, of the locals.

###### Combat

Bandits have all the **thief skills** of 1st level thieves. In addition, they are experts at **waylaying enemies** in ambushes (Skulking proficiency) and **surviving in the wild** (Survival proficiency).

In combat, they prefer to attack by surprise or from the rear. They can **backstab** with melee weapons or missile weapons at short range, gaining a +4 bonus to attack and dealing an additional damage die if they hit.

Bandits will usually be equipped with short bows, short swords, 2 daggers, and leather armor. Bandit leaders will carry thieves’ tools but the bandit gang members will usually not.

###### Ecology

Each bandit gang will be led by a 2nd level thief. Each bandit band will be led by a 3rd level thief. Each bandit camp will be run by a 5th level thief boss.

When bandits are encountered in a camp, certain additional creatures will be present. There is a 75% chance the camp will be guarded by 1d4 war dogs with spiked leather barding. The boss will always by guarded by a thuggish 4th level fighter. In addition, there is a 50% chance for a 4th level assassin and a 50% chance for a 4th level mage to be employed by the boss.

###### Spoils

A slain bandit can be harvested with Healing 1 for the following component useful in magic research:

* heart (1/6 st, 6gp, *beguile humanoid*)

Bandits do not have magic items by treasure type. Instead, bandit leaders should be assigned magic items using the ***ACKS II JJ***rules (p. XX), whether they are in lair or not.

###### Notes

This monster listing is just an example. It assumes that bandits are 1st level thieves. The GM should feel free to devise other bandits for other regions with different proficiencies and equipment.

### Man, Berserker

From time to time, young men from Jutland and other barbaric regions come together to form cultic warrior brotherhoods dedicated to battle. Such men are known as berserkers for the battle lust that overtakes them in battle. They rove far and wide throughout Aurëpos, sometimes earning their keep as mercenaries or housecarls and other times simply taking what they want with fire and sword.

Most (75%) Jutlandic berserkers venerate Tür, god of strength, but a minority (25%) are Chaotic cultists of Baleyg, god of bloodlust and battle. The former tend to fight for glory or plunder, but the latter will give battle simply for the joy of bloodshed. (The Aurans refer to these gods as Türas and Bel, respectively.)

###### Combat

Berserkers have **animal reflexes** and gain a +1 bonus to initiative. As raiders and looters, they are **naturally stealthy** before they go berserk, so characters encountering them suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls. As **skilled warriors** they gain a +1 damage bonus.

A berserker can enter a **berserker rage** anytime he makes an attack. While enraged, he gains a +2 bonus to attack throws and becomes immune to fear. However, the berserker has a -2 penalty to AC and becomes limited in his tactics. He cannot conduct defensive movement to retreat or withdraw from an enemy within 5’ and cannot move in such a way that the range between himself and the nearest visible threat would increase. He must advance 5’ after cleaving if necessary to do so to engage an enemy and he has sufficient movement. Once it has begun, a berserker rage cannot be ended until combat ends.

50% of berserker gangs will be equipped with will be equipped with spears, hand axes, shields, and chain mail and 50% will be equipped with great axes and chainmail armor.

###### Ecology

Each berserker gang will be led by a 2nd level barbarian. Each berserker warband will be led by a 3rd level barbarian. Each berserker camp will be captained by a 4th level barbarian.

###### Spoils

A slain berserker can be harvested with Healing 1 for the following component useful in magic research:

* heart (1/6 st, 10gp, *beguile humanoid*)

Berserkers do not have magic items by treasure type. Instead, berserker leaders should be assigned magic items using the ***ACKS II JJ***rules (p. XX), whether they are in lair or not.

###### Notes

This monster listing is just an example. It assumes that berserkers are 1st level Jutland barbarians. The GM should feel free to devise other berserkers for other regions with different proficiencies and equipment.

This monster entry can be used to represent professional housecarls by replacing Berserkergang proficiency with Fighting Style (weapon & shield) proficiency.

### Man, Brigand

When the drums of war beat, the lords of Aurëpos are eager to hire mercenaries and sellswords to supplement their legions. Many young and desperate men respond to these calls, leaving behind farms and families to take up arms. Some are crippled or slain by battle or disease. Most see little action and simply return to their farms when the war ends. But others find that the blood and plunder of war suits them. When the wars end, these men become brigands, outlaws, and renegades, banded together under the shared interest of stealing and pillaging.

###### Combat

As veterans of many battles, brigands have **combat reflexes** that grant a +1 bonus to initiative. They are **skilled warriors** who gain a +1 damage bonus.

66% of brigand gangs encountered will be bowmen equipped with short bow, short sword, dagger, and leather armor. 33% will be medium cavalry equipped with lance, sword, shield, lamellar armor, and scale-barded medium warhorse. (A typical bandit camp of 7 bands of 5 gangs will consist of 1 company of 120 bowmen and 1 company of 60 medium cavalry.)

###### Ecology

Each gang of brigands will be led by a 2nd level fighter. Each band of brigands will be led by a 3rd level fighter. A brigand outpost or camp will be captained by a 6th level fighter. As long as the captain is alive, the brigands will gain a +2 bonus to morale rolls.

When brigands are encountered in a camp, certain additional creatures will be present. The captain will employ 2 4th level explorers or thieves as scouts. There is a 50% chance that the brigands will be ministered to by 1d3 3rd level crusaders led by a crusader of level 1d3+2. There is a 50% chance that the brigands will be accompanied by 1d2 theurgists (2nd level mages) led by a mage of level 1d3+2.

Gang leaders will be equipped in the same manner as their gangs, while the captain and each band leader will be equipped with lance, sword, shield, plate armor, and medium warhorse with chain barding. Other leveled characters will have equipment appropriate to their class and level.

###### Spoils

A slain brigand can be harvested with Healing 1 for the following component useful in magic research:

* heart (1/6 st, 10gp, *beguile humanoid*)

Brigands do not have magic items by treasure type. Instead, brigand leaders should be assigned magic items using the ***ACKS II JJ***rules (p. XX), whether they are in lair or not.

###### Notes

This monster listing is just an example. It assumes brigands are veteran (1st level) bowmen and medium cavalry. It should not be construed to mean that brigands can never be 0th level regular troops or cannot be light infantry, heavy infantry, or other types.

The Judge can and should stock his wilderness with brigands that are trained and equipped in sensible ways for his campaign!

In ***Domains at War*** terms, brigands are classified as elite veteran bowmen and/or medium cavalry.

### Man, Commoner

Commoners are the peasants and serfs that make up the majority of the human population of Aurëpos.

###### Combat

Commoners are not warriors. They lack proficiency with any weapons or armor and suffer a -1 penalty to attack throws (already factored into their listing) and gain no benefit from high attributes. If forced to fight, they will equip themselves with field axes, hammers, picks, and shovels, or with rusty or aged weapons, all dealing 1d6-1 damage. However, they must make morale rolls every round of combat unless their steward is leading them.

###### Ecology

Each commoner work-gang will be led by a yeoman (1st level fighter). Each commoner band will be led by a reeve (2nd level fighter). A hamlet will be led by led by a steward (3rd level fighter). All of these leaders will be middle aged, with a -1 penalty to attack throws, armor class, damage, initiative, and hp per HD, and initiative. The yeomen will be equipped like ordinary commoners. The reeve and steward will be equipped with hand axe or sword, shield, and chainmail armor.

Commoner homesteads and hamlets will have adult noncombatants (e.g. adolescent, disabled, elderly, nursing, or pregnant) and juveniles equal to 100% and 300% of the number of commoners respectively. These have Spd 90’, AC 0, 1 hp, ML -4, and do not fight.

When commoners are encountered in a hamlet, certain additional creatures will be present. There will be oxen, pigs, cows, and sheep equal to 100%, 100%, 300%, and 3200% of the number of commoners. In addition, the hamlet will have a catechist (1st level crusader) to minister to the people’s spiritual needs. (At the Judge’s discretion, priestesses or shamans can replace crusaders.)

Commoners encountered in hills or mountains have a 50% and 75% chance respectively to be **shepherds** instead of farmers. Each work-gang of shepherds will be accompanied by 2d6x100 goats or sheep or (in deserts) 6d10 camels. There will not be oxen, pigs, or cows in the hamlet or manor. For every 50 goats/sheep, there will be 1 hunting dog.

Commoners encountered on the coast or at sea will be **fishermen** instead of farmers. Each work-gang of fishermen will crew 1d3 sail boats. If encountered within one hour of dawn or dusk, the fishermen will be traveling to or from a rich fishing ground. At any other time, they will be fishing. Each sail boat will have up to 4d10 x 10 st. of fish per fisherman.

###### Spoils

A slain commoner can be harvested with Healing 1 for the following component useful in magic research:

* heart (1/6 st, 5gp, *beguile humanoid*)

Commoners do not have magic items by treasure type. Instead, commoner leaders should be assigned magic items using the ***ACKS II JJ***rules (p. XX), whether they are in lair or not.

###### Notes

This commoner hamlet in this monster listing is equivalent to 50 peasant families, with 50 commoners, 50 noncombatant commoners, and 150 juveniles, for a total of 250 humans. It is based on the economic assumptions explained in ***ACKS II JJ***.

### Man, Merchant

Merchants trade goods over great distances. When the Auran Empire was its height, it was said that a solitary merchant could trek from Alakyrum to Arganos without ever risking an encounter with bandits or brigands. In this benighted era, merchants must organize into caravans for safety, and hire many guards outside of the most civilized territory.

###### Combat

Merchants prefer diplomacy to battle. If forced to fight, merchants will be equipped with crossbow, short sword, dagger, and chainmail armor.

While not particularly effective or dangerous combatants, merchants are highly practiced at **treachery**. They can force creatures they encounter to make surprise rolls at a -3 penalty by treacherously attacking during parley.

###### Ecology

For protection in their long overland journeys, merchants organize into large caravans consisting of 10-40 large wagons. Each wagon will be drawn by four heavy draft horses and driven by one merchant. Every merchant caravan will be led by a mercantilist (5th level venturer) who owns the caravan and employs the other merchants. The mercantilist will be equipped with crossbow, short sword, dagger, and chainmail armor.

Merchant caravans encountered outside of civilized territory will be protected by caravan guards. Every 10 wagons will be defended by a band of 15 0th level guards and 5 1st level fighters, led by one 3rd level and three 2nd level fighters. 50% of caravan guards will be equipped with crossbows, swords, shields, and chainmail armor, and seated on the wagons. lances, swords, shields, lamellar armor, and leather-barded medium warhorses or war camels. Use the characteristics for patrollers (p. XX).

If merchants are encountered on a river, substitute a convoy of 1-4 large barges for a caravan of 10-40 large wagons. Each barge will have 10 merchants with Seafaring crewing it and (outside of civilized territory) will have a compliment of marines (15 0th level, 5 1st, 3 2nd, 1 3rd) guarding it.

###### Spoils

A slain merchant can be harvested with Healing 1 for the following component useful in magic research:

* heart (1/6 st, 6gp, *beguile humanoid*)

Merchants do not have magic items by treasure type. Instead, merchant leaders should be assigned magic items using the ***ACKS II JJ***rules (p. XX), whether they are in lair or not.

In lieu of rolling for treasure type, the Judge can assign cargo to the caravan. There will be 3,200 st of cargo per 10 wagons (or large barge). Cargo will generally be a mix of common and precious merchandise with an average value of 1gp per stone. For each wagon, roll for one type of cargo on the Random Merchandise table from ***ACKS II RR***p. XX. (For your convenience we’ve re-printed it on the adjoining page.)

###### Notes

This monster listing is just an example. It assumes merchants are 1st level venturers. It should not be construed to mean that merchants can never be 0th level or noncombatant characters, that leveled characters of other classes cannot be merchants, or that mercenary guards can’t carry other equipment.

### Man, Merchant Mariner

Despite the dangerous surge in piracy, the waters of the Ammas Aurë remain the most important medium of commerce and trade. Merchant mariners sail regularly between the great commercial hubs such as Aura, Uttar, and Zidium as well as countless smaller ports-of-call.

###### Combat

Merchant mariners prefer to avoid combat. If pressed into battle, they will be equipped with either clubs or hand axes. 10% of sailors will have nets.

###### Ecology

When merchant mariners are encountered, use the Lair roll to determine whether the mariners are crewing a solitary vessel or a fleet of vessels. In either case, merchant mariners encountered on lakes or rivers will be in barges while merchant mariners encountered on high seas will be in sailing ships. Roll 1d10 to determine the size of the barge or ships. The number of sailors, passengers, and merchants encountered, as well as the captain’s level, volume of cargo carried, is determined by the type of vessel, the number of vessels, and the crew requirements for the vessels.

|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Roll | Waters | Vessel | Fleet Size | Sailors |
| 1-6 | River/lake | Small barge | 4d6 | 5 |
| 7-9 | River/lake | Large barge | 2d6 | 10 |
| 10 | River/lake | Huge barge | 1d2 | 50 |
| 1-5 | Sea | Small ship | 1d12 | 10 |
| 6-8 | Sea | Large ship | 1d6 | 20 |
| 9-10 | Sea | Huge ship | 1d3 | 40 |

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Vessel | Passengers | Cargo | Merchant Lvl |
| Small barge | 2d6-1 | 4d6 x 100 st | 1st |
| Large barge | 6d6 | 3d4 x 700 st | 2nd |
| Huge barge | 2d6x60 | 3d6 x 10,000 st | 5th |
| Small ship | 6d10 | 3d4 x 1000 st | 1st |
| Large ship | 2d8x10 | 6d6 x 1000 st | 4th |
| Huge ship | 4d6x10 | 7d10 x 1000 st | 5th |

As parts of its crew, each vessel will have a sailing master (0th level specialist with two ranks of Seafaring) and a navigator (0th level specialist with one rank of Seafaring and one rank of Navigation).

Each vessel will carry one merchant captain of between 1st and 5th level depending on type. Merchant mariner fleets will be led by a merchant commodore two levels higher than the merchant captains. Merchant captains and commodores are usually venturers, but can also be explorers, fighters, thieves, bards, or even barbarians. Captains will have two ranks of Seafaring, while commodores will be master mariners with three ranks of Seafaring.

Roll 1d10 to determine the type of passengers being transported: 1-6 commoners, 7-9 pilgrims, 10 marines. Commoners will be 50% noncombatants. Marines can be heavy infantry, light infantry, or composite bowmen.

###### Spoils

A slain merchant mariner with Healing 1 can be harvested for the following component useful in magic research:

* heart (1/6 st, 6gp, *beguile humanoid*)

Merchant mariner captains and commodores should be assigned magic items using the ***ACKS II JJ***rules (p. XX).

The spoils of a merchant marine fleet are found in its passengers (who can be held for ransom or sold into slavery) and cargo. Cargo will generally be a mix of common and precious merchandise with an average value of 1gp per stone. For each die rolled for cargo volume, roll for one type of cargo:

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1d100 | Common Merchandise | Container | Price / St |
| 1-20 | Grain & vegetables | Bags | 0.12gp |

###### Notes

This monster listing is just an example. It assumes merchant mariners are 0th level sailors led by a small number of experienced venturers. It should not be construed to mean that merchant mariners can never be 1st level characters, or that leveled characters of other classes cannot be present.

### Man, Naval Mariner

The struggle between the great realms of Aurëpos is fought as often at sea as on land. Naval mariners can be encountered engaging in coastal patrols, exploratory journeys, fleet maneuvers, raids, scouting expeditions, or transport missions.

###### Combat

Adventurers in 1.5 or 2.5-rower galleys or longships suffer a -2 penalty to reaction rolls with naval mariners, who assume them to be pirates or raiders. Adventurers in war galleys flagged as belonging to one the mariners’ enemy realms suffer a -4 penalty.

Hostile reactions with naval mariners triggers an immediate attack while unfriendly reactions triggers an attempt to board to inspect for criminals, contraband, or untaxed goods.

###### Ecology

When naval mariners are encountered, use the Lair roll to determine whether the mariners are crewing a solitary galley or a fleet of galleys. If a single vessel is encountered, roll 1d20 to determine the type of galley. If a fleet of vessels is encountered, roll 1d6! for the its size, and then roll 1d20 to determine the type of each galley in the fleet.

The number of sailors, rowers, and marines, as well as the captain’s level, is determined by the type of vessel, the number of vessels, and the crew requirements for the vessels.

|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Roll | Galley | Sailors | Rowers | Marines | Level |
| 1 | 1-rower | 3 | 30 | - | 3rd |
| 2-3 | 2-rower | 5 | 90 | 10 | 4th |
| 4-6 | 2.5-rower | 10 | 120 | 10 | 5th |
| 7-10 | 3-rower | 15 | 170 | 15 | 6th |
| 11-14 | 4-rower | 15 | 180 | 75 | 6th |
| 15-17 | 5-rower | 20 | 300 | 75 | 6th |
| 18-19 | 6-rower | 20 | 336 | 100 | 6th |
| 20 | 8-rower | 50 | 440 | 150 | 7th |

50% of **marines** will be archers equipped with short sword, short bow, and leather armor and 50% will be heavy infantry equipped with short sword, shield, and laminated linen armor. All marines will be equipped with grappling hooks and 50’ ropes. They will have one boarding ramp per 8 marines (rounded up). Marines are **skilled warriors** who gain a +1 damage bonus. Rowers and sailors will be equipped with short swords, daggers, and leather armor.

As parts of its crew, each vessel will have a sailing master (0th level specialist with two ranks of Seafaring) and a navigator (0th level specialist with one rank of Seafaring and one rank of Navigation).

Each vessel will carry one naval captain of between 3rd and 7th level depending on type. Naval fleets will be led by a merchant commodore commanding the fleet from its largest vessel. The commodore will be one level higher than the vessel’s captain. Naval captains and commodores are usually fighters. Captains will have two ranks of Seafaring, while commodores will be master mariners with three ranks of Seafaring.

###### Spoils

A slain naval mariner with Healing 1 can be harvested for the following component useful in magic research:

* heart (1/6 st, 6gp, *beguile humanoid*)

Merchant mariner captains and commodores should be assigned magic items using the ***ACKS II JJ***rules (p. XX). Treasure on board a naval vessels represents the troop’s paychest.

### Man, Nomad

Nomads are pastoralists who make seasonal migrations in search of pasture. They are found primarily are regions west of the Auran Empire, including Opelenea, Kemesh, Shebatea, and Skysostan. Nomads dwell in temporary camps of tents or other portable structures and travel with large herds of livestock. Nomads often trade with humans and demi-humans they encounter, but will almost always clash with beastmen.

###### Combat

33% of nomad warriors will be veterans with 1 HD equipped with composite bow, lance, scimitar, chain mail, and steppe warhorses or war camels. 66% of nomad warriors will be regulars with 1-1 HD, equipped with composite bows, swords, leather armor, and steppe riding horses or riding camels.

The veterans have **animal reflexes** that grant a +1 bonus to initiative and **precise shooting skills** (as the proficiency). They are **skilled warriors** who gain a +1 damage bonus.

###### Ecology

Each caravan of nomads will be led by a 5th level barbarian accompanied by five 2nd level barbarians. A nomad camp will be ruled by a 7th level barbarian chief. As long as the nomad chief is alive, the nomad will gain a +2 bonus to morale rolls.

Nomad camps will have adult noncombatants (adolescent, disabled, elderly, nursing, or pregnant) and juveniles equal to 100% and 300% of the number of warriors respectively. These have Spd 90’, AC 0, 1 hp, ML -4, and do not fight.

When nomads are encountered in a camp, certain additional creatures will be present. There will be steppe horses or camels, cows, and sheep equal to 100%, 400%, and 2000% of the number of nomad warriors The camp will be protected by 4d6 trained hunting dogs. In addition, there will be a 6th level barbarian serving as sub-chief and a 6th level shaman advising the chief.

The nomad leaders will be equipped with composite bow, lance, sword, shield, lamellar armor, and steppe warhorses or war camels.

###### Spoils

A slain nomad can be harvested for the following component useful in magic research:

* heart (1/6 st, 5gp or 10gp, *beguile humanoid*)

Nomads do not have magic items by treasure type. Instead, nomad leaders should be assigned magic items using the ***ACKS II JJ***rules (p. XX), whether they are in lair or not.

###### Notes

This nomad camp in this monster listing is equivalent to 175 nomad families. The number of veterans and leaders is based on the demographic and economic assumptions of nomad families explained in ***Axioms Issue 22: What is Best in Life?***and summarized in ***ACKS II JJ***(p. XX).

In ***Domains at War*** terms, nomads are classified as either elite veteran camel lancers or regular camel archers. If using *Axioms 22,* they can also be any of the troop types in that issue.

### Man, Patroller

Patrollers are organized groups of soldiers dispatched to keep order in the civilized realms of Aurëpos.

###### Combat

25% of patrollers will be veterans with 1 HD. The remaining 75% will be regulars with 1-1 HD. The veterans have **combat reflexes** that grants +1 initiative bonus and are **skilled warriors** who gain a +1 damage bonus.

The equipment carried by patrollers will depend on terrain type. Patrollers encountered in barrens, desert, grassland, hills, or shrubland will be equipped with lances, swords, shields, lamellar armor, and leather-barded medium warhorses or war camels. Patrollers encountered in forests or mountains will be equipped with composite bows, short swords, and leather armor, and not mounted.

###### Ecology

Each patrol will be led by one 2nd level fighter. Each band will be led by one 3rd level fighter. A patroller camp or outpost will be captained by a 6th level fighter. As long as the captain is alive, the patrollers will gain a +2 bonus to morale rolls.

When patrollers are encountered in a camp, certain additional creatures will be present. The captain will employ 3 4th level explorers or thieves as scouts. There is a 50% chance a 5th level crusader will be accompanying the patrollers as a healer or undead slayer. There is a 50% chance a 5th level mage will accompany the patrollers to provide magical support.

Patroller leaders will be equipped in the same manner as their patrols. The leaders of forest and mountain patrollers have a 25% chance to be explorers rather than fighters. Leaders should be assigned magic items using the ***ACKS II JJ***rules (p. XX).

###### Spoils

A slain patroller can be harvested for the following component useful in magic research:

* heart (1/6 st, 5gp or 10gp, *beguile humanoid*)

Patrollers do not have magic items by treasure type. Instead, patroller leaders should be assigned magic items using the ***ACKS II JJ***rules (p. XX), whether they are in lair or not.

###### Notes

This monster listing is just an example. It assumes patrollers are regular mercenaries (0th level) equipped as medium cavalry or composite bowmen. It should not be construed to mean that patrollers can never be 1st level veterans or cannot be light infantry, heavy infantry, or other types. The Judge can and should stock his wilderness with patrollers that are trained and equipped in sensible ways for his campaign!

In ***Domains at War*** terms, patrollers are classified as elite veteran or regular composite bowmen and/or medium cavalry.

### Man, Pilgrim

The common people of Aurëpos rarely leave the vicinity of their hamlets or villages. However, from time to time, more adventurous or devout sorts will set out on pilgrimages to sacred places, holy temples, or great festivals and games.

Most pilgrims (65%) are Lawful and pursuing their pilgrimage for reasons of civic or religious duty. Some (30%) are Neutral and using the pilgrimage as a pretext for adventure or escape. A small number (5%) are Chaotic cultists or subversives trekking towards dark shrines or places of death.

###### Combat

Pilgrims are not warriors. They lack proficiency with any weapons or armor and suffer a -1 penalty to attack throws (already factored into their listing) and gain no benefit from high attributes.

If forced to fight, they will defend themselves with quarterstaffs, walking sticks, shepherd’s crooks, and similar implements, all dealing 1d6-1 damage. However, they must make morale rolls every round of combat unless their steward is leading them.

###### Ecology

Each troupe of pilgrims will be led by a 1st level crusader watching over them. The crusaders will be equipped with maces, slings, shields, and chain mail. Each band of pilgrims will be guided by a 2nd level explorer equipped with short bow, short sword, shield, and leather armor.

Pilgrim camps (wilderness lairs) will be led by a vicar (a 5th level crusader). Additionally, there is a 33% chance a sister disciple (4th level priestess) will be present in the camp. If so, the priestess will be accompanied by 2d4 novices (1st level priestesses).

Pilgrim leaders should be assigned magic items using the ***ACKS II JJ***rules (p. XX).

###### Spoils

A slain pilgrim can be harvested for the following component useful in magic research:

* heart (1/6 st, 5gp, *beguile humanoid*)

Pilgrims do not have magic items by treasure type. Instead, pilgrim leaders should be assigned magic items using the ***ACKS II JJ***rules (p. XX), whether they are in lair or not.

###### Notes

This monster listing is just an example. It assumes that pilgrims are normal men and women from the Auran Empire with some crusaders and explorers to guide them. The GM should feel free to devise other pilgrims for other regions with different proficiencies, equipment, and leaders.

### Man, Pirate

At the height of the Auran Empire’s power, piracy had almost been eliminated from the Ammasaurëan Sea, but with the empire’s decline pirates have become an ever-present menace that threatens coastal towns and merchant ships alike. Both coasts of Ulrukan are also plagued by pirates, some of whom sail through the Pillars of Dawn or the Straits of Kem to raid Aurëpos. Pirates commonly dock in the increasingly-lawless ports of the Syrnasos Islands, Corcano, and Jutland.

Most (70%) of pirates are Chaotic-aligned buccaneers who will prey on any and every ship they encounter but a minority (30%) are Neutral-aligned privateers, who will only attack ships sailing under the flags of their nation’s enemies.

###### Combat

All pirates are **elite marines** and can flexibly function as sailors, rowers, or marines, as needed. As **swashbuckling men of action**, they gain a +1 bonus to AC in light armor. They are **skilled warriors** who gain a +1 damage bonus.

Pirates serving as rowers or sailors will be equipped with short swords, daggers, and leather armor. Pirates serving as marines will also be equipped with shortbows, grappling hooks, and 50’ ropes. They will have one boarding ramp per 8 marines (rounded up).

Pirates usually attempt to capture, not sink, their targets, because their galleys do not have the cargo capacity to carry the plunder. Buccaneers (chaotic pirates) will usually attempt to capture any sailing ships they encounter. The reaction roll will determine whether they immediately attack with murderous intent or offer a chance to surrender first. Buccaneers will not usually attack galleys (they’re too well-armed and dangerous). Privateers will attack both galleys and sailing ships of enemy realms.

When they find a suitable target, pirates will approach under sail and oar at full speed, with on-deck marines volleying missile fire at any exposed crew.

When they pull adjacent to the target, the on-deck marines will attempt to board by grapple line or ramp, with successive waves from below deck marines, rowers, and sailors (in that order).

###### Ecology

Because pirates use fast, shallow-drafted galleys to pursue their targets, they can be found on any navigable body of water, whether lake, sea, or river.

When a group of pirates are encountered, use the Lair roll to determine whether they are organized into a flotilla of 1 to 3 vessels or a fleet of 2 to 8 vessels. Then roll 1d10: On a 1-5, the pirates are out raiding; 6-9, the pirates are returning home with captured booty; 10, the pirates are docked at a (possibly uncharted) cove, island, islet, reef, or river bank.

Roll 1d6 on the table below to determine the type of galleys the pirates field – either 1.5- or 2.5-rowers. The number of pirates encountered is then determined by the type of vessels, the number of vessels, and the crew requirements for the vessels.

The pirates will be assigned to the various rolls of marines, rowers, and sailors as shown. Note that some marines will be on deck and others below deck, noted as [on deck]/[below deck].

|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Roll | Galley | # Vessels | Sailors | Rowers | Marines |
| 1-4 | 1.5-Rower | 1d3 / 1d8 | 5 | 50 | 5 / 15 |
| 5-6 | 2.5-Rower | 1d2 / 1d6 | 5 | 50 | 10 / 25 |

Each vessel will be led by a 5th level pirate master, accompanied by two 4th level pirate mates. Pirate flotillas, and pirate fleets of less than 350 pirates, will be led by a 6th level pirate captain, who will replace one of the vessel’s masters. Pirate fleets of 350 or more will be led by a pirate king of 7th level. A pirate king will always have a chief mate of 6th level and will have a 75% chance of employing a mage of level 4+1d3.

Mates, masters, captains, and kings are usually fighters but they can also be barbarians, explorers, ruinguards, or even venturers. Pirate masters and captains will have two ranks of Seafaring, while pirate kings will be master mariners with three ranks of Seafaring. Pirate mates will have either two ranks of Seafaring, one rank of Seafaring and Navigation, or three ranks of Craft (shipwright).

###### Spoils

A slain pirate can be harvested for the following component useful in magic research:

* heart (1/6 st, 10gp, *beguile humanoid*)

When pirates are encountered out raiding (not in their lair), they typically do not have any treasure -- that’s why they are out raiding! When pirates are encountered returning home, each vessel has a 25% chance to have recently captured a merchant mariner vessel. If so, part of the pirate crew will be sailing the captured vessel (along with its captured crew and cargo), back home. Use the Man, Merchant Mariner entry to roll up the captured ship. Pirates returning home with captured ships will attempt to evade combat.

When pirates are encountered docked, each vessel will have treasure type J. In addition, the fleet will have 1d4 hostages for every 50 pirates. Hostages can be rolled up as random NPCs using the tables in the ***ACKS II JJ***(p. XX). Hostages can be ransomed or returned to their homes.

However, pirates never have magic items by treasure type. Instead, pirate leaders should be assigned magic items using the ***ACKS II JJ***rules (p. XX), whether they are in lair or not.

###### Notes

This monster listing is just an example. It should not be construed to mean that all pirates are 0th level mercenaries who fight with dual weapons and have Swashbuckling proficiency. The Judge can and should stock his seas with other pirates that are trained and equipped in sensible ways for his campaign!

### Man, Raider

Unlike berserkers, who devote their full time to fighting, raiders are seasonal warriors. In between reaping and sowing crops, the young men of Jutland and other barbaric regions are wont to raid foreign shores in search of booty. Because of their heroic culture of battle, these part-time farmers are often as or even more skilled than the soldiers they confront in raids.

###### Combat

33% of raiders will be veterans equipped with spear, sword, shield, and chainmail armor. 33% of raiders will be regulars equipped with spear, battle axe, shield and leather armor. The final 33% will be regulars equipped with short bow, hand axe, and leather armor.

Veterans have **animal reflexes** and gain a +1 bonus to initiative. As raiders and looters, they are **naturally stealthy**, so characters encountering them suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls. As **skilled warriors** they gain a +1 damage bonus.

###### Ecology

Each raider gang will be led by a 2nd level barbarian. Each raider warband will be led by a 3rd level barbarian. A raider camp will be run by a 6th level barbarian.

If raiders are encountered on water, they will be the crew and passengers of longships. There will be one longship per 60 raiders, rounded down to a minimum of 1 longship.

###### Spoils

A slain raider can be harvested with Healing 1 for the following component useful in magic research:

* heart (1/6 st, 5gp or 10gp, *beguile humanoid*)

Raiders will not have magic items by treasure type. Instead, raider leaders should be assigned magic items using the ***ACKS II JJ***rules (p. XX), whether they are in lair or not.

When raiders are encountered in camp, they will always have treasure. When raiders are encountered at sea, roll 1d10. On 1-5, the raiders are heading out to raid and have no treasure. On 6-10, the raiders are returning home with treasure. Raiders returning home with treasure will attempt to evade encounters if possible.

###### Notes

This monster listing is just an example. It should not be construed to mean raiders cannot have other proficiencies or troop types. The Judge can and should stock his wilderness with raiders that are trained and equipped in sensible ways for his campaign! The number of veterans and leaders is based on the demographics of heroism for barbarians, summarized in ***ACKS II JJ***(p. XX).

In ***Domains at War*** terms, raiders are classified as elite veteran heavy infantry C, regular light infantry B, or regular bowmen.

### Man, Tribal Warrior

Tribal warriors are rarely seen outside remote regions far from the Auran Empire. They are found primarily in Ulruk, throughout the coastal Ivory Kingdoms and especially the inland jungles. While lacking the sophisticated technology of civilized realms, tribal warriors are fierce combatants and skilled hunters.

About 25% of tribal warriors are Chaotic cannibals who kill and eat other sapient creatures. Chaotic tribal warriors are always Hostile to strangers. Neutral tribal warriors, while superstitious and suspicious of strangers, roll reactions normally.

###### Combat

33% of tribal warriors will be veterans with 1 HD equipped with bola net, 3 javelins, hand axe, and leather armor. The remaining 66% will be regulars with 1-1 HD equipped with bola, 5 feathered darts, hand axe, and hide armor.

The veterans have **animal reflexes** that grant a +1 bonus to initiative and are **skilled warriors** that gain a +1 damage bonus. Both regulars and veterans are **proficient runners** (150’ speed).

###### Ecology

Each gang of tribal warriors will be led by a 2nd level barbarian. Each band of tribal warriors will be led by a 3rd level barbarian. A tribal village will be ruled by a 7th level barbarian chief. As long as the chief is alive, the tribal warriors will gain a +2 bonus to morale rolls.

Tribal villages will have adult noncombatants (adolescent, disabled, elderly, nursing, or pregnant) and juveniles equal to 100% and 300% of the number of tribal warriors respectively. These have Spd 90’, AC 0, 1 hp, ML -4, and do not fight.

When tribal warriors are encountered in a village, certain additional creatures will be present. The village will be protected by 4d6 trained hunting dogs or 2d6 cheetahs. There will be oxen, pigs, and cows equal to 100%, 100%, and 300% of the number of commoners. In addition, there will be a 6th level barbarian serving as sub-chief and a 6th level shaman advising the chief. The tribal leaders will be equipped with spear, hand axe, shield, and leather armor.

###### Spoils

A slain tribal warrior can be harvested with Healing 1 for the following component useful in magic research:

* heart (1/6 st, 5gp or 10gp, *beguile humanoid*)

Tribal warriors do not have magic items by treasure type. Instead, tribal leaders should be assigned magic items using the ***ACKS II JJ***rules (p. XX), whether they are in lair or not.

### Manes

Manes are magically corporealized souls of the dead which have not yet transmigrated to new bodies – or at least so the Empyrean theologians claim. The Chthonic cultists assert that manes are the last vestiges of deal souls who, having failed to necromantically prepare themselves in life for immortality, are doomed to soon disperse into oblivion.

The reasons why a soul might linger as a manes vary. Some manes are actively venerated by their descendants, whose worship sustains them in a sort of semi-divine status. Some might just be sustaining their existence for a brief period of time through their own will, dreading the destiny of rebirth or dissolution.

Unlike incorporeal undead, which linger on, manes have left the Celestial Sphere and return only when summoned or, occasionally, when a portal to the Empyrean Heaven or Chthonic Darkness draws them through. Upon returning to our sphere, manes take on a semi-corporeal form that resembles their state in life, albeit one with grey skin, dead eyes, and gravely utterances. They will speak whatever languages they knew in life.

###### Combat

Manes will manifest with ghostly weapons that resemble those they used in life. These will always be small or medium melee weapons that deal 1d6 {W!} damage. Manes without weapons can attack with a ghastly bite that deals 1d6 {P!} damage.

All manes are **immune** to necrotic and poisonous damage and **resistant** to all other mundane damage. As incarnations, manes can be held at bay by *holy circle* anddispelled with *counterspell* or *dispel magic*. Lawful manes (sometimes called “lares”) can be detected with *discern good* and destroyed with *dispel good*, while chaotic manes (called “lemures”) are revealed by *discern evil* and destroyed with *dispel evil.*

Being only semicorporeal, manes cannot exert leverage on the corporeal world nor bear loads of corporeal matter. They cannot carry equipment, open doors or chests, or trigger traps. They cannot disarm, force back, grapple, or knock down targets via special maneuvers. However, they are still blocked and damaged by corporeal matter (subject to their resistance).

###### Ecology

Manes are summoned from the spheres where the dead linger, the Empyrean Heaven or Chthonic Darkness. They have no natural habitat in Aurëpos.

###### Spoils

A destroyed mane can be harvested with Alchemy 2 for the following component useful in magic research:

* larvae (*holy blessing, holy circle, holy prayer,* 13gp)

### Manticore

Manticores are man-eating monsters with the faces of bearded men, the bodies of lions, the wings of giant bats, and the tails of giant scorpions. The tails terminate in a cluster of 24 barbed stingers arranged in rows like a morning star’s spikes. A typical manticore has a length of 10’, a wing span of 30’, and a weight of 1,000 lbs.

Zaharan myth professes that the first manticores were born of the union of Nasga, Chthonic goddess of beauty and pain, with Bel, Chthonic god of war. If so, then the creatures can rightly be said to have inherited the bloodthirstiness of their father and the sadism of their mother. They delight in feasting on living human flesh, favoring it above all other meat.

Manticores usually live in the mountains, but have been known to venture into dungeons, either in service to some powerful chaotic master or to be closer to prey.

Though sapient, manticores do not have their own language. They use the common languages spoken by the humans and beastmen in the regions they inhabit.

###### Combat

Manticores have **acute olfaction** that grants them a +1 bonus to avoid surprise in their natural habitat. They can track the scent of creatures for up to 4 miles with the equivalent of two ranks of Tracking proficiency.

The monsters are **masterful mimics** and can imitate the vocalizations of any animal, demi-human, or human on a successful proficiency throw of 3+. They use this ability to bait and lure prey to their doom.

A manticore usually prefers to attack from range (often while flying), hurling spikes from its tail at targets up to 270’ away. Once its prey is wounded and weakened, the manticore will move into melee to finish it off with claws and bite. Hurled spikes regrow at a rate of 2 per day.

###### Ecology

Manticores breed but rarely, and even after the eggs hatch, the juveniles require considerable care, for they can neither fly nor hurl tail spikes. When manticores are encountered in their lair, there is a 20% chance each manticore is guarding offspring. Roll 1d4 for their number and age: 1-2, it’s 1d4 eggs, 3-4, it’s 1d3 juveniles. Juvenile manticores have AC 3, Spd 90’, HD 3, and attack with 2 talons (1 {P}) and 1 nibble (1 {P}). Manticore eggs have 1 hp and weigh 1/6 st.

Manticores defending their young do not have to make morale rolls; they always fight to the death.

###### Spoils

A slain manticore can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the following components useful in magic research:

* barbed spikes (6 st, 360gp, *mage missile, slicing blow,* +2 arrows/bolts)

A manticore's pelt fetches 265gp and weighs 2 4/6 st.

### Mass, Gelatinous

A gelatinous mass resembles a block of transparent aspic jelly with inorganic material remains trapped and visible inside it. A typical gelatinous mass is 125 cubic feet and weighs 2,150lb; it can adjust its size to squeeze through crevasses or expand to fill corridors. The masses are utterly mindless and perpetually hungry, existing only to consume.

###### Combat

Gelatinous masses have **translucent bodies** that make them hard to spot. Creatures encountering them suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls. Their jelly-like forms are highly sensitive to vibrations, enabling the gelatinous masses to “see” by **terrestrial mechanoreception** over long distances equivalent to line of sight in full daylight. However, creatures that are flying, levitating, or otherwise not touching the ground are invisible to the sense.

When a gelatinous mass attacks, it attempts to engulf a creature in front of it (“front” being whichever direction it moved or desired to move). The gelatinous mass can ignore the target’s AC from armor, but not AC from DEX, magic items, natural armor, or spells. (Any creatures foolish or unlucky enough to move into the mass are automatically hit.)

If the gelatinous mass’s attack succeeds, the creature struck must make a Paralysis saving throw. If the save fails, the creature takes 2d4 {A!} damage and is **ingurgitated** into the mass. If the saving throw succeeds, the creature takes 2d4 {A!} damage but is not ingurgitated. The gelatinous mass can cleave after a successful attack that ingurgitates a creature, possibly ingurgitating another creature! However, the gelatinous mass cannot ingurgitate more than 10 small, 5 man-sized, or 2 large creatures at the same time. If new creatures are ingurgitated, one or more of the currently ingurgitated creatures are ejected from the mass to its “rear”.

While ingurgitated, a creature is **paralyzed** by the thick gelatin. It suffers 2d4 {A!} damage at the start of its initiative each round until either the gelatinous mass is destroyed or the creature dies. Should the ingurgitated creature die and remain in the mass for 6 turns, it is irrecoverably dissolved, along with any fabric or leather items it was carrying or wearing. (The mass’s acid cannot dissolve metal.)

Gelatinous masses are immune to enchantment effects and to acidic, cold, electrical, luminous, necrotic, and poisonous damage.

###### Ecology

Gelatinous masses ceaselessly creep along dungeon corridors and cave floors, absorbing carrion, creatures, and trash. They reproduce by budding, creating a gelatinous mess (baby) after consuming 2,150 lbs of organic matter.

Any encounter with a gelatinous cube can yield treasure, even though the creature has no lair. The treasure (if any) is always floating in its body, along with bits of bone, stone, and metal.

### Medusa

Sometimes the malice and hate that normally characterizes gorgons gives way to lust for a handsome or virile man. Sometimes the unfortunate recipient of the gorgon’s infatuation is captured and forced to satisfy her carnal desires; other times, a depraved or wicked man might voluntarily unite with a gorgon. Some crazed fools have even go so far as to blind themselves to be able to stay with their monstrous brides.

The offspring of such accursed unions are called medusas. Medusas are indistinguishable from human women, except that they have vicious snakes on their heads rather than hair. Medusas often disguise their true nature by wearing a hooded robe and veil, only to suddenly reveal their horrific aspect at an opportune moment.

Medusas have adopted Draconic as their language. They also speak the local dialects of the region where they grew up.

###### Combat

Medusas rely on the **venomous snakes** that adorn their heads to attack enemies in melee. A creature damaged by a snake bite must make a successful Death saving throw or die of poison 1d4+2 turns later.

In lieu of attacking with its venomous snakes, a medusa can direct its **petrifying gaze** in a cone 60' long and 30' wide in front of itself. Each creature within the cone that is beholding the medusa must make a Paralysis saving throw. If the save succeeds, the creature is not affected. If the save fails, the creature is instantly **petrified**.

###### Ecology

Although some try to blend into human settlements, most medusas dwell on the outskirts of civilization, often in abandoned villas or crumbling ruins. They enjoy the company of others of their kind, forming small coteries or covens.

Medusas can have offspring with both human and elven men. Children of the union (half-medusas) will appear to be ordinary members of their father’s race, albeit sometimes with a birthmark or strange feature. Medusas almost never raise their own children, usually abandoning them to a village or temple.

A medusa that survives until the end of its lifespan (95 years) does not die of old age. Instead, she undergoes a second metamorphosis lasting 1d6 days, during which she transforms into a gorgon (p. XX).

###### Spoils

A slain medusa can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the following components useful in magic research:

* eyes (1 4/6 st, 100gp, *cone of paralysis, hypnotic sigil, petrification*)

1d4 doses of viper venom (p. XX) can be extracted from a medusa’s snaky hair.

Half of the treasure in a medusa’s lair is likely to be on petrified victims, and will only be accessible if the victims are restored to flesh.

### Minotaur

These monstrous humanoids have the torsos of huge, muscled men and the heads of horned bulls. Some minotaurs have more bullish ancestry, with bovine legs, hooves, and fur, while others are more human, with the legs, feet, and hair of men. Whatever its ancestry, a typical minotaur stands 9’ tall and weighs 700 lbs.

Most Auran sages believe that minotaurs are magical crossbreeds, but the Zaharan myths claim that the minotaurs are the mortal descendants of Nargund, the Beast Lord, Chthonic god of hunting and predation. What is certain is that minotaurs delight in the thrill of hunting human beings. Minotaurs virtually always slay and eat the men they hunt, but they have been known to abduct and carry off young women, taking them back to their lairs for terrible consortium.

Minotaurs speak their own language, an archaic offshoot of Classical Nicean. They have a 50% chance of speaking a beastman tongue and 25% chance of speaking Common.

###### Combat

Minotaurs have **acute olfaction** granting them a +1 bonus to avoid surprise in their natural habitat. They can track the scent of creatures for up to 6 miles with the equivalent of three ranks of Tracking proficiency. Minotaurs are relentless and, unless they fail a morale roll, will inexorably chase fleeing prey, tracking enemies that they lose sight.

In combat, minotaurs can attack with a weapon or bite and gore with their horns. Due to their **monstrous prowess**, they deal extraordinary damage and gain a +3 damage bonus with weapons. Minotaurs generally favor great axes, morning stars, or pole arms. They wear little clothing, perhaps a loincloth or leather trousers with sandals, but their **thick skin** grants a +3 bonus to AC.

###### Ecology

Most minotaurs dwell in dungeons, where they can prey upon anyone who ventures within, but sometimes they establish crude settlements in abandoned ruins or desolate regions of wilderness.

Since all minotaurs are male, they reproduce by mating with either cows or human women. Half the offspring of such unholy unions are deformed monstrosities that die shortly after the birth; the other half are minotaurs babies. When encountered in a wilderness lair, there is a 25% chance there will be 2d3 captive human women and/or cows, 1d2 baby minotaurs, and 1d4 juvenile minotaurs. Juvenile minotaurs have AC 1, Spd 90’, HD 3, and attack with gore (1d4 {P}) and bite (1d4 {P}). Baby minotaurs have AC 0, Spd 90’, HD 2, and attack with gore (1d3 {P}) and bite (1d3 {P}). The captive human women are noncombatants with AC 0, Spd 120’, 1 hp, ML -4, who do not fight. Cows are 3 HD Herd Animals (p. XX).

###### Spoils

A slain minotaur can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 2 (combined ranks) for the following component useful in magic research:

If not used for magic research, a minotaur’s two horns each fetch 4d6gp and weigh 1 st per 80gp value.

### Mold, Mustard

Mustard mold has an earthy yellowish-brown color dotted with black or grey specks. A typical specimen is 10’ in diameter and 1,200 lbs in weight, though much larger molds are possible. Unlike other oozes, it is sessile, its only movement coming from its slow growth.

###### Combat

Mustard mold possesses **terrestrial mechanoreception** enabling it to sense vibration in the ground over long distances equivalent to line of sight in full daylight.

A non-magical item of fabric, leather, or wood that strikes mustard mold dissolves immediately (after dealing damage, if any). A magical item dissolves unless it succeeds on a Death Save (use the wielder or wearer’s target value, adding any magic bonus if applicable). A creature that attacks or touches mustard mold with its body suffers 1d6 extraordinary acidic damage.

Any time a creature attacks, touches, or moves into or through mustard mold, there is a 50% probability that the mold **ejects poisonous spores** into a 10’ cube area. Each creature inside the area must make a Death saving throw. If the save succeeds, there is no effect. If the save fails, the creature dies of poison after 6 rounds have elapsed.

Mustard mold is **immune** to enchantment effects and to acidic, arcane, cold, electric, luminous, necrotic, poisonous, and seismic damage. It has no resistance to fire damage or to bludgeoning, slashing, or piercing damage However, a non-magical wooden weapon that strikes grey goo dissolves immediately (as above). Direct sunlight renders mustard mold dormant.

###### Ecology

Mustard mold is found in dank caves and dungeons where it serves as a food source for cave locusts. It feeds on plants, animals, and other organic matter, but does not digest metal or stone.

It reproduces by budding, detaching a newborn mustard mildew (baby) each time it consumes 1,200 lbs of organic matter.

###### Spoils

A destroyed mustard mold can be harvested with the following component:

* dried spores (4/6 st, 38gp, *bloody flux, cloud of poison, cure disease, delay disease*)

### Morlock

Morlocks are cannibalistic humanoids that dwell in the underdark below Aurëpos. The Tower of Knowledge had long claimed that morlocks were mythical boogeymen of dwarvish folklore, until in 241 I.Y. morlocks breached the salt mines of Alakyrum and slaughtered hundreds.

Based on interrogation of morlocks captured during the reclamation of the mines, sages came to understand that the creatures were actually the descendants of human beings who fled underground to hide from the destruction of the Day Without Night. In the thousands of years since that cataclysm, they have degenerated into a race of twisted albinos with pale eyes that are nearly blind in bright light, but see with perfect clarity in total darkness.

They rarely venture to the surface, and then only at night. They are most often encountered by dwarves, gnomes, and neanderthals who dwell below ground. Morlocks seem to have a deep-seated hatred for these races, seeing them as interlopers into an underdark that is rightfully theirs.

###### Combat

Morlocks have **lightless vision** to a 90’ range, but suffer from **light sensitivity**. If caught in bright daylight or *perpetual illumination* they suffer an attack penalty of -2.

50% of morlock warrior will be equipped with spears and hide armor, while 50% will be equipped with 3 javelins, hand axes, and shields.

They are automatically Hostile to dwarves, gnomes, and neanderthals, and attack immediately.

###### Ecology

Each morlock gang will be led by a champion with 2 AC, 1+1 HD, and 8 hp. Each morlock warband will be led by a sub-chieftain with 3 AC, 2 HD, 12 hp, and a +1 damage bonus. A morlock village will be led by a chieftain with 4 AC, 3 HD, 15 hp, and a +2 damage bonus.

Morlock lairs and vaults will have drudges and whelps equal to 200% and 200% of the number of warriors, respectively. Morlock drudges fight as kobolds. Morlock whelps have AC 0, Spd 90’, 1hp, ML -4, and do not fight.

When morlocks are encountered in a vault, certain additional creatures will be present. There is a 50% chance for 1d10 enslaved captives per warband. There is a 75% chance a morlock vault will be guarded by 3d6 cave gorillas.

###### Spoils

A slain morlock can be harvested with Healing 1 for the following component useful in magic research:

### Mummy

Chthonic theology teaches that mortals who die are doomed to oblivion unless they preserve their soul and body together with necromantic magic until the time of the Awakening, when the slumbering gods will rouse and restore the faithful to endless life. A mummy is an undead monster created to await the Awakening, the spirit of the dead human or demi-human necromantically bound to and animating its own preserved corpse.

###### Combat

Mummies have a **horrific** **visage**. When a creature first beholds one or more mummies, and at the start of each round thereafter that it continues to do so, the creature must make a Paralysis saving throw. The save suffers a -1 penalty per additional mummy after the first. If the save fails, the creature is **cowering** until the start of the next round. If the save succeeds, the creature gains immunity to the effects of every mummy’s horrific visage for 1 turn.

Mummies attack with great blows of preternatural strength that deal 1d12 {B!} {N!} damage. Any creature damaged by a mummy’s attack starts **rotting**. Rotting creatures gradually begin to bruise, bleed from their orifices, and slough off hair and skin. They take 1 {N!} damage at dusk each day and cannot benefit from magical healing until the condition ends. Mummy rot can be cured with *cure disease* or temporarily halted with *delay disease*.

Exceptionally powerful magic is used to preserve mummies from the effects of age, mold, and rot. As a result, mummies are **immune** to enchantment effects, to necrotic and poisonous damage, and to mundane acidic, bludgeoning, cold, electric, piercing, seismic, and slashing damage. They are **resistant** to mundane fire damage and to extraordinary acidic, bludgeoning, cold, electric, piercing, seismic, and slashing damage. Extraordinary fire damage and mundane or extraordinary luminous damage have full effect. As undead, mummies are inherently evil for purposes of *discern evil*and *holy circle*spells. They are, of course, rebuked as mummies.

###### Ecology

Mummies once slumbered in every tomb of old Zahar. During the Empyrean War, most were destroyed but some still linger on in the undiscovered tombs and lost ruins of that fell kingdom. In Celdorea, Kemesh, and some parts of Opelenea and Somirea, the Chthonic cults still flourish, and the ranks of the undead continue to grow, even as the Awakening looms.

There is a 10% chance a mummy is infested with 1d10+5 sepulchral worms. In tombs of Dirgion worshippers, this chance may rise to 90%.

###### Spoils

A destroyed mummy can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the following components useful in magic research:

### Mummy Lord

Mummy lords are long-dead kings, high lords and sorcerers transformed by necromantic arts into powerful undead. To guarantee the mummy lord’s survival until the time of the Awakening, special sorceries are used to bind their souls not just to their bodies, but to canopic vessels which contain their preserved vital organs.

###### Combat

Mummy lords possess the proficiencies and special abilities of the characters they were in life – usually crusaders, fighters, mages, priestesses, or ruinguards of 11th level or higher.

Like all mummies, mummy lords have a **horrific** **visage**. When a creature first beholds one or more mummies, and at the start of each round thereafter that it continues to do so, the creature must make a Paralysis saving throw. The save suffers a -1 penalty per additional mummy after the first. If the save fails, the creature is **cowering** until the start of the next round. If the save succeeds, the creature gains immunity to the effects of every mummy’s horrific visage for 1 turn.

The evil rituals used to create mummy lords imbue the monsters with the spell-like abilities to **bestow curse**and **bewitch humanoid** at will, **summon insect plague**once per day, and **summon weather**once per week.

Like mummies, mummy lords can attack with great blows of preternatural strength that deal 1d12 {B!} {N!} damage. However, the tomb of a mummy lord is always well-appointed with grave goods, and if the monster was a warrior in life, its **weapons and armor** will be available for the mummy lord’s use. If armored, increase the mummy lord’s AC  by the value of any armor or shield equipped. If armed, mummy lords deal extraordinary damage by weapon +4 (plus any fighter damage bonus, where appropriate). The weapons deal {N!} damage in addition to their damage type.

Any creature damaged by a mummy lord’s attack (slam or weapon) starts **rotting**. Rotting creatures gradually begin to bruise, bleed from their orifices, and slough off hair and skin. They take 1 {N!} damage at dusk each day and cannot benefit from magical healing until the condition ends. The condition ends when the creature dies or when the rot is cured with *cure disease*.

Exceptionally powerful magic is used to preserve mummy lords from the effects of age, mold, and rot. As a result, mummies are **immune** to enchantment effects, to necrotic and poisonous damage, and to mundane acidic, bludgeoning, cold, electric, piercing, seismic, and slashing damage. They are **resistant** to mundane fire damage and to extraordinary acidic, bludgeoning, cold, electric, piercing, seismic, and slashing damage. Extraordinary fire damage and mundane or extraordinary luminous damage have full effect.

When a mummy lord is reduced to zero hit points (or otherwise physically destroyed), its disembodied spirit returns to the **canopic jar** containing its organs, while its body instantly breaks apart into an **insect swarm**. The swarm will be 30' × 30' in size, centered on the point where the mummy lord’s body was destroyed. The swarm immediately inflicts 2 extraordinary necrotic piercing damage to any creature engulfed, or double that to unarmored creatures. The swarm cannot be damaged, but disperses at the end of the next round.

The insects will converge on the mummy lord’s tomb 1d10 nights later, where they re-form the mummy lord’s body. The monster’s disembodied spirit then re-takes possession of its body, at full hit points. However, if the tomb is utterly sealed against insects (possible only through magic) then its body cannot re-form; and if the mummy lord’s canopic jar is removed from its tomb, it cannot re-take possession of its body. A mummy lord can only be permanently destroyed if its canopic jar is destroyed, either before the mummy lord’s body is destroyed or while its disembodied spirit is within the canopic jar.

As undead, mummy lords are inherently evil for purposes of *discern evil*and *holy circle*spells. They are rebuked as vampires, but can make a Spells saving throw to resist the effects.

###### Ecology

Mummy lord lairs are typically guarded by lesser undead, including 1d12 mummies and either 4d6 zombies or 3d10 skeletons. Their canopic jars are kept well-hidden and protected by mundane and magical traps.

A mummy lord has a 10% chance to be infested with 1d10+5 sepulchral worms, or a 90% chance if it worships Dirgion.

###### Spoils

A destroyed mummy lord can be harvested with Healing 2 for:

* canopic organs (14 st., 840gp, *death ward, summon insect plague, summon weather, soul swap*)
* dried skin (14 st., 840gp, *necromantic invulnerability, necromantic potence, physical invulnerability (all), energy invulnerability (all but fire, luminous)*)
* eyes (14 st., 840gp, *bewitch humanoid, cone of fear, frighten humanoid, panic*)
* hands (14 st., 840gp, *cause disease, ogre strength, withering touch*)
* wrappings (14 st., 840gp, *bestow curse, energy protection (cold)*)

###### Encounter

A mile wide by 600’ deep gorge cuts through the landscape here. Cut into the east face of the gorge is an elaborately carved cliff tomb, set about 350’ up from the bottom. In the antechamber, **14 skeletons** with bronze shields and sickle swords wait in wall graves. A tunnel leads from the antechamber to the main tomb, dominated by an 18’ long, 8’ wide stone sarcophagus in its center, carved in effigy of Tizar, and bearing cuneiforms detailing his name and achievements. Within is the ancient sorcerer-king himself, now a mummy lord. Annexed to the main tomb are four servant tombs, with 4 **mummies** total. The whole area is a **shadowed sinkhole of evil**(see ***ACKS II JJ***,p. 252).

Tizar’s grave goods are kept in a secret vault behind a well-concealed door (-4 to Search throws). Scattered across the vault are 4,000ep, 4,000gp, and 1,000pp. Amidst the coin is a stoppered clay pot holding a sweet red fluid (*potion of flight*) and another containing a bone-white fluid (*potion of cure light injury*). In the corner lies a wooden chest containing a crown of pure gold inlaid with flawless diamonds (30,000gp); a portrait mask made of gold sheets inlaid with lapis lazuli (8,000gp); a large wrought gold fan with giant hawk feathers (6,000gp); a dagger of pure gold, its serpent-shaped grip inlaid with eyes of jacinth (6,000gp); and three rolled papyrus scrolls, all written in ancient Zaharan (*scroll of magic warding, scroll of undead legion,* and *scroll of fireball and thunderbolt*). Adjacent to the chest is a tall cedar case with trophies of Tizar’s many victories: an iron sickle sword graven with Zaharan cuneiforms (*short sword +1*); a red-bronze Argollëan sword with a pattern that seems to flicker in the light (*sword +1*, *flamebrand*); a hepatizon kopis inscribed with cuneiforms of anti-magic (*sword +1, +2 v. spellcasters*); and an orichalcum short sword with an eagle-winged crossguard (*short sword +2*).

**Tizar, Mummy Lord:** Int 17, Cha 16; MV 120’, AC 8, HD 13\*\*\*\*, hp 60, #AT 1 (touch or weapon 1+), Dmg 1d12 {N!} {B!} or by weapon +4 + mummy rot, Save F13, ML +4, AL C, XP 5,400; Special: fearsome visage (save v. Paralysis or cower), hard to kill (disperse into *insect plague* at 0hp), mummy rot, mummy lord immunities; Proficiencies: Battle Magic, Black Lore of Zahar, Elementalism (fire); Spells: 4 1st, 4 2nd, 4 3rd, 3 4th, 3 5th, 2 6th; Repertoire: 1st –*arcane armor, choking grip, discern magic, fan of flames, mage missile, slicing blow;* 2nd – *arcane lock, bloody flux, deathless minion, illusory duplicates, necromantic potence, wizard lock;* 3rd –*dismember, dispel magic, fireball, rune of warding, speak with dead, spellward;* 4th – *animate undead, cloud of poison, giant strength, indiscernibility, scry;* 5th – *carnage, conjure supreme elemental, contact other sphere, fillet and serve, rouse the fallen;* 6th – *conflagration, greater sphere of invulnerability, torpor, wall of corpses*

The mummy lord’s canopic organs (700gp, 11 4/6 st) are special components, as are his dried skin, eyes, hands, and wrappings (600gp, 10 st each). Each other mummies’ right hands (260gp, 4 3/6 st each) and wrappings (200gp, 3 2/6 st each) are also special components, as are the skeletons’ skulls (13gp, 1/6 st each).

### Nathaghol (Glintersnatch)

In the tombs of the great sorcerers of ancient Zahar, as well as in the silent vaults of their paramours and valued servants, great gleaming treasure hoards were buried by the sides of the butchered slaves who bore them deep into the gloom and darkness. There these treasures were to remain, sealed within until the bleak re-birth of the dead foretold by the Zaharan Deathspeakers and Eunuch-Priests. But, as in every land and every time, the lure and lay of this buried wealth proved too great for the greedy, the foolhardy, the heedless, the desperate, and the foolish to resist. A frightful fate awaited those caught trespassing in the tombs of the Zaharans – transformation into a nathaghol. The grisly punishment, laid down by the followers of Kaleth and Ravanor, only bolstered the grim reputation of Zahar as a wellspring of malice, cruelty, and sadistic cunning.

The nathaghol, sometimes called glintersnatches in the common tongue of the Auran Empire, linger to this day in crumbling vaults and lost, forsaken places. Sentenced to deathlessness for their crimes of avarice against Zahar, these warped aberrations now use the greed of ages to lure others into death.

At one time a nathaghol was humanoid, but now it is nothing near. A lidless, eyeless face sniffs vainly in the darkness, with flensed flesh peeled back from its gaping mouth and nose. A now-distended jaw allows for the unnatural feeding of coins and jewels into the creature’s blackened, snaggle-toothed maw. Flayed and oozing skin hugs tightly to cracked and oddly angled bones that creak and whine even as the abomination shuffles along in a hunched, awkward, unnatural gait. A wheezing, unholy breath resembling the sound of shifting coins in an overfull sack sounds balefully when the monster becomes excited or exerts itself.

###### Combat

Nathaghol possess a dreadful strength and an awful cunning, and these creatures can **climb, hide**, and **sneak** as 7th level thieves. They can cast **locate object** at will, but only to locate coins, gems, jewelry, or magical items.

Nathaghol **hunger for coins, gems, jewelry, and magical items.** Oftentimes they suckle, chew, and swallow such items they happen upon, which then work their way euphorically yet painfully through the nathaghol’s body in 1d4 turns, dropping beneath them as it passes through. If they ingest a gem, piece of jewelry, or small magical item, they **regenerate** 3 hit points per round for as long as the item works through its body.

A nathaghol lacks the standard senses of living or even undead creatures. It can only “see” or “smell” beings carrying wealth – coins, gems, jewelry, or magical items.

Even silver thread or a gold button will be sniffed out by the nathaghol and rouse its unnatural hunger. However, a creature carrying no treasure at all is invisible to a nathaghol and typically irrelevant to it.

Once per day the nathaghol can use a full-round action to physically **tear open its own belly** to retrieve a previously swallowed bit of treasure. It can then place the recovered coin, gem, or jewel in a desired location or hurl it at a target or spot. The time spent in the nathaghol’s belly gives the treasure a dark and powerful **curse**.

Any living creature within 60’ who gazes upon the cursed treasure must make a Spells saving throw. If the save succeeds, the creature is not affected by the treasure’s curse. If the save fails, the creature is overcome with a selfish, cruel, and ravenous desire to possess the cursed treasure. An affected creature with rivals for the treasure will scheme, fight, or even kill their erstwhile friends to gain the precious treasure. An affected creature with no remaining rivals will take a full-round action to swallow the treasure. When ingested, the cursed wealth turns to acid in the creature’s belly, deals 6d6 extraordinary acidic damage and destroying the treasure.

The first time each day a nathaghol takes slashing damage, 1d6 **cursed pieces of treasure fall from its body** in a jingling clatter. When this occurs, each living creature within 60’must make a number of saving throws equal to the number of coins falling from the wound, with effects as above.

A nathaghol’s treasure remains **cursed** and dangerous from the time it leaves their body until the rising of the next dawn. A *remove curse* cast on the treasure or affected creature cleanses it, as does completely submerging the treasure in holy water for one round.

As undead, nathaghol are **immune** to enchantment effects, necrotic damage, and poisonous damage. They are inherently evil for purposes of *discern evil*and *holy circle*spells. They are rebuked as vampires.

###### Ecology

Nathaghol are found only in the ancient catacombs, crypts, and tombs of the ancient Zaharans.

###### Spoils

A destroyed nathaghol can be harvested with Healing 2 for:

* brain (10 st., 600gp, *locate objects, locate distant object*)

### Neanderthal

Strange throwbacks to an aeon so distant that even the Day Without Night seems recent in comparison, these humanoids are the savage cousins to humans. They measure about 6’6” tall and weigh around 220 lbs. Their faces have large brow ridges, huge dark eyes, snub noses, large fangs, and receding chins, while their bodies are bulky and hirsute. Neanderthals are found only in the deepest caves of the Jutting and Meniri Mountains and the darkest jungles of Ulrukan.

Neanderthals revere cave bears as symbols of courage and prowess. Young neanderthals must hunt cave bears during their tribal rites of passage, while chieftains typically lead a cave bear hunt annually for religious purposes. They despise beastmen and morlocks, and kill them on sight.

Despite their primitive lifestyle, neanderthals are as intelligent as humans. They speak their own language, which mixes animalistic growls and roars with human vocalizations. Chiefs, shamans, and witch doctors have a 50% chance to speak the language of the local humans in the area.

###### Combat

Neanderthals are **formidable warriors** and gain a +1 damage bonus. 50% of neanderthal warriors are equipped with hide armor, spear, and hand axe. The remaining 50% are equipped with hide armor, bola, and club.

###### Ecology

Each neanderthal band will be led by a champion with 2 AC, 3 HD, and 15 hp. A neanderthal lair will be ruled by a strong, cunning chieftain with AC 3, 6 HD, and a +2 damage bonus. As long as the chieftain is alive, the neanderthals will gain a +2 bonus to morale rolls.

Neanderthal lairs will have noncombatants (adolescent, disabled, elderly, nursing, or pregnant) and children equal to 200% and 200% of the number of warriors, respectively. Neanderthal noncombatants have Spd 120’, 0 AC, 1 HD, and ML -2. If forced to fight, they attack with clubs or stones (1d4 {B}). Neanderthal children have Spd 90’, 0 AC, 1hp, ML -4, and do not fight.

If neanderthals are encountered in a wilderness lair, there is a 75% chance the lair will be protected by 3d6 trained cave gorillas.

###### Spoils

A slain neanderthal can be harvested with XXX for the following component useful in magic research:

### Necropede

A necropede is a terrible abomination, the necromantic fusion of multiple humanoid torsos, stitched in-line, the creation's many arms serving as legs, propelling the foul thing swiftly across all manner of terrain, and even up walls and cliffs.

Most necropedes are constructed using six torsos, but can be made with as few as two or as many as a dozen. They have 1 HD per torso and one attack per two torsos.

###### Combat

In combat, the necropede slams into its target with its many arms, seeking to grasp it firmly and crush the life out of it. If the necropede hits a creature smaller than itself with at least two slams in the same attack routine, the creature must make a size-adjusted Paralysis saving throw. If the save fails, the creature is **grabbed**.

Thereafter, while the creature remains grabbed, the necropede can automatically deal 1d8 {B!} damage per attack in its attack routine on its initiative each round to the grabbed creature without having to make an attack throw. Doing so counts as the necropede’s full attack routine.

As undead, necropedes are immune to enchantment effects and poisonous damage. They are inherently evil for purposes of *discern evil*and *holy circle*spells. They are rebuked as specters.

###### Ecology

As undead constructs, necropedes have no natural habitat. They are usually found serving powerful necromancers or lingering in the abandoned ruins of ancient and evil civilizations.

###### Spoils

A destroyed necropede can be harvested with Healing 2 for the following components useful in magic research:

* head (5 5/6 st., 290gp*, deathless minion, unliving puppet, wall of corpses*)
* upper arms (4 st., 240gp, *choking grip, iron maiden*)
* lower arms (4 st., 240gp, *spider climb, swift strike*)

###### Encounter

The Auran Empire constructs hospitals in the countryside where the sick can be cared for without risk of contagion to settled areas. One such hospital is nestled in a dell here. The hospital is 75’ square, with an inner and outer ring of rooms connected to each other by an arcade. The rooms along the arcade were once wards, dormitories, and closets. All contain grisly evidence of terrible experiments. The beds have been fitted with leather straps, and show great tears and rents; most are black with blood. Blood-stained surgical tools, including bone chisels, surgical saws, scalpels, sharp hooks, and rolls of flax thread, are piled in a gory heap in a corner closet.

The arcade surrounds a 25’ square interior courtyard open to the sky. At its center a white marble statue of Mityara has fallen and shattered. Around the statue, a garden has grown wild with weeds and shrubs. Here lurk the hideous experiments, a **pair of necropedes.**

### Nymph, Dryad

Shy, intelligent, and resolute, dryads are a race of nymphs as elusive as they are alluring. The dryad’s delicate features resemble those of a beautiful elven woman, though her flesh is the color of bark, and her hair is the color of a canopy of leaves that changes color with the seasons.

Dryads are found in the forests of southern Aurëpos, particularly in Nicea, Krysea, Southern Argollë, and Tirenea. They are very rare in the north, where faeries rather than nymphs reign.

Perhaps because their first interaction with mankind came in Nicea, most dryads speak Classical Nicean as well as the local dialect of their region. They do not have their own language.

###### Combat

Each dryad is **spiritually united** with a particular tree, and lives her life in or near it. As an action in lieu of moving, a dryad can disappear into her tree by touching it; while within her tree, the dryad cannot be harmed, though her tree can be. She can take one small or man-sized creature into her tree with her, if desired. If a dryad is ever more than 720’ from her tree, she loses 1d3 hp per round until she dies or moves back in range. If a dryad’s tree dies, the dryad will die with it.

A dryad can use **bewitch humanoid**at will as a spell-like ability. The effect is identical to that of the spell except that it has a duration of 12 months. They will use this ability to defend their trees from aggressors and, occasionally, to find mates.

If a dryad successfully bewitchesan elven or human man with a CHA score of 16+, the dryad will beckon the hapless victim to join her at her tree. Once the bewitched fool is within 5’, the dryad will disappear into her tree, taking him with her. Such men are never seen again. Not even a *miracle* or *wish* can rescue the victim. (Perhaps he doesn’t want to be rescued?)

###### Ecology

Since dryads never stray from their tree, the lair roll actually determines whether the dryad dwells alone or dwells in a grove with other dryads. Groves of dryads often accumulate treasure from past victims or infatuations, and store underground below the tree’s roots.

The trees of dryads reproduce according to their nature, dropping seeds that are carried off by wind and water. However, not every tree born of these seeds gives birth to a dryad; only if the dryad has bewitched a mate will the new sapling contain a new dryad’s spirit. The young dryads that dwell in such saplings are rarely seen, as they stay in their trees.

###### Spoils

A dryad corpse can be harvested with Healing 1 for the following components useful in magic research:

* hair (2/6 st, 15gp, *allure, bewitch humanoid, enslave humanoid*)
* heartwood (2/6 st, 15gp, *plant growth, speak with plants*)

### Nymph, Naiad

Naiads are water nymphs that appear as beautiful elf-like women with greenish, bluish, or green-gray skin color. They are similar to dryads in many ways, but much more sociable than the reclusive tree-nymphs. Naiads are found in the rivers, streams, lakes, and ponds of southern Aurëpos, particularly in Nicea, Krysea, Southern Argollë, and Tirenea. They are very rare in the north, where faeries rather than nymphs reign.

Like other nymphs, most naiads speak Classical Nicean as well as the local dialect of their region. They do not have their own language.

###### Combat

Each naiad is **spiritually united** with a particular body of fresh water, such as a lake or river. If a naiad is ever more than 720’ from her home waters, she loses 1d3 hp per round until she dies or moves back in range. If a naiad’s home waters ever dry up, the naiad withers and dies, too.

Like a dryad, a naiad can use **bewitch humanoid**at will as a spell-like ability. The effect is identical to that of the spell except that it has a duration of 12 months. Naiads will use their bewitchment to defend themselves from opponents where necessary – and to enthrall mates where possible.

Should a naiad successfully bewitchan elven or human man with a CHA score of 16+, the naiad will beckon the hapless victim to join her in a life under the sea. Fortunately for the victim, naiads can grant *water breathing* at will as a spell-like ability, with a duration of 24 hours. Naiads generally release their victims after mating, though some men find it better down where it’s wetter and chose to stay.

If bewitchment fails to halt intruders, naiads will retreat into their home waters, where each naiad can call on the aid of a pet **giant lake- or river-fish**. (Use the characteristics of a giant piranha but with ML 0 and no frenzy.) If all else fails, naiads will defend themselves in melee with tiny daggers made of sea-shells and coral.

###### Ecology

Since naiads never stray from their home waters, the lair roll actually determines whether the naiad dwells alone or dwells in a school with other naiads.

Naiads live long lives of eternal youth, and typically give birth to just one child in that time, always in union with a betwitched mate. There is a 7% chance for each naiad encountered to be rearing a young naiad. Roll 1d4 to determine her age: 1, she’s a baby naiad; 2-4, she’s a juvenile naiad. Baby and juvenile naiads both have AC 0, Spd 90’, 1 hp, ML -4, and do not fight. Neither juveniles nor babies have spell-like abilities.

###### Spoils

A naiad corpse can be harvested with Healing 1 for the following components useful in magic research:

* gills (10 per 1 st., 6gp, *bewitch beasts, swimming, water breathing*)
* tears (10 per 1 st., 6gp, *allure, bewitch humanoid, enslave humanoid*)

### Nymph, Oread

The nymphs of the mountains, oreads roam the forests of their rocky homes, hunting such wild beasts as take their fancy, exulting in the chase. When not hunting, oreads dwell in cavernous lairs in the high peaks, often accessible only by magic.

Like all nymphs, they resemble stunning, elf-like women, though their skin is like finely polished stone and their eyes the colors of brilliant gemstones.

Oreads are found in the Achaean, Drakonir, and Meniri Mountains of southern Aurëpos. They are very rarely found in the Jutting Mountains, as faeries rather than nymphs dominate that region.

Like other nymphs, most oreads speak Classical Nicean as well as the local dialect of their region. They do not have their own language.

###### Combat

Oreads are **keen hunters** with two ranks of Survival and Tracking proficiency. They gain a +1 damage bonus when using weapons. They wear leather armor and carry spears and shortbows, with which they are **precise shots**. They deal extraordinary damage with these weapons.

In order to access their cavern lairs, oreads can cast **passageway**as a spell-like ability at will. However, they can only pass through unworked earth, rock, or stone.

Oreads can use **bewitch humanoid**at will as a spell-like ability. The effect is identical to that of the spell except that it has a duration of 12 months. Oreads are not as inclined to use this ability as other nymphs. However, should an oread encounter an elven or human character who is a skilled hunter (Judge’s discretion), she will attempt to bewitch him into being her mate. Like naiads, oreads generally release their victims after mating.

###### Ecology

Unlike other nymphs, oreads are not bound to a specific locale. Thus they can be encountered as wandering monsters far from their lair. Those lucky enough to find their lairs find they often contain metals, minerals, and fine furs kept as hunting trophies.

Oreads enjoy ageless longevity, and typically give birth to just one child in their life, always in union with a betwitched mate. There is a 7% chance for each oread encountered in a lair to be rearing a young naiad. Roll 1d4 to determine her age: 1, she’s a baby oread; 2-4, she’s a juvenile oread. Juvenile oreads have AC 0, Spd 90’, 1 HD, and attack with a dagger or other tiny weapon (1d4 {W}). Baby oreads have AC 0, Spd 90’, 1 hp, ML -4, and do not fight. Neither juveniles nor babies have spell-like abilities.

### Octopus, Giant

The giant octopus is an aggressive and territorial ambush predator that lives in the warm southern waters of the Ammas Aurë as well as along the coast of western and eastern Ulruk. A giant octopus can measure up to 6’ long with 12’ tentacles and weigh up to 600 lbs. Giant octopodes are quite clever, indeed semi-sapient, but disinterested in training. They are rarely tamed and trained, though occasionally undersea races such as tritons might do so.

###### Combat

Giant octopodes have **acute olfaction** granting them a +1 bonus to avoid surprise in their native habitat. Their fluid-filled statocysts grant them **aquatic mechanoreception** that enables them to “see” underwater to a range of 270’ (p. XX).

A giant octopus can change the color of its skin to blend with rocks, coral, or seaweed; flatten itself against surfaces or contort itself to resemble plants or rocks; and even adjust the texture of its skin. Such traits make it a **superb hider** (equivalent to a 14th level thief).

It can attack creatures within 5’ with its beak and within 10’ with its tentacles. A successful hit with a tentacle deals 1d3 bludgeoning damage and **restrains** the creature (p. XX). While a creature is restrained by a tentacle, the octopus can automatically deal 1d2 {B!} damage on its initiative each round to the restrained creature without having to make an attack throw. Doing so counts as the octopus’s attack with that tentacle. A restrained creature can escape by breaking free, slipping free, or cutting off the tentacle. To cut off a tentacle, an attack must deal 6 {S} damage or more to it in one blow. Any damage dealt beyond the required amount is not dealt to the octopus (the tentacle was severed).

Once per day, a giant octopus can use its combat action to create a 30' radius **cloud of black ink** around itself. The ink has the effect of a *tenebrosity* spell but it disperses into the water after 1 turn. On its first initiative after creating ink, an octopus can use a **jet of water** to propel itself at triple its swimming speed.

###### Ecology

Giant octopi reproduce only once in their lifetime and intensively care for their offspring. The female deposits a gelatinous egg mass on to a hard surface, and then stays with the mass until the eggs hatch. Anytime a nest of giant octopi is encountered, the octopi will be guarding one egg mass. Giant octopi egg masses have 1 hp and weigh 1 st.

###### Spoils

### Ogre

Ogres stand 9' to 10' tall and weigh around 800 lbs, resembling big, brutish, hairy humans. They are thought to have been bred from carnivorous apes and hill giants for use as heavy infantry during the Empyrean War that toppled the Kingdom of Zahar. They are the largest humanoids in existence, with larger creatures deemed to be giants. Ogre skin ranges from dull yellow to dull brown and is very hairy. Ogres usually live under rock shelters or in caves, but often will venture into dungeons.

###### Combat

Ogres have **tough hides**, granting them a +3 bonus to AC. They can fight with their fists, dealing 1d10 bludgeoning damage, or with weapons, dealing damage by weapon with a +3 bonus due to their great strength. Most ogre warriors are equipped with fur and hide armor and large two-handed weapons such as morning stars or great axes.

When smashing with piercing or slashing weapons, ogres deliver **vicious blows** that deal an additional 2 points per smash (for a total of +5). When armed with a bludgeoning weapons, ogres can **topple** man-sized or smaller creatures with every attack. A small or man-sized creature struck by an ogre’s swing must make a Paralysis saving throw. If the save fails, the creature takes damage and is knocked prone. If the save succeeds, the creatures take damage but stays on its feet. The ogre can cleave if the creature fails its save against his smash.

###### Ecology

Each ogre gang will be led by a champion with 5 AC, 5+1 HD, 33 hp, and a +4 damage bonus. Each ogre warband will be led by a sub-chieftain with 6 AC, 6+1 HD, 37 hp, and a +5 damage bonus. An ogre lair or village will be led by a chieftain with 7 AC, 8+2 HD, 45 hp, and a +5 damage bonus. As long as the chieftain is alive, the ogres will gain a +2 bonus to morale rolls.

When ogres are encountered in a village, certain additional creatures may be present. Ogre villages will have 2d6 drudges and 2d4 whelps for every 10 ogres. Ogre drudges fight as bugbears, while ogre whelps fight as goblins. There is a 50% chance for 1d10 enslaved captives per warband. In addition, an ogre village has a 50% chance of a shaman being present, and a 25% chance of a witch doctor. A shaman is equivalent to a sub-chieftain statistically, but has the abilities of a shaman of level 1d4. A witch doctor is equivalent to a champion, but has the abilities of a mage of level 1d2.

###### Spoils

When ogres are found away from their lair they will carry sacks containing 1d6x100gp each.

A slain ogre can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 2 for the following component useful in magic research:

### Ooze, Ochre

The ochre ooze is a slimy giant amoeba around 20’ in diameter and 10,000 lbs in weight. Its distinct golden-yellow hue glistens sickeningly in torchlight. Ochre ooze mindlessly slowly oozes through its environment to consume everything in its path. It can crawl along floors, walls, and ceilings with equal ease, undulate through water, and can ooze through tiny fissures in stone or narrow gaps in doorways.

###### Combat

Ochre oozes have **terrestrial mechanoreception** enabling them to sense vibration in the ground over long distances equivalent to line of sight in full daylight.

An ochre ooze is **immune** to enchantment effects and to acidic, arcane, bludgeoning, electrical, luminous, necrotic, piercing, poisonous, seismic, and slashing damage. Only cold and fire can truly harm an ochre ooze, but certain other damage types can affect it temporarily:

* If hit by electrical damage, the ochre ooze will be **paralyzed** for one round per die of damage the attack would normally deal.
* If hit by seismic damage, the ochre ooze be blown apart and seemingly destroyed, only to reform unharmed at the start of its next initiative.
* If hit by slashing damage, the ochre ooze will be divided into 1d3+2 smaller oozes. The Judge can divide the original ooze’s Hit Dice and current hp between the smaller oozes however he sees fit, with the limitation that no ochre ooze can have fewer than 1 Hit Dice. An ooze with 1 HD only deals 1d3 extraordinary acidic damage, an ooze with 2 HD deals 1d6, and an ooze with 3 – 4 HD deals 2d4. An ochre ooze of 1 HD treats slashing damage as seismic damage. The ochre oozes can merge back into one blob as a full-round action. Oozes that merge add their current hp together.

An ochre ooze deals 2d6 {A!} damage and can digest cloth, wood, and leather, but not metal or stone. Any creature reduced to 0 hp or fewer by an ochre ooze is immediately slain and its body dissolved.

###### Ecology

Ochre oozes can be found anywhere there is organic matter for them to feed on, but are most common in stone dungeons, whose confines become their feeding grounds.

An ochre ooze reproduces by budding, detaching a newborn ochre oops (baby) each time it consumes 10,000 lbs of organic matter.

###### Spoils

A destroyed ochre ooze can be harvested with Alchemy for the following component useful in magic research:

* burnt or frozen remnants (6 1/6 st, 500gp, *illusory duplicates, rain of vitriol, shrinking, vitriolic infusion, warp wood*)

### Ostrich

The ostrich is a large flightless bird that stands around 8’ tall and weighs around 275 lbs. Its plumage is predominantly black with striking white plumes on the wings and tail. They are curious, playful creatures but can be highly territorial and aggressive towards perceived intruders.

Ostriches are most common in the savannas of Ulruk, but can also be found in the southern reaches of the Sunset Kingdoms and the Zaharan Waste.

###### Combat

Ostriches have strong kicks capable of injuring or killing lions and hyenas, but their beaks are adapted for grasping and swallowing rather than fight.

###### Ecology

When an ostrich nest is encountered, there is a 25% chance each ostrich is rearing offspring. If so, roll 1d4 for age and number: 1, it’s 1d6+5 eggs; 3-8 it’s 1d4+1 juveniles. Juvenile ostriches have AC 2, Spd 210’, 2+1 HD, and attack with 2 kicks (1d2 {B}). Eggs have 1 hp and weigh 2/6 st.

###### Spoils

A slain ostrich with extraordinary characteristics can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) for the following components useful in magic research:

* talons (1 st., 65gp, *avian messenger, swift sword*)

An ostrich’s 6d10 flight feathers each fetch 1d3sp and weigh 1/150 st.

Ostriches can be tamed and trained as hunters, but few trainers find it worthwhile since they are not large enough to serve as mounts. Rumors that a tribe of halflings native to the Ivory Kingdoms has domesticated the ostrich are not considered credible by the Tower of Knowledge.

###### Encounter

The high grass of the savanna conceals a communal nest of **four ostriches**. The flock’s male has dug a hole for his mates to lay their eggs in, where the females take turns incubating the **15 eggs**. The ostriches have no treasure.

**Ostriches (4):** Speed 240’, AC 3, HD 3+2\*, hp 20, 16, 14, 10, #AT 2 (talons 7+), Dmg 1d4 {S} /1d4 {S}, Save F2, ML 0, XP 65

### Ostrich, Giant

The giant ostrich is a flightless bird of great size, a typical specimen standing 10’ tall and weighing 450 lbs. Its plumage is drab gray, except for its colorful throat and head. Its beak is long and vicious and has earned it the moniker “terror bird.”

An atavistic remnant of an era when the reptilian ancestors of birds ruled the world, giant ostriches are rarely seen in Aurëpos. However, adventurers who have explored the vastness of Ulruk claim they are not uncommon there. Some even assert that the tribesmen of Ulruk have domesticated the giant ostrich, and ride the creatures into battle the way civilized men ride horses.

###### Combat

Not only can a giant ostrich tear the flesh of its prey with its axe-like beak, but its clawed feet can deliver a murderous kick. The ostrich’s attacks are vicious that it often **eviscerates** its prey and tears apart its limbs. Any creature reduced to 0 or fewer hp by a terror bird suffers a -4 penalty on its subsequent Mortal Wounds roll.

###### Ecology

When a giant ostrich nest is encountered, there is a 25% chance each ostrich is rearing offspring. If so, roll 1d4 for age and number: 1, it’s 2d10 eggs; 2-4 it’s 1d8 juveniles. Juvenile terror birds have AC 3, Spd 240’, 3 HD, and attack with 2 kicks (1d2 {B}) and bite (1d2 {P}). Eggs have 1 hp and weigh 3/6 st.

###### Spoils

A slain ostrich can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) for the following components useful in magic research:

* beak (5 st, 300gp, *beast growth, dismember,* +1 weapon)
* talons (4 3/6 st., 270gp, *avian messenger, swift sword*)

If not used for magic research, a giant ostrich’s two talons each fetch 4gp and weigh 1/6 st. Its 6d10 flight feathers each fetch 1d6gp and weigh 1/25 st.

Giant ostriches can be tamed and trained, albeit not so easily as dogs or horses. Because of their speed and prowess, they sometimes find use as war mounts in the Sunset Kingdoms.

###### Lore

*To celebrate his triumph at the Battle of Trikala, Ulkyreus sponsored the most spectacular games ever held in Aura. Throughout the summer of 226 IY, the citizens of the Great City thrilled to chariot races, gladiatorial duels, mock battles, epic plays, and public executions. The most famous of these events was a ball game in which teams of riders mounted on so-called “terror birds” scored points by kicking a bronze helmet (representing the head of the defeated Somirean king) through gateways on either end of the Great Arena. The game ended in glorious havoc when one of the giant ostriches leaped into the mezzanine and tore apart a pair of senators before itself being slain. An inquest by the Emperor’s Talons after the event revealed that the senators had been conspiring to assassinate the Tarkaun, and their death was ruled a rightful execution.*

### Owlbeast

Owlbeasts are chaotic crossbreeds with the heads and shoulders of giant horned owls and the torsos and limbs of brown bears. Their coats range in color from brown-black to yellowish brown, with feathers in dun or light grey, while their beaks are a dull ivory color. Their red-rimmed eyes betray a bestial madness born of their unnatural biology. A full-grown owlbeast can stand as tall as 8' and weigh up to 1,500lb.

###### Combat

Mean-spirited and man-eating, owlbeasts are highly aggressive. Characters encountering owlbeasts suffer a -2 penalty to reaction rolls.

Owlbeasts have the **acute vision** of a bird of prey and gain a +1 bonus to avoid surprise in their native habitat. Like grizzly bears, owlbeasts are **skilled climbers**, able to ascend sheer surfaces as if they were thieves (6+).

If an owlbeast successfully attacks the same target with both claws in the same attack routine, it immediately **hugs** the target for an additional 2d8 {B!} damage. If the hug kills the target, the owlbeast can cleave with its claw.

###### Ecology

Owlbeasts dwell in wooded areas, and often make their dens in caves or dungeons. When owlbeasts are encountered in a wilderness den, there is a 66% chance the adults will be rearing owlbeast cubs. Roll 1d4 for age and number: 1-2 it’s 1d3 babies, 3-4 it’s 1d3-1 juveniles. Juvenile owlbeasts have AC 2, Spd 90’, HD 2+2, and attack with two claws (1d3 {S}) and bite (1d3 {P}). Baby owlbeasts have AC 1, Spd 90’, HD 1+2, and attack with 2 scratches (1 {S}) and 1 nibble (1 {P}).

###### Spoils

A slain owlbeast can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the following components useful in magic research:

* claws (3 st, 175gp, *iron maiden,* weapon +1)
* stomach (3 st, 175gp, *slumber,* armor +1)

Though it cannot fly, an owlbeast has 3d10 flight feathers. Each feather fetches 1d6gp and weighs 1 st per 25 feathers. An owlbeast’s hide fetches 100gp and weighs 2 st.

A live owlbeast is also valuable. Despite their aggressive nature, owlbeasts captured young can be readily trained as guard animals by trainers with an appropriately cruel and stern disposition.

###### Encounter

A 100’ tall cedar tree, with great spreading branches, looms taller than the other trees in this grove. A hollow in the base of the great tree is the den of a mated **pair of owlbeasts**.

**Owlbeasts (2):** Spd 120’, AC 4, HD 5, hp 34, 21, #AT 3 (2 claws/bite 6+), Dmg 1d8 {S!} /1d8 {S!} / 1d8 {P!}, Save F3, ML +1, AL C, XP 200; Special: hug (2d8 {B!} if both claws strike in one round)

A bloodstained but otherwise unmarred round Imperial cavalryman’s *shield +1* lies atop some bones in the hollow.

### Pegasus

Magnificent winged horses, the pegasi were made by the Empyrean gods to serve as steeds for the exalted heroes of the Empyrean War. As recently as the reign of Audarius Ulkyreus XI, the Auran Empire fielded elite aerophract cavalry mounted on pegasi. Tragically, the last of the winged steeds died during the civil war that followed the death of Ulkyreus. Today, wild pegasi survive only in the primordial forests of Northern and Southern Argollë and the high peaks of the Meniri and Jutting Mountains.

All pegasi have the conformation and poise of a finely-bred light horse. Their coats and feathers can be cloud white, golden cream, night black, platinum grey, or shimmery silver, while their manes and tails are often pure white but sometimes gold or blood red. A full-grown pegasi has a wingspan of 24’ and a weight of 1,000 lbs.

###### Combat

Pegasi are, like horses, relatively easy to frighten (0 Morale). They can overcome their skittishness through **training for war**. War-trained pegasi gain +2 to morale. The rider of a war-trained pegasi can attack with a charge, dealing double damage dice with a lance, and a war-trained pegasi can attack with its hooves during the charge as well.

Even war-trained pegasi fear hippogriffs, however, which are their natural predators. When hippogriffs are visible, pegasi suffer a -2 penalty to morale rolls, even if the hippogriffs are controlled or ridden by allies.

###### Ecology

When pegasi are encountered in their aerie, there is a 25% chance each pegasi is guarding offspring. Roll 1d4 for number and age: 1, it’s 1d3 eggs, 2-4, it’s 1 juvenile. Juvenile pegasi have AC 1, Spd 180’, HD 1+1, and attack with 1 hoof (1d2 {B}). They cannot fly. Pegasi eggs have 1 hp and weigh 3 st.

The valuable offspring are not easy to claim. Pegasi defending young do not have to make morale rolls; they always fight to the death.

###### Spoils

A slain pegasus can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the following components useful in magic research:

* mane (2/6 st, 20gp, *vigor*)
* wingtips (3/6 st, 27gp, *flight, winged flight*)

A pegasus’ 4d12 flight feathers each fetch 4d6gp and weigh 1/25 st.

### Phoenix

Phoenixes are divine birds who serve as heralds and messengers of Ammonar, lord of law and light. They resemble majestic eagles, but weigh about 200 lbs and measure around 12’ in length with 30’ wingspans. Phoenixes have red and gold plumage characterized by a crest of seven gold feathers that radiate from their heads like sunrays, with eyes of sapphire blue and legs covered in yellow-gold scales with wine-colored talons.

As heralds of the gods, phoenixes speak Common, Classical Auran, and 1d6 other tongues, often ancient or dead languages, along with the screeching tongue of rocs.

###### Combat

Phoenixes have **acute vision** and **alertness**, granting them a +2 bonus to avoid surprise in their natural habitat.

The very sight of a phoenix is a **good omen**. Any Lawful character that beholds a phoenix is protected by a *holy blessing* spell until the phoenix goes out of sight.

The tears of a phoenix have **curative properties**. Once per day, a phoenix can shed a teardrop that can *cure critical wounds, cure disease, neutralize poison,* or *repair disability and disfigurement.* The phoenix will only shed a tear forLawful characters in grave need who achieve Friendly reactions. A phoenix’s teardrop can be stored temporarily if mixed with holy water, but its efficacy fades at sunset.

Phoenixes are peaceful and will only fight to protect Lawful creatures or drive off Chaotic ones. They attack from the air, making a **dive attack** with their talons. A dive attack inflicts double the normal damage (2d6 {S!} /2d6 {S!}). If the phoenix hits a creature smaller than itself with both its talons while making a dive attack, the creature must make a size-adjusted Paralysis saving throw. If the save fails, the creature is **grabbed**.

If a phoenix is reduced to 0 hp, it combusts in a **fiery explosion** that reduces it to ash. Each creature within 30’ of the phoenix’s torso (e.g. within its wingspan) when it explodes must make a Blast saving throw. If the save fails, the creature suffers 4d6 {L!} {F!} damage. If the save succeeds, the creature suffers half that damage.

At the end of the round following the round in which the phoenix explodes, a new phoenix is born from its ashes with full HD and hp. However, if the ashes are collected and placed into a metamphora before the phoenix is reborn, a new phoenix does not spawn and the ash can be used as a special component.

###### Ecology

As incarnations, phoenixes do not age, eat, or reproduce. Most phoenixes soar the heavens, descending from time to time to deliver messages or offer aid to the worthy. Occasionally, however, a phoenix might make a lair, either to create or protect a pinnacle of good or to stand sentry over a sinkhole of evil.

### Rakshasa

Rakshasas are supernatural beings of Chaos sent by the Chthonic gods to bring suffering to the people of Somirea for turning their back on their worship. They delight in destruction and feasting upon the flesh of those who cross them. They particularly enjoy tormenting priests of Law, and actively desecrate graves, tear apart shrines, and otherwise bring ruin to such religious trappings as they encounter.

Ugly, ogre-sized humanoids, rakshasa have black skin, wild red hair, large curving fangs, wicked black claws, and eyes that glow like red embers. Despite this brutal appearance, they are sly, crafty creatures who dress in fine silks and ornaments, and freely associate with others of similarly evil bent, whether leading groups of malevolent intent, or following those more powerful than themselves.

###### Combat

The black claws of rakshasa are **venomous**. Any creature damaged by rakshasa claw must make a successful Death saving throw or die at the end of the rakshasa’s initiative.

Despite lacking wings, rakshasa can fly with great speed. They have a number of powerful **spell-like abilities**, all of which they can use at will: *discern good*, *inaudibility*, *invisibility*, *illusory terrain*, *spectral figment*, and *transform self.* They delight in using their abilities to masquerade as friends and family members of their unsuspecting victims.

Rakshasa are immune to all mundane physical damage and resistant to all mundane energy damage. As unholy beings, they can be detected with *discern evil*, held at bay by *holy circle* and destroyed with *dispel evil.* If summoned, they can be returned to their home spheres by *counterspell* or *dispel magic*.

###### Ecology

Rakshasa have no natural habitat on this sphere of existence. They often lurk in charnel grounds, unholy shrines, and other places of chaos and death, but sometimes reside in the teeming cities of Somirea, where they disguise themselves as ordinary citizens while pursuing their evil agenda.

###### Spoils

A slain rakshasa can be harvested with Alchemy 2 for the following components useful in magic research:

* brain (6 st, 360gp, *discern good*
* eyes (12 st, 720gp, *inaudibility, invisibility*)
* hair (12 st, 720gp, *flight*)
* heart (12 st, 720gp, *illusory terrain, spectral figment*)
* ichor (18 5/6 st., 1,130gp, *adjust self, poison, transform self*)

A rakshasa’s two claws each fetch 12gp and weigh 1/6 st. Its venom (onset time 1 round, +1 saving throw modifier, 10d6 {Po} damage on failed saving throw) fetches 800gp and weighs 1/6 st.

### Raptor, Giant

Raptors are birds of prey renowned throughout Aurëpos for their keen vision, swift dives, and sharp talons. Eagles, falcons, hawks, owls, and vultures are all types of raptor. Giant raptors include the giant teratorns, great elfhawks, and similar birds of impressive size. They weigh about 150 to 175 lbs and measure around 8’ to 11’ in length with 25’ to 30’ wingspans.

###### Combat

Raptors have **acute vision** and **alertness**, granting them a +2 bonus to avoid surprise in their natural habitat.

Their preferred attack is a **dive attack** with their talons. A dive attack inflicts double the normal damage (2d4 {S} / 2d4 {S}). If the raptor hits a creature smaller than itself with both its talons while making a dive attack, the creature must make a size-adjusted Paralysis saving throw. If the save fails, the creature is **grabbed**.

###### Ecology

When giant raptors are encountered in their aerie, there is a 33% chance each raptor is guarding eggs or juveniles. Roll 1d10 for age and number: 1 it’s 1d4 eggs, 2-10 it’s 1d2 juvenile raptors. Juvenile raptors of giant size have AC 1, Spd 30’, HD 1, and 2 talons (1d2 {S}). Giant raptor eggs have 1 hp and weigh 1/6 st.

###### Spoils

A slain giant raptor can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following components useful in magic research:

* tail feathers (1t s, 60gp, *flight, lay of the land*)
* talons (4/6 st, 40gp, *sharpness, striking*)

A giant raptor’s 6d10 flight feathers each fetch 1d6gp and weigh 1/25 st.

Trained giant raptors are commonly used as guards in elven fastnesses.

###### Encounter

Visible on a nearby summit is a colossal humanoid skeleton, over 110’ tall, the remains of some dead titan of antiquity. The petrified skeleton is now the aerie of **three giant raptors**, who have made nests in its bones. The two larger raptors are a mated pair tending a clutch of **four eggs**.

**Giant raptors (3):** Spd 60’ / 450’ fly, AC 2, HD 3+3, hp 20, 18, 11, #AT 2 (talons 7+), Dmg 1d6 {S} / 1d6 {S}, Save F2, ML 0, AL N, XP 65; Special: dive attack

###### Lore

*When Audarius Valerian was appointed Exarch, he mustered the surviving legions of Aura to hear him. “Henceforth, we shall no longer fear Baal,” he proclaimed. “Henceforth, Baal shall fear us.” And he ordered the army due south, intent to offer battle.*

*After several days hard marching, the Aurans came to the Fords of the Petrivor, where Baal’s army had deployed The Exarch’s war council cautioned him against attacking Baal across the river, and he might have heeded them had he not espied, soaring over the Petrivor, a pair of majestic imperial eagles.*

### Rhinoceros, Common

The Tower of Knowledge in Aura once believed that the rhinoceros was a magical crossbreed of a hippopotamus and a unicorn. Explorers and scholars who have journeyed to the Ivory Kingdoms, however, have since proved that the rhinoceros is a natural animal native to Ulruk. This has not dissuaded hunters, who find the rhino’s horns can command a high price in the markets of Shebatea and Opelenea. Measuring 13'9" long and 5'6" tall at shoulder, the mighty herbivore can weigh up to 5,000 lbs.

###### Combat

Characters encountering rhinos suffer a -2 penalty to reaction rolls due to the rhinoceros’ foul temper.

Rhinos prefer to start combat by **charging** with their horn, dealing double damage dice (4d4 {P!}) on a successful charge. After charging, rhinos will attempt to **trample** their opponents. A rhino gains a +4 bonus to attack throws when trampling a small or man-sized creature. If struck, the creature takes damage must make a Paralysis saving throw or be forced aside 10’, landing **prone**. A small creature saves at -6 and a man-sized creature at -4. A rhino can cleave after a successful trample attack that forces aside a creature.

###### Ecology

When rhinos are encountered, there is a 50% chance the adults will be accompanied by 1d4 juvenile rhinos and 1d2 baby rhinos. Juvenile rhinos are large size, have AC 2, Spd 90’, HD 3, and attack by trampling (1d8 {B}). Juvenile rhinos can only take a +4 bonus versus and force aside small creatures, which save at -4. Baby rhinos are man-sized, have AC 1, Spd 90’, HD 2, and attack by stomping (1d3 {B}).

###### Spoils

A slain rhino with exceptional attributes can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following component useful in magic research:

* horn (5 2/6 st, 320gp, *cure disease, discern poison, force of impetus, neutralize poison, striking*, weapon +1)

If not used for magic research, a rhino’s horn fetches 2d2x100gp and weighs 1 st per 450gp value. A rhino’s armored hide fetches 100gp and weighs 13 st.

Rhinos are rarely tamed and trained, though on at least two occasions the Somirean army has used trained war rhinos as shock troops on the field.

### Rhinoceros, Woolly

The woolly rhinoceros is a prehistoric rhino that is larger and covered in a dense, coarse hair. Larger than their cousins, they weigh up to 7,000lbs. Wooly rhinos are not commonly found in Aurëpos, but explorers who have ventured north of the Jutting Mountains claim they still dwell in the vast taiga.

###### Combat

Characters encountering woolly rhinos suffer a -2 penalty to reaction rolls due to the rhinoceros’ foul temper.

Woolly rhinos prefer to start combat by **charging** with their horn, dealing double damage dice (4d6 {P!}) on a successful charge. After charging, wooly rhinos will attempt to **trample** their opponents. A rhino gains a +4 bonus to attack throws when trampling a small or man-sized creature. If struck, the creature takes damage must make a Paralysis saving throw or be forced aside 10’, landing **prone**. A small creature saves at -6 and a man-sized creature at -4. A rhino can cleave after a successful trample attack that forces aside a creature.

###### Ecology

When woolly rhinos are encountered, there is a 50% chance the adults will be accompanied by 1d2 juvenile woollies and 1d2-1 baby woollies. Juvenile woollies are large size, have AC 3, Spd 90’, HD 4, and attack by trampling (1d12 {B}). Juvenile woollies can only take a +4 bonus versus and force aside small creatures, which save at -4. Baby woollies are man-sized, have AC 2, Spd 90’, HD 2+2, and attack by stomping (1d4 {B}).

###### Spoils

A slain woolly rhino can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following component useful in magic research:

* horn (6 stone, 600gp, *cure disease, discern poison, force of impetus, neutralize poison, striking*, weapon +1)

If not used for magic research, a woolly rhino’s horn fetches 3d3x100gp and weighs 1 st per 450gp value. A woolly rhino’s hide weighs 19 st and fetches 140gp if used for armor or 325gp if used for fur.

Wolly rhinos are surly and stupid, and rarely trained.

### Roc, Giant

Rocs are living symbols of the power and majesty of Ammonar, the Winged Sun, Empyrean god of light and law. Giant rocs resemble colossal gold eagles, with golden-brown feathers with a metallic sheen. These awe-inspiring birds are among the largest creatures in the world. Their wings span a titanic 240’ while their enormous bodies weigh around 15,000 lbs.

With lifespans even longer than the elves, gigantic rocs always speak Common, Classical Auran, and 1d6 other tongues, often ancient or dead languages, along with the screeching tongue of their kind.

###### Combat

Rocs have **acute vision** and **alertness**, granting them a +2 bonus to avoid surprise in their natural habitat.

Rocs are inherently lawful creatures. Chaotic characters encountering rocs suffer -2 penalty to reaction rolls, while neutral characters suffer a -1 penalty.

A flying roc can make a **dive attack** with their talons. A dive attack inflicts double the normal damage dice (6d6 {S} / 6d6 {S}). If the roc hits a creature smaller than itself with both its talons while making a dive attack, the creature must make a size-adjusted Paralysis saving throw. If the save fails, the creature is **grabbed**.

###### Ecology

When giant rocs are encountered in their aerie, there is a 15% chance each roc is guarding eggs or juveniles. Roll 1d4 for their number and age: 1-2, it’s 1d3 eggs, 3-4, it’s 1d3-1 juveniles. Juvenile giant rocs have the characteristics of large rocs. Giant roc eggs have 3 hp and weigh 12 st.

Rocs defending their young do not have to make morale rolls; they always fight to the death.

###### Spoils

A giant roc corpse can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the following components useful in magic research:

* beak (75 st, 4500gp, *cataclysm, force of impetus, sharpness, striking*, weapon +2)
* eyes (65 st, 3900gp, *lay of the land, locate distant object, locate place of power, scry*)
* tail feathers (70 st, 4200gp, any air elemental effects, armor +3)

A giant roc’s 6d10 flight feathers each fetch 6d20gp and weigh 1 st. Its two talons each fetch 18gp and weigh 2/6 st.

Although sapient, rocs are difficult to train because of their sheer size, power, and speed. One mistake can cause the would-be roc rider to die.

### Roc, Large

Rocs are living symbols of the power and majesty of Ammonar, the Winged Sun, Empyrean god of light and law. Large rocs resemble gigantic goshawks, with dark grey backs and wings with a pale grey underbelly marked by fine black bands. The wingspan of these mighty birds stretches 110’ while their great bodies weigh around 3,000 lbs.

Wise and long-lived, large rocs almost always have learned to speak both Common and Classical Auran as well as their own screeching tongue. Large rocs are found in the primordial forests of Northern and Southern Argollë and in the high Jutting and Meniri Mountains.

###### Combat

Rocs have **acute vision** and **alertness**, granting them a +2 bonus to avoid surprise in their natural habitat.

Rocs are inherently lawful creatures. Chaotic characters encountering rocs suffer -2 penalty to reaction rolls, while neutral characters suffer a -1 penalty.

A flying roc can make a **dive attack** with their talons. A dive attack inflicts double the normal damage dice (2d8 {S} /2d8 {S}). If the roc hits a creature smaller than itself with both its talons while making a dive attack, the creature must make a size-adjusted Paralysis saving throw. If the save fails, the creature is **grabbed**.

###### Ecology

When large rocs are encountered in their aerie, there is a 15% chance each roc is guarding offspring. Roll 1d4 for their number and age: 1-2, it’s 1d3 eggs, 3-4, it’s 1d3-1 juveniles. Juvenile large rocs have the characteristics of small rocs. Large roc eggs have 1 hp and weigh 1 4/6 st.

###### Spoils

A slain large roc can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the following components useful in magic research:

* beak (15 st, 900gp, *cataclysm, force of impetus, sharpness, striking*, weapon +1)
* eyes (8 st, 480gp, *lay of the land, locate distant object, locate place of power*)
* tail feathers (12 st, 720gp, *circling winds, gale of winds,* armor +2)

A large roc’s 6d10 flight feathers each fetch 7d6gp and weigh 1/4 st. Its two talons each fetch 8gp and weigh 1/6 st.

Although sapient, rocs are difficult to train because of their sheer size, power, and speed. One mistake can cause the would-be roc rider to die.

### Roc, Small

Rocs are living symbols of the power and majesty of Ammonar, the Winged Sun, Empyrean god of light and law. Small rocs resemble gigantic peregrine falcons, with slate-grey backs and wings with a white underbelly marked by fine black bands. Though the smallest of the rocs, their wingspans still extend to 55’ tip-to-tip and their bodies weigh around 800lbs.

Clever and long-lived, small rocs often (65%) speak both Common and Classical Auran as well as their own screeching tongue. Though not common, they can be found throughout the forests and mountains of Aurëpos.

###### Combat

Rocs have **acute vision** and **alertness**, granting them a +2 bonus to avoid surprise in their natural habitat.

Rocs are inherently lawful creatures. Chaotic characters encountering rocs suffer -2 penalty to reaction rolls, while neutral characters suffer a -1 penalty.

A flying roc can make a **dive attack** with their talons. A dive attack inflicts double the normal damage dice (2d6 {S} / 2d6 {S}). If the roc hits a creature smaller than itself with both its talons while making a dive attack, the creature must make a size-adjusted Paralysis saving throw. If the save fails, the creature is **grabbed**.

###### Ecology

When small rocs are encountered in their aerie, there is a 15% chance each roc is guarding offspring. Roll 1d4 for their number and age: 1-2, it’s 1d3 eggs, 3-4, it’s 1d3-1 juveniles. Juvenile small rocs have the characteristics of giant raptors. Small roc eggs have 1 hp and weigh 3/6 st.

Rocs defending their young do not have to make morale rolls; they always fight to the death.

###### Spoils

A slain small rocs can harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the following components useful in magic research:

* beak (4 st, 240gp, *cataclysm, force of impetus, sharpness, striking*)
* eyes (2 st, 120gp, *lay of the land, locate distant object, locate place of power*)
* tail feathers (3 3/6 st, 210gp, *circling winds, gale of winds*)

A small roc’s 6d10 flight feathers each fetch 3d6gp and weigh 1/8 st. A small roc’s two talons each fetch 5gp and weigh 1/6 st.

Although sapient, rocs are difficult to train because of their sheer size, power, and speed. One mistake can cause the would-be roc rider to die.

### Rustbeast

According to popular legend, the first rustbeasts were created by a peace-loving elven wizard who hoped to put an end to wars by destroying the metal that enabled warriors to fight them. Ironically, the wizard was ultimately killed by a crossbow bolt shot by a dwarf angry over the loss of his magic axe to one of the beasts – or so the story goes. Apocryphal as the tale may be, all agree that rusts beasts do in fact have the power to destroy metal they contact.

Adventurers who have encountered rustbeasts describe them as rust-colored crocodile with long scaly tails and strange antennae-like feelers erupting from their snouts. A typical rustbeast measures 5’ long, stands 3’ tall, and weighs 200 lbs.

###### Combat

A rustbeast has **acute olfaction** that is attuned to the scent of metal. It gains a +1 bonus to avoid surprise when encountering creatures equipped with 1 stone or more of metal arms, armor, or coin.

In combat, a rustbeast will engage whichever creatures are carrying the most stones of metal arms, armor, equipment, and coins. When attacking, it can ignore the target’s AC from armor, but not AC from DEX, magic items, natural armor, or spells. If it hits, it destroys a fraction of the metal on the target:

* First, a metal shield carried by the target, if any; then
* A metal weapon carried by the target, if any; then
* Any metal armor worn by the target; then
* Any metal coin or gear on the target (1 st. worth)

Non-magical metal is destroyed automatically. Magical metal is destroyed unless it succeeds on a Death save (use the wearer’s target value, adding any magic bonus if applicable).

If a rustbeast hits a target that is not carrying any metal whatsoever, its attack deals 1d4 {A!} damage. However, it will only attack such targets in retaliation for being attacked. If left unprovoked, it will prefer to feed on the ashes left by its corrosive powers.

If a creature strikes a rustbeast with a metal weapon, the weapon is destroyed, automatically if mundane and on a failed Death save is magical. If the weapon is destroyed, it crumbles to dust before dealing damage to the rust beast.

###### Ecology

When a wilderness den of rustbeasts is encountered, there is a 10% chance per rustbeast that it will be incubating a clutch of 1d4 eggs. The eggs have 1 hp and weight 1/60 st. Rustbeast hatchlings are rarely found in nests, because the hatchlings immediately disperse after they emerge from their eggs.

###### Spoils

A slain rust beast can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the following component useful in magic research:

* antennae (6 st, 350gp, *crafting, disintegration, shatter blade, turn to dust, wall of annihilation*)

Because of their ability to “smell” metal, trained rustbeasts are sometimes used by dwarven excavators to assist them in prospecting for veins of ore, much as pigs are used to find truffles.

### Salamander, Flame

The flame salamander is a kind of intelligent fire elemental. It resembles a giant four-legged lizard with fire red scales. A typical specimen measures 12' to 16' in length and weighs around 1,300 lbs.

Fire salamanders speak their own tongue, which sounds like fire crackling. They virtually never speak any other languages. Frost salamanders and flame salamanders despise one another and will always fight if in the same vicinity.

###### Combat

A flame salamander radiates an **aura of scorching heat** in a 20’ radius**.** Any creature that begins its initiative in, or moves into, the aura suffers 1d8 {F!} damage and must make a Blast saving throw. If the save fails, the creature becomes **dehydrated**. If already dehydrated, it loses 1 CON.

The claws a fire salamander deal 1d6 {F!} {S!} damage, while its bite deals 2d6 extraordinary {F!} {P!} damage.

Flame salamanders are **immune** to enchantment effects, to fire damage and to mundane bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. They can be held at bay by *holy circle.* If summoned, they can bedispelled with *counterspell* or *dispel magic*.

###### Ecology

Flame salamanders are not native to our sphere. They usually arrive in Aurëpos by summoning magic or through a portal created at a furnace of elemental fire. Once they arrive in our world, flame salamanders often take up residence in the molten lava of volcanoes or other very hot and arid regions.

###### Spoils

A slain flame salamander can be harvested with Alchemy 2 for the following component useful in magic research:

* red ichor (18 2/6 st, 1,100gp, *bane-rune, burning sparks, blinding flash, conflagration, deflect ordinary weapons, energy protection* (fire), *inferno, phoenix aura, wall of flame,* armor +2)

###### Encounter

An 8’ diameter drift (horizontal mining tunnel) has been driven into the hillside here. The temperature within is quite warm, and the walls of the drift are blackened as if burned. About 40’ in, the drift widens to a 25’ x 40’ chamber, where 15 crates filled with miners’ tools (225gp, 10 st each) are stacked alongside one wall. Opposite is a large four-wheeled cart, crawling with tiny black beetles. The beetles are harmless, and conceal a pile of 48 ingots of unrefined gold ore (300gp, 2 st each). Past the chamber, the drift follows the meandering course of a mined-out vein, intersected every 100’ by crosscuts connected to vertical ventilation shafts and downward-sloping drainage adits, eventually terminating after 900’. Those following the vein, or gathering the gold from the cart, will attract the new denizens of the shaft: **six flame salamanders**.

**Flame salamanders (6):** Spd 120’, AC 7, HD 8\*, hp 40, #AT 3 (2 claws/bite 3+), Dmg 1d4 {F!}{S!} /1d4 {F!}{S!} / 1d8 {F!}{O!}, Save F8, ML 0, AL N, XP 1,100; Special: aura of heat, immunities

### Salamander, Frost

The frost salamander is a kind of intelligent water elemental. It resembles a giant six-legged lizard with ice-white scales. A typical specimen measures 16' to 20' in length and weighs around 2,600 lbs.

Frost salamanders speak their own tongue, which sounds like ice cracking. They virtually never speak any other languages. Frost salamanders and flame salamanders despise one another and will always fight if in the same vicinity.

###### Combat

An **aura of intense cold** surrounds a frost salamander in a 20’ radius. Any creature that begins its initiative in, or moves into, the aura suffers 1d8 {C!} damage and must make a Blast saving throw. If the save fails, the creature becomes **hypothermic**. If already hypothermic, it loses 1 CON.

The claws a frost salamander deal 1d6 {C!} {S!} damage, while its bite deals 2d6 {C!} {P!} damage.

Flame salamanders are **immune** to enchantment effects, to fire damage and to mundane bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. They can held at bay by *holy circle.* If summoned, they can bedispelled with *counterspell* or *dispel magic*.

###### Ecology

These creatures prefer to live in icy and cold regions. Frost salamanders and flame salamanders despise one another and will always fight if in the same vicinity.

###### Spoils

A slain frost salamander can be harvested with Alchemy 2 for the following components useful in magic research:

* white ichor (35 st, 2,100gp, *bane-rune, cone of frost, deflect ordinary weapons, energy protection (cold)*, *frostbite, ice floe, ice sheet, ice storm, wall of frost,* armor +2)

###### Encounter

A 24’ high waterfall spilling over a 65’ wide crest of limestone and sandstone has frozen over, transforming the cascade into a curtain of ice adorned with giant icicles. Someone or something has gouged a 6’ diameter hole at the base of the icy curtain. The opening leads to a 15’ wide cave that runs the length of the falls, chiseled out by the incessant falling water prior to its freezing. Lairing in the cave are **three frost salamanders.** The bone-chilling cold which emanates from these creatures is responsible for the miracle of the frozen falls.

**Frost Salamanders (3):** MV 120’, AC 6, HD 12\*, hp 65 each #AT 5 (4 claws/bite 1+), Dmg 1d6 {C!} {S!} per claw) / 2d6 {C!} {P!}, Save F12, ML 0, AL C, XP 2,100; Special: aura of cold

In the back of the cave there is a large wall of ice with five preserved bodies. If the salamanders are slain, the wall will slowly melt; this will take 1d6 hours, but can be reduced to as little as one turn with appropriate fire sources. All of the dead wear cloaks and armor stitched with the insignia of a silver hammer*.* They are *The Hammers of Türas,* an adventuring band that disappeared about ten years ago

One dead adventurer carries a sack holding 2,000ep, 5,000gp, two aquamarines (500gp), a ruby (1,000gp), a diamond (2,000gp), and an imperial topaz (4,000gp). A second carries a bag with a jade tiara (800gp), a pair of alabaster bracelets (1,100gp), a pink philter that smells strongly of roses (*philter of love*), an amber-colored honey-scented fluid (*potion of healing*), and a *cursed scroll (*destroys a random magic item), written in Zaharan. The remaining bodies have no valuables.

### Scorpion, Giant

These aggressive giant cousins to scorpions are about 6' long and weigh about 230 lbs. According to Empyrean and Zaharan myth, giant scorpions were born of the Predestined War. When Ianna, Empyrean goddess of war, cut the belly of Galmorm, Chthonic god of poison, his demonic ichor fell upon ordinary scorpions and transformed them into monstrous giants. Whether the myth is true or not, the cultists of Galmorm revere the deadly arachnids, and some temples even go so far as to rear and breed them.

###### Combat

Giant scorpions have **acute olfaction** and gain a +1 bonus to avoid surprise in their native habitat. Their exoskeletons are covered with tiny bristles that grant the scorpions **aerial mechanoreception** to a range of 60’.

In combat, giant scorpions attacks with their pincers and stinger. If a scorpion successfully hits a creature with both of its pincers, it automatically hits with its **venomous stinger**. Any creature damaged by the scorpion’s stinger must make a Death saving throw or die at the end of the scorpion’s initiative.

###### Ecology

When a nest of giant scorpions is encountered, there is a 5% chance each scorpion is carrying 2d12 baby scorplings in its brood sac. These baby scorplings will be near birth and can be captured if the scorpion is killed.

###### Spoils

A slain giant scorpion can be harvested with Animal Husbandry 2 for the following components useful in magic research:

* carapace (3/6 st, 35gp, armor +2)
* stinger (1 4/6 st, 100gp, *poison, swift strike*)

If not used for magic research, a scorpion's stinger fetches 4gp and weighs 4/6 st. Its venom (onset time 1 turn, +2 saving modifier, 2d10 {Po} damage on failed Death saving throw) fetches 400gp and weighs 1/6 st.

Like all arachnids, giant scorpions are cunning enough to learn but so hostile as to be almost untrainable.

###### Encounter

An ancient stream once pierced the cliff face here, leaving an arched-shaped opening, some 40’ wide and 30’ high, into a cavern beyond. The stream itself has gone dry, leaving just a dusty wadi that leads into the darkness like a sunken trail. During the day, the cavern is home to a nest of **six giant scorpions**.At night, the scorpions hunt in the vicinity.

**Giant scorpions (6):** Spd 150’, AC 7, HD 4\*, hp 20 each, #AT 3 (2 claws/sting 7+), Dmg 1d10 {P} /1d10 {P} /1d4 {P} + poison, Save F2, ML +3, AL C, XP 135; Special: venomous stinger

Nailed to the rear wall of the cave is a wrought silver holy symbol of Galmorm, Chthonic god of thievery, treachery, and poison. The symbol is shaped in the form of a striking scorpion and adorned with opals (2,000gp value).

### Seal, Common

Common seals are aquatic mammals around 8’ in length and 750 lbs in weight. They are found throughout the coastal waters of the Ammas Aurë. They rarely stray into deep water, preferring to stay by beaches where they can congregate, give birth, and take refuge from predators. However, they are shy creatures and if the shorelines become built up, they will abandon the beaches in favor of undersea caves remote from human and demi-human activity.

###### Combat

Seals have exceptionally sensitive whiskers that can detect vibrations in the water. These whiskers grant them **aquatic mechanoreception** to 240’. Spells or effects that would ordinarily cause blindness do not affect the seal while it is using aquatic mechanoreception. However, creatures that are not in the water are invisible to them. Aquatic mechanoreception does not penetrate structures or terrain features.

Seals are agile and intelligent. They know how to **take refu**ge from aquatic predators by beaching onto the shore and from terrestrial predators by diving into the water. If a seal is attacked in water within 150’ of shore, of attacked on land within 30’ of water, it can withdraw or retreat to the other environment.

When hunting, or forced to fight, seals attack with their bite for 2d4 {P} damage. If a seal damages a tiny or small target with its bite, it can **violently shake and toss** the target, inflicting an additional 2d4 {Se} damage.

###### Ecology

When a congregation of seals is encountered, the adults will be accompanied by 1d8 juvenile seals and 1d6 baby seals. Juvenile seals have Spd 20’ / 120’ swim, AC 1, HD 1, and attack with a bite (1d3 {P}). Baby seals have Spd 20’ / 120’ swim, AC 0, HD 1-1, and attack with a nibble (1 {P}).

###### Spoils

A slain seal with extraordinary characteristics can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following component useful in magic research:

* blubber (2/6 st., 20gp, *protection from temperature, swimming*)

Unlike most animals, the pelts of babies and juveniles are as or more valuable as the pelts of adults. A baby seal’s pelt fetches 16.5gp and weighs 1/6 st. A juvenile seal’s pelt fetches 25gp and weighs 2/6 st. An adult seal’s pelt fetches 110gp and weighs 2 st.

### Sea Serpent

Sages are divided as to whether sea serpents are the degenerate descendants of sea dragons or prehistoric remnants of some ancient serpentine creature that has gone extinct on land. Sailors are unanimous in believing that sea serpents are exceptionally dangerous predators with a propensity to sink ships. The immense snake-like monsters measure 30' long and weigh around 6,500 lbs.

###### Combat

A sea serpent will be automatically Hostile to any vessel it encounters with a length of less than 30’. It might or might not be Hostile to larger vessels (make a reaction roll).

Sea serpents have on a lateral line system that affords them **aquatic mechanoreception**. They can “see” in water up to 360’ by sensing changes in water current and water pressure. Spells or effects that would ordinarily cause blindness do not affect the serpent while it is using aquatic mechanoreception. However, creatures that are not in the water are invisible to them. Aquatic mechanoreception does not penetrate structures or terrain features.

A sea serpent can bite creatures within 15’ of the water with its vicious fangs for 2d6 {P!} damage. It can also constrict its serpentine coils around vessels or creatures of huge size or larger in the water. A successful constriction deals 1d10 {B!} damage and, as a gigantic creature, it deals full structural damage to vessels. It also **restrains** the creature or vessel in the serpent’s coils (p. XX). Thereafter, while the creature or vessel remains restrained, the sea serpent can automatically deal an additional 1d10 {B!} damage on its initiative each round to the restrained creature or vessel without having to make an attack throw. Doing so counts as the serpent’s constriction attack.

A sea serpent cannot bite vessels, nor can it constrict creatures of large size or less, or creatures of any size in the air, on land or in vessels.

###### Ecology

Sea serpents do not establish nests or exhibit any parental care for their offspring. They rely on pelagic spawning, in which the female releases her eggs into the water column and the male externally fertilizes them. The eggs are buoyant and simply float until they hatch. Sea serpent eggs have 1 hp and weigh 1 3/6 st.

###### Spoils

Although sea serpents have no lairs, their propensity for eating the cargo of sunken ships means they may have treasure inside their bellies.

A slain sea serpent can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the following components useful in magic research:

* stomach (9 3/6 st, 570gp, *capsizing wave, choking grip, locate treasure, swimming, waterbreathing*)

### Sepulchral Worm

When a dead body is mummified, it is customary to remove the intestines, along with other organs, for preservation in canopic jars. If, instead, the intestines are left inside the corpse, and the corpse is then necromantically transformed into an undead mummy, then the intestines will transform too, becoming sepulchral worms: Writhing, biting, snake-like maggots that erupt from the mummy’s abdomen. Sepulchral worms are considered a blessing by the mad priests of Dirgion, who honor their martyrs and bishops by cultivating infestations in their undead bodies.

###### Combat

A mummy can be infested by up to 15 sepulchral worms. Sepulchral worms make any mummy they infest more fearsome. Characters encountering an infested mummy suffer a -1 penalty per 3 worms (rounded down) to their Paralysis saving throw against its horror. For instance, if a mummy has 11 sepulchral worms erupting from its abdomen, characters encountering the mummy suffer a -3 save penalty.

On an infested mummy’s initiative, each of the sepulchral worms in its body can spurt out like tentacles from its abdomen to bite living creatures within 15’. Each successful bite deals 1d4 {N!} {P!} damage. Any creature damaged by a bite begins **rotting**, just as if struck by a mummy.

Sepulchral worms are **immune** to enchantment effects, to necrotic and poisonous damage, and to mundane acidic, bludgeoning, cold, electric, piercing, seismic, and slashing damage. They are **resistant** to mundane fire damage and to extraordinary acidic, bludgeoning, cold, electric, piercing, seismic, and slashing damage. However, even a splash from holy water kills sepulchral worms instantly. They are rebuked as skeletons, separately from the mummy they infest.

Should sepulchral worms be rebuked while the mummy they infest is not, the worms **cower** and writhe in their mummy’s belly. Should the mummy they infest be destroyed, the sepulchral worms in its belly survive for one turn as independent undead. During this time they can move with a combat speed of 30’ per round.

###### Ecology

Sepulchral worms have no independent existence. They are only found in the undead mummies they infest.

###### Spoils

A destroyed sepulchral worm can be harvested with Healing 2 for the following components useful in magic research:

* desiccated worm (2/6 st., 16gp, *cause disease, inspire horror, summon insect plague*)

###### Lore

*Blessed are the green worms of putrefaction which crawl upon the sacred scions. Blessed are the brave souls whose indomitable will animates the rotting cadavers. Let the worm spread and the blessed gift of undeath spread.*

* Ishme-Dagon, *The Corporium,* Vol. 4 “On the Animation of Sepulchral Worms”

### Shadow

At first glimpse, shadows appear as just the ordinary silhouettes cast by a human body occluding a light source. A closer look reveals that there is no body to cast a shadow – and that the silhouette moves with its own malevolent purpose.

Often mistaken for undead, shadows are actually incorporeal entities from the Outer Darkness. Some sages believe they are bodiless cacodemons; others argue they are dead spirits that have been damned to the black void and returned. All agree that shadows hunger for the life-energy of living creatures.

###### Combat

Shadows **move with utter silence** and cannot be detected by echolocation or listening. They are **difficult to spot** except in bright daylight, and characters encountering them suffer a -3 penalty to surprise rolls.

When a shadow successfully attacks a living creature, its **enervating touch** deals 1d4 {N!} damage to the creature, then permanently reduces the target’s maximum hp by an amount equal to the damage dealt. If the creature’s hp are reduced to 0, the creature is slain.

If not slain, the creature becomes **enervated**.An enervated creature must make a Death saving throw each day when it wakes from resting. If the save fails, the creature permanently reduces its maximum hp by another point. If the save succeeds, the creature does not reduce its maximum hp further that day. If a creature’s hp are reduced to 0 by the enervating touch, the creature is slain. If the save succeeds three times in a row, the condition ends. Otherwise, a creature can only end the condition and restore its maximum hp via ritual magic.

If a creature is slain by the enervating touch or enervated condition, it cannot be restored to life save by ritual magic*.* Its soul lingers by its corpse for a day before being exiled to the Outer Darkness, where it might eventually turn into a shadow itself– a horrible and irrevocable fate!

Shadows are **immune** to enchantment effects, poisonous damage, and all mundane damage. As **incorporeal** beings, natural and non-magical weapons always deal mundane damage against them, even if the creature would otherwise deal extraordinary damage. However, silver weapons deal extraordinary damage against them. They can be detected with *discern evil*, held at bay by *holy circle*, destroyed with *dispel evil* and, if summoned, *dispelled.* In addition, they cannot enter an area lit by direct daylight or magical *illumination*.

###### Ecology

Shadows are unholy creatures with no natural habitat. They enter our world when summoned or by passing through sinkholes of evil found in temples of chaos and places of death.

###### Spoils

Destroyed shadows can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the following component useful in magic research:

* shadowy residue (1 st, 71gp, *disfigure body and soul, life drain, tenebrosity*)

### Shark, Bull

Bull sharks are brown and grey sharks with broad, flat snouts that give them a blunt appearance. They typically reach a length of 8’ and weight of 290 lbs. They are found in warm, shallow waters along coasts and in rivers.

###### Combat

Bull sharks have a lateral line system that affords them **aquatic mechanoreception**. They can “see” in water up to 180’ by sensing changes in water current and water pressure. They also have **acute olfaction** granting them a +1 bonus to avoid surprise in their native habitat. They can sense blood in the water to a range of 300’.

Once they sense blood, bull sharks become **furious feeders** and will fight to the death without making morale rolls.

###### Ecology

Though bull sharks are not social creatures, they are often found in large groups in feeding grounds. Bull sharks give birth to live young, but the pups are immediately independent and receive no parental care.

###### Spoils

A slain bull shark with exceptional attributes can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following component useful in magic research:

* dorsal fin (3/6 st, 29gp, *righteous wrath, swimming,* weapon +1)

###### Lore

*Though to our Auran eyes they seem an unruly rabble, the pirates of the Syrnasos are not entirely lawless. When a pirate is alleged to have committed a crime, such as showing cowardice before the enemy, then his captain (for so the chiefs of the Syrnasos style themselves) drags him before the assembled crew and reads aloud the charges. The defendant is then given leave to rebut the charges as best he is able. Afterwards, any crew member can speak for or against the defendant. When all the speakers have finished, the crew by acclamation decides whether the defendant should be convicted. If, in the captain’s ears, the acclamation is uncertain, he entrusts the decision to Calefa, goddess of Fortune, by casting a bone marked with faces showing guilt or innocence.*

*If the defendant is convicted, the punishment inflicted on him is governed by custom and tradition. For cowardice, a convict suffers whipping; for spreading scurrilous rumors, the taking of his teeth; for falling asleep on watch, the taking of an eye. For higher crimes, a guilty culprit is executed.*

*The Syrnasans have a most ingenious method of execution which is well-suited to their maritime culture. First, they slice long cuts into the arms and legs of the convict, so that blood courses from him freely. Then he is made to walk down a boarding ramp until he stands over open sea. The ramp is then shaken, such that the hapless convict falls into the water. There, the churning of his bloody limbs soon attracts shivers of sharks, who make short work of the knave.*

### Shark, Great White

These immense sharks are silvery-grey with white bellies. They can reach lengths exceeding 20' and can weigh over 4,000 lbs. Vicious and predatory, great white sharks will attack virtually anything, including small boats.

###### Combat

Great white sharks have a lateral line system that affords them **aquatic mechanoreception**. They can “see” in water up to 180’ by sensing changes in water current and water pressure. They also have **acute olfaction** granting them a +1 bonus to avoid surprise in their native habitat. They can sense blood in the water to a range of 300’. They also

Once they sense blood, they become **furious feeders** and will fight to the death without making morale rolls.

Due to their massive jaws, great white sharks can deliver **vicious bites**. A creature bitten with an attack throw of unmodified 20 must make a Death saving throw. If the save succeeds, the bite inflicts double damage dice (4d10 {P!}). If the save fails, the bite inflicts triple damage dice (6d10 {P!}) and the creature loses a limb. Roll 1d6 to determine which limb is lost: 1-2 weapon hand, 3 weapon arm, 4-5 near leg, 6 far leg. A character who loses a limb cannot be healed above 1 hp until he receives 2 weeks of bed rest.

###### Ecology

Great white sharks are solitary apex predators. However, they are often found in groups in abundant feeding grounds. Like other sharks, great whites give birth to live young. The pups are immediately independent and receive no parental care.

###### Spoils

A slain great white shark with exceptional attributes can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following components useful in magic research:

* tail (8 2/6 st, 500gp, *righteous wrath, swimming*)
* skull (10 st, 600gp, *sharpness,* weapon +3)

A great white shark's armored hide fetches 175gp and weighs 11 st. A great white shark’s fangs fetch 20gp and weigh 2/6 st.

###### Lore

*When Tychado, the king of Tritons, won victory over the Selacharim host, he claimed for himself their princess Dimeritia and made of her his wife; for Tychado unwisely thought that their child could unify their warring peoples. But the blood of Lammala ran in the veins of the royal line of the Selacharim, and it fouled the womb. The child that Dimeritia birthed was neither Triton nor Selacharim, but rather a monster of fin and fang, an eater of men that lusted for blood. Horrified by what Dimeritia had birthed, Tychado struck her down, then seized the child, and hurled it into the black waters of the Tehonaurë. But as she lay dying Dimeritia blessed her child, prophesying it would sire many children that who would bring fear to the Tritons for as long as they dwelled in the depths.*

### Shark, Mako

Mako sharks are aggressive predators that will unhesitatingly attack large prey. A typical specimen has a grey or tan hide with a length of 12’ to 15’ weight of 1,050 lbs.

###### Combat

Mako sharks have a lateral line system that affords them **aquatic mechanoreception**. They can “see” in water up to 180’ by sensing changes in water current and water pressure.

They also have **acute olfaction** granting them a +1 bonus to avoid surprise in their native habitat. They can sense blood in the water to a range of 300’.

Once they sense blood, they become **furious feeders** and will fight to the death without making morale rolls.

Mako sharks are among the fastest swimmers in the oceans. They are also **prodigious leapers**; a mako shark that charges on its initiative can jump up to 20’ vertically and horizontally out of the water at any point in its movement.

###### Ecology

Mako sharks are solitary predators. However, they are often found in groups in abundant feeding grounds. Like other sharks, mako sharks give birth to live young. The pups are immediately independent and receive no parental care.

###### Spoils

A slain mako shark with exceptional attributes can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following component useful in magic research:

* dorsal fin (2 1/6 st, 135gp, *righteous wrath, swimming*, weapon +1)

Mako sharks can be trained only with great difficulty. Only the most foolish animal trainers even try!

###### Lore

*The Aquarium of Metapon-Nemo, in Istakahr, must surely be considered one of the great wonders of the world. A vast structure which rivals the size of Aura’s Grand Colosseum, it has been used for centuries by the pharaohs of Kemesh to glorify their grim gods.*

*Bel is honored with sea battles staged between galleys crewed by gladiators, who must win or drown. Nargund and Lammala are commemorated with pitched battles between betwitched sea monsters… while Dirgion, the Doombringer, he is honored by deadly races.*

*The contestants – captives, debtors, slaves, and occasionally volunteers – are each marked with a small cut, then made to enter the water at one end of the Aquarium. Their objective is to be the fastest to swim to the far end. When the contestants are halfway, however, the underwater gates below the Aquarium are opened to release hungry mako sharks. It is said that no sea creature – not the dolphin, not the manta ray, not even the mighty whale – can swim as fast as these fell predators…*

* Basilio, *Wonders of the World*

### Siren

Often mistaken for tritones (mermaids), the siren is actually an aquatic relative of the harpy. The first sirens are reputed to have been born when Nasga, Chthonic goddess of beauty and pain, seduced Naurivus, Empyrean god of water and weather, into giving her daughters. The creatures have the faces, breasts, and abdomens of beautiful women, but the tails of sea-fish. They are the same size and stature as tritones about 6’ tall and weigh 200 lbs.

Sirens typically speak Ancient Zaharan, Common, Triton, and the local dialects of fishermen and sailors.

###### Combat

As a full-round action, a siren can sing an **enthralling song**.Once begun, the song continues until the start of the siren’s next initiative or until it is slain. While a siren is singing, each creature within earshot of it (240’ in normal environments), except another siren, must make a Spells saving throw at the start of its initiative. If more than one siren is singing, the creature saves once with a -2 penalty for each additional siren in earshot.

If the saving throw succeeds, the creature gains immunity to the effects of every siren’s enthralling songs until the start of its next initiative. If the saving throw fails, the creature becomes **enthralled**. On its initiative, an enthralled creature will move at combat speed towards the nearest siren that enthralled it. If on a vessel, the creature will dive off the vessel and into the water, risking Swimming throws as necessary. If actually steering a vessel, the enthralled creature will steer it towards the sirens, automatically hitting whatever nautical hazard the sirens live upon!

Once within 5’ of the siren, the creature will remain stationary (if it has a swimming speed) or start drowning (if not). In any case, the creature cannot take full-round actions, combat actions, or even speak, and is **vulnerable** to the sirens’ attacks. A creature remains enthralled until the effect is dispelled, the siren is slain, or 6 turns elapse.

If forced to fight, sirens dive into the water and attack with their natural weapons preferring to target drowning creatures where possible. Sirens instinctually know how to take advantage of vulnerable targets (as Ambushing proficiency).

###### Ecology

Sirens always make their homes on nautical hazards such as dangerous rocks or jagged reefs, favoring those near coasts that enjoy frequent maritime traffic. Roll 1d6 to determine the type of hazard upon which the sirens have laired: 1-2, rocks; 3, reef; 4, wreck; 5, sandbar; 6 shoal. Since sirens never swim far from their lairs, the lair roll actually determines whether the siren dwells alone or dwells in a school with other sirens.

Sirens reproduce through deception. Pretending to be a mermaid, a siren will seduce an eligible triton into impregnating her and remain with him as his apparent wife until her egg hatches. Thereafter the siren will disappear, leaving her child to be raised by the tritons. Male hatchlings develop into ordinary tritons, but female hatchlings develop into sirens, discovering their true nature in adolescence.

* vocal cords (2/6 st, 20gp, *angelic choir, bewitch humanoid, dominate humanoid, enslave humanoid*)
* tail fin (2/6 st, 19gp, *swimming*, *water breathing*)

### Skeletal Slayer

In life, skeletal slayers were great champions of the Chthonic gods and sorcerer-kings. In undeath, they continue to serve their evil masters as four-armed skeletal abominations with plate armor bolted onto their bones and gleaming swords in each of their four bony hands.

Skeleton slayers are intelligent and can speak, usually in an ancient or dead tongue such as Zaharan. They have no desire to collect treasure. Instead they seek to fulfill their ancient oaths of duty and to test their mettle in combat, in the best case against worthy opponents.

###### Combat

Skeletal slayers have a **horrific** **visage**. When a creature first beholds one or more skeletal slayer, and at the start of each round thereafter that the creature beholds one or more slayers, the creature must make a Paralysis saving throw. The save suffers a -1 penalty per additional skeletal slayer after the first. If the save fails, the creature is **cowering** until the start of the next round. If the save succeeds, the creature gains immunity to the effects of every slayer’s horrific visage for 1 turn.

In combat, skeletal slayers can attack once with each sword (4 attacks total) per combat action. A successful attack deals 1d8 {S!} damage. Some skeletal slayers are equipped with magic swords; if so, each sword’s bonus applies separately to the slayer’s attack and damage with that sword.

Skeleton slayers are **immune** to enchantment effects, necrotic damage, piercing damage, and poisonous damage. They are **resistant** to mundane damage. They are inherently evil for purposes of *discern evil*and *holy circle*spells and are rebuked as mummies.

###### Ecology

Being undead, skeletal slayers have no native habitat. They are usually found as guardian of the crypts and tombs of royalty, where they sleep away the centuries in *torpor* until roused by intruders – or the Awakening.

###### Spoils

A destroyed skeletal slayer can be harvested with Healing 2 for the following components useful in magic research:

* skull (1 4/6 st., 100gp, *inspire horror, shrieking skull*)
* upper arm bones(3 2/6 st., 200gp, *swift sword,* sword +1)
* lower arm bones (3/26 st., 200gp, *striking,* sword +1)

###### Lore

*Fear not if your body is diseased or ruined, for the strength of your soul can sustain it! Aye, even if you be reduced to naught but bone, the blessed power of Dirgion can maintain your spiritual existence forever.*

* Ishme-Dagan, *The Corporium,* Vol. 5, “The Higher Art of Necromancy”

### Skeleton

The bones of the dead can be animated by dark magic, magic replacing muscle and sinew to enable the skeleton to walk in a clattering parody of human mobility. Some of these animated skeletons are created by necromantic magic, while others spawn from remains in sinkholes of evil.

Most skeletons are created from human bones, but the bones of other creatures can be used, provided they are relatively intact. A skeleton created from non-human bones has a number of HD equal to what the creature possessed in life (excluding class levels).

Despite their clattering animus, skeletons have only the barest flicker of sapience. Because of their stupidity, any instructions given to a skeleton by its creator or controller must be very simple. In the absence of orders or opponents, skeletons simply tumble to the ground in bony heaps.

Some skeleton are clad in nothing more than the rotting remnants of the clothing they wore in life, but others are armored and armed by their evil masters. A skeleton wearing armor adds the AC bonus to its own natural AC of 2.

###### Combat

Unless under another’s control, skeletons are automatically Hostile to any living creature they encounter

Skeletons can attack with melee or missile weapons (if available) or with natural attacks. Skeletons that had natural attacks when living retain their natural attacks. Skeletons that had no natural attacks gain a bony claw attack dealing 1d6 {B} damage (plus an average of 2 {B} damage per HD after 1 HD). Skeletons with more than 4+1 HD deal extraordinary damage.

Skeletons are **immune** to enchantment effects, necrotic damage, and poisonous damage. They are inherently evil for purposes of *discern evil*and *holy circle*spells. Regardless of their HD, all skeletons can be rebuked easily (e.g. as skeletons) by casters capable of doing so.

###### Ecology

Skeletons that were birthed in sinkholes of evil will usually be found lingering in the vicinity of the sinkhole, unless the pursuit of living creatures draws them away. Skeletons that were created by chaotic spellcasters are frequently found guarding locations or valuable treasure in dungeons.

###### Spoils

A destroyed skeleton can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the following component useful in magic research:

* skull (1/6 st, 13gp, *shrieking skull, undead legion*)

### Skittering Maw

A hideous creation of the malignant mage Vermeren, the skittering maw has the body of a giant centipede and the head of a great white shark. Growing to over 30' in length and 4,000 lbs in weight, the skittering maw prefers dark, wet locations and stagnant waters.

###### Combat

Like the great white sharks from which they were bred, skittering maws have **acute olfaction** that grants them a +1 bonus to avoid surprise in their native habitat.

Due to their great size, skittering maws are even more **poisonous** than their centipede progenitors. Any creature damaged by a skittering maw’s bite must make a successful Death saving throw or die in 1 turn.

###### Ecology

When a nest of skittering maws is encountered, there is a 15% chance per maw that it will be incubating a clutch of 1d6 eggs. The eggs have 1 hp and weigh 1/6 st. Skittering maw hatchlings are rarely found in nests, because the larvae immediately disperse into the wild after they emerge from their eggs.

###### Spoils

A slain skittering maw can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the following components useful in magic research:

* dorsal fine (8 2/6 st, 500gp, *swimming,* armor +1)
* fangs (10 st, 600gp, *poison,* weapon +2)
* gills (8 2/6 st, 500gp, desiccate, water breathing)

If not used for magic research, a skittering maw’s fangs fetch 20gp and weigh 2/6 st. Its venom (onset time 1 round, +1 saving modifier, 8d6 {Po} damage on failed Death saving throw) fetches 700gp and weighs 1/6 st.

###### Encounter

An archway, some 105’ wide and 20’ high, was long ago carved into a rocky slope by a fast-running stream. The archway opens into a stream-cut tunnel that runs 120’ inward, terminating in an underground lake within a cavern 215’ long, 150’ wide, with 20’ high ceilings. The lake, 25’ deep at its center, is the lair of a mated **pair of skittering maws**.

Any characters who traverse the lake will discover that the far wall of the cavern has been hand-carved with elven runes. Below the runes, the cavern floor is inscribed with a summoning circle, within which sits a patinated copper *basin of conjuring water elementals*. A water-logged oak box, about 12” x 6” x 6” sits adjacent to the circle. It is actually a *collapsible boat.* Its command word, “*uisce,*” is the elven word for water.

**Skittering maws (2):** Spd 60’/180’ swim, AC 5, HD 8\*\*, hp 43, 32, #AT 1 (bite 3+), Dmg 2d10 {P!} + poison, Save F4, ML+4, AL N, Special: poison bite

### Slime, Sage

This animate, viscous slime has a pale, greyish-green color that resembles the leaves of the sage plant. A typical specimen will be approximately 10’ in diameter and 1,200 lbs in weight. Sage slime can inch forward along floors, walls, and ceilings, undulate through water, and can ooze through tiny fissures or gaps in doorways.

###### Combat

Sage slime habitually lurk on ceilings, ledges, and other high places. The slime is **natural stealthy** when so positioned, and creatures encountering the slime suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls. It possesses **terrestrial mechanoreception** enabling it to sense vibration in the ground over long distances equivalent to line of sight in full daylight. When it detects a creature beneath itself, sage slime will attack by dropping down onto the target. If it misses, the slime drops adjacent to the target, from where it can attack on the following round.

When attacking, sage slime can ignore the target’s AC from armor, but not AC from DEX, magic items, natural armor, or spells. (Any creatures foolish or unlucky enough to move into the slime’s area are automatically hit.) If a slime’s attack hits, it **engulfs** the creature.

An engulfed creature can still move, but count as carrying an extra 120 stone of encumbrance. The slime moves with the creature it is latched onto. A sage slime will continue engulfing a creature until the creature dies or the slime is destroyed. The slime clings in such a way to make scraping it off ineffective.

Once a sage slime has engulfed a creature, it can use its combat action to consume 1 stone of armor or clothing worn by the creature. Once it has consumed all of the creature’s armor and clothing, it can use its combat action to automatically deal 1d8 {A!} damage to the creature. Any creature reduced to 0 hp or fewer by a sage slime is immediately slain and its body consumed. As the slime consumes the creature, it metabolizes it into more slime. The slime gains 1 hp for every point of damage it deals; when its hp double, it splits itself into two new slimes.

Sage slime is **immune** to enchantment effects and to acidic, arcane, bludgeoning, cold, electric, luminous, necrotic, piercing, poisonous, seismic, and slashing damage. It can be harmed with fire, but the damage is divided evenly between the slime and any creature(s) it has engulfed. Sage slime is killed instantly by a *cure disease* spell.

###### Ecology

Sage slime is found in dank caves and dungeons where it serves as a decomposer that eliminates organic material. It feeds on plants, animals, and metals, including weapons and armor, but does not digest stone. It reproduces by budding, detaching a new sage smear (baby) each time it consumes 1,200 lbs of organic matter. It can also reproduce by metabolizing living creatures into sage slime (described above).

###### Spoils

A destroyed sage slime can be harvested with Alchemy for the following component useful in magic research:

### Slug, Giant

Giant slugs are enormous gastropods. A typical giant slug measures 20’ long and weighs 7,200 lbs, but some grow to twice that length and eight times the mass. They are pale gray in color with a dull white underbelly, and possess a single pair of long, thin tentacles which can detect light, heat, and scent. Their ribbon-like mouths reveal rows of small, sharp teeth. They are found in moist or wet environments such as swamps, marshes, rain forests, and dungeons.

A giant slug moves by contracting and expanding its muscular “foot” over a large slime trail that reduces friction. It can squeeze its squishy, flexible body into corridors as narrow as 5’ wide, though this may prevent it turning around. They are both scavengers and predators, feeding on both plants and animals.

###### Combat

Giant slugs have **acute olfaction** and gain a +1 bonus to avoid surprise in their native habitat. In combat, they can bite for 1d12 {P!} damage or **spit acid** to a range of 60’ for 5d8 {A!{ damage.

A slug leaves a **trail of wet** **slime** on the ground behind it wherever it moves. The trail dries after 1 round. While wet it is highly slippery (as a *slickness* spell). The dried trail can be tracked automatically by characters with Tracking proficiency, and on 4+ by those without.

Due to their squishy bodies, giant slugs are **immune** to mundane bludgeoning damage. They are **susceptible** to seismic damage, which tends to splatter them into thousands of slimy gibbets. They save against seismic damage at a -2 penalty and suffer double damage dice.

Salt has a deadly desiccating effect on slugs. A 1lb bag of salt (thrown like a vial of oil) deals 1d8 {N} damage to a slug for 2 rounds on a direct hit or 1d3 {N} damage on a splash.

Giant slug are **attracted by beer**. When at least 5 st. of beer is within 240’, a giant slug will move towards the beer and begin to consume it. If attacked, it will retaliate, but otherwise will take no action until the beer is consumed (which takes 1 turn). Conversely, they are **repelled by copper**. 1,500cp will suffice to form a 5’ x 6” wide barrier that a slug will not cross.

###### Ecology

Giant slugs are hermaphroditic egg-layers that do not establish nests or exhibit any parental care for their offspring. After mating, the slug simply deposits its eggs in a moist, hidden place such as a tree hollow or leaf pile. Giant slug eggs have 1 hp and weight 1/6 st.

###### Spoils

A slain giant slug can be harvested with Animal Husbandry 2 for the following components useful in magic research:

* acid glands (10 st, 600gp, *rain of vitriol, vitriolic infusion*)

### Snake, Giant Constricting Viper

The giant constricting viper is a primeval serpent that can grow to be up to 50’ long, with a head the size of a horse’s skull and a girth as tall as a man. They are native only to the wild jungles of Ulruk. However, their size and power makes them attractive to cultists, sorcerers, and other dark personalities, so tamed or charmed specimens can sometimes be found in dungeons, temples, and tombs.

###### Combat

Giant constricting vipers have **acute olfaction** that grants them a +1 bonus to avoid surprise in their natural habitat. Unlike most animals, they can “see” the heat of living creatures, granting them **lightless vision** to a range of 60’.

A giant constricting viper attacks with a **venomous** bite that deals 3d6 {P!} damage. Any creature damaged by its bite must make a Death saving throw. If the save fails, the creature is immediately **maddened** by pain. If the venom is not neutralized, the creature will die 1d4+2 turns later.

When the viper successfully bites a creature, it automatically constricts the creature for 5d6 {B!} damage and **restrains** it. If the viper misses its bite, it can separately attack by constriction. Once a creature has been restrained, the viper can automatically deal 5d6 {B!} damage on its initiative each round to the restrained creature without having to make an attack throw. Doing so counts as the python’s constriction attack.

###### Ecology

While giant constricting vipers sometimes congregate in dens during brumation or breeding season, they do not exhibit any parental care for their offspring. Their young are born fully formed with functional venom glands. The precocious snakelets quickly disperse after birth.

###### Spoils

A slain giant constricting viper can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following components useful in magic research:

* fangs (11 4/6 st., 700gp, *neutralize poison, poison*)
* spine (11 4/6 st., 700gp, *choking grip, iron maiden*)
* tongue (11 4/6 st., 700gp, *staffs to snakes, snakes to staffs*)

If not used for magic research, a giant constricting viper’s fangs fetch 18gp and weigh 2/6 st. Its venom (onset time instant / 1d4+2 turns, no saving modifier, **madness**/death on failed Death saving throw) fetches 1,000gp and weighs 1/6 st.

Giant constricting vipers have a wicked cunning that makes them capable of being trained as guards, but they are foul-tempered and hard to handle.

### Snake, King Cobra

King cobras are 10’ to 15' long carnivorous serpents that are native to southern Somirea. As apex predators, king cobras prey primarily on other snakes and lizards. They have been known to slay and swallow giant lizards, though usually their prey is smaller.

Like the viper, the cobra is revered as a symbol of the Chthonic gods in the Sunset Kingdoms and despised for the same reason in the east.

###### Combat

King cobras have **acute olfaction** that grants them a +1 bonus to avoid surprise in their natural habitat. They can also sense earth-borne vibrations, granting them a limited **terrestrial mechanoreception** with a maximum range of 300’.

They are extremely quick, and can bite twice with each combat action for 1d4 {P} damage. Any creature damaged by a bite must make a Death saving throw. If the save fails, the creature dies of poison 1d4+2 turns later.

Any creature unlucky enough to be damaged by both bites must make two saving throws. If either saving throw fails, the creature dies of poison 1d4+2 turns later. If both saving throws fail, the creature dies of poison 1 turn later.

###### Ecology

King cobras are the only snake that constructs actual nests to guard their young. When a nest of cobras is encountered, there is a 10% chance per cobra that it will be incubating a clutch of 2d20 eggs. The eggs have 1 hp and weight 1/1000 st (1 coin). Cobra snakelets are rarely found in nests, because the snakelets immediately disperse into the wild after they emerge from their eggs.

###### Spoils

A slain king cobra with exceptional attributes can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following components useful in magic research:

* fangs (4/6 st., 45gp, *poison*)
* hood (4/6 st., 45gp,  *frighten humanoid*)
* tongue (4/6 st., 45gp, *snakes to staffs, staffs to snakes*)

If not used for magic research, a king cobra’s fangs fetch 4gp and weigh 1/6 st. Its venom (onset time 1d10 turns, +2 saving modifier, 4d6 {Po} damage on failed Death saving throw) fetches 250gp and weighs 1/6 st.

King cobras are the most intelligent of all snakes. Not only are they the only snake that constructs nests, they also can exhibit adaptable hunting strategies, navigate complex environments, and recognize individuals. Because of the king cobra’s trainability, many cultists of Iskara and Nasga breed and keep them in their temples.

### Snake, Python

Pythons are among the largest species of snakes. Measuring up to 20’ long and weighing up to 180 lbs, they are non-venomous predators that hunt by constriction. They are native to the jungles and swamps of Ulruk, and sometimes bred by the great chiefs of that continent as totems of power. Foolish traders and collectors have more than once allowed the creatures to escape into the wilds of Aurëpos, where they pose a threat to the natural order.

###### Combat

Pythons have **acute olfaction** that grants them a +1 bonus to avoid surprise in their natural habitat. Unlike most animals, they can “see” the heat of living creatures, granting them **lightless vision** to a range of 60’.

A python attacks with its bite, which deals 1d4 {P} damage. When the python successfully bites a creature, it automatically constricts the creature for 2d8 {B} damage and **restrains** it. If the python misses its bite, it can separately attack by constriction. Once it has restrained a creature, the python can automatically deal 2d8 {B} damage on its initiative each round to the restrained creature without having to make an attack throw. Doing so counts as the python’s constriction attack.

###### Ecology

Pythons are solitary creatures, but during breeding season it is not uncommon to find several pythons congregated in close proximity. When a den of pythons is encountered, there is a 10% chance per python that it will be incubating a clutch of 2d6+1 eggs. The eggs have 1 hp and weight 1/20 st. Python snakelets are rarely found in nests, because the snakelets immediately disperse into the wild after they emerge from their eggs.

###### Spoils

A slain python with exceptional attributes can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following components useful in magic research:

* spine (5 st., 300gp, *choking grip, iron maiden*)
* tongue (5/6 st., 50gp, *staffs to snakes, snakes to staffs*)

Pythons can be trained with significant difficulty, though they are somewhat easier to handle than the venomous snakes.

###### Encounter

A **python** of unusually large size dwells in the branches of a great fir tree, its scales an exquisite pattern of black and green.

**Python:** Str 18, Con 18; MV 90’, AC 3, HD 5\*, hp 40, #AT 2 (bite/constrict 3+), Dmg 1d4+3 {P} /2d8+6 {B}, Save F3, ML -1, XP 350; Special: restrain

### Snake, Sea Snake

These 6' long aquatic snakes are as aggressive as they are venomous. They have flattened tails utilized for swimming and beak-like snouts with which they catch fish. They can dive to a depth of more than 50 fathoms and remain underwater for up to 5 hours.

They are native to the waters of the Narrow Sea Ammas Aurë, and more than a few unlucky adventurers, fishermen, and pearl-divers have been slain by a mere prick from their fangs.

###### Combat

Sea snakes are **extremely aggressive** and any characters encountering them suffer a -2 penalty on reaction rolls.

Like other snakes, they possess **acute olfaction** that grants them a +1 bonus to avoid surprise in their natural habitat. They lack the heat-sensing organs of their land-bound cousins but possess **aquatic mechanoreception** that enables them to “see” in the water to a range of 60’. Spells or effects that would ordinarily cause blindness do not affect a sea snake using mechanoreception. However, creatures that are not in the water are invisible to the mechanoreception. Aquatic mechanoreception does not penetrate structures or terrain features.

Their bites do just 1 {P} damage, but any creature damaged by its bite must make a Death saving throw. If the save fails, the creature dies of poison 1d4+2 turns later.

###### Ecology

Sea snakes do not establish nests or exhibit any parental care for their offspring. Their young are born fully formed in the water, and are immediately capable of swimming and hunting on their own.

###### Spoils

A slain sea snake with exceptional attributes can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following components useful in magic research:

* fangs (3/6 st., 35gp, *poison*)
* tongue (3/6 st., 30gp, *snakes to staffs, staffs to snakes*)

If not used for magic research, a sea snake’s fangs fetch 1gp and weigh 1/6 st. Its venom (onset time 1d10 turns, +2 saving modifier, 4d4 {Po} damage on failed Death saving throw) fetches 200gp if properly extracted.

###### Lore

*When he saw that Hanno had been swept overboard, Kalbo dove into the water after him. From the bulwark, I watched as Kalbo grabbed his friend and swam back to us through the chopping waves with Hanno in tow. When the pair reached the ship, the crew hoisted them back onto the deck, where they lay down exhausted and weary. Hanno’s weariness soon left him, and he rose; but Kalbo did not rise again. By the time the ship’s chirugeon came, Kalbo’s breath had fled. All the healer could do was show us the wound – the tiny wound, naught but a nibble – that had envenomed and slain the hero.*

### Snake, Spitting Cobra

Spitting cobras are 3’ to 4’ long venomous serpents that are widely feared for their ability to spit venom at range. They are native to Shebatea, Kemesh, Opelenea, and Somirea. Like the viper, the cobra is revered as a symbol of the Chthonic gods in the Sunset Kingdoms and despised for the same reason in the east.

###### Combat

Spitting cobras have **acute olfaction** that grants them a +1 bonus to avoid surprise in their native habitat. They lack the heat-sensing organs of other snakes, however.

A spitting cobra can attack by biting its target or spitting at it. The cobra’s bite is **highly venomous**. Any creature damaged by the bite must make a successful Death saving throw or die at the end of the cobra’s initiative.

The cobra’s spit can be projected to a range of 10’. The spit deals no damage, but the creature struck must make a Death saving throw. If the save fails, the creature is permanently **blinded**. A *cure blindness* spell can reverse the effect.

###### Ecology

Spitting cobras sometimes congregate in dens during brumation or breeding season. When a den of spitting cobras is encountered, there is a 10% chance per cobra that it will be incubating a clutch of 2d20 eggs. The eggs have 1 hp and weight 1/1000 st (1 coin). Cobra snakelets are rarely found in nests, because the snakelets immediately disperse into the wild after they emerge from their eggs.

###### Spoils

A spitting cobra corpse can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following components useful in magic research:

* fangs (2/6 st, 7gp, *cause blindness, poison*)
* tongue (1/6 st, 6gp, *snakes to staffs, staffs to snakes*)

If not used for magic research, a spitting cobra’s fangs fetch 3gp and weigh 1/6 st. Its venom (onset time 1 turn, no saving throw modifier, 1d6 {Po} damage on failed Death saving throw) fetches 100gp if properly extracted.

###### Lair

A small cave mouth, obscured by tangled vines and thick underbrush, opens into a limestone cavern littered with shed snake skins, small bones, and scattered leaves. This is the den of **four spitting cobras.** The smallest cobra is a female that is incubating a clutch of **17 cobra eggs**.

**Spitting cobras (4):** Spd 90’, AC 2, HD 1\*, hp 8, 6, 4, 3, #AT 1 (bite or spit 10+), Dmg 1d3 {P} + poison or blindness, Save F1, ML -1, XP 13; Special: poison bite, poison spit

### Snake, Viper

Pit vipers are 4’ - 5’ long gray-green snakes renowned for their swift strikes and deadly venom. They are native to Shebatea, Somirea, Kemesh, Opelenea, Tirenea, and Nicea, and sometimes found in Krysea and Southern Argollë. In the Sunset Kingdoms, vipers are revered as symbols of the Chthonic gods, but in the Auran Empire they are seen as sinister and evil creatures to be killed on sight

###### Combat

Pit vipers have **acute olfaction** that grants them a +1 bonus to avoid surprise in their natural habitat.

Renowned for their speed, vipers have **lightning reflexes** that grant a +2 bonus to initiative. Any creature damaged by a pit viper’s bite must make a Death saving throw. If the save fails, the creature dies of **poison** 1d4+2 turns later.

###### Ecology

While pit vipers sometimes congregate in dens during brumation or breeding season, they do not exhibit any parental care for their offspring. Their young are born fully formed with functional venom glands. The precocious snakelets quickly disperse after birth.

###### Spoils

A slain pit viper with exceptional attributes can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following components useful in magic research:

* fangs (2/6 st., 18gp, *poison, swift sword*)
* tongue (2/6 st., 20gp, *snakes to staffs, staffs to snakes*)

If not used for magic research, a viper’s fangs fetch 4gp and weigh 1/6 st. Its venom (onset time 1d10 turns, +2 saving modifier, 2d6 {Po} damage on failed Death saving throw) fetches 125gp and weighs 1/6 st.

###### Encounter

A natural hollow has formed at the base of a towering tree, its roots twisted and turned over centuries to form a series of small caves and crevices below the trunk. The hollow is the nest of **four vipers**.

### Specter

Specters are powerful incorporeal undead that maintain their unholy existence by draining the life-force of the living. Some Chthonic cultists voluntary chose to become specters to await the Awakening. Others were cursed, punished, or otherwise damned to the state of undeath.

A specter looks much as it did just before its death, though it is weightless and slightly transparent. It can be easily recognized by those who knew the specter in life, or have seen its face in paintings or statues. If the specter’s mortal life ended violently, the terrible wounds that claimed its life will be visible on its ghostly body.

###### Combat

Specters are dreaded for their **enervating touch**. When a specter successfully attacks a living creature, it deals 1d8 {N!} damage to the creature, then permanently reduces the target’s maximum hp by an amount equal to the damage dealt. If the creature’s hp are reduced to 0, the creature is slain.

If not slain, the creature becomes **enervated**.An enervated creature must make a Death saving throw each day when it wakes from resting. If the save fails, the creature permanently reduces its maximum hp by another point. If the save succeeds, the creature does not reduce its maximum hp further that day. If a creature’s hp are reduced to 0 by the enervating touch, the creature is slain. if the save succeeds three times in a row, the condition ends. Otherwise, a creature can only end the condition and restore its maximum hp via ritual magic.

If a creature is slain by the enervating touch or enervated condition, it cannot be restored to life save by ritual magic*.* One day after the creature dies, it manifests as a **haunt** somewhere within 300’ of where it died (see p. XX).

Specters are **immune** to enchantment effects, necrotic damage, poisonous damage, and all mundane damage. As **incorporeal** beings, natural and non-magical weapons always deal mundane damage against them, even if the creature would otherwise deal extraordinary damage. They are inherently evil for purposes of *discern evil*and *holy circle*spells and are rebuked as specters.

###### Ecology

Specters are most commonly encountered in chaotic temples, places of death, and other sinkholes of evil. However, some haunt the homes of their own past lives, or wander the countryside in dismal pilgrimages.

A specter feeds on the life-energy released when a living creature becomes a haunt. If it does not create at least one haunt per month, it loses 1 HD. It can replenish lost HD by creating additional haunts. However, if ever reduced to 1 HD, the specter permanently becomes a haunt itself. A specter that resides in a sinkhole of evil can sustain itself from the ambient energies of the sinkhole and does not have to feed.

### Spell Tyrant

A spell tyrant, also known as a sorcerous sphere, is the abominable offspring of arcane experimentation. An adult spell tyrant resembles a floating sphere some 3’ in diameter and 820lbs in weight, with thick, gnarled, flesh pulsating with purple veins. The front of the sphere is set with a dozen pale eyes and multitude of maws with twisted fangs. Dotted around the sphere, six tentacle limbs twist obscenely, each tipped with a prehensile hand.

Though intelligent, malevolent, and megalomaniacal, spell tyrants are still capable of cooperating with evil allies or directing henchmen and underlings, when it furthers their interests. Even under duress, however, they are unwilling to bear the company of others of their kind.

###### Combat

An adult spell tyrant has all the abilities of a 12th-level Mage, including magic research, proficiencies, and item use. A spell tyrant can cast up to 3 spells simultaneously (1 spell per pair of limbs, for tyrants of other ages). Instead of casting spells, it can wield magical items instead. Its limbs are too weak to make effective physical attacks, however.

If forced into melee, adult spell tyrants can lunge and bite with 1d4 maws per round, dealing 1d4 {P!} damage with each. However, they engaging in physical combat reluctantly, and would rather strike with spells and magical items from a safe vantage point or distance.

Due to their ancestral memories, adult spell tyrants have Loremastery with a target value of 7+ (19 – HD for tyrants of other ages).

###### Ecology

Spell tyrants live solitary lives. Over their long lifespans, they continuously grow in size, adding additional eyes, mouths, and limbs. When they reach maximum age, they rupture into 6 baby sorcerous spheres, each with but a pair of vestigial limbs. The newborn spell tyros each retain a fraction of their former memories and spells; as they re-grow, they will remember more and more of their prior lives even as they accumulate new secrets and lore.

Spell tyrants are born remembering one language. Each time they gain a limb pair, they remember a new language.

### Sphinx

Majestic creatures crossbred or created in some bygone age, sphinxes have human heads, leonine bodies, and aquiline wings. They are found throughout Aurëpos, but are most common in Kemesh, Opelenea, and Nicea. Highly territorial, they often demand tribute or food from those that enter “their” realm. Those who can’t offer tribute are killed and eaten – but not right away. Sphinxes enjoy toying with victims, tricking them, engaging them in riddling contests, and so on.

Most sphinxes are Chaotic (60%) or Neutral (30%), but a small number (10%) are Lawful. Lawful sphinxes restrict their depredations to unintelligent or Chaotic prey. For a price, Lawful sphinxes have been known to offer their services as caravan guards along wilderness trails.

Because of their long lives, sphinxes accumulate vast stores of knowledge and lore. All sphinxes speak Common as well as 1d4 ancient or archaic languages such as Ancient Zaharan.

###### Combat

In combat, sphinxes attack with their terrible claws, which deal 2d10 {S!} damage each. Once every 3 rounds, in lieu of attacking with its claws, a sphinx can deliver a **terrifying roar** with the loudness of a *fireball*. Each creature in earshot (90’ in normal environments) must make a Paralysis saving throw. If the save fails, the creature becomes **frightened.** Even if the save succeeds, the creature **falters** if it has less than 5 HD. The condition lasts for 3 rounds, unless dispelled sooner.

Sphinxes enjoy **magic resistance** to spells and spell-like effects. When a sphinx is affected by a spell or spell-like effect, it can (but does not have to) make a magic resistance throw with a +5 bonus. If the result of the throw equals or exceeds the caster level of the spell or spell-like effect, the sphinx ignores it.

Each sphinx has a 20% chance to possess the spellcasting abilities of 12th level mage. Such noble sphinxes have an XP value 4,800 and a Treasure Type of Nx2

###### Ecology

Sphinxes often make their lairs in majestic ruins with desolate grandeur. They rate but once per century, always producing twin heiracubs – one male and one female. The heiracubs remain with their parents until adolescence.

When sphinxes are encountered in a wilderness lair, there is a 10% chance the adults will be rearing 2 heiracubs. Roll 1d4 to determine age: 1, they’re babies; 2-4, they’re juveniles. Juvenile sphinxes are large size, have AC 6, Spd 120’, HD 6, and attack with two claws (1d10 {S}). Baby sphinxes have AC 5, Spd 120’, HD 4, and attack with 2 claws (1d4 {S}). They cannot fly.

###### Spoils

### Spider, Giant Black Widow

Nasga, goddess of beauty and pain, bred the first giant spiders to help weave her web of suffering across the world. They are found in desolate ruins, dungeons, and forsaken wilderness throughout Aurëpos, Danae, and Ulruk.

The giant black widow is perhaps the most feared of its kind. Like its ordinary sibling, the giant black widow has a glossy black chitinous carapace marked with a red design resembling an hourglass on its ventral abdomen – but it measures 6' long and weighs 240 lbs.

###### Combat

Giant black widows are highly territorial and **very aggressive**. Characters encountering them suffer a -2 penalty on reaction rolls.

Giant black widows often spin webs in strategic locations around their lairs. They use these webs to entangle victims in their webs in order to capture them and keep them fresh for later consumption. They can also spin a web around a target as a melee attack. If a creature moves into a black widow’s web, it automatically becomes **webbed.** The black widows’ **webbed mechanoreception** enables them to “see” any creatures touching their webs.

Their bites carry a lethal **venom.** A creature damaged by a black widow’s bite must make a Death saving throw. If the save fails, the creature dies of poison after 1 turn.

###### Ecology

When a wilderness den of giant black widows is encountered, there is a 5% chance per spider that it will have constructed an egg sac containing 2d6+1 eggs. The eggs have 1 hp and weigh 1/12 st. Spiderlings disperse after birth and are not found in the den.

###### Spoils

A giant black widow corpse can be harvested with Animal Husbandry 2 for the following components useful in magic research:

* mandibles (2/6 st, 20gp, *poison*)
* leg tarsus (2/6 st, 25gp, *spider climb*)
* spinneret (2/6 st, 20gp, *webbing*)

If not used for magic research, a giant black widow’s mandibles fetch 12gp and weigh 1/6 st. Its venom (onset time 1d4 turns, +2 saving throw modifier, 4d4 {Po} damage on failed Death saving throw) fetches 250gp and weighs 1/6 st.

Like all arachnids, giant black widows are cunning enough to learn but so hostile as to be almost untrainable.

### Spider, Giant Crab

Nasga, goddess of beauty and pain, bred the first giant spiders to help weave her web of suffering across the world. They are found in desolate ruins, dungeons, and forsaken wilderness throughout Aurëpos, Danae, and Ulruk.

The giant crab spider is a 5' long carnivorous arachnid that weighs about 125 lbs. They are ambush predators that rely on their color-changing carapaces to surprise prey. Unlike black widows, they do not weave webs.

###### Combat

Giant crab spiders are **naturally** stealthy in their natural habitat, and creatures encountering them suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls.

Their bites carry a dangerous **venom.** A creature damaged by a giant crab spider’s bite must make a Death saving throw with a +2 bonus. If the save fails, the creature dies of poison after 1d4 turns have elapsed.

###### Ecology

When a wilderness den of giant crab spiders is encountered, there is a 5% chance per spider that it will have constructed an egg sac containing 3d6 eggs. The eggs have 1 hp and weigh 1/30 st. Spiderlings disperse after birth and are not found in the den.

###### Spoils

A giant crab spider monster corpse can be harvested with Animal Husbandry 2 for the following components useful in magic research:

* mandibles (1/6 st, 10gp, *poison*)
* leg tarsus (1/6 st, 10gp, *spider climb*)
* palps (1/6 st, 9gp, *chameleon*)

If not used for magic research, a giant crab spider’s mandibles fetch 8gp and weigh 1/6 st. Its venom (onset time 1d8 turns, +4 saving throw modifier, 2d6 poisonous damage on failed Death saving throw) fetches 100gp and weighs 1/6 st.

Like all arachnids, giant crab spiders are cunning enough to learn but so hostile as to be almost untrainable.

###### Encounter

A dense thicket of tall shrubs encircles a watering hole around 70’ in diameter. The watering hole is the hunting ground of **three crab spiders** who feed on any creatures that stop to drink. The crab spiders hide camouflaged in the shrubs, so characters encountering them suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls.

**Giant crab spiders (3):** Spd 120’, AC 2, HD 2\*\*, hp 12, 8, 6, #AT 1 (bite 9+), Dmg 1d8 +poison, Save F1, ML -1, AL N, XP 38; Special: poison bite (save v. Poison at +2 or die in 1d4 turns)

Among the remains of the spiders’ prey can be salvaged 14 antlers (10gp, 1 st each).

### Spider, Giant Tarantula

Nasga, goddess of beauty and pain, bred the first giant spiders to help weave her web of suffering across the world. They are found in desolate ruins, dungeons, and forsaken wilderness throughout Aurëpos, Danae, and Ulruk.

The tarantula is the largest of the giant arachnids, measuring 8' long and weighing 500 lbs. It has oily barbed hair all over its carapace that gives it a disturbingly fuzzy appearance. Like their ordinary cousins, giant tarantulas live in trees or silk-lined tunnels and excel at ambush.

###### Combat

Giant tarantulas are **naturally** stealthy in their natural habitat, and creatures encountering them suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls.

A giant tarantula can attack targets up to 30’ away by flinging the barbed hairs on its abdomen for 1d4 {P} damage. A creature damaged by a tarantula’s barb becomes **irritated** by a burning itch for 1 day or until healed by *cure light injury*. While irritated, the creature suffers a -2 penalty on attack and proficiency throws.

The bite of the giant tarantula is **highly toxic**. A creature damaged by a tarantula’s bite must make a Death saving throw. If the save fails, the creature dies of poison after 1 turn.

###### Ecology

When a wilderness den of giant tarantulas is encountered, there is a 5% chance per tarantula that it will have constructed an egg sac containing 1d2 eggs. The eggs have 1 hp and weigh 5/6 st. Spiderlings disperse after birth and are not found in the den.

###### Spoils

A giant tarantula corpse can be harvested with Animal Husbandry 2 for the following components useful in magic research:

* barded bristles (2 stone, 120gp, *mage missile, poison*)
* leg tarsus (4/6 st, 40gp, *spider climb*)
* spinneret (3/6 st, 30gp, *webbing*)

If not used for magic research, a giant tarantula’s mandibles fetch 8gp and weigh 1/6 st. Its venom (onset time 1d4 turns, +2 saving throw modifier, 3d10 {Po} damage on failed Death saving throw) fetches 375gp and weighs 1/6 st.

Like all arachnids, giant tarantula are cunning enough to learn but so hostile as to be almost untrainable – albeit somewhat easier than black widows and crab spiders.

### Squid, Giant

These voracious mollusks are aggressive predators that attack almost anything they meet. A typical giant squid has a mantle measuring 8’ long, two large tentacles measuring around 36’ long, and eight small tentacles measuring around 30’ long. The monstrous mollusks can weigh up to 1,500 lbs. Their eyes, almost a foot in diameter, glow brightly in the dark.

###### Combat

Giant squids have **acute vision** and **acute olfaction** granting them a +2 bonus to avoid surprise in their native habitat. Their fluid-filled statocysts grant them **aquatic mechanoreception** that enables them to “see” underwater to a range of 270’ (p. XX).

A giant squid can attack from up to 15’ away with its tentacles. Its large tentacles can attack vessels or creatures of large size or larger. Its smaller tentacles can attack any creatures within reach. A giant squid deals 1/3 structural damage to vessels.

A hit with a large tentacle deals 1d8 {B!} damage and **restrains** the creature or vessel. A hit with a small tentacle deals 1d4 {B!} damage and **restrains** the creature.

While a creature or vessel is restrained, the squid can automatically deal 1d8 (large tentacle) or 1d4 (small tentacle) {B!} damage on its initiative each round to the restrained creature or one-third that to the restrained vessel. Doing so counts as the squid’s attack with that tentacle.

A restrained creature cannot move but can still attack, cast spells, take actions in lieu of attacking, or attempt to escape. A restrained vessel cannot move, ram, or steer, but any crew can continue to act normally. The normal rules of the restrained condition (p. XX) otherwise apply.

To cut off a tentacle, an attack must deal at least 10 (large) or 6 (small) {S} damage to it in one blow. Any damage dealt beyond the required amount is not dealt to the squid (the tentacle was severed).

Once per day, a giant squid can use its combat action to create a 40' radius **cloud of black ink** around itself. The ink has the effect of a *tenebrosity* spell but it disperses into the water after 1 turn.

###### Ecology

Giant squid do not establish nests or exhibit any parental care for their offspring. After being inseminated, a female squid attaches a gelatinous mass of eggs to seafloor, seaweed, or rocks. The mass of squid eggs has 1 hp and weighs 1 3/6 st.

###### Spoils

A slain giant squid can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following components useful in magic research:

* radial muscles (8 2/6 st, 500gp, *swift sword*)
* ink sac (10 st, 600gp, *shrouding fog, tenebrosity*)
* tentacles (8 2/6 st, 500gp, *choking grip, sunder structure*)

### Statue, Animated Bronze

Statues of various materials can be made into constructs by powerful spellcasters. Those forged of bronze appear as ordinary cast-bronze figures of mighty heroes and warriors with weapons and shields standing 6’ to 7’ tall and weighing 450 lbs.

###### Combat

Unless they engage in some form of movement, animated statues appear to be normal statues even upon close inspection. Characters encountering stationary animated statues suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls.

Animated bronze statues are **immune** to enchantment effects, necrotic damage, poisonous damage, and mundane bludgeoning, slashing, and piercing damage. They are **resistant** to extraordinary bludgeoning, slashing, and piercing damage.

However, every bronze statue has a **weak point** (such as its ankle, armpit, neck, etc.). Identifying a statue’s weak point requires an action in lieu of attacking and a successful Searching proficiency throw. Characters with Craft (armorer) or Engineering proficiency gain a +4 bonus to identify a statue’s weak point.

Once it is identified, attacks may be directed against a statue’s weak point, albeit at a -4 penalty due to its small size. Any successful attacks targeted at a statue’s weak point bypass its immunities and resistances to deal full damage, and an unmodified attack throw of 20 with a weapon targeted at a statue’s weak point instantly destroys it.

Animated bronze statues count as enchanted creatures for purposes of spells such as *dispel evil*and *holy circle*.

###### Ecology

As constructs, bronze animated statues have no natural habitat. They can be found guarding ancient treasures, dwarven vaults, or places of power or serving powerful spellcasters.

###### Spoils

A destroyed bronze statue can be harvested with Magical Engineering for the following component useful in magic research:

* bronze slag (6 st., 350gp, *physical protection (bludgeoning, piercing slashing*), armor +1, weapon +1)

###### Lore

*Of the great wonders of the world, the Colossus of Corcano is perhaps the most mysterious. The sages of the Tower of Knowledge have come to no agreement as to the identity of its maker nor the date of its creation. Many believe it must predate the Day Without Night. The sages do agree, however, that the Colossus is neither an automaton or a golem but instead an animated bronze statue of prodigious size…*

* Basilio, *Wonders of the World*

### Statue, Animated Chryselephantine

Statues of various materials can be made into constructs by powerful spellcasters. Those made of chryselephantine are usually sculpted to resemble gods, titans, and heroes with larger-than-life statures standing 8’ to 10’ in height and weighing 900 lbs. They are built with wooden frames that are set with thin slabs of ivory (to represent flesh) and sheets of gold leaf (to represent armor, hair, and garments).

###### Combat

Unless they engage in some form of movement, animated chryselephantine statues appear to be normal statues even upon close inspection. Characters encountering stationary animated statues suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls.

A chryselephantine statue attacks by hurling **bolts of lightning** that can strike a single target within 240’ for 3d10 {E!} damage.

In lieu of hurling lightning a chryselephantine animated statue may utter a **thundering threat**. The exact phrasing of the threat is defined by the statue’s creator, e.g. “death to those who dare disturb this holy place!” Each creature within 30’ of the statue when it issues its threat must make a Blast saving throw. If the save fails, the creature suffers 1d6 {Se!} damage and is **deafened**. If the save succeeds, the creature suffers half damage but is not deafened (though its ears may ache and ring). A deafened creature suffers a -2 penalty to surprise rolls and has a 2 in 6 chance of failing any attempt to cast a spell, read a scroll, or utter a command word, but is immune to additional thundering threats. A deafened creature can make another saving throw at the end of its initiative each round. If the save succeeds, it is no longer deafened (and it becomes vulnerable to thundering threat again). The noise of a thundering threat automatically triggers an encounter throw for wandering monsters (if any) and may alert nearby guards or allies.

Chryselephantine statues are **immune** to enchantment effects, electrical damage, necrotic damage, and poisonous damage. As constructs, they count as enchanted creatures for purposes of spells such as *dispel evil*and *holy circle*.

###### Ecology

As constructs, animated chryselephantine statues have no natural habitat. They can be found guarding ancient treasures, dwarven vaults, or places of power or serving powerful spellcasters.

###### Spoils

A destroyed chryselephantine statue can be harvested with Magical Engineering for the following component useful in magic research:

* wooden frame (18 1/3 st., 1100gp, *call lightning, energy invulnerability (electricity), energy protection (electricity), inspire awe, thunderbolt*)

### Statue, Animated Crystal

Statues of various materials can be made into constructs by powerful spellcasters. Those sculpted from crystal appear as smoothly-carved humas or demi-humans, standing about 6’ tall and weighing about 500 lbs.

###### Combat

Unless they engage in some form of movement, animated crystal statues appear to be normal statues even upon close inspection. Characters encountering stationary animated statues suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls.

In combat, animated crystal statues strike with their fists for 1d6 {B} damage.

Animated crystal statues are **immune** to enchantment effects, necrotic damage, and poisonous damage. As constructs, they count as enchanted creatures for purposes of spells such as *dispel evil*and *holy circle*.

###### Ecology

As constructs, animated crystal statues have no natural habitat. They can be found guarding ancient treasures, dwarven vaults, or places of power or serving powerful spellcasters.

###### Spoils

A destroyed crystal statue can be harvested with Magical Engineering for the following component useful in magic research:

* crystal skull (1 stone, 65gp, *divine armor, holy circle*)

###### Encounter

A narrow cave mouth perforates the side of a nearby hill. Adventurers who squeeze through the narrow rift find themselves, not in a limestone cavern, but in a spectacular egg-shaped geode cavity where great shards of scintillating crystal jut from the walls the teeth of some monstrous maw. Those able to sense power will instantly recognize that they have entered an **enduring edifice of elemental earth**.

However, the edifice has been damaged. The far wall of the cavity, opposite the entrance, shows signs of having been excavated, with jagged gouges and bare patches of rock. The fruit of that excavations stands in the center of the geodesic: a crystal statue chiseled to resemble a stately elven lord. Scattered around the feet of the statue are ancient bones and rusty sculptor’s tools.

The bones are all that remains of the mage who excavated and sculpted the crystal. He had hoped to make it into an **animated crystal statue**, but he died of old age before completing the project. The unfathomable power of elemental earth finished the job for him. The statue will attack any beings who touch the crystals in the cave.

### Statue, Animated Iron

Statues of various materials can be made into constructs by powerful spellcasters. As no natural fire in Aurëpos can burn hot enough to cast iron, animated iron statues are actually built with wooden frames that are set with thin iron plates, hammered into shape and riveted to the frame. They usually resemble 6’ warriors in lamellar or plate armor. They weigh around 1,275 lbs.

###### Combat

Unless they engage in some form of movement, animated iron statues appear to be normal statues even upon close inspection. Characters encountering stationary animated statues suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls.

In combat, animated iron statues strike with their fists for 1d8 {B} damage. Some iron statutes might be constructed with weapons in their hands, dealing 1d8 {W} damage.

Animated iron statues can have a **magnetic effect** on metal weapons. When an attack damages an animated iron statue with non-magical metal weapons, the attacker must make a Spells saving throw. If the throw fails, the weapon becomes lodged on the statue. A lodged weapon can only be retrieved by destroying the statue. If the save succeeds, the attacker retains his weapon.

Animated iron statues are **immune** to enchantment effects, necrotic damage, and poisonous damage. As constructs, they count as enchanted creatures for purposes of spells such as *dispel evil*and *holy circle*.

###### Ecology

As constructs, animated iron statues have no natural habitat. They can be found guarding ancient treasures, dwarven vaults, or places of power or serving powerful spellcasters.

###### Spoils

A destroyed iron statue can be harvested with Magical Engineering for the following component useful in magic research:

* iron head (2 2/6 st, 135gp, *deflect ordinary weapons, shatter blade*)

###### Encounter

An 100’ long, 80’ wide oval-shaped expanse of flat, level ground sits at the base of a series of grassy terraces that descend like steps from a height of some 30’. The ground of the oval expanse is overgrown with grass and shrubs, but here and there can be seen the glint of metal amongst the vegetation. In the middle of the oval stands an iron statue of a gladiator wearing heavy arena armor, heavy helmet, a pair of short swords. The statue looks heavily damaged.

The oval expense was once a gladiatorial arena and the grassy terraces are the remains of the stone seats that encircled it. The gladiator in the middle of the arena is an **animated iron statue**. It attacks any creature that attacks it or that carries weapons into the arena**.**

### Statue, Animated Stone

Statues of various materials can be made into constructs by powerful spellcasters. Those sculpted of stone usually appear as statues of kings, priests, mages, and nobles. They stand around 6’ tall and weigh around 440 lbs.

###### Combat

Unless they engage in some form of movement, animated stone statues appear to be normal statues even upon close inspection. Characters encountering stationary animated statues suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls.

Though animated stone statues appear to be made simply of some kind of stone (alabaster, granite, limestone, porphyry or sandstone are most common), inside the statue there is a large pocket of melted rock and molten lava. In combat, the animated stone statue project this **burning lava** from its fingertips for 2d6 {F!} damage.

Animated stone statues are **immune** to enchantment effects, fire damage, necrotic damage, and poisonous damage. As constructs, they count as enchanted creatures for purposes of spells such as *dispel evil*and *holy circle*.

###### Ecology

As constructs, animated stone statues have no natural habitat. They can be found guarding ancient treasures, dwarven vaults, or places of power or serving powerful spellcasters.

###### Spoils

A destroyed stone statue can be harvested with Magical Engineering for the following component useful in magic research:

* lava slag (5 5/6 st, 350gp, *fan of flame, fireball*)

###### Encounter

Al that remains of the Empyrean temple that once occupied this site is a circular naos of polished white marble surrounded on its perimeter by a ring of tall limestone columns. The roof the columns once supported has collapsed, shattering three of the seven alabaster statues. The four remaining statues – an emperor in a muscle cuirass, a bladedancer in a breastwrap and cloak, a matron in a flowing robe, and a young man in a traveler’s cloak – are recognizable to those with Theology proficiency as statues of Ammonar, Ianna, Mityara, and Naurivus. All fourare **animated stone statues**, and they will attack any creature that fails to present a Lawful holy symbol.

If the rubble of the collapsed roof is removed (a 1gp construction project), the remains of the temple sanctuary are uncovered. A portion of the temple’s treasury still remains within, including 2000sp, 3000gp, and a whitewood scroll case with a *scroll of cure serious injury, restore life and limb,* and *prophetic dream* written in Classical Auran.

### Strix

A strix (plural striges) resembles a cross between a bat and an owl. It has a large head with forward-facing eyes and a hook beak with grey-white bat wings. Its body is about 2’ long, with a wingspan of about 5', and a weight around 9 lbs. Like a bat, a strix is a nocturnal predator that rests hanging upside down by day and hunts by night. Striges are considered birds of ill omen in Nicean legend and harbingers of war in Tirenean myth.

###### Combat

Striges navigate and hunt with **echolocation** (600’ range). No spells or effects that would ordinarily blind a creature will affect a strix, but *inaudible* creatures are hidden from them, and *noiselessness* blinds them.

If a strix damages a target with its beak, the strix latches onto the target and begins **drinking blood**. Once latched on, the strix can use its combat action to automatically deal another 1d3 {N} damage to the creature each round.

Creatures that are having their blood drunk by a strix can still move, but count as carrying an extra stone of encumbrance. The strix moves with the creature it is latched onto. A strix will remain attached to a target until the target dies or the strix is killed.

###### Ecology

When striges are encountered in their nest, there is a 75% chance the adults will be rearing offspring. Roll 1d4 for age and number: 1-2 it’s 3d6 eggs, 3-4 it’s 1d8 hatchlings. Hatchling striges have AC 0, Spd 30’, 1 hp, ML -4, and do not fight. Strige eggs have 1 hp and weigh 1/100 st.

###### Spoils

A slain striges can harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the following components useful in magic research:

* hooked beak (1/6 st., 3gp, *life transfer*)
* wingtips (1/6 st., 3gp, *flight*)

A strix’s 6d10 flight feathers each fetch 1d2sp and weigh 1/225 st.

###### Encounter

A narrow crevice breaks the rock face along the only path through a torturously-sloped broken ridge. The area around the crevice is littered with the bones and carcasses of dead animals and humanoids. A character with Animal Husbandry or Healing proficiency that inspects the dead creatures will discover they were all drained of blood from tiny puncture wounds. A thorough search of the remains (1 turn) will unearth a wrought gold necklace set with garnets (900gp) and a pair of jade earrings shaped like dangling dragons (1,100gp). Searching characters will be attacked after 1d6 rounds by the **16 striges** who lair in the crevice.

### Stymph

Stymphs are rapacious man-eating cranes with brazen beaks and feathers. They stand about 3’ tall and have a wingspan of around 6’ and weight of about 15lbs.

###### Combat

Stymphs have **acute vision** and gain a +1 bonus to avoid surprise in its natural habitat.

A stymph’s flight feathers can be flung like darts to wound their prey. A stymph can throw two flight feathers per round while airborne. Flight feathers can hit targets up to 180’ away (no range penalties apply) and deal 1d4 {P} damage each. A stymph can throw up to 6 flight feathers without losing its capability to fly; a stymph will typically have 2d3 feathers available at the start of an encounter. Once a stymph has flung all of its available feathers, it will attack its prey in melee with its beak. The beak is armor-piercing, granting a +2 bonus to the stymph’s attack throws.

Despite their ferocity, stymphs are easily frightened (reflected in their low morale score of -2).

###### Ecology

The stymph’s legendary rapacity is due to the high metabolic cost of replacing its feathers. A well-fed stymph can regrow flung feathers at a rate of two per day; a hungry stymph will be lucky to replace one per month. Stymphs have been known to collect and consume small bits of metal such as coins, daggers, and ingots, but whether this is vital to the re-growth of their feathers is not known to the sages of Aurëpos.

Like most birds, stymphs congregate in flocks and nests. When stymphs are encountered in their nest, there is a 75% chance the adults will be rearing offspring. Roll 1d10 for age and number: 1 it’s 4d10 eggs, 2-10 it’s 2d10 hatchlings. Hatchling stymphs have AC 0, Spd 30’, 1hp, ML -4, and do not fight. Stymph eggs have 1 hp and weigh 1/25 st.

###### Spoils

A slain stymphs can harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the following components useful in magic research:

* beak (1/6 st, 7gp, weapon +1)
* flight feathers (1/6 st, 6gp, *flight, mage missile, regeneration*)

If not used for magic research, a stymph’s 6d10 flight feathers each fetch 1d2sp and weigh 1/225 st.

###### Encounter

A sprawling network of intertwined branches, brazen feathers, and scraps of metal armor clings to a cliff’s rocky outcrops and ledges. The sprawl is home to a storm of **26 stymphs**, which have made a nest here to raise **12 hatchling stymphs**.

**Stymphs (26):** Sped 30’ / 240’ fly, AC 5, HD 1\*, hp 5 each, #AT 2 (feathers 10+) or 1 (bite 10+), Dmg 1d4 {P} or 1d6 {P}, Save F2, ML -2, XP 13

The stymph’s nest incorporates a number of bits and pieces of metallic treasure, including 14,000cp, 8,000sp, and a shiny hauberk of *chain mail +1*. Since the nest is over 100’ up the side of the cliff, extracting the treasure from it will be a difficult challenge for adventurers that lack the ability to levitate or fly.

### Swarm, Bat

A bat swarm is a large mass of flying, flapping, biting bats. A bat swarm might be roused if its nest or feeding ground is invaded, if it is presented with strange smells or bright lights, or if summoned by magic.

###### Combat

Bat swarms are **prone to flight** and the swarm must make a morale roll at the end of every round of any combat.

Bat swarms do not so much attack as simply engulf everything in their path. Any creature that starts its initiative in the swarm’s area, or enters the swarm on its initiative, is **engulfed.**

A creature engulfed by a bat swarm must make a Paralysis saving throw at the end of its initiative. If the save fails, the creature suffers 1d6 {P} damage and is **mad** (as the spell *incite madness*) on its next initiative. If, on its initiative, the engulfed creature uses its movement action to flee from the swarm at least 20’, or uses its combat action to ward off the swarm with a torch or weapon, it gains a +4 bonus on its saving throw. Warding off a bat swarm with a torch or weapon deals 1d4 damage to the swarm.

The engulfed condition ends when the creature starts its initiative outside the area of the swarm.

Bat swarms are **immune** to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, except when dealt by creatures warding off the bats (e.g. the bat swarm cannot be directly attacked as a target).

###### Ecology

Bat swarms are commonly found in abandoned belfries and towers, caverns, forests, jungles and other environments favored by bats.

###### Spoils

Bat swarms do not yield any spoils except meat. One day their guano will be valuable, but that day is not today.

###### Encounter

A funnel-shaped pit entrance on the lower slopes of a mountain, 40’ in diameter, descends downward 154’ feet before opening up into a cavernous vault, 1,000’ long, 200’ wide, and 80’ high. The ceiling of this vast cave is adorned with beautiful tubular stalactites, which hang like icicles between larger floor-to-ceiling columns. A roost of **three huge bat swarms** makes its lair in this cavern. The bats emerge at sunset and return at sunrise. If characters are ascending or descending the 154’ shaft during this time, they will be caught within the swarm, and will fall if they fail their saving throw.

**Huge bat swarms (3):** Spd 15’ / 120’ fly, AC 2, HD 4\*, hp 24, 21, 17, #AT 1 (engulf), Dmg 1d6 {P} + mad, Save F0, ML -2, AL N, XP 135; Special: prone to flight, swarm immunities

###### Note

For a swarm of crows, ravens, or other murderous birds, use the same characteristics as a bat swarm but replace Echolocation with Acute Vision.

### Swarm, Fish

A fish swarm is a large school of carnivorous fish such as bluefish, barracudas, jackfish, mackerel, or piranhas. A fish swarm might be roused into a feeding frenzy by the smell of blood or unusual stimuli in the water.

###### Combat

Fish swarms have **acute olfaction.** They gain a +1 bonus to avoid surprise in their natural habitat.

A fish swarm spreads over a watery volume of 1000 cubic feet per HD. A 2 HD swarm is usually 20’ x 10’ x 10’, a 3 HD swarm is 30’ x 10’ x 10’, and a 4 HD swarm is 20’ x 20’ x 10’. However it can expand or shrink by 50% in either direction as conditions merit.

Fish swarms do not so much attack as simply engulf everything in their path. Any creature that starts its initiative in the swarm’s area, or enters the swarm on its initiative, is **engulfed.**

If an engulfed creature is required to make a Swimming throw at the start of its initiative to avoid drowning, the creature’s throw suffers a -1 penalty per HD of the fish swarm that has engulfed him.

A creature engulfed by a fish swarm suffers 2 {P} damage, or 4 {P} damage if the engulfed creature is unarmored and has a natural AC of 3 or less. If the engulfed creature is drowning, it suffers double damage. The damage is dealt to the engulfed creature at the end of its initiative.

If, on its initiative, the engulfed creature uses its movement action to flee from the swarm at least 20’, or uses its combat action to ward off the swarm with a weapon, it reduces the damage it suffers from the swarm by half. Warding off a fish swarm with a weapon also deals 1d4 damage to the swarm.

The engulfed condition ends when the creature starts its initiative outside the area of the swarm.

Fish swarms are **immune** to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, except when dealt by creatures warding off the fish (e.g. the fish swarm cannot be directly attacked as a target).

###### Ecology

Fish are found everywhere and so are fish swarms. The specific type of fish can vary depending on the terrain and circumstances of the encounter.

###### Spoils

Fish swarms do not yield any spoils except fish.

### Swarm, Insect

An insect swarm is a large mass of small insects, such as bees, ants, wasps, spiders, and other small biting and stinging bugs that crawl or fly. An insect swarm might be roused if its nest or feeding ground is invaded, if it is presented with strange smells or bright lights, or if summoned by magic.

###### Combat

An insect swarm spreads over an area of 100 square feet per HD. A 2 HD swarm is usually 20’ x 10’, a 3 HD swarm is 20’ x 15’, and a 4 HD swarm is 20’ x 20’. However it can expand or shrink by 50% in either direction as conditions merit.

Insect swarms do not so much attack as simply engulf everything in their path. Any creature that starts its initiative in the swarm’s volume, or enters the swarm on its initiative, is **engulfed.**

A creature engulfed by an insect swarm suffers 2 {P} damage or 4 {P} damage if the engulfed creature is unarmored and has a natural AC of 3 or less. The damage is dealt to the engulfed creature at the end of its initiative. If, on its initiative, the engulfed creature uses its movement action to flee from the swarm at least 20’, or uses its combat action to ward off the swarm with a torch or weapon, it reduces the damage it suffers from the swarm by half. Warding off an insect swarm with a torch also deals 1d4 fire damage to the swarm.

The engulfed condition ends when the creature starts its initiative outside the area of the swarm. When the engulfed condition ends, the creature becomes **vexed** by bites from lingering insects. A vexed creature suffers 1 piercing damage, or 2 piercing damage if it is unarmored and has a natural AC of 3 or less, at the end of its initiative each round. The vexed condition ends immediately if the creature becomes engulfed or submerges itself in a body of water. Otherwise it ends after 3 rounds.

Characters damaged by an insect swarm have a 5% chance of becoming infected with a disease. The Judge should roll 1d100 on the Disease table (p. XX) to determine the disease and its effects. *Cure disease* is, of course, effective in eliminating this illness.

Insect swarms are **immune** to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.

###### Ecology

Insects are found everywhere and so are insect swarms. The specific type of insect can vary depending on the terrain and circumstances of the encounter.

###### Spoils

Insect swarms do not yield any spoils except shellmeat.

### Swarm, Rat

A rat swarm consists of hundreds of ordinary rats. A rat swarm might be roused if its nest or feeding ground is invaded, if it is presented with strange smells or bright lights, or if summoned by magic.

###### Combat

A rat swarm spreads over an area of 100 square feet per HD. A 2 HD swarm is usually 20’ x 10’, a 3 HD swarm is 20’ x 15’, and a 4 HD swarm is 20’ x 20’. However it can expand or shrink by 50% in either direction as conditions merit.

Rat swarms do not so much attack as simply engulf everything in their path. Any creature that starts its initiative in the swarm’s area, or enters the swarm on its initiative, is **engulfed.**

A creature engulfed by a rat swarm must make a Paralysis saving throw at the end of its initiative. If the save fails, the creature takes 1d6 {P} damage and is knocked **prone**. If the save succeeds, the creature takes half that damage and keeps its footing. If, on its initiative, the engulfed creature uses its movement action to flee from the swarm at least 20’, or uses its combat action to ward off the swarm with a torch or weapon, it gains a +4 bonus on its saving throw. Warding off a rat swarm with a torch or weapon also deals 1d4 damage to the swarm.

The engulfed condition ends when the creature starts its initiative outside the area of the swarm. Unlike insect swarms, rat swarms do not cause creatures to become vexed.

Characters damaged by a rat swarm have a 5% chance of becoming infected with a disease. The Judge should roll 1d100 on the Disease table (p. XX) to determine the disease and its effects. *Cure disease* is, of course, effective in eliminating this illness.

Rat swarms are **immune** to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, except when dealt by creatures warding off the rats (e.g. the rat swarm cannot be directly attacked as a target).

###### Ecology

Rat swarms are commonly found in abandoned granaries, catacombs, graveyards, sewers, and other indoor or subterranean environments with ample food for the rats.

###### Spoils

Rat swarms do not yield any spoils except meat.

###### Encounter

Running below the terrain here is an extensive burrow of 2”-3” diameter tunnels. A 6”-wide rat hole, spotted as a secret door due to its covering of plant mulch and debris, is the primary entrance to the burrow; two smaller 3” rat holes, separated by about 300’, serve as secondary exits. The burrow is the den of **seven rat swarms.** The rats are unlikely to exit their burrow en masse unless provoked or smoked out.

### Thrassian (Greater Lizardman)

Thrassians stand 7’ to 8’ tall, resembling massive lizardmen with large heads characterized by prominent and protruding fangs and glowing yellow eyes. Dragon-like wings erupt from their shoulder blades, giving them crude flight capabilities.

Magically bred from a cross of men and giant lizards long ago by unknown arcanists, the Thrassians once held much of Aurëpos and Ulruk in their scaly claws. Such was their power that primitive man worshiped them as gods and served them as slaves. Yet from this height, the Thrassian people fell to abyssal lows. Some taint in the Thrassian bloodline caused them to slowly degenerate into primitive savagery. Had they been kinder to their subject peoples, the Thrassians might have slipped into obscurity peacefully. Instead, they were violently overthrown by the Zaharans, who seized power from their former masters and formed their own dark empire.

Of the handful of Thrassians that survived the Zaharan uprising, most fled to the outlying swamps and jungles, where they continued their devolution to the primitive lizardmen of today. The few true Thrassians that presently exist are slaves sorcerously bred for the amusement of Kemeshi nobles. The time of the Thrassians has passed.

Or has it? The lizardmen claim it is yet to come. Their scaly shamans teach that the greatest of the Thrassian priest-kings escaped the wrath of the Zaharans, and even now slumbers in a hidden vault; and that when he awakens, he shall stride forth with a legion of Thrassian warriors and lead his children to restore the empire of old. The sages deem this a fable, merely the lizardmen’s version of the Chthonic myth of the Awakening. If it were true, however, and one of the Thrassian tyrants of old did return, then the shores of the Ammas Aurë would become an abattoir, as the Thrassians avenged a thousand years of humiliation with blood and slaughter.

Thrassians speak their own language, known to humans as Ancient Thrassian, as well as the debased dialect of Thrassian spoken by lizardmen. Thrassians have a 10% chance per HD of speaking Common or another language used in their region.

###### Combat

Thrassians typically fight with their claws and fangs, but sometimes wield weapons, favoring tridents (pole arms) for battlefield formations and javelins for aerial skirmishing. Their immense strength grants them a +3 damage bonus. (This has already been factored into their natural attacks). They typically wear partial leather or hide armor atop their thick, scaly hides.

###### Ecology

Thrassians are the natural leaders of lizardmen, and are rarely encountered without a substantial force of followers and servants. A solitary Thrassian has a 75% chance to be guarded by 1d8 lizardman champions and 5d8 lizardman warriors. A Thrassian has a 10% chance of either shaman or mage abilities at level 4.

When Thrassians are encountered in a dominion, there will be 1d8 lizardmen champions and 5d8 lizardman warriors serving *each* Thrassian. The Thrassians and their lizardmen followers will collectively be led by a Thrassian dominator with 9 AC, 8+1 HD, 40 hp, and a +4 damage bonus (+2 with natural attacks).

A dominator will have either shaman (75%) or mage (25%) abilities at level 8. A dominator will possess magic items in addition to any held by the dominion, as an 8th level NPC. As long as the dominator is alive, the dominion’s members gain a +2 bonus to morale rolls.

Due to the degeneration of their species, only Thrassian dominators of the male sex remain fertile, and even they cannot always reliably perpetuate their kind. Thrassian dominions will have 15 lizardman females and 15 eggs for every Thrassian. If properly tended, 5% of a dominion’s eggs will hatch into Thrassians, 20% will hatch into lizardman champions, and the remaining 75% will hatch into ordinary lizardmen.

According to legend, Thrassian dominators are themselves commanded by Thrassian tyrants, though such a creature has not been seen in over a thousand years. If encountered, a tyrant has 10 AC, 11+1 HD, 55 hp, and a +5 damage bonus (+3 with natural attacks). All tyrants are spellcasters, with either shaman (75%) or mage (25%) abilities at level 11. (Some tyrants achieved even greater power as undead, after the flesh…) Like dominators, tyrants will possess magic items, as 11th level NPCs.

Thrassian tyrants who unite with lizardmen can reliably breed fertile Thrassians. Should a tyrant emerge, the ancient and evil race could replenish its ranks.

###### Spoils

A slain Thrassian can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 2 for the following component useful in magic research:

* eyes (1 1/6 st., 70gp, *dominate humanoid, lightless vision*)
* wings (1 1/6 st, 70gp, *ogre strength, winged flight*)

Leaders have more valuable components. The eyes and wings of Thrassian shamans fetch 112gp and weigh 1 5/6 st each. The eyes and wings of Thrassian mages fetch 140gp and weigh 2 2/6 st each. Dominator shamans have eyes and wings worth 550gp and weighing 9 1/6 st each. Dominator mages have eyes and wings worth 800gp and weighing 13 2/6 st each. Tyrant shamans have eyes and wings worth 3,600gp and weighing 60 st. Tyrant mages have eyes and wings worth 5,200gp and weighing 86 4/6 st.

###### Lore

*The contrast between the High Thrassian civilization of antiquity and the primitive lizardmen of our own day could not be greater. The lizardman is a naked savage, a wielder of sticks and stones, living in rude huts in fetid swamps. The Thrassians donned resplendent armor, carried weapons of bronze and iron, spoke a sophisticated tongue, and had mastered sorcery to an extent unmatched by any empire before or since.*

*Today only their ruins linger on, crumbling temples and strange spires built by clawed hands, with alien proportions not fit for warm-blooded life. Where did the Thrassians come from, and what destroyed them?*

* *Megaravicos,* *Of the Reptiles and their Ways*

### Tick, Giant

The giant tick is a monstrous man-sized blood-sucking arachnid about that weighs 125 to 380 lbs. Like giant spiders, giant ticks were created by Nasga to spread suffering throughout the world. They are found throughout the forests and swamps of Aurëpos, where they lurk motionless until their keen senses of smell, heat, and moisture detect potential prey nearby.

Unlike their microscopic cousins, which often pursue their entire life cycle parasitically attached to a single host creature, giant ticks tend to kill their hosts quickly. They then retreat to the safety of their dens, usually muddy holes or damp tree hollows, until they need to feed again.

###### Combat

Giant ticks have **acute olfaction** that grants them a +1 bonus to avoid surprise in their natural habitat. They are **naturally stealthy**, and creatures encountering them in their natural habitat suffer a -1 penalty to surprise rolls.

Giant ticks attack by plunging a harpoon-like hypostome into its target, dealing 1d4 {P} damage. If a giant tick damages a target with its hypostome, the giant tick latches onto it and begins **draining blood**.Once latched on, the tick can use its combat action to automatically deal 1d4 {N} damage to the creature each round. Creatures that are having their blood drained by a giant tick can still move, but count as carrying extra stone of encumbrance equal to its weight. The tick moves with the creature from which it is drinking blood. Unless burned, killed, or suffocated by submersion in water, a giant tick will not let go of a victim until it has dealt necrotic damage equal to its own maximum hit point total.

Creatures who have had their blood drained by a giant tick have a 50% probability of contracting an ordinary (but dangerous) disease. The Judge should roll 1d100-10 on the Disease table (***ACKS II JJ****,* p. XX) to determine the disease and its effects. *Cure disease* is, of course, effective in eliminating this illness.

###### Ecology

When a wilderness infestation of giant ticks is encountered, there is a 5% chance per tick that it will have dispersed 2d6+1 eggs nearby. The eggs have 1 hp and weigh 2/6 st. The larvae disperse after birth and are not found in the den.

###### Spoils

A slain giant tick can be harvested with Animal Husbandry 2 for the following components useful in magic research:

### Titan, Greater

The sage of the Auran Empire believe that the titans are the primordial offspring of the gods – some say the illicit offspring of Türas and Telith, others fastened by the will of Ammonar, only to be cast down to earth when they threatened his power. The titans themselves claim that they sprang from blood shed by the gods during the battle for the Tablet of Destiny. Whatever their origin, the titans are an awe-inspiring and powerful race taller and nobler than giants.

Greater titans stand 22’ tall and weigh 7,500lbs. They have blue-tinted black hair, cloud-grey eyes, and skin in tones of bronze ranging from a light tan to a lustrous copper. They wear flowing clothing and fancy jewelry. In battle, they wield great spears or giant falx with polished bronze blades.

Greater titans always speak Common, Classical Auran, and 1d6 other tongues, often ancient or dead languages.

###### Combat

Titans can smash with their fists or with weapons for extraordinary damage. When smashing with piercing or slashing weapons, titans deliver **vicious blows** that deal an additional 6 points per smash. When smashing with bludgeoning weapons, titans can **topple and fling** large or smaller creatures with every attack (p. XX). The creature struck must make a successful size-adjusted Paralysis saving throw or be knocked prone and forced back a number of feet equal to the damage dealt. The titan can cleave if the creature fails its save against his smash.

Instead of smashing, titans can hurl boulders to a distance of 1200’, dealing 4d6 {B!} damage in a 5’ radius to the impact point. When hurling a boulder, a titan functions like a heavy ballista using the rules for Missile Attacks with Artillery (***ACKS II RR****,* p. XX). However, the titan does not need to reload, so it can throw a boulder each round if it has sufficient ammo.

Greater titans can **summon weather**(as the spell) at will. During thunder storms, they can use a combat action to unleash a 15d6 {E!} damage **lightning strike** *(as the spell)* every round. They are **immune** to electric damage. All great titans can **breathe water** (as the spell) as well as air.

There is a 30% chance a greater titan will have Mage abilities at level 2d6+1.

###### Ecology

Though sometimes found in dungeons, greater titans usually dwell in mountain citadels on high peaks, in sky-castles atop clouds, or in submarine strongholds below the sea. They protect their lairs with trained creatures of various types: in a mountain citadel, these will be 2d4 griffons; in a sky castle, 1d3 large rocs; in a submarine stronghold, 3d6 giant crabs.

###### Spoils

A slain greater titan can be harvested with Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the following component useful in magic research:

### Titan, Lesser

The sage of the Auran Empire believe that the titans are the primordial offspring of the gods – some say the illicit offspring of Türas and Telith, others fastened by the will of Ammonar, only to be cast down to earth when they threatened his power. The titans themselves claim that they sprang from blood shed by the gods during the battle for the Tablet of Destiny. Whatever their origin, the titans are an awe-inspiring and powerful race taller and nobler than giants.

Lesser titans stand 20’ tall and weigh 5,000lbs with bronze or silver hair and skin in tones of blue ranging from nearly white to cold light blue. They dress in flowing clothing and fancy jewelry. In battle, they favor tall spears or gleaming maces.

Lesser titans always speak Common, Classical Auran, and 1d4 other tongues, often ancient or dead languages.

###### Combat

Titans can smash with their fists or with weapons for extraordinary damage. When smashing with piercing or slashing weapons, titans deliver **vicious blows** that deal an additional 6 points per smash. When smashing with bludgeoning weapons, titans can **topple and fling** large or smaller creatures with every attack (p. XX). The creature struck must make a successful size-adjusted Paralysis saving throw or be knocked prone and forced back a number of feet equal to the damage dealt. The titan can cleave if the creature fails its save against his smash.

Instead of smashing, titans can hurl boulders to a distance of 1200’, dealing 4d6 {B!} damage in a 5’ radius to the impact point. When hurling a boulder, a titan functions like a heavy ballista using the rules for Missile Attacks with Artillery (***ACKS II RR****,* p. XX). However, the titan does not need to reload, so it can throw a boulder each round if it has sufficient ammo.

There is a 20% chance each lesser titan will have Mage abilities at level 2d6.

###### Ecology

Though sometimes found in dungeons, lesser titans usually dwell in mountain citadels on high peaks or in sky-castles atop clouds. They protect their lairs with trained creatures of various types: in a mountain citadel, there will be 4d6 giant dire wolves; in a sky castle, there will be 4d6 giant raptors.

###### Spoils

A slain lesser titan can be harvested with Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the following component useful in magic research:

* pituitary gland (20 st, 1200gp, *battering ram, flying fortress, magic carpet, sling stone, sudden stair, wall of smoke,* armor +1, weapon +3)

Lesser titan mages have more valuable pituitary glands (35 st, 2100gp).

### Toad, Giant

These immense toads can grow to be as large as a wolf and weigh up to 250lb. They are frequently encountered in dark forests and swamps and dank, wet dungeons.

###### Combat

Giant toads possess an **aquatic mechanoreception** that enables them to “see” in water up to 120’ by sensing changes in water current and water pressure. Spells or effects that would ordinarily cause blindness do not affect the toad while it is using aquatic mechanoreception. However, creatures that are not in the water are invisible to them. Aquatic mechanoreception does not penetrate structures or terrain features.

Due to their ability to alter the color of their warty hides, giant toads are **naturally stealthy**. Characters giant toads suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls.

Giant toads use their long, sticky tongues to attack creatures up to 15' away. If a toad succeeds on a tongue attack against a small creature, it can immediately **yank** the creature adjacent to itself and make a bite attack against it. However, the giant toad cannot cleave with its bite on any round when it makes a tongue attack.

If a giant toad succeeds on a bite attack against a small creature with an unmodified throw of 20, it can **swallow** the creature (p. XX). The swallowed creature suffers 1d4 {A} damage at the start of its initiative each round until either the toad is killed or the creature dies. The toad can cleave after swallowing a creature.

###### Ecology

Giant toads do not care for their young and often feed on them when other food sources aren’t available. When encountered in their lair, there will be a spawning pool somewhere nearby with 1d6 x 100 giant 5”-long tadpoles. Giant tadpoles have AC 0, Spd 60’, 1 hp, ML -4, and do not fight. Juvenile giant toads are indistinguishable from normal toads and are not usually discovered by adventurers.

###### Spoils

Because of their propensity to swallow creatures whole, any encounter with giant toads might yield treasure. The treasure (if any) is always found inside the creature’s belly.

A slain giant toad can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following components useful in magic research:

* tongue (3/6 st, 35gp, circle of agony, telekinesis, tongues)
* warts (2/6 st, 15gp, *chameleon*)

The amphibian behemoths are as unpleasant as they are stupid, and are rarely trained.

### Tokay Gull

The famous transmogrifier Niv of Nicea (14 – 98 IY) created the first tokay gulls by crossbreeding tokay geckos with seagulls. The resultant creature resembles a 2’ long tokay gecko with a pair of seagull wings that span 5’. A full grown tokay gull weighs around 9 lbs. Despite its small size, the tokay gull is aggressive, territorial, noisy, and covetous of both food and shiny objects.

Niv’s aim was to fashion the ideal familiar, messenger, and guard animal, and to his credit, his tokay gulls served him in just that capacity throughout his long life. Unfortunately, after the mage’s passing, his stock of tokay gulls broke out of his menagerie into the wild and began reproducing rapidly. Today, tokay gulls are found throughout Aurëpos, where they are widely considered nuisances and pests.

Kobolds, however, have come to love tokay gulls, and actively breed them as guard animals trained to bark when intruders are nearby. The loud shriek of the gulls can be heard from a great distance, especially in quiet caves and dungeons prone to echoes, and the bites of a gaggle of tokay gulls can be enough to kill a man.

Tokay gulls count as animals for purposes of serving as familiars.

###### Combat

Tokay gulls, like their lacertine progenitors, are **natural climbers**. They can climb utterly unimpeded across vertical surfaces or move upside down across ceilings at their combat movement rate. They can attack with their bites and defend themselves normally, but cannot charge or run while climbing. (Note that this is not just Climbing proficiency.)

Immediately upon detecting unfamiliar creatures, tokay gulls begin to **bark**. Once a tokay gull starts barking, it continues to do so each round that it detects unfamiliar creatures and for another 1d3 rounds thereafter, or until it is killed.

A single tokay gull’s bark can be heard to a range of 320’ in ordinary environments (double the range in quiet environments, halve it in loud environments); for each additional tokay gull, the range of earshot is increased by 30’. If there are any stocked monsters within earshot, they will respond to the alarm at the Judge’s discretion.

In addition, if there are wandering monsters in the dungeon, the Judge will make an encounter throw every round that the tokay gulls scream. If the throw results in an encounter, the wandering monsters attracted by the gulls will arrive in 2d6 rounds.

###### Ecology

When a wilderness colony of tokay gulls is encountered, there is a 25% chance per gull that it will have hidden a clutch of 1d2 eggs under rocks, in crevices, or in tree hollows nearby. The eggs have 1 hp and weight 1/6 st. Tokay gull hatchlings are rarely found in nests, because the creatures immediately disperse into the wild after they emerge from their eggs.

### Treeherder

A treeherder is an intelligent plant that stands about 18’ tall and weighs almost two tons. It somewhat resembles a human being with barky skin but in lieu of hair it has the crown of a small tree, with leaves that are deep green in the spring and summer and yellow, orange, or red in the fall and winter. When it closes its legs, they fit together so closely as to resemble the trunk of a tree.

A motionless treeherder cannot be distinguished from a tree at a distance of 90’ or more. The type of tree can vary widely -- treeherders seem to have different “ethnicities” that resemble different species of trees that grow around Aurëpos.

Treeherders have the lifespans of great trees and consequently act with caution and prudence at all times. Shorter-lived races such as humans find them tediously slow even to speak with. Treeherders speak their own language and can also **speak with plants** (as the spell). Treeherders that live near humans or elves will usually speak Common or Elven.

Treeherders are sometimes sought out for advice, because they are among the most learned naturalists in the world. They have forgotten more about flora and fauna than human sages have yet learned.

###### Combat

Because of their **tree-like appearance**, creatures encountering treeherders in a forest or other wooded area suffer a -2 penalty to avoid surprise.

As a full-round action, a treeherders can **awaken** up to 2 ordinary trees within a range of 60’. These awakened trees have the physical characteristics of **galdrtrés**, except that they cannot produce enchanting whistles, soporific mists, or bee swarms. The trees remain awake until the treeherder is slain, the tree is destroyed, or the treeherder uses an action in lieu of moving to put them back to sleep. The treeherder can awaken new trees in future rounds, but can never have more than 2 trees awakened at once.

Treeherders have tough bark that makes them **immune** to mundane piercing damage and **resistant** to extraordinary piercing damage. However, they are **susceptible** to fire damage.They save against fire at a-2 penalty and suffer double damage dice.

###### Ecology

Treeherders are found in primordial old-growth forests, which they cultivate much as a human farmer cultivates his crops. They reproduce by dropping seeds from their leaves once each year. A tiny percentage of the seeds develop in the right conditions of soil, water, and magic to become treeherders. Most simply become saplings of whatever type of tree the treeherder resembles.

### Triton

Tritons, or mermen, have the bodies of muscular humans from the waist up and the tails of sea-fish from the waist down. The tritons that live in the Ammas Aurë have pale skin with a light grey undertone, blue or hazel eyes, and black, navy blue, or sea green hair. Occasionally a triton may have bright red hair. Tritons measure about 8’ long and weigh about 400 lbs.

Commoners who dwell in the interior of Aurëpos think tritons are merely legends or fairy tales, but those who fish and sail the seas know them to be real, though reclusive, creatures. From time to time, when tritons need something from the surface world, they will swim to a village shore or come alongside a ship and offer to trade the bounty of the sea bounty in exchange for whatever good or service they need.

Tritons have their own language. About 75% of tritons speak one additional langue, usually the human or demi-human tongue spoken at the nearest settlement to their village.

###### Combat

Tritons have a lateral line system through their fish tails that affords them **aquatic mechanoreception** to a range of 60’. Those fish tails also provide **natural scale armor** that grants a +3 bonus to AC. Only champions and chiefs wear additional protection.

However, like humans, tritons arm themselves with weapons to hunt and fight. 50% of triton warriors will be armed with harpoon (treat as spear) and short sword. The other 50% will be armed with trident (treat as pole arm) and dagger.

###### Ecology

Triton villages are found only in great lakes, seas, and oceans. Most of their villages are deep underwater, but occasionally some are close to the surface for ease of hunting or trade. Triton bands can range far from their undersea homes.

Each band of triton will be led by a champion with 4 AC, 2 HD, and a +1 damage bonus. A triton village will be led by a chief with AC 6, 4 HD, and a +2 damage bonus. There is a 70% chance the village will be protected by trained giant fish. Roll 1d4 to determine the type and number: 1, 2d6+1 giant catfish; 2, 5d6 giant piranha; 3, 3d6 giant rockfish; 4, 1d10 giant sturgeon.

Triton villages will have tritones (often called mermaids) and eggs equal to 100% and 200% of the number of males each. Tritones have AC 2, HD ½, and attack with 1 dagger at 12+ (1d4). Tritones defending their eggs do not have to make morale rolls; they always fight to the death.

###### Spoils

A slain triton can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 2 for the following components useful in magic research:

### Troglodyte

These subterranean monsters are scaly reptilian humanoids, about 6’6” tall and 150 lbs weight, with bony spines along the center of the top of their heads, backs, and backs of their arms. Mages who have dissected them claim they are magical crossbreeds of lizardmen and chameleons, perhaps created by the Thrassians. Whatever the case, troglodytes are malicious and warlike, and will attempt to slay virtually any creatures that cross their paths.

Troglodytes speak their own foul tongue, a debased form of Elvish. Leaders have a 10% chance per HD of knowing the language of another subterranean species.

###### Combat

Troglodytes have small glands distributed across their bodies that produce **stinking slimy coatings** on their scaly hides. Demi-humans and humans that start their initiative or move within 5’ of a troglodyte must make a Death saving throw with a -2 penalty. If the save fails, the victim becomes **queasy** from the horrid stenchuntil it leaves the vicinity of the troglodyte.

The troglodytes’ chameleon-like scales make them **naturally stealthy**, and creatures encountering troglodytes have a -2 penalty to surprise rolls. This penalty does not apply to creatures that have Acute Olfaction.

They are **formidable warriors** and receive a +1 damage bonus with weapons. When out hunting, troglodyte warriors all carry 3 barbed bone darts (treat as javelins). They gain a +3 bonus to attack when hurling these darts. They usually do not wear armor or carry melee weapons, preferring to bite and claw.

###### Ecology

Each troglodyte gang will be led by a champion with 5 AC, 3 HD, 16 hp, and a +2 damage bonus (+1 with its natural attacks). Each troglodyte warband will be led by a sub-chieftain with 6 AC, 4 HD, 20 hp, and a +2 damage bonus (+1 with its natural attacks). A troglodyte lair or warren will be led by a chieftain with 7 AC, 6 HD, 28 hp, and a +3 damage bonus (+2 with its natural attacks). As long as the chieftain is alive, the troglodytes will gain a +2 bonus to morale rolls. Leaders often carry stone battle axes or clubs as a sign of rank.

Troglodyte lairs and warrens will have females and eggs equal to 100% the number of males in the lair each. Female troglodytes fight as hobgoblins, but only to defend the eggs.

When troglodytes are encountered in their warren, certain additional creatures will be present. The chieftain will be accompanied by one additional sub-chieftain for every warband, and 2d4 additional champions. In addition, a warren has a 33% chance of a shaman being present, and a 25% chance of a witch doctor. A shaman is equivalent to a sub-chieftain statistically, but has Shaman abilities at level 1d4. A witch doctor is equivalent to a champion statistically, but has Mage abilities at level 1d2.

### Troll

Trolls were created by the alchemy of the ancient Zaharans, who crossbreed ogres with hydras to create an unkillable predator. Full-grown adult trolls stand 10’ - 11' tall and weigh about 850 lbs, but their gaunt frames hide their great strength. Their rubbery hides are either moss green, mottled green and gray, or putrid gray, while their hair is either greenish black or iron grey, and their eyes are a glowing amber or yellow.

They live to kill, however, and enjoy eating other intelligent humanoids. Trolls tend to lair in dungeons, caverns, ruins, and swamps.

###### Combat

Trolls normally attack with their claws and teeth, dealing 1d6 extraordinary slashing and 1d10 extraordinary piercing damage respectively. If a troll successfully attacks the same target with both claws in the same attack routine, it immediately **rends** the target for an additional 2d8 {Se!} damage. If the rend kills the target, the troll can cleave with its claw.

What makes trolls truly terrifying is their ability to regenerate. Trolls regain 3 hp at the start of their initiative each round. If a troll is reduced to 0 hp, it becomes incapacitated, but it will continue to regenerate and stand again to fight when it regenerates to 1 or more hp. If, due to a spell or permanent wound, a troll loses a body part, the parts will act on the troll’s initiative, squirming at 5’ per round back toward the torso to reattach. (If it loses its head, the torso will move to the head.) A troll can reattach a severed member, including its head in lieu of one of its claw attacks simply by holding it to the stump. However, trolls cannot regenerate acidic or fire damage and if reduced to 0 hp by such are slain. When confronted by creatures equipped with fire or acid, trolls’ morale drops to 0.

###### Ecology

Each troll gang will be led by a champion with 6 AC 6, 7+3 HD, and 51 hp. A troll lair or village will be led by a chieftain with 8 AC, 10+6 HD, 63 hp, and a +2 damage bonus. As long as the chieftain is alive, the trolls will gain a +2 bonus to morale rolls.

When trolls are encountered in a village, certain additional creatures will be present. There will be females and whelps equal to 100% the number of males in the village each. Female trolls fight as ogres, while whelps fight as orcs. The chieftain will be accompanied by a sub-chieftain and 1d4 bodyguards. These will have 7 AC, 8+3 HD, 45 hp, and a +2 damage bonus. In addition, a troll village has a 50% chance of a shaman being present, and a 25% chance of a witch doctor. A shaman is equivalent to a sub-chieftain statistically, but has the abilities of a shaman of level 1d4. A witch doctor is equivalent to a champion, but has the abilities of a mage of level 1d2.

### Turtle, Sea

These aquatic turtles can be up to 9’ long and weigh as much as to 2000 lbs. Their leathery shells are softer than those of hard-shelled land turtles, which allows for more flexibility in movement. They have beaked mouths with sharp, toothless jaws and long, powerful flippers that make them graceful swimmers and awkward crawlers. Unlike most turtles, they are unable to withdraw their head and limbs into their shells, and must instead rely on their fierce bites for defense.

###### Combat

Sea turtles have **acute olfaction.** They gain a +1 bonus to avoid surprise in their natural habitat.

Though sea turtles are agile in water, they are **ponderously slow** on land. If caught out of the water, their AC is reduced by 2 (from 4 to 2) and they suffer a -2 penalty to initiative rolls.

Sea turtles are **immune** to the stings of jellyfish, which are among their primary prey.

###### Ecology

Sea turtles are solitary creatures and rarely congregate. The males never venture onto land, while the females venture onto land only to lay eggs. After depositing their eggs in on the beach, the turtles return to the sea, leaving the hatchlings to fend for themselves once they emerge. Hatchlings make their way to the sea alone and begin their solitary lives in the ocean.

###### Spoils

A slain sea turtle with extraordinary characteristics can be harvested with Magical Engineering for the following component useful in magic research:

* beak (1 stone, 65gp, *arcane armor, divine armor, swimming*)

A sea turtle’s leathery shell fetches 110gp and weighs 40 st.

###### Lore

*During our voyages across the Ammas Aurë we saw a number of sea turtles of substantial size – but these weighed perhaps one ton. Legends of giant dragon-sized turtles large enough to carry a village on their shell must, I believe, be considered entirely unfounded.*

* Toraster the Elder, *Bestiary of Aurëpos*

### Unicorn

Unicorns were created by the Empyrean gods as icons of honor, nobility, and purity. A unicorn resembles a wild horse of medium size, with a long straight ivory horn projecting from its brow. Most unicorns have snow white coats, but some are palomino, blood bay, or even black. Their manes and tails can be white, gold, red, or black. Their bright, intelligent eyes are deep sea-blue, violet, brown, or fiery gold. Unicorn stallions often sport a short beard the same color as their mane.

They are sapient and can speak their own language as well as the beast-tongue of horses. There is a 25% chance a unicorn speaks Common and 50% chance it speaks Elvish.

###### Combat

A unicorn’s horn is magical and deals extraordinary damage. In addition, a unicorn can cast **cure light injury** thrice per day as a spell-like ability by touching a creature with its horn.

A unicorn can cast **arcane shift** once per day as a spell-like ability, thereby transporting itself and its rider (if any) up to 360' in any direction.

###### Ecology

Though unicorns once galloped across all the lands of Aurëpos, they have been hunted to the brink of extinction by poachers greedy for their magical horns. They are now found only in primordial forests of Northern and Southern Argollë and in the forest peaks of the great mountain ranges.

When a unicorn herd is encountered, there is a 50% chance they will be a matriarchal herd with 1d4-1 juvenile unicorns and 1d3-1 baby unicorns. (Otherwise, it’s a bachelor herd.) Juvenile unicorns have AC 5, Spd 180’, HD 2, and attack with 2 hooves (1d3 {B{). Baby unicorns have AC -1, Spd 180’, HD 1, and attack with 1 hoof (1 {B}). Neither have horns or the special abilities that the horns afford their parents.

###### Spoils

A slain unicorn can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the following components useful in magic research:

* horn (16 4/6 st, 1,000gp, *discern evil, cure injury, healing circle, purify food and water, spirit of healing*)
* hooves (5 5/6 st, 350gp, *arcane shift, safe travels*)

If not used for magic research, a unicorn's horn fetches 4d4x100gp. It weighs 1 stone for every 1,000gp value.

Unicorns can be trained only be monster whispering. They will only consent to be trained or ridden by Lawful elven women or human women with CHA 16+ or Elven Bloodline.

### Vampire

The vampire is a powerful undead creature that resembles an ordinary human, typically of noble form and countenance, albeit with very pale skin, slightly elongated canine teeth, and long sharp nails.

###### Combat

Predators by nature, vampires possess **acute hearing** and **acute olfaction** that grants them a +2 bonus to avoid surprise.

Vampires are notorious for their **hypnotic gaze.**  A vampire can use its combat action to hypnotize a humanoid creature within 60’ which is beholding the vampire. When targeted, the creature must make a Spells saving throw at -2. If the save succeeds, the creature is not affected. If the save fails, the creature is **enslaved** until either the vampire releases the creature from its control, the vampire is destroyed, or the effect is **dispelled** by *dispel magic* or *counterspell*. The vampire can release an enslaved creature from its control at any time without expending an action. A vampire can maintain control over no more than one enslaved creature per HD.

A vampire is **preternaturally strong**. It can attack with a weapon, dealing extraordinary damage with double the weapon’s ordinary damage dice, or it can claw with a long-nailed hand for 1d10 {S!} damage. If the vampire hits a creature with its claw, it automatically **grabs** the creature struck unless it succeeds on a Paralysis saving throw.

As a full-round action, a vampire can bite an **enslaved**, **grabbed** or **helpless** creature. The bite automatically hits, dealing 1d4 {N!} damage and draining 3 points of CON from the creature. Should a creature be drained to CON 2 or less by a vampire’s bite, it collapses into unconsciousness. If reduced to CON 0 or less, it immediately dies. Blood-drained creatures regain 1 point of CON per day of rest. The vampire can continue drinking its blood each round thereafter until the target stops being enslaved, grabbed, or helpless. A vampire’s bite does not awaken a sleeping target. A vampire must drain at least its HD in points of CON per month from victims, or it loses 1 HD (to a minimum of 1 HD). It can recover HD by feeding to excess (e.g. at least its HD in additional points of CON.)

A vampire can assume **gaseous form** or **skinchange** into either a dire wolf or a giant bat at will as a spell-like ability. When skinchanged, the vampire gains the AC, movement rate, attacks, and damage characteristics of its new form, but retains its own HD and hit points. A skinchanged vampire cannot use its other special abilities.

If threatened, it can **call the creatures of the night** once per day as a spell-like ability. 1d10 bat swarms or rat swarms will come to its aid if underground, or 3d6 wolves or 2d4 dire wolves if above ground. In either case, the creatures called will arrive in 2d6 rounds. The creatures called will have morale scores of +4 and be completely obedient to the vampire.

Despite – or perhaps because of – their terrible connection to the powers of darkness, vampires can be strongly affected by a lawful holy symbol, a mirror, and/or garlic. The effects are as follows:

* Any character with a WIS of 13 or more can use a holy symbol to turn a vampire as an action in lieu of attacking. The attempt should be resolved as if the character were a crusader four levels of experience below his own class level.
* Any character may use an action in lieu of attacking to present a mirror to the vampire. Being presented with a mirror forces a vampire to avert its gaze on its next initiative. A vampire that is averting its gaze cannot use its hypnotic gaze.
* A character carrying garlic will be avoided by the vampire. He will not be attacked if another suitable target is available. If a character carrying garlic is the only available target, the vampire can attack him, but suffers a -2 penalty to its attack throw. A vampire will not grab or bite a character carrying garlic. Note that the character must be carrying the garlic in his hand or wearing it as a necklace; garlic in a backpack or sack is of no help.

A vampire is **immune** to enchantment effects, necrotic damage, poisonous damage, and all mundane damage. In addition, it is **resistant** to cold and electrical damage. If it is damaged, a vampire can only regain hit points by **slumbering** in a coffin containing mementos from its prior life. After each hour of rest, the vampire will recover 1/8 of its maximum hp. A vampire will typically maintain several coffins in secret locations to which it can retreat in safety.

A vampire that is reduced to zero or less hit points is not killed, but is instead instantly forced into its gaseous form. Thereafter further damage has no effect on the vampire, but the vampire can take no action except to move towards one of its coffins. Once it returns to its coffin, the vampire will reform into a corporeal body and then awaken with full hit points after 8 hours. There are only a few means by which a vampire can be truly destroyed:

* If forced into *gaseous form* and thereafter unable to reach one of its coffins, a vampire will lose 1 HD per month, fading into oblivion when it loses its last HD.
* If exposed to direct sunlight, a vampire must make a Death saving throw on its initiative each round, turning to dust if the save fails.
* If staked through the heart and then decapitated, a vampire will be irrevocably slain.

In order to stake or decapitate a vampire, the vampire must be helpless and the attacker must be unengaged by any other enemies and engaged with the vampire.

Staking a vampire is an action in lieu of attacking that instantly **paralyzes** the vampire and prevents it from escaping with *gaseous form* or *skinchange*.

Decapitating a vampire is an action in lieu of attacking that instantly reduces the vampire to 0 hp. Only the combination of staking and decapitation kills a vampire.

A vampire that is staked without then being decapitated is simply paralyzed and can be freed by removing the stake. A vampire that is decapitated without first being staked just transforms into *gaseous form*.

Vampires can, of course, be rebuked as vampires. However, if the result of a rebuke against a vampire is a “D”, it is only reduced to 0 hp, not killed.

Vampires who were Zaharans or other creatures with the After the Flesh class power will possess the proficiencies and special abilities they had in life – usually crusaders, fighters, mages, priestesses, or ruinguards of 9th level or higher. Such vampires can make Spells saving throws to resist turning, with a successful save meaning the rebuke attempt fails.

A character slain by a vampire’s bite attack will return from death in three days as an undead creature. If the slain character had 9 HD or more, he will return as a vampire with the HD it possessed in life. If the slain character had less than 9 HD, he will return as a vampire thrall (see below).

In either case, the newborn undead will be **enslaved** to the vampire that created him, becoming free willed only if his master is killed or has too many thralls to control. Once a character becomes a vampire, he can thereafter advance in HD as a vampire, retaining any class powers as well if his class or race includes the After the Flesh power.

###### Ecology

When one or more vampire are encountered in a lair, each vampire will be accompanied by 1d3 vampire thralls of 1d4+4 HD each; 1d6 vampire thralls of 1d4 HD each; and 2d6 enslaved human, demi-human, or humanoid servants of 1d3 HD each.

The enslaved servants might be used as guards, daytime servants and emissaries, and/or food. The Treasure Type for vampire excludes the treasure from the thralls, which should be rolled separately (see below).

###### Spoils

A destroyed vampire can be harvested with Healing 2 for the following components useful in magic research:

* blood (12 2/6 st., 740gp, *death ward, necromantic potence, withering touch, torpor*)
* eyes (12 2/6 st., 740gp, *bewitch humanoid, call of the wolf, dominate humanoid, enslave humanoid*)
* fangs (12 2/6 st., 740gp, *inspire horror, necromantic invulnerability*)
* impaled heart (12 2/6 st., 740gp, *gaseous form, torpor*)
* unburnt skin (12 2/6 st., 740gp, *deflect ordinary weapons, energy invulnerability (cold, electric), skinchange*)

### Vampire Thrall

Any character of 8 HD or less slain by a vampire’s bite attack will return from death in three days as a vampire thrall. (Those with 9 HD or more return as vampires.) A thrall resembles an ordinary human with very pale skin and slightly elongated canine teeth. A vampire thrall is utterly **enslaved** to the will of the vampire that created him, becoming free willed only if his master is killed. A vampire thrall possesses some, but not all, of the characteristics and powers of a vampire. A thrall’s characteristics depend on its HD, as shown on the tables below. Vampire thralls of 3 HD or less deal mundane damage while those of 4 HD or more deal extraordinary damage.

### Varmint, Giant Ferret

These nasty-tempered creatures are much like their smaller kin but grow to a length of 4’ and weight of 135lbs.

###### Combat

Giant ferrets have **acute hearing** and **acute olfaction.** They gain a +2 bonus to avoid surprise in their natural habitat. They can track the scent of creatures for up to 2 miles with the equivalent of one rank of Tracking proficiency. They are **skilled climbers**, able to ascend sheer surfaces as if they were thieves (5+).

###### Ecology

When giant ferrets are encountered in their den, the ferrets will be rearing 4d4 juvenile ferrets and 2d4 baby ferrets. Juveniles have AC 2, Spd 120’, HD ½, and 1 bite (1d3 {P}). Babies have AC 1, Spd 120’, 1 hp, ML -4, and do not fight.

###### Spoils

A giant ferret corpse can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following component useful in magic research:

* snout (1/6 st, 15gp, *locate animal or plant*)

A giant ferret's pelt fetches 7gp and weighs 2/6 st.

Giant ferrets are sometimes used to hunt other giant vermin, but their temperamental personalities make them difficult to train.

###### Encounter

A field here is pocketed with holes 3' in diameter. Scattered near the holes are the bones and gristle of dogs and other small animals. Below the field lies a burrow, consisting of four 12’ square dens crisscrossed by horizontal tunnels, each 2’ to 5’ in diameter. The burrow is occupied by **11 giant ferrets**. The ferrets are rearing **9 juvenile ferrets** and **4 baby ferrets**.

**Giant ferrets (11):** Spd 150’, AC 4, HD 1+1, hp 6, #AT 1 (bite 9+), Dmg 1d8 {P}, Save F1, ML 0, AL N, XP 15

**Juvenile ferrets (9):** Spd 120’, AC 2, HD ½, hp 2, #AT 1 (bite 11+), Dmg 1d3 {P}, Save F0, ML 0, AL N, XP 5

**Baby ferrets (4):** Spd 120’, AC 1, hp 1, Save F0, ML -4, AL N, XP 0

### Varmint, Giant Rat

Giant rats are omnivorous rodents that thrive on human trash on the fringes of dwellings. The smallest are 3' long and 33 lbs., but rodents of unusually large size are not unknown. They are adept swimmers who are at home in sewers, water-filled caverns, and marshes.

###### Combat

Giant rats have **acute hearing** and gain a +1 bonus to avoid surprise in its natural habitat. They are **skilled climbers**, able to ascend sheer surfaces as if they were thieves (5+).

Giant rats **fear fire** and must make morale rolls each round any of the pack or horde is burned with torches or oil.

There is a 25% chance a pack or horde of giant rats is carrying a **deadly disease** which can infect creatures they bite. If so, the Judge will choose or roll for a disease on the Disease Type table (p. XX) and apply its effects to any creature damaged by the rats’ bites.

###### Ecology

When giant rats are encountered in a wilderness nest, the rats will be rearing 1d100 juvenile rats and 1d100 baby rats, collectively represented as a **rat swarm** with 1HD per 50 offspring (minimum 2 HD).

###### Spoils

A sl can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following component useful in magic research:

* tail (1/6 st., 5gp, *cause disease, cure disease, delay disease, plague*)

A giant rat's pelt fetches 1gp and weighs 1/6 st.

Giant rats are rarely trained, although from time to time a clever thief has found a use for them.

###### Encounter

A dark alley [canal if in river terrain], filled with trash [detritus if in river terrain], has become the den for a plague of **25 giant rats**. These rats have created a complex, maze-like nest from the heaps of filth and rotted crates and barrels strewn through the alley.

**Giant rats (25):** Spd 120’/60’ swim, AC 2, HD ½, hp 3 each, #AT 1 (bite 10+), Dmg 1d3 {P} + disease, Save F1, ML 0, AL N, XP 5; Special: disease carrier, fear fire

Among the filth can be found a set of thieves’ tools wrapped in oilskin (25gp), a pouch holding 2 lbs of comfrey (20gp, 2/6 st), a silver dagger (30gp), a scrimshaw drinking horn (40gp), and a cracked vase of Tirenean blown-glass (70gp, 1/6 st).

### Varmint, Giant Shrew

Giant shrews are insectivorous rodents that in some ways resemble giant rats with slightly longer snouts. They measure around 6’ long and weigh about 215 bs. They are skilled burrowers who often delve deeply into the soil.

###### Combat

Shrews are nearly blind but able to use **echolocation** (60’ range) by emitting small squeaks. No spells or effects that would ordinarily blind a creature will affect a shrew, but *inaudible* creatures are hidden from them, and *noiselessness* blinds them.

Giant shrews are highly territorial and automatically hostile to any creature which enters their territory. They have **lightning reflexes** and gain a +2 bonus on initiative. Giant shrews can attack with their bite twice each round.

###### Ecology

When giant shrews are encountered in in a wilderness nest, the shrews will be rearing 1d2 juvenile shrews and 1d2 baby shrews. Juveniles have AC 3, Spd 150’, HD ½, and attack with 2 bites (1d2 {P}). Babies have AC 2, Spd 150’, 1 hp, ML -4, and do not fight.

###### Spoils

A giant shrew corpse can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following component useful in magic research:

* paws (1/6 st., 10gp, *inaudibility, noiselessness, leaping, swift sword*)

A giant shrew's pelt fetches 8gp and weighs 4/6 st.

Being both blind and territorially hostile, giant shrews are rarely trained except by gnomes, with whom they share great affinity.

###### Encounter

Erupting from the forest floor is a giant bee hive, 16’ in diameter and 19’ tall, its honeycombed structure filled with numerous cells, each 2-8’ in diameter. The hive is ominously quiet, and no insect activity is apparent. In fact, the bees have been devoured by **five giant shrews** who have now taken up residence here. The shrews are rearing **one juvenile shrew** and **two baby shrews**.

**Giant shrews (5):** MV 180’, AC 5, HD 1, hp 8, 6, 5, 5, 2, #AT 2 (bites 10+), Dmg 1d6 {P} / 1d6 {P}, Save F1, ML +2, AL N, XP 10; Special: echolocation, lightning reflexes

### Varmint, Giant Weasel

These horse-sized hunters measure around 9' long and weigh around 2,000 lbs. They are skilled burrowers and live in the tunnels they create in the earth.

###### Combat

Giant weasels have **acute hearing** and **acute olfaction.** They gain a +2 bonus to avoid surprise in their natural habitat. They can track the scent of creatures for up to 2 miles with the equivalent of one rank of Tracking proficiency. They are also **skilled climbers**, able to ascend sheer surfaces as if they were thieves (5+).

If a giant weasel damages a target with its bite, it clamps onto it and begins **draining blood**.Once clamped on, the weasel can use its combat action to automatically deal 2d4 necrotic damage to the creature each round. Creatures that are having their blood drained by a giant weasel can still move but count as carrying an extra 40 st of encumbrance. The weasel moves with the creature from which it is drinking blood. It will continue cling until either the creature dies or the weasel has been killed.

###### Ecology

When giant weasels are encountered in a wilderness den, the weasels will be rearing 1d4 juvenile weasels and 1d4 baby weasels. Juveniles have AC 0, Spd 120’, HD 2+2 and attack with 1 bite (1d4 {P}). Babies have AC -1, Spd 120’, HD 1+2, and attack with 1 nasty nibble (1 {P}).

###### Spoils

A giant weasel corpse can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following components useful in magic research:

* teeth (2 st., 115gp, *cause light injury, life transfer*)
* whiskers (1 4/6 st., 100gp, *locate animal or plant*)

A giant weasel's pelt fetches 115gp and weighs 4/6gp.

Giant weasels are harder to train than giant ferrets, but their great size makes them more valuable as hunters. Kobolds, in particular, have great affinity for them.

###### Encounter

Below the scrub-land lies a complex burrow consisting of a grid of 3’-8’ diameter tunnels that intersect at feeding chambers, nests, toilets, and food storage chambers, each about 15’ to 20’ square. A total of seven exits lead from the burrow to the surface, visible from the surface as kick outs of excavated soil and freshly-cut shrubs. The burrows are home to a sneak of **three giant weasels** along with their offspring, **two juvenile weasels** and **one baby weasel**.

**Giant weasels (3):** Spd 150’, AC 2, HD 4+4, hp 28, 25, 19, #AT 1 (bite 6+), Dmg 2d4 {P} + blood drain, Save F3, ML 0, AL N, XP 215; Special: Special: blood drain

The weasels are man-eaters, and one of the food storage chambers contains the half-eaten remains of several humanoids. A pouch on one of the cadavers contains 1,000sp, a pair of topazes (500gp each) and a carnelian (75gp).

### Venous Sentinel

The necromantically-animated heart and veins of a humanoid, a venous sentinel is a terrible, alien thing, a pulsing heart set at the center of a mass of writhing, sharp-tipped arteries and veins. Sometimes created during the mummification process when the heart and arteries are removed intact, venous sentinels can be found set as guardians in Zaharan tombs, as well as secured in canopic jars, ready to attack when inadvertently released.

###### Combat

Venous Sentinels use their manifold blood vessels for **terrestrial mechanoreception**,enabling them to sense vibration in the ground over long distances equivalent to line of sight in full daylight.

These undead skitter forth obscenely on enlarged and animated veins, while using other veins to pierce foes and drain them of their vital fluids. If a venous sentinel damages a target with a vein, the vein latches onto the target and begins **draining blood**. Thereafter the vein can automatically deal another 1d4 {N!} damage to the target each round without having to make an attack throw. Doing so counts as the venous sentinel’s attack with that vein. Multiple veins can drain blood from the same target.

Creatures that have veins attached to them can still move but count as carrying 2 extra stone of encumbrance. The venous sentinel moves with the creature it is attached to. If it has veins attached to multiple creatures, it can remain attached to them all provided they stay within 10’ of each other; if the distance exceeds 10’ it must choose which creature(s) to stay attached to, and release the other(s).

Otherwise, a creature can only escape or be freed from a vein by killing the venous sentinel or severing the vein. An attached vein can be cut off by dealing 3 or more slashing damage to it in one blow. Any damage dealt beyond 3 points is not dealt to the venous sentinel (the vein was already severed). A venous sentinel loses one attack each time a vein is severed. Each vein must be severed separately.

Like all undead, venous sentinels are immune to enchantment effects and poisonous damage. They are rebuked as ghouls. A destroyed venous sentinel can be harvested with Healing 2 for their heart (4/6 st, 38gp, *cause light wounds, life transfer, swift strike*).

###### Ecology

As undead constructs, venous sentinels have no natural habitat. They are commonly found in catacombs, crypts, and tombs of Chthonic dead.

###### Spoils

A destroyed venous sentinel can be harvested with Healing 2 for the following component useful in magic research:

* heart (3/6 st., 29gp, *life transfer*)

### Wasp, Giant Parasitic

Sages theorize that giant parasitic wasps first arose when ordinary parasitic wasps accidentally injected demon-blooded attercop spiderlings with their eggs. Like their smaller cousins, the wasps lay eggs in the living bodies of hosts. The host’s bodies then incubate the eggs until they hatch into a larvae, which devour the hosts from within. Ordinary parasitic wasps use aphids, beetles, spiders, and other insects as hosts, but the monstrous giant breeds need creatures much larger… like men.

###### Combat

Giant parasitic wasps have **acute olfaction** and gain a +1 bonus to avoid surprise in their native habitat. Their aerial mechanoreception enables them to “see” to a range of 60’.

A giant parasitic wasp’s stinger deals 2d4 {P!} damage and injects a **paralytic venom**. Any living creature damaged by the stinger must make a successful Death saving throw or immediately become **paralyzed** indefinitely. Every 24 hours, the victim may attempt the Death save again to end the effect; otherwise, only the application of a healing potion or magical healing will put an end to the paralysis.

A wasp that has paralyzed or slain a creature does not cleave; instead it automatically **grabs** the creature. On its next initiative, the wasp can carry off the grabbed creature with its movement action and then inject it with an egg as its combat action. If the creature is alive but paralyzed, it can make a Death save to avoid being implanted with the egg. If the save succeeds, the egg doesn’t take. If the save fails, or the creature is dead, the egg is inserted deep into the host’s body. 2d4 days after eggs are injected, the egg will hatch into a larva. The larva will start chewing its way through the host’s vital organs, dealing 1d6 extraordinary necrotic damage per round. A *cure disease* spell can destroy the egg and/or the larva but otherwise, death is certain. When the host finally dies, the larva will emerge and form a cocoon. Most of the time, the larvae withers and dies in the cocoon, but about 1 in 300 will hatch into an adult giant parasitic wasp after 2d6+14 days.

Unless encountered in its nest, a wasp will not carry off paralyzed or dead victims until all opponents are defeated or it fails a morale roll and withdraws. Otherwise, it will release the victim after injecting him and then attempt to paralyze and parasitize more hosts.

###### Ecology

Giant parasitic wasps dwell in small nests made of chewed wood pulp and saliva. They lack the complex social structure of the eusocial giant ants and giant bees.

###### Spoils

A slain giant parasitic wasp can be harvested with Animal Husbandry 2 for the following components useful in magic research:

* stinger(5 st, 300gp, *halt humanoid, halt monster*)
* ovipositor (6 st, 360gp, *disfigure body and soul, fillet and serve*

If not used for magic research, a giant parasitic wasp’s stinger fetches 8gp and weighs 1/6 st. Its venom (onset time 1 turn, no saving throw modifier, **paralysis** for 1d6 turns) fetches 175gp and weighs 1/6 st.

### Whale, Killer

These immense whales typically reach a length of 25' and weight of 7,700 lbs. They somewhat resemble dolphin save for their unusual size and black-and-white coloration. They prefer the colder waters of the north or extreme south, preying on many different sea animals.

###### Combat

Killer whales use **aquatic mechanoreception** to “see” in water up to 600’. Spells or effects that would ordinarily cause blindness do not affect the whale while it is using aquatic mechanoreception. However, creatures that are not in the water are invisible to them. Aquatic mechanoreception does not penetrate structures or terrain features.

While not able to breathe water, killer whales can **hold their breath** for 2 turns (20 minutes). They are swift swimmers and **prodigious leapers**; a killer whale that charges on its initiative can jump up to 15’ vertically and horizontally out of the water at any point in its movement.

Killer whales can **swallow whole** creatures of man size or smaller on an unmodified attack throw of 20. The swallowed creature suffers 3d6 {A!} damage at the starts of its initiative each round and drowns after 10 rounds. If the swallowed creature has a tiny, small, or natural piercing or slashing weapon, it can attack the whale from inside its belly with an attack penalty of -4. Should a swallowed creature die and remain in the whale’s belly for 6 turns, it is irrecoverably digested. The whale can cleave after swallowing a creature.

###### Ecology

When a pod of killer whales is encountered, there is a 50% chance the adults will be accompanied by 1d3 juveniles and 1d2 babies. Juvenile killer whales are large size, have AC 1, Spd 210’, HD 4+2, and attack with 1 bite (2d8 {P}). Baby killer whales are man-sized, have AC 0, Spd 180’, HD 3, and attack with 1 bite (1d8 {P}). Babies and juveniles cannot swallow targets whole.

###### Spoils

Because of their propensity to swallow creatures whole, any encounter with wandering killer whales might yield treasure. The treasure (if any) is always found inside the whale’s belly.

A slain killer whale can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following component useful in magic research:

* air sacs (21 4/6 st., 1,300gp, *capsizing wave, circle of agony, swimming*, armor +1, weapon +2)

A killer whale’s dentition is worth 32gp and weigh 2/6 st.

###### Lore

*Mariners who sail beyond the Narrow Sea come, after a journey of several days, to the jungled coastline of West Ulruk. If they continue their journey past the Ivory Kingdoms, the jungles give way to steep mountains with peaks clad in ice and snow. The cold waters at the foot of these mountains are home to strange creatures unlike any found in the Ammas Aurë. Among these is a fierce whale, black and white in coloration, which the natives call an* orca*, that is, an “orc of the ocean.”*

* Toraster the Elder, *Bestiary of Aurëpos*

### Whale, Narwhal

These large whales typically reach a length of 15’ and weight of 3,500 lbs. The great horn of a narwhal resembles that of a unicorn, and is highly sought by whalers for its reputed magical properties. They tend to be found only in the less-hunted waters of the north or extreme south and are only rarely seen in the Ammas Aurë. They are highly intelligent and social creatures capable of complex communication.

###### Combat

Narwhals use **aquatic mechanoreception** to “see” in water up to 600’. Spells or effects that would ordinarily cause blindness do not affect the whale while it is using aquatic mechanoreception. However, creatures that are not in the water are invisible to them. Aquatic mechanoreception does not penetrate structures or terrain features.

While not able to breathe water, narwhals can **hold their breath** for 3 turns (30 minutes). They are not as agile as other whales and infrequently breach the water.

###### Ecology

When a pod of narwhals is encountered, there is a 33% chance the adults will be accompanied by 1d3 juveniles and 1d2 babies. Juvenile narwhals have AC 0, Spd 150’, HD 3, and attack with 1 bite (1d6 {P}). Baby narwhals have AC -1, Spd 150’, HD 2, and attack with 1 bite (1d2 {P}). They do not have horns.

###### Spoils

A slain narwhal can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following component useful in magic research:

* horn (53 2/6 st., 3,200gp, *discern curse, discern evil, discern poison, swimming*)

If not used for magic research, a narwhal's horn fetches 1d6x1,000gp and weighs 1 stone for every 1,000gp value.

###### Lore

*Upon seeing the beauty of the land, the sky, and the sea, the Seven set a challenge on themselves, whereby each vowed to create a majestic beast worthy of dwelling in the beauty of the world. Each went to their demesne and worked, and when they were done they came again together in Elysium. There Ammonar revealed the proud eagles, Istreus the wise owls, and Türas the great bulls; and Ianna revealed the fierce lions, Calefa the cunning ravens, Mityara the resplendent unicorns.*

*When it was the turn of Naurivus to show what he had made, he revealed the great whales, and waxed proud at their size and strength. But Mityara laughed when she saw his whales, and called them awkward and absurd.*

*Naurivus was wroth to be so shamed by his sister, but he did naught but wait until she grew drunk on nectar and ambrosia. Then he passed unseen to her demesne and stole the horns of all the unicorns he could find. Afterwards, he carried them to the sea and affixed them to the brows of his whales, crying “Witness the majesty of the unicorn of the sea!”*

*And so were made the great narwhals; while the unicorns who had lost their horns were humbled, and so became horses. And today the narwhal and the horse are both sacred to Naurivus, their maker; while the unicorn of Mityara is but rarely found.*

* Thalosides, *Mythos*

### Whale, Sperm

These gigantic whales typically reach a length of 60' and a weight of 120,000 lbs. Their huge, box-like heads can take up one-third of their length while their huge tail flukes can measure up to 15’ long. Like other whales, they are highly intelligent and social creatures capable of speaking a song-like language.

###### Combat

Sperm whales use **aquatic mechanoreception** to “see” in water up to 600’. Spells or effects that would ordinarily cause blindness do not affect the whale while it is using aquatic mechanoreception. However, creatures that are not in the water are invisible to them. Aquatic mechanoreception does not penetrate structures or terrain features.

While not able to breathe water, sperm whales can **hold their breath** for 9 turns (90 minutes). Despite their size, they are **prodigious leapers**; a sperm whale that charges on its initiative can jump up to 15’ vertically and horizontally out of the water at any point in its movement. When it lands in the water, it creates a huge splash. Creatures within 60’ of the splash suffer a -2 penalty to Swimming and Seafaring throws until the end of their next initiative.

If a sperm whale succeeds on a bite attack against a creature of huge size or less with an unmodified throw of 18 - 20, it can **swallow** the creature. The swallowed creature suffers 3d20 {A!} damage at the starts of its initiative each round and drowns after 10 rounds. If the swallowed creature has a tiny, small, or natural piercing or slashing weapon, it can attack the whale from inside its belly with an attack penalty of -4. Should a swallowed creature die and remain in the whale’s belly for 6 turns, it is irrecoverably digested. The whale can cleave after swallowing a creature.

When a sperm whale encounters a sea vessel, it usually leaves it undisturbed, but sometimes it will ram the vessel, dealing 6d6 {B!} structural damage.

###### Ecology

When a pod of sperm whales is encountered, there is a 25% chance the adults will be accompanied by 1d3 juveniles and 1d3 babies. Juvenile sperm whales are gigantic size, have AC 1, Spd 150’, HD 18, and attack with 1 bite (3d10 {P!}). Baby sperm whales are huge size, have AC 0, Spd 150’, HD 12, and attack with 1 bite (3d4 {P!}). Both can swallow targets whole.

###### Spoils

Because of their propensity to swallow creatures whole, an encounter with wandering sperm whales might yield treasure. The treasure (if any) is always found inside the whale’s belly.

A slain sperm whale can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following components useful in magic research:

* air sacs (110 st, 6,500gp, *battering ram, capsizing wave, circle of agony, swimming,* armor +1).
* spermaceti (100 st, 6,000gp, *illumination, kindle flame, slickness, water walking*)

A sperm whale’s dentition fetches 60gp and weigh 1 st.

###### Lore

*The head-wax of the great whale possesses an incendiary virtue that catalyzes alchemic concoctions of light and fire. This same virtue would certainly make the head-wax a valuable fuel for the industrial automatons of the dwarven machinists. Be glad they do not take to sea! The harpoons of the dwarves would likely empty the waters of whales, just as the axes of the dwarves have emptied the mountains of our trees.*

* Caoláin, *The Illuminated Primer of Alchemy*

### Wight

The chthonic cults hold that a mortal who dies is doomed to oblivion unless he magically binds his soul to his preserved corpse. But what happens if a devoted servant of the dark gods dies in a manner that destroys his corpse beyond mortuary repair? In such cases, the soul of the deceased cultist can be bound into *another* person’s preserved corpse. Such a creation is known as a wight.

A wights has the mind and memories of the evil soul that animates it, but also gains access to the residual memories of the corpse it inhabits (the same memories accessed by *speak with dead*). With this foul knowledge, it delights in tormenting those who knew the deceased in life. During the Empyrean War, the necromancer-priests of Zahar would often purposefully bind a malevolent and hateful soul into the body of a slain Empyrean hero in order to demoralize their foes. The moral impact on the rebels of seeing a favored champion return as a wight to fight for the enemy was devasting.

Wights appear as embalmed corpses decked in the funerary garments and shrouds they were buried in. Most wear helms or cuirasses buried on their corpse and might carry ancient axes, blades, or spears, tainted and poisoned with the wight’s bile.

###### Combat

If unarmed, a wight attacks with a **necrotizing** **touch** that deals 1d6 {N!} damage. If armed, it deals extraordinary damage by weapon +1, causing {N!} damage in addition to the weapon’s normal damage type. Any living creature damaged by a wight’s attack must make a successful Death saving throw or start **rotting**. Rotting creatures gradually begin to bruise, bleed from their orifices, and slough off hair and skin. They take 1 {N!} damage at dusk each day and cannot benefit from magical healing until the condition ends. Wight rot can be cured with *cure disease* or temporarily halted with *delay disease*.

Wights are **immune** to enchantment effects, necrotic damage, poisonous damage, and all mundane damage. However, silver weapons deal extraordinary damage against wights. Wights are inherently evil for purposes of *discern evil*and *holy circle*spells and are rebuked as wights.

###### Ecology

Since the fall of Zahar, few wights have been deliberately created, though some can still be found in the ancient tombs and temples that dot the Waste. As the Awakening approaches, however, it is possible that buried corpses across Aurëpos might be animated as wights by the evil spirits conjured by that fell occasion.

###### Spoils

A destroyed wight can be harvested with Alchemy 2 for the following component useful in magic research:

### Wild Huntsman

At the height of the Argollëan Empire, elven hunter-cultists devoted to the chthonic god Nargund formed hunting parties that sought mighty game throughout the Meniri Mountains. The terrified humans who witnessed these festivals of slaughter dubbed them “Wild Hunts,” a name which passed into legend and folklore.

The predations of the Wild Hunt were vast, but not capricious. Every beast the Wild Hunt slew was actually sacrifice to their dark god intended to immortalize their souls. In that, they succeeded: Two thousand years later, the Wild Hunt continues to ride, its members having transcended death to become incorporeal undead known as wild hunters.

Wild huntsmen appear as incorporeal cataphracts mounted on steeds of tenebrous mist that soar through the heavens in pursuit of prey. They manifest in our sphere only when the eight-starred constellation of the Wolf is visible, and always number exactly eight. They will not attack those taking sanctuary on holy ground, nor will they assail the havens of their former race, but all others they encounter are considered fair game.

###### Combat

Any creature struck by a wild huntsman’s arrow or lance must make a Paralysis saving throw. If the save succeeds, the creature suffers damage from the attack but no other ill effect. If the save fails the creature suffers damage and is **faltering** until the end of its next initiative. However:

* If already faltering, the creature instead suffers an additional die of damage and is **frightened** until the end of its next initiative.
* If already frightened, the creature instead suffers two additional dice of damage.

If a creature is reduced to 0 hp by the attack of a wild huntsman it is slain and cannot be restored to life save by ritual magic*.* One day after the creature dies, it manifests as a **haunt** somewhere within 300’ of where it died (see p. XX).

A wild huntsman usually prefers to fight from the air, launching spectral arrows from its composite bow out to a range of 360’ with no range penalties. The wild huntsmen are **precise shots** (as the proficiency) and delight in showing off their archery prowess.

Confronted with a formidable foe, however, a wild huntsman might charge with its spectral lance. Being incorporeal, the lance does not cause impact damage. However, it is **terrifying**.When the wild huntsman completes its charge, any creatures within 10’ must make a Paralysis saving throw. If the save fails, the creature becomes **frightened**. If the save succeeds, the effect depends on the creature’s Hit Dice. If the creature has less than 1 HD, it still becomes frightened. If it has 1 HD or more, but less than 3 HD, the creature starts faltering. If it has 3 HD or more, the creature is unaffected by terror. The condition lasts until the end of the creature’s next initiative.

The steeds of the Wild Hunt have no independent existence and cannot be targeted or affected by spells. Any attacks aimed against the steeds count as attacks against the wild huntsman mounted on it.

Wild huntsmen are **immune** to enchantment effects, necrotic damage, poisonous damage, and all mundane damage. As **incorporeal** beings, natural and non-magical weapons always deal mundane damage against them, even if the creature would otherwise deal extraordinary damage. They are inherently evil for purposes of *discern evil*and *holy circle*spells and are rebuked as specters.

When a wild huntsman is reduced to 0 hp, it dissipates, but it is not permanently destroyed. A dissipated wild huntsman recovers on the next night of the wild hunt at full hit points. The members of the Wild Hunt can only be permanently destroyed if all eight are slain in the same night before consummating their hunt.

###### Ecology

Any time it manifests, the Wild Hunt will always contains 7 wild huntsmen led by a lord with 9 Hit Dice. The lord of the Wild Hunt can cast *summon weather*once per day. If the Wild Hunt is called to ride by day, the lord will use this ability to guarantee that a dark mist or fog falls over the land.

The Wild Hunt has no lair; anytime it is encountered, it will be on the move. It feeds on the life-energy released when the hunters turn living creatures into haunts. The wild huntsmen collectively share this energy, which is both their strength and weakness. If the Wild Hunt as a whole fails to create at least 50 HD worth of haunts each time it manifests, the entire Wild Hunt is destroyed.

Wild hunters are repelled by the light of Ammonar. They suffer a -2 penalty to attack throws, proficiency throws, and morale rolls in clear daylight. In addition, none of the members of the Wild Hunt can enter pinnacles of good or move within 3 miles of an elven fastness.

###### Spoils

A destroyed wild hunter can be harvested with Alchemy 2 for the following component useful in magic research:

* ectoplasm (17 5/6 st – 41 4/6 st, 1,070gp – 2,500gp, *deflect ordinary weapons, locate haunting, phantasmal horror, spectral legion, spiritwalk*)

### Wolf, Common

Wolves are pack hunters that can be found thriving anywhere from the slopes of the Meniri Mountains to the taiga beyond the Jutting Mountains. Common wolves are 6’ long and 3’ tall at the shoulder and weigh about 175 lbs.

###### Combat

Common wolves have **acute hearing** and **acute olfaction.** They gain a +2 bonus to avoid surprise in their natural habitat. They can track the scent of creatures for up to 4 miles with the equivalent of two ranks of Tracking proficiency.

As pack hunters, common wolves are more confident when they have greater numbers. If encountered in or reduced to a pack of 4 or fewer, their morale score is reduced by 1.

###### Ecology

Each pack or route of common wolves will be led by chief (who fights as a dire wolf).

When common wolves are encountered in their den, the adults will be rearing 1d6 puppies. Roll 1d6 for age; 1-4, they’re juveniles wolves, 5-6 they’re babies. Juvenile wolves have AC 0, Spd 150’, HD 1+1, and attack with 1 bite (1d2 {P}). Baby wolves have AC -1, Spd 150’, HD ½, and attack with 1 nibble (1 {P}).

###### Spoils

A slain wolf with exceptional attributes can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following component useful in magic research:

* teeth (3/6 st, 35gp, *call of the wolf, call of the wolf pack, skinchange*)

A wolf’s pelt fetches 15gp and weighs 3/6 st.

Wolves can be readily tamed and trained, especially if captured when young. They can learn to be both guards and hunters.

###### Encounter

Dug in the soft soil near a riverbank hollow is a small, 2’ wide hole surrounded by a large pile of dirt. A series of animal trails radiate from the hole; characters with Tracking proficiency can identify them as wolf tracks. The hole leads to a tunnel 15’ long, terminating in a wolf’s den about 4’ square, littered with small bones. Inside, **one wolf** (hp 12) is nuzzling **three wolf cubs**. The rest of the pack, another **ten wolves**, prowls the vicinity, and will rush back to protect the den in 1d6 rounds.

**Wolves (11):** MV 180’, AC 2, HD 2+2, hp 16, 15, 13, 12, 12, 12, 11, 10, 10, 9, 6, #AT 1 (bite 8+), Dmg 1d6 {P}, Save F1, ML 0, AL N, XP 35; Special: pack fighter (-1 morale if pack reduced to 50%)

**Wolf cubs (3):** MV 150’, AC 0, HD 1+1, hp 5, #AT 1 (bite 9+), Dmg 1d2 {P}, Save NM, ML 0, AL N, XP 15

### Wolf, Dire

Dire wolves are large wolves bred from wargs and trained as war mounts by beastmen. They are 8’ long and 4’9” tall at the shoulder and weigh about 585 lbs.

###### Combat

Dire wolves have **acute hearing** and **acute olfaction.** They gain a +2 bonus to avoid surprise in their natural habitat. They can track the scent of creatures for up to 4 miles with the equivalent of two ranks of Tracking proficiency.

As pack hunters, dire wolves are more confident when they have greater numbers. If encountered in or reduced to a pack of 4 or fewer, their morale score is reduced by 1.

###### Ecology

Each pack or route of dire wolves will be led by a chief, who fights as a warg. (The chief does not have the sapience of a warg, however.)

When dire wolves are encountered in their den, the adults will be rearing 1d3 puppies. Roll 1d6 for age; 1-4, they’re juveniles, 5-6 they’re babies. Juveniles have AC 1, Spd 150’, HD 2, and attack with 1 bite (1d4 {P}). Babies have AC 0, Spd 150’, HD 1+2, and attack with 1 nibble (1 {P}).

###### Spoils

A slain dire wolf can be harvested with Animal Husbandry, Labor (Butchery) or Trapping for the following component useful in magic research:

* teeth (2 2/6 st, 140gp, *call of the wolf, call of the wolf pack, skinchange*)

A dire wolf’s pelt fetches 50gp and weighs 1 4/6 st.

Because of their size and ferocity, dire wolves are rather more difficult to train than common wolves.

###### Encounter

An 8’ wide, 8’ high cleft between two great limestone boulders serves as the den of this pack of **five dire wolves** and **three baby dire wolf cubs**. One of the dire wolves is nursing the cubs, while the other four are relaxing nearby after a recent meal.

**Dire wolves (5):** Spd 180’, AC 3, HD 4+1, hp 22, 21, 20, 18, 16, #AT 1 (bite 6+), Dmg 2d4 {P}, Save F3, ML 0, AL N, XP 140

### Wolf, Warg

Wargs are huge demon-blooded wolves descended from barghests. They are 10’ long and 6’ tall at the shoulder and weigh as much as 1,050 lbs.

Evil and intelligent, they can speak their own language as well as the language(s) of any local beastmen. Wargs often fight alongside beastmen, but do not permit themselves to be ridden by anything less than a great chief or warlord.

###### Combat

Wargs have **acute hearing** and **acute olfaction.** They gain a +2 bonus to avoid surprise in their natural habitat. They can track the scent of creatures for up to 4 miles with the equivalent of two ranks of Tracking proficiency.

Like the wolves they were bred from, wargs are more confident when they have greater numbers. If encountered in or reduced to a pack of 4 or fewer, their morale score is reduced by 1.

###### Ecology

Each warg pack or route will be led by a chief, who fights as a lesser barghest.

When wargs are encountered in their den, the adults will be rearing 1d3 puppies. Roll 1d6 for age; 1-4, they’re juveniles, 5-6 they’re babies. Juveniles have AC 2, Spd 150’, HD 3, and attack with 1 bite (1d6 {P}). Babies have AC 1, Spd 150’, HD 2, and attack with 1 bite (1d2 {P}).

###### Spoils

A slain warg can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the following components useful in magic research:

* ears (1 st, 60gp, inaudibility, noiselessness)
* fangs (1 1/6 st, 75gp, *bloody flux*)

A warg’s pelt fetches 80gp and weighs 2 4/6 st.

###### Encounter

The ground here is blanketed with a thick layer of bark, leaves, twigs, and other duff. Jutting from the duff are a number of large boulders, covered in patches of lichen and moss, that form a rough enclosure. The gaps between the boulders on the ground are filled with nettles, thistles, and thorny bushes, except for a single 10’ opening. The boulders are crudely roofed on top with interlocking roots, shrubs, and soil. The interior of the enclosure is covered with soft ferns, animal hides, and leaves, creating a comfortable bedding for the **warg chief**, **four wargs**, and **two juvenile warg cubs** that lair here.

**Warg chief**: Spd 180’, AC 5, HD 8+2, hp 43, #AT 1 (bite 2+), Dmg 3d6 {P!}, Save F8, ML +3, XP 1,100; Special: bone-breaking bite

**Wargs (4)**: Spd 180’, AC 4, HD 6, hp 32, 28, 26, 20, #AT 1 (bite 5+), Dmg 3d4 {P}, Save F6, ML +3, XP 320

### Worm, Giant (Overview)

Giant worms are monstrous annelids that dwell in the dank depths of the earth. A giant worm’s invertebrate body is divided into hundreds of chitin-armored segments coated with thick acidic mucus within which bristle millions of ceaselessly-moving cilia. The worm’s head is almost entirely taken up by its hideous maw, from which spring forth three pairs of concentric mandibles that seize prey and instantly retract with the unfortunate victim back into the worm’s gut. Encircling the mouth is a ring of long mucus-coated antennas that squirm and wiggle towards prey.

###### Combat

Since eyesight is of little use in the dark, giant worms navigate and hunt by sensing vibration and tremors in earth with long antenna on their heads and millions of bristling cilia distributed across their segmented bodies.

The worms’ **terrestrial mechanoreception** is so acute that even a repeating pattern of footfalls can attract them from miles away. No spells or effects that would ordinarily blind a creature will affect a giant worm, but opponents that are flying, levitating, or otherwise not touching the ground are considered hidden to them.

###### Ecology

Giant worms are rarely seen on the surface, but sometimes they slither near enough to penetrate into human and demi-human excavations such as dungeons and dwarven vaults. The dwarfs claim that giant worms are but one of myriad nameless things that crawl the underdeep, but most Auran sages dismiss these assertions as tall tales intended to keep humans out of the dwarves’ deep roads.

###### Spoils

Because of their propensity to swallow creatures whole, any encounter with giant worms might yield treasure, whether they are wandering or in their nests. The treasure (if any) is always found inside the worm’s gizzard.

### Worm, Giant Black

Black worms are the largest of the giant worms. These colossal vermin can grow to 100’ in length, 10’ in diameter, and 16,000lbs in weight. The cuticles of their segments are pigmented dark purple or midnight blue.

###### Combat

The diameter of the black worm’s maw is more than three times the size of a white worm’s. If a black worm succeeds on a bite attack against a creature of huge size or less with an unmodified throw of 18 - 20, it can **swallow** the creature. The swallowed creature suffers 3d10 {A!} damage at the start of its initiative each round. If the swallowed creature has a tiny, small, or natural piercing or slashing weapon it can attack the worm from inside its belly with an attack penalty of -4. Should the swallowed creature die and remain in the worm’s belly for 6 turns, it is irrecoverably digested. The worm can cleave after swallowing a creature.

Perhaps more terrifying than the black worm’s bite is its poison. The pygidium (tail) of the black worm carries a mass of finger-like cirri (fused cilia) that are coated with **deadly poison**. Any creature damaged by the cirri must make a Death saving throw. If save fails, the creature dies at the end of the worm’s initiative.

A black worm can not only can burrow through loose earth, soil, and sand, but can smash through hard stone, dealing 20 {B!} structural damage per bite. A 30’ long 10’ diameter cylinder of stone has 200 shp, so it takes a black worm about 1 turn (10 rounds) to advance 30’ through stone.

###### Ecology

When a wilderness nest of giant black worms is encountered, there is a 25% chance per worm that it will have recently buried 1d6 eggs nearby. The eggs have 3 hp and weigh 12 st. Worm spawn disperse after birth and are not found in the den.

###### Spoils

A slain black worm can be harvested with Animal Husbandry 2 for the following components useful in magic research:

* cirri (25 st, 1,500gp, *poison,* weapon +1)
* gizzard (5 st, 300gp, *circle of agony, locate object, locate treasure*)
* mandibles (40 st, 2,400gp, *create chasm, earth's teeth, earth’s movement, passageway*)

If not used for magic research, a black worm’s mandibles fetch 36gp and weigh 4/6 st while its cirri fetch 12gp and weigh 1/6 st. Its venom (onset time instant, no saving throw modifier, death on failed Death saving throw) fetches 1,500gp and weighs 1/6 st.

### Worm, Giant Grey

Giant grey worms are huge annelids, though not so large as black worms. They can grow to 30’ in length, 4’ in diameter, and 2,700lbs in weight. Their segmented bodies range in color from bone white to dark grey.

###### Combat

If a grey worm succeeds on a bite attack against a creature of man size or less with an unmodified throw of 20, it can **swallow** the creature. The swallowed creature suffers 2d6 {A!} damage at the start of its initiative each round. If the swallowed creature has a tiny, small, or natural piercing or slashing weapon, it can attack the worm from inside its belly with an attack penalty of -4. Should the swallowed creature die and remain in the worm’s belly for 6 turns, it is irrecoverably digested. The worm can cleave after swallowing a creature.

In addition to burrowing through loose earth, soil, and sand, a grey worm can burrow through hard stone by dealing structural damage with its bite. The worm can deal 1 {B} structural damage per bite. A 30’ long 3’ diameter cylinder of stone has 20 shp, so it takes a white worm about 20 rounds (2 turns) to advance 30’ through stone.

###### Ecology

When a wilderness nest of giant grey worms is encountered, there is a 30% chance per worm that it will have recently buried 1d6 eggs nearby. The eggs have 1 hp and weigh 3/6 st. Worm spawn disperse after birth and are not found in the den.

###### Spoils

Because of their propensity to swallow creatures whole, an encounter with grey worms can yield treasure even though the creature has no lair. The treasure (if any) is always found inside the creatures’ bellies.

A slain grey worm can be harvested with Animal Husbandry 2 for the following components useful in magic research:

* gizzard (4 3/6 st, 270gp, *circle of agony, locate treasure*)
* mandibles (5 st, 300gp, *create chasm, earth's teeth, earth’s movement, passageway*)

If not used for magic research, a grey worm’s mandibles fetch 18gp and weigh 2/6 st.

###### Encounter

The ground ahead has collapsed. The fallen rubble forms an easily-traversable slope down into a braided maze of lava-tube passages running just below the surface. The black passages are about 7’ in diameter, with ceilings decorated by dripping stalactites that look like the polyps of an underwater creature. Here and there, the polyps have been broken off by the passage of some underground traveler. The lava tubes are the nest of **two giant grey worms.**

### Worm, Great Ice

The great ice worm is a horrific myriapod found in the high slopes of the Jutting Mountains. A typical specimen measures 25’ long, with a pale blue chitinous exoskeleton adorned by a pair of vestigial wings and twelve pairs of segmented legs ending in tarsal claws. Auran sages believe the worms might be among the most primitive creatures still extant in Aurëpos. Whereas higher forms of life such as mammals generate heat, great ice worms are so primeval as to actually generate cold…

###### Combat

Great ice worms are **naturally stealthy** when lurking in ice or snow, and creatures encountering them there suffer a -2 penalty to avoid surprise.

An **aura of intense cold** surrounds a great ice worm in a 10’ radius. Any creature that begins its initiative in, or moves into, the aura suffers 1d8 extraordinary cold damage and must make a Blast saving throw. If the save fails, the creature becomes **hypothermic**. If already hypothermic, it loses 1 CON. If a creature in the aura attacks the great ice worm with a melee weapon and rolls an unmodified attack throw of 1, the weapon instantly becomes freezing cold and might shatter. A non-magical weapon automatically shatters. A magic weapon shatters unless it succeeds on a Death save (use the wearer’s target value, adding any magic bonus if applicable).

If a great ice worm succeeds on a bite attack against a creature of large size or less with an unmodified attack throw of 19-20, it can **swallow** the creature (p. XX). The swallowed creature suffers 2d6 {A!} damage at the start of its initiative each round and the effects of the aura. The worm can cleave after.

###### Ecology

When a nest of great ice worms is encountered, there is a 20% chance that each worm will have recently buried 1d8 eggs nearby. The eggs have 2 hp and weigh 5 3/6 st. Worm spawn disperse after birth and are not found in the den.

###### Spoils

Because of their propensity to swallow creatures whole, an encounter with ice worms can yield treasure even outside the creature’s lair. The treasure (if any) is always found inside the creatures’ bellies.

A slain ice worm can be harvested with Animal Husbandry 2 for the following components useful in magic research:

* scales (13 3/6 st., 810gp, *shatter blade,* armor +3)
* stomach (12 st., 720gp, *create chasm, circle of agony, locate treasure*)
* tarsal claws (12 st., 720gp, *disintegrate, cone of frost, disintegration, protection from temperature, wall of frost*)

A great ice worm’s two horns each fetch 2d12x25gp and weigh 1 st per 80gp value. Its armored hide fetches 1,500gp and weighs 25st. Its mandibles each fetch 32gp and weigh 3/6 st.

### Wraith

Wraiths are undead creatures created by necromantically binding a disembodied soul to a set of apparel or armor, thereby granting it a physicality it would otherwise lack. From a distance, wraiths can be mistaken for pilgrims or other travelers clad in heavy cloaks, mantles, boots, and gloves. But close up, the horrifying truth becomes clear: There is nothing – no body, no bones, no flesh – within the clothing, just a shadowy void punctuated at eye level by pinpricks of flame.

###### Combat

Because of the magic that binds them to their garb, wraiths are semi-corporeal creatures that can speak, use equipment, ride mounts, and otherwise act in the world. If clad in mundane apparel or armor (of any type), a wraith has an AC of 6, but if clad in magical apparel or armor, it has an AC of 6 plus the magic bonus. It can further buttress its AC by using a shield.

If unarmed, a wraith attacks with an **enervating touch** that deals 1d8 {N!} damage. If armed, it deals damage by weapon +2, and the weapon cause {N!} damage in addition to its normal damage type. When a wraith damages a living creature, it permanently reduces the target’s maximum hp by an amount equal to the damage dealt. If the creature’s hp are reduced to 0, the creature is slain. If not slain, the creature becomes **enervated**.

An enervated creature must make a Death saving throw each day when it wakes from resting. If the save fails, the creature permanently reduces its maximum hp by another point. If the save succeeds, the creature does not reduce its maximum hp further that day. If a creature’s hp are reduced to 0 by the enervating touch, the creature is slain. if the save succeeds three times in a row, the condition ends. If a creature is slain by the enervating touch or enervated condition, it cannot be restored to life save by ritual magic*.* One day after the creature dies, it manifests as a **haunt** somewhere within 300’ of where it died (see p. XX).

If a wraith is reduced to 0 hp, the magic that grants it semi-corporeality is undone. All of its apparel and equipment drop to the ground, and the wraith’s spirit departs forever.

Wraiths are **immune** to enchantment effects, necrotic damage, poisonous damage, and all mundane damage except fire. However, silver weapons deal extraordinary damage against wraiths. Wraiths are inherently evil for purposes of *discern evil*and *holy circle*spells and are, of course, rebuked as wraiths.

###### Ecology

Wraiths are usually created as servants of some dark lord or necromancer-king and are thus often encountered on quests for their foul master. They can also be found in chaotic temples, places of death, and other sinkholes of evil.

A wraith sustains itself on the life-energy released when a living creature becomes a haunt. If it does not create at least one haunt per month, it loses 1 HD. It can replenish lost HD by creating additional haunts. If ever reduced to 1 HD, the wraith permanently becomes a haunt itself. A wraith that resides in a sinkhole of evil can sustain itself from the ambient energies of the sinkhole and does not have to feed.

### Wyvern

The first wyverns were created by the Thrassians, who bred wyvern-form dragons with giant scorpions to create a bestial flying monster with a pair of a talons and a poisonous stinger in its tail. An average wyvern’s body measures 15' long and weighs about 1,500 lbs, while its wing span stretches 45’. Their scales range from dark brown to gray, though jet black and ivory wyverns are occasionally seen.

Wyverns are most common in the cliffs of the Dark Wall and the Waste were they were created, though over time they have proliferated through the entire Meniri and Jutting Mountain ranges.

Due to the verminous blood introduced in their breeding, wyverns lack the sapiency of dragons, though they are so clever as to count as semi-sapient. They are nevertheless difficult to train due to their foul disposition and vicious temper.

###### Combat

When fighting on land, a wyvern can attack with its bite and **poisoned stinger**. A creature damaged by the stinger must make a successful Death saving throw or die at the end of the wyvern’s initiative.

When fighting from air, a wyvern can attack with bite and tail, or it can make a **dive attack** with its talons. A dive attack inflicts double the normal damage (4d8 {S!} / 4d8 {S!}). If the wyvern hits a creature smaller than itself with both its talons, the creature must make a size-adjusted Paralysis saving throw. If the save fails, the creature is **grabbed**.

###### Ecology

When wyverns are encountered in their aerie, there is a 25% chance each wyvern will be guarding offspring. Roll 1d4 for number and age: 1-2, it’s 1d6 eggs, 3-4 it’s 1d3 juveniles. Juvenile wyverns have AC 4, Spd 60’, HD 3+2, and attack with bite (1d8 {P}) and stinger (1d8 {P}). Juvenile wyverns cannot fly nor do their stingers carry venom. Wyverns will fight to the death to defend their offspring without checking morale.

###### Spoils

A slain wyvern can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the following components useful in magic research:

* eyes (2 st, 120gp, *locate distant object*)
* stinger (6 st, 360gp, *neutralize poison, poison*)
* talons (6 st, 360gp, *sharpness, striking,* weapon +2)
* wingtips (5 st, 300gp, *flight, winged flight*)

If not used for magic research, a wyvern’s stinger fetches 16gp and weighs 2/6 st and its two talons each fetch 16gp and weigh 2/6 st. A wyvern’s two horns each fetch 1d4x8gp and weigh 1 st per 80gp.

Its venom (onset time 1 round, +1 saving modifier, 7d6 {Po} damage on failed Death saving throw) fetches 600gp and weighs 1/6 st.

### Yali

Primarily found in Somirea, these awe-inspiring creatures resemble huge majestic lions, 6’ at the shoulder, with short elephant-like tusks enhancing an already terrible bite.

Unlike lions, yali are semi-sapient, with an intelligence similar to that of a gorilla or parrot. They often serve as sentinels and guard-beasts capable of defending temples of Lawful gods from wicked interlopers. They are famed for their devoted loyalty to their masters and steadfast resolve to confront evil, and can only be trained and handled by Lawful creatures.

###### Combat

Yali have the natural ability to **discern evil** (as the spell) at all times. They are instinctively aggressive towards beings sensed as evil, and attack them immediately unless instructed to do otherwise.

Yali also have **acute hearing** and **olfaction** granting them a +2 bonus to avoid surprise in their natural habitat. They can track the scent of creatures for up to 6 miles with the equivalent of three ranks of Tracking proficiency. They are **quite agile** (Acrobatics 12+) and **good climbers**, able to ascend sheer surfaces as if they were thieves (6+). Their **lightning reflexes** grant a +1 bonus to initiative.

In lieu of biting, yali can lash an opponent with their long, serpentine tails. If a yali’s tail attack succeeds, the target is **restrained**.

###### Ecology

When yali are encountered in a wilderness den, the adults will be raising yali cubs. Roll 1d10 for age and number: 1-6, 1d3-1 juvenile yali, 7-10 1d3 baby yali. Juvenile yali have AC 3, Spd 120’, HD 4+2, and attack with 2 claws (1d4 {S!}) and a bite (1d10 {P!}). Baby yali have AC 2, Spd 120’, HD 3, and attack with 2 claws (1d2 {S}) and a bite (1d4 {P}).

###### Spoils

A slain yali can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the following components useful in magic research:

* heart (6 4/6 st, 400gp, *discern evil, invuln. to evil*)
* tail (6 4/6 st, 400gp, *halt humanoid, halt monster*)
* tusks (8 2/6 st, 500gp, *striking,* weapon +2)

If not used for magic research, a yali’s two tusks each fetch 1d4 x 25gp and weigh 1 stone for every 450gp value. Its pelt fetches 135gp and weighs 2 2/6 st.

Because of the intense devotion they develop for their masters, yali can only be trained by monster whispering.

### Zombie

Zombies are undead corpses reanimated through dark and sinister magic such as *animate undead* or *undead legion* or through the supernatural workings of **sinkholes of evil**.

Most zombies are created from the corpses of humans, but other corpses can be used. A zombie created from a non-human corpse has a number of HD equal to what the creature possessed in life (excluding class levels) plus one additional HD.

Despite their semblance of life, zombies are effectively walking corpses with only the modicum of sapience. Because of their stupidity, any instructions given to a zombie by its creator or controller must be very simple. In the absence of orders or opponents, zombies simply stumble around aimlessly.

Some zombies are clad in nothing more than the rotting remnants of the clothing they wore in life, but others are armored and armed by their evil masters. A zombie wearing armor adds the AC bonus to its own natural AC of 1.

###### Combat

Unless under another’s control, zombies are automatically Hostile to any living creature they encounter. However, they are **clumsy** and suffer a -2 penalty to initiative rolls.

Zombies can attack with melee weapons (if available) or with natural attacks. Zombies that had natural attacks when living retain their natural attacks as undead. Zombies that had no natural attacks gain a bite attack dealing 1d8 {P} damage (or an average of 2 piercing damage per HD). Zombies with more than 4+1 HD deal extraordinary damage.

Zombies are **immune** to enchantment effects and poisonous damage. They are inherently evil for purposes of *discern evil*and *holy circle*spells. Regardless of their HD, all zombies can be rebuked easily (e.g. as zombies) by casters capable of doing so.

###### Ecology

Zombies that spawn in sinkholes of evil will usually be found lingering in the vicinity of their “birthplace,” though from time to time the pursuit of living creatures that come upon them may draw the zombie away from the sinkhole. Zombies that were created by chaotic spellcasters are frequently used to guard locations or valuable treasure in dungeons.

###### Spoils

A destroyed zombie can be harvested with Animal Husbandry and/or Healing 3 (combined ranks) for the following components useful in magic research:

* brain (2/6 st, 20gp, *deathless minion, rouse the fallen, undead legion*)
* heart (1/6 st, 10gp, *wall of corpses*)
